'''Venous ulcers''' ('''stasis ulcers''', '''varicose ulcers''', or '''ulcus cruris''') are [[wounds]] that are thought to occur due to improper functioning of venous [[venous valve|valves]], usually of the legs.  They are the major cause of [[chronic wound]]s, occurring in 70% to 90% of chronic wound cases.<ref name="pmid16023934">{{cite journal |author=Snyder RJ |title=Treatment of nonhealing ulcers with allografts |journal=Clin. Dermatol. |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=388–95 |year=2005 |pmid=16023934 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2004.07.020}}</ref> Venous ulcers develop mostly along the medial distal leg, and can be very painful.

==Pathophysiology==
The exact [[etiology]] of venous ulcers is not certain, but they are thought to arise when venous valves that exist to prevent backflow of [[blood]] do not function properly, causing the [[pressure]] in veins to increase.<ref name="pmid15223495"/><ref name="pmid15147994">{{cite journal |author=Mustoe T |title=Understanding chronic wounds: a unifying hypothesis on their pathogenesis and implications for therapy |journal=Am.

When [[venous hypertension]] exists, arteries no longer have significantly higher pressure than veins, blood is not pumped as effectively into or out of the area,<ref name="pmid15223495"/><ref name="pmid15147994"/><ref name="pmid15818347"/><ref name="pmid16171604"/> and it pools. 

Venous [[hypertension]] may also stretch veins and allow [[blood protein]]s to leak into the [[extravascular space]], isolating [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) molecules and [[growth factor]]s, preventing them from helping to heal the wound.<ref name="pmid15223495"/><ref name="pmid16171604"/>  Leakage of [[fibrinogen]] from veins as well as deficiencies in [[fibrinolysis]] may also cause [[fibrin]] to build up around the vessels, preventing [[oxygen]] and [[nutrient]]s from reaching [[cell (biology)|cells]].<ref name="pmid15223495"/>  Venous insufficiency may also cause [[white blood cell]]s (leukocytes) to accumulate in small [[blood vessel]]s, releasing inflammatory factors and [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS, [[free radical]]s) and further contributing to chronic wound formation.<ref name="pmid15223495"/><ref name="pmid16171604"/> Buildup of white blood cells in small blood vessels may also plug the vessels, further contributing to [[ischemia]].<ref name="Clark2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic602.htm |title=eMedicine - Reperfusion Injury in Stroke : Article by Wayne M Clark, MD |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}</ref>  This blockage of blood vessels by leukocytes may be responsible for the "[[no reflow phenomenon]]," in which ischemic tissue is never fully reperfused.<ref name="Clark2005"/>  Allowing blood to flow back into the limb, for example by elevating it, is necessary but also contributes to [[reperfusion injury]].<ref name="pmid15147994"/>  Other [[comorbidity|comorbidities]] may also be the root cause of venous ulcers.<ref name="pmid15818347"/>

It is in the [[Crus (lower leg)|crus]] that the classic venous stasis ulcer occurs.  Venous stasis results from damage to the vein valvular system in the lower extremity and in extreme cases allows the pressure in the veins to be higher than the pressure in the arteries.  This pressure results in transudation of inflammatory mediators into the subcutaneous tissues of the lower extremity and subsequent breakdown of the tissue including the skin.

Wounds of the distal lower extremities arising from causes not directly related to venous insufficiency (e.g., scratch, bite, burn, or surgical incision) may ultimately fail to heal if underlying (often undiagnosed) venous disease is not properly addressed.

==Characteristics==
Edema and fibrinous exudate leads to fibrosis of subcutaneous tissues with localized pigment loss and dilation of capillary loops. This is called '''atrophic blanche'''. This can occur around ankles and gives an appearance of inverted champagne bottle to legs. Large ulcers may encircle the leg.
Lymphoedema results from obliteration of superficial lymphatics. There is hypertrophy of overlying epidermis giving polypoid appearance, known as [[lipodermatosclerosis]].

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
A clinical severity score has been developed to assess chronic venous ulcers.  It is based on the CEAP (clinical, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology) classification system developed by an expert panel. A high score gives a poor prognosis.<ref name="pmid15622385">{{cite journal |author=Eklöf B, Rutherford RB, Bergan JJ, et al |title=Revision of the CEAP classification for chronic venous disorders: consensus statement |journal=J. Vasc. Surg. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1248–52 |year=2004 |pmid=15622385 |doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2004.09.027}}</ref>
===Distinction from arterial ulcer===
An [[arterial ulcer]] tends to occur on lateral side of distal leg and leg is pulseless and cool. Venous ulceration is typically seen just above the medial malleolus. Arterial ulcers are seen distally and over bony prominences. Venous ulcer is painless, arterial ulcer is painful.

==Treatment==
The main aim of the treatment is to create such an environment that allows skin to grow across an ulcer.

===Bisgaard regimen===
Most venous ulcers respond to a regimen called Bisgaard regimen for treating ulcers.<ref>{{cite web|title=BMJ responses|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6045?tab=responses|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref> It has four components: Patient education, elevation of foot, elastic compression and evaluation.

===Compression therapy===
Non-elastic, ambulatory, below knee (BK) compression aggressively counters the impact of reflux on venous pump failure. [[Compression therapy]] is used for venous leg ulcers and can decrease blood vessel diameter and pressure, which increases their effectiveness, preventing blood from flowing backwards.<ref name="pmid15223495"/>  Compression is also used <ref name="pmid15223495"/><ref name="pmid15885771">{{cite journal |author=Taylor JE, Laity PR, Hicks J, ''et al.'' |title=Extent of iron pick-up in deforoxamine-coupled polyurethane materials for therapy of chronic wounds |journal=Biomaterials |volume=26 |issue=30 |pages=6024–33 |year=2005 |pmid=15885771 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.03.015}}</ref> to decrease release of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s, lower the amount of fluid leaking from [[capillary|capillaries]] and therefore prevent [[edema|swelling]], and prevent [[clotting]] by decreasing activation of [[thrombin]] and increasing that of [[plasmin]].<ref name="pmid16023934"/>  

Compression is applied using elastic bandages or boots specifically designed for the purpose.<ref name="pmid15223495"/> It is not clear whether non-elastic systems are better than a multilayer elastic system.<ref name="pmid16973096">{{cite journal |author=Nelson EA, Cullum N, Jones J |title=Venous leg ulcers |journal=Clinical evidence |volume= |issue=15 |pages=2607–26 |year=2006 |pmid=16973096 |doi= |url=http://clinicalevidence.com/ceweb/conditions/wnd/1902/1902.jsp}}</ref> Patients should wear as much compression as is comfortable.<ref name="pmid17012004">{{cite journal |author=Nelson EA, Harper DR, Prescott RJ, Gibson B, Brown D, Ruckley CV |title=Prevention of recurrence of venous ulceration: randomized controlled trial of class 2 and class 3 elastic compression |journal=J.

Surg. |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=803–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17012004 |doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2006.05.051}}</ref>  The type of dressing applied beneath the compression does not seem to matter, and  [[hydrocolloid]] is not better than simple low adherent dressings.<ref name="pmid16855958">{{cite journal |author=Palfreyman SJ, Nelson EA, Lochiel R, Michaels JA |title=Dressings for healing venous leg ulcers |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume=3 |issue= |pages=CD001103 |year=2006 |pmid=16855958 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001103.pub2 |editor1-last=Palfreyman |editor1-first=Simon SJ}}</ref><ref name="pmid17631512">{{cite journal |author=Palfreyman S, Nelson EA, Michaels JA |title=Dressings for venous leg ulcers: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7613 |pages=244 |year=2007 |pmid=17631512 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39248.634977.AE |pmc=1939774}}</ref>

===Pentoxifylline===
A [[meta-analysis]] of [[randomized controlled trials]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found that "Pentoxifylline is an effective adjunct to compression bandaging for treating venous ulcers and may be effective in the absence of compression".<ref name="pmid17636683">{{cite journal |author=Jull A, Arroll B, Parag V, Waters J |title=Pentoxifylline for treating venous leg ulcers |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD001733 |year=2007 |pmid=17636683 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001733.pub2 |editor1-last=Jull |editor1-first=Andrew B}}</ref> It works by reducing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.

===Artificial skin===
[[Artificial skin]], made of collagen and [[cell culture|cultured]] skin cells, is also used to cover venous ulcers and excrete [[growth factor]]s to help them heal.<ref name="Mustoe2005">Mustoe T.  2005.  [http://www.pasteur.fr/applications/euroconf/tissuerepair/Mustoe_abstract.pdf Dermal ulcer healing: Advances in understanding.]  Presented at meeting: Tissue repair and ulcer/wound healing: molecular mechanisms, therapeutic targets and future directions. Paris, France, March 17–18, 2005.  Available.</ref>  A [[meta-analysis]] of [[randomized controlled trials]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded "Bilayer artificial skin, used in conjunction with compression bandaging, increases the chance of healing a venous ulcer compared with compression and a simple dressing".<ref name="pmid17443510">{{cite journal |author=Jones JE, Nelson EA |title=Skin grafting for venous leg ulcers |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD001737 |year=2007 |pmid=17443510 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001737.pub3 |editor1-last=Jones |editor1-first=June E}}</ref>

===Surgical correction of superficial venous reflux===
A [[randomized controlled trial]] found that surgery "reduces the recurrence of ulcers at four years and results in a greater proportion of ulcer free time".<ref name="pmid17545185">{{cite journal |author=Gohel MS, Barwell JR, Taylor M, ''et al.'' |title=Long term results of compression therapy alone versus compression plus surgery in chronic venous ulceration (ESCHAR): randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7610 |pages=83 |year=2007 |pmid=17545185 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39216.542442.BE |pmc=1914523}}</ref>

===TIRS Technique===
Terminal Interruption of Reflux Source Technique entails blocking off the veins that drain the ulcer bed using Sotradecol or Polidocanol foam, administered by ultrasound guidance.<ref>Bush, R. New technique to heal venous ulcers: Terminal interruption of the reflux source (TIRS). Perspectives in Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy. 2010;22(3). http://pvs.sagepub.com/content/22/3/194.abstract</ref>

==Prognosis==
Venous ulcers are costly to treat, and there is a significant chance that they will recur after [[healing]];<ref name="pmid16023934"/><ref name="pmid15223495">{{cite journal |author=Brem H, Kirsner RS, Falanga V |title=Protocol for the successful treatment of venous ulcers |journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=188 |issue=1A Suppl |pages=1–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15223495 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9610(03)00284-8}}</ref> one study found that up to 48% of venous ulcers had recurred by the fifth year after healing.<ref name="pmid15223495"/>

Without proper care, the ulcer may get infected leading to [[cellulitis]] or [[gangrene]] and eventually may need amputation of the part of limb in future.

Some topical drugs used to treat venous ulcer may cause [[venous eczema]]. <ref>{{cite book|title=Roxburgh's Common Skin Diseases, 17ed|isbn=9780340762325|pages=127}}</ref>
