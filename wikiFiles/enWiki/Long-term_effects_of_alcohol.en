==Alcohol-related Death==
Over-consumption of alcohol causes many deaths worldwide.  The overall mortality from alcohol use was found to be similar to that of the effect of physical inactivity.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ|title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data|journal=Lancet|volume=367|issue=9524|pages=1747–57|year=2006|month=May|pmid=16731270|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|url=}}</ref> A review in 2009 found that "the net effect of alcohol consumption on health is detrimental, with an estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years attributable to alcohol."<ref>Jürgen Rehm, Colin Mathers, Svetlana Popova, Montarat Thavorncharoensap, Yot Teerawattananon, Jayadeep Patra [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60746-7/abstract Global burden of disease and injury and economic cost attributable to alcohol use and alcohol-use disorders] ''The Lancet'', Volume 373, Issue 9682, Pages 2223 - 2233, 27 June 2009 {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60746-7}}</ref>

Extensive research of Western cultures has consistently shown increased survival associated with light to moderate alcohol consumption.<ref>Di Castelnuovo A, Costanzo S, Bagnardi V, Donati MB, Iacoviello L, de Gaetano G.  Alcohol dosing and total mortality in men and women: an updated meta-analysis of 34 prospective studies.  Arch Intern Med. 2006 Dec 11-25;166(22):2437-45.</ref> A 23-year [[prospective study]] of 12,000 male [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physician]]s aged 48–78, found that overall mortality was significantly lower in current drinkers compared to non-drinkers even after correction for ex-drinkers.  This benefit was strongest for ischemic heart disease, but was also noted for other vascular disease and respiratory disease.  Death rate amongst current drinkers was higher for 'alcohol augmentable' disease such as liver disease and oral cancers,  but these deaths were much less common than cardiovascular and respiratory deaths. The lowest mortality rate was found for consumption of 8 to 14 'units' per week.  In the UK a unit is defined as 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol.<ref>http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/facts/frequently-asked-questions#what_is_unit</ref> Higher consumption increased overall mortality rate, but not above that of non-drinkers.<ref name="Doll R, Peto R, Boreham J, Sutherland I 2005 199–204">{{cite journal|author=Doll R, Peto R, Boreham J, Sutherland I|title=Mortality in relation to alcohol consumption: a prospective study among male British doctors|journal=Int J Epidemiol|volume=34|issue=1|pages=199–204|year=2005|month=February|pmid=15647313|doi=10.1093/ije/dyh369|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/199}}</ref>

This is consistent with other research that found a J-curve dependency between alcohol consumption and total mortality among middle aged and older men. While the mortality rates of ex-drinkers and heavy drinkers are significantly elevated, the all-cause mortality rates may be 15-18% lower among moderate drinkers. Although the definition of a [[alcohol equivalence|drink]] varies between studies and countries, this meta-analysis found that low levels of alcohol intake, defined as 1-2 drinks per day for women and 2-4 drinks per day for men, was associated with lower mortality than abstainers.<ref name="Di Castelnuovo-">{{Cite journal|last1=Di Castelnuovo|first1=A.|last2=Costanzo|first2=S.|last3=Bagnardi|first3=V.|last4=Donati|first4=MB.|last5=Iacoviello|first5=L.|last6=de Gaetano|first6=G.|title=Alcohol dosing and total mortality in men and women: an updated meta-analysis of 34 prospective studies.|journal=Arch Intern Med|volume=166|issue=22|pages=2437–45|doi=10.1001/archinte.166.22.2437|PMID=17159008}}</ref>This claim was challenged by another study<ref name="Fillmore-2007">{{Cite journal|last1=Fillmore|first1=KM.|last2=Stockwell|first2=T.|last3=Chikritzhs|first3=T.|last4=Bostrom|first4=A.|last5=Kerr|first5=W.|title=Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality risk: systematic error in prospective studies and new hypotheses|journal=Ann Epidemiol|volume=17|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S16-23|month=May|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.01.005|PMID=17478320}}</ref><ref name="Chikritzhs-2009">{{Cite journal|last1=Chikritzhs|first1=T.|last2=Fillmore|first2=K.|last3=Stockwell|first3=T.|title=A healthy dose of scepticism: four good reasons to think again about protective effects of alcohol on coronary heart disease|journal=Drug Alcohol Rev|volume=28|issue=4|pages=441–4|month=Jul|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2009.00052.x|PMID=19594799}}</ref> that found that in certain low quality studies occasional drinkers or ex-drinkers were included as abstainers, resulting in the increased mortality in that group.

==Death Rates in Various Countries==
Many countries collect statistics on alcohol-related deaths. While some categories relate to short-term effects, such as accidents, many relate to long-term effects of alcohol.
<!-- Countries are in alphabetical order -->

===Russia===
{{Main|Alcoholism in Russia}}
One study claims that "excessive alcohol consumption in Russia, particularly by men, has in recent years caused more than half of all the deaths at ages 15-54 years."<ref>IARC [http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/2009/IARCLancet270709.pdf Alcohol causes more than half of all the premature deaths in Russian adults]</ref> However, there are some difficulties with this study. For instance the same study also found a protective effect of heavy drinking on breast cancer mortality. This contradicts the well established scientific view that alcohol increases breast cancer risk.<ref name="Tjønneland-2007">{{Cite journal|last1=Tjønneland|first1=A.|last2=Christensen|first2=J.|last3=Olsen|first3=A.|last4=Stripp|first4=C.|last5=Thomsen|first5=BL.|last6=Overvad|first6=K.|last7=Peeters|first7=PH.|last8=van Gils|first8=CH.|last9=Bueno-de-Mesquita|first9=HB.|title=Alcohol intake and breast cancer risk: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)|journal=Cancer Causes Control|volume=18|issue=4|pages=361–73|month=May|year=2007|doi=10.1007/s10552-006-0112-9|PMID=17364225}}</ref> On this account in further correspondence it was advised that "careful interpretation of mortality statistics in relation to alcohol use is needed, taking into account other relevant risk factors, incidence, and survival."<ref name="Soerjomataram-2009">{{Cite journal|last1=Soerjomataram|first1=I.|last2=de Vries|first2=E.|last3=Coebergh|first3=JW.|title=Did alcohol protect against death from breast cancer in Russia?|journal=Lancet|volume=374|issue=9694|pages=975; author reply 975–6|month=Sep|year=2009|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61657-3|PMID=19766875}}</ref>

The authors replied that "whether or not the apparent shortfall in breast cancer mortality among heavy drinkers is real, it accounts for only about 0·1% of adult deaths in Russia. Careful interpretation of it is therefore of little relevance to the findings for alcohol and overall mortality".

===United Kingdom===
A governmental report from Britain has found that "There were 8,724 alcohol-related deaths in 2007, lower than 2006, but more than double the 4,144 recorded in 1991. The alcohol-related death rate was 13.3 per 100,000 population in 2007, compared with 6.9 per 100,000 population in 1991."<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1091 Alcohol Deaths: Rates stabilise in the UK]</ref> In Scotland, the NHS estimate that in 2003 one in every 20 deaths could be attributed to alcohol.<ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8126129.stm Alcohol 'kills one in 20 Scots'] 30 June 2009</ref>  A 2009 report noted that the death rate from alcohol-related disease was 9,000, a number three times that of 25 years previously.<ref>Sam Lister [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6880210.ece The price of alcohol: an extra 6,000 early deaths a year] ''The Times'', 19 October 2009</ref>

===Sleep===
{{main|Alcohol use and sleep}}

Chronic use of alcohol used to induce sleep can lead to [[insomnia]]. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches and [[diaphoresis]]. Stopping chronic alcohol abuse can also lead to profound disturbances of sleep with vivid dreams. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with [[NREM]] stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of [[REM sleep]] and REM sleep fragmentation. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a [[rebound effect]].<ref name="sleep_medicine_a04">{{Cite book|last1=Lee-chiong|first1=Teofilo|title=Sleep Medicine: Essentials and Review|date=24 April 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s1F_DEbRNMcC&pg=PT105|isbn=0-19-530659-7|page=105}}</ref>

===Diabetes mellitus===
A meta-analysis found with data from 477,200 individuals determined the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group. The search revealed 20 cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria. A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes. Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76–1.00]) and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol (1.01 [0.71–1.44]). Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective (0.60 [0.52–0.69]) and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol (1.02 [0.83–1.26]).

Because former drinkers may be inspired to abstain due to health concerns, they may actually be at increased risk of developing diabetes, known as the sick-quitter effect. Moreover, the balance of risk of alcohol consumption on other diseases and health outcomes, even at moderate levels of consumption, may outweigh the positive benefits with regard to diabetes.

Additionally, the way in which alcohol is consumed (i.e., with meals or bingeing on weekends) affects various health outcomes. Thus, it may be the case that the risk of diabetes associated with heavy alcohol consumption is due to consumption mainly on the weekend as opposed to the same amount spread over a week.<ref name="autogenerated2">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768203/</ref> In the United Kingdom "advice on weekly consumption is avoided".

Also, a twenty year twin study from Finland has shown that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. However, binge drinking and high alcohol consumption was found to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.
