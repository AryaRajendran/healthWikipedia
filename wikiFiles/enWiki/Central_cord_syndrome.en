'''Central cord syndrome''' (CCS) is an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI) that can affect a large and diverse group of patients. It was first described by Schneider in 1954.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schneider RC, Cherry G, Pantek H |title=The syndrome of acute central cervical spinal cord injury; with special reference to the mechanisms involved in [[hyperextension]] injuries of cervical spine |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=546–77 |year=1954 |pmid=13222164 |doi=10.3171/jns.1954.11.6.0546}}</ref>

It has been reported that CCS most frequently occurs among older persons with cervical spondylosis, however, it also may occur in younger individuals.<ref name="pmid17043705">{{cite journal |author=Rich V, McCaslin E |title=Central Cord Syndrome in a High School Wrestler: A Case Report |journal=[[J Athl Train]] |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=341–4 |year=2006 |pmid=17043705 |doi= |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov.library.mmc.org/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17684887 |pmc=1569555}}</ref>

CCS is the most common incomplete SCI syndrome. It accounts for approximately 9% of traumatic SCIs.<ref name="pmid17684887">{{cite journal |author=McKinley W, Santos K, Meade M, Brooke K |title=Incidence and Outcomes of Spinal Cord Injury Clinical Syndromes |journal=J Spinal Cord Med |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=215–24 |year=2007 |pmid=17684887 |doi= |url= |pmc=2031952}}</ref> It is generally associated with favorable prognosis for some degree of neurological and functional recovery. However, factors such as age, preexisting conditions and extent of injury will affect the recovery process.

==Presentation==
It is characterized by disproportionately greater motor impairment in upper compared to lower extremities, and variable degree of sensory loss below the level of injury in combination with bladder dysfunction and urinary retention.<ref name="Harrop 2006 198S-206S">{{cite journal | title = Central cord injury: pathophysiology, management, and outcomes | journal = The Spine Journal | year = 2006 | first = James S | last = Harrop | coauthors = Ashwini Sharan, Jonathon Ratliff | volume = 6 | issue = 6 Suppl. 1 | pages = 198S–206S| id =  | url = http://www.thespinejournalonline.com/article/S1529-9430%2806%2900194-X/abstract | accessdate = 2011-05-02 | pmid=17097539 | doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.04.006}}</ref> This syndrome differs from that of a complete [[lesion]], which is characterized by total loss of all sensation and movement below the level of the injury.

==Causes==
In older patients, CCS most often occurs after a [[hyperextension]] injury in an individual with long-standing [[cervical spondylosis]]. However, this condition is not exclusive to older patients as younger individuals can also sustain an injury leading to CCS. Typically, younger patients are more likely to get CCS as a result of a high-force trauma or a bony instability in the cervical spine.<ref name="Harrop 2006 198S-206S"/><ref name="Nowak 756–765">{{cite journal | title = Central Cord Syndrome | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons | date = 2009-12 | first = Douglas D. | last = Nowak | coauthors = Joseph K. Lee, Daniel E. Gelb, Kornelis A. Poelstra, Steven C. Ludwig | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 756–765| id =  | url = http://jaaos.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/12/756 | accessdate = 2011-05-02 | pmid=19948700}}</ref> Historically, spinal cord damage was believed to originate from concussion or contusion of the cord with stasis of [[axoplasmic]] flow, causing [[edematous]] injury rather than destructive [[hematomyelia]]. More recently, autopsy studies have demonstrated that CCS may be caused by bleeding into the central part of the cord, portending less favorable prognosis. Studies also have shown from postmortem evaluation that CCS probably is associated with selective axonal disruption in the [[lateral column]]s at the level of the injury to the spinal cord with relative preservation of the [[grey matter]].<ref name="Harrop 2006 198S-206S"/>

==Management==
===Nonsurgical===
In many cases, individuals with CCS can experience a reduction in their neurological symptoms with conservative management. The first steps of these intervention strategies include admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) after initial injury. After entering the ICU, early immobilization of the cervical spine with a neck collar would be placed on the patient to limit the potential of further injury.<ref name="Nowak 756–765"/> Cervical spine restriction is maintained for approximately six weeks until the individual experiences a reduction in pain and neurological symptoms.<ref name="Nowak 756–765"/> Inpatient rehabilitation is initiated in the hospital setting, followed by outpatient [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]] to assist with muscle retraining.

An individual with a spinal cord injury may have many goals for outpatient physiotherapy.   Their level of independence, self-care, and mobility are dependent on their degree of neurological impairment.  Rehabilitation organization and outcomes are also based on these impairments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Behrman|first=Andrea, L.|coauthors=Harkema, Susan J.|title=Physical Rehabilitation as an Agent for Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury|journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America|year=2007|volume=18|pages=183–202|pmid=17543768|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2007.02.002|issue=2}}</ref> The physiatrist, along with the rehabilitation team, work with the patient to develop specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-centered goals.
  
With respect to physical therapy interventions, it has been determined that repetitive task-specific sensory input can improve motor output in patients with central cord syndrome. These activities enable the spinal cord to incorporate both supraspinal and afferent sensory information to help recover motor output.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Behram|first=A.L.|coauthors=Harkema, S.J.|title=Physical Rehabilitation as an Agent for Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury|journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics od North America|year=2007|volume=18|pages=183–202|pmid=17543768|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2007.02.002|issue=2}}</ref>  This occurrence is known as "[[activity dependent plasticity]]".  Activity dependant plasticity is  stimulated through such activities as: locomotor training, muscle strengthening, voluntary cycling, and functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yadla|first=S.|coauthors=Klimo, J.; Harrop, J.S.|title=Traumatic Central Cord Syndrome: Etiology, Management, and Outcomes|journal=Topics in Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation|year=2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=73–84|pmid=17097539|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.04.006}}</ref>

===Surgical===
Surgical intervention is usually given to those individuals who have increased instability of their cervical spine, which cannot be resolved by conservative management alone. Further indications for surgery include a neurological decline in spinal cord function in stable patients as well as those who require cervical [[spinal decompression]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Traumatic Central Cord Syndrome: Etiology, Management, and Outcomes | journal = Topics in Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation | year = 2010 | first = Sanjay | last = Yadla | coauthors = Paul Klimo, James S.
