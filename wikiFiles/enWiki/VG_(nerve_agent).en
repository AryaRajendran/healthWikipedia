'''VG''' ([[IUPAC]] name: '''''O'',''O''-diethyl ''S''-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothioate''') (also called '''Amiton''' or '''Tetram''') is a "V-series" [[nerve agent]] chemically  similar to the better-known [[VX (nerve agent)|VX nerve agent]]. Tetram is the common Russian name for the substance.  Amiton was the trade name for the substance when it was marketed as an [[insecticide]] by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in the mid-1950s. 

With a toxicity of about 1/10 that of [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], i.e. similar to that of [[sarin]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/cwco/download/table2_summary_schedules_relevance_cw_amended.pdf |accessdate=2006-10-07|title=Summary of CWC-Schedules and their Relevance to Chemical Warfare|work=Australia's National Authority for the Chemical Weapons Convention}}</ref> it is now considered too dangerous for use in agriculture<ref>

During the early 1950s at least three chemical companies working on organo-phosphorus insecticides independently discovered the amazing toxicity of these chemicals.<ref name="opcw-nerve">{{cite web | url =

Like the earlier German investigators of organophosphates in the late 1930s who had discovered the [[Nerve_agent#G-Series|G-series]] nerve agents, Dr. Ghosh discovered that their action on [[cholinesterase]] made them effective pesticides. One of them, Amiton, was described in a 1955 paper by Ghosh and another chemist, J. F. Newman, as being particularly effective against [[mite]]s.<ref name="opcw-nerve"/> It was brought to market as an insecticide by the company in 1954 but was subsequently withdrawn as too toxic.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbwinfo.com/Chemical/Nerve/nervgen.shtml|work=The site for information about chemical and biological weapons for emergency, safety and security personnel|title=Nerve Agents: General|accessdate=2006-10-07}}</ref> 

The toxicity of these substances had not passed unnoticed by the [[British Government]], as some of the compounds had already been sent to their research facility at [[Porton Down]] for evaluation.  Some of the chemicals from this class of compounds formed a new group of nerve agents called [[Nerve_agent#V-Series|V Agents]]. The British Government unilaterally renounced chemical and biological weapons in 1956, although in 1958 traded their research on VX technology with the [[United States Government]] in exchange for information on [[thermonuclear weapons]]. The US then went into production of large amounts of the chemically similar, but much more toxic VX in 1961.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061112085443/http://www.mitretek.org/AShortHistoryOfTheDevelopmentOfNerveGases.htm | accessdate=2006-10-07| title=A Short History of the Development of Nerve Gases | work=Mitrek Systems}}</ref>
