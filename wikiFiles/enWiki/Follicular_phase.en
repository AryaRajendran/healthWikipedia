The ''follicular phase'' (or '''proliferative phase''') is the phase of the [[estrous cycle]], (or, in humans and [[great ape]]s, the [[menstrual cycle]]) during which follicles in the [[ovary]] mature. It ends with [[ovulation]]. The main hormone controlling this stage is [[estradiol]].<!--

==Hormonal events==
===Follicle recruitment===
[[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) is secreted by the [[anterior pituitary]] [[gland]].  FSH secretion begins to rise in the last few days of the previous menstrual cycle,<!--

These follicles, that have been growing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance.{{Cn|date=February 2013}} 

FSH induces the proliferation of [[granulosa cell]]s in the developing follicles, and the expression of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) receptors on these granulosa cells.  Under the influence of FSH, [[aromatase]] and [[p450]] enzymes are activated, causing the granulosa cells to begin to secrete [[estrogen]].  This increased level of estrogen stimulates production of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH), which increases production of LH.<ref name="tcoyf" /><ref name="silverthorn" />  LH induces [[androgen]] synthesis by thecal cells, stimulates proliferation, differentiation, and secretion of follicular thecal cells and increases LH receptor expression on granulosa cells.<ref name="silverthorn" />

Throughout the entire follicular phase, rising estrogen levels in the blood stimulates growth of the [[endometrium]] and [[myometrium]] of the [[uterus]].<ref name=vander678>{{cite book|last=Strang|first=Eric P. Widmaier, Hershel Raff, Kevin T.|title=Vander's human physiology the mechanisms of body function|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=0-07-111677-X|pages=678|edition=10th}}</ref>  It also causes endometrial cells to produce receptors for [[progesterone]],<ref name=vander678 /> which helps prime the endometrium to respond to rising levels of progesterone during the late proliferative phase and throughout the luteal phase.

===Estrogen surge===
Two or three days before LH levels begin to increase,<ref name="tcoyf" /> usually by day seven of the cycle,<!--

Many endocrinologists believe that the estrogen secretion of the dominant follicle has increased to a level that GnRH production is suppressed, which lowers the levels of LH and FSH.  This slowdown in LH and FSH production leads to the ''atresia'' (death) of most of the recruited follicles, though the dominant follicle continues to mature.  Estrogen levels will continue to increase for several days (on average, six days, but this varies widely).<ref name="tcoyf" />

These high estrogen levels initiate the formation of a new layer of [[endometrium]] in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium.  Crypts in the [[cervix]] are also stimulated to produce fertile cervical mucus.<ref name="tcoyf" />  This mucus reduces the acidity of the [[vagina]], creating a more hospitable environment for [[spermatozoon|sperm]].<ref>Weschler (2002), p.57</ref>  It also has a characteristic texture that helps guide sperm through the cervix<ref>Weschler (2002), illustrations p.59 and p.3 of color insert</ref> and to the [[fallopian tube]]s, where they wait for ovulation.<!--

===LH surge and ovulation===
Estrogen levels are highest right before the LH surge begins.  The short-term drop in steroid hormones between the beginning of the LH surge and the event of ovulation may cause mid-cycle spotting or bleeding.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.65</ref>  Under the influence of the preovulatory LH surge, the first [[meiosis|meiotic]] division of the [[oocytes]] is completed.  The surge also initiates luteinization of thecal and granulosa cells.<ref name="silverthorn" />  Ovulation normally occurs 30 (± 2) hours after the beginning of the LH surge (when LH is first detectable in urine).<!--

==Follicular waves==
The time from recruitment of tertiary stage follicles to ovulation is normally about two weeks, comprising days 1-14 of an idealized 28-day menstrual cycle.  However, it is common for the follicular phase to last much longer, as sometimes no dominant follicle is selected.  In this case, normally more tertiary stage follicles are recruited and the process begins again.  One study of women with regular menstrual cycles found that none of them ovulated after the first wave of follicle development: 68% of cycles showed ovulation after the second wave, while 32% of cycles showed ovulation after the third wave.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baerwald A, Adams G, Pierson R | title = A new model for ovarian follicular development during the human menstrual cycle | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–22 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12849812 | doi = 10.1016/S0015-0282(03)00544-2}}</ref>  [[Fertility awareness]] sources may refer to multiple waves of follicular development as a ''split peak'' because of the characteristic pattern of cervical mucus changes that is sometimes observed.<ref>Weschler (2002), pp.131-2</ref>
