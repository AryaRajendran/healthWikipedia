'''Samter's triad''' is a medical condition consisting of [[asthma]], [[salicylate sensitivity|aspirin sensitivity]], and nasal/ethmoidal [[polyposis]].<ref name="pmid17702319">{{cite journal |author=Kim JE, Kountakis SE |title=The prevalence of Samter's triad in patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery |journal=Ear, nose, & throat journal |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=396–9 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17702319 |doi= |url=}}</ref> It occurs in middle age<ref name="urlCurrent Management of Nasal Polyposis">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/oto/grand/090398.html |title=Current Management of Nasal Polyposis |work= |accessdate=2008-11-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> (twenties and thirties are the most common onset times)<ref name="Aspirin Desensitization">{{cite web |url=http://care.american-rhinologic.org/aspirin |author=Kevin C.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most commonly, the first symptom is [[rhinitis]] (inflammation or irritation of the nasal mucosa), which can manifest with symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, or congestion. The disorder typically progresses to asthma, then nasal polyposis, with aspirin sensitivity coming last. The reactions to aspirin vary, but can be severe, ranging from mild nasal congestion and eye watering to lower respiratory symptoms including wheezing, coughing, an asthma attack, [[anaphylaxis]], and [[urticaria]] in some cases. Patients typically react to other [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]], and any medication that inhibits the COX-1 enzyme, although [[paracetamol]] ([[acetaminophen]]) in low doses<ref>Settipane RA, Schrank PJ, Simon RA, Mathison DA, Christiansen SC, Stevenson DD. Prevalence of cross-sensitivity with acetaminophen in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. 1995 Oct;96(4):480-5.</ref> is generally considered safe.

[[Anosmia]] (lack of smell) is also common, as the inflammation reaches the olfactory receptors in the nose.

== Cause ==
The disorder is caused by an anomaly in the [[arachidonic acid]] cascade, which causes increased production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, a series of chemicals involved in the body's inflammatory response. When medications like NSAIDs or aspirin block the COX-1 enzyme, [[prostaglandin]] and [[thromboxane]] production is decreased, which causes the overproduction of leukotrienes and produces the severe asthma and allergy-like effects. Arachidonic acid can be metabolized through four major pathways namely cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2), lipoxygenases (5-LOX, 15-LOX, and 12-LOX) cytochrome oxidases (hydrolase, epoxygenase) or non-enzymatic pathway. Reduced PGE2 production compared to aspirin tolerant asthmatics along with reduced baseline EP2 receptor expression and elevated PGD2(TH2/eosinophil chemoattractant) production in aspirin sensitive asthma cripples the COX pathway. This relive the inhibitory effects of PGE2 on cysteinyl leukotrienes shunting towards 5-LOX pathway. over expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 and reduced production of cysteinyl leukotriene antagonists called lipoxins also contributes to the disease.<ref>Arun Narayanankutty, Juan Manuel Reséndiz-Hernández, Ramcés Falfán-Valencia, Luis M. Terán. Biochemical pathogenesis of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Clinical Biochemistry. available online on 2012 Dec 13. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.12.005. PMID 23246457.</ref> Although the underlying cause is not fully understood, the attachment of platelets to certain leukocytes in the blood may contribute to the overproduction of leukotrienes.<ref>Laidlaw TM, Kidder MS, Bhattacharyya N, Xing W, Shen S, Milne GL, Castells MC, Chhay H, Boyce JA. Cysteinyl leukotriene overproduction in aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease is driven by platelet-adherent leukocytes. Blood. 2012 Jan 18.</ref>

There may be a relationship between aspirin-induced asthma and ''[[TBX21]]'', ''[[PTGER2]]'', and ''[[LTC4S]]''.<ref>{{OMIM|208550}}</ref>

In addition to aspirin, other vaso-dilators may induce the same reaction, such as alcohol.

== Treatment ==
=== Medication ===
The preferred treatment now is desensitization to aspirin, undertaken at a clinic or hospital specializing in such treatment.  In the United States, the Scripps Clinic in San Diego, CA,<ref>http://www.scripps.org/locations/scripps-clinic/services/immunology__immunology/services__specialized-services__aspirin-desensitization__frequently-asked-questions</ref> the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA,<ref>http://www.massgeneral.org/allergy/</ref> the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA<ref>http://aerd.partners.org/</ref>, and Stanford University Adult ENT Clinic have allergists who routinely perform aspirin desensitization procedures for patients with aspirin-induced asthma.  Patients who are desensitized then take a maintenance dose of aspirin daily; they have reduced need for supporting medications and fewer asthma and sinusitis symptoms than previously; many have an improved sense of smell. 

Treatment formerly focused on relieving the symptoms. Even desensitized people may continue to use nasal steroids, inhaled steroids, and [[leukotriene]] antagonists. 

Leukotriene antagonists and inhibitors ([[montelukast]], [[zafirlukast]], and [[zileuton]]) are helpful in treating Samter's. 

Some patients require oral steroids to alleviate asthma and congestion, and most patients will have recurring or chronic sinusitis due to the nasal inflammation. Desensitization to aspirin reduces the chance of recurrence, and can slow the regrowth of the nasal polyps.

=== Surgery ===
Occasionally surgery may be required to remove polyps,<ref name="pmid17181095">{{cite journal |author=McMains KC, Kountakis SE |title=Medical and surgical considerations in patients with Samter's triad |journal=American journal of rhinology |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=573–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17181095 |doi= 10.2500/ajr.2006.20.2913|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=1050-6586&volume=20&issue=6&spage=573&aulast=McMains}}</ref> although they typically recur, particularly if desensitization is not undertaken.

===Diet===
A diet low in [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6 oils]] (precursors of arachidonic acid), and high in [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3 oils]], may also help.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} 

Some people find relief of symptoms by following a low-salicylate diet such as the [[Feingold diet]].  They may need to eliminate the other salicylate-containing foods identified by Swain in 1985 as well.<ref name="Swain85">

}}</ref>  For those who need them, these salicylates are listed in charts in the Feingold Handbook based on level of salicylate measured in the item. Unfortunately, any such list is only a rough guideline since amounts will vary depending on fruit/vegetable variety and where grown; in fact, organic foods have been shown to contain more salicylate than conventional produce because the plant is more likely to be under attack from pests, and salicylate is produced by the plant as protection.<ref name="Baxter2001">

* Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome ([[NARES]])

==History==
It is named for [[Max Samter]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2240}}</ref>

Initial reports on the link between asthma, aspirin and nasal polyposis were made by Widal in 1922.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Widal MF|title=Anaphylaxie et idiosyncraise|language=French|journal=Press Med|year=1922|volume=119|pages=48–51}}</ref> Further studies were done by Samter & Beers in reports published in 1968.<ref name="pmid5646829">{{cite journal |author=Samter M, Beers RF |title=Intolerance to aspirin.
