'''Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome''' ('''CFC''') is an extremely rare and serious [[genetic disorder]].<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |page=550 |edition=10th}}</ref><ref name="Fitz2">{{cite book |author=Freedberg, ''et al.'' |title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-138076-0 |page=513 |edition=6th}}</ref>

It is characterized by the following:

*Distinctive facial appearance
*Unusually sparse, brittle, curly scalp hair
*A range of skin abnormalities from dermatitis to thick, scaly skin over the entire body (generalized [[ichthyosis]])
*Heart malformations ([[congenital]] or appearing later) especially an obstruction of the normal flow of blood from the lower right [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] of the heart to the lungs (valvar [[pulmonary stenosis]])
*Delayed growth
*Foot abnormalities (extra toe or fusion of two or more toes)

==Malformations of face and head==
Individuals with the disorder usually have distinctive malformations of the craniofacial area including an unusually large head (macrocephaly), prominent forehead, and abnormal narrowing of both sides of the forehead (bitemporal constriction); The nose can be upturned and short with a low nasal bridge; and large ears that are abnormally rotated toward the back of the head. In many cases, affected individuals also have downward slanting eyelid folds, widely spaced eyes, drooping of the upper eyelids, inward deviation of the eyes, and other eye abnormalities including absent eyebrows and eyelashes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Genetic causes of CFC==
[[Costello syndrome|Costello]] and [[Noonan syndrome]] are similar to CFC and their phenotypic overlap may be due to the biochemical relationship of the genes mutated in each syndrome to each other.  Genes that are mutated in all three of these syndromes encode proteins that function in the [[MAP kinase]] pathway.  

* Mutations that cause CFC are found in the [[KRAS]], [[BRAF]], [[MEK1]] and [[MEK2]] genes.
* Costello syndrome is caused by mutations in [[HRAS]].
* Mutations that cause Noonan Syndrome have been found in [[PTPN11]] and [[SOS1]].

The relative severity of CFC when compared to Noonan Syndrome may reflect the position in the biochemical pathway each gene occupies.  
* Shp2, the protein product of the PTPN11, appears to regulate the MAP kinase pathway at or above the level of SOS1.
* SOS1 in turn regulates the activities of [[Ras (protein)|RAS]], [[c-Raf|RAF]], MEK, [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|ERK]] and [[Ribosomal S6 kinase|p90RSK]].
* SOS1 has been demonstrated to be a target of negative feedback by ERK and p90RSK.

Thus, any activating mutation downstream of SOS1 may be subject to less regulation that may mitigate the consequence of such mutations giving rise to the phenotypic differences seen between these syndromes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bentires-Alj M, Kontaridis MI, Neel BG |title=Stops along the RAS pathway in human genetic disease |journal=Nat.
