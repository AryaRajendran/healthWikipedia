The '''medial collateral ligament''' ('''MCL''' or '''tibial collateral ligament''') is one of the four major [[ligament]]s of the [[knee]].  It is on the [[Human_anatomical_terms#Anatomical_directions|medial]] (inner) side of the [[knee]] joint in humans and other primates.

==Structure==
It is a broad, flat, membranous band, situated slightly posterior on the medial side of the knee joint. It is attached proximally to the medial [[epicondyle]] of femur immediately below the [[adductor tubercle]]; below to the [[medial condyle of tibia|medial condyle of the tibia]] and medial surface of its body. It resists forces that would push the knee medially, which would otherwise produce [[valgus deformity]].

The fibers of the posterior part of the ligament are short and incline backward as they descend; they are inserted into the tibia above the groove for the [[semimembranosus]] muscle.

The anterior part of the ligament is a flattened band, about 10 centimeters long, which inclines forward as it descends.

It is inserted into the medial surface of the body of the tibia about 2.5 centimeters below the level of the condyle.

Crossing on top of the lower part of the MCL is the [[pes anserinus (leg)|pes anserinus]], the joined tendons of the [[sartorius muscle|sartorius]], [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]], and [[semitendinosus]] muscles; a bursa is interposed between the two.

The MCL's deep surface covers the [[inferior medial genicular]] vessels and nerve and the anterior portion of the tendon of the [[semimembranosus]] muscle, with which it is connected by a few fibers; it is intimately adherent to the [[medial meniscus]].

Embryologically and phylogenically, the ligament represents the distal portion of the tendon of [[adductor magnus]] muscle. In lower animals, adductor magnus inserts into the tibia. Because of this, the ligament occasionally contains muscle fibres. This is an [[atavism|atavistic]] variation.

==Causes of injury==
{{main|Medial knee injuries}}
An MCL injury can be very painful and is caused by a [[valgus stress]] to a slightly bent knee, often when landing, bending or on high impact. It may be difficult to apply pressure on the injured leg for at least a few days.

===Skiing===
The most common knee structure damaged in [[skiing]] is the medial collateral ligament, although the [[carve turn]] has diminished the incidence somewhat.<ref>[http://www.ski-injury.com/knee.htm Knee injuries<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===American football===
MCL strains and tears are fairly common in [[American football]]. The [[Center (American football)|center]] and the [[guard (American football)|guards]] are the most common victims of this type of injury due to the grip trend on their cleats, although sometimes it can be caused by a helmet striking the knee. The number of football players who get this injury has increased in recent years. Companies are currently trying to develop better cleats that will prevent the injury.

==Treatment==
{{main|Medial knee injuries}}
Depending on the grade of the injury, the lowest grade (grade 1) can take between 2 and 10 weeks for the injury to fully heal. Recovery times for grades 2 and 3 can take weeks to several months.

Treatment of a partial tear or stretch injury is usually conservative. Physical Therapy should be a first choice option for treatment and diagnosis of injuries to this structure. This includes measures to control inflammation as well as bracing.  Kannus has shown good clinical results with conservative care of grade II sprains, but poor results in grade III sprains.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kannus P |title=Long-term results of conservatively treated medial collateral ligament injuries of the knee joint |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research |volume= |issue=226 |pages=103–12 |year=1988 |month=January |pmid=3335084}}</ref> As a result, more severe grade III and IV injuries to the MCL that lead to ongoing instability may require arthroscopic surgery.  However, the medical literature considers surgery for most MCL injuries to be controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Indelicato PA |title=Isolated Medial Collateral Ligament Injuries in the Knee |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=10790648 |url=http://www.jaaos.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10790648}}</ref>  Isolated MCL sprains are common.

For higher grade tears of the MCL with ongoing instability, the MCL can be sutured or replaced.  Other non-surgical approaches for more severe MCL injuries may include [[prolotherapy]], which has been shown by Reeves in a small RCT to reduce translation on KT-1000 arthrometer versus placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reeves KD, Hassanein K |title=Randomized prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study of dextrose prolotherapy for knee osteoarthritis with or without ACL laxity |journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=68–74, 77–80 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10710805}}</ref> The future of non-surgical care for a non-healing MCL injury with laxity (partial ligament tear) is likely bioengineering.  Fan et al. (2008) have demonstrated that knee ligament reconstruction is possible using mesenchymal stem cells and a silk scaffold.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fan H, Liu H, Wong EJ, Toh SL, Goh JC |title=In vivo study of anterior cruciate ligament regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and silk scaffold |journal=Biomaterials |volume=29 |issue=23 |pages=3324–37 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18462787 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.012}}</ref>
