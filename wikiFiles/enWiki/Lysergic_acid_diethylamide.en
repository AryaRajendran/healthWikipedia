'''Lysergic acid diethylamide''', abbreviated '''LSD''' or '''LSD-25''', also known as '''lysergide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) and colloquially as '''acid''', is a [[semisynthetic]] [[psychedelic drug]] of the [[ergoline]] family, well known for its psychological effects which can include altered thinking processes, closed and open eye visuals, [[synesthesia]], an altered [[sense of time]] and [[religious experience|spiritual experiences]], as well as for its key role in [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]]. It is used mainly as an [[entheogen]], [[recreational drug use|recreational drug]], and as an agent in [[psychedelic therapy]]. LSD is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low [[Therapeutic window|toxicity relative to dose]]. However, adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, and delusions are possible.<ref name="Passie-2008">{{cite journal |author=Passie T, Halpern JH, Stichtenoth DO, Emrich HM, Hintzen A |title=The Pharmacology of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: a Review |journal=CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=295–314 |year=2008 |month= |pmid=19040555 |doi= 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00059.x|url=http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/2008/2008_Passie_23067_1.pdf}}</ref>

LSD was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Albert Hofmann]] in 1938 from [[ergotamine]], a chemical derived by [[Arthur Stoll]] from [[ergot]], a [[grain]] [[fungus]] that typically grows on [[rye]]. The short form "LSD" comes from its early code name ''LSD-25'', which is an abbreviation for the German "Lysergsäure-diethylamid" followed by a sequential number.<ref name="problem-child">Hofmann, Albert. ''[http://www.psychedelic-library.org/child.htm LSD—My Problem Child]'' (McGraw-Hill, 1980). ISBN 0-07-029325-2.</ref><ref name="tihkal" />  LSD is sensitive to [[oxygen]], [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]], and [[chlorine]], especially in [[solution]], though its potency may last for years if it is stored away from light and moisture at low temperature. In pure form it is a colorless, odorless, tasteless solid.<ref>{{cite web |title= LSD – My Problem Child (English translation) |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ehn/Web/release/problem-child.html |author=[[Albert Hofmann]] }}</ref> LSD is typically delivered orally, usually on a substrate such as absorbent [[Blotting paper|blotter paper]], a [[sugar|sugar cube]], or [[gelatin]]. In its liquid form, it can also be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection. LSD is very potent, with 20–30 [[Micrograms|µg]] (micrograms) being the threshold dose.
New experiments with LSD started in 2009 for the first time in 40 years.<ref name="greiner" />

Introduced by [[Sandoz Laboratories]], with trade-name '''Delysid''', as a drug with various [[psychiatric]] uses in 1947, LSD quickly became a [[psychedelic psychotherapy|therapeutic agent]] that appeared to show great promise.<ref>Arthur Stoll and Albert Hofmann [http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/lsdpatent.html LSD Patent] April 30, 1943 in Switzerland and Mar. 23, 1948 in the United States.</ref> In the 1950s, officials at the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) thought the drug might be applicable to [[mind control]] and [[chemical warfare]]; the agency's [[MKULTRA]] research program propagated the drug among young servicemen and students. The subsequent recreational use of the drug by [[youth culture]] in the [[Western world]] during the 1960s led to a political firestorm that resulted in its [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants#Legal status and attitudes|prohibition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2006/January/LSD.asp |title=LSD: cultural revolution and medical advances |accessdate=2007-09-27 |work=Royal Society of Chemistry }}</ref> Currently, a number of organizations—including [[Beckley Foundation|the Beckley Foundation]], [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|MAPS]], [[Heffter Research Institute]] and the [[Albert Hofmann]] Foundation—exist to fund, encourage and coordinate research into the medicinal and spiritual uses of LSD and related psychedelics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmann.org/ |title=The Albert Hofmann Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-27 |work=Hofmann Foundation }}</ref>

== Effects ==

=== Physical ===
LSD can cause [[Mydriasis|pupil dilation]], reduced or increased appetite, and wakefulness. Other physical reactions to LSD are highly variable and nonspecific, some of which may be secondary to the psychological effects of LSD. Among the reported symptoms are numbness, weakness, nausea, [[hypothermia]] or [[hyperthermia]], elevated [[blood sugar]], [[goose bumps]], heart rate increase, jaw clenching, perspiration, [[saliva]] production, [[mucus]] production, sleeplessness, [[hyperreflexia]], and [[tremor]]s. Some users, including Albert Hofmann, report a strong metallic taste for the duration of the effects.<ref>{{cite book

=== Psychological ===
LSD's psychological effects (colloquially called a "trip") vary greatly from person to person, depending on factors such as previous experiences, state of mind and environment, as well as dose strength. They also vary from one trip to another, and even as time passes during a single trip. An LSD trip can have long-term psychoemotional effects; some users cite the LSD experience as causing significant changes in their personality and life perspective{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. Widely different effects emerge based on what [[Timothy Leary]] called ''[[set and setting]]''; the "set" being the general mindset of the user, and the "setting" being the physical and social environment in which the drug's effects are experienced.

Some psychological effects may include an experience of radiant colors, objects and surfaces appearing to ripple or "breathe", colored patterns behind the closed eyelids (eidetic imagery), an altered sense of time (time seems to be stretching, repeating itself, changing speed or stopping), crawling geometric patterns overlaying walls and other objects, morphing objects, a sense that one's thoughts are spiraling into themselves, loss of a sense of identity or the ego (known as "[[ego death]]"), and other powerful psycho-physical reactions.<ref>{{cite web

The drug sometimes leads to disintegration or restructuring of the user's historical personality and creates a mental state that some users report allows them to have more choice regarding the nature of their own personality.

If the user is in a hostile or otherwise unsettling environment, or is not mentally prepared for the powerful distortions in perception and thought that the drug causes, effects are more likely to be unpleasant than if he or she is in a comfortable environment and has a relaxed, balanced and open mindset.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

=== Sensory ===
LSD causes an altered sensory experience of [[sense]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[memory|memories]], [[time]], and [[awareness]] for 6 to 14 hours, depending on dosage and tolerance. Generally beginning within thirty to ninety minutes after ingestion, the user may experience anything from subtle changes in perception to overwhelming [[cognitive shift]]s. Changes in auditory and visual perception are typical.<ref name="linton-langs" /><ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> Visual effects include the illusion of [[motion aftereffect|movement of static surfaces]] ("walls breathing"), [[after image]]-like trails of moving objects ("tracers"), the appearance of moving colored geometric patterns (especially with closed eyes), an intensification of colors and brightness ("sparkling"), new textures on objects, blurred vision, and shape suggestibility. Users commonly report that the inanimate world appears to animate in an unexplainable way; for instance, objects that are static in three dimensions can seem to be moving relative to one or more additional spatial dimensions.<ref>See, ''e.g.,'' Gerald Oster's article "[http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1966/1966_oster_3875_1.pdf Moiré patterns and visual hallucinations]". ''Psychedelic Rev.'' No. 7 (1966): 33–40.</ref> Many of the basic visual effects resemble the [[phosphene]]s seen after applying pressure to the eye and have also been studied under the name "[[form constant]]s". The auditory effects of LSD may include [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]-like distortions of sounds, changes in ability to discern concurrent auditory stimuli, and a general intensification of the experience of music. Higher doses often cause intense and fundamental distortions of sensory perception such as [[synaesthesia]], the experience of additional spatial or temporal dimensions, and temporary [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]].

== Potential uses ==
[[File:LSD-clinical-trial-bottle.jpg|thumb|Bottle of LSD from a Swiss clinical trial of LSD for anxiety in cancer patients, c. 2007]]

LSD has been used in psychiatry for its perceived therapeutic value, in the treatment of alcoholism, pain and cluster headache relief, for spiritual purposes, and to enhance creativity. However, government organizations like the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|United States Drug Enforcement Administration]] maintain that LSD "produces no aphrodisiac effects, does not increase creativity, has no lasting positive effect in treating alcoholics or criminals, does not produce a 'model psychosis', and does not generate immediate personality change."<ref>{{cite web|author=DEA Public Affairs |url=http://web.petabox.bibalex.org/web/20011116091659/www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/lsd/lsd-4.htm |title=DEA - Publications - LSD in the US - The Drug |publisher=Web.petabox.bibalex.org |date=2001-11-16 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Psychotherapy ===
In the 1950s and 1960s LSD was used in psychiatry to enhance psychotherapy. Some psychiatrists believed LSD was especially useful at helping patients to "unblock" repressed subconscious material through other psychotherapeutic methods,<ref>Cohen, S. (1959). The therapeutic potential of LSD-25. ''A Pharmacologic Approach to the Study of the Mind,'' p251–258.</ref> and also for treating alcoholism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/references/texts/show/1852docid1733 |title=Use of d-lysergic acid diethylamide in the treatment of alcoholism |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmann.org/papers/blewett_1.html |title=Use of d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in the Treatment of Alcoholism |publisher=Hofmann.org |date=2003-11-14 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> One study concluded, "The root of the therapeutic value of the LSD experience is its potential for producing self-acceptance and self-surrender,"<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chwelos N, Blewett D.B., Smith C.M., Hoffer A. | title=Use of d-lysergic acid diethylamide in the treatment of alcoholism | journal=Quart. J. Stud. Alcohol | year=1959 | pages=577–90 | volume=20 | pmid=13810249}}</ref> presumably by forcing the user to face issues and problems in that individual's psyche.

In December 1968, a survey was made of all 74 UK doctors who had used LSD in humans; 73 replied, 1 had moved overseas and was unavailable. The majority of UK doctors with clinical experience with LSD felt that LSD was effective and had acceptable safety:

* 56% (41) continued with clinical use of LSD
* 15% (11) had stopped because of retirement or other extraneous reasons
* 12% (9) had stopped because they found LSD ineffective
* 10% (7) had stopped for unspecified reasons
*  7% (5) had stopped because they felt LSD was too dangerous<ref name="Malleson 1971"/>

====End-of-life anxiety====
From 2008–2011 there has been ongoing research in Switzerland into using LSD to alleviate anxiety for terminally ill cancer patients coping with their impending deaths.  Preliminary results from the study are promising, and no negative effects have been reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bazonline.ch/wissen/medizin-und-psychologie/Psychiater-Gasser-bricht-sein-Schweigen/story/25732295|title=Psychiater Gasser bricht sein Schweigen|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maps.org/research/psilo-lsd/principal_investigator_peter_gasser_m.d._with_co-therapist_barbara_spe/ |title=LSD-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with Life-Threatening Illness |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://santacruz.patch.com/articles/landmark-clinical-lsd-study-nears-completion|title=Landmark Clinical LSD Study Nears Completion|author=David Jay Brown|publisher=Patch.com|date=May 27, 2011}}</ref>

=== Alcoholism ===
Some studies in the 1960s that used LSD to treat alcoholism reduced levels of alcohol misuse in almost 60% of those treated, an effect which lasted six months but disappeared after a year.<ref name="BBC2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17297714 |title=LSD "helps alcoholics to give up drinking"|publisher=BBC |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>Maclean, J.R.; Macdonald, D.C.; Ogden, F.; Wilby, E., "LSD-25 and mescaline as therapeutic adjuvants."

=== Pain ===
LSD was studied in the 1960s by Eric Kast as an [[analgesic]] for serious and chronic [[pain]] caused by [[cancer]] or other  major trauma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kast, Eric |title=Attenuation of anticipation: a therapeutic use of lysergic acid diethylamide |journal=Psychiat. Quart. |year=1967 |pages=646–57 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pmid=4169685 |url=http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1967/1967_kast_3881_1.pdf |doi=10.1007/BF01575629 |format=PDF}}</ref> Even at low (sub-psychedelic) dosages, it was found to be at least as effective as traditional opiates, while being much longer lasting in pain reduction (lasting as long as a week after peak effects had subsided). Kast attributed this effect to a decrease in anxiety; that is to say that patients were not experiencing ''less'' pain, but rather were ''less distressed by'' the pain they experienced. This reported effect is being tested (though not using LSD) in an ongoing (as of 2006) study of the effects of [[psilocybin]] on [[anxiety]] in terminal cancer patients.

=== Cluster headaches ===
LSD has been used as a treatment for [[cluster headache]]s, an uncommon but extremely painful disorder. Researcher Peter Goadsby describes the headaches as "worse than natural childbirth or even amputation without anesthetic."<ref>Goadsby is quoted in "[http://www.maps.org/research/cluster/psilo-lsd/ Research into psilocybin and LSD as cluster headache treatment]", and he makes an equivalent statement in [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s42434.htm an ''Health Report'' interview]{{dead link|date=June 2012}} on Australian [[Radio National]] (August 9, 1999). Pages accessed 2007-01-31.</ref> Although the phenomenon has not been formally investigated, case reports indicate that LSD and [[psilocybin]] can reduce cluster pain and also interrupt the cluster-headache cycle, preventing future headaches from occurring. Currently existing treatments include various [[ergoline]]s, among other chemicals, so LSD's efficacy may not be surprising. A dose-response study testing the effectiveness of both LSD and psilocybin was planned at [[McLean Hospital]], although the current status of this project is unclear. A 2006 study by McLean researchers interviewed 53 cluster-headache sufferers who treated themselves with either LSD or psilocybin, finding that a majority of the users of either drug reported beneficial effects.<ref name="sewell-etal2006">{{cite journal | last=Sewell | first=R.

=== Spiritual ===
LSD is considered an [[entheogen]] because it can catalyze intense spiritual experiences, during which users may feel they have come into contact with a greater spiritual or cosmic order. Users claim to experience lucid sensations where they have "out of body" experiences. Some users report insights into the way the mind works, and some experience permanent shifts in their life perspective. LSD also allows users to view their life from an introspective point of view. Some users report using introspection to resolve unresolved or negative feelings towards an individual or incident that occurred in the past. Some users consider LSD a religious sacrament, or a powerful tool for access to the divine. [[Stanislav Grof]] has written that religious and mystical experiences observed during LSD sessions appear to be phenomenologically indistinguishable from similar descriptions in the sacred scriptures of the great religions of the world and the secret mystical texts of ancient civilizations.<ref name="Grof1979">{{cite book | last = Grof | first = Stanislav | authorlink = Stanislav Grof | coauthors = Joan Halifax Grof| title = Realms of the Human Unconscious (Observations from LSD Research) | publisher = Souvenir Press (E & A) Ltd|year=1979| location = London| pages = 13–14| url = http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/realms_of3.html| doi = | isbn = 0-285-64882-9}}</ref>

=== Creativity ===
In the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists like [[Oscar Janiger]] explored the potential effect of LSD on creativity.

There have been no documented human deaths from an LSD overdose.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00059.x|title=The Pharmacology of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: A Review |publisher=|date=11 November 2008|last1=Passie|first1=Torsten|last2=Halpern|first2=John H.|last3=Stichtenoth|first3=Dirk O.|last4=Emrich|first4=Hinderk M.|last5=Hintzen|first5=Annelie|journal=CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics|volume=14|issue=4|pages=295–314|pmid=19040555}}</ref> It is physiologically well tolerated and there is no evidence for long-lasting physiological effects on the brain or other parts of the human organism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maps.org/research/cluster/psilo-lsd/cns-neuroscience+therapeutics_2008-passie.pdf |title=The Pharmacology of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: A Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>

LSD may temporarily impair the ability to make sensible judgments and understand common dangers, thus making the user more susceptible to accidents and personal injury. It may cause temporary confusion, difficulty with abstract thinking, or signs of impaired memory and attention span.<ref>LSD AND ORGANIC BRAIN IMPAIRMENT S Cohen, AE Edwards - Drug dependence, 1969</ref>

=== Adverse drug interactions ===
There is some indication that LSD may trigger a [[fugue state|dissociative fugue]] state in individuals who are taking certain classes of [[antidepressants]] such as [[lithium salt]]s and [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclics]]. In such a state, the user has an impulse to wander, and may not be aware of his or her actions, which can lead to physical injury. Anonymous anecdotal reports have attributed seizures and one death to the combination of LSD with lithium.<ref name="lsd-antidepressants">"[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_health3.shtml LSD and Antidepressants]" (2003) via [[Erowid]].</ref> [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] noticeably reduce LSD's subjective effects.<ref>Kit Bonson, "[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info4.shtml The Interactions between Hallucinogens and Antidepressants]" (2006).</ref> [[MAOI]]s are also reported to reduce the effects of LSD.<ref name="lsd-antidepressants" />

=== Mental disorders ===
LSD may trigger [[panic attack]]s or feelings of extreme anxiety, colloquially referred to as a "[[bad trip]]". No real prolonged effects have been proven, however people with such conditions as [[LSD and schizophrenia|schizophrenia]] and depression can worsen with LSD.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_health1.shtml |title=Erowid LSD (Acid) Vaults: Health: Excerpt from Strassman's Adverse Reactions to Psychedelic Drugs |publisher=Erowid.org |date=1993-03-25 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>

=== Psychosis ===
There are some cases of LSD inducing a [[psychosis]] in people who appeared to be healthy before taking LSD.<ref>{{cite journal | author=[Rick Strassman | title=Adverse reactions to psychedelic drugs. A review of the literature | journal=J Nerv Ment Dis | year=1984 | pages=577–95 | volume=172 | issue=10|pmid=6384428 | doi=10.1097/00005053-198410000-00001 | unused_data=Strassman RJ]}}</ref> In most cases, the psychosis-like reaction is of short duration, but in other cases it may be chronic. It is difficult to determine whether LSD itself induces these reactions or if it triggers latent conditions that would have manifested themselves otherwise. The similarities of time course and outcomes between putatively LSD-precipitated and other psychoses suggest that the two types of syndromes are not different and that LSD may have been a nonspecific trigger.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Estimates of the prevalence of LSD-induced prolonged psychosis lasting over 48 hours have been made by surveying researchers and therapists who had administered LSD:
* Cohen (1960) estimated 0.8 per 1,000 volunteers (the single case among approximately 1250 study volunteers was the identical twin of a schizophrenic and he recovered within 5 days) and 1.8 per 1,000 psychiatric patients (7 cases among approximately 3850 patients, of which 2 cases were "preschizophrenic" or had previous hallucinatory experience, 1 case had unknown outcome, 1 case had incomplete recovery, and 5 cases recovered within up to 6 months).<ref name="Cohen 1960">{{cite journal|author=Cohen, Sidney|url=http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1960/1960_cohen_1848_1.pdf|title=Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: Side Effects and Complications|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=130|issue=1| pages=30–40|month=January|year=1960|pmid=13811003|format=PDF|doi=10.1097/00005053-196001000-00005}}</ref>
* Malleson (1971) reported no cases of psychosis among experimental subjects (170 volunteers who received a total of 450 LSD sessions) and estimated 9 per 1,000 among psychiatric patients (37 cases among 4300 patients, of which 8 details are unknown, 10 appeared chronic, and 19 recovered completely within up to 3 months).<ref name="Malleson 1971">{{cite journal|author=Malleson, Nicholas|url=http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1971/1971_malleson_5136_1.pdf|title=Acute Adverse Reactions to LSD in Clinical and Experimental Use in the United Kingdom|journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=118|pages=229–30|pmid=4995932|issue=543|year=1971|format=PDF|doi=10.1192/bjp.118.543.229}}</ref>

However, in neither survey study was it possible to compare the rate of lasting psychosis in these volunteers and patients receiving LSD with the rate of psychosis found in other groups of research volunteers or in other methods of psychiatric treatment (for example, those receiving placebo).

Cohen (1960) noted:<ref name="Cohen 1960" />
:"The hallucinogenic experience is so striking that many subsequent disturbances may be attributed to it without further justification. The highly suggestible or hysterical individual would tend to focus on his LSD experience to explain subsequent illness. Patients have complained to Abramson that their LSD exposure produced migraine headaches and attacks of influenza up to a year later. One Chinese girl became paraplegic and ascribed that catastrophe to LSD. It so happened that these people were all in the control group and had received nothing but tap water."

=== Flashbacks and HPPD ===
{{See also|Flashback (psychology)}}

"Flashbacks" are a reported psychological phenomenon in which an individual experiences an episode of some of LSD's subjective effects long after the drug has worn off, usually in the days after typical doses. In some rarer cases, flashbacks have lasted longer, but are generally short-lived and mild compared to the actual LSD "trip".  Flashbacks can incorporate both positive and negative aspects of LSD trips, and are typically elicited by triggers such as alcohol or cannabis use, stress, caffeine, or sleepiness. Flashbacks have proven difficult to study and are no longer officially recognized as a psychiatric syndrome.  However, colloquial usage of the term persists and usually refers to any drug-free experience reminiscent of psychedelic drug effects, with the typical connotation that the episodes are of short duration.

No definitive explanation is currently available for these experiences. Any attempt at explanation must reflect several observations: first, over 70 percent of LSD users claim never to have "flashed back"; second, the phenomenon does appear linked with LSD use, though a causal connection has not been established; and third, a higher proportion of psychiatric patients report flashbacks than other users.<ref name="abrahart">{{cite web

| title = A Critical Review of Theories and Research Concerning Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) and Mental Health
| author = David Abrahart
|year=1998
| accessdate = 2007-02-02}}</ref> Several studies have tried to determine how likely a user of LSD, not suffering from known psychiatric conditions, is to experience flashbacks. The larger studies include Blumenfeld's in 1971<ref>{{cite journal | author=Blumenfield M | title=Flashback phenomena in basic trainees who enter the US Air Force | journal=Military Medicine | year=1971 | pages=39–41 | volume=136 | issue=1 | pmid=5005369}}</ref> and Naditch and Fenwick's in 1977,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Naditch MP, Fenwick S | title=LSD flashbacks and ego functioning | journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology | year=1977 | pages=352–9 | volume=86 | issue=4 | pmid=757972 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.86.4.352}}</ref> which arrived at figures of 20% and 28%, respectively.

Although flashbacks themselves are not recognized as a medical syndrome, there is a recognized syndrome called [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder|Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder]] (HPPD) in which LSD-like visual changes are not temporary and brief, as they are in flashbacks, but instead are persistent, and cause clinically significant impairment or distress. The syndrome is a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] diagnosis. Several scientific journal articles have described the disorder.<ref>See, for example, {{cite journal | author=Abraham HD, Aldridge AM | title=Adverse consequences of lysergic acid diethylamide | journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | year=1993 | pages=1327–34 | volume=88 | issue=10 | pmid=8251869 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02018.x}}</ref>

HPPD differs from flashbacks in that it is persistent and apparently entirely visual (although mood and anxiety disorders are sometimes diagnosed in the same individuals). A recent review suggests that [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder|HPPD]] (as defined in the DSM-IV) is rare and affects only a distinctly vulnerable subpopulation of users.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Halpern JH, Pope HG Jr | title=Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder: what do we know after 50 years? | journal=Drug Alcohol Depend | year=2003 | pages=109–19 | volume=69 | issue=2 | pmid=12609692 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-8716(02)00306-X}}; {{cite journal | author=Halpern JH | title=Hallucinogens: an update | journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep | year=2003 | pages=347–54 | volume=5 | issue=5 | pmid=13678554 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-003-0067-4|url=http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=6224}}</ref>  However, it is possible that the prevalence of HPPD is underestimated because most of the diagnoses are applied to people who are willing to admit to their health care practitioner that they have previously used psychotropics, and presumably many people are reluctant to admit this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpdd.vcu.edu/Pages/Meetings/Meetings_PDFs/2006abstractbook.pdf |author= Baggott et al. |year=2006 |title= Prevalence of chronic flashbacks in hallucinogen users: a web-based questionnaire |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

There is no consensus regarding the nature and causes of HPPD (or flashbacks).  A study of 44 HPPD subjects who had previously ingested LSD showed [[EEG]] abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Abraham, H. D., & Duffy, F. H. |year=(1996) | title=Stable quantitative EEG difference in post-LSD visual disorder by split-half analysis: Evidence for disinhibition | journal=Psychiatry Research | volume=67 | issue=3 | pages= 173–187 | doi=10.1016/0925-4927(96)02833-8 | pmid=8912957}}</ref> Given that some symptoms have environmental triggers, it may represent a failure to adjust visual processing to changing environmental conditions.  There are no explanations for why only some individuals develop HPPD.  Explanations in terms of LSD physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence.<ref name="abrahart" /> Some say HPPD is a manifestation of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], not related to the direct action of LSD on brain chemistry, and varies according to the susceptibility of the individual to the disorder. Many emotionally intense experiences can lead to flashbacks when a person is reminded acutely of the original experience. However, not all published case reports of HPPD appear to describe an anxious hyper-vigilant state reminiscent of post-traumatic stress disorder. Instead, some cases appear to involve only visual symptoms.<ref name="abrahart" />

=== Uterine contractions ===
Early pharmacological testing by Sandoz in laboratory animals showed that LSD can stimulate uterine contractions, with efficacy comparable to [[Ergoline#Lysergic acid amides|ergobasine]], the active uterotonic component of the [[ergot]] fungus. (Hofmann's work on ergot derivatives also produced a modified form of [[Ergonovine|ergobasine]] which became a widely accepted medication used in [[obstetrics]], under the trade name [[Ergoline#Lysergic acid amides|Methergine]].) Therefore, LSD use by pregnant women could be dangerous and is [[contraindication|contraindicated]].<ref name="problem-child" /> However, the relevance of these animal studies to humans is unclear, and a 2008 medical reference guide to drugs in pregnancy and lactation stated, "It appears unlikely that pure LSD administered in a controlled condition is an [[abortifacient]]."<ref name="Briggs2008">{{cite book | author = Gerald G. Briggs,Roger K. Freeman,Sumner J. Yaffe | title = Drugs in pregnancy and lactation | year = 2008 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | url = http://books.google.com/?id=YOEV2w3XTxsC | isbn = 978-0-7817-7876-3}}</ref>

=== Genetic ===
Beginning in 1967, studies raised concerns that LSD might produce genetic damage<ref name="dishotsky">{{cite journal | author=Dishotsky NI, Loughman WD, Mogar RE, Lipscomb WR | title=LSD and genetic damage | journal=Science | year=1971 | pages=431–40 | volume=172 | issue=3982| url=http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1971/1971_dishotsky_5148_1.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.172.3982.431|format=PDF | pmid=4994465}}</ref> or developmental abnormalities in fetuses. However, these initial reports were based on ''in vitro'' studies or were poorly controlled and have not been substantiated. In studies of [[chromosome|chromosomal]] changes in human users and in monkeys, the balance of evidence suggests no increase in chromosomal damage. For example, [[white blood cell]]s of people who had been given LSD in a clinical setting were examined for visible chromosomal abnormalities; overall, there appeared to be no lasting changes.<ref name="dishotsky"/>  Several studies have been conducted using illicit LSD users and provide a less clear picture. Interpretation of these data is generally complicated by factors such as the unknown chemical composition of street LSD, concurrent use of other [[psychoactive drug]]s, and diseases such as [[hepatitis]] in the sampled populations. It seems possible the small number of genetic abnormalities reported in users of street LSD is either coincidental or related to factors other than a toxic effect of pure LSD.<ref name="dishotsky" /> A 2008 medical review concluded, "The available data suggest that pure LSD does not cause chromosomal abnormalities, spontaneous abortions, or congenital malformations.
In 1969 Moseley (now Gottschalk) working at the University of California, Riverside, under Edward Crellin Pauling, using e. coli ligase mutant strain obtained results indicating no breakage and that therapeutically high doses actually reduced breakage."<ref name="Briggs2008"/>

=== Treatment of intoxication ===
Reassurance in a calm, safe environment is beneficial. Agitation can be safely addressed with [[benzodiazepine]]s such as Valium, but [[neuroleptic]]s such as Haldol should be avoided because they may cause hallucinations or paranoid delusions. LSD is rapidly absorbed, so activated charcoal and emptying of the stomach may be of little benefit in the emergency department. Sedation or physical restraint is rarely required, and excessive restraint may cause complications such as [[hyperthermia]] (over-heating) or [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=Medscape>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1011615-treatment|title=LSD Toxicity Treatment & Management|work=Medscape|author=Brenner S & Corden TE|date=22 March 2012|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>

Massive doses require supportive care, which may include [[endotracheal intubation]] or respiratory support. High blood pressure, [[tachycardia]] (rapid heart-beat) and hyperthermia, if present, should be treated symptomatically. Treat low blood pressure initially with fluids and then with [[pressor]]s if necessary. Intravenous administration of [[anticoagulants]], [[vasodilators]], and [[sympatholytics]] may be useful with massive doses. Balloon percutaneous transluminal [[angioplasty]] has been employed in some severe cases.<ref name=Medscape/>

== Chemistry and structure ==
[[File:Lysergide stereoisomers structural formulae v.2.png|thumb|The four possible stereoisomers of LSD. Only (+)-LSD is psychoactive.]]

LSD is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound with two [[stereocenter]]s at the [[carbon]] atoms C-5 and C-8, so that theoretically four different [[optical isomerism|optical isomers]] of LSD could exist. LSD, also called (+)-<small>D</small>-LSD, has the [[absolute configuration]] (5''R'',8''R''). The C-5 [[isomer]]s of lysergamides do not exist in nature and are not formed during the synthesis from <small>D</small>-lysergic acid. [[Retrosynthesis|Retrosynthetically]], the C-5 stereocenter could be analysed as having the same configuration of the alpha carbon of the naturally occurring amino acid L-[[tryptophan]], the precursor to all biosynthetic ergoline compounds.

However, LSD and iso-LSD, the two C-8 isomers, rapidly interconvert in the presence of [[base (chemistry)|bases]], as the alpha proton is acidic and can be [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] and reprotonated. Non-psychoactive iso-LSD which has formed during the synthesis can be separated by [[chromatography]] and can be isomerized to LSD.

A totally pure salt of LSD will emit small flashes of white light when shaken in the dark.<ref name="tihkal" /> LSD is strongly [[fluorescent]] and will glow bluish-white under [[UV light]].

===Synthesis===
LSD is an [[ergoline]] derivative. It is commonly synthesised by reacting [[diethylamine]] with an activated form of [[lysergic acid]]. Activating reagents include [[phosphoryl chloride]]<ref name="synth1">{{cite journal |author=Monte AP, Marona-Lewicka D, Kanthasamy A, Sanders-Bush E, Nichols DE |title=Stereoselective LSD-like activity in a series of d-lysergic acid amides of (R)- and (S)-2-aminoalkanes |journal=J.

=== Reactivity and degradation ===
"LSD," writes the chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]], "is an unusually fragile molecule."<ref name="tihkal" /> It is stable for indefinite time if stored as a solid salt or dissolved in water, at low temperature and protected from air and light exposure.

LSD has two labile protons at the tertiary stereogenic C5 and C8 positions,  rendering these centres prone to epimerisation. The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing carboxamide attachment, but removal of the chiral proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule [[tryptophan]]) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the indole ring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

LSD also has [[enamine]]-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, [[chlorine]] destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.<ref name="tihkal" /> The [[covalent bond|double bond]] between the 8-position and the [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic ring]], being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to nucleophilic attacks by water or alcohol, especially in the presence of light. LSD often converts to "lumi-LSD", which is inactive in human beings.<ref name="tihkal" />

A controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Li Z., McNally A. J., Wang H., Salamone S. J.

The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25°C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37°C and up to a 40% at 45°C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].

Estimates for the [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) of LSD range from 200&nbsp;µg/kg to more than 1&nbsp;mg/kg of human body mass, though most sources report that there are no known human cases of such an overdose. Other sources note one report of a suspected fatal overdose of LSD occurring in November 1975 in [[Kentucky]] in which there were indications that ~1/3 of a gram (320&nbsp;mg or 320,000&nbsp;µg) had been injected intravenously. (This is a very extraordinary amount, equivalent to over 3,000 times the average LSD dosage of ~100&nbsp;µg).<ref name="erowid-dosage">{{cite web| url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose.shtml

=== Detection in biological fluids ===
LSD may be quantified in urine as part of a drug abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 871-874.</ref>

== Pharmacodynamics ==
[[File:LSDaffinities.GIF|thumb|Binding affinities of LSD for various receptors. The lower the [[dissociation constant]] (K<sub>i</sub>), the more strongly LSD binds to that receptor (i.e. with higher affinity). The horizontal line represents an approximate value for human plasma concentrations of LSD, and hence, receptor affinities that are above the line are unlikely to be involved in LSD's effect.

LSD affects a large number of the [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], including all [[dopamine receptor]] subtypes, and all [[Adrenergic receptor|adrenoreceptor]] subtypes, as well as many others. LSD binds to most [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] subtypes except for [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]] and [[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub>]].

Beginning in the 1950s the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began a research program code named [[Project MKULTRA]]. Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions, usually without the subject's knowledge. The project was revealed in the US congressional [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission report]] in 1975.

In 1963 the Sandoz patents expired on LSD.<ref name="henderson-glass"/> Also in 1963, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] classified LSD as an [[Investigational New Drug]], which meant new restrictions on medical and scientific use.<ref name="henderson-glass"/> Several figures, including [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Timothy Leary]], and [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard|Al Hubbard]], began to advocate the consumption of LSD.

== Production ==
[[File:LSDLabGlassware.jpg|left|thumb|Glassware seized by the DEA]]

An active dose of LSD is very minute, allowing a large number of doses to be synthesized from a comparatively small amount of raw material. Five kilograms of precursor [[ergotamine]] [[tartrate]] can produce 5&ndash;6&nbsp;kg of pure crystalline LSD; this corresponds to 100 million doses. Because the masses involved are so small, concealing and transporting illicit LSD is much easier than smuggling other illegal drugs like [[cocaine]] or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name="DEA-pub">{{cite web

Manufacturing LSD requires laboratory equipment and experience in the field of [[organic chemistry]]. It takes two to three days to produce 30 to 100&nbsp;grams of pure compound. It is believed that LSD is not usually produced in large quantities, but rather in a series of small batches. This technique minimizes the loss of precursor chemicals in case a step does not work as expected.<ref name="DEA-pub" />

=== Forms ===
[[File:5 LSD blotters.png|thumb|Five doses of LSD, often called a "five strip"]]

LSD is produced in crystalline form and then mixed with [[excipient]]s or redissolved for production in ingestible forms. Liquid solution is either distributed in small vials or, more commonly, sprayed onto or soaked into a distribution medium. Historically, LSD solutions were first sold on sugar cubes, but practical considerations forced a change to [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form. Appearing in 1968 as an orange tablet measuring about 6&nbsp;mm across, "Orange Sunshine" acid was the first largely available form of LSD after its possession was made illegal. [[Tim Scully]], a prominent chemist, made some of it, but said that most "Sunshine" in the USA came by way of [[Ronald Stark]], who imported approximately thirty-five million doses from Europe.<ref name=Stafford1992>{{cite book

Over a period of time, tablet dimensions, weight, shape and concentration of LSD evolved from large (4.5–8.1&nbsp;mm diameter), heavyweight (≥150&nbsp;mg), round, high concentration (90–350&nbsp;µg/tab) dosage units to small (2.0–3.5&nbsp;mm diameter) lightweight (as low as 4.7&nbsp;mg/tab), variously shaped, lower concentration (12–85&nbsp;µg/tab, average range 30–40&nbsp;µg/tab) dosage units. LSD tablet shapes have included cylinders, cones, stars, spacecraft and heart shapes. The smallest tablets became known as "Microdots".<ref name=Laing2003>{{cite book

=== Modern distribution ===
LSD manufacturers and traffickers in the [[United States]] can be categorized into two groups: A few large-scale producers, and an equally limited number of small, clandestine chemists, consisting of independent producers who, operating on a comparatively limited scale, can be found throughout the country.<ref>^ Maclean, J.R.; Macdonald, D.C.; Ogden, F.; Wilby, E., "LSD-25 and mescaline as therapeutic adjuvants."

== Legal status ==
{{globalize/Eng|section|date=January 2013}}
The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] (adopted in 1971) requires its parties to prohibit LSD. Hence, it is illegal in all parties to the convention, which includes the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe. However, enforcement of extant laws varies from country to country. Medical and scientific research with LSD in humans is permitted under the 1971 UN Convention.<ref>UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 [http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf Final act of the United Nations Conference]</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, LSD is a Schedule 1 Class 'A' drug. This means it has no recognised legitimate uses and possession of the drug without a license is punishable with 7 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, and trafficking is punishable with life imprisonment and an unlimited fine (''see main article on drug punishments [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]).''

In 2000, after consultation with members of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]' Faculty of Substance Misuse, the UK Police Foundation issued the [[Runciman Report]] which recommended ''"the transfer of LSD from Class A to Class B"''.<ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/runciman/pf3.htm Drugs and the law: Report of the inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971] London: Police Foundation, 2000, [[Runciman Report]]</ref>

In November 2009, the UK [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] released in the House of Commons a guidebooks to the legal regulation of drugs, ''After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation'', which details options for regulated distribution and sale of LSD and other psychedelics.<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation] Transform Drug Policy Foundation 2009</ref>

=== United States ===
LSD is Schedule I in the United States, according to the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.<ref>From [http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/lsd.html]: ''LSD is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act.''</ref> This means LSD is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a DEA license. By classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] holds that LSD meets the following three criteria: it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse; it has no legitimate medical use in treatment; and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision. There are no documented deaths from chemical toxicity; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1011615-overview |title=Toxicity, Hallucinogens - LSD |publisher=Emedicine.medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>

There can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the U.S. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v. U.S.''<ref>{{cite court

Lysergic acid and lysergic acid amide, LSD precursors, are both classified in [[Schedule III (US)|Schedule III]] of the Controlled Substances Act. Ergotamine tartrate, a precursor to lysergic acid, is regulated under the [[Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act]].

== Notable individuals ==
Some notable individuals have commented publicly on their experiences with LSD.<ref>{{cite web |title=Famous LSD users |url=http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com/articles/famous_users/lsd.htm |publisher=The Good Drugs Guide |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://popwiki.net |title=People on psychedelics  |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref> Some of these comments date from the era when it was legally available in the US and Europe for non-medical uses, and others pertain to [[psychiatric]] treatment in the 1950s and 1960s. Still others describe experiences with illegal LSD, obtained for philosophic, artistic, therapeutic, spiritual, or recreational purposes.
* [[Richard Feynman]], a notable physicist at [[California Institute of Technology]] tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech. Feynman largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes; he mentions it in passing in the "O Americano, Outra Vez" section.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard P. |last=Feynman |title=[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]: Adventures of a Curious Character |editor=Ralph Leighton |publisher=[[W.

* [[Steve Jobs]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Apple Inc.]], said, "Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life."<ref>{{cite web |last=Bosker |first=Bianca |title=The Steve Jobs Reading List: The Books And Artists That Made The Man |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/21/the-steve-jobs-reading-list-the-books_n_1024021.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=23 October 2011 |date=21 October 2011}}</ref>
* In a 2004 interview, [[Paul McCartney]] said that [[The Beatles]]' songs "[[Day Tripper]]" and "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" are about LSD, although [[John Lennon]] explicitly declared that "Lucy" was never about LSD but rather inspired by a picture drawn by his son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Sheff| first=David| year=2000| authorlink=David Sheff| title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono| publisher=St. Martin's Press| location=New York| isbn=0-312-25464-4| ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/music/hidden/lucysky.asp |title=Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds LSD |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]] also experimented with the drug, although McCartney cautioned that "it's easy to overestimate the influence of drugs on the Beatles' music."<ref name="weeklystandard">{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/197vgrel.asp?page=1|title=The Truth Behind "LSD"|last=Matus|first=Victorino|date=June 2004|publisher=The Weekly Standard}}</ref>

* [[Aldous Huxley]], author of ''[[Brave New World]]'', became a user of psychedelics after moving to [[Hollywood]]. He was at the forefront of the counterculture's experimentation with psychedelic drugs, which led to his 1954 work ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''. Dying of cancer, on November 22, 1963, he asked his wife to inject him with 100&nbsp;µg of LSD. He died from the cancer later that day.<ref name=OpenCulture>{{cite web|last=Colman|first=Dan|title=Aldous Huxley’s LSD Death Trip|url=http://www.openculture.com/2011/10/aldous_huxleys_lsd_death_trip.html|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>
