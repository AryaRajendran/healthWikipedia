This in turn results in an increase in the [[synapse|synaptic]] [[concentration]]s of one or more of these neurotransmitters and therefore an increase in [[monoaminergic]] [[neurotransmission]].

The majority of currently approved [[antidepressant]]s act as MRIs including the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and most of the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs).<ref name="FinkelClark2008">{{cite book | author1 = Richard Finkel | author2 = Michelle Alexia Clark | author3 = Pamela C.

==Types of MRIs==
There are a variety of different kinds of MRIs, of which include the following:

* Selective for one monoamine transporter
** [[Serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI)
** [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (NRI)
** [[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI)

* Non-selective, binding to two or more monoamine transporters
** [[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI)
** [[Serotonin-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (SDRI)
** [[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (NDRI)
** [[Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNDRI)

Refer to the above articles for more information on MRIs.
