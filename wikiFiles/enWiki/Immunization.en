'''Immunization''', or '''immunisation''', is the process by which an individual's [[immune system]] becomes fortified against an agent (known as the [[antigen|immunogen]]).

When this system is exposed to [[molecule]]s that are foreign to the body, called ''non-self'', it will orchestrate an immune response, and it will also develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of [[immunological memory]]. This is a function of the [[adaptive immune system]]. Therefore, by exposing an animal to an immunogen in a controlled way, its body can learn to protect itself: this is called active immunization.

The most important elements of the immune system that are improved by immunization are the [[T cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and the [[Antibody|antibodies]] B cells produce. [[Memory B cell]] and [[memory T cells]] are responsible for a swift response to a second encounter with a foreign molecule. Passive immunization is when these elements are introduced directly into the body, instead of when the body itself has to make these elements.

Immunization is done through various techniques, most commonly [[vaccination]]. Vaccines against [[microorganism]]s that cause [[disease]]s can prepare the body's immune system, thus helping to fight or prevent an [[infection]]. The fact that [[mutation]]s can cause [[cancer]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to produce proteins or other molecules that are unknown to the body forms the theoretical basis for therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]]s. Other molecules can be used for immunization as well, for example in experimental vaccines against [[nicotine]] ([[NicVAX]]) or the hormone [[ghrelin]] in experiments to create an obesity vaccine.

Before vaccines, the only way people became immune to a certain disease was by actually getting the disease and surviving it.  Immunizations are definitely less risky and an easier way to become immune to a particular disease.  They are important for both adults and children in that they can protect us from the many diseases out there.  Through the use of immunizations, some infections and diseases have almost completely been eradicated throughout the United States and the World.  One for example is polio.  Thanks to dedicated health care professionals and the parents of children who vaccinated on schedule, polio has been eliminated in the U.S. since 1979.  Polio is still found in other parts of the world though so certain people could still be at risk of getting it. This includes those people who have never had the vaccine, those who didn't receive all doses of the vaccine, or those traveling to areas of the world where polio is still prevalent.  

Active immunization/vaccination has been named one of the "Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century".<ref name=CDC/>

Immunization can be achieved in an active or passive manner: vaccination is an active form of immunization.

===Active immunization===
{{main|Active immunity}}

Active immunization can occur naturally when a person comes in contact with, for example, a microbe. If the person has not yet come into contact with the [[microbe]] and has no pre-made antibodies for defense, as in passive immunization, the person becomes immunized. The immune system will eventually create antibodies and other defenses against the microbe. The next time, the immune response against this microbe can be very efficient; this is the case in many of the childhood infections that a person only contracts once, but then is immune.

Artificial active immunization is where the microbe, or parts of it, are injected into the person before they are able to take it in naturally. If whole microbes are used, they are pre-treated, [[Attenuated vaccine]].

The importance of immunization is so great that the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has named it one of the "Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century".<ref name=CDC>[http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/tengpha.htm "Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century".] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]</ref>

===Passive immunization===
{{main|Passive immunity}}
Passive immunization is where pre-synthesized elements of the immune system are transferred to a person so that the body does not need to produce these elements itself. Currently, [[antibodies]] can be used for passive immunization. This method of immunization begins to work very quickly, but it is short lasting, because the antibodies are naturally broken down, and if there are no B cells to produce more antibodies, they will disappear.

Passive immunization occurs physiologically, when [[antibodies]] are transferred from mother to [[fetus]] during [[pregnancy]], to protect the fetus before and shortly after birth.

Artificial passive immunization is normally administered by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] and is used if there has been a recent outbreak of a particular disease or as an emergency treatment for toxicity, as in for [[tetanus]]. Treatment of this sort is often the subject of case based learning in first year medical curricula. The antibodies can be produced in animals, called "serum therapy," although there is a high chance of [[anaphylactic shock]] because of immunity against animal serum itself. Thus, [[humanized antibodies]] produced ''[[in vitro]]'' by [[cell culture]] are used instead if available.
