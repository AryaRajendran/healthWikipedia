A '''Baker's cyst''', also known as a [[popliteal fossa|popliteal]] [[cyst]], is a benign swelling of the semimembranous or more rarely some other [[ synovial bursa]] found behind the [[knee|knee joint]]. It is named after the [[surgery|surgeon]] who first described it, [[William Morrant Baker]] (1838–1896).<ref>{{cite web | title=William Morrant Baker | url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/649.html | publisher=[[Who Named It]]}}</ref> This is not a "true" [[cyst]], as an open communication with the synovial sac is often maintained.

==Cause==

In adults, Baker's cysts usually arise from almost any form of knee [[arthritis]] (e.g. [[rheumatoid arthritis]]) or [[cartilage]] (particularly a [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]]) tear.  Baker's cysts can also be associated with [[tear of meniscus]] and rarely with [[Lyme disease]]. Baker's cysts in children do not point to underlying joint disease. Baker's cysts arise between the tendons of the medial head of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]] and the [[semimembranosus muscle]]s. They are posterior to the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial femoral condyle]].

The [[synovium|synovial]] sac of the knee joint can, under certain circumstances, produce a posterior bulge, into the [[Popliteal fossa|popliteal space]], the space behind the knee. When this bulge becomes large enough, it becomes palpable and cystic. Most Baker's cysts maintain this direct communication with the [[Synovial joint|synovial]] cavity of the knee, but sometimes, the new cyst pinches off. A Baker's cyst can rupture and produce acute pain behind the knee and in the calf and swelling of the [[Triceps surae|calf muscles]].

==Diagnosis==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}

Diagnosis is by examination. A baker's cyst is easier to see from behind with the patient standing with knees fully extended. It is most easily palpated (felt) with the knee partially flexed. Diagnosis is confirmed by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]], although if needed and there is no suspicion of a [[popliteal artery]] [[aneurysm]] then aspiration of synovial fluid from the cyst may be undertaken with care. An [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] image can reveal presence of a Baker's cyst. 

A burst cyst can cause calf pain, swelling and redness that may mimic [[thrombophlebitis]] or a potentially life-threatening [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) which may need to be excluded by urgent blood tests and ultrasonography. Although an infrequent occurrence, a Baker's cyst can compress vascular structures and cause leg edema and a true DVT.

==Treatment==
Baker's cysts usually require no treatment unless they are [[symptomatic]]. It is very rare that the symptoms are actually coming from the cyst.  In most cases, there is another disorder in the knee (arthritis, meniscal tear, etc) that is causing the problem.  Initial treatment should be directed at correcting the source of the increased fluid production.  Often rest and leg elevation are all that is needed. If necessary, the cyst can be [[Aspirator (medical device)|aspirated]] to reduce its size, then injected with a [[corticosteroid]] to reduce inflammation. [[surgery|Surgical excision]] is reserved for cysts that cause a great amount of discomfort to the patient. A ruptured cyst is treated with rest, leg elevation, and injection of a corticosteroid into the knee.  Recently, [[prolotherapy]] has shown encouraging results as an effective way to treat Baker's cysts and other types of [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] conditions.<ref name="pmid15864836">{{cite journal |author= |title=Alternative treatments.

Baker's cysts in children, unlike in older people, nearly always disappear with time, and rarely require excision.

===Cryotherapy===
[[Ice pack therapy]] may sometimes be effective way of controlling the pain caused by Baker's cyst. Do not apply ice directly to the skin, always wrap in cloth first, the cloth can be damp if preferred, direct application of ice to skin can cause ice burns. Alternatively, cooling packs may be used, but the total application time for any product is for no more than 15 minutes every hour.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Medication===
Medications bought at [[pharmacies]] may be used to help soothe pain. Painkillers with [[paracetamol]], a.k.a. acetaminophen (e.g., [[Tylenol]]), or with the additional [[anti-inflammatory]] action (such as [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]]), may be used. Stronger [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s may be required by [[medical prescription|prescription]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Heat===
Heat is also commonly used. The application of a [[heating pad]] on a low setting for 10–20 minutes may relieve some pain, but only if instructions are followed carefully.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Bracing===
A knee [[Brace (orthopaedic)|brace]] can offer support giving the feel of stability in the joint. If only support is necessary, a simple elastic bandage is recommended; however, braces compress the back of the knee, where it is most tender, and can cause pain.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Rest and specific exercise===
Many activities can put strain on the knee, and cause pain in the case of Baker's cyst. Avoiding activities such as squatting, kneeling, heavy lifting, climbing, and even running can help prevent pain. Despite this, some exercises can help relieve pain, and a [[physiotherapist]] may instruct on stretching and strengthening the [[quadriceps]] and/or the [[patellar ligament]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
