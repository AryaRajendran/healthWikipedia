An '''osteoclast''' (from the Greek words for "bone" (Οστό) and "broken" (κλαστός)) is a type of [[bone cell]] that removes [[bone tissue]] by removing its mineralized matrix and breaking up the organic bone (organic dry weight is 90% [[collagen]]). This process is known as ''[[bone resorption]]''. Osteoclasts were discovered by Kolliker in 1873.<ref name="cells of bone">{{cite journal | author = Nijweidi Peter J., JEAN H. M.

An osteoclast is a large cell that is 40 micrometer in diameter. It contains 15-20 closely packed oval-shaped nuclei. Osteoclasts are found in pits in the bone surface which are called resorption bays, or '''[[John Howship|Howship's]] Lacunae'''. Osteoclasts are characterized by a cytoplasm with a homogeneous, "foamy" appearance. This appearance is due to a high concentration of [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and [[vacuoles]]. These vacuoles are lysosomes filled with acid phophatase. Osteoclast rough endoplasmic reticulum is sparse, and the Golgi complex is extensive.<ref>Standring S., Ed.

At a site of active bone resorption, the osteoclast forms a specialized [[cell membrane]], the "ruffled border," that touches the surface of the bone tissue.<ref name="Netter" />  The ruffled border, which facilitates removal of the bony matrix, is a morphologic characteristic of an osteoclast that is actively resorbing bone. The ruffled border increases surface area interface for bone resorption. The mineral portion of the matrix (called [[hydroxyapatite]]) includes [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] ions. These ions are absorbed into small [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s (see [[endocytosis]]), which move across the cell and eventually are released into the [[extracellular fluid]], thus increasing levels of the ions in the blood.

==Origin==
Since their discovery in 1873 there has been considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and ostoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. At certain times osteoclasts dissociate into osteoblasts, which finally form osteocytes. In the 1970s the biphyletic theory became popular; it states that osteoblasts and osteoclasts are of different lineage. It was in the beginning of 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts.<ref name="cells of bone"/> Osteoclast formation requires the presence of [[RANKL]] (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and [[Macrophage colony-stimulating factor|M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor)]]. These membrane bound proteins are produced by neighbouring [[stromal cells]] and [[osteoblasts]], thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast [Precursor (chemistry)|[precursor]]s.

M-CSF acts through its receptor on the osteoclast, c-fms (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), a transmembrane [[tyrosine kinase]]-receptor, leading to [[secondary messenger]] activation of tyrosine kinase Src. Both of these molecules are necessary for osteoclastogenesis and are widely involved in the [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] of monocyte/macrophage derived cells.

[[RANKL]] is a member of the tumour necrosis family ([[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]]), and is essential in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL knockout mice exhibit a phenotype of [[osteopetrosis]] and defects of tooth eruption, along with an absence or deficiency of osteoclasts. RANKL activates NF-κβ (nuclear factor-κβ) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1) through [[RANK]]. NF-κβ activation is stimulated almost immediately after RANKL-RANK interaction occurs, and is not upregulated. NFATc1 stimulation, however, begins ~24–48 hours after binding occurs and its expression has been shown to be RANKL dependent.

Osteoclast differentiation is inhibited by [[osteoprotegerin]] (OPG), which is produced by osteoblasts and binds to RANKL thereby preventing interaction with RANK.

==Function==
Once activated, osteoclasts move to areas of microfracture in the bone by [[chemotaxis]]. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called '''Howship's lacunae''', formed from the digestion of the underlying bone. The '''sealing zone''' is the attachment of the osteoclast's [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]] to the underlying [[bone]]. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called [[podosome]]s. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific [[amino acid motifs|amino acid motif]] Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as [[osteopontin]]. The osteoclast releases [[hydrogen ion]]s through the action of carbonic anhydrase ([[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] + [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] → [[Bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]]<sup>-</sup> + [[hydrogen ion|H]]<sup>+</sup>) through the '''ruffled border''' into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized [[bone]] [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] into [[Calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]], H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of [[osteopetrosis]].  Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by [[proton pump]]s, specifically a unique vacuolar-[[ATPase]]. This enzyme has been targeted in the prevention of [[osteoporosis]]. In addition, several [[hydrolytic enzyme]]s, such as members of the [[cathepsin]] and matrix metalloprotease(MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]]. These enzymes are released into the compartment by [[lysosome]]s. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, [[cathepsin K]] is of most importance.

===Cathepsin K and other cathepsins===
[[Cathepsin K]] is a collagenolytic, [[papain]]-like, cysteine protease that is mainly expressed in osteoclasts, and is secreted into the resorptive pit. Cathepsin K is the major [[protease]] involved in the degradation of type I collagen and other noncollagenous proteins. Mutations in the cathepsin K gene are associated with pycnodysostosis, a hereditary [[osteopetrosis|osteopetrotic]] disease, characterised by lack of functional cathepsin K expression. Knockout studies of cathepsin K in mice lead to an osteopetrotic phenotype, which, is partially compensated by increased expression of proteases other that cathepsin K and enhanced osteoclastogenesis.

Cathepsin K has an optimal enzymatic activity in acidic conditions. It is synthesized as a proenzyme with a molecular weight of 37kDa, and upon activation by autocatalytic cleavage, is transformed into the mature, active form with a molecular weight of ~27kDa.

Upon polarization of the osteoclast over the site of resorption, cathepsin K is secreted from the '''ruffled border''' into the '''resorptive pit'''.  Cathepsin K transmigrates across the ruffled border by intercellular vesicles and is then released by the functional '''secretory domain'''. Within these intercellular vesicles, cathepsin K, along with [[reactive oxygen species]] generated by [[tartrate resistant acid phosphatase|TRAP]], further degrades the bone extracellular matrix.

Numerous other [[cathepsin]]s are expressed in osteoclasts. These include [[cathepsin B]], [[cathepsin C|C]], D, E, G, and L.  The function of these [[Cysteine protease|cysteine]] and [[aspartic proteases]] is generally unknown within bone, and they are expressed at much lower levels than cathepsin K.

Studies on cathepsin L [[knockout mice]] have been mixed, with a report of reduced [[trabecular bone]] in [[homozygous]] and [[heterozygous]] cathepsin L knockout mice compared to wild-type and another report finding no skeletal abnormalities.

===Matrix metalloproteinases===
The [[matrix metalloproteinases]] (MMPs) comprise a family of more than 20 zinc-dependent endopeptidases. The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in osteoclast biology is ill-defined, but in other tissue they have been linked with tumor promoting activities, such as activation of [[growth factors]] and are required for tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.

'''MMP-9''' is associated with the bone microenvironment. It is expressed by osteoclasts, and is known to be required for osteoclast [[cell migration|migration]] and is a powerful gelatinase. Transgenic mice lacking MMP-9 develop defects in bone development, intraosseous [[angiogenesis]], and fracture repair.

'''MMP-13''' is believed to be involved in bone resorption and in osteoclast differentiation, as knockout mice revealed decreased osteoclast numbers, osteopetrosis, and decreased bone resorption. 

MMPs expressed by the osteoclast include MMP-9, -10, -12, and -14. apart from MMP-9, little is known about their relevance to the osteoclast, however, high levels of MMP-14 are found at the sealing zone.

==Regulation==
Osteoclasts are regulated by several [[hormones]], including [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) from the parathyroid gland, [[calcitonin]] from the thyroid gland,  and [[interleukin|growth factor interleukin 6]] (IL-6). This last hormone, [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], is one of the factors in the disease [[osteoporosis]], which is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely [[osteoprotegerin]] and [[RANKL|RANK ligand]]. Note that these molecules also regulate differentiation of the osteoclast.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schoppet M, Preissner K, Hofbauer L |title=RANK ligand and osteoprotegerin: paracrine regulators of bone metabolism and vascular function |journal=Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=549–53 |year=2002 |pmid=11950689 |doi=10.1161/01.ATV.0000012303.37971.DA}}</ref>

==Alternate use of term==
An osteoclast can also be an instrument used to fracture and reset bones (the origin is Greek ''osteon'':bone and ''klastos'':broken). To avoid confusion, the cell was originally termed osotoclast. When the surgical instrument went out of use, the cell became known by its present name.
