He was a member of the US World [[Figure Skating]] Team and placed second in the US National Pairs Championship in 1973. He came in 3rd place at the 1976 World Professional Pairs Skating Championship in Jaca, Spain skating with Gale Fuhrman<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenskate.com/figure-skating-results/figure-skating-results-professional-and-pro-am-competitions/world-professional-figure-skating-championships-jaca-spain/ |title=World Professional Figure Skating Championships (Jaca, Spain)|accessdate=19 Dec 2012}}</ref> He graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].

Fuhrman is the author of six books, and five journal articles.<ref>[http://www.drfuhrman.com/ask/default.aspx About Dr. Fuhrman]</ref> The Second Edition of ''[[Eat to Live]]'' reached the ''New York Times''  Best Seller list in June, 2011; ''Super Immunity'' reached the ''New York Times'' Best Seller list in October 2012; ''The End of Diabetes'' reached the ''New York Times'' Best Seller list in January 2013.

He created the Health Equation: Health = Nutrients/Calories (abbreviated as H = N/C). This equation signals that future health can be predicted by the [[micronutrient]] per calorie density of the diet.

Joel Fuhrman is featured in the documentaries ''[[A Sacred Duty (film)|A Sacred Duty]]'' (2007), ''[[Simply Raw: Reversing Diabetes in 30 Days]]'' (2009), ''[[Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead]]'' (2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drfuhrman.com/company/fat_sick_nearly_dead.aspx|title=Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead|publisher=DrFuhrman.com}}</ref> and ''[[Vegucated]]'' (2011). In 2011, Fuhrman launched ''3 Steps to Incredible Health!'', a sixty-minute [[PBS]] pledge program that addresses the crisis of obesity and chronic disease plaguing America. In 2012, Fuhrman launched his second [[PBS]] pledge program, entitled ''The Immunity Solution'', which discusses the effect of dietary habits on the immune system and risk of cancer.

Dr. Fuhrman is married and has four children.
