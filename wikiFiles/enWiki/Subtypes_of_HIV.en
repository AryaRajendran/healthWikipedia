The HIV-1 group M viruses predominate and are responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Group M can be further subdivided into subtypes based on genetic sequence data. Some of the subtypes are known to be more [[virulent]] or are resistant to different medications. Likewise, HIV-2 viruses are thought to be less virulent and transmissible than HIV-1 M group viruses, although HIV-2 is known to cause AIDS.

==Major types==

===HIV-1===
HIV-1 is the most common and pathogenic strain of the virus. Scientists divide HIV-1 into a major group (Group M) and two or more minor groups. Each group is believed to represent an independent transmission of SIV into humans (but subtypes within a group are not).<ref name="doi10.1101/cshperspect.a006841"/> Total 39 ORFs are found in all six possible reading frames (RFs) of HIV-1 complete genome sequence.<ref>Dwivedi VD, Pandey A  and  Mishra SK, In-Silico Identification of New Genes in Hiv-1 by ORF Prediction Method. I. Res. J. Biological Sci., 1(7), 52-54(2012)</ref> But only few of them are functional.

;Group M
With 'M' for "major", this is by far the most common type of HIV, with more than 90% of HIV/AIDS cases deriving from infection with HIV-1 group M. The M group is subdivided further into clades, called subtypes, that are also given a letter. There are also "circulating recombinant forms" or CRFs derived from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mmed&part=A2330 recombination] between viruses of different subtypes which are each given a number. CRF12_BF, for example, is a recombination between subtypes B and F.
* Subtype A is common in West Africa.<ref name="pmid15332265">{{cite journal | author = Bobkov AF, Kazennova EV, Selimova LM, ''et al.'' | title = Temporal trends in the HIV-1 epidemic in Russia: predominance of subtype A | journal = J.

* Subtype D is generally only seen in Eastern and central Africa.<ref name="Goudsmit" />

* (Subtype I) was originally used to describe a strain that is now accounted for as CRF04_cpx, with the cpx for a "complex" recombination of several subtypes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
* Subtype J is primarily found in North, Central and West Africa, and the Caribbean<ref name="pmid717053344">{{cite journal | author = Hemelaar J, Gouws E, Ghys PD, Osmanov S. | title = Global and regional distribution of HIV-1 genetic subtypes and recombinants in 2004.| journal = AIDS | volume = 20 | issue = 16 | pages = W13–23 | year = 2006 | month = March | pmid = 17053344 | doi = 10.1097/01.aids.0000247564.73009.bc }}</ref>

;Group N
The 'N' stands for "non-M, non-O". This group was discovered in 1998 and has only been seen in [[Cameroon]]. As of 2006, only 10 Group N infections had been identified.<ref name="doi10.1089/aid.2006.22.83">{{cite journal | author = Julie Yamaguchi, Ruthie Coffey, Ana Vallari, Charlotte Ngansop, Dora Mbanya, Nicaise Ndembi, Lazare Kaptué, Lutz G.

;Group O
The O ("Outlier") group is not usually seen outside of West-central Africa. It is reportedly most common in Cameroon, where a 1997 survey found that about 2% of HIV-positive samples were from Group O.<ref name="pmid9084797">{{cite journal | author = Peeters M, Gueye A, Mboup S, Bibollet-Ruche F, Ekaza E, Mulanga C, Ouedrago R, Gandji R, Mpele P, Dibanga G, Koumare B, Saidou M, Esu-Williams E, Lombart JP, Badombena W, Luo N, Vanden Haesevelde M, Delaporte E | title = Geographical distribution of HIV-1 group O viruses in Africa | journal = AIDS | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 493–8 | year = 1997 | month = March | pmid = 9084797 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199704000-00013 }}</ref> The group caused some concern because it could not be detected by early versions of the HIV-1 test kits.

;Group P
In 2009, a newly analyzed HIV sequence was reported to have greater similarity to a simian immunodeficiency virus recently discovered in wild [[gorillas]] (SIVgor) than to SIVs from chimpanzees (SIVcpz). The virus had been isolated from a [[Cameroon]]ian woman residing in France who was diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 2004. The scientists reporting this sequence placed it in a proposed Group P "pending the identification of further human cases".<ref name="pmid19648927">{{cite journal | author = Plantier JC, Leoz M, Dickerson JE, De Oliveira F, Cordonnier F, Lemée V, Damond F, Robertson DL, Simon F | title = A new human immunodeficiency virus derived from gorillas | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 871–2 | year = 2009 | month = August | pmid = 19648927 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2016 }}</ref><ref name="CBC news HIV P">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/08/03/hiv-africa.html|date=2009-08-03|accessdate=2009-08-03|title=New HIV strain discovered|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}</ref><ref name=millennia>{{cite news |author=[[Donald G.

===HIV-2===

HIV-2 has not been widely seen outside of Africa. The first case in the [[United States]] was in 1987.<ref>[http://www.hivworkshop.com/hiv-2.htm HIV-2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Many test kits for HIV-1 will also detect HIV-2.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cber/products/testkits.htm CBER - Donor Screening Assays for Infectious Agents and HIV Diagnostic Assays<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

As of 2010, there are 8 known HIV-2 groups (A to H). Of these, only groups A and B are epidemic. Group A spread mainly in West Africa, but also to [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], and very limitedly to Europe or the US. Group B is mainly confined to West Africa.<ref name=Santiago2005>{{cite journal |last1=Santiago |first1=M. L. |last2=Range |first2=F. |last3=Keele |first3=B.

HIV-2 is mostly related to [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] endemic in [[sooty mangabey]]s (''Cercocebus atys atys'') (SIVsmm), a monkey species inhabiting the forests of littoral West Africa. Phylogenetic analyses show that the viruses most closely related to the two strains of HIV-2 which spread considerably in humans (HIV-2 groups A and B) are the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest, in western [[Ivory Coast]].<ref name=Santiago2005/>

There are six additional known HIV-2 groups, each having been found in just one person. They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from [[sooty mangabey]]s to humans. Groups C and D have been found in two people from [[Liberia]], groups E and F have been discovered in two people from [[Sierra Leone]], and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the [[Ivory Coast]]. Each of these HIV-2 strains, for which humans are probably [[Host (biology)|dead-end hosts]], is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from [[sooty mangabey]]s living in the same country where the human infection was found.<ref name=Santiago2005/><ref name=Marx2001/>

==Drug resistance mutations==
Isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2 with resistance to antiretroviral drugs arise through genetic mutations, which have been tracked and analyzed. The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and the International AIDS Society publish lists of the most important of these; first year listing 80 common mutations, and the latest year 93 common mutations, and made available through the [[HIV Drug Resistance Database|Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database]].
