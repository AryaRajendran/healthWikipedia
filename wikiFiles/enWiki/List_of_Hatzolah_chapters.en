This is a list of [[Hatzolah]] chapters. Hatzolah is an all volunteer [[Emergency medical services]] organization staffed by [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] [[Emergency medical technician]]s and [[Paramedic]]s. Locations where chapters are situated are listed alphabetically by geography.

Each neighborhood or city in Hatzalah operates independently.<ref name="Affiliates">{{cite web |title=Affiliates|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/affiliates.php}}</ref> There are some exceptions, where there is a tight affiliation with neighboring Hatzolahs, a loose affiliation of neighboring Hatzolahs, or some other basic level of cooperation.

==United States==

===California===
Los Angeles has a chapter which provides [[Basic life support]] level care and relies on the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] for [[Advanced life support]] [[paramedic]] care and transport.. On August 31, 2009 they began direct transport of patients to area hospitals using their own ambulance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/hatzolah-of-los-angeles-begins-emergency-transport-of-basic-life-support-patients-in-fairfaxhancock-park-area |title=Hatzolah of Los Angeles Begins Emergency Transport of Basic Life Support Patients in Fairfax/Hancock Park Area |date=August 31, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68E8pLr4e |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>

The Orthodox community in [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury, CT]], centered around the yeshiva there, has its own Hatzolah.

*[[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami]]  Covers areas of unincorporated North East [[Miami-Dade County]], as well as select portions of the city of [[North Miami Beach]], the city of [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]], and central [[Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://miamihatzalah.com/ | title=Hatzalah of Miami-Dade}}</ref>

*[[Chicago]]<ref name="ChicagoFAQ"/>

===Maryland===
Baltimore started a Hatzalah in 2007 as a first-responder-only service with transport to be done by Baltimore City ambulance units. Currently, Hatzalah of Baltimore does provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) services to the Northwest Baltimore community provided it is in their response area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahbaltimore.org/ |title=Hatzalah of Baltimore: When Every Second Counts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68E7kgLXN |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>

===New Jersey===
New Jersey has many Hatzolah organizations throughout the State. Each NJ affiliate maintains its own emergency phone number, dispatchers, and radio frequencies. While they are not officially connected, as with NYC Hatzolah, many of them are nevertheless loosely affiliated, sharing classes or working at each other's events.  On occasion, all five divisions have worked together to provide joint event coverage or to share training classes.

Per New Jersey law, volunteers with proper permits may equip their cars with blue flashing lights and electronic airhorns, but not red flashing lights, nor sirens. Coordinators' ("officers'") personal vehicles, and any vehicle owned by a squad with a 'No Fee' license plate, are permitted the use of red flashing lights and sirens; not all branches make use of these allowances. Paramedic (ALS) units in New Jersey are only run by hospitals, per state law. The limitation to BLS is not just for Hatzolah and other volunteer agencies: all New Jersey "911" municipal-run EMS services are also limited to BLS. However, see '''Lakewood''' below for a special exception.

*'''Jersey Shore'''  This chapter covers the areas of Deal, West Deal, Long Branch, Eatontown, Alenhurst, Ocean Township, and additional Jersey Shore communities during warmer months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahems.com/ |title=Jersey Shore Hatzalah |publisher=Chevra Hatzalah of The Jersey Shore |location=[[Long Branch, New Jersey]]}}</ref> This is the only Sephardic-run Hatzalah in the United States. (Mexico City, Mexico also has a Sephardic Hatzalah.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahems.com/ |title=Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=Chevra Hatzalah Jersey Shore |location=[[Elberon, New Jersey]]}}</ref>

*'''Elizabeth/Hillside'''
Hatzalah of Union County, with "U-prefix" unit numbers. Union County is geographically and organizationally separate from Union City. With three active ambulances, "the U" also responds to nearby towns including Linden, Union Township, Roselle and Roselle Park, and even to businesses in Newark where slow EMS response may allow the Hatzalah ambulance to complete the 12-14 minute trip from Elizabeth or Hillside before a Newark city crew arrives. Hatzalah of Union County also covers the Jersey Gardens Mall, Newark Liberty Airport, and nearby stretches of the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Two ambulances are located in the greater Elizabeth/Hillside area and the third is located in Roselle.

*'''Lakewood'''
The largest branch in New Jersey, with "L-prefix" unit numbers. Unique to New Jersey, Lakewood has a Paramedic (ALS) unit. The ALS unit is owned and run by MONOC, but the Paramedics are also Lakewood Hatzolah members, and the ambulance was donated by Hatzolah Lakewood to MONOC. This unusual arrangement meets New Jersey's strict hospital-based ALS rules, while giving Hatzolah its own ALS coverage. Also unique, Lakewood has its own Rescue (extrication) unit.

*'''Passaic/Clifton'''
Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton EMS. The neighboring cities have a contiguous Orthodox Jewish community, with most of the community and its institutions on the Passaic side. Likewise, Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton, with "P-prefix" unit numbers, covers both parts of the community, but is primarily based in Passaic, with some members and management in Clifton. This Hatzolah is geographically near Union City, and can provide extra coverage for them. Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton has 30 active members, 20 dispatchers,  two active ambulances and a third on standby, for a community of about 2,000 households.

*'''Union City'''
Hatzolah of Union City http://www.hatzolahuc.com/, is run out of Mosded Sanz-Zviel, which is the center of the Chasidic community in Union City. It is the only Chasidic Hatzolah in New Jersey. Union City is located in Hudson County, and is not related to Union County. Union City uses VHF radios, while all other New Jersey chapters use UHF radios.

===New York===
'''Canarsie/Mill Basin'''</br>
The Canarsie/Mill Basin chapter was originally just the Canarsie division. As the Canarsie Orthodox neighborhood declined, and the Mill Basin one grew, Canarsie started taking more calls and members from nearby Mill Basin, and is now primarily a Mill Basin operation. Canarsie/Mill Basin also covers nearby Georgetown. There are parts of the Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin that border Madison/Midwood/East Midwood, so there is some overlap in coverage with Flatbush.

'''[[Catskill Mountains]]'''</br><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chvac.net/ |title=Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |date=2008-07-21 |publisher=Catskills Hatzalah}}</ref>
This chapter is part of Central Hatzalah of New York City. While the Catskills have a year-round operation, the vast majority of their activity is in July and August, when summer residents arrive.

'''[[Monroe, NY]]'''</br>
The Chasidic community in Kiryas Joel (Monroe), NY has a chapter. Uniquely, it operates separately from all other New York State Hatzolah organizations.

'''New Square'''</br>
This chapter is a breakoff from the Rockland Hatzoloh chapter. Uniquely, the chapter has female Certified First Responders who respond to calls involving [[obstetrics]] related emergencies.

'''New York City Central'''<ref name="Central">{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalah.org |title=Official Web Site|publisher=Chevra Hatzalah of NYC - Central}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/ |title=Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=Chevra Hatzalah |location=[[Brooklyn, New York]]}}</ref></br>
[[File:USA,NewYork,LowerEastSideHatzalah.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A Lower East Side Hatzalah ambulance, New York.]]
This chapter has sixteen local divisions which share rabbinic counsel, [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]], central dispatch and lobbying, but have separate fundraising and management.<ref name="Madrich">{{cite book |title=Madrich L'Chevra Hatzalah |last=Handler |first=Mechel |coauthors=Rabbi Dovid Weinberger |publisher=Feldheim}}</ref>  Catskills, the Five Towns, and Yonkers are the only areas outside of New York City covered by NYC chapters.
The chapter has a central dispatching network with teams of 2 volunteer dispatchers working in tandem. Each dispatch team works several hours on a shift.  The chapter also uses a mobile command center for dealing with large events.

===Pennsylvania===
Philadelphia's Hatzolah has limited service, providing first responder aid only in the Northeast area. Hatzolah of Philadelphia transports are provided by calling in either Patriot Ambulance, or, when the situation warrants, 9-1-1. Patriot Ambulance is a local paid ambulance service owned by a community member. Its owner has also provided Philadelphia Hatzolah with financial assistance, training, and medical guidance to ensure excellence and continuity in patient care. Philadelphia has nine responders, all state certified. Some members are full-time professional EMTs or Paramedics.<ref name="Philly">{{cite web
