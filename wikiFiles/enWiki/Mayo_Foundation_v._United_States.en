'''''Mayo Foundation v. United States''''', 562 U.S. ___ (2011), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld a [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] regulation on the grounds that the courts should defer to government agencies in tax cases in absence of an unreasonable decision on the part of the agency.

Under the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA), students and their educational employers are exempted from paying [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The [[Mayo Foundation]] filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its [[Residency (medicine)|medical residents]]—recently graduated physicians who work more than full time hours providing patient care, but who often have only a limited license to practice medicine and are still considered [[Medical education#Postgraduate education|students]] by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the regulation as within the Treasury Department's statutory authority to issue and as a reasonable construction of FICA. The Court clarified that the deferential standard of ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' (1984) applied, notwithstanding prior Court rulings that had adopted a more stringent standard to tax regulations. Applying ''Chevron'', the Court first found that Congress had left the matter to the agency because the statute was silent on the definition of "student" and its applicability to medical residents specifically. Second, the Court found that the regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and that its clear line helped distinguish workers who study and students who work, simplified enforcement, and furthered the broad coverage of Social Security.

==Background==
In the first decade of the 21st century, the vast majority of medical residents in the United States were physicians who had recently graduated from a [[medical school in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|format=PDF|title=Results and Data: 2010 Main Residency Match |edition=2 |author=[[National Resident Matching Program]] |date=April 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wtKLM50T |archivedate=March 2, 2011 |url=http://www.nrmp.org/data/resultsanddata2010.pdf |page=9}}</ref> While graduating from a medical school provides an individual with a medical degree, a state [[medical license]] is required to practice medicine.

In 1935, the United States Congress passed the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA), which imposed a [[payroll tax]] on workers. The revenues of the tax were meant to be used to finance [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Development of the Social Security Act of 1935: Reflections Some Fifty Years Later.|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=68|year=1983|page=379}}</ref> An amendment to the Act, passed four years later, provided that a "service performed in the employ of... a school, college, or university... if such service is performed by a student enrolled in and regularly attending classes at such school, college, or university" would be exempt.<ref name="NEJM1">{{Cite journal |last1 = Kesselheim | first1 = A.

Until the 1990s, the Act and its application to medical residents were not an issue. Many hospitals assessed and paid FICA taxes on behalf of their employees. The [[University of Minnesota]]'s hospitals did not, however, and in the early 1990s, the [[Social Security Administration]] sued to recover a small portion of those taxes.<ref name="NEJM1" /> An initial administrative review ruled for the Social Security Administration, but the district court reversed. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's decision after granting a ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'' review,<ref>''Minnesota v. Apfel,'' [http://www.law.cornell.edu/socsec/course/readings/151_f3d_742.htm 151 F.3d 742] (8th Cir. 1998)</ref> and the University recovered $40 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Phelps|first1=David|title=High court rules medical residents must pay FICA taxes|date=January 12, 2011|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=[[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/113428849.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> A number of other residency programs quickly filed lawsuits, attempting to recoup the taxes they had paid.<ref name="NEJM1" /> After some of those programs were successful in other [[United States courts of appeals|circuit courts]], the Treasury agreed to repay the taxes it had collected. However, it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in April 2005 that stated that any full time employee, which includes nearly all medical residents, were ineligible to receive the student exemption,<ref group="note">The relevant section of the Treasury's regulation states: "The services of a full-time employee are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The determination of whether an employee is a full-time employee is based on the employer’s standards and practices, except regardless of the employer’s classification of the employee, an employee whose normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week is considered a full-time employee. An employee’s normal work schedule is not affected by increases in hours worked caused by work demands unforeseen at the start of an academic term. However, whether an employee is a full-time employee is reevaluated for the remainder of the academic term if the employee changes employment positions positions with the employer. An employee’s work schedule during academic breaks is not considered in determining whether the employee’s normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week. The determination of an employee’s normal work schedule is not affected by the fact that the services performed by the employee may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect." 26 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R]] [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/26cfr31.3121%28b%29%2810%29-2.pdf §31.3121(b)(10)– 2(d)(3)(iii)]</ref><ref name="NEJM1" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.clhe.org/marketplaceofideas/uncategorized/supreme-court-upholds-irs-regulation-saying-medical-residents-are-students-and-subject-to-fica-tax/|first=Bertrand|last=Harding|title=Supreme Court Upholds IRS Regulation Saying Medical Residents are "Students" and Subject to FICA Tax|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=November 5, 2011|publisher=Council on Law in Higher Education|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62yOBp3XR|archivedate=November 5, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> clearly stating that it was doing so to "overturn court rulings that had upheld the view that residents remained students".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/01/court-medical-residents-not-students/|title=Court: Medical residents not students|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Lower court proceedings and arguments before the Supreme Court==
The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] to overturn those regulations. The [[United States district court|district court]]s agreed with them, but upon appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, [[Remand (court procedure)|remanding]] the cases for entry of judgments in favor of the United States.<ref name="Am J. Trial Advoc.">{{cite journal|last=La Fleur|first=Zachary|title=Are Medical Residents Classified as Full-Time or Student Employees Under FICA and IRS Regulations?|journal=American Journal of Trial Advocacy|volume=34|year=2010|page=233}}</ref> This decision was at odds with decisions from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5871dd3c-df68-481e-b7b5-e53a0ddec3c6|title=Supreme Court to hear several cases affecting labor & employment|date=July 19, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2011|author=Winston & Strawn LLP|publisher=Lexology|quote=In Mayo, the Eighth Circuit held that the IRS regulation exempting residents was a permissible interpretation of FICA.

Trial Advoc." />

Mayo and Minnesota, supported by [[amicus brief]]s from a number of residency programs and medical organizations, argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature. They asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on academic criteria and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine. They also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work, but also an educational curriculum, conferences, and lectures, much like clinical years of medical school.<ref name="NEJM1" /> Mayo's attorney, former [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]],<ref name="AP" /> also argued that the rule was "arbitrary", as the tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week. The medical schools proposed that the IRS should base their determination on the primary purpose of a program—providing an education versus providing a livelihood.<ref name="WSJ1" />

In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General [[Matthew D. Roberts]] argued on behalf of the United States<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/11/08/court_seems_divided_on_taxing_medical_residents/|newspaper=Boston Globe|title=Court seems divided on taxing medical residents|agency=Associated Press|last=Holland|first=Jesse J.|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wbbQvcDS|archivedate=February 18, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> that patient care and not educational curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted [[Internship (medicine)|interns]], residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits.<ref name="NEJM1" />

During oral arguments, Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] noted that the case was a "very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," and that the only way that one could draw a line between the two "is to have somebody say: This is going to be the line." He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] should be the one. Associate Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?" According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', Associate Justice [[Samuel Alito]] appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?"<ref name="WSJ1">{{cite news|last1=Vaughan|first1=Martin|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|title=Justices Reluctant to Let Medical Residents Skip Taxes |date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602661426355290.html}}</ref>

==Opinion of the Court==
In a decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision.<ref name="AP">{{cite news|title=Supreme Court says medical residents are considered employees for Social Security tax purposes|agency=Associated Press |last=Holland |first=Jesse J. |newspaper=Star Tribune |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/113273014.html|date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w4vHOJ4g |archivedate=January 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Associate Justice [[Elena Kagan]] recused herself from participating in the case, as she had had signed the government's brief during her tenure as [[Solicitor General of the United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/12/supreme_court_says_medical_residents_not_students_for_tax_purposes |title=Medical Residents Ruled Employees |publisher=''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' |last1=Stripling |first1=Jack |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> Declining to review using a standard set out in ''[[National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States]]'' (1979), the Court instead used a standard set out in ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' (1984).<ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /> ''Chevron'', a landmark case regarding deference to government agencies, instituted a two-part test: The job of the reviewing court is to first establish whether Congress has unambiguously spoken about the matter. If so, the court is to follow Congress' intent. If not, it is the job of the court to determine whether the agency's statutory interpretation was a reasonable one.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|vol=467|reporter=U.S.|opinion=837|court=S. Ct.|pinpoint=842–843|date=1984}}</ref> ''National Muffler'', on the other hand, requires that reviewing courts take into account "whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose" and states that courts may examine a statutory interpretation made years after the passage of the original act on the merits.<ref group="note" name="NatMuf" /> The Mayo Foundation had requested that the Court rule according to the ''National Muffler'' standard, while the United States argued that the Court should use the ''Chevron'' standard, arguing that ''National Muffler'' had been superseded. The Court had in fact cited both cases in opinions since 1984, but agreed with the Government's position, stating that it would not be wise to "carve out an approach to administrative review good for tax law only".<ref name="Mayo Part II">{{cite court|litigants=Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States|vol=562|reporter=U.S.|opinion=___|date=2011|pinpoint=Part II|court=S. Ct.}}</ref>

Despite the Mayo Foundation's arguments otherwise, the Court ruled that "student" was a sufficiently ambiguous term to state that Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable.<ref name="Mayo Part II" /> Therefore, according to ''Chevron'', the role of the courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that.<ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /> In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that "The [Treasury] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high {{sic}} skilled professionals, and typically share some or all of the terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".<ref name="AP" />

==Impact==
The Mayo Clinic noted that it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them to pay [[back taxes]].<ref name="WSJ2">{{cite news|last1=Kendall|first1=Brent|last2=Vaughan|first2=Martin|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|title=Tax on Medical Residents Upheld by Court|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2011|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703791904576075802993814720.html}}</ref> In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury announced that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 million annually,<ref name="Chronicle1">{{cite news|title=Medical Schools Must Pay Social Security Taxes for Residents, Supreme Court Rules|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Medical-Residents-Are-Subject/125916/|first=Eric|last=Kelderman|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> or $3,100 a year for a resident earning $50,000 a year.<ref name="WSJ2" />

An article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' noted that "[r]esidents could find additional support in the Court's unambiguous holding for efforts to enforce other workplace rights, such as unemployment benefits (e.g., after hospital closure) or protection under the [[Family Medical Leave Act]]."<ref name="NEJM1" />

The Supreme Court's decision to use ''Chevron'' as its test for reviewing the Treasury Department's decision for marked a departure from previous practice; the Court had the courts have previously given less deference to the Internal Revenue Service's statutory interpretations.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A New Twist to an On-Going Debate About Securities Self-Regulation: It's Time to End FINRA's Federal Income Tax Exemption |first=Kenneth B.|last=Orenbach|journal=Virginia Tax Review|volume=31|page=135|year=2011}}, citing {{cite journal|title=ABA Section on Taxation, Report of the Task Force on Judicial Deference |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=518663 |volume=57|journal=Tax Lawyer|page=717|year=2004 |first1=Ellen P.|last1=Aprill|first2=Linda|last2=Galler|first3=Irving|last3=Salem}}</ref><ref group="note">According to an article in the ''The Federal Circuit Bar Journal'', the Court's application of the ''National Muffler'' standard to "tax regulations promulgated under {{USIRC|7805(a)}}" in the years following ''Chevron'' "created confusion among the lower courts".

A regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent. If the regulation dates from a later period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry. Other relevant considerations are the length of time the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed on it, the consistency of the Commissioner's interpretation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has devoted to the regulation during subsequent re-enactments of the statute." {{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=Martin J., Jr.|last2=Shepard|first2=Ira B.|first3=Daniel L.|last3=Simmons|title=Recent Developments in Federal Income Taxation: The Year 2010 |journal=Florida Tax Review|volume=10|year=2011|page=565}}</ref> However, an article in the ''George Washington Law Review'' which advocates for the use of the ''National Muffler'' standard in reviewing retroactive tax regulations ({{USIRC|7805(b)}}) states that ''National Muffler'' may not have been entirely overruled, arguing that the Court implied that ''Chevron'' test is only to be used in "complex questions of statutory interpretation" and that the Court left open the possibility that a future scenario may warrant the use of the ''National Muffler'' test instead of the ''Chevron'' test.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Andrew|last=Pruitt|journal=George Washington Law Review|title=Judicial Deference to Retroactive Interpretative Treasury Regulations|url=http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Pruitt.pdf|volume=79|year=2011|page=1558|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61zgK8EVG|archivedate=September 26, 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Court also overruled ''[[Rowan Cos. v. United States]]'' (1981), and ''[[United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.]]'' (1982), stating that the ''Chevron'' test does not depend on whether Congress intended to delegate out general authority over a matter or just specific authority.<ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /><ref name="Mayo Part II" />
