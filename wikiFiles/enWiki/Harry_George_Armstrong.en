'''Harry George Armstrong''' (February 17, 1899 – February 5, 1983), known as "the father of [[space medicine]]",<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/AA/siarz.html TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was a [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] in the [[United States Air Force]], a physician, and an airman. Armstrong served in the Marines during [[World War I]] and the Army and Air Force from 1930 to 1957.

He attended the [[University of Minnesota]], but left after one year to enlist in the [[US Marine Corps]], serving with them as a private from October 1918 to March 1919. He then entered the [[University of South Dakota]], graduating in 1921. In 1925 he received his Doctor of Medicine Degree from the [[University of Louisville]]. He entered the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Medical Corps Reserve]] in April 1925. Armstrong entered the School of Aviation Medicine at [[Brooks Field, Texas]], that September. Upon graduation in 1930, he was commissioned a [[US First Lieutenant|first lieutenant]] in the Regular Army Medical Corps. In 1931, he was attached to the Air Corps and assigned as assistant surgeon. He was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] in 1932, to [[Major (United States)]] in 1938, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] (temporary) in February 1942, and to [[colonel]] (temporary) in August 1942. Serving alternately in England and the United States, in 1945 he became surgeon for the Air Division in the office of Military Government for Germany (U.S.), with headquarters in Berlin. In 1946, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel (permanent), returned to the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field upon appointment as Assistant Commandant, and that July was named Commandant.
