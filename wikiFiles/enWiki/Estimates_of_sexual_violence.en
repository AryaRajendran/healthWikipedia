Surveys of victims of crime have been undertaken in many cities and countries, using a common [[methodology]] to aid comparability, and have generally included questions on sexual violence. The [[United Nations]] has conducted extensive surveys to determine the level of sexual violence in different societies. According to these studies, the percentage of women reporting having been a victim of sexual assault ranges from less than 2% in places such as [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (1.4%), [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]] (0.8%), [[Beijing]], [[China]] (1.6%), and [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] (0.3%), to 5% or more in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (6.0%), [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] (5.8%), [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] (8.0%), and [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]] (5.0%).<ref>The international crime victim survey in countries in transition: national reports. Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998.</ref><ref>Victims of crime in the developing world. Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998</ref>

No distinction has been made in these figures between rape by strangers and that by intimate partners. Surveys that fail to make this distinction or those that only examine rape by strangers usually underestimate substantially the prevalence of sexual violence.<ref name="ReferenceA">Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).</ref>

Apart from crime surveys, there have been a small number of surveys, with representative samples, that have asked women about sexual violence. For instance, in a national survey conducted in the [[United States of America]], 14.8% of women over 17 years of age reported having been raped in their lifetime (with an additional 2.8% having experienced [[attempted rape]]) and 0.3% of the sample reported having been raped in the previous year.<ref>Tjaden P, Thoennes N. Full report of the prevalence, incidence and consequences of violence against women: findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Washington, DC, National Institute
of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).</ref> A survey of a representative sample of women aged 18– 49 years in three provinces of South Africa found that in the previous year 1.3% of women had been forced, physically or by means of verbal threats, to have non-consensual sex.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In a survey of a representative sample of the general population over 15 years of age in the [[Czech Republic]] <ref>Weiss P, Zverina J. Experiences with sexual aggression within the general population in the Czech Republic. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 1999,</ref> 28:265–269, 11.6% of women reported forced sexual contact in their lifetime, 3.4% reporting that this had occurred more than once. The most common form of contact was forced vaginal intercourse.

==Sexual violence by intimate partners==
{{main| Sexual violence by intimate partners}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}

===Forced sexual initiation===
A growing number of studies, particularly from [[sub-Saharan Africa]], indicate that the first sexual experience of girls is sometimes unwanted and forced. In a case control study, for example, of 191 [[adolescent]] girls (mean age 16.3 years) attending an [[antenatal]] clinic in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and 353 non [[pregnant]] adolescents matched for age and neighborhood
or school, 31.9% of the study cases and 18.1% of the controls reported that force was used during their sexual initiation. When asked about the consequences of refusing sex, 77.9% of the study cases and 72.1% of the controls said that they feared being beaten if they refused to have sex.<ref>Jewkes R et al. Relationship dynamics and adolescent pregnancy in South Africa. Social Science and Medicine, 2001, 5:733–744.</ref>

Forced sexual initiation and coercion during adolescence have been reported in many studies of young women and men. Where studies have included both men and women in the sample, the prevalence of reported rape or sexual coercion has been higher among the women than the men.<ref>Matasha E et al. Sexual and reproductive health among primary and secondary school pupils in Mwanza, Tanzania: need for intervention. AIDS Care, 1998, 10:571–582.</ref><ref>Buga GA, Amoko DH, Ncayiyana DJ.

A portrait of adolescent health in the Caribbean, 2000. Minneapolis,
MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.</ref> In [[Lima]], [[Peru]], the percentage of young women reporting forced sexual initiation was almost four times that reported by the young men (40% against 11%, respectively).<ref>Caceres CF, Vanoss M, Sid Hudes E. Sexual coercion among youth and young adolescents in Lima, Peru. Journal of Adolescent Health, 2000, 27:361–367.</ref>

===Gang rape===
{{main|Gang rape}}
Gang rape, or mass rape, occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving at least two or more perpetrators is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world.

===Sexual trafficking===
{{Main|Human trafficking}}

Each year hundreds of thousands of women and girls throughout the world are bought and sold into [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].<ref name="Migration Information Programme 1995">Migration Information Programme. Trafficking and prostitution: the growing exploitation of migrant women from central and eastern Europe. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 1995.</ref><ref>Chauzy JP.

London, Virago Press, 2001.</ref> Internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are [[Thailand]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United States|US]], according to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]].<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm]</ref>

Research in [[Kyrgyzstan]] has estimated that around 4,000 people were trafficked from the country in 1999, with the principal destinations being [[China]], [[Germany]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Of those trafficked, 62% reported being forced to work without pay, while over 50% reported being physically abused or tortured by their employers.<ref>Chauzy JP. Kyrgyzstan Republic: trafficking. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 20 January 2001 (Press briefing notes).</ref>

A World Organization against Torture (OMCT) report suggested that more than 200,000 [[Bangladesh| Bangladeshi women]] had been trafficked between 1990 and 1997.<ref>Benninger-Budel C et al. Violence against women: a
report. Geneva, World Organization Against Torture, 1999.</ref> Over 200,000 [[Nepal]]i girls have been trafficked to red light areas of [[India]],<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/15/content_10821971.htm]</ref> and trafficking of [[Thai people|Thai]] women to [[Japan]] has also been reported.<ref name="Dinan K 2000"/> Trafficking of women also takes place internally within some countries, often from rural areas to cities.

In recent years, the problem of human trafficking has gotten very serious in [[Europe]], where women from [[Eastern Europe]], as well as from [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] are trafficked to [[Western Europe]]. In [[Netherlands]], it is estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented.
<ref>[http://english.bnrm.nl/search.aspx?simpleSearch=report]</ref>
<ref>[http://english.bnrm.nl/reports/third/index.aspx]</ref>
<ref>[http://english.bnrm.nl/reports/fourth/index.aspx]</ref> In 2008, there were 809 registered trafficking victims, 763 were women and at least 60 percent of them were forced to work in the [[sex industry]]. All victims from Hungary were female and were forced into prostitution.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Increase-in-human-trafficking-in-Netherlands_49349.html]</ref>
<ref>[http://crossroadsmag.eu/2009/02/dutch-authorities-register-809-human-trafficking-victims/]</ref>
Out of all [[Amsterdam]]'s 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes, more than 75% are from [[Eastern Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade in Amsterdam, in 2008.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5400641.ece Timesonline.co.uk]</ref> An article in ''Le Monde'' in 1997 found that 80% of prostitutes in the Netherlands were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.<ref>[http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm]</ref><ref>[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Netherlands.htm]</ref> In [[Germany]], the trafficking of women from [[Eastern Europe]] is often organized by people from that same region. The German Federal Police Office [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside of Germany.<ref name=bka>[http://www.bka.de/lageberichte/mh.html Reports on human trafficking], by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]]. {{de icon}}</ref>

[[North America]] is also an important destination for international trafficking. A study undertaken under the auspices of the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] estimated that 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually to the United States.<ref name="Richard AO 1999">Richard AO. International trafficking in women to the United States: a contemporary manifestation of slavery and organized crime. Washington, DC, Center for the Study of Intelligence, 1999.</ref> Over 150 cases of trafficking were prosecuted between 1996 and 1999 by the [[United States Department of Justice]].<ref name="Richard AO 1999"/> In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimated that 600-800 persons are trafficked into Canada annually and that additional 1,500-2,200 persons are trafficked through Canada into the United States.<ref>[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Canada.htm Human Trafficking & Modern-day Slavery - Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
In Canada, foreign trafficking for prostitution is estimated to be worth $400 million annually.<ref>[http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html Women & The Economy - Globalization & Migration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Sexual violence against sex workers===
Whether trafficked or not, [[sex workers]] are at high risk for both physical and sexual violence, particularly where sex work is illegal.<ref>Barnard M. Violence and vulnerability: conditions of work for streetworking prostitutes. Sociology of Health and Illness, 1993, 15:683–705.</ref> A survey of female sex workers in [[Leeds]], England, and [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape.<ref>Church S et al. Violence by clients towards female prostitutes in different work settings: questionnaire survey.British Medical Journal, 2001, 322:524–525.</ref> Only 34% of those who had suffered violence at the hands of a client reported it to police.

A survey of sex workers in Bangladesh revealed that 49% of the women had been raped and 59% beaten by police in the previous year; the men reported much lower levels of violence.<ref>Jenkins C. Street sex workers in Dhaka: their clients and enemies. In:The Proceedings of the International Conference on Violence Against Women and Children, Dhaka, Bangladesh, June 1998. Dhaka, 1998.</ref> In [[Ethiopia]], a study of sex workers also found high rates of physical and sexual violence from clients, especially against the child sex workers.<ref>Ayalew T, Berhane Y. Child prostitution: magnitude and related problems. Ethiopian Medical Journal, 2000, 38:153–163.</ref>

==Sexual violence in schools, health care settings, armed conflicts and refugee settings==
===Schools===
For many young women, the most common place where sexual coercion and harassment are experienced is in school. In an extreme case of violence in 1991, 71 teenage girls were raped by their classmates and 19 others were killed at a boarding school in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]], [[Kenya]].<ref>Perlez J. For the oppressed sex: brave words to live by. New York Times, 6 June 1990.</ref> While much of the research in this field comes from Africa, it is not clear whether this reflects a particularly high prevalence of the problem or simply the fact that the problem has had a greater visibility there than in other parts of the world.

Harassment of girls by boys is in all likelihood a global problem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In Canada, for example, 23% of girls had experienced sexual harassment while attending school.<ref>Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L. Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors in adolescent women in Canada. Adolescence, 1997, 32:361–366.</ref>

The research done in Africa, however, has highlighted the role of teachers there in facilitating or perpetrating sexual coercion. A report by Africa Rights <ref>Omaar R, de Waal A. Crimes without punishment: sexual harassment and violence against female students in schools and universities in Africa. African Rights, July 1994 (Discussion Paper No. 4).</ref> found cases of schoolteachers attempting to gain sex, in return for good grades or for not failing pupils, in the Democratic [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. A recent national survey in [[South Africa]] that included questions about experience of rape before the age of 15 years found that schoolteachers were responsible for 32% of disclosed child rapes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In [[Zimbabwe]], a retrospective study of reported cases of child sexual abuse over an 8-year period (1990 to 1997) found high rates of sexual abuse committed by teachers in rural primary schools. Many of the victims were girls between 11 and 13 years of age and penetrative sex was the most prevalent type of sexual abuse.<ref>Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L. Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors inadolescent women in Canada. Adolescence, 1997,
32:361–366.</ref>

===Health care settings===
Sexual violence against patients in health facilities has been reported in many places.<ref>Fary T, Fisher N. Sexual contact between doctors and patients: almost always harmful. British Medical Journal, 1992, 304:1519–1520.</ref><ref>Lamont JA, Woodward C. Patient–physician sexual involvement: a Canadian survey of obstetriciangynecologists.

Policy, 1998.</ref> A study of physicians disciplined for sexual offences in the [[United States]], for instance, found that the number of cases had increased from 42 in 1989 to 147 in 1996, with the proportion of all disciplinary action that was sex-related rising from 2.1% to 4.4% over the same period.<ref>Dehlendorf CE, Wolfe SM. Physicians disciplined for sex-related offenses. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:1883–1888</ref> This increase, though, could reflect a greater readiness to lodge complaints.

Other documented forms of sexual violence against female patients include the involvement of medical staff in the practice of [[clitoridectomy]] in Egypt,<ref>Fayad M. Female genital mutilation (female circumcision). Cairo, Star Press, 2000.</ref> forced [[gynecological]] examinations and the threat of forced abortions in China,<ref>Human rights are women’s rights.

===Armed conflicts and refugee settings===
{{main|War rape}}
Rape has been used as a strategy in many conflicts, including in [[Korea]] during the [[Second World War]] and in [[Bangladesh]] during the war of independence, as well as in a range of armed conflicts such as those in [[Algeria]],<ref>Chelala C. Algerian abortion controversy highlights rape of war victims. Lancet, 1998, 351:1413.</ref> [[Kashmir|India (Kashmir)]],<ref>Asia Watch. Rape in  Kashmir: a crime of war.

Rape as a crime of war: a medical perspective. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1993, 270:612–615.</ref> In some armed conflicts, for example, the ones in Rwanda and the states of the former [[Yugoslavia]] rape has been used as a deliberate strategy to subvert community bonds and thus the perceived enemy, and furthermore as a tool of ethnic cleansing.

In [[East Timor]], there were reports of extensive sexual violence against women by the Indonesian military.<ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000">Pacific Women Against Violence. Violence against East Timor women. Pacific Women’s Network Against Violence Against Women, 2000, 5:1–3.</ref> A study in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]], found that women under 25 years were more likely than those aged 25 years and over to report experiencing attempted rape and sexual coercion during the conflict (18% compared with 4%).<ref>Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the
Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.</ref> Women who were forced to cook for a warring faction were at significantly higher risk.

Another inevitable consequence of armed conflicts is the ensuing economic and social disruption which can force large numbers of people into prostitution,<ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"/> an observation that applies equally to the situation of refugees, whether they are fleeing armed conflicts or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or powerful storms.

Refugees fleeing conflicts and other threatening conditions are often at risk of rape in their new setting. Data from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], for instance, indicated that among the boat people who fled [[Vietnam]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 39% of the women were abducted or raped by pirates while at sea, a figure that is likely to be an underestimate.<ref>Mollica RF, Son L. Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 1989, 12:363–379.</ref>

In many refugee camps as well, including those in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, rape has been found to be a major problem.<ref>Morrell R, ed. Changing men in Southern Africa.

==Customary forms of sexual violence==
===Child marriage===
{{main| Child marriage}}
Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice is legal in many countries and is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex
before they are married. They therefore frequently fear it<ref>George A. Sexual behavior and sexual negotiation among poor women and men in Mumbai: an exploratory study. Baroda, Sahaj Society for Health Alternatives, 1997.</ref> and their first sexual encounters are
often forced.<ref>Sharma V, Sujay R, Sharma A. Can married women say no to sex? Repercussions of the denial of the sexual act.Journal of Family Welfare, 1998, 44:1–8.</ref>

Early marriage is most common in Africa and South Asia, though it also occurs in the Middle East and parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe.<ref name="London 2000">Early marriage: whose right to choose? London, Forum on Marriage and the Rights of Women and Girls, 2000.</ref><ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001">UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.</ref> In [[Ethiopia]] and parts of West Africa, for instance, marriage at the age of 7 or 8 years is not uncommon. In [[Nigeria]], the mean age at first
marriage is 17 years, but in the [[Kebbi State]] of northern [[Nigeria]], the average age at first marriage is just over 11 years.<ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/> High rates of child
marriage have also been reported in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]] and [[Uganda]].<ref name="London 2000"/><ref>100. UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.</ref>

In South Asia, child marriage is especially common in rural areas, but exists also in urban areas.<ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/><ref>Ahmed EM. Violence against women: the legal system and institutional responses. Lahore, AGHS Legal Aid Cell, 1998.</ref><ref>Kumari R, Singh R, Dubey A. Growing up in rural India: problems and needs of adolescent girls. New Delhi, Radiant Publishers, 1990.</ref> In [[Nepal]], the average age at first marriage is 19 years. Seven per cent of girls, though, are married before the age of 10 years, and 40% by the age of 15 years.<ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/> In [[India]], the median age at first marriage for women is 16.4 years. A survey of 5000 women in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]] found that 56% of the women had
married before the age of 15 years, and of these, 17% were married before they were 10 years old. Another survey, conducted in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], found that 14% of girls were married between the ages of 10 and 14 years.<ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/>

Elsewhere, in Latin America for instance, early age at first marriage has been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]].<ref name="London 2000"/><ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/> In North America and Western Europe, less than 5% of marriages involve girls younger than 19 years of age (for example, 1% in [[Canada]],
[[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], 2% in [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]], 3% in [[Spain]], and 4% in the [[United States]].<ref>Indicators on marriage and marital status. In: 1997 Demographic yearbook, 49th ed. New York, NY,
United Nations Statistics Division, 1999.</ref>

===Other customs leading to violence===
In many places, there are customs other than child marriage that result in sexual violence towards women. In [[Zimbabwe]], for instance, there is the custom of ngozi, whereby a girl can be given to a family as compensation for a death of a man caused by a member of the girl's family. On reaching puberty the girl is expected to have sexual intercourse with the brother or father of the deceased person, so as to produce a son to replace the one who died. Another custom is [[chimutsa mapfiwa]] wife inheritance, according to which, when a married woman dies, her sister is obliged to replace her in the matrimonial home.
