The '''biceps femoris''' is a muscle of the posterior (the back) [[thigh]].  As its name implies, it has two parts, one of which (the long head) forms part of the [[hamstring]]s muscle group.

==Anatomy==
===Origin and insertion===
It has two heads of origin;
*one, the ''long head'', arises from the lower and inner impression on the back part of the [[tuberosity of the ischium]], by a tendon common to it and the [[semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and from the lower part of the [[sacrotuberous ligament]];<ref name="Gray's">{{cite web
 |title=Gray's Anatomy |year=1918

}}</ref>
*the other, the ''short head'', arises from the lateral lip of the [[linea aspera]], between the [[adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] and [[vastus lateralis muscle|vastus lateralis]], extending up almost as high as the insertion of the [[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]; from the lateral prolongation of the linea aspera to within 5&nbsp;cm. of the [[Lateral condyle of femur|lateral condyle]]; and from the [[lateral intermuscular septum of thigh|lateral intermuscular septum]].<ref name="Gray's" />

The fibers of the long head form a [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] belly, which passes obliquely downward and lateralward across the [[sciatic nerve]] to end in an [[aponeurosis]] which covers the posterior surface of the muscle, and receives the fibers of the short head; this aponeurosis becomes gradually contracted into a tendon, which is inserted into the lateral side of the head of the [[fibula]], and by a small slip into the lateral condyle of the [[tibia]].<ref name="Gray's" />

At its insertion the tendon divides into two portions, which embrace the [[fibular collateral ligament]] of the [[knee|knee-joint]].<ref name="Gray's" />

From the posterior border of the tendon a thin expansion is given off to the [[fascia]] of the leg. The tendon of insertion of this muscle forms the lateral hamstring; the [[common fibular nerve|common fibular (peroneal) nerve]] descends along its medial border.<ref name="Gray's" />

====Variations====
The short head may be absent; additional heads may arise from the [[tuberosity of the ischium|ischial tuberosity]], the linea aspera, the [[medial supracondylar ridge]] of the femur, or from various other parts.<ref name="Gray's" />

A slip may pass to the [[gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]].<ref name="Gray's" />

===Action===
Both heads of the biceps femoris perform knee flexion.<ref name="Layola">{{MuscleLoyola|bfem}}</ref>

Since the long head originates in the pelvis it is also involved in hip extension.<ref name="Layola" />  The long head of the biceps femoris is a weaker knee flexor when the hip is extended (because of [[active insufficiency]]).  For the same reason the long head is a weaker hip extender when the knee is flexed.

When the knee is semi-flexed, the biceps femoris in consequence of its oblique direction rotates the leg slightly outward.

===Innervation===
The short head of the biceps femoris develops in the [[Posterior compartment of thigh|flexor compartment of the thigh]] and is thus innervated by [[common fibular nerve|common peroneal branch]] of the [[sciatic nerve]] (L5, S2), while the long head is innervated by the [[tibial nerve|tibial branch]] of the sciatic nerve (L5, S2).<ref name="GPnotebook">{{GPnotebook|-865402803}}</ref>

===Blood supply===
The muscle's vascular supply is derived from the [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]] of a several arteries: the [[Perforating arteries|perforating branches]] of the [[profunda femoris artery]], the [[inferior gluteal artery]], and the [[popliteal artery]].<ref name="GPnotebook" />
