{{for|other meanings of '''Amusia'''|Amusia (disambiguation)}}

'''Amusia''' is a [[music-specific disorders|musical disorder]] that appears mainly as a defect in processing [[pitch (music)|pitch]], but it also encompasses musical memory and recognition.<ref>Pearce, J. M. S. (2005). "Selected observations on amusia." [Article]. ''European Neurology'', 54(3), 145-148.</ref> Two main classifications of amusia exist: acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of [[brain damage]], and congenital amusia, which results from a music processing anomaly at birth.

Studies have shown that congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder.<ref name=Insights>Peretz, I., & Hyde, K. L. (2003). "What is specific to music processing? Insights from congenital amusia." [Review]. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 7(8), 362-367.</ref> Acquired amusia, on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing [[speech]],<ref>[http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/article/60 I. Peretz; R. Zatorre, ''Brain organization for music processing.'', Annual Review of Psychology, vol. 56, pp. 89-114 (2005)]</ref> much like [[aphasia|aphasics]] lose speech selectively but can sometimes still [[singing|sing]].<ref>[http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles Hébert, S., Racette, A., Gagnon, L. & Peretz, I.

Current research has demonstrated [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociations]] between [[rhythm]], [[melody]], and emotional processing of music,<ref>Sacks, Oliver. (2007). Musicophilia, New York: Random House. pp. 3-17, 187-258, 302-303.</ref> and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.

==Basics of music processing==
Neurologically intact individuals appear to be born musical. Even before they are able to talk, infants show remarkable musical abilities that are similar to those of adults in that they are sensitive to [[musical scale]]s and a regular [[tempo]].<ref name=Insights/> Also, infants are able to differentiate between [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant and dissonant]] intervals. These perceptual skills indicate that music-specific predispositions exist.<ref name=Insights/>

Prolonged exposure to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training does not seem to be necessary in the processing of [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[key (music)|keys]].<ref name=Insights/> The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular [[pulse (music)|pulse]], both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance.<ref name=Insights/> Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing.<ref name=Insights/> Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]) assign particular importance to notes in the scale and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with amusia, this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.<ref name=Insights/>

Music-specific neural networks exist in the brain for a variety of music-related tasks. It has been shown that [[Broca's area]] is involved in the processing of musical syntax.<ref>Burkhard Maess, Stefan Koelsch, Thomas C. Gunter and Angela D. Friederici. "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area: an MEG study" (2001) ''Nature Publishing Group''.</ref> Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonality|atonal]] music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch.<ref name=Insights/> The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds.<ref name=Insights/> The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system.<ref name=Insights/> Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.<ref name=Insights/>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of amusia are generally categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, sometimes referred to as "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar [[melodies]], the loss of ability to read [[musical notation]], and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes.<ref name=Neuroanatomy>http://amusia-brain.blogspot.com/2008/02/definition_25.html Hutchings, Tiffany, Seth Hayden, Mandy Politziner, and Erina Kainuma. "Amusia." Web log post. Amusia: Definition, Welcome to Amusia..., Congenital and Acquired Amusia, Neural Overview. 25 Feb. 2008. Web. 10 Oct. 2009.</ref> Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write [[musical notation]], and/or play an instrument.<ref>Bautista, R., Ciampetti, M. (2003). Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures. Epilepsia, 44(3), 466-467.</ref> A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.

Clinical symptoms of acquired amusia are much more variable than those of congenital amusia and are determined by the location and nature of the lesion.<ref name=Neuroanatomy/> Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).

Research suggests that patients with amusia also have difficulty when it comes to spatial processing.<ref name=nature>Douglas, K. M., Bilkey, D.K., "Amusia is Associated with Deficits in Spatial Processing." Nature Neuroscience 10, 915-921 (2007)</ref> Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks, while amusics do not.<ref name=nature/> Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations.<ref name=nature/>

Those with congenital amusia show impaired performance on discrimination, identification and imitation of sentences with [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonational]] differences in pitch direction in their final word. This suggests that amusia can in subtle ways impair language processing.<ref>Liu F, Patel AD, Fourcin A, Stewart L. (2010). Intonation processing in congenital amusia: discrimination, identification and imitation. Brain.  133(Pt 6):1682-93. {{doi|10.1093/brain/awq089}} PMID 20418275</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies.<ref name=Diagnosis>Isabelle Peretz, Elvira Brattico, Miika Järvenpa, and Mari Tervaniemi. "The amusic brain: in tune, out of key, and unaware." (March 31, 2009).

==Classifications==
There are two general classifications of amusia: congenital amusia and acquired amusia.

===Congenital amusia===
'''Congenital amusia''', commonly known as [[tone deafness]],<ref name=Family/> refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation,<ref name="Fine-grained"/> and it affects about 4% of the population.<ref name=Insights/> Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions that most people are born with.<ref name=Time>Hyde, K. L., & Peretz, I. (2004). "Brains that are out of tune but in time." [Article]. ''Psychological Science'', 15(5), 356-360.</ref> They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes even though they have normal [[audiometry]] and above average intellectual and memory skills.<ref name=Insights/> Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants.<ref name=Insights/> The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody.<ref name=Insights/> If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.<ref name=Time/>

===Acquired amusia===
'''Acquired amusia''' is a musical disability that shares the same characteristics as congenital amusia, but rather than being inherited, it is the result of brain damage.<ref name= Stroke>Sarkamo, T., Tervaniemi, M., Soinila, S., Autti, T., Silvennoinen, H. M., Laine, M., et al. (2009). "Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study." [Article]. ''Neuropsychologia'', 47(12), 2642-2651.</ref> It is also more common than congenital amusia.<ref name=Stroke/> While it has been suggested that music is processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes.<ref name=Stroke/> A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery.<ref name=Stroke/> The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred.<ref name=Stroke/> Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and over the course of the study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.

Results showed that there was no significant difference in the distribution of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the [[frontal lobe]] and [[auditory cortex]].<ref name=Stroke/> [[Temporal lobe]] lesions were also observed in patients with amusia.  Amusia is a common occurrence following an [[ischemic]] MCA stroke, as evidenced by the 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one week post-stroke stage.<ref name= Stroke/> While significant recovery takes place over time, amusia can persist for long periods of time.<ref name=Stroke/> Test results suggest that acquired amusia and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.<ref name=Stroke/>

==Neuroanatomy==
{{Infobox disease |Name=Music Processing and the Brain |Image= |Alt=A diagram showing the different sections of the brain and how they relate to music processing. |Caption=An image depicting the different sections of the brain and specific areas that relate to music processing in particular.}}

===Overview===
Many research studies of individuals with amusia show that a number of cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the [[primary auditory cortex]], secondary auditory cortex, and [[limbic system]] are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various etiologies of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.<ref name=Neuroanatomy/>

===Pitch relations===
Studies suggest that the analysis of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as [[Pitch contour|contour]] (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information.<ref>Zatorre, R.J., Berlin, P. (2001). Spectral and temporal processing in human auditory cortex. Cerebral Cortex. 11:946-953</ref> The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information.<ref name=Agnosia>Ayotte, J., Peretz, I., Rousseau, I., Bard, C., Bojanowski, M. (2000). Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts. Brain. 123:1926-1938</ref> In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.<ref>Tramo, M., Shah, G.D., Braida, L.D. (2002). Functional role of auditory cortex in frequency processing and pitch perception. Journal of Neurophysiology. 87:122-139.</ref>

===Temporal relations===
The brain analyzes the temporal (rhythmic) components of music in two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping.<ref>Di Pietro, M., Laganaro, M., Leeman, B., Schnider, A. (2004). Receptive amusia: temporal auditory deficit in a processional musician following a left temporo-parietal lesion. Neuropsychologia. 42:868-977.</ref><ref>Wilson, S.J., Pressing, J., Wales, R.J. (2002). Modeling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke. Neuropsychologia. 40:1494-505.</ref> Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production.<ref>Halsband, U., Tanji, J. Feund, H.J. (1993). The role of premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in the temporal control of movement in man. Brain. 116:243-246.</ref> Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.<ref name= Neuroanatomy/>

===Memory===
Memory is required in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation.<ref>Zatorre, R.J., Samson, S. (1991) Role of the right temporal neocortex in retention of pitch in auditory short-term memory. Brain. 114:2403-2417.</ref><ref>Gaab, N., Gaser, C., Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Schlaug, G. (2003). Functional anatomy of pitch memory-an fMRI study with sparse temoral sampling. NeuroLmage. 19:1417-1426.</ref> This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks.<ref name=Stroke/> Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs,<ref name=Agnosia/> and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes.<ref>Zatorre, R.J., Halpern, R. (1993). Effect of unilateral temporal-lobe excision on percention and imagery of songs. Neuropsychologia. 31:221-32.</ref> These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.

===Other regions of the brain possibly linked to amusia===
* Lesions (or the absence of) in associations between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe
* Cortical thickness and reduced [[white matter]] – in a recent study, [[voxel-based morphometry]], an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of amusic individuals as compared to controls.<ref name=Morphometry>Hyde, K. L., Zatorre, R. J., Griffiths, T. D., Lerch, J. P., & Peretz, I. (2006). "Morphometry of the amusic brain: a two-site study." [Article]. ''Brain'', 129, 2562-2570.</ref> Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction.<ref name=Morphometry/> For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined to listen to music than others, which could ultimately cause reduced [[myelination]] of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.<ref name=Morphometry/>
* Involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus (responsible for the emotional reaction to music)<ref name=Neuroanatomy/>

==Discovery==
In 1825, F. Gall mentioned a "musical organ" in a specific region of the human brain that could be spared or disrupted after a traumatic event resulting in brain damage.<ref>[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=000206851. Alossa, Nicoletta; Castelli, Lorys, "Amusia and Musical Functioning", Eur Neurol, Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 269-277 (2009)]</ref> In 1865, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]] described the first series of cases that involved the loss of music abilities that were due to brain injury. Later, during the late nineteenth-century, several influential neurologists studied language in an attempt to construct a [[theory of cognitive development|theory of cognition]]. While not studied as thoroughly as language, music and visual processing were also studied. In 1888-1890, [[August Knoblauch]] produced a cognitive model for music processing and termed it amusia. This model for music processing was the earliest produced.<ref> {{doi|10.1016/S0278-2626(02)00527-4}}. Johnson, Julene; Graziano, Amy, "August Knoblauch and amusia: A Nineteenth-century Cognitive Model of Music", (February 2003)</ref>

==Interesting case studies==
===First documented case of congenital amusia===
While the possibility that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits is not a new notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently.<ref name=Fine-grained/> The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper.<ref name=Fine-grained/> Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years.<ref name=Fine-grained/> Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.

In order to determine if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note.<ref name=Fine-grained/> Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group.<ref name=Fine-grained/> Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music.<ref name=Fine-grained/> Interestingly, a later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.<ref name=Tone-deaf>Foxton, J. M., Dean, J. L., Gee, R., Peretz, I., & Griffiths, T. D. (2004). "Characterization of deficits in pitch perception underlying 'tone deafness'." [Article]. ''Brain'', 127, 801-810.</ref>

This finding led to another test that was designed to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception.<ref name=Fine-grained/> In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was asked to respond "yes" if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond "no" if she could not detect a pitch change.  Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two [[semitone]]s ([[whole tone]]), or half steps.<ref name=Fine-grained/> While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, it does not seem to include speech intonation.<ref name=Fine-grained/> This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music.<ref name= Insights/> In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital amusia.<ref name=Fine-grained/>

===Family aggregation study===
Another interesting question posed about congenital amusia is if it has a genetic origin.<ref name=Family/> A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia.<ref name=Family/> Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group.<ref name=Family/> Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group.<ref name=Family/> This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical.<ref name=Family/> A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.<ref name=Family/>

Overall, test results support the view that congenital amusia is hereditary.<ref name=Family/> It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development.<ref name=Family/> However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched.<ref name=Family/> This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.<ref name=Family/>

===Singing in congenital amusia===
While it is known that congenital amusia is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent study sought to discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing.<ref name=Singing>Bella, S. D., Giguere, J. F., & Peretz, I. (2009). "Singing in congenital amusia." [Article]. ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', 126(1), 414-424.</ref> In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital amusia were poor singers.<ref name=Singing/> They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm.<ref name=Singing/> The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency.<ref name=Singing/> The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.<ref name=Singing/>

It is also interesting to compare the results of singing with the lyrics and singing on the syllable "la". Although most of the amusic subjects struggled with maintaining the correct pitch when singing with lyrics, they were able to complete the task. However, when singing the same song on the syllable "la", more than half of the amusic subjects could only sing a few notes.<ref name=Singing/> This is due to a poor memory of the musical component of songs.<ref name=Singing/> Overall, it was concluded that singing deficiency in amusic individuals might be a result of their pitch perception deficit.<ref name=Singing/> However, the existence of amusic individuals who are able to sing proficiently suggests that there may be separate neural pathways for auditory perception and action.<ref name=Singing/>

{{Main|Music-specific disorders}}

Amusia has recently been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities.<ref name=Congenital>http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/2/238I. Ayotte, Julie; Peretz, Isabelle; Hyde, Krista, ''Congenital Amusia.'', Brain, vol. 125 No. 2, pp. 238-251 (February 2002)</ref> Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to [[dyslexia]] and other similar disorders.<ref>[http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Brain-Patterns-In-Amusia-May-Be-Related-To-Other-Disorders-4751-1/. Peretz, Isabelle; Brattico, Elvira; Tervaniemi, Mari," Abnormal Electrical Brain Responses to Pitch in Congenital Amusia," Annals of Neurology, Vol. 58 (September 2002)]</ref> Research has been shown that amusia may be related to an increase in size of the [[cerebral cortex]], which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and [[epilepsy]] are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.<ref>[http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/27/47/13028. Hyde, Krista; Lerch, Jason; Zatorre, Robert J., "Cortical Thickness in Congenital Amusia: When Less Is Better Than More.'', The Journal of Neuroscience, Vol. 27(47) pp.13028-13032 (November 2007)]</ref>

Amusia is also similar to [[aphasia]] in that they affect similar areas of the [[human brain|brain]] near the [[temporal lobe]]. Most cases of those with amusia do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown that those who have aphasia can exhibit symptoms of amusia, especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other.<ref name=Congenital/> In acquired amusia, inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as [[memory]] and [[learning]], mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.<ref name=Stroke/>

Amusia can also be related to [[aprosody]], a disorder in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely monotonous. It has been found that both amusia and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere.<ref name=aprosody>http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118867217/PDFSTART. Bautista, R.E., Ciampetti, M.Z., "Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures.", Epilepsia, 44(3):466–467, 2003</ref> They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with amusia from injury.<ref name=aprosody/> There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.<ref name=aprosody/>

==Social and emotional impact==
Other than their inability to hear music, which is most likely due to a [[genetic disorder|genetic defect]], the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is on the ability to tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In [[China]] and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact; difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.<ref>[http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf Stewart, Lauren, "Pitch Fever", BBC Music Magazine, pp 36-38, (October 2005)]</ref>

==Treatment==
Currently, no forms of treatment have proven effective in treating amusia. One study has shown tone differentiation techniques to have some success, however future research on treatment of this disorder will be necessary to verify this technique as an appropriate treatment.<ref name=Congenital/>

==Future research==
Over the past decade, much has been discovered about amusia. However, there remains a great deal more to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying.<ref name=Congenital/> However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development.<ref name=Fine-grained/> Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as [[dysphasia]] and dyslexia.<ref name=Music-specific/><ref name=Fine-grained/>
