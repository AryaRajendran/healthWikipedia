'''Plantar fasciitis''' (PF) is a [[pain]]ful [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process of the [[plantar fascia]], the [[connective tissue]] on the [[sole (foot)|sole (bottom surface) of the foot]]. It is often caused by overuse of the plantar fascia or arch tendon of the foot. It is a very common condition and can be difficult to treat if not looked after properly. Another common term for the affliction is "policeman's heel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Plantar-Fasciitis.htm |title=Plantar Fasciitis &#124; Health |publisher=Patient.co.uk |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref> 

Longstanding cases of plantar fasciitis often demonstrate more degenerative changes than inflammatory changes, in which case they are termed '''plantar fasciosis'''.<ref>{{cite pmid| 12756315 }}</ref>  The suffix "osis" implies a [[pathology]] of chronic [[degeneration]] without [[inflammation]].  Since [[tendon]]s and [[ligament]]s do not contain [[blood vessel]]s, they do not actually become inflamed. Instead, injury to the tendon is usually the result of an accumulation over time of microscopic tears at the cellular level.

The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue originating on the bottom surface of the [[calcaneus]] (heel bone) and extending along the sole of the foot towards the [[toe]]s. It has been reported that plantar fasciitis occurs in two million Americans a year and in 10% of the U.S. population over a lifetime.<ref>{{cite pmid| 12728038 }}</ref> It is commonly associated with long periods of [[weight bearing]]. Among non-athletic populations, it is associated with a high [[body mass index]].<ref name="orthopt.org">{{cite journal|title=Heel Pain – Plantar Fasciitis|author=McPoil TG, Martin RL, Cornwall MW, Wukich DK, Irrgang JJ, Godges JJ|journal=J Orthop Sports Phys Ther.|year=2008|volume=38|issue=4|url=http://www.orthopt.org/ICF/Heel%20Pain-Plantar%20Fasciitis%20-%20JOSPT%20-%20%20April%202008.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-06-21|doi=10.2519/jospt.2008.0302}}</ref> The pain is usually felt on the underside of the [[heel]] and is often most intense with the first steps of the day. Another symptom is that the sufferer has difficulty bending the foot so that the toes are brought toward the [[Tibia|shin]] (decreased [[dorsiflexion]] of the [[ankle]]). A symptom commonly recognized among sufferers of plantar fasciitis is an increased probability of [[knee]] pains, especially among [[running|runners]].

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is usually made by clinical examination alone.<ref name=Buchbinder>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMcp032745}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid| 16342847}}</ref> 
The clinical examination may include checking the patient’s feet and watching the patient stand and walk. The clinical examination will take under consideration a patient's medical history, physical activity, foot pain symptoms and more. The doctor may decide to use imaging studies like [[Radiography|radiograph]]s (X-rays), [[Medical ultrasonography|diagnostic ultrasound]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].

[[File:Fasciitis.jpg|180px|thumb|Heel bone with heel spur]]
An incidental finding associated with this condition is a [[heel spur]], a small bony [[calcification]] on the [[calcaneus]] heel bone, in which case it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur; the plantar fasciitis is not caused by the spur.

Sometimes ball-of-foot pain is mistakenly assumed to be derived from plantar fasciitis.  A dull pain or numbness in the [[metatarsal]] region of the foot could instead be [[metatarsalgia]], also called capsulitis. Some current studies suggest that plantar fasciitis is not actually inflamed plantar fascia, but merely an inflamed [[flexor digitorum brevis muscle]] (FDB) belly.  Ultrasound evidence illustrates fluid within the FDB muscle belly, not the plantar fascia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Treatment==

Treatment options for plantar fasciitis include rest, [[massage]] therapy, stretching,<ref>{{cite pmid| 10710257}}</ref> night splints, [[physical therapy]], [[Cold compression therapy|cold therapy]], [[heat therapy]], orthotics, anti-inflammatory medications, injection of [[corticosteroid]]s and surgery in [[Refractory disease|refractory]] cases. Also, in some cases, massaging of the inflamed location serves as a temporary relief.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Physical treatments===

Based on current research, recommendations for immediate relief and reduction of inflammation include heel and foot stretching exercises as can be tolerated, rest, wearing shoes with good support and cushions. Other steps to relieve pain include: applying ice or ice-heat-ice, and/or using night splints to stretch the injured fascia. Customized functional foot orthotics can offer a decrease in the pain associated with plantar fasciitis and may provide an additional benefit in terms of increased functional ability in patients with the condition.<ref name="Uden">{{cite journal |last=Uden |first=H |coauthors=E. Boesch, S. Kumar |title=Plantar fasciitis - to jab or to support? A systematic review of the current best evidence|journal=The Journal of Multidiscipinary Healthcare |volume=4 |issue= |pages=155–164 |year=2011 |pmid=21655342 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104687/}}</ref> According to a clinical practice guideline, "there is no evidence" to support the use of foot orthotics for long-term (1 year) pain management or function improvement.<ref name="orthopt.org"/><ref>{{cite pmid|16801514}}</ref>

Some evidence shows that [[stretching]] of the [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]] and [[plantar fascia]] may provide up to 2–4 months of benefit.<ref name="orthopt.org"/> One study has shown improvement over a four-month period with stretching.<ref>{{cite pmid|10229276}}</ref> One study has shown high success rates with a stretch of the plantar fascia,<ref name="Digiovanni">{{cite journal |last=Digiovanni |first=Benedict F. |coauthors=Deborah A.

Because it is impractical to do [[double-blind experiment]]s involving stretching, such studies are vulnerable to [[placebo effect]]s.  

Pain with the first steps of the day can be markedly reduced by stretching the plantar fascia and [[Achilles tendon]] before getting out of bed. Night [[Splint (medicine)|splints]]<!--correct disambiguation? 091005--> can be used to keep the foot in a dorsi-flexed position during sleep to improve calf muscle flexibility and decrease pain on waking. These have many different designs. The type of splint has not been shown to affect outcomes.

===Medications===
To relieve pain and inflammation, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) such as [[aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]] are often used but are of limited benefit.<ref name="JAPMA1998-Lynch">{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=D. |coauthors=Goforth, W., Martin, J., Odom, R., Preece, C., & Kottor M. |title=Conservative treatment of plantar fasciitis.

Local injection of [[corticosteroid]]s often gives temporary or permanent relief, but may be painful, especially if not combined with a [[local anesthetic]] and injected slowly with a small-diameter needle.<ref name="JointBoneSpine2005-Genc">{{cite journal |last=Genc |first=Hakan |coauthors=Meryem Saracoglu, Bans Nacir, Hatice Rana Erdem and Mahmut Kacar |title=Long-term ultrasonographic follow-up of plantar fasciitis patients treated with steroid injection |journal=''Joint Bone'' spine |year=2005 |pages=61–5 |volume=72 |issue=1 |pmid=15681250 |doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2004.03.006}}</ref> Recurrence rates may be lower if injection is performed under [[ultrasound]] guidance.<ref name="JClinUltrasound2006-Tsai">{{cite journal |last=Tsai |first=Wen-Chung |coauthors=Chih-Chin Hsu, Carl P.

While this may actually improve pain initially, it has deleterious long-term consequences.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Surgery===
Surgery carries the risk of nerve injury, infection, rupture of the plantar fascia, and failure to improve the pain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007021.htm |work=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=National Institutes of Health |title=Plantar fasciitis |last=Kauffman |first=Jeffrey |date=2006-09-21 }}</ref> Traditional surgical procedures, such as plantar fascia release, are a last resort, and often lead to further complications such as a lowering of the arch and pain in the supero-lateral side of the foot due to compression of the [[cuboid bone]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} This will allow decompression of the nearby FDB muscle belly that is inflamed, yet does not fix the underlying problem.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  This allows more space for the inflamed muscle belly, thus, relieving pain/pressure.<ref>{{cite web |title=Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomies / Heel Pain.

A needle is inserted into the plantar fascia and moved back and forwards to disrupt the fibrous tissue.<ref>{{cite web |title=Treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis by sonographically-guided needle fasciotomy |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B7586-4HDGBTN-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=15470e390a9ddce32209aada20c62c9b |publisher=Am College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons }}</ref>

Coblation surgery (aka Topaz procedure) has been used successfully in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. This procedure utilizes radiofrequency ablation and is a minimally invasive procedure.<ref>{{cite pmid|21354000}}</ref>

===Extracorporeal shockwave therapy===
There is contradictory evidence and recommendations for the efficacy of [[extracorporeal shockwave therapy]] (ESWT), or the use of [[acoustics|acoustic]] [[shock waves]], as treatment for plantar fasciitis.  One review found that the preponderance of evidence supports the use of ESWT, but only after several months of treatment with more accepted and proven therapies have failed, as a possible alternative to surgical intervention.<ref name=Rompe>{{cite journal |author=Rompe JD, Furia J, Weil L, Maffulli N |title=Shock wave therapy for chronic plantar fasciopathy |journal=Br.
