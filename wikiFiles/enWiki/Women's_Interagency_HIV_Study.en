The '''Women's Interagency [[HIV]] Study (WIHS)''' is a longitudinal, observational [[cohort study]] of women infected with and at risk for HIV infection in the United States.

==Funding==
The WIHS is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ (NIAID)] with supplemental funding from the National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/ (NCI)], and the National Institute on Drug Abuse [http://www.nida.nih.gov/ (NIDA)]. Funding is also provided by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/ (NICHD)] and the National Center for Research Resources [http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/ (NCRR)].

==Clinical sites==
WIHS clinical sites are located in and around 6 cities in the US: Bronx, NY; Brooklyn, NY; Washington, DC; Los Angeles, CA; San Francisco, CA; and Chicago, IL.  The data management and coordinating center is in Baltimore, MD.  Each consortium is headed by a principal investigator, is affiliated with local research institutes to see study participants, and has its own [https://statepiaps.jhsph.edu/wihs/index-ncab.htm Community Advisory Board].

==Recruitment==
The study consist of a [[cohort study|cohort]] of [[HIV positive]] and HIV negative [[women]] being studied over a long term since 1994.  This study is now over 13 years old as of 2007.  An additional cohort of women were added in 2001 included some women who had taken [[HAART]], the anti-HIV [[drug]] [[regimen]].  [[HIV]] stands for the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]], the [[retrovirus]] considered by almost all scientists to be the cause of [[AIDS]], or [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]].  HAART stands for [[Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy]].

There is some evidence that women with HIV have more frequent conditions (or higher [[morbidity]]) of such [[infectious diseases]] as [[yeast infections]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], and [[herpes]]. <ref>
[http://www.inova.org/inovapublic.srt/juniper/wihs.jsp Higher morbidity for certain infections]</ref>  It is not known, for certain, whether HIV infection causes higher [[death|mortality]] for these diseases, but this may be presumed.
