A '''charley horse''' is a popular [[North American English|North American]] [[colloquial]] term for painful spasms or [[Cramp#Skeletal muscle cramps|cramp]]s in the [[Human leg#Muscles|leg muscle]]s, typically lasting anywhere from a few seconds to about a day. It can also refer to a bruise on an arm or leg and a bruising of the [[quadriceps]] muscle of the anterior or lateral thigh, or [[contusion]] of the femur, that commonly results in a [[hematoma]] and sometimes several weeks of pain and disability. Such an injury is known in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and many Commonwealth countries as a '''dead leg''', '''gunt''', or '''chopper'''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/health_and_fitness/4284462.stm ''What is a dead leg?''], bbc.co.uk.</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/COWBOYS+FIVE+YEARS+RUNNING-a094099379 ''Cowboys five years running 2002''], LA Daily News (archived article)</ref> In [[Australia]] it is also known as a [[Hematoma#Sport_injuries|corked thigh]] or "corky."<ref>[http://www.mydr.com.au/sports-fitness/corked-thigh ''corked thigh''], mydr.com.au</ref> It often occurs in [[contact sport]]s, such as football when an athlete suffers a knee (blunt trauma) to the lateral quadriceps causing a hematoma or temporary paresis and antalgic gait as a result of pain.

Another nuance for the term "charley horse" is used to describe simple painful muscle [[cramp]]s in the leg or foot, especially those that follow strenuous exercise.<ref>[http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/two/000019860.htm ''Dorland's Medical Dictionary'' entry for "charley horse"]</ref><ref name="World Wide Words: Charley Horse">[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cha1.htm World Wide Words: Charley Horse].</ref> These muscle cramps can have many possible causes directly resulting from high or low pH or substrate concentrations in the blood, including [[hormonal imbalance]]s, low levels of [[potassium]] or [[calcium]], side effects of medication, or, more seriously, diseases such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[neuropathy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller TM, Layzer RB |title=Muscle cramps |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=431–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15902691 |doi=10.1002/mus.20341}}</ref> They are also a common complaint during [[pregnancy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Young GL, Jewell D |editor1-last=Henderson |editor1-first=Sonja |title=Interventions for leg cramps in pregnancy |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD000121 |year=2002 |pmid=11869565 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000121}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Relief is usually given by either massaging or stretching the foot, ankle or knee in the opposite direction of the spasm.

Colloquial advice suggests that dietary deficiency of potassium, found richly in bananas and many vegetables,<ref>http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=90</ref> is a common cause of these spasms.

==Etymology==

The term may date back to American [[slang]] of the 1880s, possibly from the [[pitcher]] [[Charles Radbourn|Charlie "Old Hoss" Radbourn]] who is said to have suffered from cramps.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34344 |title=Charley horse definition |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=MedicineNet}}</ref> 

In Norway, it is referred to as a '''lårhøne''' (thigh hen), in Sweden '''lårkaka''' (thigh cookie), and in France as a '''crampe''' (cramp) or '''claquage''' (if the muscle is torn). In Portugal, it is known as a '''paralítica''', roughly translated to "paralyzer". In [[Brazil]] it has become known as "tostão" or "paulistinha". In Japan it is known as {{nihongo|''komuragaeri''|こむら返り|}}, which is literally "cramp in the [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]]". In northeastern Italy, it is commonly called a '''lopez''', while in the northwest it is called '''vecchia''' (old woman) or '''dura''' ("hard one" or "tough one"); in the south of the country, instead, it is called '''morso del ciuccio''' (donkey's bite). In some areas of central Italy, it is called '''[[water buffalo]]'''. In Israel it is called '''Regel Etz''' which means wooden leg. It is called '''chaca''' (rat) in the [[Chamorro language]] of Guam and the Mariana Islands. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.
