'''Heiko Braak''' (born June 16, 1937) is a [[Germany|German]] [[anatomist]]. Braak was born in [[Kiel]], [[Schleswig-Holstein Province|Schleswig-Holstein]], and studied [[medicine]] at the universities of [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]], and Kiel. He is [[Professor]] at the Institute of Clinical Neuroanatomy, [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University]], [[Frankfurt am Main]].

Braak’s early research focused on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[central nervous system]] of [[chondrichthyan]] fishes. In the [[Holocephali|holocephalan]] species ''Chimaera monstrosa'' (ratfish), he described, in the basal midline of the [[diencephalon]], a previously unknown [[ependymal]] structure adjacent to the rostral part of the [[optic chiasma]] referred to as the ‘organon vasculare praeopticum’.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Braak | first1 = H. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1963 | title = Das Ependym der Hirnventrikel von ''Chimaera monstrosa'' (mit besonderer Berücksichtigung des Organon vasculare praeopticum) | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 582–608 | doi = 10.1007/BF00331185 }}</ref> It may be considered [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the [[Organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis|supraoptic crest]] of [[mammals]].<ref>Kuhlenbeck H. (1977). ''The central nervous system of vertebrates.'' Vol. 5, Part I, p. 89. Karger, Basel.</ref> Braak also described the morphology of the [[Posterior pituitary|neurohypophysial]] complex of the [[squaliform]] [[elasmobranch]] ''[[Etmopterus spinax]]'' (''Spinax niger'').<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Braak | first1 = H. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1962 | title = Über die Gestalt des neurosekretorischen Zwischenhirn-Hypophysen-Systems von ''Spinax niger'' | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 265–276 | doi = 10.1007/BF00320188 }}</ref>

Braak’s further research has focused on the morphology and pathoanatomy of the human central nervous system, in particular of the [[cerebral cortex]] (1980).    

Braak has also contributed extensively to the neuropathology of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. In particular, he introduced a classification of Alzheimer’s disease into six distinct pathoanatomical stages, now commonly referred to as Braak stages, based on the topographical distribution pattern of neurofibrillary changes from circumscribed parts of the [[limbic system]] to the higher [[neocortex|neocortical]] association fields.*<ref>{{cite journal | author=Braak H, Braak E | title=Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes | journal=Acta Neuropathologica  | volume=82 | issue=4 | year=1991 | pages=239–259 | pmid =1759558 | doi=10.1007/BF00308809 }}</ref> A similar classification was proposed in 2003 for the pathoanatomical changes associated with [[idiopathic]] Parkinson's disease.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Braak | first1 = H. | last2 = Del Tredici | first2 = K. | last3 = Rüb | first3 = U | last4 = de Vos | first4 = R.A.I ''et al.'' | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2004 | title = Staging of brain pathology related to sporadic Parkinson's disease | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 197–211 }}</ref>

Braak was the first to describe the pathological changes of [[argyrophilic grain disease]], a previously unknown form of senile [[dementia]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Braak | first1 = H. | last2 = Braak | first2 = E. | year = 1987 | title = Argyrophilic grains: characteristic pathology of cerebral cortex in cases of adult onset dementia without Alzheimer changes | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 76 | issue = 1| pages = 124–127 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3940(87)90204-7 | pmid = 2438598 }}</ref>

Recently, Braak and co-authors advanced a ‘dual-hit [[hypothesis]]’ about the [[pathogenesis]] of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, according to which an unknown pathogen akin to a slow-virus may enter the nervous system through both the nasal and [[intestinal]] [[mucosae]], eventually resulting in a cascade of neurodegenerative events in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = C.H. | last2 = Del Tredici | first2 = K. | last3 = Braak | first3 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Review: Parkinson's disease: a dual-hit hypothesis | url = | journal = Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 599–614 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00874.x | pmid = 17961138 }}</ref>

Braak is the son of the [[philologist]] Professor [[Ivo Braak]] (1906–1991) and brother of theatre director Dr. [[Kai Braak]].
