The '''palmomental reflex''' (PMR) is a [[Primitive reflexes|primitive reflex]] consisting of a twitch of the chin muscle elicited by stroking a specific part of the palm. It is present in infancy and disappears as the brain matures during childhood but may reappear due to processes that disrupt the normal [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] inhibitory pathways. Therefore it is an example of a [[frontal release sign]].

==Research==
Marinesco and Radovici in their seminal paper hypothesize that both the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] (receptive) and [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] (motor) arms of the [[reflex]] are on the same side (ipsilateral) to the hand stimulated;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marinesco G, Radovici A|title=Sur un reflexe cutane nouveau: reflexe palmo-mentonnier|journal=Rev Neurol|year=1920|volume=27|pages=237–40}}</ref> however this hypothesis remains unsubstantiated.<ref name=owen>{{cite journal |author=Owen G, Mulley GP |title=The palmomental reflex: a useful clinical sign? |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=113–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12122165 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.73.2.113 |pmc=1738000}}</ref>

The PMR has been found to be present more frequently in various [[neurological]] conditions both localized and diffuse. These include [[congenital]] conditions such as [[Down's syndrome]] where it is unclear whether the reflex persists throughout life or disappears and then re-appears in association with the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]] pathology. The reflex is common in the elderly population and should not be taken as indicative of a dementing process.<ref name="owen" />

==Eliciting and observing response==
The [[thenar eminence]] is stroked briskly with a thin stick, from proximal (edge of wrist) to distal (base of thumb) using moderate pressure. A positive response is considered if there is a single visible twitch of the ipsilateral [[mentalis muscle]] (chin muscle on the same side as the hand tested).<ref name="owen"/>

==Localizing value==
A study set in a neurosurgical in-patient population showed there is no significant association between the side of the reflex and the side of the hemispheric lesion in patients with unilateral (one-sided) [[reflexes]] and unilateral (one-sided) lesions.<ref name=gotkine>{{cite journal |author=Gotkine M, Haggiag S, Abramsky O, Biran I |title=Lack of hemispheric localizing value of the palmomental reflex |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=9 |pages=1656 |year=2005 |pmid=15883341 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000160525.50482.C7}}</ref>

[[Primitive reflexes]] such as the PMR were classically viewed as signs of disorders that affect the [[frontal lobe]]s, however this traditional view is questionable as the reflex has been noted for example in cases of one-sided temporal lobe pathology.<ref name="owen"/><ref name=gotkine/>

A presentation at the 19th Meeting of the European Neurological Society suggests a possible link between presence of the PMR with stroke. Patients with the PMR present had a significantly higher incidence of silent ischemic strokes than matched patients who did not have the reflex present.<ref>19th Meeting of the European Neurological Society: Abstract P382.
