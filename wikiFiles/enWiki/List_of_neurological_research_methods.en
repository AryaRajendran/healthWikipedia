There are numerous types of research methods used when conducting neurological research, all with the purpose of trying to view the activity that occurs within the brain during a certain activity or behavior. The disciplines within which these methods are used is quite broad, ranging from [[psychology]] to [[neuroscience]] to [[biomedical engineering]] to [[sociology]]. The following is a list of [[neuroimaging]] methods:

*[[Electroencephalography|Electroencephalography (EEG)]]
:*[[Quantitative electroencephalography|Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG)]]
:*[[Stereoelectroencephalography|Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)]]
*[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]]
*[[Magnetoencephalography|Magnetoencephalography (MEG)]]
*[[Near-infrared spectroscopy|Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)]]
*[[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]]
*[[Single-unit recording]]
*[[Transcranial direct current stimulation|Transcranial direct-current stimulation (TDCS)]]
*[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)]]
