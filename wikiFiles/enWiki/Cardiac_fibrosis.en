'''Cardiac fibrosis''' may refer to an abnormal thickening of the [[heart valves]] due to inappropriate proliferation of cardiac [[fibroblast]]s but more commonly refers to the proliferation of fibroblasts in the cardiac muscle. Fibrotic cardiac muscle is stiffer and less compliant and is seen in the progression to heart failure. The description below focuses on a specific mechanism of valvular pathology but there are other causes of valve pathology and fibrosis of the cardiac muscle.

Fibrocyte cells normally secrete [[collagen]], and function to provide structural support for the heart. When over-activated this process causes thickening and fibrosis of the valve, with white tissue building up primarily on the [[tricuspid valve]], but also occurring on the [[pulmonary valve]]. The thickening and loss of flexibility eventually may lead to valvular dysfunction and right-sided [[heart failure]].

== Connection with excess blood serotonin (5-HT) ==

Certain diseases such as gastrointestinal [[carcinoid]] tumors of the mid-gut, which sometimes release large amounts of 5-hydroxytryptamine, commonly known as 5-HT or [[serotonin]] into the blood, may produce a characteristic pattern of mostly right-sided cardiac fibrosis which can be identified at autopsy. This pathology has also been seen in certain West-African tribes who eat foods ([[Matoke]] —a green banana) containing excess amounts of serotonin.

== Connection with direct serotonergic agonist drugs ==
Elevated prevalence of cardiac fibrosis and related valvopathies was found to be associated with use of a number of unrelated drugs following long-term statistical analysis once the drugs had been on the market for some time. The cause of this was unknown at the time, but eventually it was realised that all the implicated drugs acted as agonists at 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors in the heart in addition to their intended sites of action elsewhere in the body.<ref name="pmid17202454">{{cite journal |author=Zanettini R, Antonini A, Gatto G, Gentile R, Tesei S, Pezzoli G |title=Valvular heart disease and the use of dopamine agonists for Parkinson's disease |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=1 |pages=39–46 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17202454 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa054830 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19170199">{{cite journal |author=Andersohn F, Garbe E |title=Cardiac and noncardiac fibrotic reactions caused by ergot-and nonergot-derived dopamine agonists |journal=Movement Disorders : Official Journal of the Movement Disorder Society |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=129–33 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19170199 |doi=10.1002/mds.22385 |url=}}</ref> The precise mechanisms involved remain elusive however, as while the cardiotoxicity shows some dose-response relationship,<ref name="pmid18071034">{{cite journal |author=Corvol JC, Anzouan-Kacou JB, Fauveau E, Bonnet AM, Lebrun-Vignes B, Girault C, Agid Y, Lechat P, Isnard R, Lacomblez L |title=Heart valve regurgitation, pergolide use, and parkinson disease: an observational study and meta-analysis |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=1721–6 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18071034 |doi=10.1001/archneur.64.12.1721 |url=}}</ref> it does not always develop, and consistent daily use over an extended period tends to be most strongly predictive of development of valvopathy.<ref name="pmid12486432">{{cite journal |author=Sachdev M, Miller WC, Ryan T, Jollis JG |title=Effect of fenfluramine-derivative diet pills on cardiac valves: a meta-analysis of observational studies |journal=American Heart Journal |volume=144 |issue=6 |pages=1065–73 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12486432 |doi=10.1067/mhj.2002.126733 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12801402">{{cite journal |author=Hopkins PN, Polukoff GI |title=Risk of valvular heart disease associated with use of fenfluramine |journal=BMC Cardiovascular Disorders |volume=3|pages=5 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12801402 |pmc=194859 |doi=10.1186/1471-2261-3-5 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid17706566">{{cite journal |author=Antonini A, Poewe W |title=Fibrotic heart-valve reactions to dopamine-agonist treatment in Parkinson's disease |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=826–9 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17706566 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70218-1 |url=}}</ref> The drugs most classically associated with the condition are weight loss drugs such as fenfluramine and chlorphentermine, and anti-parkinsonian drugs such as pergolide and cabergoline, which are prescribed to be taken several times a day, often for months or years at a time.

=== Diet and weight loss drugs which stimulate serotonin receptors ===
Some [[weight loss drug|appetite suppressant]] drugs such as [[fenfluramine]], [[chlorphentermine]], and [[aminorex]] induce a similar pattern of cardiac fibrosis (and also pulmonary hypertension), apparently by over-stimulating 5HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors on the cardiac fibroblast cells. These drugs consequently tended to cause increased risk of heart valve damage and subsequent heart failure, which eventually led to them being withdrawn from the market.

=== Anti-migraine drugs targeted at vasoconstrictive serotonin receptors, which also bind to 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors ===
Certain anti-migraine drugs which are targeted at serotonin receptors as vasoconstrictive agents, have long been known to be associated with [[pulmonary hypertension]] and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] (both vasoconstrictive effects), as well as [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]] (a fibrotic cell/fibrocyte proliferation effect, thought to be similar to cardiac valve fibrosis). These include [[ergotamine]] and [[methysergide]]. Both drugs can also cause cardiac fibrosis.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=AW7M6jBixj4C&pg=PA626&lpg=PA626&dq=ergotamine+endocardial+fibrosis&source=web&ots=BrjNzsIc-N&sig=X-WM0TaoW6I5nkx6xiTsxJYvLHo.

=== Antiparkinsonian drugs which cross-react with 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors ===

Certain anti-parkisonian drugs, although targeted at dopaminergic receptors, cross-react with serotoninergic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors as well, and have been reported to cause cardiac fibrosis.

An example is [[pergolide]]. The drug was in decreasing use since reported in 2003 to be associated with cardiac fibrosis.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm | year = 2004 | month = August | title = Cardiac valvulopathy with pergolide | author = ADRAC | journal = Aust Adv Drug React Bull | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | authorlink = Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee}} [http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm Free full text] from the [[Australia]]n [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]</ref> In March 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies.<ref name="FDAwithdraw">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm#Pergolide | title = MedWatch - 2007 Safety Information Alerts.

One study of human users of "[[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]" found that they did have heart valve changes suggestive of early cardiac fibrosis, which were not present in non-ecstasy using controls,<ref name="pmid17950805">{{cite journal |author=Droogmans S, Cosyns B, D'haenen H, Creeten E, Weytjens C, Franken PR, Scott B, Schoors D, Kemdem A, Close L, Vandenbossche JL, Bechet S, Van Camp G |title=Possible association between 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine abuse and valvular heart disease |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=1442–5 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17950805 |doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.06.045 |url=}}</ref> suggesting that ecstasy use certainly has the potential to cause this kind of heart damage. On the other hand there is no statistical evidence as yet to suggest significant increases in rates of cardiac valvopathies in current or former MDMA users, and it is most likely that as with other 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> agonists, development of heart valve damage will be highly dependent on the frequency and duration of use and the total cumulative exposure over time, and only a small proportion of the heaviest users are likely to face a substantial risk of heart damage.

The chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]] first popularized MDMA and MDA, and he invented DOI and many other recreational drugs that are also 5HT-2B receptor agonists.  In 2008 Shulgin underwent surgery to replace a defective aortic heart valve.  It is unknown whether or not Shulgin's lifelong use of psychedelic drugs caused the failure of his heart valve.
== Other serotonergic pharmacologics in question ==

The [[SSRI]] antidepressants raise blood serotonin levels {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, and thus may be capable of the same risks, though it is thought that the risk is substantially lower with such drugs. The amino acid [[L-tryptophan]] also raises blood serotonin, and may present the same risk as well; though, again, the risk is considered to be low.

However, the tryptophan derivative [[5-HTP]] (5-hydroxytryptophan), used in the treatment of depression, raises blood serotonin level considerably{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. It has yet to be reported to be associated with valve disease or other fibrosis, but for the previous theoretical reasons, it has been suggested as a possible danger.

When 5-HTP is used in medicine, it is generally administered along with [[carbidopa]],<ref>{{Cite pmid|6182005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|2945645}}</ref> which prevents the peripheral decarboxylation of 5-HTP to serotonin and so ensures that only brain serotonin levels are increased without producing peripheral side effects, however 5-HTP is also sold without carbidopa as a dietary supplement, and may have increased risks when taken by itself without carbidopa.

== Possible treatments ==

The most obvious treatment for cardiac valve fibrosis or fibrosis in other locations, consists of stopping the stimulatory drug or production of serotonin. Surgical tricuspid valve replacement for severe stenosis (blockage of blood flow) has been necessary in some patients.

A compound found in red wine, [[resveratrol]] has been found to slow the development of cardiac fibrosis.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15498824}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|18356487}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|19049292}}</ref> More sophisticated approaches of countering cardiac fibrosis like microRNA inhibition ([[MIRN21|miR-21]], for example) are being tested in animal models.
