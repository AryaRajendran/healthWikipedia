'''Postherpetic neuralgia''' (PHN) is a nerve pain due to damage caused by the [[varicella zoster virus]].  Typically, the [[neuralgia]] is confined to a [[dermatomic area]] of the skin and follows an outbreak of [[herpes zoster]] (HZ, commonly known as '''shingles''') in that same dermatomic area.  The neuralgia typically begins when the HZ [[vesicle (dermatology)|vesicle]]s have crusted over and begun to heal, but it can begin in the absence of HZ, in which case '''zoster sine herpete''' is presumed (see [[Herpes zoster]]).

Treatment options for PHN include [[antidepressant]]s, anticonvulsants (such as [[gabapentin]], [[pregabalin]], or [[topiramate]]) and topical agents such as lidocaine patches or [[capsaicin]] lotion.  Opioid analgesics may also be appropriate in many situations.  There are some sporadically successful experimental treatments, such as rhizotomy (severing or damaging the affected nerve to relieve pain) and [[TENS]] (a type of electrical pulse therapy).

==Pathophysiology==
Postherpetic neuralgia is thought to be nerve damage caused by herpes zoster. The damage causes nerves in the affected [[dermatomic area]] of the skin to send abnormal electrical signals to the brain.  These signals may convey excruciating [[pain]], and may persist or recur for months, years or for life.

A key factor in the neural plasticity underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss . Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of PHN.

===Frequency===
In the United States each year approximately 1,000,000 individuals develop herpes zoster. Of those individuals approximately 20%, or 200,000 individuals, develop postherpetic neuralgia.

Less than 10 percent of people younger than 60 develop postherpetic neuralgia after a bout of HZ, while about 40 percent of people older than 60 do.

===Predisposing factors===
* Race: It may influence susceptibility to herpes zoster. African Americans are one fourth as likely as Caucasians to develop this condition.
*Often an older, debilitated or immune compromised population.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms:
* With resolution of the HZ eruption, pain that continues for 3 months or more is defined as PHN.
* Pain is variable from discomfort to very severe and may be described as burning, stabbing, or gnawing.

Signs:
* Area of previous HZ may show evidence of [[cutaneous]] scarring.
* Sensation may be altered over involved areas, in the form of either hypersensitivity or decreased sensation.
* In rare cases, the patient might also experience muscle weakness, tremor or paralysis — if the nerves involved also control muscle movement.

==Lab and imaging studies==
Lab Studies:
* No laboratory work is usually necessary.
* Results of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) evaluation are abnormal in 61%.
** [[Pleocytosis]] is observed in 46%, elevated protein in 26%, and VZV DNA in 22%.
* These findings are not predictive of the PHN clinical course.
* Viral culture or [[immunofluorescence]] staining may be used to differentiate herpes simplex from herpes zoster in cases that are difficult to distinguish clinically.
* [[Antibodies]] to herpes zoster can be measured. A 4-fold increase has been used to support the diagnosis of subclinical herpes zoster (zoster sine herpete). However, a rising titer secondary to viral exposure rather than reactivation cannot be ruled out.

Imaging Studies:
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) lesions attributable to HZ were seen in the brain stem and cervical cord in 56% (9/16) of patients.
* At 3 months after onset of HZ, 56% (5/9) of patients with an abnormal MRI had developed PHN.
* Of the 7 patients who had no HZ-related lesions on MRI, none had residual pain.

==Treatment==
Treatment for postherpetic neuralgia depends on the type and characteristics of pain experienced by the patient. Pain control is essential to quality patient care; it ensures patient comfort. Possible options include:

* [[Antiviral drug|Antiviral]] agents, such as [[famciclovir]], are given at the onset of attacks of herpes zoster to shorten the clinical course and to help prevent complications such as postherpetic neuralgia.  However they have no role to play following the acute attack if postherpetic neuralgia has become established.
* [[Analgesics]]
**Locally applied [[topical]] agents
*** Aspirin mixed into an appropriate solvent such as [[diethyl ether]] may reduce pain.<ref name="pmid1594261">{{cite journal |author=De Benedittis G, Besana F, Lorenzetti A |title=A new topical treatment for acute herpetic neuralgia and post-herpetic neuralgia: the aspirin/diethyl ether mixture.

*** [[Lidocaine]] skin patches. These are small, bandage-like patches that contain the topical, pain-relieving medication lidocaine. The patches, available by prescription, must be applied directly to painful skin to deliver relief for four to 12 hours. Patches containing lidocaine can also be used on the face, taking care to avoid mucus membranes e.g. eyes, nose and mouth.
** Systemically delivered
*** Non-opiates such as  [[paracetamol]] or the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.
*** [[Opioid]]s provide more potent pain control and the weaker members such as [[codeine]] may be available over the counter in combination with paracetamol ([[co-codamol]]). Other opioids are prescription-only and include higher dosages of codeine, [[tramadol]], [[morphine]] or  [[fentanyl]].  Most opioids have sedating properties, which are beneficial for patients who experience pain.
*Pain modification therapy
** [[Antidepressant]]s. These drugs affect key brain chemicals, including [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]], that play a role in both depression and how your body interprets pain. Doctors typically prescribe antidepressants for postherpetic neuralgia in smaller doses than they do for depression. Low dosages of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, including [[amitriptyline]], seem to work best for deep, aching pain. They don't eliminate the pain, but they may make it easier to tolerate. Other prescription antidepressants (e.g. [[venlafaxine]], [[bupropion]] and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s) may be [[off-label use]]d in postherpetic neuralgia and generally prove less effective, although they may be better tolerated than the tricyclics.
** [[Anticonvulsant]]s. These agents are used to manage severe muscle spasms and provide sedation in neuralgia. They have central effects on pain modulation. Medications such as [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin, Phenytek), used to treat seizures, also can lessen the pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia. The medications stabilize abnormal electrical activity in the nervous system caused by injured nerves. Doctors often prescribe another anticonvulsant called [[carbamazepine]] (Carbatrol, Tegretol) for sharp, jabbing pain. Newer anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and [[lamotrigine]] (Lamictal), are generally tolerated better and can help control burning and pain.
* [[Corticosteroid]]s are commonly prescribed but a [[Cochrane Review]] found limited evidence and no benefit.<ref name="pmid21154361">{{cite journal |author=Chen N, Yang M, He L, Zhang D, Zhou M, Zhu C |title=Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=12 |pages=CD005582 |year=2010 |pmid=21154361 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005582.pub3 |editor1-last=He |editor1-first=Li}}</ref>

*Other non-pharmacological treatments for postherpetic neuralgia include the following:
**[[Relaxation techniques]]. These can include breathing exercises, visualization and distraction.
**[[Heat therapy]].
**Cold therapy. Cold packs can be used.
**[[Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation]] (TENS). This involves the stimulation of peripheral nerve endings by the delivery of electrical energy through the surface of the skin.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Doble S |title= Spinal Management of patients with post-herpetic neuralgia |journal= Nursing Standard |volume=22 |issue=39 |pages=49–56 |year=2008 |pmid= 18578133 }}</ref>
**[[Spinal cord stimulator]]. The electrical stimulation of the posterior spinal cord works by activating supraspinal and spinal inhibitory pain mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Harke H, Gretenkort P, Ladleif HU, Koester P, Rahman S |title= Spinal cord stimulation in postherpetic neuralgia and in acute herpes zoster pain |journal= Anesthesia & Analgesia |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=694–700 |year=2002 |pmid=11867400 |doi= 10.1097/00000539-200203000-00040}}</ref>

In some cases, treatment of postherpetic neuralgia brings complete pain relief. But most people still experience some pain, and a few don't receive any relief. Although some people must live with postherpetic neuralgia the rest of their lives, most people can expect the condition to gradually disappear on its own within five years.

High-Concentration Capsaicin Patch Granted Orphan Drug Designation for PHN
from:http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/704117?sssdmh=dm1.489879&src=ddd  On June 9, 2009, The FDA approved orphan drug designation for a high-concentration capsaicin dermal patch (Qutenza [formerly NGX-4010], NeurogesX, Inc) for the treatment of pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).  Relief of pain is possible up to three months with no to minimal{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} side effects. Qutenza has been recently{{When|date=September 2011}} approved by the FDA for general use in PHN. Distribution is planned for the first half of 2010.{{update after|2010|06|30}} See NeutrogesX for distribution plans.

==Prognosis==
* The natural history of PHN involves slow resolution of the pain syndrome.
* In those patients who develop PHN, most will respond to agents such as the tricyclic antidepressants.
* A subgroup of patients may develop severe, long-lasting pain that does not respond to medical therapy. Continued research for new agents is necessary.

==Prevention==
===Primary prevention===
In 1995, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the [[Varicella vaccine]] to prevent chickenpox. Its effect on PHN is still unknown. The vaccine — made from a weakened form of the varicella-zoster virus — may keep chickenpox from occurring in nonimmune children and adults, or at least lessen the risk of the chickenpox virus lying dormant in the body and reactivating later as shingles. If shingles could be prevented, postherpetic neuralgia could be completely avoided.

In May 2006 the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] approved a new vaccine by Merck ([[Zostavax]]) against shingles. This vaccine is a more potent version of the [[varicella vaccine|chickenpox vaccine]], and evidence shows that it reduces the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen N, Li Q, Zhang Y, Zhou M, Zhou D, He L |title=Vaccination for preventing postherpetic neuralgia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD007795 |year=2011 |pmid=21412911 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007795.pub2 |editor1-last=He |editor1-first=Li}}</ref> The CDC recommends use of this vaccine in all persons over 60 years old.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/shingles/default.htm</ref>

===Secondary prevention===
* A [[meta-analysis]] reported that treating zoster at the time of rash with antiviral agents such as [[acyclovir]] did not reduce the chance of postherpetic neuralgia.<ref name="pmid19370655">{{cite journal |author=Li Q, Chen N, Yang J, ''et al.'' |title=Antiviral treatment for preventing postherpetic neuralgia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD006866 |year=2009 |pmid=19370655 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006866.pub2 |editor1-last=He |editor1-first=Li}}</ref>
* A [[randomized controlled trial]] found that [[amitryptyline]] 25&nbsp;mg per night for 90 days starting within two days of onset of rash can reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia from 35% to 16% ([[number needed to treat]] is 6).<ref name="pmid9204652">{{cite journal |author=Bowsher D |title=The effects of pre-emptive treatment of postherpetic neuralgia with amitriptyline: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Journal of pain and symptom management |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=327–31 |year=1997 |pmid=9204652 |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(97)00077-8}}</ref>
