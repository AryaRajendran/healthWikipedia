'''Alendronic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''alendronate sodium''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) — sold as '''Fosamax''' by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] — is a [[bisphosphonate]] [[medication|drug]] used for [[osteoporosis]] and several other bone diseases. It is marketed alone as well as in combination with [[vitamin D]] (2,800 IU and 5600 IU, under the name '''Fosamax+D'''). Merck's [[United States|U.S.]] patent on alendronate expired in 2008 and Merck lost a series of appeals to block a generic version of the drug from being certified by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

On February 6, 2008, the US FDA approved the first generic versions of alendronate, which were marketed by [[Barr Pharmaceuticals]] and [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]] USA. Teva Pharmaceuticals manufactures generic alendronate in 5-milligram, 10-milligram, and 40-milligram daily doses, and in 35-milligram and 70-milligram weekly doses, while Barr made generic alendronate in 70-milligram tablets, which were taken once weekly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=87025 |title=First Generic Fosamax OK'd by FDA |accessdate=2008-02-21 |format= |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080210074716/http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=87025| archivedate= 10 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Barr pharmaceuticals were subsequently acquired by Teva in July 2008.

==Pharmacokinetics==
As with all potent bisphosphonates, the systemic bioavailability after oral dosing is low, averaging only 0.6–0.7% in women and in men under fasting conditions. Intake together with meals and beverages other than water further reduces the bioavailability. The absorbed drug rapidly partitions, with approximately 50% binding to the exposed bone surface; the remainder is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Unlike most drugs, the strong negative charge on the two phosphonate moieties limits oral bioavailability, and, in turn, the exposure to tissues other than bone is very low. After absorption in the bone, alendronate has an estimated terminal half-life of 10 years.<ref name="pmid8689235">{{cite journal | author = Shinkai I, Ohta Y | title = New drugs--reports of new drugs recently approved by the FDA.

==Pharmacology==
Alendronate inhibits [[osteoclast]]-mediated bone-resorption.  Like all bisphosphonates, it is chemically related to inorganic [[pyrophosphate]], the endogenous regulator of bone turnover.  But while pyrophosphate inhibits both osteoclastic [[bone resorption]] and the mineralization of the bone newly formed by [[osteoblast]]s, alendronate specifically inhibits bone resorption without any effect on mineralization at pharmacologically achievable doses.  Its inhibition of bone-resorption is dose-dependent and approximately 1,000 times stronger than the equimolar effect of the first bisphosphonate drug, [[etidronate]].   Under therapy, normal bone tissue develops, and alendronate is deposited in the bone-matrix in pharmacologically inactive form. For optimal action, enough calcium and vitamin D are needed in the body in order to promote normal bone development. [[Hypocalcemia]] should, therefore, be corrected before starting therapy.

Etidronate has the same disadvantage as pyrophosphate in inhibiting mineralization, but all of the potent ''[[nitrogen|N]]''-containing bisphosphonates including Alendronate and also [[risedronate]], [[ibandronate]], and [[zoledronate]], do not.

==Clinical data==
Treatment of post-menopausal women with ''Fosamax'' has demonstrated normalization of the rate of bone turnover, significant increase in BMD (bone mineral density) of the spine, hip, wrist and total body, and significant reductions in the risk of vertebral (spine) fractures, wrist fractures, hip fractures, and all non-vertebral fractures.  In the women with the highest risk of fracture (by virtue of pre-existing vertebral fractures) in the Fracture Intervention Trial, treatment with ''Fosamax'' 5&nbsp;mg/day for two years followed by 10&nbsp;mg/day for the third year (plus calcium and vitamin D) resulted in approximately 50% reductions in fractures of the spine, hip, and wrist compared with the control group taking placebos plus calcium and vitamin D.<ref name="pmid8950879">{{cite journal | author = Black DM, Cummings SR, Karpf DB, Cauley JA, Thompson DE, Nevitt MC, Bauer DC, Genant HK, Haskell WL, Marcus R, Ott SM, Torner JC, Quandt SA, Reiss TF, Ensrud KE | title = Randomised trial of effect of alendronate on risk of fracture in women with existing vertebral fractures.

Studies are showing that people who have taken Fosamax for more than five years are at risk for developing these kind of fractures.  In some cases, patients have reported that, after weeks or months of unexplained aching, their thigh bones simply snapped while they were walking or standing.  One doctor reports that a 59-year old previously healthy woman visiting New York City was riding a subway train one morning when the train jolted. She shifted all her weight to one leg, felt a bone snap, and fell to the floor of the train.  An x-ray in a local emergency room revealed a comminuted spiral fracture involving the upper half of the right femur.  She had been taking Fosamax for 7 years.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Should Bisphosphonates be Continued Indefinitely?

==Interactions==
* Milk, diet, and drugs containing high amounts of calcium, magnesium or aluminium (antacids): the resorption of alendronate is decreased. At least half an hour should pass after intake of alendronate before taking the supplement or drug.
* Highly active vitamin D analogues or fluorides: no data is available. Concomitant treatment should be avoided.
* The additional beneficial effect of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|HRT]] (hormone replacement therapy) with [[estrogens]]/[[progestins]] or [[raloxifene]] in postmenopausal women remains to be elucidated, but no interactions have been seen. The combination is therefore possible.
* Intravenous [[ranitidine]] increases the oral bioavailability of alendronate. No clinical consequences are known.
* The combination of [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s and alendronate may increase the risk of gastric ulcers. Both these drugs have the potential to irritate the upper gastro-intestinal mucosa.

==Dosage==
* Prophylaxis of osteoporosis in women: 5–10&nbsp;mg daily or 35–70&nbsp;mg weekly.
* Therapy of osteoporosis in women and men : 10&nbsp;mg daily or 70&nbsp;mg weekly.
* Osteoporosis under corticosteroids: 5–10&nbsp;mg daily or 35–70&nbsp;mg weekly in men and premenopausal women or those receiving concomitant HRT. In postmenopausal women not receiving HRT, the recommended dose is 10&nbsp;mg daily or 70&nbsp;mg weekly.
* Paget's Disease: 40&nbsp;mg daily for 6 months.

The risk of esophageal irritation places special requirements on how one takes this oral drug.  The patient should take the drug only upon rising for the day with three swallows of water, not to exceed 6-8 oz., and stand, walk, or sit, and remain fasting for 30–45 minutes afterwards, then eat breakfast.  Lying down or reclining after taking the drug and prior to eating breakfast may cause gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal irritation.

==Dosage forms==
* Fosamax solution 70&nbsp;mg/75ml
* Fosamax tablets 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg, 35&nbsp;mg, 40&nbsp;mg, and 70&nbsp;mg

==Bis-phossy jaw==
The term given by scientists to the link between bisphosphonates and jaw necrosis is 'bis-phossy jaw.'  This is derived from the 19th-century term [[phossy jaw]], given its name after workers in match factories working with [[white phosphorus]] developed [[osteonecrosis]] of the jaw.
