'''Sleep state misperception''' (SSM) is a term in the [[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]] (ICSD) most commonly used for people who mistakenly perceive their [[sleep]] as wakefulness,<ref name=minecan2008>Minecan, Daniela, and Antonio Culebras. <nowiki>http://www.medlink.com/web_content/MLT0003S.asp</nowiki>{{Dead link|date=October 2010}} "Sleep state misperception."

Moreover, patients are otherwise generally in good  health,<ref name=minecan2008/> and any ills—such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]—appear to be more associated with fear of negative consequences of insomnia ("insomnia phobia") than from any actual loss of sleep.<ref name=case2008>{{cite journal |last1=Case |first1=K |last2=Hurwitz |first2=TD |last3=Kim |first3=SW |last4=Cramer-Bornemann |first4=M |last5=Schenck |first5=CH |title=A case of extreme paradoxical insomnia responding selectively to electroconvulsive therapy |journal=Journal of clinical sleep medicine |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=62–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18350965 |pmc=2276826}}</ref>

Sleep state misperception was adopted by the ICSD to replace two previous [[diagnosis|diagnostic terminologies]]: "subjective insomnia complaint without objective findings" and "subjective sleepiness complaint without objective findings."<ref name=minecan2008/>

Other synonyms of the term include: '''paradoxical insomnia''', '''pseudo-insomnia''', '''subjective insomnia''', '''subjective sleepiness''', and '''sleep hypochondriasis.'''<ref name=minecan2008/>

==Classification==
Sleep state misperception is classified as an intrinsic [[dyssomnia]].<ref>''[http://www.icantgetnosleep.info/dysomnia-causes/ Dysomnia causes]''. Icantgetnosleep.info. November 4, 2009{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}</ref><ref>''[http://holisticonline.com/remedies/sleep/sleep_international_classification.htm The International Classification of Sleep Disorders].'' Holisticonline.com{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}</ref> While SSM is regarded a sub-type of [[insomnia]], it is also established as a separate sleep-condition, with distinct [[pathophysiology]].<ref name=minecan2008/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Edinger |first1=J |last2=Krystal |first2=AD |title=Subtyping primary insomnia: is sleep state misperception a distinct clinical entity? |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=203–14 |year=2003 |pmid=12927120 |doi=10.1053/smrv.2002.0253}}</ref> Nonetheless, the value of distinguishing this type of insomnia from other types is debatable due to the relatively low frequency of SSM being reported.<ref name=kushida2008/>

Sleep state misperception can also be further broken down into several types, by patients who—
* report short sleep (subjective insomnia complaint without objective findings)<ref name=minecan2008/>
** or no sleep at all (subjective ''total'' insomnia)<ref name=mccall1992/>
* report [[excessive daytime sleepiness]] (subjective sleepiness complaint without objective findings)<ref name=minecan2008/>
* report sleeping too much (subjective [[hypersomnia]] without objective findings)<ref name=trajanovic2006/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=R. M. |last2=Roffwarg |first2=HP |last3=Kennedy |first3=SJ |last4=Guilleminault |first4=C |last5=Cinque |first5=J |last6=Cohn |first6=MA |last7=Karacan |first7=I |last8=Kupfer |first8=DJ |last9=Lemmi |first9=H |title=Sleep-wake disorders based on a polysomnographic diagnosis. A national cooperative study |journal=JAMA |volume=247 |issue=7 |pages=997–1003 |year=1982 |pmid=7057593 |doi=10.1001/jama.247.7.997}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
SSM is poorly understood. As of 2008, there is little to no information regarding [[risk factor]]s or prevention,<ref name=minecan2008/> though it is believed to be most prevalent among young to middle aged adults.<ref name=kushida2008/>

Distribution among the general population and by [[gender]] is unknown. About 5% of the clinical population is affected,<ref name=kushida2008/> though that figure is subject to [[sampling bias]].

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
[[File:Sleep EEG Stage 1.jpg|thumb|[[Electroencephalography#Wave_patterns|Sleep waves]] ([[Electroencephalography|EEG]] highlighted above) recorded from those with SSM are indistinguishable from those without.]]
This [[sleep disorder]] frequently applies when [[patient]]s report not feeling tired despite their [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[perception]] of not having slept.<ref>[http://www.sleepnet.com/insomnia.html Insomnia Information] Sleepnet.com - Insomnia Information{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}</ref> Alternatively, patients may report [[excessive daytime sleepiness]] or insomnia, while lacking factors often associated with those symptoms such as [[sleep apnea]] [[syndrome]] or nocturnal sleep disturbance. Generally, they may describe experiencing several years of no sleep, short sleep, or non-restorative sleep. Otherwise, patients appear healthy, both [[Psychiatry|psychiatrically]] and [[Medicine|medically]].<ref name=minecan2008/> (That this condition is often [[asymptomatic]] could explain why it is relatively unreported.)

However, upon clinical observation, it is found that patients may severely overestimate [[Sleep onset latency|the time they took to fall asleep]]—often reporting having slept half the amount of time indicated by [[polysomnogram]] or [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), which may record normal sleep.<ref name=healthcom /> Thus, it becomes evident that the perception of poor sleep is primarily [[illusion]]ary. Moreover, reports of daytime sleepiness may be a result of the [[nocebo]] response—the reverse of the [[placebo]] effect—due to patient expectations of adverse effects from their subjective perception of poor sleep.

Due to the subjective nature of this complaint, which depends on patient self-reporting of sleep, it is not currently measurable by [[Objectivity (philosophy)#The scientific virtues|objective]] means.<ref name=minecan2008/><ref name=kushida2008/> One woman affected by SSM began contemplating suicide “because no one can figure out what is wrong with me” after being repeatedly dismissed as normal by various doctors and receiving insomnia treatments that did not work from others.<ref name=case2008/>

A recent study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine has shown that sleep misperception (i.e., underestimation of sleep duration) is prevalent among chronic insomniacs who sleep objectively more than 6 hours in the sleep lab. The psychological profile of these chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration is characterized by depressive, anxious-ruminative traits and poor coping resources. Thus, it appears that not all chronic insomniacs underestimate their sleep duration, and that sleep misperception is a clinical characteristic of chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Furthermore, rumination and poor coping resources may play a significant role in sleep misperception.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Treatment==
Behavioral treatment can be effective in some cases.<ref name=minecan2008/> [[Sedative]] hypnotics may also help relieve the [[symptom]]s.<ref>Hauri PJ. "Primary insomnia." ''Principles and practice of sleep medicine.'' 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1994.{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}</ref> Additionally, education about normal patterns of the [[Circadian rhythm|sleep-wake cycle]] may alleviate [[anxiety]] in some patients.<ref name=minecan2008/> For patients with severe depression resulting from the fear of having insomnia, [[electroconvulsive therapy]] appears to be a safe and effective treatment.<ref name=case2008/>

===Complications===
The condition may worsen as a result of persistent attempts to treat the symptoms through conventional methods of dealing with insomnia. The [[Medical prescription|prescription]] of [[hypnotic]]s or [[stimulant]]s may lead to [[Physical dependence|drug dependency]] as a complication.<ref name=minecan2008/>

Nonetheless, chronic SSM may increase risk for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], anxiety, and [[substance abuse]].<ref name=kushida2008/> It has also been noted that patients with this condition may sometimes opt to take medications over other treatments "for the wrong reasons (e.g. because of euphoriant properties)."<ref name=littner2003>{{cite journal |last1=Littner |first1=M |last2=Hirshkowitz |first2=M |last3=Kramer |first3=M |last4=Kapen |first4=S |last5=Anderson |first5=WM |last6=Bailey |first6=D |last7=Berry |first7=RB |last8=Davila |first8=D |last9=Johnson |first9=S |title=Practice parameters for using polysomnography to evaluate insomnia: an update |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=754–60 |year=2003 |pmid=14572131}}</ref>

==Distinction from "true" insomnia==
Objective [[insomnia]], unlike SSM, can be confirmed [[empirical]]ly through clinical testing, such as by polysomnogram.<ref name=littner2003/> In other words, those who experience SSM may believe that they have not slept for extended periods of time, when they in fact do sleep but without perceiving so.

Moreover, cases of objective total insomnia are extremely rare. The few that have been recorded have predominantly been ascribed to a rare incurable genetic disorder called [[fatal familial insomnia]], which patients rarely survive for more than 26 months after the onset of illness—often much less.<ref>Schenkein, Joyce ''[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/542963_2 Fatal Familial Insomnia. Part 1: What Is Fatal Familial Insomnia].'' Medscape.</ref>  While rarer cases of objective total [[insomnia]] lasting for decades have been reported, such as with the American [[Al Herpin]] and the Vietnamese [[Thai Ngoc]], they have not been studied extensively in a clinical setting.<ref>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/2855/ Ngoc Thai: The Man Who Doesn’t Sleep</ref><ref>[http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/the-man-who-never-slept.html The Man Who Never Slept: Fatal Familial Insomnia and Total Sleep Deprivation]</ref>
