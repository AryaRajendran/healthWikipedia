'''Phagophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] φαγεῖν - ''phagein'', "eat"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfagei%3Dn φαγεῖν], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and φόβος - ''phobos'', "fear"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) is a psychogenic [[dysphagia]], a fear of [[swallowing]].<ref name =shapiro>Shapiro J, Franko DL, Gagne A. Phagophobia: a form of psychogenic dysphagia. A new entity. Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol 1997; 106: 286-290.</ref> It is expressed in various swallowing complaints without any apparent physical reason detectable by physical inspection and laboratory analyses. An obsolete term for this phobia is '''choking phobia''',<ref>McNally RJ. Choking phobia: a review of the literature. Compr Psychiatry 1994; 35: 83-89.</ref> but it was suggested that the latter term is confusing and it is necessary to distinguish the fear of swallowing (i.e., of the propulsion of [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]]) from [[Pseudodysphagia|fear of choking]].<ref name=shapiro/> 

Phagophobia is classified as a [[specific phobia]] and according to [[DSM-IV]] classification it belongs to the category of "other phobias". Phagophobia may lead to (and be confused with) [[fear of eating]], and the subsequent [[malnutrition]] and [[weight loss]]. In milder cases a phagophobe eats only soft and liquid foods.<ref>[http://tjp.dergisi.org/text.php3?id=309 Müzeyyen Çiyiltepe, Tümer Türkbay, Phagophobia: a case report], The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics, 2006, Volume 48, Number 1, Page(s) 080-084</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}
