'''Proteinuria''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|t|iː|ˈ|n|ʊər|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|t|iː|ˈ|nj|ʊər|i|ə}}; from ''protein'' and ''urine'') means the presence of an excess of [[Blood plasma|serum]] [[protein]]s in the [[urine]]. The excess protein in the urine often causes the urine to become foamy, although foamy urine may also be caused by [[bilirubin]] in the urine ([[bilirubinuria]]),<ref name="Retrieved 2007-01-20">[http://www.pathguy.com/lectures/urine.htm URINALYSIS] Ed Friedlander, M.D., Pathologist - Retrieved 2007-01-20</ref> [[retrograde ejaculation]],<ref>[http://www.medhelp.org/forums/urology/archive/195.html foamy urine - Urology - MedHelp] Retrieved 2007-01-20</ref> pneumaturia (air bubbles in the urine) due to a [[fistula]],<ref>{{GPnotebook|1161101335|Pneumaturia}} Retrieved 2007-01-20</ref> or drugs such as [[pyridium]].<ref name="Retrieved 2007-01-20"/> 

Up to 150&nbsp;mg a day of protein may be excreted by a normal person, primarily the [[Tamm-Horsfall protein]].

== Causes ==
There are three main mechanisms to cause proteinuria:
* Due to disease in  [[glomerulus]]
* Because of increased quantity of proteins in [[blood serum|serum]]  (overflow proteinuria)
* Due to low reabsorption at [[proximal tubule]] ([[Fanconi syndrome]])

Proteinuria can also be caused by certain biological agents, such as [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin) used in cancer treatment, or by excessive fluid intake (drinking in excess of 4 litres of water per day).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1503/cmaj.070792|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=378f85de-27de-4046-815e-293b772666e5 |title=Drinking too much water called latest threat to health |date=January 2008 |publisher=Montreal Gazette}}</ref>

Conventionally, proteinuria is diagnosed by a simple [[dipstick]] test, although it is possible for the test to give a false negative reading,<ref>Simerville JA, Maxted WC, and Pahira JJ. [http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0315/p1153.html Urinalysis: A Comprehensive Review] Am Fam Physician. 2005 Mar 15;71(6):1153-1162.

Recent technologies used to detect [[human serum albumin]] (HSA) is through the use of [[liquid crystal]]s (LCs). The presence of HSA molecules disrupts the LCs supported on the AHSA-decorated slides thereby producing bright optical signals which are easily distinguishable.=using this assay can be as low as 15&nbsp;ug/mL.<ref name="Aliño">{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/c1an15143f|author=Aliño, Vera Joanne R. and Yang, Kun-Lin |title=Using liquid crystals as a readout system in urinary albumin assays. |journal=Analyst|volume=20|issue=4 |pages=893–900 |year=2011 |pmid=21709868}}</ref> 

Alternatively the concentration of protein in the urine may be compared to the [[creatinine]] level in a spot urine sample. This is termed the protein/creatinine ratio (PCR). The 2005 UK Chronic Kidney Disease guidelines states PCR is a better test than 24 hour urinary protein measurement. Proteinuria is defined as a protein/creatinine ratio greater than 45&nbsp;mg/mmol (which is equivalent to [[Microalbuminuria|albumin/creatinine ratio]] of greater than 30&nbsp;mg/mmol or approximately 300&nbsp;mg/g) with very high levels of proteinuria being for a PCR greater than 100&nbsp;mg/mmol.<ref>{{cite web |title=Identification, management and referral of adults with chronic kidney disease: concise guidelines |url=http://www.renal.org/CKDguide/full/Conciseguid141205.pdf |format=PDF |date= 2005-09-27 |publisher=UK Renal Association}} - see Guideline 4 Confirmation of proteinuria, on page 9</ref>

Protein dipstick measurements should not be confused with the amount of protein detected on a test for [[microalbuminuria]] which denotes values for protein for urine in '''mg/day''' versus urine protein dipstick values which denote values for protein in '''mg/dL'''.  That is, there is a basal level of proteinuria that can occur below 30&nbsp;mg/day which is considered non-pathology. Values between 30–300&nbsp;mg/day are termed [[microalbuminuria]] which is considered pathologic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Urinary dipstick protein: a poor predictor of absent or severe proteinuria.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8296815|work=PMID 8296815|publisher=Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1994 Jan;170(1 Pt 1):137-41.}}</ref>  Urine protein lab values for microalbumin of >30&nbsp;mg/day correspond to a detection level within the "trace" to "1+" range of a urine dipstick protein assay.  Therefore, positive indication of any protein detected on a urine dipstick assay obviates any need to perform a urine microalbumin test as the upper limit for microalbuminuria has already been exceeded.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Urine Dipstick|url=http://www.georgiahealth.edu/alliedhealth/pa/documents/ClinicianReviewsCC.UrineDipstick.Gunder.pdf|publisher=Georgia Regents University}}</ref>

==Associated conditions==
Proteinuria may be a sign of renal ([[kidney]]) damage.  Since serum proteins are readily reabsorbed from urine, the presence of excess protein indicates either an insufficiency of absorption or impaired filtration.  [[Diabetics]] may suffer from damaged [[nephrons]] and develop proteinuria.  The most common cause of proteinuria is diabetes, and in any person with proteinuria and diabetes, the etiology of the underlying proteinuria should be separated into two categories: diabetic proteinuria versus the field.

With severe proteinuria, general [[hypoproteinemia]] can develop which results in
diminished [[oncotic pressure]].  Symptoms of diminished oncotic pressure may include [[ascites]], [[edema]] and [[hydrothorax]].

==Treatment==
Treating proteinuria mainly needs proper diagnosis of the cause.
The most common cause is [[diabetic nephropathy]]; in this case, proper glycemic control may slow the progression. Medical management consists of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are typically first-line therapy for proteinuria.  In patients whose proteinuria is not controlled with ACE inhibitors, the addition of an aldosterone antagonist (i.e., [[spironolactone]])<ref name="Mehdi">{{cite journal|doi=10.1681/ASN.2009070737|author=Mehdi UF, Adams-Huet B, Raskin P, et al. |title=Addition of angiotensin receptor blockade or mineralocorticoid antagonism to maximum angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in diabetic nephropathy. |journal=J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=20|issue=12 |pages=2641–50 |year=2009 |pmid=19926893|pmc=2794224 }}</ref> or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)<ref name="Burgess">{{cite journal|doi=10.1681/ASN.2008040416|author=Burgess E, Muirhead N, Rene de Cotret P, et al. |title=Supramaximal dose of candesartan in proteinuric renal disease. |journal=J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=20|issue=4 |pages=893–900 |year=2009 |pmid=19211712|pmc=2663827 }}</ref> may further reduce protein loss.  Caution must be used if these agents are added to ACE inhibitor therapy due to the risk of hyperkalemia.
Proteinuria secondary to autoimmune disease should be treated with steroids or steroid-sparing agent plus the use of ACE inhibitors.
