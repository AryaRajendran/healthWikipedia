'''Medulloepithelioma''' is a rare, primitive, fast growing [[brain tumour]] thought to stem from [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of the [[embryo]]nic [[medullary cavity]].<ref name="mondofacto.com">[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Medulloepithelioma Definition of Medulloepithelioma], from Online Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 7 January 2010.</ref> Tumours originating in the [[ciliary body]] of the [[human eye|eye]] are referred to as embryonal medulloepitheliomas,<ref name="mondofacto.com"/> or [[diktyoma]]s.<ref name="McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine">McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</ref>

A highly [[malignant]] [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]] primitive [[Neuroepithelial cell|neuroepithelial]] tumour of children, medulloepithelioma may contain [[bone]], [[cartilage]], [[skeletal muscle]], and tends to [[Metastasis|metastasize]] extracranially.<ref name="McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine"/>

==Epidemiology==
Medulloepithelioma most commonly affect children between 6 months and 5 years; rarely, this tumour may occur [[Congenital disorder|congenitally]] or beyond this age range.<ref name="Russel">Russel DS, Rubinstein LJ. Pathology of tumors the nervous system, 5th ed. Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins 1989; pp. 247-51.</ref><ref>Sato T, Shimoda A, Takahishi T, et al. Congenital cerebellar neuroepithelial tumor with multiple divergent differentiation. Acta Neuropathol 1980;50:143-6.</ref><ref>Scheithauer BW, Rubinstein LJ. Cerebral medulloepithelioma: Report of a case with multiple divergent neuroepithelial differentiation. Childs Brain 1979;5:62-71.</ref> [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is equal in males and females.<ref name="Molly">Molly PT, Yachnis AT, Rorke LB, et al. Central nervous system medulloepithelioma a series of eight cases including two arising in the pons. J Neurosurg 1996;84:430-6.</ref>

==Classification==
Medulloepithelioma was originally classified as the most primitive neoplasm of the [[Central Nervous System]] (CNS) by Bailey and Cushing in 1926.<ref name="Bailey">Bailey P, Cushing H. A classification of tumors of the glioma group on a histogenetic basis with a correlated study of progress. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott; 1926. pp. 54-6.</ref> Rorke et al.<ref>Rorke LB, Gilles FH, Davis RI, Becker LE. Revision of the World Health Organization classification of brain tumors for child hood brain tumors. Cancer 1985;56:1869-86.</ref> classified this tumour into two subtypes: 
:1) medulloepithelioma not otherwise specified
:2) medulloepithelioma with differentiation into [[astrocyte]]s, [[oligodendrocyte]]s; [[ependymal cell]]s; [[Neuron|neuronal cells]]; others ([[melanin]], [[mesenchymal cell]]s); and mixed cellular elements.

==Clinical manifestation==
Medulloepithelioma have been reported to occur in the [[cerebral hemispheres]], [[brainstem]], [[cerebellum]], and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral sites]].<ref name="Molly"/><ref name="Bailey"/><ref name="Karch">Karch SB, Urich H. Medulloepithelioma: definition of an entity. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 1972;31:27-53.</ref><ref name="Sundaram">Sundaram C, Vydehi BV, Reddy JJ, Reddy AK. Medulloepithelioma: A case report. Neurol India 2003;51:546-7.</ref>

Due to rapid growth of the tumour, patients typically present with [[Intracranial pressure|increased intracranial pressure]], [[seizure]]s, and [[focal neurologic signs]].<ref>[http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=brain_ca/17771&selectedTitle=2%7E3&source=search_result#H16 Uncommon brain tumors], from UpToDate Online 17.3. Last updated 21 July 2009, Retrieved 7 January 2010.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Medulloepithelioma.jpg|thumb|Neuronal differentiation, ranging from neuroblasts to ganglion cells, is seen in some medulloepitheliomas.]]Imaging studies such as [[Computerized Tomography]] (CT) and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) can aid [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Medulloepithelioma appears isodense or hypodense with variable heterogeneity and [[calcification]] on non-contrast CT scan, and enhances with contrast.<ref name="Molly"/> This radiographical finding is consistent with a primitive neuroectodermal tumour, especially in children.<ref name="Sundaram"/> Blood studies and imaging studies of the abdomen may be used to detect metastases.<ref name="Sundaram"/>

[[Needle aspiration biopsy]] can be used to aid diagnosis.<ref name="Sundaram"/> Definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination of surgically excised tumour tissues.

Histologically, medulloepithelioma resemble a primitive neural tube and with neuronal, glial and mesenchymal elements.<ref name="Russel"/><ref>Deck JHN. Cerebral medulloepithelioma with maturation into ependymal cells and ganglion cells. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 1969;28:442-54.</ref> [[Flexner-Wintersteiner rosette]]s may also be observed.<ref>McLean IW, Burnier MN, Zimmerman LE, et al. Tumors of the retina. In: Atlas of tumor pathology: tumors of the eye and ocular adnexa. Washington, DC: Armed Forces Institute of Pathology; 1994:97–154.</ref>

[[Immunohistochemistry|Immunohistochemically]], neural tube-like structures are [[vimentin]] positive in the majority of medulloepitheliomas.<ref>Troost D, Jansen GH, Dingemans KP. Cerebral medulloepithelioma - electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Acta Neuropathol 1990;80:103-7.</ref> Poorly differentiated medulloepitheliomas are vimentin negative.

== Treatment==
[[Segmental resection|Total resection]] of the tumour, followed by [[radiation therapy]] is the standard treatment modality.<ref name="Molly"/> Medulloepithelioma of the ciliary body may necessitate enucleation of the eye.<ref>al-Torbak A, Abboud EB, al-Sharif A, el-Okda MO.

Neuroimaging Clin N Am 2005; 15:69.</ref> Radiation therapy alone may prolong survival.<ref name="Molly"/> Aggressive [[chemotherapy]] with autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplant]] is used for metastatic medulloepitheliomas.<ref name="Sundaram"/>

==Prognosis==
Medulloepithelioma carries a dismal [[prognosis]] with a median survival of 5 months.<ref name="Molly"/><ref>Sharma MC; Mahapatra AK; Gaikwad S; Jain AK; Sarkar C.
