Toubia attended medical school in [[Egypt]].  In 1981, she completed her surgical training in the [[United Kingdom]], gaining an M.Phil and a PH.D in Public Health & Policy from the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] before becoming a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] and the first female surgeon in Sudan. In 1985 she returned to Sudan, where she was head of [[Paediatric]] Surgery at Khartoum Teaching Hospital <ref name=Rahman-Toubia /> and set up her own emergency clinic, but within a few years she was forced to leave again by the country's political instability.<ref name="Lancet 10.3.2007">[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)60394-8/fulltext "Nahid Toubia" by Priya Shetty, The Lancet, Volume 369, Issue 9564, Page 819, 10 March 2007 ] {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60394-8}}, accessed 20 August 2011</ref>  She returned to the UK, and began her research into [[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM).<ref name=BBC-Toubia>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1916917.stm |title=Changing attitudes to female circumcision |date=8 April 2002  |accessdate=20 August 2011 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> From 1990, she worked for four years at the [[Population Council]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="Lancet 10.3.2007" />

Toubia is the founder and president of [[RAINBO|Research, Action and Information Network for the Bodily Integrity of Women (Rainbo)]], an international organisation which works to eliminate FGM through womenâ€™s self-empowerment and social change. The organisation has offices in New York City and [[London]] and works in [[Uganda]], [[South Africa]], [[the Gambia]], and [[Nigeria]].<ref name="UoW Internet FGM resources">[http://womenst.library.wisc.edu/fc/fcwebfgm.htm "Internet-Based Resources on Female Genital Mutilation" by Tobe Levin, Office of University of Wisconsin System Women's Studies Librarian], accessed 20 August 2011</ref> Rainbo played a prominent role in changing the view of FGM from being a predominantly medical concern to a human rights issue.<ref name=BBC-Toubia />

In 2002 Toubia told the [[BBC World Service]] that the campaign against FGM was fundamentally about changing women's consciousness, and empowering them to change their social position. She said while most African governments, health professionals and [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] had the issue on their agenda, the greatest challenge was at grassroots level.  She said "By allowing your genitals to be removed [it is perceived that] you are heightened to another level of pure motherhood - a motherhood not tainted by sexuality and that is why the woman gives it away to become the matron, respected by everyone. By taking on this practise, which is a woman's domain, it actually empowers them. It is much more difficult to convince the women to give it up, than to convince the men." <ref name=BBC-Toubia />

Toubia is an Associate Professor at [[Columbia University]] School of Public Health. She sits on scientific and advisory committees for the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], and [[UNDP]]. She is Vice-Chair of the advisory committee of the Women's Rights Watch Project of [[Human Rights Watch]].<ref name=LP />

Toubia publishes on reproductive health, women's rights, and gender inequality, focussing on [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. Her publications include "Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Worldwide Laws and Policies," "Caring for Women with Circumcision: A Technical Manual for Health Care Providers," "Learning About Social Change: A Research and Evaluation Guidebook Using Female Circumcision as a Case Study," and "Female Genital Mutilation: A Call for Global Action."<ref name=LP />
