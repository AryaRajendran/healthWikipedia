The '''Pneumatic school''' of [[medicine]] (''Pneumatics'', or ''Pneumatici'', {{lang-el|Πνευματικοί}}) was an ancient school of medicine in [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]]. They were founded in [[Rome]] by [[Athenaeus of Cilicia]], in the 1st century AD.

The [[Roman era]] was a time when the [[Methodic school]] had enjoyed its greatest reputation, from which the Pneumatic school differed principally in that, instead of the mixture of primitive [[atoms]], they adopted an active principle of immaterial nature, ''[[Pneuma (ancient medicine)|pneuma]]'', or spirit. This principle was the cause of [[health]] and [[disease]]. It is from [[Galen]] that we learn the doctrines of the founder of the Pneumatic school.

==Doctrines==
[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] had already laid the foundations of the doctrine of ''pneuma'', for which, Aristotle was the first to describe the ways in which the ''pneuma'' is introduced into the body and the sanguineous system. The [[Stoics]] developed the theory even more and applied it to the functions of the body. [[Erasistratus]] and his successors had made the ''pneuma'' act a great part in health and disease. Thus, the theory of the ''pneuma'' was not a new one. The Methodic school, however, appears to have done away with much of the theory. The Pneumatic school, in choosing to oppose the Methodic school, adopted a firmly established principle, and chose the ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' principle of the Stoics.<ref>Galen, ''De Differeat Puls.'', iii</ref>

They thought that [[logic]] was indispensable to medicine, and Galen tells us that the Pneumatic school would rather have betrayed their country than renounce their opinions.<ref>Galen, ''De Differeat Puls.'', ii</ref> Athenaeus had also adopted much of the doctrines of the [[Peripatetics]],<ref>Galen, ''De Semiae'', ii</ref> and besides the doctrine of the ''pneuma'', he developed the theory of the [[classical elements|elements]] much more than the Methodic school had done. He recognised in the four elements the positive qualities (''poiotes'') of the animal body; but he often regarded them as real substances, and gave to the whole of them the name of ''Nature of Man''.<ref>Galen, ''De Element.'', i</ref> Although the Pneumatici attributed the majority of diseases to the ''pneuma'',<ref>Pseudo-Galen, ''Introd.''</ref> they nevertheless paid attention to the mixture of the elements. The union of [[heat]] and [[moisture]] was the most suitable for the preservation of health. Heat and dryness give rise to acute diseases, cold and moisture produce [[phlegmatic]] affections, cold and dryness give rise to [[melancholy]]. Everything dries up and becomes cold at the approach of [[death]].<ref>Galen, ''De Temperam.'', i.</ref>
