A '''glucagonoma''' is a rare [[tumor]] of the [[alpha cell]]s of the [[pancreas]] that results in up to a 1000-fold overproduction of the [[hormone]] [[glucagon]]. Alpha cell tumors are commonly associated with [[glucagonoma syndrome]], though similar symptoms are present in cases of [[pseudoglucagonoma syndrome]] in the absence of a glucagon-secreting tumor.

== History ==
Fewer than 251 cases of glucagonoma have been described in the literature since their first description by Becker in 1942. Because of its rarity (fewer than one in 20 million worldwide), long-term survival rates are as yet unknown.

== Symptoms ==
The primary [[physiology|physiological]] effect of glucagonoma is an overproduction of the [[peptide]] hormone [[glucagon]], which enhances [[blood glucose]] levels through the activation of anabolic and [[catabolism|catabolic]] processes including [[gluconeogenesis]] and [[lipolysis]] respectively. Gluconeogenesis produces [[glucose]] from [[protein]] and [[amino acid]] materials. It also increases [[lipolysis]], which is the breakdown of [[adipose tissue|fat]]. The net result is [[hyperglucagonemia]], decreased blood levels of [[amino acid]]s ([[hypoaminoacidemia]]), [[anemia]], [[diarrhea]], and weight loss of 5–15 kg.

[[Necrolytic migratory erythema]] (NME) is a classical symptom observed in patients with glucagonoma and is the presenting problem in 70% of cases.<ref name="pmid15538929">{{cite journal |author=van Beek AP, de Haas ER, van Vloten WA, Lips CJ, Roijers JF, Canninga-van Dijk MR |title=The glucagonoma syndrome and necrolytic migratory erythema: a clinical review |journal=Eur.

[[Diabetes mellitus]] also frequently results from the [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]] imbalance that occurs in glucagonoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koike N |title=Malignant glucagonoma of the pancreas diagnoses through anemia and diabetes mellitus |journal=Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=101–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12918465 |doi= |author-separator=, |author2=Hatori T |author3=Imaizumi T |last4=Harada |first4=N |last5=Fukuda |first5=A |last6=Takasaki |first6=K |last7=Iwamoto |first7=Y}}</ref> Diabetes mellitus is present in 80–90% of cases of glucagonoma, and is exacerbated by preexisting [[insulin resistance]].

== Diagnosis ==
A [[blood serum]] glucagon concentration of 1000 [[picogram|pg]]/[[milliliter|mL]] or greater is indicative of glucagonoma (the normal range is 50–200 pg/mL).

However, recent studies have shown that forty percent of patients have plasma glucagon levels ranging from 500 to 1000 pg/mL.  Increased levels have been reported in cases of [[renal insufficiency]], [[acute pancreatitis]], hypercorticism, [[hepatic]] diseases, severe [[stress (biological)|stress]], extended [[fasting]], and familial hyperglucagonemia.  Rarely do these cases result in levels over 500 pg/mL, except in the case of patients with hepatic diseases.<ref>Goldman, Lee, and Ausiello Dennis. Cecil Textbook of Medicine. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2004.</ref>

Blood tests may also reveal abnormally low concentrations of amino acids, [[zinc]], and [[essential fatty acid]]s, which are thought to play a role in the development of NME. Skin [[biopsy|biopsies]] may also be taken to confirm the presence of NME.

A [[complete blood count|CBC]] can uncover anemia, which is an abnormally low level of [[hemoglobin]].

The tumor itself may be localized by any number of radiographic modalities, including [[angiography]], [[computed tomography|CT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[positron emission tomography|PET]], and [[endoscopic ultrasound]]. [[Laparotomy]] is useful for obtaining [[histology|histologic]] samples for analysis and confirmation of the glucagonoma.

== Treatment ==
Heightened glucagon secretion can be treated with the administration of [[Somatostatin|octreotide, a somatostatin analog]], which inhibits the release of glucagon.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moattari AR, Cho K, Vinik AI |title=Somatostatin analogue in treatment of coexisting glucagonoma and pancreatic pseudocyst: dissociation of responses |journal=Surgery |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=581–7 |year=1990 |pmid=2168587 |doi=}}</ref> [[Doxorubicin]] and [[streptozotocin]] have also been used successfully to selectively damage alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. These do not destroy the tumor, but help to minimize progression of symptoms.

The only curative therapy for glucagonoma is [[surgery|surgical]] resection, where the tumor is removed. Resection has been known to reverse symptoms in some patients.
