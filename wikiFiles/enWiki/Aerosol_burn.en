An '''aerosol burn''' is an injury to the skin caused by the pressurized gas within an aerosol spray cooling quickly, with the sudden drop in temperature sufficient to cause [[frostbite]] to the applied area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bodyodd.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/08/02/4786089-brrrr-aerosol-sprays-are-a-silly-way-to-get-frostbite?lite |title=Brrrr! Aerosol sprays are a silly way to get frostbite - The Body Odd |publisher=Bodyodd.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> Medical studies have noted an increase of this practice, known as "frosting", in pediatric and teenage patients.<ref name=pmid20679305>{{cite journal |pmid=20679305 |year=2010 |last1=May |first1=U |last2=Stirner |first2=KH |last3=Lauener |first3=R |last4=Ring |first4=J |last5=Möhrenschlager |first5=M |title=Deodorant spray: A newly identified cause of cold burn |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=e716–8 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2936 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-10/deodorant-burns-on-the-increase/94912 |title=Deodorant burns on the increase - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> 

[[Adiabatic expansion]] causes the gas (with a low boiling temperature) to rapidly cool on exit from the aerosol applier. According to controlled laboratory experiments, the gas from a typical deodorant spray can drop up to sixty degrees Celsius.<ref name=pmid20679305/>

The form of injury is freezing of the skin, a type of frostbite. It is highly advised for those who suffer from frostbite to seek medical attention.<ref>http://www.electrolube.com/msds/001/001EAD.pdf</ref>

In rare cases aerosol-induced burns can be severe enough to necessitate [[skin graft]]ing.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |pmid=1745629 |year=1991 |last1=Lacour |first1=M |last2=Le Coultre |first2=C |title=Spray-induced frostbite in a child: A new hazard with novel aerosol propellants |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=207–9 |journal=Pediatric dermatology}}</ref>

== Causes ==
The most common cause of aerosol burns is patients' spaying deodorants for prolonged periods of time in close proximity to their skin. This practice is more common in younger persons such as teenagers and can be referred to as "frosting" or having a "frosty". Injuries such as these are often [[self-harm|self-inflicted]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] should be considered as an underlying cause.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18695608</ref>

=== Unintentional ===
A person can cause frostbite by accidental prolonged contact, using an aerosol on one place for too long.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014811/</ref> This is often done with [[deodorants]], but other products such as [[asthma inhaler]]s are also common causes of injury. Injuries are especially common with younger children who "try it out" not knowing all the possible [[dermatological]] effects. In rarer cases aerosol burns are reported to have been caused by [[air freshener]]s and other compressed aerosol canisters exploding.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237275/</ref><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9677032</ref>

=== Intentional and Abuse ===
[[Fluorinated hydrocarbon]] (fluorocarbon) aerosol propellants can be abused, as with solvents. A common form is [[huffing]] as a means of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]]. When inhaled, aerosols can cause the same frostbite as on other parts of the body.<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Fluorinated+hydrocarbon</ref><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10630273</ref> The [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) has published various resources on the internet warning of the effects of this abuse,  including content especially for teenagers and young people in apparent response to the increase in incidents in this age group.<ref>http://teens.drugabuse.gov/facts/facts_inhale1.php</ref><ref>http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=414</ref><ref>http://www.beachpsych.com/pages/cc23.html</ref>

Some aerosol burns are intentionally [[self-harm|self-inflicted]], the reasons being emotional/psychological. Household aerosol products such as air fresheners and deodorants can be a convenient, easily available means to satisfy the compulsions.

== Symptoms ==
Depending on the duration of exposure aerosol-induced frostbite can vary in depth. Most injuries of this type only affect the [[epidermis]], the outermost layer of skin. However, if contact with the aerosol is prolonged the skin will freeze further and deeper layers of tissue will be affected, causing a more serious burn that reaches the [[dermis]], destroys nerves, and increases the risk of [[infection]] and [[scarring]] .<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/frostbite/DS01164/DSECTION=complications|title=Frostbite: Complications|publisher= MayoClinic |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}</ref> When the skin thaws, [[pain]] and severe discomfort can occur in the affected area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000057.htm |title=Frostbite: Symptoms |publisher=nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}</ref> There may be a smell of aerosol products such as deodorant around the affected area, the injury may [[itch]] or be painful, the skin may freeze and become hardened, blisters may form on the area, and the flesh can become red and swollen.

== Treatment ==
[[File:Example of Postinflammatory hypopigmentation.jpg|thumb|An example of [[postinflammatory hypopigmentation]] (the light white patches) about one year after a severe aerosol burn.]]
Various methods of treatment are used, depending greatly on the length of exposure and other factors. There are documented cases using both conservative and invasive treatments, including skin grafting and/or the application of nonadhesive dressing alongside [[topical corticosteroids]] to reduce [[inflammation]]. In some patients [[postinflammatory hypopigmentation]] or [[hyperpigmentation]] may result in the months after initial injury, and ultraviolet protection such as [[sunscreen]] is essential to prevent an elevated risk of skin cancer in the damaged tissues.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/skin-cancer/about/skin-cancer-risks-and-causes</ref><ref>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/126/3/e716.full</ref> The pain caused by these burns is often intense and can be prolonged, making a [[pain management]] plan important. This often includes short term prescriptions of [[painkillers]].  

In the case of self-harm induced injury the underlying mental health aspects should be [[Self-harm#treatment|treated as with all self-inflicted injuries]].
