'''Emergency Medical Technician-Basic''' (EMT-B) is the entry level of [[Emergency Medical Technician]] (pre-hospital [[emergency medical provider]]) in the [[Emergency medical services in the United States|United States]]. 

EMT-Bs are not trained to provide definitive medical care, but instead focus on rapid in-field treatment and transport to higher medical providers. EMT-Bs work in conjunction with other medical providers such as [[paramedics]], [[nurses]], and [[physicians]], as well as with other EMT-Bs. When operating in the prehospital environment, their actions are governed by protocols and procedures set by their system's physician [[medical director]]. 

==Education and training==
EMT-B training is regulated at both the state and federal level. At the federal level, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) has developed a minimum content and hour requirement that all states must at least meet. This requirement is known as the ''National Standard Curriculum''.<ref name=NHTSA_NSC>{{cite web |url= http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/ems/pub/emtbnsc.pdf |title= Emergency Medical Technician-Basic National Standard Curriculum|accessdate=2008-03-10 |format= PDF|publisher= National Highway Transportaiton Safety Administration}}</ref> Under the NHTSA curriculum, students receive 110 hours of lecture and lab time covering anatomy, physiology, legal aspects of medical care, assessment, and treatment of [[medical emergency|medical]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[Emergency psychiatry|behavioral]], and [[obstetric]] emergencies. In addition to class time, the NHTSA recommends clinical rotations on board [[ambulances]] and in [[emergency departments]].

Using NHTSA guidelines, the [[National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]] have developed and implemented certification tests for the NHTSA EMT levels, including the EMT-Basic level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nremt.org/about/about_exams.asp |title=About NREMT Examinations |accessdate=2008-03-17 |format=HTML |publisher=National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071027161226/http://www.nremt.org/about/about_exams.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-27}}</ref> As of 2006, 39 US states utilize the NREMT EMT-Basic exam as part of the state licensing and/or certification procedure.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nremt.org/downloads/2006_Annual_Report.pdf|title= 2006 Annual Report|accessdate=2008-03-17 |format= PDF|publisher=National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians |pages=11|quote=50 states minus non-registry states minus paramedic only states |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009005320/http://www.nremt.org/downloads/2006_Annual_Report.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-09}}

Once certified, EMT-Basics are required to obtain continuing education hours to recertify. Recertification requirements vary from state to state. Continuing education courses can cover a variety of topics, provided that they cover relevant material, including college courses covering anatomy, physiology, or psychology, to more applied courses that are either standardized, such as a [[PHTLS|Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS)]], or tailored to the needs of an individual EMS system or region. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nremt.org/downloads/EMT.basic.pdf |title= EMT-Basic Re-registration Requirements|accessdate=2008-03-25 |format=PDF |publisher=National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Some states  allow for an already certified EMT from another state to apply for reciprocity in their state. Reciprocity allows, for example, an EMT-B from New Jersey to apply for an EMT-B certification in New York and be certified as a New York State EMT-B without taking the EMT course over again. The states that participate in this can be found by contacting the certification boards of each state or on their websites.

==Scope of practice==

<!-- Please avoid making a list of what Y OUR state lets EMT-Bs do. There should be enough examples to get across the point without an all encompassing list of what each of the 50 states allow or disallow -->

The scope of medical practice for EMT-Bs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among states as well as inside states. In general, EMT-Bs provide what is considered [[basic life support]] and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMT-Bs include [[CPR]], [[Automated external defibrillator|Automated external defibrillation]], mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as [[oropharyngeal airway|oropharyngeal]] and [[Nasopharyngeal airway|nasopharyngeal]] airways, pulse oximetry, glucometer, splinting (including spinal immobilization and [[traction splint]]s), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of preprescribed nitroglycerin, [[Metered-dose inhaler]] such as [[Salbutamol|albuterol]], epinephrine auto injectors such as the [[EpiPen]]. Non-preprescribed drugs include Oxygen via nasal canula up to non-rebreather and BVM (non-rebreather and BVM being high flow) depending on patient needs,oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction), and HazMat.<ref name=NHTSA_NSC/> 

Individually, each state is free to add or subtract to their EMT-Bs scope of practice as they please. For example, EMT-Bs working in California may not administer activated charcoal, an NHTSA approved intervention, under a standard certification. Local EMS systems (i.e. counties in California) can apply to the state to implement an extended scope of practice for EMT-Bs that includes activated charcoal as well as other pharmaceutical interventions not normally allowed to be administered by EMT-Bs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emsa.ca.gov/legislation/FinalApprovedChapter3242007.pdf |title=Emergency Medical Technician I |accessdate=2008-04-02 |format=PDF |publisher=California Emergency Medical Services Authority|pages=16 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
