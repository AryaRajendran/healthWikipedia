'''Clinical biophysics''' is that branch of [[medical science]] that studies the action process and the effects of [[Non-ionizing radiation|non-ionising physical energies]] utilised for therapeutic purposes.<ref>Aaron RK, Ciombor DM, Wang S, Simon B. Clinical biophysics: the promotion of skeletal repair by physical forces. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Apr;1068:513-31. Review.</ref><ref>Anbar, M. Clinical biophysics: A new concept in undergraduate medical education. J Medical Education, 56, 443â€“444 (1981)</ref> 
Physical energy can be applied for [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[therapeutic]] aims. 

The principle on which clinical biophysics is based are represented by the recognizability and the specificity of the physical signal applied:
* recognizability: the capacity of the biological target to recognise the presence of the physical energy: this aspect becomes more important with the lowering of the energy applied.
* specificity: the capacity of the physical agent applied to the biological target to obtain a response depending on its physical characteristics: frequency, length, energy, etc. The effects do not necessarily depend on the quantity of energy applied to the biological target.<ref>Roy K. Aaron, Mark E. Bolander, editors. Symposium of Physical Regulation of Skeletal Repair. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Rosemont, Illinois; 2005. p. 37-51.</ref>

== Definition ==
Several papers show that the response of a [[biological system]] when exposed to non-ionizing physical stimuli is not necessarily dependent on the amount of energy applied.{{fact|date = October 2011}}
Specific combinations of [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] and [[waveform]] may trigger the most intense response. For example, cell proliferation or activation of [[metabolic pathway]]s.
This has been demonstrated for:
:a) mechanical strains directly applied to the cells or tissue;
:b) mechanical energy applied by ultrasound;
:c) electromagnetic field exposure;
:d) electric field exposure.

Several pre-clinical experiences have laid the foundation to identify exposure conditions that may be used in humans to treat diseases or to promote tissue healing.<ref>Cadossi R, Caruso G, Setti S, Massari L. Fattori fisici di stimolazione ossea. Physical forces in bone stimulation. G.I.O.T. 2007;33(suppl. 1):S255-S261</ref>
The identification of the best parameters to apply in any particular circumstance is the current goal of [[research]] activities in the field.
