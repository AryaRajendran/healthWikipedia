[[File:Precuneus.png|thumb|alt=Sagittal MRI slice with the precuneus shown in red.|Sagittal MRI slice with the precuneus shown in red.]]
The '''precuneus''' is a part of the [[superior parietal lobule]] hidden in the [[medial longitudinal fissure]] between the two [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. It is sometimes described as the medial area of the superior [[parietal cortex]]. The precuneus is bounded anteriorly by the [[marginal sulcus|marginal branch]] of the [[cingulate sulcus]], posteriorly by the [[Parieto-occipital sulcus|parietooccipital sulcus]], and inferiorly by the [[subparietal sulcus]]. It is involved with [[episodic memory]], [[visuospatial]] processing, reflections upon [[Self (psychology)|self]], and aspects of [[consciousness]]. 

The location of the precuneus makes it difficult to study. Furthermore, it is rarely subject to isolated injury due to [[stroke]]s, or trauma such as gunshot wounds. This has resulted in it being "one of the less accurately mapped areas of the whole cortical surface".<ref name="Cavanna06"/>  While originally described as homogeneous by [[Korbinian Brodmann]], it is now appreciated to contain three subdivisions.<ref name="Margulies"/> 

It is also known after [[Achille-Louis Foville]] as the ''quadrate lobule of Foville''.<ref name="Cavanna06">{{cite journal |author=Cavanna A, Trimble M |title=The precuneus: a review of its functional anatomy and behavioural correlates |journal=Brain |volume=129 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=564–83 |year=2006 |pmid=16399806 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl004 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/129/3/564}}</ref><ref name="Cavanna"/><ref>Foville AL.

==Anatomy==
[[File:Precuneus animation small.gif|thumb|left|Precuneus of left cerebral hemisphere(shown in red).]]
[[Image:Precuneus connectivity new.gif|thumb|300px|Subdivisions of precuneus and posterior cingulate in the human based upon resting state functional connectivity.<ref name="Margulies"/> Blue is the Sensorimotor Anterior Region and its connections; green is the Cognitive/Associative Central Region; yellow is the Visual Posterior Region. (The red color shows the [[posterior cingulate]] and its connections.)]]
The precuneus is located on the inside between the two [[cerebral hemisphere]]s in the rear region between the [[somatosensory|somatosensory cortex]] and forward of the [[cuneus]] (which contains the [[visual cortex]]). It is above the [[posterior cingulate]]. Following [[Korbinian Brodmann]] it has traditionally been considered a homogeneous structure and with limited distinction between it and the neighboring [[posterior cingulate]] area. Brodmann mapped it as the medial continuation of lateral parietal [[Brodmann area 7|area 7]]. 

[[Anterograde tracing|Axon tracing]] research on [[macaque monkey]]s has established that it consists of three subdivisions which now have been confirmed by [[fMRI]] upon  resting-state [[Functional neuroimaging|functional connectivity]] to also exist in [[human]]s (parallel fMRI research has also been done upon monkeys).<ref name="Margulies">{{cite journal |author=Margulies DS, Vincent JL, Kelly C, Lohmann G, Uddin LQ, Biswal BB, Villringer A, Castellanos FX, Milham MP, Petrides M  |title=Precuneus shares intrinsic functional architecture in humans and monkeys |journal=PNAS |year=2009 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0905314106 |pmid=19903877 |volume=106 |issue=47 |pages=20069–74 |pmc=2775700 }}</ref>

===Three subdivisions===
;Sensorimotor Anterior Region
This occurs around the margin of the [[cingulate sulcus]]  (blue in figure) and is connected with sensorimotor areas of the cerebral cortex such as the [[paracentral lobule]], [[supplementary motor area]], [[premotor cortex]], [[somatosensory area]] ([[Brodmann area 2]]), [[parietal operculum]] and [[insular cortex|insula]]. fMRI Research upon humans finds a connection with the caudalmost part of [[parahippocampus]] and [[superior temporal gyrus]]. No connections with the [[inferior parietal lobule]], [[prefrontal cortex]] nor [[primary motor cortex]].

;Cognitive/Associative Central Region
This occurs around the precuneal sulcus (green in figure) and is connected with the [[inferior parietal lobule]] particularly the [[angular gyrus]] and prefrontal areas [[Brodmann area 10|10]], [[Brodmann area 46|46]] and [[Brodmann area 8|8]]. No connections exist with premotor, motor, or somatosensory areas. The areas with which it links are involved in [[executive functions]], [[working memory]] and [[motor control|motor planning]].

;Visual Posterior Region
This occurs along the parieto-occipital fissure (yellow in figure). This connects with visual areas in the [[cuneus]] and [[primary visual cortex]].

===Subcortical connections===
Below the cerebral cortex, the precuneus is connected  with the dorsalmost nuclei of the [[thalamus]], including the [[ventral lateral nucleus]], the central and anterior nuclei of the [[intralaminar nuclear group]],  and the lateral [[pulvinar]]. Other connections include the [[claustrum]], the dorsolateral [[caudate nucleus]], [[putamen]], and the [[zona incerta]].<ref name="Cavanna06"/><ref name="Cavanna"/> It also has links with the [[brainstem]] areas such as the [[pretectal area]], the [[superior colliculus]], the [[nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis]], and the [[basis pontis]].<ref name="Cavanna06"/><ref name="Cavanna"/>

==Evolution==
The precuneus seems to be a recently expanded part of the brain, as in less developed [[primate]]s such as [[New world monkey]]s "the superior parietal and precuneate regions are poorly developed".<ref name="Cavanna06"/> It has been noted that "the precuneus is more highly developed (i.e. comprises a larger portion of the brain volume) in human beings than in non-human primates or other animals, has the most complex columnar cortical organization and is among the last regions to myelinate".<ref name="Cavanna06"/>

== Functions ==

The [[mental imagery]] concerning the [[Self (psychology)|self]] has been located in the forward part of the precuneus with posterior areas being involved with [[episodic memory]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=P.C.|coauthors=Frith, C.D., Baker, S.C., Shallice, T., Frackowiak, R.S.J., Dolan, R.J.|title=The Mind's Eye--Precuneus Activation in Memory-Related Imagery|journal=Neuroimage|year=1995|volume=2|pages=195–200|pmid=9343602|doi=10.1006/nimg.1995.1025}}</ref> Another area has been linked to [[visuospatial]] imagery. (It is not though clear how these—and the functions noted below—link with the above three subdivisions.)

===Self===
[[Functional imaging]] has linked the precuneus to the processes involved in [[self-consciousness]], such as reflective self-awareness, that involve rating ones own personality traits compared to those judged of other people.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kjaer TW, Nowak M, Lou HC | year = 2002 | title = Reflective self-awareness and conscious states: PET evidence for a common midline parietofrontal core | url = | journal = Neuroimage | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 1080–6 | doi = 10.1006/nimg.2002.1230 | pmid = 12377180 }}</ref><ref name="Lou">{{cite journal | author=Lou HC, Luber B, Crupain M, Keenan JP, Nowak M, Kjaer TW, Sackeim HA, Lisanby SH |pmc=404216 | pmid = 15096584 |pages=6827–32 | year=2004 | title=Parietal cortex and representation of the mental Self. | volume=101 | issue=17 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0400049101 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}}</ref>

===Memory===
The precuneus is involved in memory tasks, such as when people look at images and try to respond based on what they have remembered in regard to verbal questions about their spatial details.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wallentin M, Roepstorff A, Glover R, Burgess N | year = 2006 | title = Parallel memory systems for talking about location and age in precuneus, caudate and Broca's region | url = | journal = Neuroimage | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 1850–64 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.002 | pmid = 16828565 }}</ref> It is involved with the left prefrontal cortex in the recall of [[episodic memories]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lundstrom BN, Petersson KM, Andersson J, Johansson M, Fransson P, Ingvar M | year = 2003 | title = Isolating the retrieval of imagined pictures during episodic memory: activation of the left precuneus and left prefrontal cortex | url = | journal = Neuroimage | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 1934–43 | pmid = 14683699 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.07.017 }}</ref> including past episodes related to the self.<ref name="Lou"/> The precuneus is also involved in [[Source amnesia|source memory]] (in which the "source" circumstances of a memory are recalled) with the left prefrontal cortex: here its role is suggested to be providing rich episodic contextual associations used by the prefrontal cortex to select the correct past memory.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lundstrom BN, Ingvar M, Petersson KM | year = 2005 | title = The role of precuneus and left inferior frontal cortex during source memory episodic retrieval | url = | journal = Neuroimage | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 824–34 | pmid = 15982902 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.05.008 }}</ref> In the recollection of memories, it has been suggested that the precuneus 'decides' whether  context information exists that can be useful for involving the aid of the [[hippocampus]].<ref name="Dörfel">{{cite journal |pmid = 1989556 | volume=51 | issue=2 | title=Delayed death from aortic root trauma | year=1991 | month=February | author=Boruchow IB, Hutchins GM | journal=Ann. Thorac. Surg. | pages=317–9}}</ref> Alternatively it has a different involvement when judging the familiarity as it decides whether the processing of perceptual features would be more useful.<ref name="Dörfel"/> In this way the precuneus gets involved in diverse processes such as attention, episodic memory retrieval, working memory and conscious perception.<ref name="Dörfel"/>

===Visuospatial ===
The precuneus has been suggested to be involved in directing attention in space both when an individual makes movements and when imaging or preparing them.<ref name="Cavanna06"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kawashima R, Roland PE, O'Sullivan BT | year = 1995 | title = Functional anatomy of reaching and visuomotor learning: a positron emission tomography study | url = | journal = Cereb Cortex | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 111–22 | pmid = 7620288 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/5.2.111 }}</ref> It is involved in motor imagery and shifting attention between motor targets.<ref name="Cavanna06"/> It is also involved in [[motor coordination]] that requires shifting attention to different spatial locations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wenderoth N, Debaere F, Sunaert S, Swinnen SP | year = 2005 | title = The role of anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus in the coordination of motor behaviour | url = | journal = Eur J Neurosci | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 235–46 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04176.x | pmid = 16029213 }}</ref> It is also together with the dorsal [[premotor cortex]] involved in [[visuospatial]] mental operations (such as in a modified form of the game of [[Amidakuji]]). It is suggested that while the premotor area engages in the mental operation, the precuneus aids monitoring the success of that operation in terms of internally represented visual images.<ref>Oshio R, Tanaka S, Sadato N, Sokabe M, Hanakawa T, Honda M. (2010). Differential effect of double-pulse TMS applied to dorsal premotor cortex and precuneus during internal operation of visuospatial information. {{doi|10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.034}} Neuroimage. 49(1):1108-15. PMID  19632337</ref>

The precuneus role in mental imagery has been suggested to extend  to that of modeling other people's views. It is activated when a person takes a third-person versus first-person visual point of view.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vogeley K, May M, Ritzl A, Falkai P, Zilles K, Fink GR | year = 2004 | title = Neural correlates of first-person perspective as one constituent of human self-consciousness | url = | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 16 | issue = 5| pages = 817–27 | pmid = 15200709 | doi = 10.1162/089892904970799 }}</ref> Together with the [[superior frontal gyrus]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is activated when people make judgments that requires understanding whether to act out of [[empathy]] and [[forgiveness]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Farrow TF, Zheng Y, Wilkinson ID, Spence SA, Deakin JF, Tarrier N, Griffiths PD, Woodruff PW | year = 2001 | title = Investigating the functional anatomy of empathy and forgiveness | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 2433–8 | pmid = 11496124 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200108080-00029 }}</ref>

===Consciousness===
It has been suggested that together with the posterior cingulate, that the precuneus is "pivotal for conscious information processing".<ref name="Vogt">{{cite journal | pmc=2679949 | pmid = 16186025 |author=Vogt BA, Laureys S | year=2005 | title=Posterior cingulate, precuneal and retrosplenial cortices: cytology and components of the neural network correlates of consciousness | volume=150 | pages=205–17 | doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(05)50015-3 | journal=Progress in brain research}}</ref> The evidence for this link with [[consciousness]] comes from the effects of its disruption in [[epilepsy]], [[stroke|brain lesion]]s and [[vegetative state]].<ref name="Cavanna">{{cite journal | url = http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1130 | pmid = 17603406 | author=Cavanna AE | year = 2007 | title = The precuneus and consciousness | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 545–52 | journal = CNS spectrums }}</ref><ref name="Vogt"/> Also cerebral glucose metabolism has its highest levels in these two areas in [[wakefulness]] but is most reduced during [[anesthesia]] in them.<ref name="Cavanna"/><ref name="Vogt"/> In addition, it is one of the areas of the brain most deactivated during [[slow-wave sleep]] and [[rapid eye movement sleep]].<ref name="Cavanna"/>

Together with the prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, is more activated upon the learning of words briefly flashed when they are supraliminal (and so enter consciousness) than [[Subliminal message|subliminal]] (and so do not enter consciousness).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kjaer TW, Nowak M, Kjaer KW, Lou AR, Lou HC | year = 2001 | title = Precuneus-prefrontal activity during awareness of visual verbal stimuli | url = | journal = Conscious Cogn. | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 356–65 | pmid = 11697869 |doi=10.1006/ccog.2001.0509}}</ref>

===Default network===
It has been suggested to be the 'core node' or 'hub' of the [[default mode network]] that is activated during "resting consciousness" in which people do not engage intentionally in sensory or motor activity.<ref name="Cavanna"/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 1859877 | volume=78 | issue=3 | title=Multidrug resistance (mdr1) gene expression in adult acute leukemias: correlations with treatment outcome and in vitro drug sensitivity | year=1991 | month=August | author=Marie JP, Zittoun R, Sikic BI | journal=Blood | pages=586–92}}</ref> This involvement in the default network is suggested to underlie its role in [[self-consciousness]]. However its involvement in the default network has been questioned.<ref name="Margulies"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Buckner RL, Andrews-Hanna JR, Schacter DL | year = 2008 | title = The brain's default network: anatomy, function, and relevance to disease | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1124 | issue = | pages = 1–38 | pmid = 18400922 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1440.011 }}</ref>  Though one of the authors raising these doubts noted "our findings in this regard should be treated as preliminary."<ref name="Margulies"/>  A recent study showed that only ventral precuneus involved in the default network.<ref>{{cite journal | volume=59 | issue=4 | title=Functional connectivity mapping of the human precuneus by resting state fMRI | year=2012 | month=February | author=Zhang S, Li CS | journal=NeuroImage | pages=3548–3562 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.11.023}}</ref>

=== Parietal prefrontal central hub===
[[Olaf Sporns]] and Ed Bullmore have proposed that its functions link to its role as a central and well connected "[[small-world network]]" hub between parietal and prefrontal regions. 
<blockquote>These clusters or modules are interlinked by specialized hub regions, ensuring that overall path lengths across the network are short. Most studies identified [such] hubs among parietal and prefrontal regions, providing a potential
explanation for their well-documented activation by many cognitive functions. Particularly notable is the prominent structural role of the precuneus, a region that is homologous to the highly connected posteromedial cortex in the macaque. The precuneus
is involved in self-referential processing, imagery and memory, and its deactivation is associated with anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness. An intriguing hypothesis suggests that these functional aspects can be explained on the basis of its high centrality in the cortical network.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bullmore E, Sporns O | year = 2009 | title = Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems | url = | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 186–98 | pmid = 19190637 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2575 }}</ref>
