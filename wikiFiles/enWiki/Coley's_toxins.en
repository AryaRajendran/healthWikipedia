== History ==
Observations of a relationship between infection and cancer regression date back to at least the 18th century.<ref name=Hobohm1>Hobohm, U.: ''[http://bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de/cancer/hobohm-2001-cii.pdf]'' ''Fever and cancer in perspective'', Cancer Immunol Immunother 2001) 50: 391–396  10.1007/s002620100216</ref><ref name="pmid11812185">{{cite journal |author=Hoption Cann SA, van Netten JP, van Netten C, Glover DW |title=Spontaneous regression: a hidden treasure buried in time |journal=Med.

Coley started his investigations after the death of one of his first patients, Elizabeth Dashiell, from [[sarcoma]]. Dashiell was a close childhood friend of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], who later indicated that her death was what first motivated his subsequent funding of cancer research.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hall-commotion.html |title=A Commotion in the Blood |accessdate=2007-11-10 |work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-8050-5841-9">{{cite book |author=Hall, Stephen K. |title=A commotion in the blood: life, death, and the immune system |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-8050-5841-9 |doi=}}</ref>

Frustrated by this case, Coley's subsequent research led him to find evidence of the apparent relationship between infection and cancer regression, which he published in 1891.<ref>[http://www.ralphmoss.com/html/coley.pdf "The Cancer Chronicles", Ralph W.

Roger indicating that this combination led to greater virulence.<ref>Roger, G.H. Séances et Mém Soc de Biol Paris 1890;2:573–580</ref>

The so-called Coley's Toxins were used against different types of cancer from the year 1893<ref>Coley WB. The treatment of malignant tumors by repeated inoculations of Erysipelas, with a report of ten original cases. Am J Med Sci 1893;105:487–511.</ref> through the year 1963. From 1923 on, [[Parke-Davis]] was the only source of Coley's Toxins in the [[United States]]. In the wake of the [[thalidomide]] controversy and the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] of 1962, Coley's Toxins were assigned "new drug" status by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), making it illegal to prescribe them outside of [[clinical trial]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISW/is_251/ai_n6112670/pg_13 |title=Coley's Toxins – The First Century Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients – Find Articles |accessdate=2007-11-10 |work=Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients | year=2004}}</ref> Since then, several small clinical trials have been conducted with mixed results.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-labbox18feb18,1,2366354.story Treatment pioneer], from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', published February 18, 2008. Accessed March 26, 2008.</ref>

Coley's Toxins were also produced by the small German pharmaceutical company ''Südmedica''<ref name="isbn0-8147-3562-2">{{cite book |author=Hess, J David. |title=Can bacteria cause cancer?: alternative medicine confronts big science |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-8147-3562-2 |doi= |page=11}}</ref> and sold under the trade name ''Vaccineurin''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=eurekah.section.59582 |title=History and Background |accessdate=2007-11-10 |work=}}</ref> However, production ceased by 1990 because of a lack of re-approval by German [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices]].

== Rationale ==
There are multiple rationales proposed for how Coley's toxins affect the patient.

=== Macrophages ===
One rationale argues that [[macrophage]]s are either in "repair mode", furthering the growing of cancer, or in "defense mode", destroying cancer. However, macrophages are in "defense mode" only if there is some recognized enemy. As cancer tissue is not recognized as enemy (but as normal body tissue), there is a need to bring more macrophages into "defense mode" by simulating an [[infection]]. The simulated infection results in a real [[fever]]. Unlike [[hyperthermia]], real fever not only means heating of the body but also higher activity of the [[immune system]]. Thus, fever is seen as a precondition for a therapy using Coley's Toxins to succeed.<ref name=Hobohm1/><ref name="bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de">Hobohm, U.: ''[http://bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de/cancer/hobohm-2005-bjc.pdf]'' ''Fever therapy revisited'', British Journal of Cancer (2005) 92, 421 – 425</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoption Cann S, van Netten J, van Netten C |title=Dr William Coley and tumour regression: a place in history or in the future |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=79 |issue=938 |pages=672–80 |year=2003 |pmid=14707241 |pmc=1742910}} [http://pmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/79/938/672 link]</ref>

=== Tumor Necrosis Factor and Interleukin ===
One of the agents in Coley's Toxin that is thought to be biologically active is a [[lipopolysaccharide]] which causes fever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=eurekah.section.59631 |title=Proposed Mechanism of Action |accessdate=2007-11-10 |work=}}</ref>  The resulting fever from the lipopolysaccaride is thought to increase lymphocyte activity and boosts [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha|tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF). Tsung and Norton in ''Surgical Oncology'' reported that the active agent was thought to be [[interleukin-12]], rather than TNF.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tsung K, Norton JA |title=Lessons from Coley's Toxin |journal=Surgical oncology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=25–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16814541 |doi=10.1016/j.suronc.2006.05.002}}</ref>

=== Streptokinase ===
Another hypothesis argues that [[streptokinase]] (produced by bacteria of type "streptococcus" together with [[plasminogen]] from the patient) is the [[active agent]] of Coley's toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zacharski L, Sukhatme V |title=Coley's toxin revisited: immunotherapy or plasminogen activator therapy of cancer? |journal=J Thromb Haemost |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=424–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15748226 |doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01110.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid11469250">{{cite journal |author=Haux J |title=Infection and cancer |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9276 |pages=155–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11469250 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05369-7}}</ref> This hypothesis is supported by the fact that streptokinase has been associated with successful treatment of [[thromboangiitis obliterans]].<ref name="pmid8473086">{{cite journal |author=Hussein EA, el Dorri A |title=Intra-arterial streptokinase as adjuvant therapy for complicated Buerger's disease: early trials |journal=International surgery |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=54–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8473086 |doi=}}</ref>

=== Anti-angiogenesis ===
In addition to the mechanisms above, Coley's toxins might be [[antiangiogenic]] – suppressing the formation of new blood vessels which are vital to the growth of tumors.,<ref>[http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/1359-6101/PIIS1359610102000710.pdf Infection and cancer: the common vein]</ref> however, angiogenesis is not a biochemical cause by itself but needs external triggers.

=== Dendritic cells ===
A robust fever, which occurs in response to Coley fluid, generates inflammatory factors with co-stimulatory activity, which activate resting [[dendritic cell]]s (DC), leading to the activation of anergic T cells, maybe accomplished by a second process, where a possible physical damage of cancer cells leads to a sudden supply of cancer antigens to DC.,<ref name="Hobohm1"/><ref name="bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de"/>

=== PAMP ===
Recently (2008), an immunological explanation binding together immunological data with findings about spontaneous regression and epidemiological data indicating a lowered risk to develop cancer later after common infections, has been published.<ref name=Hobohm>Hobohm U, Grange J, Stanford J: ''[http://bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de/cancer/hobohm-2008-cri-pamp.pdf]'' ''Pathogen associated molecular pattern in cancer immunotherapy'', Critical Reviews Immunology (2008) Vol 28, 95–107</ref> According to this hypothesis, pathogenic substances produced by bacteria, viruses, infectious fungi and other pathogens, but not human tissue, called 'pathogen associated molecular pattern' ([[PAMP]]) lead to activation and maturation of tumor-antigen loaded dendritic cells.  One PAMP thought to play a major role is the [[CpG Oligodeoxynucleotide|unmethlyated CpG motif]] found in bacterial DNA.  The CpG motif is recognized by toll like receptor 9 ([[TLR9]]) and can induce a strong [[T helper cell|TH1]] response.

=== Germany ===
Some specialized medical doctors in Germany apply Coley's toxins to patients. They can do so legally because, in Germany, unapproved medications may be produced, although they may not be sold or given away. Physicians can go to special [[laboratories]] and produce Coley's toxins there using their own hands. Coley's toxins may still be applied by a licensed medical doctor, because in Germany there is "''[[:de:Therapiefreiheit|Therapiefreiheit]]''" ("[[therapy freedom]]"), the legal right to apply whichever therapy a physician considers to be appropriate in the light of their medical knowledge. For example, Dr  [[Josef Issels]] used several unconventional and controversial treatments, including Coley's toxins, for cancer patients in the second half of the 20th century.

This kind of therapy is offered as ''"Fiebertherapie"'' ([[fever therapy]]). [[Hyperthermia therapy]] or [[thermotherapy]] is not the same type of treatment, although sometimes incorrectly called "fever therapy".{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Name ==
There are several names for ''Coley's toxins'' or ''Coley's vaccine''. The reason may lie in the difficulty of classifying such a substance under the view of the established medicine:
* ''Coley's vaccine'' is not a [[vaccine]] in the usual sense, namely that it prevents an infection. Rather than that, it triggers infection-like reactions. However, ''Coley's vaccine'' may work like many ordinary [[vaccine]]s: it induces an immune response, in this case against the cancer.  In this sense, it predates current attempts to develop [[cancer vaccine]]s.
* The term [[toxin]] is applied as Coley's toxins contain both [[endotoxin]]s and [[exotoxin]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Politics ==

According to an article in the ''Iowa Orthopedic Journal'', Coley's toxins were opposed by the medical establishment despite his reports of good results, because his reports were not believed to be credible.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1888599|title=The Toxins of William B.
