This is associated with increased [[stroke volume]] of the [[left ventricle]] and decrease in the [[peripheral resistance]] leading to the widened [[pulse pressure]] of [[aortic regurgitation]].

==Eponym==

"Watson's water hammer pulse" and "Corrigan's pulse" refer to similar observations. However, the former usually refers to measurement of a pulse on a limb, while the latter refers to measurement of the pulse of the [[carotid artery]].<ref name="pmid18480541"/>

* "Corrigan's pulse" is named for Sir [[Dominic Corrigan]], the Irish physician, who characterized it in 1832.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3006}}</ref><ref>D. J. Corrigan. On permanent patency of the mouth of the aorta, or inadequacy of the aortic valves. The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, 1832, 37: 225-245.</ref>

* "Watson's water hammer pulse" is named for [[Thomas Watson (physician)|Thomas Watson]], who characterized it in 1844.<ref name="pmid18480541"/>

==Observation==
To feel a water hammer pulse: with the patient reclining, the examiner raises the patient's arm vertically upwards. The examiner grasps the muscular part of the patient's forearm. A water hammer pulse is felt as a tapping impulse which is transmitted through the bulk of the muscles. This happens because the blood that is pumped to the arm during systole is emptied very quickly due to the gravity effect on the raised arm. This results in the artery emptying back into the heart during diastole, therefore causing a palpable pulse.

==Causes==
Water hammer pulse is commonly found when a patient has in [[aortic regurgitation]]. A more comprehensive list of causes follows:

1. Physiological
* [[Fever]]
* [[Pregnancy]]
2. Cardiac lesions
* [[Aortic regurgitation]]
* [[Patent ductus arteriosus]]
* [[Systolic hypertension]]
* [[Bradycardia]]
* [[Aortopulmonary window]]
* [[Rupture of sinus of Valsalva into heart chambers]]
3. Syndromes or High output states
* [[Anemia]]
* [[Cor pulmonale]]
* [[Cirrhosis of liver]]
* [[Beriberi]]
* [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
* [[Arteriovenous fistula]]
* [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]''' 
4. Other causes
* [[Chronic alcoholism]]
