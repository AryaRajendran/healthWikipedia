The '''islets of Langerhans''' are the regions of the [[pancreas]] that contain its [[endocrine]] (i.e., hormone-producing) cells. Discovered in 1869 by [[Germans|German]] pathological anatomist [[Paul Langerhans]] at the age of 22,<ref>{{Cite journal

== Anatomy and histology ==

There are about one million islets distributed throughout the pancreas of a healthy adult human,<ref name=Sleisenger>{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=edited by Mark Feldman, Lawrence S.

Brandt; consulting editor, Marvin H.|title=Sleisenger & Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, management|year=2009|publisher=MD Consult|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-1-4160-6189-2|edition=9th}}</ref><sup>:914</sup> each of which measures about 0.2&nbsp;mm in diameter.<ref name=Sleisenger /><sup>:914</sup> Each is separated from the surrounding pancreatic tissue by a thin fibrous connective tissue capsule which is continuous with the fibrous connective tissue that is interwoven throughout the rest of the pancreas.<ref name=Sleisenger /><sup>:914</sup> The combined mass of the islets is 1 to 1.5&nbsp;grams.

===Cell types===
Hormones produced in the islets of Langerhans are secreted directly into the blood flow by (at least) five different types of cells. In rat islets, endocrine cell subsets are distributed as follows:<ref name="pmid7559135">{{Cite journal

* [[PP cell]]s (gamma cells) producing [[pancreatic polypeptide]] (3–5%)

In particular, while rodent islets are characterized by a predominant proportion of insulin-producing beta cells in the core of the cluster and by scarce alpha, delta and PP cells in the periphery, human islets display alpha and beta cells in close relationship with each other throughout the cluster.<ref name="pmid15923354"/><ref name="pmid16461897"/>

Islets can influence each other through [[paracrine]] and [[autocrine]] communication, and beta cells are coupled electrically to other beta cells (but not to other cell types).

==Paracrine feedback==
The paracrine feedback system of the islets of Langerhans has the following structure:<ref name="isbn0-683-30603-0">{{Cite book

==Islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes==
Islet transplantation has the possibility of restoring beta cell function from [[diabetes]], offering an alternative to a complete [[pancreas transplantation]] or an [[artificial pancreas]].

Because the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans are selectively destroyed by an autoimmune process in [[type 1 diabetes]], clinicians and researchers are actively pursuing [[islet transplantation]] as a means of restoring physiological beta cell function in patients with type 1 diabetes.<ref name="pmid18081223">{{Cite journal

Recent clinical trials have shown that insulin independence and improved metabolic control can be reproducibly obtained after transplantation of cadaveric donor islets into patients with [[Brittle diabetes|unstable type 1 diabetes]].<ref name="pmid17981623"/>

Islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes currently requires potent [[immunosuppression]] to prevent host [[rejection]] of donor islets.<ref name="pmid18337609">{{Cite journal

An alternative source of [[beta cell]]s, such insulin-producing cells derived from [[adult stem cell]]s or [[progenitor cell]]s would contribute to overcoming the current shortage of donor organs for transplantation.  The field of regenerative medicine is rapidly evolving and offers great hope for the nearest future.  However, type 1 diabetes is the result of the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas. Therefore, an effective cure will require a sequential, integrated approach that combines adequate and safe immune interventions with beta cell regenerative approaches.<ref name="pmid17130583">{{Cite journal

Another potential source of [[beta cell]]s may be [[xenotransplantation]]. The most likely source for xenogeneic islets for transplantation into human currently under evaluation is the pig pancreas.  Interestingly, human and porcine insulin differ only for one amino acid, and insulin extracted from porcine pancreata has been used for the treatment of patients with diabetes before the development of recombinant human insulin technology.  Several studies in small and large animals models have shown that transplantation of islet cells across species is possible.  However, several problems need to be overcome for porcine islet transplantation to become a viable clinical option. The '''immunogenicity''' of xenogeneic tissues may be different from and even stronger than allogeneic tissues.  For instance, Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (alpha galactosidase, [[alpha-Gal]]) expressed on porcine cells represents a major barrier to xenotransplantation being the target of preformed antibodies present in human blood. Remarkable progress has been recorded in the development of genetically modified pigs lacking or overexpressing molecules that may improve acceptance of transplanted tissues across into humans. Pigs lacking alpha-Gal or overexpressing [[human Decay Accelerating Factor]] (hDAF), amongst others, have been generated to study the impact on transplanted outcome in nonhuman primate models. Another possible antigenic target is the Hanganutziu-Deichter antigen, a sialic acid found in pigs and not humans, which may contribute to immunogenicity of porcine islets. Another limitation is the risk for transmission of '''zoonotic infections''' from pigs to humans, particularly from [[Porcine Endogenous Retro-Viruses]] (PERV). Amongst the approaches proposed to overcome islet xenorejection is '''[[immunoisolate|immunoisolation]]''' of the clusters using encapsulation techniques that may shield them from immune attack.  Studies in rodents and large animals have shown great promise that justify cautious optimism for the near future.  Nonrandomized, uncontrolled pilot clinical trials are current ongoing in subject with insulin-requiring diabetes to test the efficacy of encapsulation techniques to protect xenogeneic islets in the absence of chronic anti-rejection drugs.
