'''Kermit Barron Gosnell''' (born February 9, 1941) is an [[American people|American]] [[physician]] who practiced as an [[abortionist|abortion provider]] in [[Philadelphia]] and nearby states between 1972 and 2011; and as of April 2013 is on trial for [[first degree murder|first]] and [[third degree murder]], [[Controlled substance|illegal prescribing]] of drugs, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] related to [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|corruption]], and [[abortion law|illegal abortions]] and related [[medical malpractice]] offenses, at his abortion practice.<ref name="grandjury2011">{{cite web |url=http://phila.gov/districtattorney/PDFs/GrandJuryWomensMedical.pdf |title=Report of the Grand Jury, Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania |date=January 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania]] |archiveurl=http://www.scribd.com/doc/135646678/Grand-Jury-Report-Kermit-Gosnell-Womens-Medical |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Gosnell was arrested in January 2011 and charged—along with other crimes and various co-defendant employees—with eight counts of [[murder]] resulting from gross [[medical malpractice]] in treatment of patients at his clinics.  The murder charges related to a patient who died while under his care and seven newborns said to [[Infanticide|have been killed]] after being [[Born alive rule|born alive]] during attempted abortions. Through his lawyer, Gosnell denied the allegations.

The charges of murder was recommended by a [[grand jury]] against Gosnell and several employees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/grandJury_WomensMedical.html |title=Investigation of the Women's Medical Society Grand Jury Report |date=October 16, 2012 |publisher=[[District Attorney of Philadelphia]]}}</ref> [[CNN]] reported in March 2011 that prosecutors were considering seeking the [[death penalty]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-02/justice/pennsylvania.abortion.doctor_1_women-s-medical-society-kermit-gosnell-karnamaya-mongar |publisher=CNN |title=Prosecutors considering death penalty in abortion doctor case |first=Sarah |last=Hoye |date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> Before the trial opened, all defendants apart from Gosnell and one other had already pled guilty to similar charges (including for some, charges of third degree murder); several had testified to "snipping" the [[spinal chord|spines]] of babies.

In the same year, he also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental "[[Super Coil]]" method invented by [[Harvey Karman]].

The 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a "respected man" in his community, a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's "Young Philadelphian of the Year" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.<ref name="philly72" /> By the late 1980s however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.<ref name="philly72" />

Gosnell has been married three times.

:* Around 1996 - [[Pediatrician]] Dr Schwartz - the former head of adolescent services at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] and as of 2010, Philadelphia’s [[health commissioner]] - testified in the 2010 hearing that around 1996 or 1997 he had hand-delivered a letter of complaint about Gosnell's practice to the Secretary of Health’s office and stopped referring patients to the clinic, but received no response.<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|143-145}} 
:* 2000 - [[Civil lawsuit]] filed on behalf of the children of Semika Shaw, who had called the clinic the day after an abortion to report heavy bleeding, and died 3 days later of a perforated uterus and a bloodstream infection.

===2010 raid ===
The Women’s Medical Society was raided on 18 February 2010 under a [[search warrant]] by investigators from the [[FBI]] and state police. The raid was the result of a months-long investigation by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[Philadelphia Police Department]], and the State's [[Dangerous Drug-Offender Unit]] into suspected illegal drug prescription use at the practice. The investigation had also revealed the suspicious death of patient Karnamaya Mongar in 2009, which had in turn brought to light further information about unsanitary operations, use of untrained staff, and use of powerful drugs without proper medical supervision and control. As a result, when the February 2010 raid took place, staff from the Pennsylvania Department of State and Pennsylvania Department of Health also attended, as these issues were under their remit:<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|19-20}}

: "When the team members entered the clinic, they were appalled, describing it to the Grand Jury as 'filthy,' 'deplorable,' 'disgusting,' 'very unsanitary, very outdated, horrendous,' and 'by far, the worst' that these experienced investigators had ever encountered. There was blood on the floor. A stench of urine filled the air. A flea-infested cat was wandering through the facility, and there were cat feces on the stairs. Semi-conscious women scheduled for abortions were moaning in the waiting room or the recovery room, where they sat on dirty recliners covered with blood-stained blankets. All the women had been sedated by unlicensed staff – long before Gosnell arrived at the clinic – and staff members could not accurately state what medications or dosages they had administered to the waiting patients. Many of the medications in inventory were past their expiration dates ... surgical procedure rooms were filthy and unsanitary ... resembling 'a bad gas station restroom.' Instruments were not sterile. Equipment was rusty and outdated. Oxygen equipment was covered with dust, and had not been inspected. The same corroded suction tubing used for abortions was the only tubing available for oral airways if assistance for breathing was needed..."<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|20-21}}

: "[F]etal remains [were] haphazardly stored throughout the clinic– in bags, milk jugs, orange juice cartons, and even in cat-food containers ... Gosnell admitted to Detective Wood that at least 10 to 20 percent ... were probably older than 24 weeks [the legal limit] ... In some instances, surgical incisions had been made at the base of the fetal skulls. The investigators found a row of jars containing just the severed feet of fetuses. In the basement, they discovered medical waste piled high. The intact 19-week fetus delivered by Mrs. Mongar three months earlier was in a freezer. In all, the remains of 45 fetuses were recovered ... at least two of them, and probably three, had been viable."<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|20-21}}

=== 2011 arrest ===
Gosnell was arrested on January 19, 2011, five days after the certification of the Grand Jury's report. He was charged with eight counts of murder.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |first=Elaine |last=Quijano |authorlink=Elaine Quijano |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=Abortion Doc Charged with Eight Counts of Murder |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/19/national/main7261741.shtml |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref> Prosecutors allege that he killed seven babies born alive by severing their spinal cords with scissors, and that he was also responsible for the death in 2009 of Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old refugee from [[Bhutan]],<ref name="ABCgo"/> who died in his care. Gosnell's wife, Pearl, and eight other suspects were also arrested in connection with the case.<ref name="Details"/><ref name="ABCgo"/><ref name="CBS"/> The Drug Enforcement Administration, The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Inspector General also sought a 23-count indictment charging Gosnell and seven members of his former staff with drug conspiracy, relating to the practice's illegally prescribing highly-addictive painkillers and sedatives outside the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose. 

:* The [[third degree murder]] charge relates to Karnamaya Mongar; according to prosecutors, Gosnell's staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers. Gosnell's lawyer asserts that Karnamaya Mongar also had other drugs in her system that did not come from Gosnell's clinic, and that none of the infants were born alive.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{Cite news |first=Maryclaire |last=Dale |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10707568 |title=Doc disputes 'killings' at Philly abortion clinic |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref> The claim was rejected by the Grand Jury, based upon [[expert testimony]] that "it was the overdose of Demerol, not some mystery pill, that killed Mrs. Mongar."<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|231}} 

:* The seven other murder charges are all of [[first degree murder]]; they relate to babies, whom staff have testified they saw move or cry after complete birth, and whose deaths are alleged to have resulted from subsequent lethal action. They arise because of the "[[born alive rule]]", a principle of [[common law]] which stipulates that [[legal presumption|by default]], for legal purposes, personhood arises - and therefore unlawful killing constituting murder becomes possible - immediately upon the victim's being born alive. (Several US states as well as Federal legislation have more specific laws to protect fetuses and newborn babies, see ''[[fetal rights]]'' and ''[[born alive laws in the United States]]''). Steven Massof, a clinic employee who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2011, testified that he (Massof) had snipped the spines of more than 100 babies after they had been born alive, and that this was considered "standard procedure" at the clinic; a number of other employees had also testified to the same point.<ref name="snipping"/> No physical evidence exists for five of the seven cases — charges are based on staff testimony and denied by Gosnell. A photograph exists of the sixth, who allegedly had a gestational age of 30 weeks, and the physical remains were obtained of the seventh.<ref name="guardian.co.uk" /> The Grand Jury report states that, ''"A medical expert with 43 years of experience in performing abortions was appalled. This expert told us, 'I’ve never heard of it [cutting the spinal cord] being done during an abortion'."''<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|223}}

The [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] also alleges that Gosnell's former office staff at Family and Women's Medical Society (WMS) ran a prescription "pill mill." From June 2008 through February 18, 2010, Gosnell allegedly engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise by writing and dispensing fraudulent prescriptions for thousands of pills of the frequently-abused tablets [[OxyContin]], [[Percocet]], and [[Xanax]], and the frequently-abused syrups [[Phenergan]] and [[Promethazine]] with [[Codeine]].  Authorities further allege that Gosnell and his staff allowed customers to purchase multiple prescriptions under multiple names. For the first office visit, Gosnell allegedly charged $115, but that increased around December 2009 when he allegedly increased the initial office visit fee to $150. Staff at the clinic went from writing several hundred prescriptions for controlled substances per month filled at pharmacies in 2008 to over 2,300 filled at pharmacies in January 2010. Gosnell, with the assistance of his staff, is said to have distributed and dispensed more than 500,000 pills containing [[oxycodone]]; more than 400,000 pills containing alprazolam; and more than 19,000 ounces of cough syrup containing codeine.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/pae/News/2011/Dec/gosnell_release.htm |date=December 14, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] |title=Philadelphia Doctor Charged With Running Pill Mill |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref>

Gosnell's lawyer states that "Everybody's made him the butcher, this, that and the other thing without any trial, without anything being exposed to the public and everybody's found him guilty, that's not right".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/17529873/gosnell-case-heading-right-to-trial |title=Gosnell Case Heading Right To Trial |publisher=[[WTXF-TV]] |location=[[Philadelphia, PA]] |date=February 9, 2011}}</ref> He accused the government of a "lynching" and stated, "This is a targeted, elitist and racist prosecution of a doctor who's done nothing but give (back) to the poor and the people of West Philadelphia."<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>

=== Cases cited in the media ===
Examples of cases cited in the media include:

:* Girl age 15, accompanied by relative (1998): said to have told Gosnell she changed her mind about the abortion once inside the practice. Gosnell allegedly got upset, ripped off the patient's clothing, and forcibly restrained her.

Brenda Green, executive director of CHOICE, a nonprofit that connects the underinsured and uninsured with health services, told [[Katha Pollitt]] of ''[[The Nation]]'' that "it tried to report complaints from clients, but the department wouldn’t accept them from a third party. Instead, the patients had to fill out a daunting five-page form, available only in English, that required them to reveal their identities upfront and be available to testify in Harrisburg. Even with CHOICE staffers there to help, only two women agreed to fill out the form, and both decided not to submit it. The Department of State and the Philadelphia Public Health Department also had ample warning of dire conditions and took no action." <ref name=autogenerated3 />

=== Grand Jury report ===

The Grand Jury published their 280 page report in January 2011. They stated that, while some might see the issue and case through the lens of pro- and anti-abortion politics, it was in reality:
: "not about that controversy; it is about disregard of the law and disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants. We find common ground in exposing what happened here, and in recommending measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again."<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|1}}

The grand jury concluded that the practice was a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|corrupt organization]] within the meaning of [[racketeering]] law, based upon what they considered evidence of deliberate "standard" use of "bogus" doctors, falsification of records, grossly unprofessional procedures with little or no regard for human life, and flagrant disregard for medical and abortion laws and their consequences. Key findings included:

; Practice conditions and procedures
:* Extreme unsanitary conditions, including [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s, [[septic]] (unsterile) conditions, blood and animal [[feces]] and [[urine]] and other noxious fluids and waste, and months-old fetal remains stored in "jars, bags and jugs";<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|1-2, 236-238}} (In 2013 the trial heard that Gosnell had also been in dispute with his medical waste company, with the latter stopping their services.<ref>{{cite news|last=DALE|first=MARYCLAIRE|title=Kermit Gosnell, Abortion Doctor, Enters 5th Week Of Murder Trial; More Gruesome Details Revealed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/15/kermit-gosnell-abortion-doctor-trial-5th-week_n_3084012.html|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=15 April 2013}}</ref>)
:* Surgical malpractice including perforation of bodily organs and "on at least two occasions" death;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|1}}
:* Improper equipment and usage, including repeated reuse ("over and over") of disposable supplies, and "generally broken" life-saving and monitoring equipment (including [[blood pressure monitoring]], [[oximeter]]s, and [[defibrillator]]s);<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|2}}
:* Padlocked emergency access and exit routes;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|2}}
:* Lack of properly trained staff, "bogus doctors"<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|242}} — unqualified, unlicensed and unsupervised staff who misrepresented themselves to patients as qualified licensed clinicians — and no qualified nurses.<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|2, 24, 238-242}} The jury reported that "Most of Gosnell’s employees who worked with patients had little or no remotely relevant training or education".<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|32}} (Ex-employee Marcella Choung, who in 2001 and at interview in 2002 gave a detailed written complaint to the Pennsylvania Department of State, testified that her 'training' for anesthesia consisted of "a 15-minute description by Gosnell and reading a chart he had posted in a cabinet."<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|52}}) 
:* Gosnell himself was largely absent and left the clinic to be operated by his unqualified employees, whom he sometimes "ordered" to perform medical actions even if they "protested" that they were unqualified. Employees testified they had to rely on themselves, as "Gosnell disliked it when workers disturbed him by calling for medication advice";<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|2-3, 38, 51, 242}}
:* Operation of a "prescription treadmill" whereby blank signed prescriptions would be left for those seeking controlled medications, unsupervised and uncontrolled by a practitioner (which was the subject of a parallel and separate Federal investigation);<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|2}}
:* Willful non-compliance with laws intended to safeguard vulnerable women, including non-compliance with requirements for mandatory counseling, consent (for minors), waiting periods (between visiting and surgery);<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|3, 235-236}}
:* Fraudulent temporary employment of a nurse for 4 days during an NAF inspection, with the aim of deceiving the inspectors into believing that his practice staff included a licensed registered nurse (which it did not), over the few days of their on-site review - the nurse resigned upon realizing the fraud, which also involved Gosnell taking her paycheck back afterwards and paying her in cash instead;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|91-92}}
:* Fraudulent recording of gestational age and training of staff to manipulate ultrasound in a way that would match the stated number of weeks;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|3-4, 232-235}}
:* Dishonest statements by Gosnell and employees to investigators, including claims that Ms. Mongar's death was due to her own action (discredited forensically), falsification and destruction of records, and lying about the manner of her death and Gosnell's (lack of) presence for anesthesia;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|230-232}}
:* Patients given labor and delivery inducing drugs during the day, then left waiting until late evening for Gosnell to attend or for surgery.<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|4}} Many gave birth during the day as a result, and employees testified "it was standard procedure for women to deliver fetuses – and viable babies – into toilets" while waiting for his arrival.<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|4,64}}
:* Practice staff routinely delivered living babies in the third [[Pregnancy|trimester]], subsequently killing them (or ensuring their death).<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|1}} As part of this, fetuses and babies had their demise "ensured" post operatively by severing of the [[spinal cord]] with scissors, known by staff as "snipping". Most of these were deemed infeasible to prosecute because files and other evidence were not held, although the report stipulates they numbered in the "hundreds". Among the "few cases" where tangible evidence existed, the jury noted a boy aged 30 weeks at 6 pounds, a frozen body in a water container of "at least" 28 weeks,  remains of at least one abortion of over 32 weeks for which an extra $1000 had been demanded, and testimony of a baby heard to make noise, and a baby left "moving and breathing for at least 20 minutes" prior to "snipping". The jury heard testimony about "special" Sunday sessions, at which only Gosnell and his wife were present, which they suspected (and in some cases were able to corroborate) would include cases that were more advanced in time, or more disturbing;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|5-6, 26, 223-228, 234}}
:* Over time Gosnell and his practice acquired a "bad reputation" and during the decade 2000-2009 local community organizations ceased referring patients there. To compensate the practice took on referrals from other in-state cities; it became understood that Gosnell's center would perform abortions "at any stage, without regard for legal limits";<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|26-27}}
:* Where induced labor failed, Dr Gosnell would attempt to abort surgically, "often calamitous[ly]" for the woman involved. Example outcomes included:<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|5-8, 66-69}}
:::* Woman "left lying in place for hours after Gosnell tore her [[cervix]] and [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]", relatives called police after entrance refused, remedial colon surgery required
:::* Woman sent home with fetal remains unremoved, "serious infection" led to near death
:::* Punctured uterus leading to shock from blood loss and [[hysterectomy]], woman "held for hours" by the practice
:::* Patient suffered "[[convulsions]]" and fell off the operating table sustaining a head injury, Gosnell "wouldn’t call an ambulance, and wouldn’t let the woman’s companion leave the building so that he could call an ambulance"
:::* Sedation used to mute sounds of pain, Gosnell specified pre-set amounts of drugs for non-physician staff to use on patients, but without reference to individual needs, and without records or monitoring of condition. On numerous occasions the same patient was dosed multiple times in quick succession by different employees;<ref>"Cross testified that she could recall at least 15 times when she had medicated a second-trimester patient only to have Williams come along right behind her and medicate again" (Grand Jury report p.69)</ref>
:::* Death of Karnamaya Mongar, who received "repeated unmonitored, unrecorded intravenous injections of [[Demerol]]" (meperidine hydrochloride, an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] which the report describes practice staff using as a cheap but dangerous sedative), and ceased breathing. Staff were unable to revive her (emergency medications were not used and the defibrillator was not working), and paramedics were unable to revive her after gaining access, in part because they were deceived by staff as to what had happened and the drugs and dosages responsible

;Government and third party handling
:* Gosnell was "caught by accident" after a raid for illegal prescribing revealed the conditions to officers involved;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|8}}
:*  Pennsylvania Department of Health failed to regulate properly and failed to ensure that the issues noticed were addressed on the few occasions around 1990 that Gosnell was inspected, and ceased inspections "for political reasons" (to reduce a perceived deterrent) at the time [[Tom Ridge]] took office as Governor of the State;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|8-9}}
:* Inspections were still to continue if complaints were received, yet repeated complaints did not trigger an investigation: the department's response came after media exposure;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|8-9}}
:* The Department of State's [[Board of Medicine]], which licenses and oversees physicians, had "more damning information than anyone else" including a description of the practice by an ex-employee (Choung) a decade previously (2001 and again 2002), as well as knowledge of at least one of the serious incidents cited of surgical malpractice, but took verbal assurances from Gosnell and no other effective or substantial investigative action over these;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|10-11}}
:* Department of Public Health employees "regularly" visited the practice but had not adequately reported the issues present. One inspection confirmed "numerous violations of protocols for storage and disposal of infectious waste" but no follow-up occurred;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|11-12}}
:* A "health department representative" visiting for a [[vaccination program]] in 2009 "discovered that Gosnell was scamming the program" and "was able to file detailed reports identifying many of the most egregious elements of Gosnell’s practice." Her attempts to raise concerns were ignored - the Grand Jury report states "her reports went into a black hole";<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|12}}
:* Other third parties had knowledge but took no visible action. These included the pediatrian and subsequent head of the city’s health department, Dr Schwartz, who around 1996-97 reported concerns about the practice to which no action was taken, and who did not himself act after being promoted, [[University of Pennsylvania]] hospital and [[Penn Presbyterian Medical Center]] who treated numerous surgical failures from Gosnell's practice including a "flagrantly illegal abortion" but only reported one of them, the [[National Abortion Federation]] whose evaluator around 2009 noted "records were not properly kept, that risks were not explained, that patients were not monitored, that equipment was not available, that anesthesia was misused" and concluded "[i]t was the worst abortion clinic she had ever inspected" but no report was made of this to any official body;<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|12-13}}

;Culpability
:* The report divided offences by Goswell and other practice employees into three categories - "charges arising from the baby murders and illegal abortions; charges in connection with the death of Karnamaya Mongar; and charges stemming generally from the ongoing operation of a [[criminal enterprise]]". The charges recommended were:<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|13-15, 219-245}}
:::* Gosnell, Williams, Moton, and Massof - charged with first degree murder for the post operative killings where evidence existed that the baby was [[born alive rule|born alive]]
:::* Gosnell, Williams, Moton, Massof, and West - charged with [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder in relation to "hundreds of unidentifiable instances" of post-operative killings (called "snipping" by staff). The jury also recommended charges of [[solicitation to commit murder]] by Gosnell.<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|223}}
:::* Gosnell and (as co-conspirators) Williams, West, and Gosnell's wife - charged with various violations of the [[Abortion Control Act]], including infanticide and illegal late-term abortions
:::* Gosnell, Williams, and West - charged with third-degree murder (Pennysylvania's equivalent to [[voluntary manslaughter|reckless or voluntary manslaughter]]), drug delivery resulting in death, violations of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] and conspiracy in regard to the death of Karnamaya Mongar. The report states: ''"Gosnell’s contempt for the law and his patients cost Karnamaya Mongar her life. Her death was the direct result of deliberate and dangerous conduct by Gosnell and his staff."''<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|220}}
:::* Gosnell, West, and Hampton - charged with hindering apprehension, and lying to the police, medical practitioners, and the grand jury about the circumstances of Mongar's death (Hampton was also charged with [[perjury]] in the same matter)
:::* Gosnell - recommended to be charged with abuse of corpses, in regards to the "mutilat[ion of] babies and fetuses by cutting off their feet" and the "bizarre" storage of parts of fetal bodies in around 30 jars and other containers at his practice; his explanation that this was done for possible paternity cases was "rejected out of hand".<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|236-238}}
:::* The Grand Jury also concluded that "[[Illegality]] was so integral to the operation of the Women’s Medical Society that the business itself was a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|corrupt organization]]" (18 Pa.C.S. § 911, "based on a pattern of racketeering activity"):<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|14, 241-244}}
::::* Gosnell, Williams, West, Moton, Joe, Baldwin, Gosnell's wife, Massof, and O’Neill - charged with running that organization or conspiring to do so
::::* Massof and O’Neill - charged with [[theft by deception]] for pretending to be doctors, and billing for their services as if they were licensed physicians, and (with Gosnell) conspiracy to this effect
::::* Gosnell - charged with [[obstruction of justice|obstruction]] and [[tampering with evidence]], for altering his patient files to hide illegality and for destroying or removing other files entirely
::::* Gosnell and Baldwin - charged with [[corrupting the morals of a minor]], by hiring her 15-year-old daughter as a staff member, who was "required to work 50-hour weeks, starting after school until past midnight, during which she was exposed to the full horrors of Gosnell’s practice".
:::* Of Gosnell himself, the report concluded,
::::: "We believe, given the manner in which Gosnell operated, that he killed the vast majority of babies that he aborted after 24 weeks. We cannot, however, recommend murder charges for all of these cases. In order to constitute murder, the act must involve a baby who was born alive. Because files were falsified or removed from the facility and possibly destroyed, we cannot substantiate all of the individual cases in which charges might otherwise have resulted."<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|115}}
:* The report also examined the failings of official parties, and the key findings, analyzed in two categories:<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|15-16}}
:::* "Janice Staloski of the [[Pennsylvania Department of Health]], who personally participated in the 1992 site visit, but decided to let Gosnell slide on the violations that were already evident then. She eventually rose to become director of the division that was supposed to regulate abortion providers, but never looked at Gosnell despite specific complaints from lawyers, a doctor, and a medical examiner. After she was nonetheless promoted, her successor as division director, Cynthia Boyne, failed to order an investigation of the clinic even when Karnamaya Mongar died there. Senior legal counsel Kenneth Brody insisted that the department had no legal obligation to monitor abortion clinics, even though it exercised such a duty until the Ridge administration, and exercised it again as soon as Gosnell became big news. The agency’s head lawyer, chief counsel Christine Dutton, defended the department’s indifference: 'People die,' she said."
:::* "Lawyers at the [[Pennsylvania Department of State]] behaved in the same fashion. Attorneys Mark Greenwald, Charles Hartwell, David Grubb, Andrew Kramer, William Newport, Juan Ruiz, and Kerry Maloney were confronted with a growing pile of disquieting facts about Gosnell, including a detailed, inside account from a former employee (Marcella Choung, 2001<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|176-180}}), and a 22-year-old dead woman. Every time, though, they managed to dismiss the evidence as immaterial ... until the facts hit the fan."

'''Recommendations:'''<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|16-17}}
:* Department of Health should explicitly regulate and annually inspect abortion practices, and examine patient files, licenses, and equipment on-site;
:* Second-trimester abortions should be performed or supervised by doctors who are board-certified obstetrics and gynecology;
:* Department of State "must repair its review process", including easier reporting, confidentiality, post-investigation response, with cases automatically checked against past records, malpractice databases, and full past history;
:* Reports about individual doctors checked against reports of medical offices where they worked, and vice versa;
:* Department of Public Health "should do at least as much to control infectious medical waste as it does to inspect swimming pools";
:* The conclusions finished by examining the extent to which legislation had been inadequate, and the scope for legislative change, concluding that:<ref name="grandjury2011" />{{rp|17}}
::: "Statutory changes are necessary as well. Infanticide and third-trimester abortion are serious crimes. The two-year statute of limitations currently applicable for these offenses is inadequate to their severity. The limitations period for late abortion should be extended to five years; infanticide, like homicide, should have none. Impersonating a physician is also a serious, and potentially very dangerous, act. Yet under current law it is not a crime at all. An appropriate criminal provision should be enacted. There may also be other statutory and regulatory revisions that we, as lay people, have not thought to consider. Legislative hearings may be appropriate to further examine these issues."

====List of defendants, and related charges, verdicts and sentencing====
Gosnell was charged with seven counts of first-degree murder (reduced to 4 counts at trial) and one count of third-degree murder, as well as infanticide (dismissed at trial), 5 counts of abusing a corpse (all dismissed at trial), multiple counts of conspiracy, criminal solicitation and violation of a state law that forbids abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doctor Kermit Gosnell disputes 'killings' at Philadephia abortion clinic|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/news/2013/03/doctor-kermit-gosnell-disputes-killings-philadephia-abortion-clinic#ixzz2NzFVPsag|publisher=San Francisco Examiner|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="philly 23 April" />.<ref name="USA today 30 April">[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/30/abortion-doctor-philadelphia-gosnell/2123339/ http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/30/abortion-doctor-philadelphia-gosnell/2123339/] - USA Today, by Sean O’Sullivan, 30 April 2013.

== Impact and aftermath ==

===Other bodies and persons claiming to have made reports ===
In April 2011 the University of Pennsylvania Health System claimed they had provided reports to "authorities" as early as 1999 about botched procedures by Gosnell.  The only case the any reports were produced for was that of Semika Shaw, a 22-year-old, who died at the University of Pennsylvania hospital as a result of bleeding and sepsis caused by a botched procedure by Gosnell.  Gosnell's insurers settled a lawsuit with family members of Shaw for $900,000. The health system also claims other undocumented reports were made orally, for which they did not have records.<ref>[http://www.newstribune.com/news/2011/apr/10/jury-philly-docs-failed-report-dangerous-peer/ Kathy Matheson for the Associated Press, specifically from the Jefferson City ''News Tribine'', April 10, 2011, retrieved April 17, 2013]</ref>

===Regulatory and legislative impact===
The Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee of the Pennsylvania State Senate led by [[Robert M. Tomlinson]] began a hearing in February 2011 to look into the failure of the Pennsylvania Department of State, charged with licensing doctors, to provide any oversight of Gosnell's activities.  At the same time the [[Public Health and Welfare Committee]] of the state Senate chaired by [[Pat Vance]] conducted hearings on the Pennsylvania State Health Department's failure to put a stop to Gosnell's activities.<ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700108194/Pa-senators-vow-abortion-clinic-investigation.html Peter Jackson for the associated press as reported in ''Deseret News'', Feb. 8, 2011]</ref>

In part as a result of the grand jury report on Gosnell, in late 2011 Pennsylvania passed a law, SB 732, that placed abortion clinics under the same health and safety regulations as other outpatient surgical centers.  Among those who supported the bill was Democrat [[Margo L. Davidson]], whose cousin Semika Shaw died as a result of procedures done by Gosnell.<ref>[http://www.pafamily.org/index.php?pID=228 Pennsylvania Family Counsil article on SB 732 passage]</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/2013/03/28/175459510/pennsylvania-tightens-abortion-rules-following-clinic-deaths Jeff Brady, "Pennsylvania Tightens Abortion Rules Following Clinic Deaths", ''NPR'', March 28, 2013, retried April 17, 2013]</ref>  Davidson specificially linked her support of the additional regulations to the death of her cousin, which she attributed to poor medical practices.<ref>[http://articles.philly.com/2011-12-16/news/30524783_1_clinic-bill-abortion-clinics-gosnell-clinic Amy Worden, "Legislator explains her backing of abortion crackdown", ''Philadelphia Inquirerer'', December 16, 2011, retried April 17, 2013]</ref>

=== Non-legislative actions resulting from the case===
In February 2011 [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] and former [[Attorney General of Pennsylvania|State Attorney General]] [[Tom Corbett]] fired six employees and commenced action to fire eight others where for legal or contractual reasons, more extensive dismissal procedures were required. These included Basil Merenda, the acting head of the Pennsylvania Department of State, Christine Dutton, the Department of Health's chief counsel (who, in reaction to being questioned why the Department did not react to a death at Gosnell's clinic, said "people die"), and Stacy Mitchell, a deputy secretary in the health department (whom the grand jury cited as a key figure in the Health Department's indifference to, and non-regulation of, abortion clinics).  Some of the people most connected by the grand jury report with the failure of the government to act, such as Janice Staloski, had retired by this point and so no action was taken against them.<ref>[http://articles.philly.com/2011-02-16/news/28538670_1_corbett-state-agencies-clinic Amy Worden, "Corbett fires six in connection with abortion-clinic case", ''Philadelphia Inquirerer'', February 16, 2011]</ref>

==Civil cases==
The family of Karnamaya Mongar has brought a [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]] against Gosnell and sought to [[freezing of assets|freeze his assets]] to prevent him from transferring them to other people to avoid paying.<ref>[http://www.sify.com/news/philly-abortion-doc-agrees-to-freeze-most-assets-news-others-ld0wOqbhjdd.html Sify news article on the attempt to freeze assets]</ref>  As of April 2013 the suit is still pending.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/16/woman-testifies-about-mom-death-at-philadelphia-abortion-clinic/ "Woman testifies about Mom's death at Philadelphia Abortion Clinic", ''Fox News'', April 16, 2013]</ref>

Gosnell also practiced in other states, including [[Delaware]].

A spokesperson for the [[National Abortion Federation]], an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that "they’d cleaned the place up and hired an [[Registered nurse|RN]] [registered nurse] for our visit.

:* "I expect to be vindicated."
:* [Regarding the allegations] "to tell you the truth, I hope to read them in 3 to 6 months [...] because I have lived through negative publicity before."
:* "It's something I have personally experienced several times before where my surgical abilities have been challenged, where the choices that I have made have not always been perfect."
:* "If you are not making mistakes, you are not really attempting to do something, so I think that my patients are aware that I do my very best by them."
:* "The standard that I share with everyone that, I frequently say is that I provide the same care that I would provide my own daughter I feel."
:* "I have a story to tell.  [...] my work to the community is of value."
:* Gosnell reported that he received outpouring of support: "letters, I have gotten wonderful little messages of support, and confidence that I am a good person will prevail."

===Criticism of media coverage===

In an April 11, 2013 opinion column for [[USA Today]], [[Kirsten Powers]] wrote, "A [[Lexis-Nexis]] search shows none of the news shows on the three major national television networks has mentioned the Gosnell trial in the last three months", and that national press coverage was represented by a ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' columnist who "hijacked" a segment on ''[[Meet the Press]]'', a single page A-17 story on the first day of the trial by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', and no original coverage by the ''[[Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/04/10/philadelphia-abortion-clinic-horror-column/2072577/ |publisher=USAToday|title=Philadelphia abortion clinic horror: Column |first=Kirsten|last=Powers |date= Apr 11, 2013 |work=USAtday}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Melinda Henneberger responded that "we didn’t write more because the only abortion story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s not so much a conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, "One colleague viewed Gosnell’s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can’t think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn’t keep us from covering [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/04/15/why-kermit-gosnell-hasnt-been-on-page-one/|publisher=Washington Post|title=Why Kermit Gosnell hasn’t been on Page One |first=Melinda|last=Henneberger|date= Apr 15, 2013}}</ref>  Writing for Bloomberg View Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story "upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn’t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss".

<!--   EDITOR NOTE: 
        Gosnell has NOT been found legally guilty yet, so links such as "serial killers", "medical murder" etc SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE USED
        as they might imply a formal legal finding that has NOT happened.
