The stages of HIV infection are [[Acute (medical)|acute infection]] (also known as primary infection), latency and AIDS. Acute infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph node]]s), [[pharyngitis|inflammation of the throat]], [[rash]], [[myalgia|muscle pain]], [[malaise]], and mouth and esophageal sores. The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various [[opportunistic infection]]s, cancers and other conditions.

It occurs after the incubation stage, before the latency stage and the potential [[AIDS]] succeeding the latency stage. 

During this period (usually 2–4 weeks post-exposure) many individuals develop an influenza or [[mononucleosis]]-like illness called [[acute HIV infection]], the most common symptoms of which may include [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy]], [[pharyngitis]], [[rash]], [[myalgia]], [[malaise]], mouth and esophageal sores, and may also include, but less commonly, [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], enlarged liver/spleen, [[weight loss]], [[Candidiasis|thrush]], and neurological symptoms. Infected individuals may experience all, some, or none of these symptoms. The duration of symptoms varies, averaging 28 days and usually lasting at least a week.<ref name=Kahn>{{cite journal

Because of the nonspecific nature of these symptoms, they are often not recognized as signs of HIV infection. Even if patients go to their doctors or a hospital, they will often be misdiagnosed as having one of the more common [[infectious disease]]s with the same symptoms. As a consequence, these primary symptoms are not used to diagnose HIV infection, as they do not develop in all cases and because many are caused by other more common diseases. However, recognizing the syndrome can be important because the patient is much more infectious during this period.<ref name="pmid11187417">{{cite journal |author=Daar ES, Little S, Pitt J, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis of primary HIV-1 infection.

==Latency==
A strong immune defense reduces the number of viral particles in the blood stream, marking the start of secondary or chronic HIV infection.   The secondary stage of HIV infection can vary between two weeks and 20 years. During this phase of infection, HIV is active within [[Lymphatic system|lymph nodes]], which typically become persistently swollen, in response to large amounts of virus that become trapped in the follicular [[dendritic cell]]s (FDC) network.<ref name=burton>{{cite journal

Individuals who are in this phase are still infectious. During this time, [[Helper T cell|CD4<SUP>+</SUP> CD45RO<SUP>+</SUP> T cells]] carry most of the proviral load.<ref name=clapham>{{cite journal| author=Clapham PR, McKnight A. | title=HIV-1 receptors and cell tropism | journal=Br Med Bull. |year=2001 |pages=43–59 | volume=58 | issue=4 | pmid=11714623 | doi=10.1093/bmb/58.1.43}}</ref>
A small percentage of HIV-1 infected individuals retain high levels of CD4+ T-cells without antiretroviral therapy. However, most have detectable viral load and will eventually progress to AIDS without treatment. These individuals are classified as HIV controllers or [[long-term nonprogressors]] (LTNP). People who maintain CD4+ T cell counts and also have low or clinically undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment are known as elite controllers or elite suppressors (ES).<ref name=Grabar>{{cite journal |author=Grabar, S., Selinger-Leneman, H., Abgrall, S., Pialoux, G., Weiss, L., Costagliola, D. |title=Prevalence and comparative characteristics of long-term nonprogressors and HIV controller patients in the French Hospital Database on HIV |journal=AIDS | year=2009 | pages=1163–1169 |volume=23 | issue=9 |pmid=19444075 |doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32832b44c8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|20350494}}</ref>

[[File:PCPxray.jpg|thumb|X-ray of [[pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)]]. There is increased white (opacity) in the lower lungs on both sides, characteristic of PCP.]]
The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy [[immune system]]s. Most of these conditions are [[opportunistic infections]] caused by bacteria, viruses, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[parasitism|parasite]]s that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages.<ref name=Holmes>{{Cite journal|author=Holmes CB, Losina E, Walensky RP, Yazdanpanah Y, Freedberg KA|title= Review of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-related opportunistic infections in sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Clin.

People with AIDS also have an increased risk of developing various cancers such as [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[cervical cancer]] and cancers of the immune system known as [[lymphoma]]s. Additionally, people with AIDS often have systemic symptoms of infection like fevers, [[Night sweats|sweats]] (particularly at night), swollen glands, chills, weakness, and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Guss>{{Cite journal|author=Guss DA|title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome: an overview for the emergency physician, Part 1|journal=J.

===Pulmonary===
[[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|Pneumocystis pneumonia]] (PCP) (originally known as ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia) is relatively rare in healthy, [[immunocompetence|immunocompetent]] people, but common among HIV-infected individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=L|coauthors=Cattamanchi, A; Davis, JL; den Boon, S; Kovacs, J; Meshnick, S; Miller, RF; Walzer, PD; Worodria, W; Masur, H; International HIV-associated Opportunistic Pneumonias (IHOP), Study; Lung HIV, Study|title=HIV-associated Pneumocystis pneumonia.|journal=Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society|date=2011 Jun|volume=8|issue=3|pages=294–300|pmid=21653531|doi=10.1513/pats.201009-062WR|pmc=3132788}}</ref> It is caused by [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']].

Before the advent of effective diagnosis, treatment and routine [[preventive medicine|prophylaxis]] in Western countries, it was a common immediate cause of death. In developing countries, it is still one of the first indications of AIDS in untested individuals, although it does not generally occur unless the CD4 count is less than 200 cells per µL of blood.<ref name=Feldman>{{Cite journal|author=Feldman C|title=Pneumonia associated with HIV infection|journal=Curr.

[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) is unique among infections associated with HIV because it is transmissible to immunocompetent people via the respiratory route, and is not easily treatable once identified.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kwara A, Ramachandran G, Swaminathan S|title=Dose adjustment of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors during concurrent rifampicin-containing tuberculosis therapy: one size does not fit all|journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology|volume=6|issue=1|pages= 55–68|year=2010|month=January|pmid=19968575|pmc=2939445|doi=10.1517/17425250903393752}}</ref> [[Multiple drug resistance|Multidrug resistance]] is a serious problem. [[Tuberculosis]] with HIV co-infection (TB/HIV) is a major world health problem according to the [[World Health Organization]]: in 2007, 456,000 deaths among incident TB cases were HIV-positive, a third of all TB deaths and nearly a quarter of the estimated 2 million HIV deaths in that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2009/pdf/full_report.pdf|title=Global Tuberculosis Control 2009|format=PDF|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref> Even though its incidence has declined because of the use of directly observed therapy and other improved practices in Western countries, this is not the case in developing countries where HIV is most prevalent. In early-stage HIV infection (CD4 count >300 cells per µL), TB typically presents as a pulmonary disease. In advanced HIV infection, TB often presents atypically with extrapulmonary (systemic) disease a common feature. Symptoms are usually constitutional and are not localized to one particular site, often affecting [[bone marrow]], [[bone]], urinary and [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]s, [[liver]], regional [[lymph node]]s, and the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=Decker>{{Cite journal|author=Decker CF, Lazarus A|title=Tuberculosis and HIV infection.

===Gastrointestinal===
[[Esophagitis]] is an inflammation of the lining of the lower end of the [[esophagus]] (gullet or swallowing tube leading to the [[stomach]]). In HIV-infected individuals, this is normally due to fungal ([[candidiasis]]) or viral ([[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex-1]] or [[cytomegalovirus]]) infections. In rare cases, it could be due to [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]].<ref name=Zaidi>{{Cite journal|author=Zaidi SA, Cervia JS|title=Diagnosis and management of infectious esophagitis associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection|journal=Journal of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care|volume=1|issue=2|pages=53–62|year=2002 |pmid=12942677 |doi=10.1177/154510970200100204}}</ref>

Unexplained chronic [[diarrhea]] in HIV infection is due to many possible causes, including common bacterial (''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'' or ''[[Campylobacter]]'') and parasitic infections; and uncommon opportunistic infections such as [[cryptosporidiosis]], [[microsporidiosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection|Mycobacterium avium]]'' complex (MAC) and viruses,<ref name="pmid11444032">{{Cite journal|author=Pollok RC |title=Viruses causing diarrhoea in AIDS |journal=Novartis Foundation Symposium |volume=238 |pages=276–83; discussion 283–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11444032|doi=10.1002/0470846534.ch17|series=Novartis Foundation Symposia|isbn=978-0-470-84653-7}}</ref> [[astrovirus]], [[adenoviridae|adenovirus]], [[rotavirus]] and [[cytomegalovirus]], (the latter as a course of [[colitis]]).

In some cases, diarrhea may be a side effect of several drugs used to treat HIV, or it may simply accompany HIV infection, particularly during primary HIV infection. It may also be a side effect of [[antibacterial|antibiotic]]s used to treat bacterial causes of diarrhea (common for ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''). In the later stages of HIV infection, diarrhea is thought to be a reflection of changes in the way the [[human gastrointestinal tract|intestinal tract]] absorbs nutrients, and may be an important component of HIV-related [[wasting]].<ref name=Guerrant>{{Cite journal|author=Guerrant RL, Hughes JM, Lima NL, Crane J|title=Diarrhea in developed and developing countries: magnitude, special settings, and etiologies|journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S41–50 |year=1990|pmid=2406855|doi=10.1093/clinids/12.Supplement_1.S41}}</ref>

===Neurological and psychiatric===
HIV infection may lead to a variety of neuropsychiatric [[sequela]]e, either by infection of the now susceptible nervous system by organisms, or as a direct consequence of the illness itself.<ref>{{cite pmid |20571601}}</ref>

[[Toxoplasmosis]] is a disease caused by the single-celled [[parasitism|parasite]] called ''Toxoplasma gondii''; it usually infects the brain, causing toxoplasma [[encephalitis]], but it can also infect and cause disease in the [[human eye|eye]]s and lungs.<ref name=Luft>{{Cite journal|author=Luft BJ, Chua A|title=Central Nervous System Toxoplasmosis in HIV Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Therapy |journal=Current Infectious Disease Reports |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=358–362 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=11095878|doi=10.1007/s11908-000-0016-x}}</ref> Cryptococcal meningitis is an infection of the [[meninges|meninx]] (the membrane covering the brain and [[spinal cord]]) by the fungus ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]''.

[[Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) is a [[demyelinating disease]], in which the gradual destruction of the [[myelin]] sheath covering the [[axon]]s of nerve cells impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is caused by a virus called [[JC virus]] which occurs in 70% of the population in [[Virus latency|latent]] form, causing disease only when the immune system has been severely weakened, as is the case for AIDS patients. It progresses rapidly, usually causing death within months of diagnosis.<ref name=Sadler>{{Cite journal|author=Sadler M, Nelson MR |title=Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in HIV|journal=International Journal of STD & AIDS |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=351–7 |year=1997 |month=June|pmid=9179644 |doi=10.1258/0956462971920181}}</ref>

[[AIDS dementia complex]] (ADC) is a metabolic [[encephalopathy]] induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of HIV infected brain [[macrophage]]s and [[microglia]].

AIDS related mania is sometimes seen in patients with advanced HIV illness; it presents with more irritability and cognitive impairment and less euphoria than a [[mania|manic episode]]associated with true [[bipolar disorder]].

===Tumors===
[[File:Kaposi's Sarcoma.jpg|thumb|[[Kaposi's sarcoma]] ]]

People with HIV infections have substantially increased incidence of several cancers. This is primarily due to co-infection with an [[oncogene|oncogenic]] [[DNA virus]], especially [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] (KSHV) (also known as human herpesvirus-8 [HHV-8]), and human[[papillomaviridae|papillomavirus]] (HPV).<ref name="Boshoff2002">{{Cite journal| author=Boshoff C, Weiss R |title=AIDS-related malignancies | journal=Nat.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor in HIV-infected patients. The appearance of this tumor in young homosexual men in 1981 was one of the first signals of the AIDS epidemic. Caused by a [[Gammaherpesvirinae|gammaherpes]] virus called [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus]] (KSHV), it often appears as purplish [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]] on the skin, but can affect other organs, especially the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. High-grade [[B cell]] [[lymphoma]]s such as [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], Burkitt's-like lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and [[primary central nervous system lymphoma]] present more often in HIV-infected patients. These particular cancers often foreshadow a poor prognosis. [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) or KSHV cause many of these lymphomas. In HIV-infected patients, lymphoma often arises in extranodal sites such as the gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ho-Yen C and Chang F |title=Gastrointestinal Malignancies in HIV/AIDS |journal=The AIDS Reader |volume=18 |issue=6|date=June 1, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/aids/article/1145619/1359079}}</ref> When they occur in an HIV-infected patient, KS and aggressive B cell lymphomas confer a diagnosis of AIDS.

Invasive [[cervical cancer]] in HIV-infected women is also considered AIDS-defining, it is caused by [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Palefsky J |title=Human papillomavirus infection in HIV-infected persons |journal=Top HIV Med |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=130–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17720998 }}</ref>

In addition to the AIDS-defining tumors listed above, HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of certain other tumors, notably [[Hodgkin's disease]], [[Anal cancer|anal]] and [[colorectal cancer|rectal carcinoma]]s, [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]s, [[head and neck cancer]]s, and lung cancer. Some of these are causes by viruses, such as Hodgkin's disease (EBV), anal/rectal cancers (HPV), head and neck cancers (HPV), and hepatocellular carcinoma ([[hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C|C]]). Other contributing factors include exposure to carcinogens (cigarette smoke for lung cancer), or living for years with subtle immune defects.

Interestingly, the incidence of many common tumors, such as breast cancer or [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], does not increase in HIV-infected patients. In areas where [[Antiretroviral drug|HAART]] is extensively used to treat AIDS, the incidence of many AIDS-related malignancies has decreased, but at the same time malignant cancers overall have become the most common cause of death of HIV-infected patients.<ref name=Bonnet>{{Cite journal| author=Bonnet F | title=Malignancy-related causes of death in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy | journal=Cancer |year=2004 | pages=317–324 | volume=101 | issue=2 | pmid=15241829 | doi=10.1002/cncr.20354| author-separator=,|author2=Lewden C| author3=May T| display-authors=3| last4=Heripret| first4=Laurence| last5=Jougla|first5=Eric| last6=Bevilacqua| first6=Sibylle| last7=Costagliola| first7=Dominique| last8=Salmon|first8=Dominique| last9=Ch�Ne| first9=Genevi�ve }}</ref> In recent years, an increasing proportion of these deaths have been from non-AIDS-defining cancers.

=== Other infections ===
People with AIDS often develop opportunistic infections that present with [[non-specific symptom]]s, especially [[fever|low-grade fever]]s and weight loss. These include opportunistic infection with ''[[Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection|Mycobacterium avium]]-intracellulare'' and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV). CMV can cause colitis, as described above, and [[Cytomegalovirus retinitis|CMV retinitis]] can cause blindness.

[[Penicilliosis]] due to ''[[Penicillium marneffei]]'' is now the third most common opportunistic infection (after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and [[cryptococcosis]]) in HIV-positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia.<ref name=Skoulidis>{{cite journal|last=Skoulidis|first=F|coauthors=Morgan, MS; MacLeod, KM|title=Penicillium marneffei: a pathogen on our doorstep?|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=2004 Aug|volume=97|issue=8|pages=394–6|pmid=15286196|doi=10.1258/jrsm.97.8.394|pmc=1079563}}</ref>
