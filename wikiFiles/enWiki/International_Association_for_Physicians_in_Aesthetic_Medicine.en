The '''International Association for Physicians in Aesthetic Medicine (IAPAM)''' is a voluntary association founded to unite licensed physicians who practice aesthetic medicine, by assisting in their professional and personal development. 

Aesthetic Medicine is defined as: <blockquote>
"A branch of medicine focused on satisfying the aesthetic desires and goals of patients.  This speciality is primarily focused on the pathophysiology of aging skin, and adheres to scientific based procedures.  Physicians practicing Aesthetic Medicine are trained in both invasive and non-invasive treatment modalities, and typically utilize a combination of both to meet the needs of the patient." <ref>[http://www.iapam.com/aboutiapam] About IAPAM</ref>
</blockquote>

The IAPAM membership is open to licensed [[Doctors of Medicine|Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.), [[Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.), and the medical students studying for those degrees.  The goal of the IAPAM is to offer education, ethical standards, and credentialing to those professionals working towards discrete certifications in Aesthetic Medicine.
