'''Neuroscience''' is the [[science|scientific study]] of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neuroscience|work=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/neuroscience}}</ref> Traditionally, neuroscience has been seen as a branch of [[biology]]. However, it is currently an [[interdisciplinary]] [[science]] that collaborates with other fields such as [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], [[engineering]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[medicine]] and [[Allied health professions|allied disciplines]], [[philosophy]], [[physics]], and [[psychology]]. The term '''neurobiology''' is usually used interchangeably with the term neuroscience, although the former refers specifically to the [[biology]] of the nervous system, whereas the latter refers to the entire science of the nervous system.

The scope of neuroscience has broadened to include different approaches used to study the [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]], [[neural development|developmental]], [[neuroanatomy|structural]], [[neurophysiology|functional]], [[evolutionary neuroscience|evolutionary]], [[computational neuroscience|computational]], and [[neurological disorders|medical]] aspects of the nervous system. The techniques used by [[neuroscientist]]s have also expanded enormously, from [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] studies of individual [[neuron|nerve cells]] to [[brain mapping|imaging]] of sensory and motor tasks in the [[brain]]. Recent theoretical advances in neuroscience have also been aided by the study of [[neural network]]s.

Because of the increasing number of scientists who study the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists and educators. For example, the [[International Brain Research Organization]] was founded in 1960,<ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=History of IBRO|work=International Brain Research Organization|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=2343}}</ref> the [[International Society for Neurochemistry]] in 1963,<ref>[http://www.neurochemistry.org/Information/History/TheBeginning.aspx The Beginning], International Society for Neurochemistry</ref> the [[European Brain and Behaviour Society]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|title=About EBBS|work=European Brain and Behaviour Society|url=http://www.ebbs-science.org/cms/general/about-ebbs.html}}</ref> and the [[Society for Neuroscience]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=About SfN|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=about_sfn}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of neuroscience}}
[[File:Gray739.png|right|thumb|250px|Illustration from ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918) of a lateral view of the [[human brain]], featuring the [[hippocampus]] among other neuroanatomical features]]
The study of the nervous system dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]. Evidence of [[trepanation]], the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull with the purpose of curing headaches or [[Mental illness|mental disorders]] or relieving cranial pressure, being performed on patients dates back to [[Neolithic]] times and has been found in various cultures throughout the world. Manuscripts dating back to [[1700&nbsp;BC]] indicated that the [[Egyptians]] had some knowledge about symptoms of [[brain damage]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohamed W|year=2008|title=The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus: Neuroscience in Ancient Egypt|work=IBRO History of Neuroscience|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=3199}}</ref>

Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a "cranial stuffing" of sorts. In [[Egypt]], from the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onwards, the brain was regularly removed in preparation for [[Mummy|mummification]]. It was believed at the time that the [[heart]] was the seat of intelligence. According to [[Herodotus]], the first step of mummification was to "take a crooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the [[skull]] is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs."<ref>{{cite book|author=Herodotus|year=440BCE|title=The Histories: Book II (Euterpe)|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt}}</ref>

The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]]. He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g.,&nbsp;eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence. [[Plato]] also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul.<ref>{{cite book|author=Plato|year=360BCE|title=Timaeus|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.1b.txt}}</ref> [[Aristotle]], however, believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart.<ref name=Stanley2001>{{cite book |last1 = Finger |first1 = Stanley |title = Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations into Brain Function |edition=3rd |publisher = Oxford University Press, USA |location = New York |year = 2001 |isbn = 0-19-514694-8 |pages=3–17}}</ref> This view was generally accepted until the [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Galen]], a follower of Hippocrates and physician to [[Gladiator|Roman gladiators]], observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains.

[[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], [[Averroes]], [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]], and  [[Maimonides]], active in the Medieval Muslim world, described a number of medical problems related to the brain. In [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], [[Vesalius]] (1514–1564) and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) also made several contributions to neuroscience.

[[Image:GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Golgi's method|Golgi stain]] first allowed for the visualization of individual neurons.]]
Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the [[microscope]] and the development of a [[staining|staining procedure]] by [[Camillo Golgi]] during the late 1890s. The procedure used a [[silver chromate]] salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual [[neuron]]s. His technique was used by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and led to the formation of the [[neuron doctrine]], the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron.{{Citation needed| date=October 2012}} Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions, and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. While [[Luigi Galvani]]'s pioneering work in the late 1700s had set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons, it was in the late 19th century that [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], [[Johannes Peter Müller]], and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] demonstrated that the electrical excitation of neurons predictably affected the electrical states of adjacent neurons.{{Citation needed| date=October 2012}}

In parallel with this research, work with brain-damaged patients by [[Paul Broca]] suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions. At the time, Broca's findings were seen as a confirmation of [[Franz Joseph Gall]]'s theory that language was localized and that certain [[mental process|psychological functions]] were localized in specific areas of the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Greenblatt SH|year=1995|title=Phrenology in the science and culture of the 19th century|journal=Neurosurg|volume=37|issue=4|pages=790–805|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/1995/10000/Phrenology_in_the_Science_and_Culture_of_the_19th.25.aspx|pmid=8559310|doi=10.1227/00006123-199510000-00025}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bear MF, Connors BW, Paradiso MA|year=2001|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|edition=4th|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philedelphia, PA|isbn=0-7817-3944-6}}</ref> The [[Functional specialization (brain)|localization of function]] hypothesis was supported by observations of [[epilepsy|epileptic]] patients conducted by [[John Hughlings Jackson]], who correctly inferred the organization of the [[motor cortex]] by watching the progression of seizures through the body. [[Carl Wernicke]] further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production. Modern research still uses the [[Brodmann areas|Brodmann]] [[Cytoarchitectonics of the cerebral cortex|cerebral cytoarchitectonic map]] (referring to study of [[Organelle|cell structure]]) anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM|year=2000|title=[[Principles of Neural Science]]|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-8385-7701-6}}</ref>

In 1952, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid, [[action potentials]], and how they are initiated and propagated, known as the [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]].  In 1961-2, Richard FitzHugh and J. Nagumo simplified Hodgkin-Huxley, in what is called the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]].  In 1962, [[Bernard Katz]] modeled [[neurotransmission]] across the space between neurons known as [[synapses]].  In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the [[Morris-Lecar model]].  In 1984, J. L. Hindmarsh and R.M. Rose further modeled neurotransmission.

Beginning in 1966, [[Eric Kandel]] and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage.

==Modern neuroscience==
{{main|Outline of neuroscience}}

[[File:Nervous system diagram.png|thumb|200px|right|Human nervous system]]
The [[scientific method|scientific study]] of the nervous system has increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, principally due to advances in [[molecular biology]], [[electrophysiology]], and [[computational neuroscience]]. This has allowed neuroscientists to study the [[nervous system]] in all its aspects:  how it is structured, how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be changed. For example, it has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single [[neuron]]. Neurons are cells specialized for communication. They are able to contact with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called [[synapse]]s, at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another. Many neurons extrude long thin filaments of protoplasm called [[axon]]s, which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals, influencing the activity of other neurons, muscles, or glands at their termination points. A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other.

In vertebrates, the nervous system can be split into two parts, the [[central nervous system]] ([[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]), and the [[peripheral nervous system]]. In many species — including all vertebrates — the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain. The [[human brain]] alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled. The majority of the approximately 20–25,000 genes belonging to the human genome are expressed specifically in the brain. Due to the [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life.<ref>The United States Department of Health and Human Services. Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General. "Chapter 2: The Fundamentals of Mental Health and Mental Illness" pp 38[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych205-2.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012</ref> Thus the challenge of making sense of all this complexity is formidable.

===Molecular and cellular neuroscience===
{{main|Molecular neuroscience|Cellular neuroscience}}
[[Image:neuron colored.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Photograph of a [[staining|stained neuron]] in a chicken embryo]]
The study of the nervous system can be done at multiple levels, ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels. At the molecular level, the basic questions addressed in [[molecular neuroscience]] include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how [[axons]] form complex connectivity patterns. At this level, tools from [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]] are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions. The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], molecular identity, and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest.

The fundamental questions addressed in [[cellular neuroscience]] include the mechanisms of how neurons process [[cell signaling|signals]] physiologically and electrochemically. These questions include how signals are processed by neurites – thin extensions from a neuronal [[Perikaryon|cell body]], consisting of [[dendrite]]s (specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons) and [[axon]]s (specialized to conduct nerve impulses called [[action potential]]s) – and somas (the cell bodies of the neurons containing the nucleus), and how [[neurotransmitter]]s and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron. Another major area of neuroscience is directed at investigations of the [[neural development|development]] of the nervous system. These questions include the [[Regional specification|patterning and regionalization]] of the nervous system, neural [[stem cell]]s, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of neurons and glia, [[Neural development#Neuronal migration|neuronal migration]], axonal and dendritic development, [[Growth factor|trophic interactions]], and [[Synaptogenesis|synapse formation]].

===Neural circuits and systems===
{{main|Biological neural network|Systems neuroscience}}
At the systems level, the questions addressed in [[systems neuroscience]] include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as [[reflex]]es, [[sensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does [[Visual perception|vision]] work? How do [[songbirds]] learn new songs and [[bat]]s localize with [[ultrasound]]? How does the [[somatosensory system]] process tactile information? The related fields of [[neuroethology]] and [[neuropsychology]] address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific [[Ethology|animal]] and [[human behavior|human]] behaviors. [[Neuroendocrinology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] examine interactions between the nervous system and the [[endocrinology|endocrine]] and [[immunology|immune]] systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way [[neural network|networks of neurons]] produce complex [[cognition]]s and [[behavior]]s is still poorly understood.

===Cognitive and behavioral neuroscience===
{{main|Cognitive neuroscience}}
At the cognitive level, [[cognitive neuroscience]] addresses the questions of how [[mental process|psychological functions]] are produced by [[neural circuitry]]. The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as [[neuroimaging]] (e.g., [[fMRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[SPECT]]), [[electrophysiology]], and [[Human genome|human genetic analysis]] combined with sophisticated [[experimental techniques]] from [[cognitive psychology]] allows [[neuroscientist]]s and [[psychologist]]s to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates.

Neuroscience is also allied with the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]] as well as nascent interdisciplinary fields such as [[neuroeconomics]], [[decision theory]], and [[social neuroscience]] to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment.

Ultimately neuroscientists would like to understand every aspect of the nervous system, including how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be altered or repaired. The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods. Over the long term, improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress. Developments in electron microscopy, computers, electronics, functional brain imaging, and most recently genetics and genomics, have all been major drivers of progress.

===Translational research and medicine===
{{Further|Translational research}}
[[Image:Parasagittal_MRI_of_human_head_in_patient_with_benign_familial_macrocephaly_prior_to_brain_injury_(ANIMATED).gif|right|thumb|Parasagittal [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the head of a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]]]]
[[Neurology]], [[psychiatry]], [[neurosurgery]], [[psychosurgery]], [[anesthesiology]], [[neuropathology]], [[neuroradiology]], [[clinical neurophysiology]] and [[addiction medicine]] are medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and [[stroke]], and their medical treatment. Psychiatry focuses on [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], [[behavior]]al, [[cognition|cognitive]], and [[perception|perceptual]] disorders. Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by [[Research|basic research]] in neuroscience. [[Brain imaging]] also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lepage M|year=2010|title=Research at the Brain Imaging Centre|work=Douglas Mental Health University Institute|url=http://www.douglas.qc.ca/page/imagerie-cerebrale?locale=en}}</ref>

[[Integrative neuroscience]] makes connections across these specialized areas of focus.

==Neuroscience organizations==
The largest professional neuroscience organization is the [[Society for Neuroscience]] (SFN), which is based in the [[United States]] but includes many members from other countries.  Since its founding in 1969 the SFN has grown steadily:  as of 2010 it recorded 40,290 members from 83 different countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Financial and organizational highlights |publisher=Society for Neuroscience |url=http://www.sfn.org/skins/main/pdf/annual_report/fy2010/highlights.pdf}}</ref>  Annual meetings, held each year in a different American city, draw attendance from researchers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates, as well as educational institutions, funding agencies, publishers, and hundreds of businesses that supply products used in research.  

Other major organizations devoted to neuroscience include the [[International Brain Research Organization]] (IBRO), which holds its meetings in a country from a different part of the world each year, and the [[Federation of European Neuroscience Societies]] (FENS), which holds a meeting in a different European city every two years.  FENS comprises a set of 32 national-level organizations, including the [[British Neuroscience Association]], the ''German Neuroscience Society'' (''Neurowissenschaftliche Gesellschaft''), and the French ''Société des Neurosciences''.

In 2013, the [[BRAIN Initiative]] was announced in the US.

===Public education and outreach===
In addition to conducting traditional research in laboratory settings, neuroscientists have also been involved in the [[public awareness of science|promotion of awareness and knowledge]] about the nervous system among the general public and government officials. Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations. For example, individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee (IBB), which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the International Brain Bee|work=The International Brain Bee|url=http://www.internationalbrainbee.com/about_bee.html}}</ref> In the United States, large organizations such as the Society for Neuroscience have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Facts: A Primer on the Brain and Nervous System|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=brainfacts}}</ref> collaborating with public school teachers to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K-12 teachers and students,<ref>{{cite web|title=Neuroscience Core Concepts: The Essential Principles of Neuroscience|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=core_concepts}}</ref> and cosponsoring a campaign with the [[Dana Foundation]] called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Awareness Week Campaign|work=The Dana Foundation|url=http://www.dana.org/brainweek/}}</ref>

Finally, neuroscientists have also collaborated with other education experts to study and refine educational techniques to optimize learning among students, an emerging field called [[educational neuroscience]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Goswami U|year=2004|title=Neuroscience, education and special education|journal=Br J of Spec Educ|volume=31|issue=4|pages=175&ndash;183|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00352.x}}</ref> Federal agencies in the United States, such as the [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncrrsepa.org/|title=The SEPA Program|publisher=[[National Institute of Health|NIH]]|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref> and [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/ehr/about.jsp|title=About Education and Human Resources|publisher=[[National Science Foundation|NSF]]|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref> have also funded research that pertains to best practices in teaching and learning of neuroscience concepts.
