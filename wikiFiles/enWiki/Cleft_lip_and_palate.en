'''Cleft lip''' (''cheiloschisis'') and '''cleft palate''' (''palatoschisis''), which can also occur together as '''cleft lip and palate''', are variations of a type of clefting [[congenital deformity]] caused by abnormal facial development during [[gestation]]. A '''[[cleft]]''' is a fissure or opening—a gap.  It is the non-fusion of the body's natural structures that form before birth. Approximately 1 in 700 children born have a cleft lip or a cleft palate or both.  In decades past, the condition was sometimes referred to as '''harelip''', based on the similarity to the cleft in the lip of a [[hare]], but that term is now generally considered to be offensive. 

Clefts can also affect other parts of the face, such as the eyes, ears, nose, cheeks, and forehead. In 1976, [[Paul Tessier]] described fifteen lines of cleft.  Most of these craniofacial clefts are even rarer and are frequently described as Tessier clefts using the numerical locator devised by Tessier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tessier P |title=Anatomical classification facial, cranio-facial and latero-facial clefts |journal=J Maxillofac Surg |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=69–92 |year=1976 |month=June |pmid=820824 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0503(76)80013-6}}</ref>

A cleft lip or palate can be successfully treated with [[surgery]], especially so if conducted soon after [[birth]] or in early childhood.

==Signs and symptoms==
=== Cleft lip and palate ===

If the cleft does not affect the palate structure of the mouth it is referred to as cleft lip.  Cleft lip is formed in the top of the lip as either a small gap or an indentation in the lip (partial or incomplete cleft) or it continues into the nose (complete cleft). Lip cleft can occur as  a one sided (unilateral) or two sided (bilateral). It is due to the failure of fusion of the maxillary and medial [[nasal processes]] (formation of the primary palate).

=== Cleft palate ===
'''Cleft palate''' is a condition in which the two plates of the [[human skull|skull]] that form the [[hard palate]] (roof of the mouth) are not completely joined. The [[soft palate]] is in these cases cleft as well. In most cases, cleft lip is also present. Cleft palate occurs in about one in 700 live births worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/cleft_palate/stats-country.htm |title=Statistics by country for cleft palate |accessdate=2007-04-24 |work=WrongDiagnosis.com }}</ref>

Palate cleft can occur as complete (soft and hard palate, possibly including a gap in the jaw) or incomplete (a 'hole' in the roof of the mouth, usually as a cleft soft palate). When cleft palate occurs, the [[Palatine uvula|uvula]] is usually split. It occurs due to the failure of fusion of the lateral palatine processes, the nasal septum, and/or the median palatine processes (formation of the [[secondary palate]]).

The hole in the roof of the mouth caused by a cleft connects the mouth directly to the [[nasal cavity]].

Note: the next images show the roof of the mouth. The top shows the nose, the lips are colored pink. For clarity the images depict a toothless infant.

A result of an open connection between the [[oral cavity]] and [[nasal cavity]] is called [[velopharyngeal insufficiency|velopharyngeal inadequacy]] (VPI). Because of the gap, air leaks into the nasal cavity resulting in a hypernasal [[voice]] [[resonance]] and nasal emissions while talking.<ref name="Sloan">{{cite journal |author=Sloan GM |title=Posterior pharyngeal flap and sphincter pharyngoplasty: the state of the art |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac. J. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=112–22 |year=2000 |pmid=10749049 |doi=10.1597/1545-1569(2000)037<0112:PPFASP>2.3.CO;2}}</ref> Secondary effects of VPI include speech [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] errors (e.g., [[distortions]], substitutions, and omissions) and compensatory misarticulations and mispronunciations (e.g., [[glottal stop]]s and posterior nasal [[fricative]]s).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hill JS |title=Velopharyngeal insufficiency: An update on diagnostic and surgical techniques |journal=Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=365–8 |year=2001 |url=http://journals.lww.com/co-otolaryngology/Abstract/2001/12000/Velopharyngeal_insufficiency__an_update_on.5.aspx |doi=10.1097/00020840-200112000-00005}}</ref> Possible treatment options include [[speech therapy]], prosthetics, augmentation of the posterior pharyngeal wall, lengthening of the palate, and [[Pharyngeal flap surgery|surgical procedures]].<ref name="Sloan" />

Submucous cleft palate (SMCP) can also occur, which is a cleft of the soft palate with a classic clinical triad of a bifid, or split, uvula which is found dangling in the back of the throat, a furrow along the midline of the soft palate, and a notch in the back margin of the hard palate.<ref name="Kaplan">{{cite journal |author=Kaplan EN |title=The Occult and Submucous Cleft Palate |journal=Cleft Palate Journal | volume=12 |pages=356–68 |year=1975 |pmid=1058746}}</ref>

===Psychosocial===
Most children who have their clefts repaired early enough are able to have a happy youth and social life. Having a cleft palate/lip does not inevitably lead to a psychosocial problem. However, adolescents with cleft palate/lip are at an elevated risk for developing psychosocial problems especially those relating to self-concept, peer relationships and appearance. Adolescents may face psychosocial challenges but can find professional help if problems arise. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual’s [[self-esteem]], [[social skills]] and [[behavior]]. There is research dedicated to the [[social development|psychosocial development]] of individuals with cleft palate. Self-concept may be adversely affected by the presence of a cleft lip and or cleft palate, particularly among girls.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leonard BJ, Brust JD |title=Self-concept of children and adolescents with cleft lip and/or palate |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac. J. |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=347–353 |year=1991 |pmid=1742302 |doi=10.1597/1545-1569(1991)028<0347:SCOCAA>2.3.CO;2}}</ref> 

Research has shown that during the early preschool years (ages 3–5), children with cleft lip and or cleft palate tend to have a self-concept that is similar to their peers without a cleft. However, as they grow older and their social interactions increase, children with clefts tend to report more dissatisfaction with peer relationships and higher levels of [[social anxiety]]. Experts conclude that this is probably due to the associated stigma of visible deformities and possible [[speech impediment]]s. Children who are judged as attractive tend to be perceived as more intelligent, exhibit more positive social behaviors, and are treated more positively than children with cleft lip and or cleft palate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tobiasen JM |title=Psychosocial correlates of congenital facial clefts: a conceptualization and model |journal=Cleft Palate J |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=131–9 |year=1984 |month=July |pmid=6592056 }}</ref> Children with clefts tend to report feelings of anger, sadness, fear, and alienation from their peers, but these children were similar to their peers in regard to "how well they liked themselves." 

The relationship between parental attitudes and a child’s self-concept is crucial during the preschool years. It has been reported that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pope AW, Ward J |title=Self-perceived facial appearance and psychosocial adjustment in preadolescents with craniofacial anomalies |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac. J. |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=396–401 |year=1997 |pmid=9345606 |doi=10.1597/1545-1569(1997)034<0396:SPFAAP>2.3.CO;2}}</ref> Strong parent support networks may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate.<ref>{{harvnb|Bristow|Bristow|2007|pp=82–92}}</ref> In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development of social skills is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip and or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. Experts suggest that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip and or cleft palate. A child who is entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cleftline.org |title=Cleft Palate Foundation |accessdate=2007-07-01 }}</ref>

As children reach adolescence, the period of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as peer groups are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip and or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Snyder HT, Bilboul MJ, Pope AW |title=Psychosocial adjustment in adolescents with craniofacial anomalies: a comparison of parent and self-reports |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac.

Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and [[internalizing]] problems and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors.<ref name="PopeSynder" /> Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip and or cleft palate often deal with threats to their [[quality of life]] for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.

===Complications===
[[File:Cleft Nurser Mead Johnson.jpg|thumb|A baby being fed using a customized bottle. The upright sitting position allows [[Earth's gravity|gravity]] to help the baby swallow the milk more easily]]
Cleft may cause problems with feeding, ear disease, speech and socialization.

Due to lack of suction, an infant with a cleft may have trouble feeding. An infant with a cleft palate will have greater success feeding in a more upright position. Gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby's nose if he/she has cleft palate. Gravity feeding can be accomplished by using specialized equipment, such as the [[Haberman Feeder]], or by using a combination of nipples and bottle inserts like the one shown, is commonly used with other infants. A large hole, crosscut, or slit in the nipple, a protruding nipple and rhythmically squeezing the bottle insert can result in controllable flow to the infant without the stigma caused by specialized equipment. 

Individuals with cleft also face many middle ear infections which may eventually lead to hearing loss. The [[Eustachian]] tubes and external ear canals may be angled or tortuous, leading to food or other contamination of a part of the body that is normally self-cleaning. Hearing is related to learning to speak.  Babies with palatal clefts may have compromised hearing and therefore, if the baby cannot hear, it cannot try to mimic the sounds of speech. Thus, even before expressive language acquisition, the baby with the cleft palate is at risk for receptive language acquisition. Because the lips and palate are both used in pronunciation, individuals with cleft usually need the aid of a speech therapist.

==Cause==
The development of the face is coordinated by complex morphogenetic events and rapid proliferative expansion, and is thus highly susceptible to environmental and genetic factors, rationalising the high incidence of facial malformations. During the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy, the shape of the embryo's head is formed.  Five primitive tissue lobes grow:
:'''a)''' one from the top of the head down towards the future upper lip; (Frontonasal Prominence)
:'''b-c)''' two from the cheeks, which meet the first lobe to form the upper lip; (Maxillar Prominence)
:'''d-e)''' and just below, two additional lobes grow from each side, which form the chin and lower lip; (Mandibular Prominence)
If these tissues fail to meet, a gap appears where the tissues should have joined (fused). This may happen in any single joining site, or simultaneously in several or all of them. The resulting birth defect reflects the locations and severity of individual fusion failures (e.g., from a small lip or palate fissure up to a completely malformed face).

The upper lip is formed earlier than the palate, from the first three lobes named a to c above. Formation of the palate is the last step in joining the five embryonic facial lobes, and involves the back portions of the lobes b and c. These back portions are called palatal shelves, which grow towards each other until they fuse in the middle.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dudas M, Li WY, Kim J, Yang A, Kaartinen V |title=Palatal fusion — where do the midline cells go?

===Genetics===
Genetic factors contributing to cleft lip and cleft palate formation have been identified for some [[syndrome|syndromic]] cases, but knowledge about genetic factors that contribute to the more common isolated cases of cleft lip/palate is still patchy.

Many clefts run in families, even though in some cases there does not seem to be an identifiable syndrome present,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beaty TH, Ruczinski I, Murray JC, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for gene-environment interaction in a genome wide study of isolated, non-syndromic cleft palate |journal=Genet Epidemiol |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21618603 |doi=10.1002/gepi.20595 |pages=469–78 |volume=35 |issue=6 |pmc=3180858 }}</ref> possibly because of the current incomplete genetic understanding of midfacial development.

A number of genes are involved including [[cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1]] and [[GAD1]],<ref name="Kanno2004">{{cite journal |author=Kanno K, Suzuki Y, Yamada A, Aoki Y, Kure S, Matsubara Y |title=Association between nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate and the glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 gene in the Japanese population |journal=Am.

===Environment===
'''Environmental influences''' may also cause, or interact with genetics to produce, orofacial clefting. An example for how environmental factors might be linked to genetics comes from research on mutations in the gene ''[[PHF8]]'' that cause cleft lip/palate (see above). It was found that ''[[PHF8]]'' encodes for a [[histone]] lysine demethylase,<ref name= "PMID19843542">{{cite journal|last= Loenarz|first= C.|coauthors= Ge W., Coleman M. L., Rose N. R., Cooper C. D.

Current research continues to investigate the extent to which [[Folic acid]] can reduce the incidence of clefting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boyles AL, Wilcox AJ, Taylor JA, ''et al.'' |title=Folate and One-Carbon Metabolism Gene Polymorphisms and Their Associations With Oral Facial Clefts |journal=Am.

==Diagnosis==
Traditionally, the diagnosis is made at the time of birth by physical examination. Recent advances in [[prenatal diagnosis]] have allowed [[obstetrician]]s to diagnose facial clefts [[in utero]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Costello BJ, Edwards SP, Clemens M |title=Fetal diagnosis and treatment of craniomaxillofacial anomalies |journal=J. Oral Maxillofac. Surg. |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=1985–95 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18848093 |doi=10.1016/j.joms.2008.01.042 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278-2391(08)00118-3}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Cleft lip and palate is very treatable; however, the kind of treatment depends on the type and severity of the cleft.

Most children with a form of clefting are monitored by a ''cleft palate team'' or ''craniofacial team'' through young adulthood.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bristow |first1=L |last2=Bristow |first2=S |title=Making faces: Logan's cleft lip and palate story |publisher=Pulsus Group |location=Oakville, Ontaria, CA |year=2007 |pages=1–92 |ref=harv}}</ref> Care can be lifelong. Treatment procedures can vary between craniofacial teams. For example, some teams wait on jaw correction until the child is aged 10 to 12 (argument: growth is less influential as [[deciduous teeth]] are replaced by [[permanent teeth]], thus saving the child from repeated corrective surgeries), while other teams correct the jaw earlier (argument: less speech therapy is needed than at a later age when speech therapy becomes harder). Within teams, treatment can differ between individual cases depending on the type and severity of the cleft.

===Cleft lip===
Within the first 2–3 months after birth, [[surgery]] is performed to close the cleft lip. While surgery to repair a cleft lip can be performed soon after birth, often the preferred age is at approximately 10 weeks of age, following the "rule of 10s" coined by surgeons Wilhelmmesen and Musgrave in 1969 (the child is at least 10 weeks of age; weighs at least 10 pounds, and has at least 10g hemoglobin).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lydiatt DD, Yonkers AJ, Schall DG |title=The management of the cleft lip and palate patient |journal=Nebr Med J |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=325–8; discussion 328–9 |year=1989 |month=November |pmid=2586685 }}</ref> If the cleft is bilateral and extensive, two surgeries may be required to close the cleft, one side first, and the second side a few weeks later. The most common procedure to repair a cleft lip is the ''Millard procedure'' pioneered by [[Ralph Millard]]. Millard performed the first procedure at a [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]] (MASH) unit in Korea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://calder.med.miami.edu/Ralph_Millard/biography.html |title=Biography and Personal Archive |accessdate=2007-07-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070617215647/http://calder.med.miami.edu/Ralph_Millard/biography.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-17}} at miami.edu</ref>

Often an incomplete cleft lip requires the same surgery as complete cleft. This is done for two reasons. Firstly the group of [[muscle]]s required to purse the lips run through the upper lip. In order to restore the complete group a full incision must be made. Secondly, to create a less obvious scar the surgeon tries to line up the scar with the natural lines in the upper lip (such as the edges of the [[philtrum]]) and tuck away stitches as far up the nose as possible. Incomplete cleft gives the surgeon more tissue to work with, creating a more supple and natural-looking upper lip.

====Pre-surgical devices====

In some cases of a severe bi-lateral complete cleft, the premaxillary segment will be protruded far outside the mouth.
 
[[Nasoalveolar molding]] prior to surgery can improve long-term nasal symmetry among patients with complete unilateral [[cleft lip]]-[[cleft palate]] patients compared to correction by surgery alone, according to a retrospective [[cohort study]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barillas I, Dec W, Warren SM, Cutting CB, Grayson BH |title=Nasoalveolar molding improves long-term nasal symmetry in complete unilateral cleft lip-cleft palate patients |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=123 |issue=3 |pages=1002–6 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19319066 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e318199f46e |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&volume=123&issue=3&spage=1002}}</ref> In this study, significant  improvements in nasal symmetry were observed in multiple areas including measurements of the projected length of the nasal ala (lateral surface of the external nose), position of the superoinferior alar groove, position of the mediolateral nasal dome,
and nasal bridge deviation. "The nasal ala projection length demonstrated an average ratio of 93.0 percent in the surgery-alone group and 96.5 percent in the nasoalveolar molding group" this study concluded.

===Cleft palate===

[[File:Repairedcleftpalate.JPG|thumb|A repaired cleft palate on a 64-year-old female.]]
Often a cleft palate is temporarily covered by a [[palatal obturator]] (a prosthetic device made to fit the roof of the mouth covering the gap). 

Cleft palate can also be corrected by [[surgery]], usually performed between 6 and 12 months. Approximately 20–25% only require one palatal surgery to achieve a competent velopharyngeal valve capable of producing normal, non-[[hypernasal speech]]. However, combinations of surgical methods and repeated surgeries are often necessary as the child grows. One of the new innovations of cleft lip and cleft palate repair is the [[Latham appliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fukuyama E, Omura S, Fujita K, Soma K, Torikai K |title=Excessive rapid palatal expansion with Latham appliance for distal repositioning of protruded premaxilla in bilateral cleft lip and alveolus |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac. J. |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=673–7 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17105324 |doi=10.1597/05-109 |url=http://www.cpcjournal.org/doi/full/10.1597/05-109}}</ref> The Latham is surgically inserted by use of pins during the child's 4th or 5th month. After it is in place, the doctor, or parents, turn a screw daily to bring the cleft together to assist with future lip and/or palate repair.

If the cleft extends into the maxillary alveolar ridge, the gap is usually corrected by filling the gap with bone tissue. The bone tissue can be acquired from the patients own chin, rib or hip.

===Speech and hearing===
A [[tympanostomy tube]] is often inserted into the [[eardrum]] to aerate the [[middle ear]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen MS, Mandel EM, Furman JM, Sparto PJ, Casselbrant ML |title=Tympanostomy Tube Placement and Vestibular Function in Children |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |year=2011 |month=June |pmid=21676943 |doi=10.1177/0194599811412038 |url=http://oto.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21676943 |volume=145 |issue=4 |pages=666–72}}</ref> This is often beneficial for the hearing ability of the child.

Children with cleft palate typically have a variety of speech problems.  Some speech problems result directly from anatomical differences such as [[velopharyngeal inadequacy]].  Velopharyngeal inadequacy refers to the inability of the soft palate to close the opening from the throat to the nasal cavity, which is necessary for many speech sounds, such as /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, etc.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wyatt R, Sell D, Russell J, Harding A, Harland K, Albery E |title=Cleft palate speech dissected: a review of current knowledge and analysis |journal=Br J Plast Surg |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=143–9 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8785593 |doi=10.1016/S0007-1226(96)90216-7 }}</ref> This type of errors typically resolve after palate repair.<ref name="Lawrence, C. W. 1975">{{cite journal |author=Lawrence CW, Philips BJ |title=A telefluoroscopic study of lingual contacts made by persons with palatal defects |journal=Cleft Palate J |volume=12 |issue= |pages=85–94 |year=1975 |month=January |pmid=1053965 }}</ref>

However, sometimes children with cleft palate also have speech errors which develop as the result of an attempt to compensate for the inability to produce the target phoneme. These are known as compensatory articulations. Compensatory articulations are usually sounds that are non-existent in normal English phonology, often do not resolve automatically after palatal repair, and make a child’s speech even more difficult to understand.<ref name="Lawrence, C. W. 1975"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chapman KL |title=Phonologic processes in children with cleft palate |journal=Cleft Palate Craniofac. J. |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=64–72 |year=1993 |month=January |pmid=8418874 |doi=10.1597/1545-1569(1993)030<0064:PPICWC>2.3.CO;2 |url=http://www.cpcjournal.org/doi/full/10.1597/1545-1569(1993)030<0064:PPICWC>2.3.CO;2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Trost JE |title=Articulatory additions to the classical description of the speech of persons with cleft palate |journal=Cleft Palate J |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=193–203 |year=1981 |month=July |pmid=6941865 }}</ref>

Speech-language pathology can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft palate. In addition, research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bzoch, K.R. |chapter=Rationale, Methods, and Techniques of Cleft Palate Speech Therapy |editor=Bzoch, K.R |title=Communicative Disorders Related to Cleft Lip and Palate |publisher=College-Hill Press |location=Boston MA |year=1989 |pages=273–289 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

=== Hearing loss ===

Hearing impairment is particularly prevalent in children with cleft palate. The tensor muscle fibres that open the [[eustachian tube]]s lack an anchor to function effectively. In this situation, when the air in the middle ear is absorbed by the mucous membrane, the negative pressure is not compensated, which results in the secretion of fluid into the middle ear space from the mucous membrane.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Broen|first=PA|coauthors=Moller, KT, Carlstrom, J, Doyle, SS, Devers, M, Keenan, KM|title=Comparison of the hearing histories of children with and without cleft palate|journal=The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association|date=1996 Mar|volume=33|issue=2|pages=127–33|pmid=8695620|doi=10.1597/1545-1569(1996)033<0127:COTHHO>2.3.CO;2}}</ref> Children with this problem typically have a conductive hearing loss primarily caused by this middle ear effusion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Szabo C, Langevin K, Schoem S, Mabry K |title=Treatment of persistent middle ear effusion in cleft palate patients |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=874–7 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20537733 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2010.04.016 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165-5876(10)00207-7}}</ref>

===Sample treatment schedule===
Note that each individual patient's schedule is treated on a case-by-case basis and can vary per hospital. The table below shows a common sample treatment schedule. The colored squares indicate the average timeframe in which the indicated procedure occurs. In some cases this is usually one procedure (for example lip repair) in other cases this is an ongoing therapy (for example speech therapy).

=== Craniofacial team ===
{{Main|Craniofacial team}}
A craniofacial team is routinely used to treat this condition.  The majority of hospitals still use craniofacial teams; yet others are making a shift towards dedicated cleft lip and palate programs.  While craniofacial teams are widely knowledgeable about all aspects of craniofacial conditions, dedicated cleft lip and palate teams are able to dedicate many of their efforts to being on the cutting edge of new advances in cleft lip and palate care.  

Many of the top pediatric hospitals are developing their own CLP clinics in order to provide  patients with comprehensive multi-disciplinary care from birth through adolescence. Allowing an entire team to care for a child throughout their cleft lip and palate treatment (which is ongoing) allows for the best outcomes in every aspect of a child's care. While the individual approach can yield significant results, current trends indicate that team based care leads to better outcomes for CLP patients. .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-359.html|author=Joanne Green |title=The Importance of a Multi-Disciplinary Approach |accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071026035222/http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-359.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-26}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|Clefting prevalence in different cultures}}
[[Prevalence]] rates reported for live births for Cleft lip with or without Cleft Palate (CL ± P) and Cleft Palate alone (CPO) varies within different [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] groups.

The highest prevalence [[rates]] for (CL ± P) are reported for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[Asians]]. [[Africans]] have the lowest prevalence rates.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw-popup/who-is-affected-by-cleft-lip-and-cleft-palate |title=Who is affected by cleft lip and cleft palate |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>
* Native Americans: 3.74/1000
*[[Japanese people|Japanese]]: 0.82/1000 to 3.36/1000
*[[Han Chinese|Chinese]]: 1.45/1000 to 4.04/1000
*[[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]: 1.43/1000 to 1.86/1000
*[[Latin Americans]]: 1.04/1000
*Africans: 0.18/1000 to 1.67/1000

Rate of occurrence of CPO is similar for Caucasians, Africans, North American natives, Japanese and Chinese. The trait is dominant.

Prevalence of "cleft [[uvula]]" has varied from .02% to 18.8% with the highest numbers found among [[Chippewa]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and the lowest generally in Africans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cervenka J, Shapiro BL |title=Cleft uvula in Chippewa Indians: prevalence and genetics |journal=Hum.

==Society and culture==
===Controversy===
In some countries, cleft lip or palate deformities are considered reasons (either generally tolerated or officially sanctioned) to perform [[abortion]] beyond the legal [[fetal]] age limit, even though the [[fetus]] is not in jeopardy of life or limb. Some [[human rights]] activists contend this practice of "cosmetic murder" amounts to [[eugenics]]. 

The Japanese [[anime]] ''[[Ghost Stories (anime)|Ghost Stories]]'' caused controversy through an episode featuring a [[Kuchisake-onna]] (a ghost with a [[Glasgow smile]]) because her scar resembled a cleft lip.<ref>http://homepage1.nifty.com/home_aki/kaidan3.htm</ref>

===Notable cases===

==In other animals==
Cleft lips and palates are occasionally seen in [[cattle]] and [[dog]]s, and rarely in [[sheep]], [[cat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[panda]]s and [[ferret]]s. Most commonly, the defect involves the lip, [[rhinarium]], and [[premaxilla]]. Clefts of the hard and soft palate are sometimes seen with a cleft lip. The cause is usually hereditary.  [[Cephalic index|Brachycephalic]] dogs such as [[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] and [[Boston Terrier]]s are most commonly affected.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  An inherited disorder with incomplete [[penetrance]] has also been suggested in [[Shih tzu]]s, [[Swiss Sheepdog]]s, [[Bulldog]]s, and [[Pointer (dog breed)|Pointers]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Garcia | first = J.F.

It is also inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in [[Texel (sheep)|Texel sheep]].  Other contributing factors may include maternal nutritional deficiencies, exposure ''in utero'' to viral infections, trauma, drugs, or chemicals, or ingestion of toxins by the mother, such as certain [[lupin]]es by cattle during the second or third month of [[gestation]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Mouth | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/20202.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-28 }}</ref>  The use of [[corticosteroid]]s during pregnancy in dogs and the ingestion of ''[[Veratrum californicum]]'' by pregnant sheep have also been associated with cleft formation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Beasley, V.|year=1999|title=Teratogenic Agents|work=Veterinary Toxicology|url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Beasley/cpt8a/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1&table=1|accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref>

Difficulty with nursing is the most common problem associated with clefts, but [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]], and [[malnutrition]] are often seen with cleft palate and is a common cause of death.  Providing nutrition through a [[feeding tube]] is often necessary, but corrective surgery in dogs can be done by the age of twelve weeks.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  For cleft palate, there is a high rate of surgical failure resulting in repeated surgeries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee J, Kim Y, Kim M, Lee J, Choi J, Yeom D, Park J, Hong S |title=Application of a temporary palatal prosthesis in a puppy suffering from cleft palate |journal=J.
