'''Sickle cell trait''' (or '''sicklemia''') describes a condition in which a person has one abnormal allele of the hemoglobin beta gene (is [[heterozygous]]), but does not display the severe symptoms of [[sickle cell disease]] that occur in a person who has two copies of that allele (is [[homozygous]]). Those who are heterozygous for the sickle cell allele produce both normal and abnormal hemoglobin (the two alleles are co-dominant). Sickle cell disease is a blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal type of the oxygen-carrying substance [[hemoglobin]] in the [[red blood cells]]. Sickling and sickle cell disease also confer some resistance to [[malaria]] parasitization of red blood cells, so that individuals with sickle-cell trait (heterozygotes) have a selective advantage in some environments.

==Hemoglobin genetics==
Normal hemoglobin is called hemoglobin A, but people with [[sickle cell disease]] have only hemoglobin S, which turns normal, round red blood cells into abnormally curved (sickle) shapes.

Normally, a person inherits two copies of the [[gene]] that produces [[beta-globin]], a [[protein]] needed to produce normal hemoglobin ([[hemoglobin A]], genotype AA). A person with sickle cell trait inherits one normal gene and one abnormal gene encoding hemoglobin S (hemoglobin genotype AS).

==Prevalence==
Sickle cell trait prevalence is highest in [[West Africa]] (25% of the [[population]]). It also has a high prevalence in South and Central Americans, especially those in Panama. However, it also very infrequently appears in [[Mediterranean]] countries such as [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[Spain]], where it most likely expanded via the [[selective pressure]] of [[malaria]], a disease that was endemic to the region.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ragusa |first=A. |last2=et al. |year=1992 |title=Presence of an African β-globin Gene Cluster Haplotype in Normal Chromosomes in Sicily |journal=[[American Journal of Hematology|Am J Hematol]] |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=313–315 |pmid=1503087 |doi=10.1002/ajh.2830400413 }}</ref> It has been described in [[India]]ns, [[Middle Eastern]]ers (such as [[Arab]]s and [[Iran]]ians), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples, [[North Africa]]ns, and [[Turkish people|Turks]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

== Association with malaria ==

Sickle cell trait provides a survival advantage over people with normal hemoglobin in regions where malaria is endemic. The trait is known to cause significantly fewer deaths due to [[malaria]], especially when ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' is the causative organism. This is a prime example of [[natural selection]], evident by the fact that  the geographical distribution of the gene (for hemoglobin S) and the distribution of malaria in Africa virtually overlap. Because of the unique survival advantage, people with the trait increase in number as more people infected with malaria and having the normal hemoglobin tend to succumb to the complications. 

Although the precise mechanism for this phenomenon is not known, a several factors are believed to be responsible.
* Infected erythrocytes (Red Blood cells) tend to have lower oxygen tension, because it is significantly reduced by the parasite. This causes sickling of that particular erythrocyte, signalling the phagocytes to get rid of the cell and hence the parasite within. 
* Since the sickling of parasite infected cells is higher, these selectively get removed by the reticulo-endothelial system, thus sparing the normal erythrocytes.
* Excessive vacuole formation occurs in those parasites infecting sickle cells.
* Sickle trait erythrocytes produce higher levels of the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide than do normal erythrocytes, both are toxic to malarial parasites.<ref name="Malaria and the Sickle hemoglobin gene">{{cite web |url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|title=Malaria and the Sickle hemoglobin gene|publisher=Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH)}}</ref>

The sickle cell trait was found to be 50% protective against mild clinical malaria, 75% protective against admission to the hospital for malaria, and almost 90% protective against severe or complicated malaria.<ref name="Sickle cell trait and the risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and other childhood diseases."> {{Cite web|title=Sickle cell trait and the risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and other childhood diseases|author=Williams TN, Mwangi TW, Wambua S, Alexander ND, Kortok M, Snow RW, Marsh K, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Programme, Centre for Geographic Medicine Research, Coast, Kilifi District Hospital, Kilifi, Kenya|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15942909|publisher=The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)}}</ref>
