The '''Vulval vestibule''' (or "Vulvar vestibule") is a part of the [[vulva]] between the [[labia minora]] into which the [[external urethral orifice (female)|urethral opening]] and the [[vagina|vaginal opening]] open. Its edge is marked by [[Hart's Line]].

The external urethral orifice (orificium urethræ externum; [[urinary meatus]]) is placed about 2.5&nbsp;cm behind the [[glans clitoridis]] and immediately in front of that of the [[vagina]]; it usually assumes the form of a short, sagittal cleft with slightly raised margins. Nearby are the openings of the [[Skene's ducts]].

The vaginal orifice is a median slit below and behind the opening of the urethra; its size varies inversely with that of the [[hymen]].

==Pathology==
The prevalence of pain at the vulvar vestibule is relatively common. A study by the University of Michigan found that about 28% of women have experienced vulvar vestibular pain in the past, and about 8% had the pain in the last 6 months.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reed |first1=BD |last2=Crawford |first2=S |last3=Couper |first3=M |last4=Cave |first4=C |year=2004 |title=Pain at the vulvar vestibule: a web-based survey. |journal=Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=48–57 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://journals.lww.com/jlgtd/Abstract/2004/01000/Pain_at_the_Vulvar_Vestibule__A_Web_Based_Survey.11.aspx |accessdate=April 20, 2012 }}</ref>
