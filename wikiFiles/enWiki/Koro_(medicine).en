'''Koro''' is a [[culture-specific syndrome]] in which an individual has an overpowering belief that his or her genitals (e.g., penis or female nipples) are retracting and will disappear, despite the lack of any true longstanding changes to the genitals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Koro|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/koro|publisher=dictionary.com|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref>  Koro is also known as '''shrinking penis''', and it is listed in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.

==Classification==
In [[DSM-IV-TR]], koro is listed as one of the entries in the Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes of Appendix I. The manual gives koro's definition as "a term, probably of Malaysian origin, that refers to an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in females, the vulva and nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death."<ref name = "DSM-IV-TR">{{cite book | last = American Psychiatric Association | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text revision | publisher = American Psychiatric Pub | year = 2000 | pages = 898–901 | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6}}</ref> Attempts have been made by numerous authors to place koro into different classes.  For example, koro may fit into the group of "specific culture-imposed [[nosophobia]]" (classification with cardinal sign),<ref>{{Citation | last = Yap | first = Pow-Meng | title = Classification of the Culture-Bound Reactive Syndromes | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 172–9 | year = 1967 | issn = 0004-8674}}</ref> "the genital retraction taxon" (classification with common factors between syndromes),<ref name = "Simons & Hughes 1985">{{cite book | last = Simons | first = Ronald C. | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Charles C. | title = The Culture-bound syndromes: Folk Illnesses of Psychiatric and Anthropological Interest | publisher = D.

[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] recognises koro as a sexual disease and classifies it into two categories, namely "cold conglomeration in [[liver]]" and "depletion of [[kidney]]'s [[yin and yang|yang]]".<ref>{{Citation | last = Wang | first = Minghui | last2 = Wang | first2 = Fenglei | title = Conceptualisation and treatment of koro in traditional Chinese medicine | journal = The Chinese Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 559–61 | date = March 2002 | language = Chinese | issn = 1672-1993}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Most patients report acute anxiety attacks due to perceived genital retraction and/or genital shrinkage, despite any objectively visible biological changes in the genitalia that are longstanding.  "Longstanding" refers to changes that are sustained over a significant period of time and do not appear reversible, unlike the effect of cold temperatures on some genital regions that cause retraction.  These changes may trigger a koro attack when observed, although the effects of cold temperatures are objectively reversible.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ngui | first = P.

In cases when sufferers have no perception of retraction, some patients may complain of genital [[paraesthesia]] or genital shortening.<ref>{{Citation | last = Chowdhury | first = Arabinda N. | title = Clinical Analysis of 101 Koro Cases | journal = Indian Journal of Social Psychiatry | volume = 8 | pages = 67–70 | year = 1992}}</ref> Among females, the cardinal symptom is nipple retraction in the breast, generally into the breast as a whole.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/>

Psychological components of koro [[anxiety]] include fear of impending death and penile dissolution and loss of sexual power.<ref>Mattelaer, J. and Jilek, W. (2007, September). Koro—The psychological disappearance of the penis. Retrieved March 5, 2013 from Ebscohost Database.[ http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&sid=0d3bfe6e-d98c-4a3c-80dd-d0f697cf6987%40sessionmgr4&hid=2&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2007-12836-027]</ref> <ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/> Feelings of impending death along with retraction and perceived [[spermatorrhea]] has a strong cultural link with Chinese traditional beliefs.  This is demonstrated by the fact that Asians generally believe Koro symptoms are fatal, unlike most patients in the West.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/><ref name = "Cheng 1996"/> Other ideational themes are intra-abdominal organ shrinkage, sex change to female or [[eunuch]], non-specific physical danger, [[urinary obstruction]], [[Infertility|sterility]], impending madness, spirit possession and a feeling of being bewitched.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/>

Extremely anxious sufferers and their family members may resort to physical methods to prevent the believed retraction of the penis. A man may perform manual or mechanical penile traction, or "anchoring" by a loop of string or some clamping device.<ref name = "Gwee 1963">{{Citation | last = Gwee | first = Ah Leng | title = Koro — A Cultural Disease | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | volume = 4 | pages = 119–22 | year = 1963}}</ref> Similarly, a woman may be seen grabbing her own breast, pulling her nipple, or even having iron pins inserted into the nipple.<ref name = "Cheng 1996"/> Physical injury may occur from these attempts.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/> These forceful attempts often lead to injuries, even death.<ref>{{Citation | last = Garlipp | first = Petra | title = Koro – a Culture-Bound Phenomenon Intercultural Psychiatric Implications | journal = German Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 11  | pages = 21–8 | year = 2008 | issn = 1433-1055}}</ref>

==Causes==
Psychosexual conflicts, personality factors, and cultural beliefs are considered as being of [[etiological]]
significance to koro.<ref name = "Adeniran 1994"/> Sexual adjustment histories of non-Chinese victims are often significant, such as [[premorbidity|premorbid]] sex inadequacy, [[sexual promiscuity]], guilt over [[masturbation]], and [[impotence]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Berrios | first = G.

===Diagnosis===
Several criteria are typically used to make a diagnosis of koro.  The primary criteria is a patient's report of genital (typically penile or female nipple) retraction despite a lack of objective physical evidence demonstrating retraction.  This is accompanied by severe anxiety related to the retraction, fear of death as a result of retraction, and use of mechanical means to prevent retraction.<ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005">{{Citation | last = Dzokkoto | first = Vivian Afi | last2 = Adams | first2 = Glenn | title = Understanding genital-shrinking epidemics in West Africa : koro, juju or mass psychogenic illness? | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 53–78 | year = 2005 | issn = 0165-005X}}</ref> Cases that do not meet all the requirements are generally classified as koro-like symptoms or given a diagnosis of partial koro syndrome.<ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/> It has been argued that the criteria are sufficient but not necessary to make a diagnosis of koro.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/>  Researchers have identified Koro as a possible "cultural relative" of [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]].  [[DSM-IV]] explains the process of [[differential diagnosis]] between these two disorders.<ref name="dsm5.org"/>

===Exam===
A full medical, psychosexual and psychiatric history should be documented. The physician should explore the patient’s concerns about appearance and body image (ruling out [[body dysmorphic disorder]]).  Additionally, the physician should inquire about overall beliefs, personal values, and assumptions that the patient is making about his or her genitals.  Given that Koro is often an “attack” with a great deal of associated anxiety, the physician should ascertain the patient’s emotional state along with the timeline from onset to the presentation at the examination.<ref>Berrios GE, Morley SJ. Koro-like symptom in a non-Chinese subject. Br J Psychiatry 1984;145: 331–4.</ref><ref name="Wylie, K. R. 2007">Wylie, K. R., & Eardley, I. (2007).

A physical examination should involve an assessment of overall health along with a detailed genital examination.  In men, genital examination should be performed immediately after penile exposure, to avoid changes due to external temperature.  The primary intent of the male exam is to exclude genuine penile anomalies such as [[hypospadias]], [[epispadias]] and [[Peyronie's disease]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Wylie, K. R. 2007"/> The presence of a significant suprapubic fat pad should be noted as well.<ref name="Elder JS PC">Elder JS. Congenital anomalies of the genitalia. In:Walsh PC,Retik AB, Walsh PC, Campbell MF, eds. Campell’s urology. Philadelphia, London, Toronto: W.B. Saunders Comp.; 1998: 2120–43.</ref> Careful measurements of flaccid length, stretched length and flaccid girth will also be useful. If male patients insist that their penis is shrinking and disappearing,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> measurements after intracavernosal [[alprostadil]] may be used in the office to determine the true erect length and to diagnose any penile abnormalities in the erect state.<ref name="Wylie, K. R. 2007"/>  A physical examination should note any injuries inflicted by the patient in an effort to "prevent" retraction as further confirmation of Koro.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Differential diagnosis===
Men who present with this complaint may have Koro, but they may also be misinformed about normal genital size.<ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/>  Additionally, they may be suffering from penile dysmorphophobia.<ref>Spyropoulos E, Christoforidisb C, Borousasa D, Mavrikosa S, Bourounisa M, Athanasiadisa S. Augmentation phalloplasty surgery for penile dysmorphophobia in young adults: Considerations regarding patient selection, outcome evaluation and techniques applied. Eur Urol 2005;48:121–8.</ref> Penile dysmorphophobia is related to [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (Text Revision) ([[DSM-IV]]-TR) as a condition marked by excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a facial feature or localized part of the body. BDD is different from Koro.  In Koro, a patient is overcome with the belief that his penis is actively shrinking, and it may be in imminent danger of disappearing.<ref>Ang PC, Weller MP. Koro and psychosis. Br J Psychiatry 1984;145:335.</ref> Clinical literature indicates that these two psychological conditions should be separated during [[differential diagnosis]].<ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/>

In addition to differentiating Koro from [[body dysmorphic disorder]], physicians also recommend that [[differential diagnosis]] separates Koro from physical urological abnormalities.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/><ref>Kim J, Kim M, Lee N, Park Y. A case of urethrocutaneous fistula with the koro syndrome. J Urol 2000;164:123.</ref> For example, one physical disorder that causes loss of penile size is [[Peyronie's disease]], where the [[tunica albuginea]] develops scar tissue that prevents the full expansion of an erection and causes flaccid penis retraction.<ref>Brock, Gerald, et al. "The anatomy of the tunica albuginea in the normal penis and Peyronie's disease." The Journal of urology 157.1 (1997): 276-281.</ref><ref>Greenfield, Jason M., Steven Lucas, and Laurence A. Levine. "Factors affecting the loss of length associated with tunica albuginea plication for correction of penile curvature."

==Treatment==

===Therapy===
In historical culture-bound cases, reassurance and talks on [[sexual anatomy]] are given.<ref name = "Gwee 1963"/> Patients are treated with [[psychotherapy]] distributed according to symptoms and to etiologically significant points in the past. Prognosis appears to be better in cases with a previously functional personality, a short history and low frequency of attacks, and a relatively uncomplicated sexual life.<ref name = "Yap 1965"/>

For sporadic Western cases, careful diagnostic workup including searching for underlying sexual conflict is common. The choice of psychotherapeutic treatment is based on the psychiatric pathology found.<ref> Fishbain, D., Barsky, S., and Goldberg, M.

===Indigenous treatment===
In China, traditional treatment based on the causes suggested by cultural beliefs are administrated to the patient. Praying to gods and asking Taoist priests to perform exorcism is common. If a [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] is believed to be involved, people may hit [[gong]]s or beat the person to drive it out. The person will receive a yang- or yin-augmenting Chinese medicine potion, usually including herbs, animal penises (of [[tiger]], [[deer]] and [[fur seal]]), pilose antler (stag of deer) or deer tail. Other foods for therapy are pepper soup, ginger soup and [[liquor]].<ref name = "Cheng 1996"/>

==Epidemiology==
Among the Chinese, koro is confined to [[Northern and southern China|South China]] and the lower [[Yangtze Valley]].<ref name = "Yap 1965"/> A 1992 study of self-report questionnaires suggests that in the epidemic area of China, koro victims are mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], male, young, single, poorly educated and fearful of [[supernatural|supernatural forces]] and koro.<ref name = "Cheng 1996"/> The phenomenon is also found among oversea Chinese in [[Southeast Asia]], especially [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], and less frequently among the [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian]] inhabitants of the countries.<ref name = "Yap 1965"/> Though there are speculations that the occurrence of koro among people in Malaysia and Indonesia was the result of Chinese migrants, this cultural diffusion view is challenged since koro epidemics have been reported in [[Thailand]] and India, involving masses of non-Chinese people.<ref name = "Tseng 2006">{{Citation | last = Tseng | first = W.

==History==

===China===
Most of the ancient literature concerning koro was related to Chinese ethnic groups. For example, koro (in its Chinese term of ''shuk yang'') is documented in the old medical book ''New Collection of remedies of value'' ({{zh|t=驗方新篇|s=验方新篇}}) which was published in [[Qing Dynasty]]. The book described the condition as "[[Yin and yang|yin]] type of [[qi|cold qi]] invasion" ({{zh|t=陰症傷寒|s=阴症伤寒}}) which involved a sudden [[seizure]] during [[sexual intercourse]] with the penis retracting into the abdomen. It ascertains that the patient will die if not treated with "heaty" drugs on time.<ref name = "Gwee 1963"/>

Local official records indicate genital retraction endemics in [[Hainan Island]] and [[Leizhou Peninsula]] in [[Guangdong]], China, as early as the late 19th century. There were a series of epidemic outbursts in 1948, 1955, 1966, and 1974, whenever there was social tension or impending disaster, followed by the last widespread episode in 1984–1985 and a much smaller outbreak in 1987. The 1984–1985 epidemics lasted for over a year and affected over 3,000 persons in 16 cities and counties. A mental health campaign was conducted for the epidemic and since then no further episodes of the epidemic has occurred in China. Improvement in local economic conditions, associated with a better quality of life, is suggested to contribute to the fading of the episodic occurrences of koro.<ref name = "Cheng 1996"/><ref name = "Tseng 2006"/>

===Southeast Asia===
A koro epidemic struck [[Singapore]] in October 1967 for about ten days. Newspapers initially reported that some people developed koro after eating the meat of pigs inoculated with anti-[[swine-flu]] [[vaccine]]. Rumours relating eating pork and koro spread after a further report of an inoculated pig dying from penile retraction. The cases reported amounted to 97 in a single hospital unit within one day, at five days after the original news report. Government and medical officials alleviated the outbreak only by public announcements over television and in the newspapers.<ref>{{Citation | author = Koro study team | title = The Koro "Epidemic" in Singapore | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 234–42 | date = December 1969 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Ng | first = B. Y. | title = History of Koro in Singapore | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 8 | pages = 356–7 | date = August 1969 }}</ref>

An epidemic outbreak in November 1976 in [[Northeast Thailand]] caused at least 350 cases, most of them Thai and males. Popular opinion and news media echoed the victims' projection of viewing the epidemic as caused by Vietnamese food and tobacco poisoning in a hideous assault against the Thai people.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"/><ref>{{Citation | last = Jilek | first = W. | last2 = Jilel-Aall | first2 = L. | title = Mass-hysteria with Koro-symptoms in Thailand | journal = Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–9 | year = 1977}}</ref> Another large-scale epidemic in Thailand occurred in 1982.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"/>

In 1982, a koro epidemic episode in [[Northeast India]] affected, in majority, poorly educated people from lower socio-economic strata. There was no evidence of significant premorbid or sexual psychopathology in most cases.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sachdev | first = P.

=== Africa ===
In the 1970s and early 1980s, newspapers reported incidents of genital shrinking in Western Nigeria. Since late 1996, a small-scale epidemic of genital shrinking was reported in West African nations. Victims in the African outbreaks often interpreted the experience as genital theft, accusing someone with whom they had contact of "stealing" the organ and the spiritual essence, causing impotence. The perceived motive for theft was associated with local [[occult]] belief, the [[witchcraft]] of [[juju]], to feed the spiritual agency or to hold the genital for ransom.

Comparing West African genital-shrinking epidemics with koro in Southeast Asia, the latter has symptoms centered on genital retraction (instead of shrinkage) and fear of death (which is absent in African cases).<ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/> A study analyzing the West African epidemics from 1997 to 2003 concluded that rather than [[psychopathology]], the episodes were product of normal psychological functioning in undisturbed individuals, who were influenced by the local cultural models or social representations.<ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/>

===U.S. and Europe===
In the late Middle Ages in Europe, it was believed that men could lose their penises through magical attacks by witches<ref name="MattelaerJilek2007" /> The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', a 15th century European manual for witchcraft investigations, relates stories of men claiming that their genitals had disappeared, being "hidden by the devil … so that they can be neither seen nor felt." They were said to have reappeared after the men had appeased the witches responsible.<ref name=malleus>[http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/?p=39 ''Malleus Maleficarum'' Part II, Question I, Chapter VII]</ref> Witches were also said to store the removed genitals in birds' nests or in boxes, where "they move themselves like living members and eat oats and corn".<ref name=malleus/>

At least three publications of the 1880s, from U.S., Russia and England, reported genital retraction pathology, without using the Malay or Chinese term. Koro epidemics in China were first noticed in a French report in 1908 and descriptions of koro entered clinical books of western medicine in 1936. In the 1950s, koro is noted in [[nosological]] and diagnostic psychiatry.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"/>

==Society and culture==

===Name origin===
The earliest Western reference to the term ''koro'' is found in B.F. Matthes' ''Dictionary of [[Buginese language|Buginese Language]]'' (1874) of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].<ref name = "Chowdhury 1998">{{Citation | last = Chowdhury | first = Arabinda N. | title = Hundred Years of Koro: The History of a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = The International Journal of Social Psychiatry | volume = 44 |issue = 3| pages = 181–8 | date = September 1998 | issn = 0020-7640}}</ref> The word is also used in [[Makassarese language]], meaning "to shrink"; the full expression is ''garring koro''.<ref name = "Chowdhury 1996">{{Citation | last = Chowdhury | first = Arabinda N. | title = The definition and classification of Koro | journal = Culture, Medicine & Psychiatry | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 41–65 | date = March 1996 | issn = 0165-005X}}</ref> In [[Malaysian language|Malay]], ''keruk'' is the probable linguistic link of koro which means "to shrink",<ref>{{Citation | last = Palthe | first = W. P. M. van | title = Koro, een Eigenaardige Angstneurose | journal = Geneeskundig Tijdeschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indie | volume = 74 | pages = 1713–1720 | year = 1934}}</ref> and ''koro'' may also be derived from some Malay terms which are associated with "head of turtle".<ref> Cheng, S. (March, 1996). A Critical review of Chinese koro. Retrieved March 25, 2013 from EBSCOhost.

===Cultural beliefs===
Factors of cultural expectation in the genesis of koro can be built upon ideas of sex physiology in the [[traditional Chinese medicine]], with free play of imagination which links fatality with genital retraction.<ref name = "Gwee 1963"/>

In the ancient Chinese medical book ''Zhong Zang Jing'' ({{zh|t=中藏經|s=中藏经}}), retraction of the penis with distension of the abdomen was described as a certain sign of death.<ref name = "Gwee 1963"/> The [[yin and yang]] theory proposes that an unbalanced loss of the yang humour produces genital shrinkage.<ref name = "Yap 1965"/>

In [[Taoism]] and Traditional Chinese medicine, frequent [[ejaculation]] is regarded as detrimental to health, as [[semen]] is considered to be related to a man's vital energy, and hence excessive depletion of semen may lead to illness or death. Some authors believe that the idea of death caused by the semen depletion resembles the idea of death caused by genital disappearance, although such linkage between koro and Taoism, which influences Chinese medicine to some degree, is only speculative.<ref name = "Cheng 1996"/>

The popularity of [[Chinese folklore]] also plays a role. The novel about ghost stories ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' describes a [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] which can make people weak physically and sexually and shrink their tissues. Belief in koro being caused by the fox ghost among the southern Chinese has been reported.<ref name = "Cheng 1996"/>
