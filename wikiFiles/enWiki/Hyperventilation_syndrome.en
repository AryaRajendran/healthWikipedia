'''Hyperventilation syndrome''' ('''HVS'''; also '''chronic hyperventilation syndrome''' or '''CHVS''') is a respiratory disorder, psychologically or physiologically based, involving breathing too deeply or too rapidly ([[hyperventilation]]).  HVS may present with [[chest pain]] and a tingling sensation in the fingertips and around the mouth ([[paresthesia]]) and may accompany a [[panic attack]]. 

People with HVS may feel that they cannot get enough air. In reality, they have about the same oxygenation in the arterial blood (normal values are about 98% for hemoglobin saturation) and too little [[carbon dioxide]] in their blood and other tissues.  While oxygen is abundant in the bloodstream, HVS reduces effective delivery of that oxygen to vital organs due to low-{{Co2}}-induced [[vasoconstriction]] and the suppressed [[Bohr effect]]. 

The hyperventilation is self-promulgating as rapid breathing causes carbon dioxide levels to fall below healthy levels, and [[respiratory alkalosis]] (high blood [[pH]]) develops. This makes the symptoms worse, which causes the person to try breathing even faster, which further exacerbates the problem.  

The respiratory alkalosis leads to changes in the way the [[nervous system]] fires and leads to the [[paresthesia]], dizziness, and perceptual changes that often accompany this condition.  Other mechanisms may also be at work, and some people are physiologically more susceptible to this phenomenon than others.<ref name="titleeMedicine - Hyperventilation Syndrome: Article by Edward Newton, MD">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic270.htm |title=eMedicine - Hyperventilation Syndrome: Article by Edward Newton, MD |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=}}</ref>

==Causes==
Hyperventilation syndrome is believed to be caused by psychological factors and by definition has no organic cause.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shu|first=BC|coauthors=Chang, YY, Lee, FY, Tzeng, DS, Lin, HY, Lung, FW|title=Parental attachment, premorbid personality, and mental health in young males with hyperventilation syndrome.|journal=Psychiatry Research|date=2007-10-31|volume=153|issue=2|pages=163–70|pmid=17659783|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.006}}</ref> It is one cause of [[hyperventilation]] with others including infection, blood loss, [[heart attack]],<ref name="titleHyperventilation">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hyperventilation/article_em.htm |title=Hyperventilation |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}</ref> [[hypercapnia]] or [[alkalosis]] due to chemical imbalances, decreased cerebral blood flow, and increased nerve sensitivity may also underlie this symptom.<ref name="titleNeurology - Hyperventilation Syndrome | Brad McKechnie, DC, DACAN">{{cite web |url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/12/04/03.html |title=Neurology - Hyperventilation Syndrome &#124; Brad McKechnie, DC, DACAN |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}</ref>

In one study, one third of patients with HVS had "subtle but definite lung disease" that prompted them to breathe too frequently or too deeply.<ref name="isbn0-300-07401-8">{{cite book |author=Natelson, Benjamin H. |title=Facing and fighting fatigue: a practical approach |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1998 |pages=40 |isbn=0-300-07401-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Many people with [[panic disorder]] or [[agoraphobia]] will experience HVS. However, most people with HVS do not have these disorders.<ref name="titleeMedicine - Hyperventilation Syndrome: Article by Edward Newton, MD">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic270.htm |title=eMedicine - Hyperventilation Syndrome: Article by Edward Newton, MD |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Hyperventilation syndrome is a remarkably common cause of dizziness complaints. About 25% of patients who complain about dizziness are diagnosed with HVS.<ref name="titleNeurology - Hyperventilation Syndrome | Brad McKechnie, DC, DACAN">{{cite web |url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/12/04/03.html |title=Hyperventilation Syndrome - chiroweb.com &#124; Brad McKechnie, DC, DACAN |accessdate=2007-12-20 |work=}}</ref>  

A diagnostic Nijmegen Questionnaire provides an accurate diagnosis of Hyperventilation without triggering symptoms.  It has been used extensively in many scientific studies {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. 

The standard diagnostic technique is to have the patient breathe rapidly for two minutes. This will trigger the symptoms and convince the patient that overbreathing is responsible for the symptoms. This test can only be performed at a time when the patient is not already experiencing symptoms.

==Treatment==
While traditional intervention for an acute episode has been to have the patient breathe into a paper bag, causing [[rebreathing]] and restoration of CO₂ levels, this is not advised or taught.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bergeron |first1=J. David |last2=Le Baudour |first2=Chris |title=First Responder |accessdate=11 August 2010 |edition=8 |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-614059-7 |page=262 |chapter=Chapter 9: Caring for Medical Emergencies |quote= Do not use a paper bag in an attempt to treat hyperventilation. These patients can often be cared for with low-flow oxygen and lots of reassurance}}</ref> When patients hyperventilate, they change their blood chemistry toward alkalosis.  In alkalosis, hemoglobin binds more securely to the oxygen ('alkalotic O₂ clamping', also called the '[[Bohr effect]]'), so the patient's cells become relatively hypoxic. Restricting inspired oxygen worsens this hypoxia and is detrimental to the patient. If attempting to calm the patient does not work within a few minutes, and the patient's condition is deteriorating, the hyperventilation may be caused by a medical condition (some of which are life threatening such as head injuries or drug overdose).

The same benefits can be obtained more safely from deliberately slowing down the breathing rate by [[counting]] or looking at the second hand on a [[watch]]. This is sometimes referred to as "7-11 breathing", because a gentle inhalation is stretched out to take 7 seconds (or counts), and the exhalation is slowed to take 11 seconds. This in-/exhalation ratio can be safely decreased to 4-12 or even 4-20 and more, as the O₂ content of the blood will easily sustain normal cell function for several minutes) at rest when normal blood acidity has been restored.

Most patients benefit from carefully, deliberately slowing down their breathing twice a day for five minutes at a time.<ref name="titleNeurology - Hyperventilation Syndrome | Brad McKechnie, DC, DACAN"/> The goal is to reduce breathing to no more than five breaths per minute. This helps retrain their habits and convince them that faster breathing is unnecessary.

The original traditional treatment of breathing into a paper bag to control psychologically based hyperventilation syndrome (which is now almost universally known and often shown in movies and TV dramas) was invented by New York City physician (later [[radiologist]]), [[Alexander Winter]], M.D. [1908-1978], based on his experiences in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Medical Corps]] during [[World War II]] and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Winter|first=A|title=A Rapid Emergency Treatment for Hyperventilation Syndrome.|journal=J Am Med Assoc|date=1951|volume=147|issue=10|pages=990|doi=10.1001/jama.1951.03670270080028|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/search?fulltext=alexander+winter+hyperventilation&submit=yes&x=0&y=0 }}</ref>
