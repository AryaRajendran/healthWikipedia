A '''neurological examination''' is the assessment of [[sensory neuron]] and [[motor neuron|motor]] responses, especially [[reflex]]es, to determine whether the [[nervous system]] is impaired.<ref name="suffolk">{{cite web | title = Terminology | url=http://www.suffolk.edu/campuslife/11495.html | accessdate = 2008-04-22 }}</ref> This typically includes a [[physical examination]] and a review of the patient's [[medical history]] but not deeper investigation such as [[neuroimaging]]. It can be used both as a screening tool and as an investigative tool, the former of which when examining the patient when there is no expected neurological deficit and the latter of which when examining a patient where you do expect to find abnormalities.<ref name="NEME">{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Geraint | title = Neurological Examination Made Easy | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-443-07420-8 | page = 1 }}</ref> If a problem is found either in an investigative or screening process then further tests can be carried out to focus on a particular aspect of the nervous system (such as [[lumbar puncture]]s and [[blood test]]s).

Generally a neurological examination is focused towards finding out if there are [[lesion]]s in the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s or whether there is another diffuse process which is troubling the patient.<ref name="NEME"/> Once the patient has been thoroughly tested, it is then the role of the [[physician]] to determine whether these findings combine to form a recognizable medical syndrome or [[neurological disorder]] such as [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[motor neurone disease]].<ref name="NEME"/> Finally, it is the role of the physician to find the etiological reasons for why such a problem has occurred, for example finding if the problem was due to inflammation or congenital.<ref name="NEME"/>

==Indications==
A neurological examination is indicated whenever a physician suspects that a patient may have a [[neurological disorder]]. Any new symptom of any neurological order may be an indication for performing a neurological examination.

==Patient's history==
A patient's history is the most important part of a neurological examination<ref name="NEME"/> and must be performed before any other procedures unless impossible (i.e. the patient is unconscious Certain aspects of a patient's history will become more important depending upon the complaint issued).<ref name="NEME"/> Important factors to be taken in the medical history include:

:*Time of onset, duration and associated symptoms (e.g. is the complaint [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] or [[acute (medicine)|acute]])<ref name="emedicine">{{cite web | last = Oommen | first = Kalarickal | title = Neurological History and Physical Examination | url=http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic632.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-22 }}</ref>
:*Age, gender, and occupation of the patient<ref name="NEME"/>
:*Handedness (right- or left-handed)
:*Past medical history<ref name="NEME"/>
:*Drug history<ref name="NEME"/>
:*Family and social history<ref name="NEME"/>

Handedness is important in establishing the area of the brain important for language (as almost all right-handed people have a [[left hemisphere]] which is responsible for language). As patients answer questions, it is important to gain an idea of the complaint thoroughly and understand its time course. Understanding the patient's neurological state at the time of questioning is important, and an idea should be obtained of how competent the patient is with various tasks and their level of impairment in carrying out these tasks. The interval of a complaint is important as it can help aid the diagnosis. For example, [[vascular]] disorders (such as strokes) occur very frequently over minutes or hours, whereas chronic disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease) occur over a matter of years.<ref name="NEME"/>

Carrying out a 'general' examination is just as important as the neurological exam as it may lead to clues to the etiology of the complaint. This is shown by cases of [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[metastasis|metastases]] where the initial complaint was of a mass in the [[breast]].<ref name="NEME"/>

==List of tests==
Specific tests in a neurological examination include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Category
! Tests
! Example of writeup
|-
| [[Mental status examination]]
| 
* The assessment of [[consciousness]], often using the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (EMV)
* [[Mental status examination]], often including the [[abbreviated mental test score]] (AMTS) or [[mini mental state examination]] (MMSE)
* Global assessment of higher functions
* [[Intracranial pressure]] is roughly estimated by [[fundoscopy]]; this also enables assessment for [[microvascular disease]].
| "A&O x 3, short and [[long-term memory]] intact"
|-
| [[Cranial nerve examination]]
| [[Cranial nerves]] (I-XII): sense of smell (I), visual fields and acuity (II), eye movements (III, IV, VI) and pupils (III, sympathetic and parasympathetic), sensory function of face (V), strength of facial (VII) and shoulder girdle muscles (XI), hearing (VII, VIII), taste (VII, IX, X), pharyngeal movement and reflex (IX), tongue movements (XII). These are tested by their individual purposes (e.g. the visual acuity can be tested by a [[Snellen chart]]).
| "CNII-XII grossly intact"
|-
| [[Motor system]]
| 
* [[Muscle]] strength, often graded on the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]] scale 0 to 5<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Medical Research Council|title=Medical Research Council scale. Aids to examination of the peripheral nervous system. Memorandum no. 45.|year=1976}}</ref> (i.e. 0 = Complete Paralysis to 5 = Normal Power).
** grades 4 -, 4 and 4+ maybe used to indicate movement against slight, moderate and strong resistance respectively.
* Muscle tone and signs of [[rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]].

*Examination of [[Abnormal posturing|posture]]
**[[Decerebrate]]
**[[Decorticate]]
**[[Hemiparetic]]
* Resting [[tremor]]s
*Abnormal movements
**[[Seizure]]
**[[Fasciculation]]s

**Tone
***[[Spasticity]]
****[[Pronator drift]]
***Rigidity
****Cogwheeling (abnormal tone suggestive of Parkinson's disease)
****''Gegenhalten'' - is resistance to passive change, where the strength of antagonist muscles increases with increasing examiner force. More common in dementia.

| "strength 5/5 throughout, tone WNL"
|-
| [[Deep tendon reflex]]es
| [[Reflex action|Reflexes]]: masseter, biceps and triceps tendon, knee tendon, ankle jerk and [[plantar reflex|plantar]] (i.e. [[Babinski sign]]). Globally, brisk reflexes suggest an abnormality of the [[Upper motor neuron|UMN]] or [[pyramidal tract]], while decreased reflexes suggest abnormality in the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|anterior horn]], [[lower motor neuron|LMN]], [[nerve]] or [[motor end plate]].  A [[reflex hammer]] is used for this testing.
| "2+ symmetric, downgoing [[plantar reflex]]"
|-
| [[Sensation (psychology)|Sensation]]
| 
[[Sensory system]] testing involves provoking sensations of fine touch, pain and temperature. Fine touch can be evaluated with a ''monofilament test'', touching various [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]]s with a nylon monofilament to detect any subjective absence of touch perception.

*Sensory
** Light touch
** Pain
** Temperature
** Vibration
** Position sense
** [[Graphesthesia]]
** [[Stereognosis]], and
** [[Two-point discrimination]] (for [[discriminative sense]])
** Extinction
** [[Romberg test]] - 2 out of the following 3 must be intact to maintain balance: i. vision  ii. vestibulocochlear system  iii. epicritic sensation

| "intact to sharp and dull throughout"
|-
| [[Cerebellum]]
| 
*Cerebellar testing
** [[Dysmetria]]
*** Finger-to-nose test
*** Ankle-over-tibia test
** [[Dysdiadochokinesis]]
*** Rapid [[pronation]]-[[supination]]
**Ataxia
*** Assessment of gait
**Nystagmus
**Intention tremor
**Staccato speech
| "intact [[Dysmetria|finger-to-nose]], [[gait]] WNL"

==Interpretation==
The results of the examination are taken together to anatomically identify the ''lesion''. This may be diffuse (e.g. neuromuscular diseases, encephalopathy) or highly specific (e.g. abnormal sensation in one [[Dermatomic area|dermatome]] due to compression of a specific spinal nerve by a tumor deposit).

*Looking for side to side symmetry: one side of the body serves as a control for the other. Determining if there is focal asymmetry.
* Determining if the process involves the peripheral nervous system (PNS), central nervous system (CNS) or both. Considering if the finding (or findings) can be explained by a single lesion or whether it requires a multifocal process.
* Establishing the lesion's location.  If the process involves the CNS, clarifying if it is cortical, subcortical, or multifocal. If subcortical, clarifying if it is white matter, basal ganglia, brain stem or spinal cord. If the process involves the PNS then determining if it localizes to the nerve root, plexus, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle or if it is multifocal.

A [[differential diagnosis]] may then be constructed that takes into account the patient's background (e.g. previous cancer, autoimmune diathesis) and present findings to include the most likely causes. Examinations are aimed at ruling out the most clinically significant causes (even if relatively rare, e.g. brain tumor in a patient with subtle word finding abnormalities but no increased [[intracranial pressure]]) and ruling ''in'' the most likely causes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
