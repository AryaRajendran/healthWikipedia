'''Monkeypox''' is an exotic [[infectious disease]] caused by the monkeypox virus.  The disease was first identified in laboratory [[monkey]]s, hence its name, but in its natural state it seems to infect [[rodent]]s more often than [[primate]]s. The disease is indigenous to [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]]. An outbreak that occurred in the United States in 2003 was traced to a pet store where imported [[Gambian pouched rat]]s were sold. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5227a5.htm |title=Update: Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox - Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, 2003 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>

Monkeypox virus is a [[zoonotic]] [[Virus|viral]] disease that occurs primarily in remote villages of Central and West [[Africa]] in proximity to [[tropical rainforest]]s where there is more frequent contact with infected animals. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans from [[rodent]]s, pets, and [[primate]]s through contact with the animal's [[blood]] or through a bite. Human monkeypox can be difficult to distinguish clinically from [[smallpox]] (to which it is closely related) and [[chickenpox]] (to which it is not).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jezek Z, Szczeniowski M, Paluku KM, Mutombo M, Grab B |title=Human monkeypox: confusion with chickenpox |journal=Acta Trop. |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=297–307 |year=1988 |pmid=2907258 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
In addition to monkeys, reservoirs for the virus are found in [[Gambian pouched rat]]s (''Cricetomys'' sp.), [[dormice]] (''[[Graphiurus]]'' sp.) and African squirrels (''[[Heliosciurus]]'', and ''[[Funisciurus]]''). The use of these animals as food may be an important source of transmission to humans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Monkeypox as a disease in humans was first associated with an illness in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly ''Zaire''), in the town of [[Basankusu]], [[Équateur]] Province, in 1970.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480792/ A human infection caused by monkeypox virus in [[Basankusu]] Territory, Democratic Republic of the Congo - I.

In 2003, a small outbreak of human monkeypox in the [[United States]] occurred among owners of pet [[prairie dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=What You Should Know About Monkeypox |work=Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Centers for disease control and prevention]] |date=2003-06-12 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/pdf/factsheet2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>  The outbreak originated from [[Villa Park, Illinois]], outside of Chicago, when an exotic animal dealer kept young prairie dogs in close proximity to an infected Gambian pouched rat  (Cricetomys gambianus) recently imported from West Africa.

A second African focus of infection has been discovered in [[Sudan]].

Monkeypox [[virus]] causes the disease in both [[humans]] and [[animal]]s. It was first identified in 1958 as a [[pathogen]] of [[Crab-eating Macaque|crab-eating macaque]] monkeys (''Macaca fascicularis'') being used as [[Animal testing|laboratory animals]].  The crab-eating macaque is often used for [[neurological]] experiments.  Monkeypox virus is an ''[[Orthopoxvirus]]'', a genus of the family ''[[Poxviridae]]'' that contains other viral species that target [[mammal]]s. The virus is mainly found in [[tropical rainforest]] regions of [[Central Africa|central]] and [[West Africa]].

The virus was first discovered in monkeys (hence the name) in 1958, and in humans in 1970. Between 1970 and 1986, over 400 cases in humans were reported.  Small viral outbreaks with a death rate in the range of 10% and a secondary human to human infection rate of about the same amount occur routinely in equatorial Central and West Africa.<ref name=Meyer2002>{{cite journal |last = Meyer |first = H. |coauthors = Mathilde Perrichot, Markus Stemmler, Petra Emmerich, Herbert Schmitz, Francis Varaine, Robert Shungu, Florimond Tshioko, and Pierre Formenty

The outbreak was traced to a [[prairie dog]]s infected from an imported [[Gambian pouch rat]].  No deaths occurred.

The virus can spread both from animal to human and from human to human. Infection from animal to human can occur via an animal bite or by direct contact with an infected animal’s bodily fluids. The virus can spread from human to human by both respiratory (airborne) contact and contact with infected person's bodily fluids. Incubation period is 10–14 days. Symptoms Prodromal symptoms include swelling of [[lymph]] nodes, muscle pain, headache, fever, prior to the emergence of the rash.

== Morbidity and Mortality ==
=== Symptoms and course ===
In humans, monkeypox is similar to [[smallpox]], although it is often milder. [[Vaccination]] against smallpox is assumed to provide protection against human monkeypox infection considering they are closely related viruses and the vaccine protects animals from experimental lethal monkeypox challenge.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marriott KA, Parkinson CV, Morefield SI, Davenport R, Nichols R, Monath TP |title=Clonal vaccinia virus grown in cell culture fully protects monkeys from lethal monkeypox challenge |journal=Vaccine |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=581–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18077063 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.10.063 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264-410X(07)01257-1}}</ref> This has not been conclusively demonstrated in humans because routine smallpox vaccination was discontinued following the apparent eradication of smallpox and due to safety concerns with the vaccine. Limited person-to-person spread of infection has been reported in disease-endemic areas in Africa. Case-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1% to 10%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hutin YJ, Williams RJ, Malfait P, ''et al.'' |title=Outbreak of human monkeypox, Democratic Republic of Congo, 1996 to 1997 |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=434–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11384521 |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutin.htm |pmc=2631782}}</ref>

=== Prevention and treatment ===
Currently, there is no proven, safe treatment for monkeypox. Smallpox vaccine has been reported to reduce the risk of monkeypox among previously vaccinated persons in Africa. The [[United States]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends that persons investigating monkeypox outbreaks and involved in caring for infected individuals or animals should receive a smallpox vaccination to protect against monkeypox. Persons who have had close or intimate contact with individuals or animals confirmed to have monkeypox should also be vaccinated. The people who have been infected can be vaccinated up to 14 days after exposure. CDC does not recommend preexposure vaccination for unexposed [[veterinarian]]s, veterinary staff, or animal control officers, unless such persons are involved in field investigations.

=== 2003 U.S. outbreak ===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}
Through June 18, 2003, 93 cases of monkeypox in the United States occurred in [[Wisconsin]] (44 cases), [[Indiana]] (24), [[Illinois]] (19), [[Ohio]] (4), [[Kansas]] (1), [[Missouri]] (1), and [[New Jersey]] (1). Analysis of the first 53 cases showed 50 had contact with prairie dogs that were purchased from Phil's Pocket Pets of [[Villa Park, Illinois]].<ref name="medscape">{{cite web|url=http://bcbsma.medscape.com/viewarticle/458671_11 |title=Medscape Monkeypox Review |publisher=Bcbsma.medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref> Electron microscopy and serologic studies were used to confirm that the disease was human monkeypox.

The onset of the illness among the patients in the United States began in early May 2003.<ref>Anderson MG, Frenkel LD, Homann S, and Guffey J. (2003), "A case of severe monkeypox virus disease in an American child: emerging infections and changing professional values"; ''[[Pediatr Infect Dis J]]'';22(12): 1093–1096; discussion 1096–1098.</ref> Patients typically experienced early symptoms (a [[prodrome]]) consisting of fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills, and drenching sweats. Roughly one-third of patients had nonproductive coughs. This prodromal phase was followed 1–10 days later by the development of a papular rash that typically progressed through stages of [[Cutaneous condition#Vesicle|vesiculation]], [[Pustule|pustulation]], [[Umbilication|umbilication]], and crusting. In some patients, early lesions had become ulcerated. Rash distribution and lesions occurred on head, trunk, and extremities; many of the patients had initial and satellite lesions on palms, soles, and extremities. Rashes were generalized in some patients. After onset of the rash, patients generally manifested rash lesions in different stages. All patients reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs, most of which were sick. Illness in prairie dogs was frequently reported as beginning with a [[Conjunctivitis|blepharoconjunctivitis]], progressing to presence of nodular lesions in some cases. Some prairie dogs died from the illness, while others reportedly recovered.
