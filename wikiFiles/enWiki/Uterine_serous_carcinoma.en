'''Uterine serous carcinoma''' (USC), also known as '''uterine papillary serous carcinoma''' (UPSC) and '''uterine serous adenocarcinoma''', is an uncommon form of [[endometrial cancer]] that typically arises in postmenopausal women.  

It is typically diagnosed on [[endometrial biopsy]], prompted by [[post-menopausal bleeding]].

Unlike the more common low-grade ''endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma'', USC does not develop from [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and is not hormone-sensitive. It arises in the setting of endometrial [[atrophy]] and is classified as a [[type II endometrial cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol |title=Hormonal heterogeneity of endometrial cancer. |author=Gründker C, Günthert AR, Emons G.|pmid=18637491 |year=2008 |volume=630 |pages=166–88 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-78818-0_11}}</ref>  

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Uterine serous carcinoma high mag.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Micrograph]] of '''uterine serous carcinoma''' demonstrating characteristic [[psammoma bodies]] and [[cilia]]. [[H&E stain]].]] 
The lesion is found in patients who present typically with abnormal or [[vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]. Such bleeding is followed by further evaluation leading to a tissue diagnosis, usually done by a [[dilatation and curettage]] (D&C). A work-up to follow would look for metastasis using imaging technology including sonography and MRI. The median age at diagnosis in a study of 138 women was 67 years, of these 54 had stage I, 20 stage II, 41 stage III, and 23 stage IV disease.<ref name=Goldberg/> 

[[Histopathological]]ly, uterine serous carcinomas is typically characterized by (1) nipple-shaped structures (papillae) with fibrovascular cores (2) marked nuclear atypia (irregularies in the nuclear membrane, enlarged nuclear size), (3) [[psammoma bodies]] and (4) [[cilia]].

==Prognosis==
Prognosis of  the UPSC  is affected by age, stage, and histology as well as treatment.<ref name=Goldberg>{{cite journal| journal=Gynecol Oncol |title=Outcome after combined modality treatment for uterine papillary serous carcinoma: a study by the Rare Cancer Network (RCN) |author=Goldberg H, Miller RC, Abdah-Bortnyak R, Steiner M, Yildiz F, Meirovitz A, Villà S, Poortmans PM, Azria D, Zidan J, Ozsahin M, Abacioglu U, Gold DG, Amit A, Lavie O, Atahan IL, Kuten A; Rare Cancer Network.|pmid=18096209| date=February 2008| volume=108| issue=2| pages=298–305| doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2007.10.037}}</ref>

===Staging===
[[Image:Serous carcinoma cytology.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing ([[malignant]]) peritoneal [[cytopathology]] ([[serous carcinoma]]), indicating at least Stage IIIA disease.]]
UPSC is staged like other forms of endometrial carcinoma at time of surgery using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] [[cancer staging]] system.
*Stage IA: tumor is limited to the endometrium
*Stage IB: invasion of less than half the [[myometrium]]
*Stage IC: invasion of more than half the myometrium
*Stage IIA: endocervical glandular involvement only
*Stage IIB: cervical stromal invasion
*Stage IIIA: tumor invades serosa or adnexa, or malignant peritoneal cytology
*Stage IIIB: vaginal metastasis
*Stage IIIC: metastasis to pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes
*Stage IVA: invasion of the bladder or bowel
*Stage IVB: distant metastasis, including intraabdominal or inguinal lymph nodes

===Survival===
In the older literature  survival rates have been given as 35–50% for Stage I–II and 0–15% for Stage III and IV UPSC,<ref name=sood/>  More recently it was reported that forty-two percent of 138 patients were found disease-free at five years.<ref name=Goldberg/>

In 2009, the journal of "[[Gynecologic Oncology (journal)|Gynecologic Oncology]]" reported the following 5-year survival rates based upon stage of cancer:

*Stage I: 50% - 80%
*Stage II: 50%
*Stage III: 20%
*Stage IV: 5% - 10% <ref>http://www.sgo.org/assets/0/58/62/AA0E178A-8533-4BCE-A64D-54000F01A21B.pdf</ref>

==Treatment==
The primary treatment is surgical. FIGO-[[cancer staging]] is done at the time of surgery which consists of peritoneal cytology, total [[hysterectomy]], bilateral [[salpingo-oophorectomy]], pelvic/para-aortic [[lymphadenectomy]], and [[omentectomy]].  The tumor is aggressive and spreads quickly into the [[myometrium]] and the [[lymphatic system]]. Thus even in presumed early stages, lymphadenectomy and omentectomy should be included in the surgical approach. If the tumor has spread surgery is cytoreductive followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.<ref name=sood>{{cite journal| journal= Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys |title=Patterns of failure after the multimodality treatment of uterine papillary serous carcinoma |author=Sood BM, Jones J, Gupta S, Khabele D, Guha C, Runowicz C, Goldberg G, Fields A, Anderson P, Vikram B. |pmid=12909235| date= September 2003| volume= 57| issue= 1| pages= 208–16}}</ref> 

In a study to determine if adjuvant therapy should be used in  patients with stage I UPSC who had undergone surgery, no increased survival was seen when [[radiation therapy]] was added versus observation, while the postsurgical treatment with chemotherapy may be beneficial but more data are needed.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Gynecol Oncol| title=Uterine papillary serous carcinoma: comparisons of outcomes in surgical Stage I patients with and without adjuvant therapy| author=Huh WK, Powell M, Leath CA 3rd, Straughn JM Jr, Cohn DE, Gold MA, Falkner CA, Carey DE, Herzog T, Fowler JM, Partridge EE, Kilgore LC, Alvarez RD.|pmid=14675664| year=2003| volume=91| issue=3| pages=470–5| doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2003.08.027}}</ref>
A study of the usefulness of [[platinum]]-based chemotherapy as an adjuvant after surgery of stage I patients showed that patients with stage 1A who had no residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen had no recurrence regardless if chemotherapy was used or not, however, patients with stage 1A disease with residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen had no recurrence with platinum-based therapy, but those who had no such chemotherapy showed recurrence in 43%. Similarly, patients with stage 1B disease with chemotherapy had no recurrence, while those without chemotherapy had a high degree (77%) of recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Gynecol Oncol |title=Improved survival in surgical stage I patients with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) treated with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy |author=Kelly MG, O'malley DM, Hui P, McAlpine J, Yu H, Rutherford TJ, Azodi M, Schwartz PE. |pmid=16005947 |year=2005 |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=353–9 |doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.06.012}}</ref>

===Trastuzumab===
In a recent study, about 60% of USCs were found to overexpress the protein [[HER2/neu]]--the same one that is overexpressed in some [[breast cancer]]s. The monoclonal antibody [[trastuzumab]] (Herceptin) is currently being tested as a therapy for this subset of USCs.<ref name=Santin08>{{cite journal |author=Santin AD, Bellone S, Roman JJ, McKenney JK, Pecorelli S.|title=Trastuzumab treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma overexpressing HER2/neu|journal= Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume= 102 |issue= 2 |pages= 128–31 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18555254 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.04.008}}</ref>

The antibody [[trastuzumab]] (Herceptin), which is used to treat breast cancers that overexpress the [[HER2/neu]] protein, has been tried with some success in a phase II trial in women with UPSCs that overexpress HER2/neu.<ref name=Santin08/>
