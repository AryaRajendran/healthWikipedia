'''Nephritis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[nephrons]] in the [[kidneys]]. ''Nephritis'' comes from [[Latin]], from [[Ancient Greek]] νεφρῖτις, from νεφρός "kidney" and -ῖτις, a feminine adjective ending.<ref>{{OED|nephritis}}</ref>

==Subtypes==
===By main location of inflammation===
* [[Glomerulonephritis]] is inflammation of the [[glomeruli]]. (When the term "nephritis" is used without qualification, this is often the condition meant.)
* [[Interstitial nephritis]] or [[tubulo-interstitial nephritis]] is inflammation of the spaces between [[renal tubule]]s.

===By cause===
Nephritis is often caused by infections, toxins, and [[auto-immune]] diseases. It can be caused by infection, but is most commonly caused by autoimmune disorders that affect the major organs. For example, those with lupus are at a much higher risk for developing nephritis. In rare cases nephritis can be genetically inherited, though it may not present in childhood. (But has been known to be diagnosed in young girls of teen years.)

* [[Pyelonephritis]] is inflammation that results from a [[urinary tract infection]] that reaches the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney.
* [[Lupus nephritis]] is an inflammation of the kidney caused by [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), a disease of the [[immune system]].
* ''Athletic nephritis'' is nephritis resulting from strenuous exercise. It may result in [[proteinuria]], [[hematuria]] and [[cylinduria]].<ref name=gardner/> In most persons these are transient findings that disappear within hours to days after the end of exercise.<ref name=gardner/> The findings generally increase by increasing severity and duration of physical stress.<ref name=gardner>{{cite pmid|5167442|noedit}}</ref> Hematuria after strenuous exercise may also result from [[march hemoglobinuria]], which is caused by trauma to [[red blood cell]]s, causing [[hemolysis]] and resultant release of hemoglobin into the blood.

==Complications==
Nephritis is the most common producer of glomerular injury.  It is a disturbance of the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation.  This can lead to reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output ([[oliguria]]) and retention of waste products ([[uremia]]).  As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood to appear in the urine ([[hematuria]]).  Low renal blood flow activates the [[Renin-angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]] (RAAS), causing fluid retention and mild hypertension.

Nephritis is a serious medical condition which is the eighth highest cause of human death. As the kidneys inflame, they begin to excrete needed protein from the body into the urine stream. This condition is called [[proteinuria]]. Loss of necessary protein due to nephritis can result in several life-threatening symptoms. Most dangerous in cases of nephritis is the loss of protein that keeps blood from clotting. This can result in blood clots causing sudden stroke.
