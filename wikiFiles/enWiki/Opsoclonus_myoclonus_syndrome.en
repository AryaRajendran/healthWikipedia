'''Opsoclonus Myoclonus Syndrome''' ('''OMS'''), also known as Opsoclonus-Myoclonus-Ataxia (OMA), is a rare [[neurological]] [[disease|disorder]] of unknown causes which appears to be the result of an [[autoimmune]] process involving the [[nervous system]]. It is an extremely rare condition, affecting as few as 1 in 10,000,000 people per year. It affects 2 to 3% of children with [[neuroblastoma]].

==Nomenclature==
OMS was first described by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]] in 1962.<ref name="Kinsbourne_1962">{{cite journal | author = Kinsbourne M | title = Myoclonic encephalopathy of infants | journal = J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–6 | year = 1962 | month = August | pmid = 21610907 | pmc = 495454 | doi =10.1136/jnnp.25.3.271 }}</ref> (The term 'Opsoclonus' was coined by Orzechowski in 1913, but it was classically described and associated with neuroblastoma by Kinsbourne). Other names for OMS include:
*Opsoclonus-Myoclonus-Ataxia (OMA)
*Paraneoplastic Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Ataxia (POMA)
*Kinsbourne syndrome
*Myoclonic Encephalopathy of Infants
*Dancing Eyes-Dancing Feet syndrome
*Dancing Eyes syndrome

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
[[Symptoms]] include:
*[[opsoclonus]] (rapid, involuntary, multivectorial (horizontal and vertical), unpredictable, conjugate fast eye movements without intersaccadic [quick rotation of the eyes] intervals)
*[[myoclonus]] (brief, involuntary twitching of a muscle or a group of muscles)
*[[ataxia|cerebellar ataxia]], both truncal and appendicular
*[[aphasia]] (a language disorder in which there is an impairment of speech and of comprehension of speech, caused by brain damage)
*[[mutism]] (a language disorder in which a person does not speak despite evidence of speech ability in the past, often part of a larger neurological or psychiatric disorder)
*[[lethargy]]
*[[Irritation|irritability]] or [[malaise]]
*[[drooling]]
*[[strabismus]] (a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other)
*[[vomiting]]
*sleep disturbances
*Abnormal urethral discharge

About half of all OMS cases occur in association with [[neuroblastoma]] (a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system usually occurring in infants and children).

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Because OMS is so rare and occurs at an average age of 19 months (6 to 36 months), a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] can be slow. Some cases have been misdiagnosed as having been caused by a [[virus]]. After a diagnosis of OMS is made, an associated neuroblastoma is discovered in half of cases, with median delay of 3 months.

==Cause==
In children, most cases are associated with neuroblastoma and most of the others are suspected to be associated with a low-grade neuroblastoma that spontaneously regressed before detection. In adults, most cases are associated with breast carcinoma or small-cell lung carcinoma.<ref name="urlMedLink">{{cite web | url = http://www.medlink.com/medlinkcontent.asp | title = Paraneoplastic opsoclonus in adults | author = Dropcho EJ  | work = Clinical summary | publisher = MedLink Corporation  | accessdate = 2012-05-18 }}</ref> It is one of the few [[paraneoplastic]] (meaning 'indirectly caused by cancer') syndromes that occurs in both children and adults, although the mechanism of immune dysfunction underlying the adult syndrome is probably quite different. 

It is hypothesized that a [[virus|viral]] infection (perhaps [[St. Louis encephalitis]], [[Epstein-Barr]], [[Coxsackie B]], or [[enterovirus]]) causes the remaining cases, though a direct connection has not been proven.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

OMS is not generally considered an [[infectious disease]]. OMS is not passed on genetically.

== Disease course and clinical subtypes ==
In most cases OMS starts with an acute flare-up of physical symptoms within days or weeks, but some less obvious symptoms such as irritability and [[malaise]] may begin weeks or months earlier.

==Prognosis==
Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response.

Tumors in children who develop OMA tend to be more mature, showing favorable histology and absence of n-myc oncogene amplification than similar tumors in children without symptoms of OMA.<ref name="pmid11344493">{{cite journal | author = Cooper R, Khakoo Y, Matthay KK, Lukens JN, Seeger RC, Stram DO, Gerbing RB, Nakagawa A, Shimada H | title = Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome in neuroblastoma: histopathologic features-a report from the Children's Cancer Group | journal = Med.

==Treatment==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
There is no known definitive cure for OMS. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in its treatment.

Some of medication used to treat the symptoms are:
* [[corticotropin|ACTH]] has shown improvements in symptoms but can result in an incomplete recovery with residual deficits.
*[[Corticosteroid]]s (such as ''[[prednisone]]'' or ''[[methylprednisolone]]'') used at high dosages (500&nbsp;mg - 2 g per day [[intravenous]]ly for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent very gradual tapering with pills generally follows. Most patients require high doses for months to years before tapering.
*[[Intravenous Immunoglobulin]]s (IVIg) are often used with varying results.
*Several other immunosuppressive drugs, such as [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[azathioprine]], may be helpful in some cases.
*Chemotherapy for [[neuroblastoma]] may be effective, although data is contradictory and unconvincing at this point in time.
*[[Rituximab]] has been used with encouraging results.<ref name="pmid15601813">{{cite journal | author = Pranzatelli MR, Tate ED, Travelstead AL, Longee D | title = Immunologic and clinical responses to rituximab in a child with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 1 | pages = e115–9 | year = 2005 | month = January | pmid = 15601813 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-0845 }}</ref>
*Other medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment):
**[[Trazodone]] can be useful against irritability and sleep problems
*Additional treatment options include [[plasmapheresis]] for severe, steroid-unresponsive [[relapse]]s.
A more detailed summary of current treatment options can be found at [http://www.omsusa.org/pranzatelli-medications.htm Treatment Options]

The following medications should probably be avoided:
* [[Midazolam]] - Can cause irritability.
* [[Melatonin]] - Is known to stimulate the immune system.

==Research==
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts and supports research on various movement disorders, including opsoclonus myoclonus. These studies are focused on finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders, as well as increasing knowledge about them.<ref name="NINDS">{{Cite web | last= | first = | title = NINDS Opsoclonus Myoclonus Information Page| publisher = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke| accessdate = October 9, 2011| url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/opsoclonus_myoclonus/opsoclonus_myoclonus.htm}}</ref>
