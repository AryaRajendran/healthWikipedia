A '''pilonidal cyst''', also referred to as a '''pilonidal abscess''', '''pilonidal sinus''' or '''sacrococcygeal fistula''', is a [[cyst]] or [[abscess]] near or on the [[natal cleft]] of the buttocks that often contains hair and skin debris.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Klass | first=Alan | date=November 1, 1956 | title=The So-Called Pilo-Nidal Sinus | journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] | volume=75 | issue=9 | pages=737–742 | pmc=1823328 | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

== Etymology ==

Pilonidal means nest of hair and is derived from the Latin words for hair (''pilus'') and nest (''nidus'').<ref name="Mayoclinic">{{Cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pilonidal-cyst/DS00747 | title=Pilonidal Cyst: Definition | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | date=December 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> The term was first used by [[Herbert Mayo]] in 1833.<ref name="emed">{{Cite web | last=Lanigan | first=Michael | date=September 27, 2012 | url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic771.htm | title=Pilonidal Cyst and Sinus | work=[[Medscape]] | publisher=[[WebMD]] | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref><ref name="ispub">{{Cite journal | last1=Saad | first1=Saad | last2=Shakov | first2=Emil | last3=Sebastian | first3=Vinod | last4=Saad | first4=Adam | year=2007 | title=The use of Wound Vacuum-assisted Closure (V.A.C.™) system in the treatment of Recurrent or Complex Pilonidal Cyst Disease: Experience in 4 Adolescent Patients | journal=The Internet Journal of Surgery | volume=11 | issue=1 | doi=10.5580/382 | issn=1528-8242 | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> R.M.

==Signs and symptoms==

Pilonidal cysts are often very painful, and typically occur between the ages of 15 and 35.<ref name=Mayoclinic/>  Although usually found near the [[coccyx]], the condition can also affect the [[navel]], [[Axilla|armpit]] or [[groin|genital region]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Rao | first1=Amrith | last2=Sharma | first2=Mohit | last3=Thyveetil | first3=Mabel | last4=Karim | first4=Omer | date=December 2006 | title=Penis: An Unusual Site for Pilonidal Sinus | journal=International Urology and Nephrology | volume=38 | issue=3–4 | pages=607–608 | doi=10.1007/s11255-005-4761-5 | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> though these locations are much rarer.

Some people with a pilonidal cyst will be [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="emed2">{{Cite web | last=Doerr | first=Steven | url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/pilonidal_cyst/article_em.htm | title=Pilonidal Cyst | page=1 | work=eMedicineHealth | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

=== Pilonidal sinus ===

A [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] tract, or small channel, may originate from the source of infection and open to the surface of the skin. Material from the cyst may drain through the pilonidal sinus.  A pilonidal cyst is usually painful, but with draining, the patient might not feel pain.

== Causes ==

One proposed cause of pilonidal cysts is [[ingrown hair]].<ref name="title-Pilonidal cyst. Mayo Clinic">{{Cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pilonidal-cyst/DS00747/DSECTION=3 | title=Pilonidal Cyst: Causes | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | date=December 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> Excessive sitting is thought to predispose people to the condition because they increase pressure on the [[coccyx]] region. Trauma is not believed to cause a pilonidal cyst; however, such an event may result in inflammation of an existing cyst. However there are cases where this can occur months after a localized injury to the area. Some researchers have proposed that pilonidal cysts may be the result of a congenital [[Sacral dimple|pilonidal dimple]].<ref name="pmid10950015">{{cite journal |author=da Silva JH |title=Pilonidal cyst: cause and treatment |journal=Dis. Colon Rectum |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=1146–56 |year=2000 |pmid=10950015 |doi=}}</ref> Excessive sweating can also contribute to the cause of a pilonidal cyst. Moisture can fill a stretched hair follicle, which helps create a low-oxygen environment that promotes the growth of [[anaerobic bacteria]], often found in pilonidal cysts. The presence of bacteria and low oxygen levels hamper wound healing and exacerbate a forming pilonidal cyst.<ref name="Bascom">{{cite journal|last=Bascom|first=John|coauthors=Bascom, Thomas|title=Failed Pilonidal Surgery|journal=Archives of Surgery|year=2002|month=October|volume=137|issue=10|pages=1146–50|pmid=12361421}}</ref>   

The condition was widespread in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. More than eighty thousand soldiers having the condition required hospitalization; <ref name="title-Pilonidal disease. DermNet NZ">{{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/acne/pilonidal-sinus.html |title=Pilonidal disease. DermNet NZ |accessdate=2007-11-18 |work=}}</ref> the average length of these wartime hospital stays was 55 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel J.|title=Outpatient Management of Pilonidal Sinuses: Excision and semiprimary closure technic|journal=Military Medicine|year=1978|month=November|volume=143|issue=11|pages=753-757|pmid=101899}}</ref>  The condition was termed "'''jeep seat'''" or "[[Jeep]] riders' disease", because a large portion of people who were being hospitalized for it rode in Jeeps, and prolonged rides in the bumpy vehicles were believed to have caused the condition due to irritation and pressure on the coccyx.

== Treatment ==

[[File:Pilonidal cyst 2 days after surgery.jpg|thumb|300px|Pilonidal cyst two days after surgery.]]

Treatment may include [[antibiotic]] therapy, hot compresses and application of [[depilatory cream]]s.  

In more severe cases, the cyst may need to be [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lanced]] or surgically [[Biopsy|excised]] (along with pilonidal sinus tracts). Post-surgical wound packing may be necessary, and packing typically must be replaced twice daily for 4 to 8 weeks.  In some cases, two years may be required for complete [[granulation tissue|granulation]] to occur.  Sometimes the cyst is resolved via surgical [[marsupialization]].<ref>[http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&issn=1462-8910&volume=1&issue=2&spage=107&epage=110 Prolonged delay in healing after surgical treatment of pilonidal sinus is avoidable]</ref>

Surgeons can also excise the sinus and repair with a reconstructive flap technique, such as a "cleft lift" procedure or Z-plasty, usually done under [[general anesthetic]]. This approach is especially useful for complicated or recurring pilonidal disease, leaves little scar tissue and flattens the region between the buttocks, reducing the risk of recurrence.<ref name="Bascom" />

A novel and less destructive treatment is scraping the tract out and filling it with [[fibrin glue]]. This has the advantage of causing much less pain than traditional surgical treatments and allowing return to normal activities after 1–2 days in most cases.<ref>Fibrin glue in the treatment of pilonidal sinus: results of a [[pilot study]].
Lund JN, Leveson SH.Dis Colon Rectum. 2005 May;48(5):1094-6.</ref>

Pilonidal cysts recur and do so more frequently if the surgical wound is sutured in the midline, as opposed to away from the midline, which obliterates the natal cleft and removes the focus of shearing stress. An incision lateral to the intergluteal cleft is therefore preferred, especially given the poor healing of midline incisions in this region.

== Differential diagnosis ==

A pilonidal cyst can resemble a [[dermoid cyst]], a kind of [[teratoma]] ([[germ cell tumor]]).  In particular, a pilonidal cyst in the [[gluteal cleft]] can resemble a [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]].  Correct diagnosis is important because all [[teratoma]]s require complete surgical excision, if possible without any spillage, and consultation with an [[oncologist]].
