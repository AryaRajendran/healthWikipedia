'''Prediabetes''' is the state in which some but not all of the diagnostic criteria for [[diabetes]] are met.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000086054|prediabetes}}</ref> It is often described as the “gray area” between normal blood sugar and diabetic levels. 

==Classification==
===Impaired fasting glycaemia===
{{main|Impaired fasting glycaemia}}
Impaired fasting glycaemia or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) refers to a condition in which the fasting blood glucose is elevated above what is considered normal levels but is not high enough to be classified as [[diabetes mellitus]]. It is considered a pre-diabetic state, associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology, although of lesser risk than [[impaired glucose tolerance]] (IGT). IFG sometimes progresses to [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]]. There is a 50% risk over 10 years of progressing to overt diabetes. A recent study cited the average time for progression as less than three years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nichols GA, Hillier TA, Brown JB| title=Progression From Newly Acquired Impaired Fasting Glusose to Type 2 Diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=30 |pages=228–233 |year=2007 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/2/228| doi=10.2337/dc06-1392| pmid=17259486 | issue=2}}</ref>  IFG is also a risk factor for mortality.<ref name="pmid17576864">{{cite journal |author=Barr EL, Zimmet PZ, Welborn TA, ''et al.'' |title=Risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance: the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab) |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=151–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17576864 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685628}}</ref>

Fasting blood glucose levels are in a continuum within a given population, with higher fasting glucose levels corresponding to a higher risk for complications caused by the high glucose levels. Impaired fasting glucose is defined as a fasting glucose that is higher than the upper limit of normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus. Some patients with impaired fasting glucose can also be diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance, but many have normal responses to a glucose tolerance test.

[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) criteria for impaired fasting glucose differs from the (American Diabetes Association) ADA criteria, because the normal range of glucose is defined differently. Fasting glucose levels 100&nbsp;mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) and higher have been shown to increase complication rates significantly. However, WHO opted to keep its upper limit of normal at under 110&nbsp;mg/dL for fear of causing too many people to be diagnosed as having impaired fasting glucose, whereas the ADA lowered the upper limit of normal to a fasting glucose under 100&nbsp;mg/dL.

* WHO criteria: [[fasting]] plasma [[glucose]] level from 6.1&nbsp;mmol/l (110&nbsp;mg/dL) to 6.9&nbsp;mmol/L (125&nbsp;mg/dL).<ref name="who-99">.{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/diabetes/publications/en/ |author=[[World Health Organization]] | title= Definition, diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications: Report of a WHO Consultation.

* ADA criteria: fasting plasma glucose level from 5.6&nbsp;mmol/L (100&nbsp;mg/dL) to 6.9&nbsp;mmol/L (125&nbsp;mg/dL).

===Impaired glucose tolerance===
{{Main|Impaired glucose tolerance}}
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a pre-[[diabetic]] state of dysglycemia, that is associated with [[insulin resistance]] and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology. IGT may precede [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]] by many years.  IGT is also a risk factor for mortality.<ref name="pmid17576864"/>

== Signs and symptoms ==

Prediabetes typically has no distinct [[sign (medical)|sign]]s or [[symptom]]s. Patients should monitor for signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These include the following:<ref>Mayo Clinic Diabetes: "Prediabetes". [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prediabetes/DS00624/DSECTION=2]. Accessed Jan. 27, 2009.</ref>

*Constant [[hunger]]
*Unexplained [[weight loss]]
*[[Weight gain]]
*[[Flu-like symptoms]], including [[weakness (medical)|weakness]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]
*[[Blurred vision]]
*Slow [[healing]] of [[Wound|cuts]] or [[bruise]]s 
*[[Tingling]] or loss of feeling in hands or feet 
*Recurring gum or skin [[infection]]s 
*Recurring vaginal or bladder infections

== Cause ==
* Sleep disorders
* Family history of diabetes
* Impaired glucose levels and/or metabolic syndrome
* Cardiovascular disease
* [[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure)
* Increased [[triglycerides]] levels
* Low levels of good cholesterol ([[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]])
* Overweight or obese
* Women who have had [[gestational diabetes]], had high birth weight babies (greater than 9&nbsp;lbs.), and/or has [[Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome]] (PCOS)<ref name="YH">''Power of Prevention,'' American College of Endocrinology. Vol. 1, issue 2, May 2009. http://www.powerofprevention.com/</ref>

These are associated with [[insulin resistance]] and are risk factors for the development of [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]]. Those in this stratum (IGT or IFG) are at increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Of the two, impaired glucose tolerance better predicts cardiovascular disease and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref>"The Prevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes," ADA, ''Diabetes Care'', 25: 742-749, 2002.</ref><ref name="National Diabetes Fact Sheet">[http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/pdf/ndfs_2003.pdf National Diabetes Fact Sheet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Tominaga  ''et al.'' | year = 1999 | month = Jun | title = Impaired glucose tolerance is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but not impaired fasting glucose. The Funagata Diabetes Study | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 22 | issue = 6| pages = 920–4 }}</ref>

In a way, prediabetes is a misnomer since it is an early stage of diabetes. It is now known that the health complications associated with type 2 diabetes often occur before the medical diagnosis of diabetes is made.<ref>[http://diabetes.webmd.com/guide/pre-diabetes WebMD: Prediabetes]. Accessed Jan. 27, 2009.</ref>

=== Genetics ===
As the [[human genome]] is further explored, it is likely that multiple [[Genetics|genetic]] anomalies at different [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] will be found that confer varying degrees of [[predisposition]] to type 2 diabetes.<ref>UpToDate: Classification of diabetes mellitis and genetic diabetic syndromes, Nov 14, 2007</ref> Type 2 DM, which is the condition for which prediabetes is a precursor, has 90-100% [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] in [[twins]]; there is no [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] association.<ref name="ReferenceA">Cotran, Kumar, Collins; '''Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease,''' Saunders Sixth Edition, 1999; 913-926.</ref> However, genetics play a relatively small role in the widespread occurrence of type 2 diabetes. This can be logically deduced from the huge increase in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes which has correlated with the significant change in western lifestyle.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

== Pathophysiology ==

[[Diabetes mellitus]] (DM) is a group of [[metabolic]] [[disease]]s that are characterized by [[hyperglycemia]] and defects in [[insulin]] production in the [[pancreas]] and/or impaired tolerance to insulin effects. DM is a leading cause of [[Disability|morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]]. Because the disease can be [[wikt:insidious|insidious]], the [[diagnosis]] is often delayed. Effects of the disease can be [[Macrovascular disease|macrovascular]], as seen in the cardiovascular system/arthrosclerosis, or [[Microvascular disease|microvascular]], as seen with [[retinopathy]], [[nephropathy]], and [[neuropathy]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Normal glucose [[homeostasis]] is controlled by three interrelated processes. There is [[gluconeogenesis]] (glucose production that occurs in the liver), uptake and utilization of glucose by the peripheral tissues of the body, and insulin secretion by the pancreatic [[islet cell]]s. What triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas is the presence of glucose in the body. The main function of insulin is to increase the rate of transport of glucose into certain cells of the body, such as [[Skeletal muscle|striated muscles]], [[fibroblast]]s, and [[fat cell]]s. It is also necessary for transport of [[amino acid]]s, [[glycogen]] formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, [[triglyceride]] formation from glucose, [[nucleic acid]] synthesis, and [[protein]] synthesis.

Insulin enters cells by first binding to target insulin receptors. DM and some of those with prediabetes have impaired glucose tolerance—in these individuals, blood glucose rises to abnormally high levels. This may be from a lack of pancreatic hormone release or failure of target tissues to respond to the insulin present or both.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Prevention==

The American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) have developed ''lifestyle intervention'' guidelines for preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes:
* Healthy meals (low-fat, low-sugar, low-salt diet)
* Physical exercise (45 minutes of exercise per day, five days a week)
* Reducing weight by as little as 5-10 percent can have a significant impact on overall health.

== Screening ==

Fasting plasma glucose screening should begin at age 30-45 and be repeated at least every three years. Earlier and more frequent screening should be conducted in at-risk individuals. The risk factors for which are listed below:

* [[Family history (medicine)|Family history]] (parent or sibling)
* [[Dyslipidemia]] (triglycerides > 200 or [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] < 35)
* [[Overweight]] or obesity ([[body mass index]] > 25)
* History of [[gestational diabetes]] or infant born with [[birth weight]] greater than {{convert|9|lb|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}
* High risk [[ethnic group]]
* [[Hypertension]] ([[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[blood pressure]] >140&nbsp;[[mmHg]] or [[diastolic]] blood pressure > 90&nbsp;mmHg)
* Prior fasting blood glucose > 99
* Known vascular disease
* Markers of insulin resistance ([[PCOS]], [[acanthosis nigricans]])<ref>"ADA: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes", ''Diabetes Care'' 27: Supp 1.515, 2004.</ref><ref>"Diabetes Guidelines Taskforce: AACE Guidelines for the Management of DM", ''Endocrin Pract'' 1995, 1.149</ref>

== Diagnosis ==

Prediabetes is usually diagnosed with a [[blood test]]:
*Fasting [[blood sugar]] (glucose) level of:
** 110 to 125&nbsp;mg/dL (6.1 mM to 6.9 mM) - WHO criteria
** 100 to 125&nbsp;mg/dL (5.6 mM to 6.9 mM) - ADA criteria
*Two hour [[glucose tolerance test]] after ingesting the standardized 75 Gm glucose solution the blood sugar level of 140 to 199&nbsp;mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mM).<ref name=PSJ>Jellinger, Paul S. "What You Need to Know about Prediabetes." ''Power of Prevention,'' American College of Endocrinology. Vol. 1, issue 2, May 2009. http://www.powerofprevention.com/</ref>
*[[Glycated hemoglobin]] between 5.7 and 6.4 percent <ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_93511.html New Guidelines Urge A1C Test for Diabetes Diagnosis]. [[HealthDay]]. December 29, 2009.</ref>

Levels above these limits would be a diagnosis for [[diabetes]].

== Management ==

Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, can substantially improve glucose tolerance and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)<ref>http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/preventionprogram/</ref> study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a [[low-fat diet]] and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. The [[American Diabetes Association|ADA]] guidelines<ref>https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-prevention/how-to-prevent-diabetes.jsp</ref> recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and [[smoking]] cessation.

For patients with severe risk factors, prescription medication may be appropriate.
This can be considered in patients for whom lifestyle therapy has failed or is not sustainable and who are at high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes.<ref name="utdol.com">UptoDate: Prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus; www.utdol.com/utd/content/topic.do?topicKey=diabetes.</ref> [[Metformin]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lilly M, Godwin M | year = 2009 | month = Apr | title = Treating prediabetes with metformin: systematic review and meta-analysis | url = | journal = Canadian Family Physician | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 363–9 }}</ref> and [[acarbose]] help prevent the development of frank diabetes, and also have a good safety profile. Evidence also supports thiazolidinediones but there are safety concerns, and data on newer agents such as [[GLP-1 receptor agonist]]s, [[DPP4 inhibitor]]s or [[meglitinide]]s are lacking.<ref name=ACE-guideline>{{cite web |url=http://www.aace.com/meetings/consensus/hyperglycemia/hyperglycemia.pdf |title=American College of Endocrinology Consensus Statement on the diagnosis and management of pre-diabetes in the continuum of hyperglycemia—When do the risks of diabetes begin? |format=PDF |work=American College of Endocrinology Task Force on Pre-Diabetes |accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==

The progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus is not inevitable for those with prediabetes. The progression into diabetes mellitus from prediabetes is approximately 25% over three to five years <ref>{{cite journal | author = Nathan  ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | month = Mar | title = Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance: implications for care | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 753–9 }}</ref> 

== Epidemiology ==

Studies conducted from 1988-1994 indicated that at that time, of the US population 40–74 years of age, 33.8% had IFG, 15.4% had IGT, and 40.1% had prediabetes (IFG, IGT, or both). Eighteen million people (6.3% of the population) had type 2 diabetes in 2002.<ref>CDC: Diabetes. National Diabetes Fact Sheet; United States, 2003.</ref>
