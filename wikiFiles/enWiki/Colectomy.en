'''Colectomy''' consists of the [[surgery|surgical]] [[segmental resection|resection]] of any extent of the large intestine ([[colon (anatomy)|colon]]).

==Indications==
Some of the most common indications for colectomy are:

* [[Colon cancer]].
* [[Diverticulitis]] and [[diverticular disease]] of the large intestine.
* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]].
* [[Inflammatory bowel disease]] such as [[ulcerative colitis]] or [[Crohn's disease]].
* Prophylactic colectomy can be indicated in some forms of [[polyposis]], [[Lynch syndrome]] and certain cases of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] because of high risk for development of colorectal cancer.
* [[Bowel infarction]]
* [[Typhlitis]]

==Basic principles==
Traditionally, colectomy is performed via an abdominal incision ([[laparotomy]]), though minimally invasive colectomy, by means of [[laparoscopy]], is growing both in scope of indications and popularity, and is a well-established procedure {{As of|2006|lc=on}} in many medical centers. Recent experience has shown the feasibility of [[single port access colectomy]],<ref name="SPA Colectomy HUG, Geneva">{{cite journal |author=Bucher P, Pugin P, Ph Morel|title=Single port access laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. |journal=Int J Colorectal Dis |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=1013–6 |year=2008|pmid=18607608 |doi=10.1007/s00384-008-0519-8|url=}}</ref> 

Resection of any part of the colon entails mobilization and ligation of the corresponding blood vessels. [[Lymphadenectomy]] is usually performed through excision of the fatty tissue adjacent to these vessels (''mesocolon''), in operations for [[colon cancer]]. 

When the resection is complete, the surgeon has the option of immediately restoring the bowel, by stitching or stapling together both the cut ends (primary [[anastomosis]]), or creating a [[colostomy]]. Several factors are taken into account, including:

* Circumstances of the operation (elective vs emergency);
* Disease being treated;
* Acute physiological state of the patient;
* Impact of living with a colostomy, albeit temporarily;
* Use of a specific preoperative regimen of [[low residue diet]] and [[laxative]]s (so-called "bowel prep").

An [[anastomosis]] carries the risk of [[Wound dehiscence|dehiscence]] (breakdown of the stitches), which can lead to contamination of the [[peritoneal cavity]], [[peritonitis]], [[sepsis]] and [[death]]. [[Colostomy]] is always safer, but places a societal, psychological and physical burden on the patient. The choice is by no means an easy one and is rife with controversy, being a frequent topic of heated debate among [[general surgery|surgeon]]s all over the world.

==Types==

* '''Right hemicolectomy''' and '''left hemicolectomy''' refer to the resection of the [[ascending colon]] (right) and the [[descending colon]] (left), respectively. When part of the [[transverse colon]] is also resected, it may be referred to as an '''extended hemicolectomy'''
* '''Transverse colectomy''' is also possible, though uncommon.
* '''Sigmoidectomy''' is a resection of the sigmoid colon, sometimes including part or all of the rectum ('''proctosigmoidectomy'''). When a sigmoidectomy is followed by terminal [[colostomy]] and closure of the rectal stump, it is called a '''[[Hartmann operation]]'''; this is usually done out of impossibility to perform a "double-barrel" or Mikulicz [[colostomy]], which is preferred because it makes "takedown" (reoperation to restore normal intestinal continuity by means of an [[Anastomosis#Surgical_anastomoses|anastomosis]]) considerably easier.
* When the entire colon is removed, this is called a '''total colectomy''', also known as ''Lane's Operation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/709.html|title=Lane's operation|last=Enersen|first=Ole Daniel|work=whonamedit.com|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> If the rectum is also removed, it is a '''total proctocolectomy'''.
* '''Subtotal colectomy''' is resection of part of the colon or a resection of all of the colon without complete resection of the rectum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oakley JR, Lavery IC, Fazio VW, Jagelman DG, Weakley FL, Easley K |title=The fate of the rectal stump after subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis |journal=Dis.

==History==
[[Sir William Arbuthnot-Lane, 1st Baronet|Sir William Arbuthnot-Lane]] was one of the early proponents of the usefulness of total colectomies, although his overuse of the procedure called the wisdom of the surgery into question.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Edward C.|title=Modern medical mistakes|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1978|page=18|isbn=0-253-15425-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ub1rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Colectomy%2Btonsils%2Bmistake&q=Colectomy#search_anchor}}</ref>
