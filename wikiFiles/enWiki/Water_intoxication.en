'''Water intoxication''', also known as '''water poisoning''' or '''dilutional [[hyponatremia]]''', is a potentially fatal disturbance in [[brain]] functions that results when the normal balance of [[electrolyte]]s in the body is pushed outside safe limits by over-hydration. 

Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water drinking contests in which individuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or long bouts of intensive exercise during which electrolytes are not properly replenished, yet huge amounts of fluid are still consumed.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11732457?dopt=Abstract A study] refers to a renal excretion capacity of 3 ml/hr</ref> Moreover, [[water cure (torture)|water cure]], a method of torture in which the victim is forced to consume excessive amounts of water, can cause water intoxication.

Water, just like any other substance, can be considered a [[poison]] when over-consumed in a specific period of time. Water intoxication mostly occurs when water is being consumed in a high quantity without giving the body the proper nutrients it needs to be healthy.<ref>http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html</ref>

Excess of [[body water]] may also be a result of a medical condition or improper treatment; see "[[hyponatremia]]" for some examples. Water is considered the least toxic chemical compound, with a [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] of 90 g/kg or more in rats.<ref>[http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927321] - see to Section 11: Toxicological Information for the LD<sub>50</sub> verification</ref>

==Physiology== 
At the onset of this condition, fluid outside the cells has an excessively low amount of solutes (such as [[sodium]] ([[hyponatremia]]) and other [[electrolytes]]) in comparison to that inside the cells causing the fluid to shift through (via [[osmosis]]) into the cells to balance its concentration. This causes the cells to swell. In the brain, this swelling increases [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP). It is this increase in pressure which leads to the first observable symptoms of water intoxication: headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness. These are sometimes followed by difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information. As the condition persists papillary and vital signs may result including [[bradycardia]] and widened [[pulse pressure]]. The cells in the brain may swell to the point where blood flow is interrupted resulting in [[cerebral edema]]. Swollen brain cells may also apply [[Brain herniation|pressure to the brain]] stem causing central nervous system dysfunction. Both cerebral edema and interference with the central nervous system are dangerous and could result in seizures, brain damage, coma or death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fluids and electrolytes made incredibly easy! 4th edition|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|editor=David Moreau}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
===Low body mass (infants)===
It can be very easy for children under one year old to absorb too much water, especially if the child is under nine months old. Because of their small body mass, it is easy to take in a large amount of water relative to body mass and total body sodium stores.<ref>[http://www.stlouischildrens.org/content/healthinfo/WaterIntoxicationinInfants.htm Water Intoxication in Infants]</ref>

===Endurance sports===
[[Marathon]] [[running|runners]] are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink too much while running.  This is caused when sodium levels drop below 135&nbsp;mmol/L when athletes consume large amounts of fluid. This has been noted to be the result of the encouragement of excessive fluid replacement by various guidelines. This has largely been identified in marathon runners as a dilutional [[hyponatremia]].<ref>[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa043901?ck=nck& Hyponatremia among Runners in the Boston Marathon] - The New England Journal of Medicine</ref> Medical personnel at marathon events are trained to suspect water intoxication immediately when runners collapse or show signs of confusion.

===Overexertion and heat stress===
Any activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance.  People using drugs such as [[MDMA]] (often referred to colloquially as "Ecstasy") may overexert themselves, perspire heavily, and then drink large amounts of water to rehydrate, leading to electrolyte imbalance and water intoxication â€“ this is compounded by MDMA use increasing the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreasing the amount of water lost through urination.<ref>http://books.google.com.au/books?id=qYYOtQU37jcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=leah%20betts&f=false</ref>  Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration.

===Psychiatric conditions===
[[Psychogenic polydipsia]] is the psychiatric condition in which patients feel compelled to drink large quantities of water, thus putting them at risk of water intoxication. This condition can be especially dangerous if the patient also exhibits other psychiatric indications (as is often the case), as the care-takers might misinterpret the hyponatremic symptoms.

===Iatrogenic===
When an unconscious person is being fed intravenously (for example, [[total parenteral nutrition]]) or via a [[nasogastric tube]] the fluids given must be carefully balanced in composition to match fluids and electrolytes lost.  These fluids are typically [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]], and so water is often co-administered.  If the electrolytes are not monitored (even in an ambulatory patient) either [[hypernatremia]] or [[hyponatremia]] may result.<ref>[http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/26/4/148 Treating Hypernatremic Dehydration ]</ref>

Some neurological/psychiatric medications ([[Oxcarbazepine]], among others) have been found to cause [[hyponatremia]] in some patients.<ref>[http://www.modern-psychiatry.com/oxcarbazepine.htm Oxcarbazepine]</ref> Patients with [[diabetes insipidus]] are particularly vulnerable due to rapid fluid processing.<ref>[http://www.diabetesinsipidus.org/whatisdi.htm What Is Diabetes Insipidus?]</ref>

==Prevention==
Water intoxication can be prevented if a person's intake of water does not grossly exceed his or her losses.<ref name=sa>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-drinking-too-much-water-can-kill Strange but True: Drinking Too Much Water Can Kill]</ref> Healthy kidneys are able to excrete approximately 1 litre of fluid water (0.26 gallons) per hour.<ref name=sa/> However, stress (from prolonged physical exertion), as well as disease states, can greatly reduce this amount.<ref name=sa/>

==Treatment==
Mild intoxication may remain asymptomatic and require only fluid restriction.  In more severe cases, treatment consists of:
* [[Diuretic]]s to increase urination, which are most effective for excess blood volume.
* [[Vasopressin receptor antagonist]]s

==Notable cases==

* In 2003, Walter Dean Jennings, a freshman history major at [[SUNY Plattsburgh]], was pledging the [[Psi Epsilon Chi]] "when he was forced to drink urine, stay awake for days and consume vast amounts of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] during a 10-day initiation and [[hazing]] process." According to PressRepublican.com, "On his last night of pledging the unrecognized fraternity, the 18-year-old was forced to drink gallons of water through a funnel, which caused his brain to swell from water intoxication and ultimately resulted in his death." Eleven members of the fraternity were charged with criminally negligent homicide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://pressrepublican.com/homepage/local_story_339013010.html | title=Wrongful-death judgment handed down for 2003 PSU hazing  | date=December 5, 2007 | publisher=The Press Republican(Google cached version) | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

* On January 12, 2007, Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old woman and a mother of three, from [[Rancho Cordova, California|Rancho Cordova]], California, was found dead in her home by her mother, hours after trying to win one of [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] game consoles. [[KDND|KDND 107.9]] "The End" [[radio station]]'s "[[KDND#Hold Your Wee for a Wii controversy|Hold Your Wee for a Wii]]" contest, involved drinking large quantities of water without [[urination|urinating]]. A nurse called the radio station to warn them about the danger in which they were putting people, but the disc jockeys rejected the warnings.  Lucy Davidson, the winner of the contest, was severely sickened while picking up her prize.  Civil charges against the radio station were filed by Jennifer's family,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16614865/ | title=Woman dies after water-drinking contest | date=January 13, 2007 | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | accessdate=May 10, 2007}}</ref> and the family was eventually awarded $16.5 million in the ensuing wrongful death lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/10/jury-awards-16-million-in-radio-prank-that-left-sacramentoarea-woman-dead-.html | title=Jury awards $16 million to family in fatal radio prank  | date=October 29, 2009 | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]] | accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>  The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] launched its own investigation to determine if the station violated the terms of its operating license.
