[[Image:Calcium pyrophosphate.png|thumb|[[Calcium pyrophosphate]]]]
'''Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease''' ('''CPPD'''), (formerly '''Pseudogout''') is a [[rheumatology|rheumatologic]] disorder with varied symptoms arising due to the accumulation of crystals of [[calcium pyrophosphate]] dihydrate in the connective tissues. It is more commonly known by alternative names that specify certain clinical or radiographic findings, although neither is synonymous with CPPD. ''Pseudogout'' refers to the acute symptoms of joint inflammation or [[synovitis]]: red, tender, and swollen joints that may resemble [[gout]]y arthritis (a similar condition in which monosodium [[urate]] crystals are deposited within the joints). ''Chondrocalcinosis'',<ref name="emedicine1">Rothschild, Bruce M {{eMedicine2|radio|125|Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (radiology)}}</ref><ref name="emedicine2"/> on the other hand, refers to the radiographic evidence of calcification in [[hyaline]] and/or [[fibrocartilage]]. ''Pyrophosphate arthropathy'' is a term that may refer to either of the above.<ref name="oxford">{{Cite book| last = Longmore | first = Murray | coauthors = Ian Wilkinson, Tom Turmezei, Chee Kay Cheung | title = Oxford Handbook of Clinicial Medicine | publisher = Oxford | date = 2007 | isbn = 0-19-856837-1 | page = 841 }}</ref> Statistically, the [[knee|knee joint]] is the most commonly affected.<ref name="emedicine1"/>

==General==
CPPD crystal deposition disease is a polyarticular arthritis (i.e., it leads to an inflammation of several joints in the body), although it may begin as monoarticular (i.e., confined to just one joint).<ref name="PMID"/> CPPD crystals tend to form within articular tissues.<ref name="PMID"/> Although, in theory, any joint may be affected, statistics show that the knees, wrists, and hips are the most commonly attributed areas.<ref name="emedicine2"/> In rare cases, pseudogout may affect the spinal canal and cause damage to the spinal cord.<ref>{{Cite journal

The exact cause of CPPD is unknown, although increased breakdown of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (the molecule used as energy currency in all animals), which results in increased pyrophosphate levels in joints, is thought to be one reason why crystals may develop.<ref name="emedicine2"/> There is some recent evidence suggesting that the gene [[ANKH]] is involved in crystal-related inflammatory reactions and inorganic phosphate transport.<ref name="emedicine2"/> Excessive calcium (due to [[hypomagnesemia]]) has a potential relationship with chondrocalcinosis, and magnesium supplementation may reduce or alleviate symptoms.<ref>{{Cite journal

Frequently found among patients with Hemochromatosis,  [[Marie Warder]], the well-known Hemochromatosis activist, although carrying only one gene for Hemochromatosis, is now crippled by this disorder to the extent that she has to use a voice-recognition device in order to carry on her work as a writer.

==Signs and symptoms==
People with this disorder usually first visit the doctor because inflammation is causing pain in one or more joints.<ref name="emedicine2">Rothschild, Bruce M {{eMedicine|article|330936|Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (rheumatology)}}</ref> [[Hyperparathyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[hemochromatosis]], [[hypophosphatemia]], hypomagnesemia and renal [[osteodystrophy]] are often also associated with chondrocalcinosis.<ref name="emedicine2"/> Other diseases associated with chondrocalcinosis are [[Wilson's disease]] and [[osteoarthritis]]. In some cases, traumatic [[arthritis]] can cause chondrocalcinosis.<ref name="emedicine2"/><ref name="PMID">{{Cite journal| author= Wright GD, Doherty M |title= Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition is not always 'wear and tear' or aging | journal= Ann.

In general, the [[white blood cell]] count is raised.<ref name="emedicine2"/> In rare instances, patients may also have signs of [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].<ref name="emedicine2"/>  This condition can also be associated with [[Milwaukee shoulder syndrome]].

==Diagnosis==
Radiography has a large role to play in the diagnosis of chondrocalcinosis, with [[Radiography|radiographs]], [[Computed Tomography|CT scans]], [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRIs]], [[ultrasound]], and [[nuclear medicine]] all having a part.<ref name="emedicine1"/> CT scans and MRIs show calcific masses (usually within the [[ligamentum flavum]] or joint capsule), however radiography is more successful.<ref name="emedicine1"/>
As with most conditions, chondrocalcinosis can present with similarity to other diseases such as [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and [[gout]].<ref name="emedicine1"/><ref name="emedicine2"/>

[[Arthrocentesis]], or removing synovial fluid from the affected joint, is performed to test the synovial fluid for the calcium pyrophosphate crystals that are present in CPPD. When stained with [[hematoxylin and eosin]], calcium pyrophosphate crystals appears deeply blue ("[[basophilic]]").<ref name=derm_atlas>{{cite web|last=Hosler|first=Greg|title=calcinosis_cutis_2_060122|work=Derm Atlas |url=http://dermatlas.med.jhmi.edu/derm/IndexDisplay.cfm?ImageID=-512163574 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Deposition Disease: Synovial Biopsy, Wrist|url=http://images.rheumatology.org/viewphoto.php?imageId=2862283&albumId=75676|work=Rheumatology Image Bank|publisher=American College of Rheumatology|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> However, CPP crystals are much better known for their [[rhomboid]] shape and weak positive birefringence on polarized light microscopy, and this method remains the most reliable method of identifying the crystals under the microscope.<ref name=dieppe>{{cite journal|last=Dieppe |first=P.  |coauthors=Swan, A. |title=Identification of crystals in synovial fluid|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=1 May 1999 |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=261–3 |doi=10.1136/ard.58.5.261 |url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/58/5/261.full|pmid=10225806|pmc=1752883}}</ref> However, even this method suffers from poor sensitivity, specificity, and inter-operator agreement.<ref name=dieppe />

==Treatment==
Because any medication that could reduce the inflammation of chondrocalcinosis bears a risk of causing organ damage, treatment is not advised if the condition is not causing pain.<ref name="emedicine2"/>
For [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] pseudogout, intra-articular corticosteroid injection, systemic corticosteroids, [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), or, on occasion, high-dose [[colchicine]].<ref name="emedicine2"/> In general, NSAIDs are administered in low doses to help prevent chondrocalcinosis. However, if an acute attack is already occurring, higher doses are administered.<ref name="emedicine2"/> If nothing else works, hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate may provide relief.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Emkey GR and Reginato AM |title=All about gout and pseudogout |journal=Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |volume=26 |issue=10 |year=2009 |url=http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/display/article/1145622/1476306}}</ref>
Research into surgical removal of calcifications is underway, however this still remains an experimental procedure.<ref name="emedicine2"/>

==Epidemiology==
CPPD affects people of all cultures and ethnic origins, and, in the United States, around 50% of the population over 85 years of age are affected.<ref name="emedicine2"/> It may cause considerable pain, but it is never fatal.<ref name="emedicine2"/> Women are at a slightly higher risk than men, with an estimated ratio of occurrence of 1.4:1.<ref name="emedicine2"/>
