The '''B-cell lymphomas''' are types of [[lymphoma]] affecting [[B cells]].  Lymphomas are [[hematological malignancy|"blood cancers"]] in the [[lymph glands]]. They develop more frequently in older adults and in immunocompromised individuals (such as those with [[AIDS]]).

B-cell lymphomas include both [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]s and most [[non-Hodgkins lymphomas]].  They are often divided into indolent (slow-growing) lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas. Indolent lymphomas respond rapidly to treatment and are kept under control (in remission) with long-term survival of many years, but are not cured. Aggressive lymphomas usually require intensive treatments, but have good prospects for a permanent [[cure]].<ref name="mmhe">[http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec14/ch177/ch177c.html Merck Manual home edition], Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas</ref>

Prognosis and treatment depends on the specific type of lymphoma as well as the stage and grade. Treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy. Early-stage indolent B-cell lymphomas can often be treated with radiation alone, with long-term non-reoccurrence.  Early-stage aggressive disease is treated with chemotherapy and often radiation, with a 70-90% cure rate.<ref name="mmhe"/>  Late-stage indolent lymphomas are sometimes left untreated and monitored until they progress. Late-stage aggressive disease is treated with chemotherapy, with cure rates of over 70%.<ref name="mmhe"/>

==Types==

There are fourteen kinds of lymphomas involving B cells.

===Common===
Five account for nearly three out of four patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma:<ref name="The Lymphomas">{{cite web |url=http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1161891669.pdf |title=The Lymphomas |accessdate=2008-04-07 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society |page=12}}</ref>

* [[Primary effusion lymphoma]]
* [[Lymphomatoid granulomatosis]]

===Other===
Additionally, some researchers separate out lymphomas that appear result from other immune system disorders, such as [[AIDS-related lymphoma]].

Classic [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma]] are now considered forms of B-cell lymphoma.<ref name="urlHMDS: Hodgkins Lymphoma">{{cite web |url=http://www.hmds.org.uk/hl.html |title=HMDS: Hodgkin's Lymphoma |work= |accessdate=2009-02-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090304001837/http://www.hmds.org.uk/hl.html| archivedate= 4 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Associated chromosomal translocations==
[[Chromosomal translocation]]s involving the [[immunoglobulin heavy locus]] (IGH@) is a classic cytogenetic abnormality for many B-cell lymphomas, including [[follicular lymphoma]], [[mantle cell lymphoma]] and [[Burkitt's lymphoma]]. In these cases, the immunoglobulin heavy locus forms a [[fusion protein]] with another protein that has pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic abilities. The enhancer element of the immunoglobulin heavy locus, which normally functions to make B cells produce massive production of antibodies, now induces massive transcription of the fusion protein, resulting in excessive pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic effects on the B cells containing the fusion protein. In [[Burkitt's lymphoma]] and [[mantle cell lymphoma]], the other protein in the fusion is [[c-myc]] (on chromosome 8) and [[cyclin D1]]<ref name=jy>{{cite journal |author=Li JY, Gaillard F, Moreau A, ''et al.'' |title=Detection of translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) in mantle cell lymphoma by fluorescence in situ hybridization |journal=Am.

In [[follicular lymphoma]], the fused protein is 
[[Bcl-2]] (on chromosome 18), which gives the fusion protein anti-apoptotic abilities.
