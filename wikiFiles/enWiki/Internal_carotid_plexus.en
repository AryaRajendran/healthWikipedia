The '''internal carotid plexus''' (carotid plexus) is situated on the lateral side of the [[internal carotid artery]], and in the plexus there occasionally exists a small gangliform swelling, the ''carotid ganglion'', on the under surface of the artery. 

Postganglionic sympathetic fibres ascend from the superior cervical ganglion, along the walls of the internal carotid artery, to enter the internal carotid plexus. These fibres then distribute to deep structures, which include the Superior Tarsal Muscle and pupillary dilator muscles.<ref>Hal Blumenfeld, "Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases", Sinauer Associates, 2002, p543</ref> Some of the fibres from the internal carotid plexus converge to form the deep petrosal nerve.<ref>Richard L. Drake, Wayne Vogel & Adam W M Mitchell, "Gray's Anatomy for Students", Elsevier inc., 2005</ref>

The internal carotid plexus communicates with the [[trigeminal ganglion]], the [[abducent nerve]], and the [[pterygopalatine ganglion]] (also named sphenopalatine); it distributes filaments to the wall of the [[carotid artery]], and also communicates with the [[tympanic branch]] of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]].
