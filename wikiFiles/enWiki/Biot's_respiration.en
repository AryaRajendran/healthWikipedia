[[File:Breathing_abnormalities.svg|thumb|Graph showing Biot's respiration and other pathological breathing patterns.]]
'''Biot's respiration''', sometimes also called '''ataxic respiration''',{{Fact|date=December 2008}} is an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by groups of quick, shallow inspirations followed by regular or irregular periods of apnea.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000092260|Biot respiration}}</ref>

It generally indicates a poor prognosis. 

It is named for [[Camille Biot]], who characterized it in 1876.<ref>Biot MC. Contribution a l’etude du phenomene respiratoire de Cheyne-Stokes. Lyon Med. 1876;23:517-528, 561-567.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wijdicks EF |title=Biot's breathing |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

==Causes==
Biot's respiration is caused by damage to the [[medulla oblongata]] due to strokes or trauma or by pressure on the medulla due to [[uncal herniation|uncal]] or [[tentorium cerebelli|tentorial]] herniation. 

It can be caused by [[opioid]] use.<ref name="pmid18763421">{{cite journal |author=Farney RJ, Walker JM, Boyle KM, Cloward TV, Shilling KC |title=Adaptive servoventilation (ASV) in patients with sleep disordered breathing associated with chronic opioid medications for non-malignant pain |journal=J Clin Sleep Med |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=311–9 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18763421 |doi= |url= |pmc=2542501}}</ref>

==Related patterns==
It is distinguished from [[Ataxic respirations|ataxic respiration]] by having more regularity and similar-sized inspirations, whereas ataxic respirations are characterized by completely irregular breaths and pauses. As the breathing pattern deteriorates, it merges with [[ataxic respirations]].

In common medical practice, Biot's respiration is often clinically equivalent to [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]], although the two definitions are separated in some academic settings.
