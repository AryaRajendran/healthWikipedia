'''Low birth weight''' (LBW) is defined as a [[birth weight]] of a liveborn infant of less than 2,500 g (5.5 pounds) regardless of gestational age<ref>[http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gp05.htm+p07 P07 - Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight] in [[ICD-10]]</ref>

==Causes==
LBW is either the result of [[preterm birth]] (that is, a low [[gestational age]] at birth, commonly defined as younger than 37 weeks of gestation) or of the infant being [[small for gestational age]] (that is, a slow [[prenatal growth rate]]), or a combination of both. 

In general, risk factors in the mother that may contribute to low birth weight include young ages, multiple pregnancies, previous LBW infants, poor nutrition, heart disease or [[hypertension]], drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and insufficient [[prenatal care]]. Environmental risk factors include smoking, lead exposure, and other types of air pollutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/pregnancy/000142.htm |title=Labor and delivery - Low Birth Weight |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}</ref>

===Preterm birth===
{{See|Preterm birth}}
Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension, decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.<ref name=Simham2007>

}}</ref> From a practical point a number of factors have been identified that are associated with preterm birth, however, an association does not establish causality.

===Being small for gestational age===
{{See|Small for gestational age}}
Being [[small for gestational age]] can be constitutional, that is, without an underlying pathological cause, or it can be secondary to [[intrauterine growth restriction]], which, in turn, can be secondary to many possible factors. For example, babies with [[congenital anomalies]] or [[chromosomal abnormalities]] are often associated with LBW. Problems with the [[placenta]] can prevent it from providing adequate oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Infections during pregnancy that affect the fetus, such as [[rubella]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[syphilis]], may also affect the baby's weight.

===Environmental factors===
While active [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal tobacco smoking]] has well established adverse [[perinatal]] outcomes such as LBW, that mothers who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely to give birth to low-birth weight infants. Review on the effects of passive maternal smoking, also called environmental tobacco exposure (ETS), demonstrated that increased risks of infants with LBW were more likely to be expected in ETS-exposed mothers.<ref>Knopik VS. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and child outcomes: real or spurious effect? Dev Neuropsychol. 2009;34(1):1-36.</ref><ref>Salmasi G, Grady R, Jones J, et al. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analyses. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2010;89(4):423-41.</ref>
Researches have shown that elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women, even those well below 10&nbsp;ug/dL can cause [[miscarriage]], [[premature birth]], and LBW in the offspring. With 10&nbsp;ug/dL as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's “level of concern”, this cut-off value really needs to arise more attentions and implementations in the future.<ref>Cleveland LM, Minter ML, Cobb KA, et al. Lead hazards for pregnant women and children: part 1: immigrants and the poor shoulder most of the burden of lead exposure in this country. Part 1 of a two-part article details how exposure happens, whom it affects, and the harm it can do. Am J Nurs. 2008 Oct;108(10):40-9</ref> 

The combustion products of solid fuel in developing countries can cause many adverse health issues in people. Because a majority of pregnant women in developing countries, where rate of LBW is high, are heavily exposed to indoor air pollution, increased relative risk translates into substantial population attributable risk of 21% of LBW.<ref>Pope DP, Mishra V, Thompson L, et al. Risk of low birth weight and stillbirth associated with indoor air pollution from solid fuel use in developing countries. Epidemiol Rev. 2010 Apr;32(1):70-81</ref>

A correlation between maternal exposure to CO and low birth weight has been reported that the effect on birth weight of increased ambient CO was as large as the effect of the mother smoking a pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy.<ref>Lewtas J. Air pollution combustion emissions: characterization of causative agents and mechanisms associated with cancer, reproductive, and cardiovascular effects. Mutat Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;636(1-3):95-133.</ref>  
It has been revealed that adverse reproductive effects (e.g., risk for LBW) were correlated with maternal exposure to air pollution combustion emissions in Eastern Europe and North America.<ref>Townsend CL, Maynard RL. Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide. Occup Environ Med. 2002 Oct;59(10):708-11</ref>
Mercury is a known toxic heavy metal that can harm fetal growth and health, and there has been evidence showing that exposure to mercury (via consumption of large [[oily fish]]) during pregnancy may be related to higher risks of LBW in the offspring.<ref>Gochfeld M, Burger J. Good fish/bad fish: a composite benefit-risk by dose curve. Neurotoxicology. 2005 Aug;26(4):511-20.</ref> 

It was revealed that, exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with low birth weight. Aircraft noise exposure caused adverse effects on fetal growth leading to low birth weight and preterm infants.<ref>Kawada T. The effect of noise on the health of children. J Nippon Med Sch. 2004 Feb;71(1):5-10.</ref><ref>Matsui T, Matsuno T, Ashimine K, et al. Association between the rates of low birth-weight and/or preterm infants and aircraft noise exposure. Nippon Eiseigaku Zasshi. 2003 Sep;58(3):385-94.</ref>

==Effects==
LBW is closely associated with fetal and [[Perinatal mortality]] and [[Morbidity]], inhibited growth and cognitive development, and chronic diseases later in life. At the population level, the proportion of babies with a LBW is an indicator of a multifaceted public-health problem that includes long-term maternal malnutrition, ill health, hard work and poor health care in pregnancy. On an individual basis, LBW is an important predictor of newborn health and survival and is associated with higher risk of infant and childhood mortality.<ref>Stevens-Simon C, Orleans M. Low-birthweight prevention programs: the enigma of failure. Birth. 1999 Sep;26(3):184-91.</ref>

Low birth weight constitutes as sixty to eighty percent of the [[infant mortality]] rate in developing countries. Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually a direct cause stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of [[prenatal care]], maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environment. <ref name="Andrews">{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=K.M.|coauthors=Brouillette, D.B, and Brouillette, R.T.|title=Mortality, Infant|journal=Elsevier Inc}}</ref> <ref name="Norton">{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=M|title=New evidence on birth spacing: promisng findings for improving newborn, infant, child, and maternal health|journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics|year=2005|volume=89|pages=S1-S6}}</ref>
