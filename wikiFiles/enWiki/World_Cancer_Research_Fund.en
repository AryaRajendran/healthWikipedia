It focuses on [[Scientific method|scientific research]] into the links between cancer and diet, [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and [[Adipose tissue|body fat]].

==Structure==
WCRF International provides support and operational services to its member organisations, which are based in the US ([[American Institute for Cancer Research]]); UK ([[World Cancer Research Fund UK]]); Netherlands (Wereld Kanker Onderzoek Fonds); and Hong Kong (World Cancer Research Fund Hong Kong).

WCRF International together with its member organisations are known as the WCRF global network.<ref>[http://www.wcrf.org/wcrf_around_the_world/wcrf_around_world.htm WCRF International website;]</ref>

==Scientific Work==

'''First Expert Report''': In 1997, the WCRF global network published ''Food, Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective''. This [[expert report]] examined all the available evidence on the links between cancer and diet. According to WCRF International’s website, the report was a “catalyst for change”.<ref>[http://www.wcrf.org/research/expert_report/expert_report.htm WCRF International website;]</ref>

'''Second Expert Report''': In November 2007, the WCRF global network published ''[[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]]'',.<ref>website for ''''Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective''''; [http://www.dietandcancerreport.org]</ref> In the initial review half a million studies were identified, which were screened down to 22,000. Eventually, 7,000 were deemed relevant and met the quality criteria for definitive [[wikt:conclusion|conclusions]] to be drawn. A panel of 21 experts then made 10 recommendations for cancer prevention.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7069914.stm BBC article on the report;]</ref>

'''Policy Report''': In February 2009, the WCRF global network published ''Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention'', a companion document to the ''Second Expert Report''.<ref>[http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/ Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention;]</ref> It included 48 recommendations for changes that different groups in society can make to help prevent cancer. It also included a preventability study that estimated that a third of the most common cancers in the UK could be prevented through diet, physical activity and [[Management of obesity|weight management]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7908675.stm BBC article about Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention;]</ref>

'''Research''': WCRF International manages and administers the International Research Grant Programme<ref>[http://www.wcrf.org/research/grant_programme/grant_programme.htm WCRF International website page about grant programme;]</ref> on behalf of its member organisations in the UK, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. The [[American Institute for Cancer Research]] (AICR) also has its own grant programme.<ref>[http://www.aicr.org/site/PageServer?pagename=res_ga_home AICR website page on grant programme;]</ref> WCRF International and AICR manage the Continuous Update Project, the largest central resource for scientific evidence on diet, physical activity, body weight and cancer.
