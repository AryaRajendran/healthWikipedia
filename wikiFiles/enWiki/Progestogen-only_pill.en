}}'''Progestogen-only pills''' or '''progestin-only pills''' ('''POP''') are [[contraceptive]] pills that contain only synthetic [[progestogen]]s ([[progestin]]s) and do not contain [[estrogen]]. They are colloquially known as '''mini pills'''.

Although such pills are sometimes called "Progesterone-Only Pills", they do not actually contain [[progesterone]], but one of several chemically related compounds; and there are a number of [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen-only pills|progestogen-only contraceptive formulations]].

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.<ref name=glasier>{{cite book|last=[[Anna Glasier|Glasier]]|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J. Larry|editor2-last=De Groot|editor2-first=Leslie J.|title=Endocrinology|edition=6th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|pages=2417–2427|isbn=978-1-4160-5583-9}}</ref>

* Very-low-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as traditional progestogen-only pills (and subdermal implants [[Norplant]] and Jadelle and [[IntraUterine System|intrauterine systems]] Progestasert and Mirena), inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the cervical mucus, thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.
* Intermediate-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Nexplanon]]), allow some follicular development (part of the steps of ovulation) but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very-low-dose progestogens.
* High-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development (see above) and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very-low-dose and intermediate-dose progestogens.

In [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium were also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could, in theory, interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).

==Efficacy and effectiveness ==
The theoretical efficacy is similar to that of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] (COCP). However, this pill is taken continuously without any breaks between packets, and traditional progestogen-only pills must be taken to a much stricter time every day (within 3 hours vs. a COCP's 12 hours). However, in some countries, the POP Cerazette has an approved window of 12 hours.  The effectiveness is, therefore, dependent upon compliance.

POPs are not dependent upon gut bacterial [[flora (microbiology)|flora]] for their absorption and so are not affected by courses of [[antibiotics]]. They will, however, be affected by any episodes of diarrhea or vomiting.

==Benefits==
Lacking the estrogen of combined pills, they are not associated with increased risks of [[DVT]]  or [[heart disease]]. With the decreased clotting risk, they are not contraindicated in the setting of [[sickle-cell disease]]. The progestin-only pill is recommended over regular birth control pills for women who are [[breastfeeding]] because the mini-pill does not affect milk production (estrogen reduces the amount of breast milk). Like combined pills, the minipill decreases the likelihood of [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].

It is unclear whether POPs provide protection against [[ovarian cancer]] to the extent that COCP do.

There are fewer serious complications than on COCP.<ref>Author: Laura Borgelt-Hansen.[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/421497_10 Oral Contraceptives: An Update on Health Benefits and Risks: Progestin-Only Minipill] J Am Pharm Assoc. 2001;41(6) </ref>

==Side-effects==
*With no break in the dosage, menstrual flow does not initially occur at a predictable time. Most women tend to establish, over a few months, light spotting at approximately regular intervals.
*May cause [[mastalgia]] (breast tenderness) and mood swings.
*Weight gain is less commonly experienced than on COCP.
*Some women may experience abdominal cramps and heavy bleeding.

==Breast cancer risk==
Epidemiological evidence on POPs and breast cancer risk is based on much smaller populations of users and so is less conclusive than that for COCPs.

In the largest (1996) reanalysis of previous studies of hormonal contraceptives and breast cancer risk, less than 1% were POP users. Current or recent POP users had a slightly increased relative risk (RR 1.17) of breast cancer diagnosis that just missed being statistically significant. The relative risk was similar to that found for current or recent COCP users (RR 1.16), and, as with COCPs, the increased relative risk decreased over time after stopping, vanished after 10 years, and was consistent with being due to earlier diagnosis or promoting the growth of a preexisting cancer.<ref name=reanalysis>{{cite journal |author=Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer |year=1996 |title=Breast cancer and hormonal contraceptives: collaborative reanalysis of individual data on 53,297 women with breast cancer and 100,239 women without breast cancer from 54 epidemiological studies |journal=Lancet |volume=347 |issue=9017 |pages=1713–27 |pmid=8656904 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)90806-5}}</ref><ref name=further>{{cite journal |author=Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer |year=1996 |title=Breast cancer and hormonal contraceptives: further results |journal=Contraception |volume=54 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1S–106S |pmid=8899264 }}</ref> 

The most recent (1999) [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] evaluation of progestogen-only hormonal contraceptives reviewed the 1996 reanalysis as well as 4 case-control studies of POP users included in the reanalysis. They concluded that: "Overall, there was no evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer".<ref name=iarc72>{{cite book |author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |title=Hormonal contraception and post-menopausal hormonal therapy; IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, Volume 72 |year=1999 |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |isbn=92-832-1272-X |pages=339–397 |chapter=Hormonal contraceptives, progestogens only |chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-2.html}}</ref>
