'''Abortion in India''' has been legal since 1971.

==Legal status==
===Before 1971===

The [[Indian Penal Code]], which was enacted in 1860 and was written in accordance with British law at the time of is creation, declared induced abortion as illegal. Induced abortion was defined as purposely "causing miscarriage",.<ref name="Chandrasekhar">Chandrasekhar, S. ''India's Abortion Experience'' Denton, TX: University of North Texas Press, 1994.</ref> Abortion practitioners would either be incarcerated for up to three years, fined, or both; women undergoing abortions could be imprisoned for up to seven years and also be charged an additional fine.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> The only exception was when abortion was induced in order to save the life of the woman.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>  Despite the fact that this passage in the penal code was changed in Great Britain in 1967, India did not change it until 1971.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>

Countless women died attempting illegal abortions as a result of the penal code, and it was a combination of this and the growing population that made the country reconsider its initial stance.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> In 1964, the Central Family Planning Board of the Government of India met and formed a committee designed to examine the subject of abortion from medical, legal, social, and moral standpoints.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> The Abortion Study Committee, lead by the then Health Minister of the state of Maharashtra Mr. Shantilal Shah, spent the next two years studying the issue, and submitted a report with its suggestions in December 1966.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> This report considered the penal code to be too restrictive and recommended that the law's qualifications should be relaxed; many of these suggestions were included in the subsequent Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>

===1971 and beyond===

As per India’s abortion laws only qualified doctors under stipulated conditions can perform abortion on a woman in an approved clinic or [[hospital]]. The Indian abortion laws fall under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, which was enacted by the Indian Parliament in the year 1971. The MTP Act came into effect from April 1, 1972 and was once amended in 1975. 

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of [[India]] clearly states the conditions under which a pregnancy can be ended or aborted, the persons who are qualified to conduct the abortion and the place of implementation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medindia.net/Indian_Health_Act/the-medical-termination-of-pregnancy-act-1971-introduction.htm|title=Medical Termination of Pregnancy, 1971|publisher=Medindia.com|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> Some of these qualifications are as follows:

* Women whose physical and/or mental health were endangered by the pregnancy<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>
* Women facing the birth of a potentially handicapped or malformed child<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>
* Rape<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>
* Pregnancies in unmarried girls under the age of eighteen with the consent of a guardian<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>
* Pregnancies in "lunatics" with the consent of a guardian<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>
* Pregnancies that result are a result of failure in sterilization<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>

The length of the pregnancy must not exceed twenty weeks in order to qualify for an abortion.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>

At the time the Act was passed, people feared the overcrowding of hospitals and an increase in promiscuity in teenagers, young adults, and young widows.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/> Sex-selective abortions favoring males was also a concern.<ref name="Chandrasekhar"/>

Vs. Anil Kumar Malhotra & Ors. – Civil Revision No. 6337 and 6017 of 2011 – Medical termination of Pregnancy act, 1971 – Section 4 – Medical termination of Pregnancy Rules, 2003 – Rule 5 – Termination of pregnancy – Husband has no right to compel his wife not to get pregnancy terminated – He has no right to sue his wife for compensation – Also has no cause of action against his wife – Strained relations between the husband and wife – Decision of wife to get termination of unwanted foetus was right – Not the act of termination of pregnancy – No express or implied consent of husband is required for getting pregnancy terminated. [Para 20] - Medical termination of Pregnancy act, 1971 – Section 4 – medical termination of Pregnancy rules, 2003 – Rule 5 – Personal right of a woman to give birth to a child – It is not the right of a husband to compel his wife to give birth to a child for the husband – No doubt judicial precedents are there, where the courts have considered the termination of pregnancy by the wife as mental cruelty – Unwanted pregnancy would naturally effect the mental health of the pregnant women – The act of the medical practitioner was perfectly legal and justified – Plaintiff/husband has failed to bring any document on record to show the act of medical practitioner was illegal and unjustified – It is held that no cause of action accrued to the plaintiff/husband to sue his in-laws family – The suit prima facie is vexatious, merit less qua the present petitioner also. [Para 22 & 29].

===Statistics===
According to the Consortium on National Consensus for Medical Abortion in India, every year an average of about 11 million abortions take place annually and around 20,000 women die every year due to abortion related complications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiims.edu/aiims/events/Gynaewebsite/ma_finalsite/introduction.html|title=Introduction|publisher=Consortium on National Consensus for Medical Abortion in India|accessdate=2008-12-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081120105036/http://www.aiims.edu//aiims/events/Gynaewebsite/ma_finalsite/introduction.html| archivedate= 20 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Most abortion-related maternal deaths are attributable to illegal abortions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiims.ac.in/aiims/events/Gynaewebsite/ma_finalsite/report/1_1_1.htm|title=Current status of abortion in India|publisher=Consortium on National Consensus for Medical Abortion in India|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>

==Sex-selective abortion==
Giving or taking prenatal tests, including ultrasound scanning, solely to determine the sex of the fetus was criminalized by Indian law in 1994. In 2002, the penalties were stiffened: up to three years in jail and a [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 10,000 fine for the first offense and five years imprisonment and Rs. 50,000 for the second.

==Indications for early medical abortion==
===General condition to be fulfilled===
Any woman coming to a health facility seeking termination of pregnancy the following aspects have to be assessed and found appropriate:<ref>[http://www.rxbharat.com/women-health/pregnancy/68-pregnancy/68-guidelines-for-medical-abortion-in-india  Guidelines for Medical Abortion in India]</ref>
*frame of the mind of patient and her acceptability of minimum three follow-up visits
*ready for surgical procedure if failure or excessive bleeding occurs
*family support
*permission of guardian in case of minor as per MTP Act 1971
*easy access to appropriate health care facility
Abortion in India can be done till 20 weeks of pregnancy. But an opinion of a second doctor is necessary between weeks 12 and 20. 
Only registered medical practitioners as prescribed by the MTP Act are authorized to prescribe mifepristone with misoprostol for medical abortion (Definition 2(d) of section 2 and MTP rule 3).
Mifepristone with misoprostol for termination of early pregnancy not exceeding seven weeks, may be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner as prescribed under section 2 (d) and rule 3, having access to a place approved by the Government under section 4 (b) and rule (1), for surgical and emergency back-up when such a back-up is indicated.
This may include primary health care-clinic or hospital-based set-up. Initial workup, counseling, prescription and administration could be in a clinic or in the consulting room.
Home administration of misoprostol may be advised at discretion in certain cases with an access to 24-hours emergency services.

===Choice between Medical and Surgical Abortion===
*Vacuum Aspiration (Suction evacuation) is the most commonly used method for termination of early pregnancies. However, being a surgical technique, it is associated with risks of infection, perforation of uterus, incomplete abortion and post-procedure uterine synechiae formation ([[Asherman's Syndrome]]).
*The success of abortion with drugs depends on multiple factors including the regimen used, dosage schedule, route of administration and gestational age.
*Mifepristone with misoprostol is favourable if pregnancy is = 7 weeks.
*Surgical abortion is preferred if patient desires concurrent tubal ligation.
*If a woman fulfills the criteria for selecting either method, final choice to be given to the woman.
