There are three main categories which describe the '''invasiveness of surgical procedures'''.  These are: ''non-invasive procedures'', ''minimally invasive procedures'', and ''invasive procedures'' (the latter of which may also be called ''open surgery'').

==Non-invasive procedure==
A [[medical procedure]] is strictly defined as ''non-invasive'' when no break in the skin is created and there is no contact with the mucosa, or skin break, or internal body cavity beyond a natural or artificial body orifice. For example deep palpation and percussion is non-invasive but a [[rectal examination]] is invasive. Similarly, examination of the ear-drum or inside the nose or a wound dressing change all fall outside the strict definition of ''non-invasive procedure''. There are many non-invasive procedures, ranging from simple observation, to specialised forms of surgery, such as [[radiosurgery]].

For centuries, physicians have employed many simple non-invasive methods based on physical parameters in order to assess body function in health and disease ([[physical examination]] and [[inspection (medicine)|inspection]]), such as [[pulse]]-taking, the [[auscultation]] of [[heart sounds]] and [[breath sounds|lung sounds]] (using the [[stethoscope]]), [[temperature examination]] (using [[thermometer]]s), [[respiratory examination]], [[peripheral vascular examination]], [[oral examination]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}, [[abdominal examination]], external [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] and [[palpation]], [[blood pressure]] measurement (using the [[sphygmomanometer]]), change in body volumes (using [[plethysmograph]]), [[audiometry]], [[eye examination]] and many others.

The discovery of the first modern non-invasive techniques based on physical methods, [[electrocardiography]] and [[X-ray]]s, dates back to the end of the 19th century. Since then, non-invasive methods &ndash; which penetrate the body nonetheless, but by [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] or [[particle radiation]] rather than a [[scalpel]] &ndash; have continuously enlarged the scope of [[medical technology]]. Non-invasive techniques commonly used for [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and therapy include the following:

In some cases, non-invasive methods will not work for the intended purpose, so medical technology has developed minimally-invasive methods, such as hypodermic injection (using the [[syringe]]), [[endoscopy]], [[percutaneous]] surgery,  [[laparoscopic surgery]], [[coronary catheterization]], [[angioplasty]], [[stereotactic surgery]] and many others. The benefits for the patient are self-evident.

==Minimally invasive procedure==
A ''minimally invasive procedure'' (MIP) is any procedure ([[surgery|surgical]] or otherwise) that is less [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] than [[open surgery]] used for the same purpose. A minimally invasive procedure typically involves use of arthoscopic (for joints and the spine) or [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] devices and remote-control manipulation of instruments with indirect observation of the surgical field through an [[endoscopy|endoscope]] or large scale display panel, and is carried out through the [[skin]] or through a [[body cavity]] or anatomical opening. 

By use of a MIP, a patient may require only a band-aid on the incision, rather than multiple stitches or staples to close a large incision. This usually results in less infection, a quicker recovery time and shorter hospital stays, or allow [[outpatient]] treatment.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=mesh&list_uids=68019060 NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information,  NCBI, MeSH, Medical SubHeadings, NLM, National Library of Medicine]</ref> However, the safety and effectiveness of each procedure must be demonstrated with [[randomized controlled trial]]s. The term was coined by John EA Wickham in 1984, who wrote of it in ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1987.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wickham JE' |title=The new surgery |journal=Br Med J | volume=295 |pages=1581–1582 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/295/6613/1581 |date=1987-12-19 |doi=10.1136/bmj.295.6613.1581 }}</ref> A minimally invasive procedure is distinct from a '''non-invasive procedure''', such as external imaging instead of exploratory surgery.  When there is minimal damage of [[biological tissue]]s at the point of entrance of instrument(s), the procedure is called minimally invasive.

===Minimal incision technique===
{{Main|Surgical Incisions}}
The ''minimal incision technique'' is a specialized surgical technique practiced by some [[physician]]s to remove masses or growths with minimal [[scar]]ring and less recovery time.  Most [[surgeon]]s usually cut along 3/4 to the full length of the mass to access it or remove it.  With the minimal incision technique the incision is usually about 1/10 the size of the underlying mass and the surgeon carefully dissects the mass out through this very small incision.  A smaller [[incision]] forms a much smaller scar and results in less recovery time for the patient.  This technique is useful for [[cyst]]s or [[lipoma]]s.  Patients with such [[lesions]] on cosmetically or functionally important areas such as the face can gain great benefit from such techniques.

===Specific procedures===
Many medical procedures are called minimally invasive, such as [[syringe|hypodermic injection]], air-pressure injection, [[subdermal implant]]s, [[Refractive surgery]], [[endoscopy]], [[percutaneous]] surgery, [[laparoscopic surgery]], [[arthroscopic surgery]], [[cryosurgery]], [[microsurgery]], [[keyhole surgery]], [[endovascular surgery]] (such as [[angioplasty]]), [[coronary catheterization]], permanent [[vertebral column|spinal]] and [[brain]] [[electrodes]], [[stereotactic surgery]], [[Nuss procedure|The Nuss Procedure]], [[radioactivity]]-based medical imaging methods, such as [[gamma camera]], [[Positron emission tomography]] and [[SPECT]] (single photon emission tomography). Related procedures are [[image-guided surgery]], [[robotic surgery]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ahmed K, Khan MS, Vats A, ''et al.'' |title=Current status of robotic assisted pelvic surgery and future developments |journal=International Journal of Surgery |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=431–40 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19735746 |doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2009.08.008}}</ref> and [[interventional radiology]].

===Benefits===
Minimally invasive [[surgery]] should have less operative [[Physical trauma|trauma]] for the patient than an equivalent invasive procedure. It may be more or less expensive (for dental implants, a minimally invasive method reduces the cost of installed implants and shortens the implant-prosthetic rehabilitation time with 4–6 months<ref>

</ref>). Operative time is longer, but hospitalization time is shorter. It causes less [[pain]] and [[scar]]ring, speeds recovery, and reduces the incidence of post-surgical complications, such as [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]. Some studies have compared [[heart surgery]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kilger E, Weis FC, Goetz AE, ''et al.'' |title=Intensive care after minimally invasive and conventional coronary surgery: a prospective comparison |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=534–9 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11355122 |doi=10.1007/s001340000788}}</ref> However, minimally invasive surgery is not necessarily minor [[surgery]] that only [[regional anesthesia]] is required. In fact, most of these procedures still require [[general anesthesia]] to be administered beforehand.

===Risks===
Minimally invasive procedures are not completely safe, and some have complications ranging from infection to death. Risks and complications include the following:
*Anesthesia or medication reactions
*Bleeding
*Infection
*Internal organ injury
*Blood vessel injury
*Vein or lung blood clotting
*Breathing problems
*Death<ref>[http://www.mipinfo.com/dtcf/pages/RisksAndComplications.htm “Risks and Complications"]</ref>

All of these risks are present also in open, more invasive surgery.

There may be an increased risk of hypothermia and peritoneal trauma due to increased exposure to cold, dry gases during [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]].  The use of heated and humidified CO<sub>2</sub> may reduce this risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peng Y, Zheng M, Ye Q, Chen X, Yu B, Liu B |title=Heated and humidified CO<sub>2</sub> prevents hypothermia, peritoneal injury, and intra-abdominal adhesions during prolonged laparoscopic insufflations |journal=The Journal of Surgical Research |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=40–7 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18639246 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2008.03.039}}</ref>

===Prevalence===
Due to these advantages, surgeons are attempting to perform more procedures as minimally invasive procedures. Some procedures, such as gall bladder removal, can be done very effectively as minimally invasive surgery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Other procedures, such as [[endarterectomy]], have a higher incidence of strokes in some studies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The first successful minimally invasive [[aortic aneurysm]] surgery was performed by Dr. [[Michael L. Marin]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]].<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/Who%20We%20Are/Newsroom/Press%20Releases?citype=News&ciid=04192006 Mount Sinai Hospital In the News]</ref>

"Lapraroscopic surgery has been around for a long time. We've been using laparoscopy for appendectomies, for taking out gall bladders and for removing cysts on the ovaries. But it's been in very limited use for hysterectomies."<ref>Warren Volker, OB/GYN MD [http://www.volkerhealthcare.com/micro_surgery/ ''Minimally Invasive Procedures'']</ref> Laparoscopic hysterectomy, with incisions measuring less than 10&nbsp;mm, is used for less than 10% of the roughly 800,000 hysterectomies annually performed in the United States, according to the American Association of Gynecological Laparoscopists (AAGL).

===Equipment===
Special [[medical equipment]] may be used, such as [[fiber optic]] cables, miniature [[video camera]]s and special [[surgical instruments]] handled via tubes inserted into the body through small openings in its surface. The images of the interior of the body are transmitted to an external [[video monitor]] and the surgeon has the possibility of making a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], visually identifying internal features and acting surgically on them.

==Open surgery==
Open surgery is characterized by the staples or stitches used to close the incision. Some practitioners of open surgery, as a reaction to minimally invasive techniques, now refer to open surgery as "microscopic surgery". That confusing title is based on the magnifying technology used during open surgery, after the incision is made to permit the surgeon's hands into the patient's body. 

An ''invasive procedure'' is one which penetrates or breaks the [[skin]] or enters a [[body cavity]].  Examples of invasive procedures include those that involve perforation, an incision, a catheterization, or other entry into the body. [[Surgery]] is a typical medical invasive procedure. An ''open surgery'' means cutting skin and tissues so the surgeon has a direct access to the structures or organs involved. The structures and tissues involved can be seen and touched, and they are directly exposed to the air of the operating room.  Examples of open surgery include herniated disk surgery, the removal of organs, such as the gallbladder (though cholecsytectomy is now mostly done laproscopically) or kidney, and most types of [[cardiac surgery]] and [[neurosurgery]]. Open surgery involves large incisions, in which the tissues are exposed to the air.
