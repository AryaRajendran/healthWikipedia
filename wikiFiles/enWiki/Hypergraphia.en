{{Distinguish|Hypergraphy}}
'''Hypergraphia''' is an overwhelming urge to write. It is not itself a disorder, but can be associated with [[temporal lobe]] changes in [[epilepsy]], and [[hypomania]] and [[mania]] in the context of [[bipolar disorder]]. 

==Causes==
Several different regions of the brain govern the act of writing. The physical motion of the hand is controlled by the [[cerebral cortex]] which comprises part of the outer layer of the brain. The drive to write, on the other hand, is controlled by the [[limbic system]], a ring-shaped cluster of cells deeply buried in the cortex which governs emotion, affiliated instincts and inspiration and is said to regulate the human being's need for communication. Words and ideas are cognized and understood by the [[temporal lobes]] behind the ears, and these temporal lobes are connected to the limbic system. Ideas are organized and edited in the frontal lobe of the brain.

Although temporal lobe lesions cause temporal lobe epilepsy, it is also known to run in families. Hypergraphia is understood to be triggered by changes in brainwave activity in the temporal lobe. Hypergraphia has been observed in 8% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.<ref>Schachter, Holmes, Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenité 2008, p. 254.</ref>

It is also associated with [[bipolar disorder]]. Manic and depressive episodes have been reported to intensify hypergraphia symptoms. Additionally [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] and people with [[frontotemporal dementia]] can also experience a compulsive drive to write.

[[neurology|Neurologist]] [[Alice Weaver Flaherty]], in her book ''The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer's Block, and the Creative Brain,''  describes its relationship to [[writer's block]] and to compulsive reading or [[hyperlexia]].

==Famous cases==

Hypergraphia was one of the central issues in the 1999 trial of Alvin Ridley for the imprisonment and murder of his wife [[Virginia Ridley]].<ref name="Brownlee">Brownlee 2006.</ref> The mysterious woman, who had died in bed of apparent suffocation, had remained secluded in her home for twenty-seven years in the small town of [[Ringgold, Georgia]], USA. Her ten thousand page journal, which provided abundant evidence that she suffered from [[epilepsy]] and had remained housebound of her own will, was instrumental in the acquittal of her husband.<ref name="Brownlee" />

Both [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] are reported to have been affected by hypergraphia.<ref>[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/01.29/01-creativity.html The brains behind writer's block]</ref>

[[Lewis Carroll]], the author of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', is said to have had hypergraphia.<ref name="Flaherty">Flaherty, ''The Midnight Disease'' p 26</ref> In his lifetime he wrote over 98,000 letters varying in format. The letters were written backwards, in [[rebus]], and in different patterns, such as the "Mouse Tail" in the former book.
Some examples of his letters can be found [http://www.philobiblon.com/isitabook/games/index.html here].

The Reverend [[Robert Shields (diarist)|Robert Shields]] maintained a diary chronicling every 5 minutes of his life from 1972 until a stroke disabled him in 1997. The diary fills 81 boxes and contains approximately 37.5 million words. This gargantuan work details every minutae of Shields' life, including extensive details of his bowel movements, blood pressure, body temperature, and various medications, as well as extensive lists of the groceries he bought and their prices. Many entries consist of "I was at the keyboard of the [[IBM Wheelwriter]], making entries for the diary."<ref>Pickover 1999, p. 300.</ref>

Outsider artist and writer [[Henry Darger]] would appear to have been a case of hypergraphia, having produced what has been described as the longest novel in existence, ''The Story of the Vivian Girls''.

American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] is acknowledged as one of the most prolific of the 20th century and may have been affected by hypergraphia. He carried paper and pen wherever he went and is known to have composed almost every day, in shopping malls, restaurants, and even on buses. He claimed to have thrown over 1,000 of his early compositions into the fireplace in the 1940s while still a young man, and even at the time of his death, in 2000, had penned around 500 more, most of which are published.

Former United States Senator [[Bob Graham]] has maintained a meticulous account of the daily events of his life. Between 1977 and 2003, Graham filled almost 4,000 notebooks,<ref name="sptimes">[http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/23/Floridian/Dress_in_gray_suit__d.shtml Dress in gray suit, discuss CIA, mingle]</ref> recording such varied items as the movie he and his daughter rented on the eve of his grandchild's birth (''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', which, he noted, he rewound and returned), as well as details of strangers he'd met at airports so that he could follow up with a friendly letter. Each notebook, color-coded by season, covered two to three days. His daily entries included minutiae like his weight, clothes into which he changed, what he ate and where, as well as serious matters of state. When the company that manufactured Graham's notebooks ceased production, Graham bought up hundreds of the remaining stock. During the 2000 Presidential race, Vice President [[Al Gore]] considered Graham as a potential running mate, but campaign insiders worried Graham's habit of filling notebooks with daily minutia would be perceived by the public as eccentric.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1DE1F3CF93BA3575BC0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE SELECTION; In Selecting a No. 2, No Detail Too Small]</ref> Finally, late in the selection process, Gore decided against Graham.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/democrats2004/graham.html NPR Political Editor Ken Rudin provides background on the Graham candidacy.]</ref> Nevertheless, Graham maintained his notebooks were not diaries—as they contained no introspective commentary—but rather an efficient system for life management.<ref name="sptimes" />  "I would rather have more detail than less," Graham told ''Time'' magazine in 2000. "I use [the notebooks] as a working tool. I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do. I would be reticent to be too open in describing personal feelings and emotions."<ref name="Takenote">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,49456,00.html Take Note of Bob Graham]</ref> In the same article, an anonymous source close to Graham suspected the suicide of Graham's half-brother spurred Graham to seek control and discipline, one form of which was Graham's notebooks.<ref name="Takenote" />

[[Arthur Crew Inman]] (1895 - 1963) was a reclusive and unsuccessful American poet whose 17-million word diary, extending from 1919 to 1963, is one of the longest English language diaries on record. The diary was edited by Daniel Aaron and published in 1985.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Inman | first1 = Arthur Crew | authorlink1 = Arthur Crew Inman | last2 = Aaron | first2 = Daniel | authorlink2 = Daniel Aaron | title = The Inman Diary: A Public and Private Confession | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1985 | location = Cambridge, MA | accessdate = 2012-04-27 | isbn = 978-0-674-45445-3}}</ref>

[[Warren Steed Jeffs]], president and "prophet" of the [[FLDS]] polygamous sect, who was convicted in 2011 of aggravated sexual assault of a child, recorded every detailed aspect of his daily life in voluminous typed manuscript he referred to as "Priesthood Records."<ref>{{cite web|title=With God on Their Side|url=http://m.texasmonthly.com/id/14328/Religion/#part4|publisher=Texas Monthly|author=Vine, Katy|date=October 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incriminating Documents|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/2011-10-01/webextra8.php|publisher=Texas Monthly|author=Vine, Katy|date=October 2011|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref>  Experts described Jeffs' writings as having recorded Jeffs' "every thought."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fall of a Prophet: Records doom rather than bless|publisher=San Angelo Standard Times|url=http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2011/aug/20/records-doom-rather-than-bless/|author=Waller, Matthew|date=August 20, 2011|accessdate=June 8, 2012|(" Warren Jeffs left no part of his life as "prophet" unrecorded when he assumed absolute leadership of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints")}}</ref> Jeffs' detailed diaries were seized by law enforcement agencies in a 2008 raid of Jeffs' Texas compound.
