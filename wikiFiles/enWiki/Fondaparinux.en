'''Fondaparinux''' (trade name '''Arixtra''') is an [[anticoagulant]] medication chemically related to [[low molecular weight heparin]]s. It is marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. A generic version developed by Alchemia is marketed within the US by [[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]].

==Structure and mechanism==

{{see also|Heparin#Mechanism of action}}

Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide Factor Xa inhibitor. Apart from the O-methyl group at the reducing end of the molecule, the identity and sequence of the five monomeric sugar units contained in fondaparinux is identical to a sequence of five monomeric sugar units that can be isolated after either chemical or enzymatic cleavage of the polymeric [[glycosaminoglycan]]s [[heparin]] and [[heparan sulfate]] (HS). Within heparin and heparan sulfate this monomeric sequence is thought to form the high affinity binding site for the anti-coagulant factor [[antithrombin III]] (ATIII). Binding of heparin/HS to ATIII  has been shown to increase the anti-coagulant activity of antithrombin III 1000 fold. In contrast to heparin, fondaparinux does not inhibit [[thrombin]].

==Administration==
Fondaparinux is given subcutaneously daily.  Clinically, it is used for the prevention of [[deep vein thrombosis]] in patients who have had orthopedic surgery as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and [[pulmonary embolism]].

==Comparison to other agents==
One potential advantage of fondaparinux over LMWH or unfractionated heparin is that the risk for [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT) is substantially lower.  Furthermore, there have been case reports of fondaparinux being used to anticoagulate patients with established HIT as it has no affinity to PF-4.  However, its renal excretion precludes its use in patients with renal dysfunction.

Unlike [[direct factor Xa inhibitor]]s, it mediates its effects indirectly through [[antithrombin III]], but unlike [[heparin]], it is selective for [[factor X]]a.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456874_5 |title=Medscape.com  |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref>

==Uses==
Fondaparinux is similar to [[enoxaparin]] in reducing the risk of ischemic events at nine days, but it substantially reduces major bleeding and improves long term mortality and morbidity.<ref name="urlNEJM -- Comparison of Fondaparinux and Enoxaparin in Acute Coronary Syndromes">{{cite web |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/354/14/1464 |title=NEJM -- Comparison of Fondaparinux and Enoxaparin in Acute Coronary Syndromes |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref>

It has been investigated for use in conjunction with [[streptokinase]].<ref name="pmid18245119">{{cite journal |author=Peters RJ, Joyner C, Bassand JP, ''et al.'' |title=The role of fondaparinux as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction: a subgroup analysis of the OASIS-6 trial |journal=Eur.
