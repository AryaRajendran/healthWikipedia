The '''olfactory system''' is the [[sensory system]] used for [[olfaction]], or the sense of smell. Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system: a ''main olfactory system'' and an [[accessory olfactory system]]. The main olfactory system detects volatile, airborne substances, while the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence indicates that most often, the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are [[pheromones]].

The olfactory system is often spoken of along with the [[gustatory system]] as the '''chemosensory senses''' because both [[transduction (physiology)|transduce]] chemical signals into [[perception]].

==Function==
The mechanism of the olfactory system can be divided into a peripheral one, sensing an external [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] and encoding it as an electric signal in [[neurons]], and a central one, where all signals are integrated and processed in the [[central nervous system]].

===Peripheral===

In mammals, the main olfactory system detects odorants that are inhaled through the [[nose]], where they contact the main [[olfactory epithelium]], which contains various [[olfactory receptor]]s. These olfactory receptors are [[membrane proteins]] of bipolar [[olfactory receptor neuron]]s in the olfactory epithelium. Rather than binding specific [[ligands]] like most receptors, olfactory receptors display affinity for a range of odor molecules. Olfactory neurons transduce receptor activation into electrical signals in [[neurons]]. The signals travel along the [[olfactory nerve]], which belongs to the [[peripheral nervous system]]. This nerve terminates in the [[olfactory bulb]], which belongs to the [[central nervous system]]. The complex set of olfactory receptors on different olfactory neurons can distinguish a new odor from the background environmental odors and determine the concentration of the odor.

===Central===
[[Axon]]s from the olfactory sensory neurons converge in the [[olfactory bulb]] to form tangles called [[glomerulus (olfaction)|glomeruli]] (singular glomerulus). Inside the glomerulus, the axons contact the [[dendrite]]s of [[mitral cells]] and several other types of cells. Mitral cells send their axons to a number of brain areas, including the [[anterior olfactory nucleus]], [[piriform cortex]], the medial [[amygdala]], and the [[entorhinal cortex]].

The pirifocv cortex is probably the area most closely associated with identifying the odor. The medial [[amygdala]] is involved in social functions such as mating and the recognition of animals of the same species. The [[entorhinal cortex]] is associated with memory, e.g. to pair odors with proper memories. The exact functions of these higher areas are a matter of scientific research and debate.

In the central nervous system, odors are represented as patterns of neural activity. These representations may be encoded by space (a pattern of activated [[neurons]] across a given olfactory region corresponds to the odor), time (a pattern of [[action potential]]s by multiple neurons corresponds to the odor) or a combination of the two. Scientists debate whether the odor code is primarily temporal or spatial.

==Clinical implications==
Damage to the olfactory system can occur by [[traumatic brain injury]], [[cancer]], infection, inhalation of toxic fumes, or neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. These conditions can cause [[anosmia]]. In contrast, recent finding suggested the molecular aspects of olfactory dysfunction can be recognized as a hallmark of amyloidogenesis-related diseases and there may even be a causal link through the disruption of multivalent metal ion transport and storage ([http://download.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/pdf/PIIS0167779912001461.pdf?intermediate=true M. Mahmoudi and K. S. Suslick 2012]).  Doctors can detect damage to the olfactory system by presenting the patient with odors via a scratch and sniff card or by having the patient close their eyes and try to identify commonly available odors like coffee or peppermint candy.
Doctors must exclude other diseases that inhibit or eliminate 'the sense of smell' such as chronic cold of sinusitus before making the diagnois that there is permanent damage to the olfactory system.

==History==
[[Linda B. Buck]] and [[Richard Axel]] won the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work on the olfactory system.
