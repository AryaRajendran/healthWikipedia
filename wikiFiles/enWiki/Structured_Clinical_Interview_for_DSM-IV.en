The '''Structured Clinical Interview for [[DSM-IV]]''' Axis I Disorders ('''SCID-I''') is a diagnostic exam used to determine [[DSM-IV]] [[Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#Multi-axial_system|Axis]] I disorders (major [[mental disorder]]s) and Axis II disorders ([[personality disorder]]s). There are at least 700 published studies in which the SCID was the diagnostic instrument used. Major parts of the SCID have been translated into other languages, including [[Danish language|Danish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and  [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

An Axis I SCID assessment with a psychiatric patient usually takes between 1 and 2 hours, depending on the complexity of the past psychiatric history and the subject's ability to clearly describe episodes of current and past symptoms. A SCID with a non-psychiatric patient takes 1/2 hour to 1-1/2 hours. (See editions below.) A '''SCID-II''' personality assessment takes about 1/2 to 1 hour.

The instrument was designed to be administered by a [[clinician]] or trained mental health professional, for example a [[psychologist]] or medical doctor. This must be someone who has relevant professional training and has had experience performing unstructured, [[open-ended question]], diagnostic evaluations. However, for the purposes of some research studies, non-clinician research assistants, who have extensive experience with the study population in question, and who have demonstrated competence, have been trained to use the SCID. The less clinical experience and specific education the potential interviewer has had, the more training is required.

==DSM-IV editions of SCID-I and SCID-II==

==DSM-III editions of SCID-I and SCID-II==
{{Ref improve section|date=October 2010}}

The DSM-III SCID had one edition per axis: SCID-P/SCID-NP<ref>Spitzer, Robert L, Williams Janet BW, Gibbon Miriam, First Michael B, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Patient Edition/Non-patient Edition,(SCID-P/SCID-NP), Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1990.</ref> and SCID-II.<ref>Spitzer, Robert L, Williams Janet BW, Gibbon Miriam, First Michael B, Structured Clinican Interview for DSM-III-R Axis II Disorders,(SCID-II), Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1990</ref>

The [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity]] of the SCID for DSM-III-R has been reported in several published studies. With regard to reliability, the range in reliability is enormous, depending on the type of the sample and research methodology (i.e., joint vs. test-retest, multi-site vs. single site with raters who have worked together, etc.)

==SCID-D==
The ''Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV'' [[Dissociative disorders]] (SCID-D)<ref name="SCID-D">Steinberg M: [http://www.appi.org/set.cfm?id=8862 Interviewers Guide to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D)]. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Press, 1994.</ref> is widely used to diagnose [[dissociative disorders]], especially in research settings. This interview takes about 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on individual's experiences. The SCID-D has been translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and used in the Netherlands.<ref name = "pmid2006691">{{cite journal |author=Boon S, Draijer N |title=Diagnosing dissociative disorders in The Netherlands: a pilot study with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Dissociative Disorders |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=148 |issue=4 |pages=458â€“62 |year=1991 |pmid=2006691 |doi=}}</ref>
