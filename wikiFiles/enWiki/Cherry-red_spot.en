A '''cherry-red spot''' is a finding in the [[macula]] of the [[eye]] in a variety of [[lipid storage]] disorders and in [[central retinal artery occlusion]].<ref>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1577451524 General Practice Notebook]</ref>
It describes the appearance of a small circular choroid shape as seen through the [[fovea centralis]].
<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cherry-red+spot Medical Dictionary]</ref>  Its appearance is due to a relative transparency of the macula; storage disorders cause the accumulation of storage material within the cell layers of the retina, however, the macula, which is relatively devoid of cellular layers, does not build up this material, and thus allows the eye to see through the macula to the red choroid below. <ref>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/text.asp?2008/54/1/54/39196 Suvarna JC, Hajela SA.

The sign was first described by Warren Tay, founding member of the British Ophthalmological Society, in 1881, with reference to a patient with [[Tay-Sachs disease]].

The cherry red spot is seen in [[central retinal artery occlusion]], appearing several hours after the blockage of the [[retinal artery]] occurs.<ref name="Rakel">Rakel, Robert E., Textbook of Family Medicine, 7th ed, Chapter 53</ref>  The cherry red spot is seen because the macula receives its blood supply from the choroid, supplied by the posterior ciliary arteries, while the surrounding retina is pale due to retinal artery infarction.<ref>""USMLE First AID 2010 page 417</ref> It is also seen in several other conditions, classically [[Tay-Sachs Disease]], but also in [[Niemann-Pick Disease]], [[Sandhoff disease]], and [[mucolipidosis]].
