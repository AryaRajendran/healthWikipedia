In the United Kingdom, the IUD with progestogen is referred to as an '''intrauterine system (IUS)''' or intrauterine contraceptive (IUC). This article will refer to these devices as the hormonal IUD to distinguish from [[IUD with copper]]. Mirena is one brand available in the United States.

==Composition and hormonal release==
The hormonal IUD is a small 'T'-shaped piece of plastic, which contains [[levonorgestrel]], a type of progestogen.<ref name= Mirena>[http://www.mirena-us.com/], Bayer Pharmaceuticals.</ref>
The cylinder of the device contains the hormone and is coated with a membrane that regulates the release of levonorgestrel.<ref name=Luu1991>{{citation

}}</ref>
Mirena releases the hormone at an initial rate of 20 micrograms per day and declines to a rate of 14 micrograms after 5 years, which is still in the range of clinical effectiveness. 
Skyla releases 14 micrograms per day and declines to 5 micrograms per day after 3 years.<ref name=SkylaFDA>{{cite report| title= Highlights of Prescribing Information|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory#apphist | date=2013-01-09 }}</ref>
In comparison, oral contraceptives can contain 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel.<ref name="Dean 2011">{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=Gillian|last2=Schwarz|first2=Eleanor Bimla|year=2011|chapter=Intrauterine contraceptives (IUCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.|title=Contraceptive technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn=0091-9721|oclc=781956734|pages=147–191}} p.150:<blockquote>Mechanism of action<br/> Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, currently available IUCs work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing ova.<sup>26</sup> IUCs are not abortifacients: they do not interrupt an implanted pregnancy.<sup>27</sup> Pregnancy is prevented by a combination of the "foreign body effect" of the plastic or metal frame and the specific action of the medication (copper or levonorgestrel) that is released.

The hormonal IUD releases the levonorgestrel directly into the [[uterus]], as such its effects are mostly [[paracrine]] rather than systemic. Most of the hormone stays inside the uterus, and only a small amount is absorbed into the rest of the body.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> Blood levels of levonorgestrel in Mirena users are half those found in Norplant users and one-tenth those found in users of levonorgestrel-only pills).<!--

==Insertion and removal==
The hormonal IUD is inserted in a similar procedure to the nonhormonal copper IUD, and can only be inserted by a qualified medical practitioner.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> Before insertion, a pelvic exam is performed to examine the shape and position of the uterus. It is also recommended that patients be tested for [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] prior to insertion, as a current STI at the time of insertion can increase the risk of pelvic infection.<ref name=Moh2006>{{citation

}}</ref>
During the insertion, the vagina is held open with a speculum, the same device used during a pap smear.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> A grasping instrument is used to steady the cervix, the length of the uterus is measured for proper insertion, and the IUD is placed using a narrow tube through the opening of the cervix into the uterus.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> A short length of monofilament plastic/nylon string hangs down from the cervix into the vagina. The string allows physicians and patients to check to ensure the IUD is still in place and enables easy removal of the device.<ref name="Dean 2011"/> Mild to moderate cramping can occur during the procedure, which generally takes five minutes or less. Insertion can be performed immediately postpartum and post-abortion if no infection has occurred.<ref name= CDC2010>{{citation

The hormonal IUD is considered to be a [[long-acting reversible contraceptive]], among the most effective forms of birth control. The first year failure rate for the hormonal IUD is .2% and the five year failure rate is .7%.<ref name= Mirena /> These rates are comparable to tubal sterilization, but the effects of the hormonal IUD are reversible. 

The hormonal IUD is considered to be more effective than other common forms of reversible contraception, such as the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]], because it requires little to no action by the user after insertion.<ref name= Winner2012 /> The effectiveness of other forms of birth control is mitigated by the users themselves. If medication regimens for contraception are not followed precisely, the method becomes less effective. IUDs require no daily, weekly, or monthly regimen, so their typical use failure rate is therefore the same as their perfect use failure rate.<ref name=Winner2012 />

==Mechanisms of action==
The hormonal IUD's primary mechanism of action is to prevent fertilization.<ref name="Dean 2011"/><ref name="Ortiz 2007">{{cite journal|last1=Ortiz|first1=María Elena|last2=Croxatto|first2=Horacio B.|month=June|year=2007|title=Copper-T intrauterine device and levonorgestrel intrauterine system: biological bases of their mechanism of action|journal=Contraception|volume=75|issue=6 Suppl|pages=S16‒S30|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2007.01.020|pmid=17531610}} p. S28:<blockquote>Conclusions<br/>Active substances released from the IUD or IUS, together with products derived from the inflammatory reaction present in the luminal fluids of the genital tract, are toxic for spermatozoa and oocytes, preventing the encounter of healthy gametes and the formation of viable embryos. The current data do not indicate that embryos are formed in IUD users at a rate comparable to that of nonusers. The common belief that the usual mechanism of action of IUDs in women is destruction of embryos in the uterus is not supported by empirical evidence. The bulk of the data indicate that interference with the reproductive process after fertilization has taken place is exceptional in the presence of a T-Cu or LNG-IUD and that the usual mechanism by which they prevent pregnancy in women is by preventing fertilization.</blockquote></ref><ref name="ESHRE 2008">{{cite journal|author=[[European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology|ESHRE]] [[Capri]] Workshop Group|momth=May‒June|year=2008|title=Intrauterine devices and intrauterine systems|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=14|issue=3|pages=197‒208|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmn003|pmid=18400840}} p. 199:<blockquote>Mechanisms of action<br/>Thus, both clinical and experimental evidence suggests that IUDs can prevent and disrupt implantation. It is unlikely, however, that this is the main IUD mode of action, … The best evidence indicates that in IUD users it is unusual for embryos to reach the uterus.<br/>In conclusion, IUDs may exert their contraceptive action at different levels. Potentially, they interfere with sperm function and transport within the uterus and tubes. It is difficult to determine whether fertilization of the oocyte is impaired by these compromised sperm. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that IUDs can prevent and disrupt implantation. The extent to which this interference contributes to its contraceptive action is unknown. The data are scanty and the political consequences of resolving this issue interfere with comprehensive research.<br/>p. 205:<br/>Summary<br/>IUDs that release copper or levonorgestrel are extremely effective contraceptives... Both copper IUDs and levonorgestrel releasing IUSs may interfere with implantation, although this may not be the primary mechanism of action. The devices also create barriers to sperm transport and fertilization, and sensitive assays detect hCG in less than 1% of cycles, indicating that significant prevention must occur before the stage of implantation.</blockquote></ref><ref name="Speroff 2011">{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Intrauterine contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=239–280|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}} pp. 246–247:<blockquote>Mechanism of action<br/>The contraceptive action of all IUDs is mainly in the intrauterine cavity. Ovulation is not affected, and the IUD is not an abortifacient.<sup>58–60</sup> It is currently believed that the mechanism of action for IUDs is the production of an intrauterine environment that is spermicidal.<br/>Nonmedicated IUDs depend for contraception on the general reaction of the uterus to a foreign body. It is believed that this reaction, a sterile inflammatory response, produces tissue injury of a minor degree but sufficient enough to be spermicidal. Very few, if any, sperm reach the ovum in the fallopian tube.<br/>The progestin-releasing IUD adds the endometrial action of the progestin to the foreign body reaction. The endometrium becomes decidualized with atrophy of the glands.<sup>65</sup> The progestin IUD probably has two mechanisms of action: inhibition of implantation and inhibition of sperm capacitation, penetration, and survival.</blockquote></ref><ref name="Jensen 2012">{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Jeffrey T.|last2=Mishell|first2=Daniel R.

Because concern over mechanism of action represents a barrier to acceptance of this important and highly effective method for some women and some clinicians, it is important to point out that there is no evidence to suggest that the mechanism of action of IUDs is abortifacient.<br/>The LNG-IUS, like the copper device, has a very low ectopic pregnancy rate. Therefore, fertilization does not occur and its main mechanism of action is also preconceptual. Less inflammation occurs within the uterus of LNG-IUS users, but the potent progestin effect thickens cervical mucus to impede sperm penetration and access to the upper genital track. Although the LNG-IUS also produces a thin, inactive endometrium, there is no evidence to suggest that this will prevent implantation, and the device should not be used for emergency contraception.</blockquote></ref>  The levonorgestrel intrauterine system has several contraceptive effects:

*'''Ovarian Cysts''': Enlarged follicles (ovarian cysts) have been diagnosed in about 12% of the subjects using a hormonal IUD. Most of these follicles are asymptomatic, although some may be accompanied by pelvic pain or dyspareunia. In most cases the enlarged follicles disappear spontaneously after two to three months. Surgical intervention is not usually required.<ref name=Baha2003>{{citation

In the rare cases when this is unsuccessful, an ultrasound scan may be arranged to check the position of the coil and exclude its perforation through into the abdominal cavity or its unrecognised previous expulsion.

==History==
Hormonal IUD were developed following the development of the copper IUD in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=Thiery1997>{{citation

This IUD had a short, 1-year lifespan and never achieved widespread popularity. Following this relative lack of success, Dr. Luukkainen replaced the progesterone with the hormone levonorgestrel to be released over a 5-year period, creating what is now Mirena.<ref name=Thiery2000>{{citation

There are conflicting recommendations about use of Mirena while breastfeeding.  The U.S. FDA does not recommend any hormonal method, including Mirena, as a first choice of contraceptive for nursing mothers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The World Health Organization recommends against immediate postpartum insertion, citing increased expulsion rates.  It also reports concerns about potential effects on the infant's liver and brain development in the first six weeks postpartum.  However, it recommends offering Mirena as a contraceptive option beginning at six weeks postpartum even to nursing women.<!--

==Unproven effects==

===Cancer rates===
According to a 1999 evaluation of the studies performed on progestin-only birth control by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there is some evidence that progestin-only birth control reduces the risk of endometrial cancer.  The IARC concluded that there is no evidence progestin-only birth control increases the risk of any cancer, though the available studies were too small to be definitively conclusive.<!--
