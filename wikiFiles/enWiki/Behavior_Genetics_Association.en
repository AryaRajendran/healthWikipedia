The '''Behavior Genetics Association''' is a [[learned society]] that was established in 1970 and promotes research into the connection between [[heredity]] and [[behavior]].

== Aims ==
The association's goal is "to promote scientific study of the interrelationship of genetic mechanisms and behavior, both human and animal; to encourage and aid the education and training of research workers in the field of behavior genetics; and to aid in the dissemination and interpretation to the general public of knowledge concerning the interrelationship of genetics and behavior, and its implications for health and human development and education." To help attain these goals, the society organizes an annual meeting and publishes its official  [[scientific journal]] entitled ''[[Behavior Genetics (journal)|Behavior Genetics]]''.<ref name=home>{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/1/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> The first 12 annual meetings were held in different places within the United States. In 1983, the association held its first annual meeting in Europe (London) and since then meetings have been held in the US, alternating with venues in Europe, Australia, and Korea.<ref name=list />

== Membership ==
The society has two classes of members: Regular Members, which are persons who teach or perform research related to [[behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]], and Associate Members, which are students in good standing at a recognized college or university.<ref name=members>{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/17/Apply_for_membership.html |title=Apply for membership |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> Members receive a complimentary subscription to the society's journal as well as discounted registration rates for the association's annual meetings.<ref name=membership>{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/6/Membership.html |title=Membership |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>

The society's business are conducted by a [[board of directors]], called the [[Committee#Executive committee|executive committee]].<ref name=bylaws>{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/11/ByLaws.html |title=BGA - By-Laws |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> The board consists of 8 members: president, president-elect, past-president, secretary, [[treasurer]], and three members-at-large (one representing the general membership, one representing associate members, and one representing members from outside North America).<ref name=ExCom>{{cite web |url=http://www.bga.org/pages/10/Executive_Committee.html |title=Executive Committee |publisher=Behavior Genetics Association |work=bga.org |accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> Members of the executive committee serve three-year terms. To ensure continuity, one member-at-large is elected every year.<ref name=ExCom />
