'''Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy,''' also referred to as [[mucolipidosis]] III (ML III), is a [[lysosomal storage disease]] closely related to [[I-cell disease]] (ML II).<ref name="pmid16630736">{{cite journal |author=Bargal R |title=When Mucolipidosis III meets Mucolipidosis II: GNPTA gene mutations in 24 patients |journal=Mol.

==Pathophysiology==
As in Mucolipidosis II, Mucolipidosis III results from genetic defects in GlcNAc phosphotransferase ([[N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase]]). However, ML III produces less severe symptoms and progresses more slowly, probably because the defect in GlcNAc phosphotranspherase lies in its protein recognition domain.<ref>Murray, R, Granner, D, and Rodwell, V. (2006). Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry. 27th ed. New York: Lange Medical Books/McGraw-Hill.</ref> Therefore, the catalytic domain retains some of its activity, resulting in a smaller accumulation of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the inclusion bodies.

==Presentation==
Symptoms of ML III are often not noticed until the child is 3–5 years of age.  Patients with ML III are generally of normal [[intelligence]] (trait) or have only mild [[mental retardation]]. These patients usually have skeletal abnormalities, coarse facial features, short height, corneal clouding, [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[aortic valve]] disease and mild enlargement of organs.  Some children with severe forms of this disease do not live beyond childhood.  However, there is a great variability among patients - there are diagnosed individuals with ML III living in their sixties.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for Pseudo-Hurler Polydystrophy/Mucolipidosis IIIA. Treatment is limited to controlling or reducing symptoms associated with this disorder. Physio-therapy, particularly [[hydrotherapy]] has proven effective at relieving muscle stiffness and increasing mobility. The use of crutches, a wheelchair or scooters are treatment options as the metabolic bone disease progresses. The insertion of rods in the spine to stabilize the vulnerable areas can treat [[scoliosis]]. Heart valve replacement surgery may be necessary as this disorder progresses.
