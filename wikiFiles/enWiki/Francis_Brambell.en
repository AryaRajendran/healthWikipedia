'''Francis William Rogers Brambell''' (25 February 1901 – 6 June 1970) was a British medical scientist.

He was born in [[Sandycove]], Dublin and was educated (1911–1914) at Aravon School and then privately, specializing in zoology. 

He was appointed Lloyd Roberts Professor and Head of the Department of Zoology at [[Bangor University|Bangor]] in 1930 at the age of 29; from that time until his retirement 38 years later he brought great and increasing distinction to his Department and College. He was the father of the field of transmission of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], which he entered 50 years ago. As part of his quantitative and temporal studies on transmission, he defined the first [[Fc receptor]] system for [[IgG]], and furthermore recognized the link between transmission of [[passive immunity]] from mother to young and protection from [[catabolism]] for IgG.

He wrote ''Antibodies and Embryos'' with W. A. Hemmings and M. Henderson in 1951.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March, 1949 <ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27brambell%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher = Royal Society| accessdate= 18 December 2010}}</ref> and won their [[Royal Medal]] in 1964 "In recognition of his important contribution to our understanding of the passage of protein from maternal to foetal circulations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/honors/968/000100668/|title=Royal Medal|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref>
