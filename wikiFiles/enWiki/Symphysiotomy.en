'''Symphysiotomy''' is a surgical procedure in which the [[cartilage]] of the [[pubic symphysis]] is divided to widen the [[pelvis]] allowing [[childbirth]] when there is a mechanical problem.  It is also known as '''pelviotomy''',<REF NAME="dictionary"/> '''synchondrotomy,''',<ref name="dictionary">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/symphysiotomy symphysiotomy], The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved March 22, 2012, from Dictionary.com.</ref> '''pubiotomy''',<REF NAME="HUNTER"/> and '''Gigli's operation''' after [[Leonardo Gigli]], who invented a saw commonly used in Europe to accomplish the operation.

==Introduction==
Symphysiotomy was advocated in 1597 by [[:fr:Séverin Pineau|Severin Pineau]] after his description of a [[Diastasis symphysis pubis|diastasis of the pubis]] on a hanged pregnant 
woman.<ref>Dumont M: La longue et laborieuse naissance de la symphyséotomie ou de Séverin Pineau à Jean-René Sigault. J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod 1989;18:11-21</ref>  Thus symphysiotomies became a routine surgical procedure for women experiencing an obstructed labour. They became less frequent in the late 19th century after the risk of maternal death post-[[caesarean section]] decreased due to improvement in techniques, hygiene, and clinical practice.<ref>Bergstrsm S, Lublin H, Molin A: Value of Symphysiotomy in Obstructed Labour Management and Follow-up of 31 Cases. Gynecol Obstet Invest 1994;38:31-35</ref>

==Indications for the procedure ==
The most common indications are a trapped head of a [[breech presentation|breech baby]], [[shoulder dystocia]] which does not resolve with routine manoeuvres and obstructed labor at full [[cervical dilation]] when there is no option of a [[caesarean section]]. Currently the procedure is rarely performed in developed countries, but is still routine in developing countries where caesarean section is not always an option.<ref name="pmid17388656">{{cite journal |author=Verkuyl DA |title=Think globally act locally: the case for symphysiotomy |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e71 |year=2007 |pmid=17388656 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040071 |pmc=1831724}}</ref>

==Surgical application==
Symphysiotomy results in a temporary increase in pelvic diameter (up to 2&nbsp;cm) by surgically dividing the [[ligaments]] of the [[symphysis]] under local anaesthesia. This procedure should be carried out only in combination with [[vacuum extraction]]. Symphysiotomy in combination with vacuum extraction can be a life-saving procedure in areas of the world where caesarean section is not feasible or immediately available. Since this procedure does not scar the [[uterus]], the concern of future uterine rupture that exists with cesarean section is not a factor.<ref>Safe motherhood: cesarean section or symphysiotomy? J. van Roosmalen Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1990 Jul;163(1 Pt 1):1-4.</ref>

The procedure is not without risk, including urethral and bladder injury, infection, pain and long-term walking difficulty. Symphysiotomy should, therefore, be carried out only when there is no safe alternative.<ref name="multiple">Managing complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A guide for Midwives and Doctors. [[World Health Organization]]</ref>  It is advised that this procedure should not be repeated due to the risk of [[gait]] problems and continual pain.<ref>Symphysiotomy and subsequent pregnancy in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. East African Medical Journal. 1978 Jul;55(7):306-13. Armon PJ; Philip M.</ref>

Abduction of the thighs more than 45 degrees from the midline may cause tearing of the urethra and bladder. 
# Give appropriate analgesic drugs.
# Apply elastic strapping across the front of the pelvis from one iliac crest to the other to stabilize the symphysis and reduce pain.
# Leave the catheter in the bladder for a minimum of 5 days.
# Encourage the woman to drink plenty of fluids to ensure a good urinary output.
# Encourage [[bed rest]] for 7 days after discharge from hospital.
# Encourage the woman to begin to walk with assistance when she is ready to do so.
 
If long-term walking difficulties and pain are reported (occur in 2% of cases), treat with physical therapy.<ref name="multiple"/>

==Symphysiotomy in Ireland==
It is estimated that 1,500 Irish women unknowingly and without consent underwent symphysiotomies during childbirth between 1944—1992.<REF NAME="Adams"/>  Some survivors were left with severe lifelong after effects, including extreme pain, impaired mobility, incontinence, and depression.<ref name="HUNTER">Hunter, Niall.[http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=16909 A symphysiotomy victim's story], February 19, 2010.  ''Irish Health''.</ref><REF NAME="Adams"/> Then-[[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]], [[Mary Harney]], ruled out a review on 19 February 2010.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0219/symphysiotomy.html Symphysiotomy inquiry ruled out]. RTÉ. Friday, 19 February 2010 19:49.</ref>

However, gathering public outrage eventually resulted in hearings on 15 March 2012.  At that time, Sinn Féin leader [[Gerry Adams]] spoke at length to the press, linking the cause of the symphysiotomy survivors with other civil rights causes:
<blockquote>These groups include [[Magdalene Asylum|Justice for the Maggies]], for other victims of institutionalised abuse, including in Bethany Home,<ref>[http://www.paddydoyle.com/making-amends-for-bethany-home/ Making amends for Bethany Home], ''Irish Times'', September 14, 2010.</ref> and in our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda,<ref>Heffernan, Breda. [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/mired-in-scandals-disgraced-doctors-and-misdiagnoses-2211019.html Mired in Scandals, Disgraced Doctors, and Misdiagnoses], ''The Independent,'' (Ireland),  June 8, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/scannal/Neary.html Dr. Michael Neary — Consipiracy of Silence], RTE Television.</ref> and victims of symphysiotomy.  All these causes are crying out for justice. They have been failed by this state. That wrong can be righted. We as Teachtaí Dala, elected by our peers, have a duty to make this happen....Given the increasing age of the victims and the chronic pain and constant medical intervention they require as a result of symphysiotomy, it is urgent that <nowiki>[</nowiki>current Health Minister Dr. James Reilly<nowiki>]</nowiki> deal with this now.<REF NAME="Adams">[http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/symphysiotomy-issue-gets-first-dail-hearing-543653.html Symphysiotomy issue gets first Dail hearing], ''Irish Examiner'', March 15, 2012.</ref></blockquote>

Adams described the procedure as "institutional abuse involving acts of butchery against women."<REF NAME="Adams"/>  Eight days later, on 23 March 2012, a [[County Louth]] woman subjected to a symphysiotomy was awarded €450,000 by the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0323/symphysiotomy.html|title=Woman awarded €450k over symphysiotomy|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>

As of the 10th of July 2012 the amount of €450k has been reduced by the high court to €350k

In June 2012, details of a draft report on the use of this procedure in Ireland was released. The report by Prof. Oonagh Walsh (UCC) found that although symphysiostomies were phased out in most medical institutions across the country, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was practising the procedure up until the early 1980s.<ref>"Report Shows Figures for Birth Procedure."
