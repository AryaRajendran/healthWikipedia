The '''paramedian reticular nucleus''' (in [[Terminologia Anatomica]], or '''paramedian medullary reticular group''' in [[NeuroNames]]) sends its connections to the spinal cord in a mostly ipsilateral manner, although there is some decussation. 

It projects to the [[vermis]] in the anterior lobe, the pyramis and the [[uvula]]. 

The paramedian nucleus also projects to the contralateral PRN, the [[gigantocellular nucleus]], and the [[nucleus ambiguous]].<ref>Jouvet, M. Handbook of clinical neurology vol 3. P. J. Vinken and G. W. Bruyen, eds. North Holland Publishing company. Amsterdam (1969).</ref>

The paramedian reticular formation is adjacent to the abducens (VI)nucleus in the pons and adjacent to the oculomotor nucleus(III) in the midbrain. 

The paramedian nucleus receives afferents mostly from the [[fastigial nucleus]] in the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex; however, the projections from the spinal cord are very sparse. 

The descending afferent connections come mostly from the frontal and parietal lobes; however the pontine reticular formation also sends projections to the paramedian reticular nucleus.

There are also very sparse innervations from the [[superior colliculus]]. 

Lesions in the paramedian reticular nucleus have been shown to cause a stereotyped increase in the random patterns of motion in rats.<ref>Lee EH, et al. Multiple inhibitory actions of the paramedian reticular nucleus&mdash;effects on blood pressure and motor activities in rats. Chin J Physiol. 1990;33(1):49-61.</ref> The paramedian nuclei on either side of the brain stem have been shown to mediate the horizontal [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]] on their [[ipsilateral]] sides. It seems possible that the random motion patterns of the above rats were caused by an inability to mediate their horizontal eye movements.
