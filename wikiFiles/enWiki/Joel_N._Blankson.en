==Training and career==
In 1995, Blankson received an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] he earned at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University|Cornell University Medical School]], now known as Weil Cornell, in [[New York City]], [[New York]].<ref name=DP>[http://www.doctorpricing.com/doctors/de/wilmington/joel-blankson/449738.php Physician Information - Joel Blankson, MD]</ref> His [[PhD]] was awarded by [[Rockefeller University]] in 1996 as part of a [[MD/PhD|joint MD-PhD program]] with Cornell and [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Sloan-Kettering]].<ref>[http://runews.rockefeller.edu/index.php?id=202&page=engine&printer=1 Rockefeller University News, June 16, 1996]</ref> At Rockefeller, Blankson conducted [[immunology]] research with [[Stephen S. Morse]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|7635522}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|7518754}}</ref>

Blankson completed residencies in infectious diseases and internal medicine at Johns Hopkins. He has practiced medicine in [[Delaware]] and Maryland.<ref name=DP/> He is currently an associate professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and also collaborates closely with the Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2574413/ PLoS One article; see acknowledgements]</ref>

==Research==
After his PhD research on [[immunology]] and residencies at Johns Hopkins, Blankson investigated HIV at Johns Hopkins with [[Robert Siliciano]]. Their work together has included research on HIV pathogenesis,<ref>{{Cite pmid|11069234}}</ref> immune reconstitution,<ref>{{Cite pmid|11170994}}</ref> control of viremia,<ref>{{Cite pmid|11238554}}</ref> and [[Viral latency|HIV viral reservoirs]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|11818490}}</ref> They also reviewed the concept of "structured therapeutic interruption."<ref>{{Cite pmid|12184252}}</ref>

More recently, Blankson has led investigations of ''elite suppressors'' of HIV-1 infection. Elite suppressors are people who are infected with HIV-1 but naturally suppress the [[Viremia|amount of virus in their blood]] to very low, almost undetectable levels without use of [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral drugs]]. Only 1 HIV-positive person out of approximately 300 is in this category. Blankson and other investigators suggest the biological mechanisms of this rare phenomenon may hold the key to new treatments for HIV.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19837464}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|19733595}}</ref> From 2007 to 2009, Blankson published about 20 scientific articles on elite suppressors,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed PubMed search] for Blankson JN</ref> and he has been interviewed extensively in the popular and scientific press.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080812064347.htm "Why Some Infected With HIV Remain Symptom Free Without Antiretroviral Drugs"] ''Science Daily,'' August 13, 2008.</ref><ref name="reuters1"/><ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/HIVAIDS/HIVAIDS/10519 "Rare Case Suggests Immune Control of HIV Possible"] Michael Smith, ''MedPage Today,'' August 12, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/09/01/hlbf0901.htm "News in brief - Sept. 1, 2008"] "Study examines HIV resistance," ''American Medical News,'' September 1, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.aerztezeitung.de/medizin/krankheiten/infektionskrankheiten/aids/?sid=507328 ''Aerzte Zeitung'' (''Doctors' News'') (in German)] "Zehn Jahre HIV infiziert - trotzdem fast kerngesund" ("Ten years with HIV - yet almost completely healthy"), August 15, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Mundo/0,,MUL724480-5602,00.html Globo.com (in Portuguese)] "Algumas pessoas têm defesa natural contra aids, revela estudo," ''Globo,'' August 14, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/136300/Istnieja-ludzie-odporni-na-HIV/ WProst24 (in Polish)] "Istnieją ludzie odporni na HIV," August 14, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.vanguardia.com/archivo/4171-algunas-personas-poseen-defensa-natural-contra-sida Vanguardia.com (in Spanish)] "Algunas personas poseen defensa natural contra Sida" ("Some people have natural defenses against AIDS"), ''Vanguardia'' (Colombia), August 16, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.italiainformazioni.com/giornale/salute/26290/forse-speranza-debellare-laids-medici-studiano-caso-donna-affetta-anni-senza-sintomi.htm italiainformazioni.com (in Italian)] "Forse c'è una speranza per debellare l'Aids.
