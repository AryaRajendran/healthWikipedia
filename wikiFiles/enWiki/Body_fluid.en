'''Body fluid''', '''bodily fluids''',  or '''biofluids''' are [[liquid]]s originating from inside the [[human body|bodies of living people]]. They include fluids that are [[excretion|excreted]] or [[secretion|secreted]] from the body as well as [[body water]] that normally is not.

The dominating content of body fluids is [[animal body water|body water]]. Approximately 60-65% of body water is contained within the cells (in [[intracellular fluid]]) with the other 35-40% of body water contained outside the cells (in [[extracellular fluid]]). This fluid component outside of the cells includes the fluid between the cells ([[interstitial fluid]]), [[lymph]] and [[blood]]. There are approximately 6 to 10 liters of lymph in the body, compared to 3.5 to 5 liters of blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diagnose-me.com/cond/C162576.html |title=Lymphatic Congestion - Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment and Information |publisher=Diagnose-me.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref>

==Body fluids and health==
'''Body fluid''' is the term most often used in medical and health contexts. Modern [[medical]], [[public health]], and personal [[hygiene]] practices treat body fluids as potentially unclean. This is because they can be [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s for infectious diseases, such as [[sexually transmitted disease]]s or [[blood-borne disease]]s.  [[Universal precautions]] and [[safer sex]] practices try to avoid exchanges of body fluids.  Body fluids can be analysed in [[medical laboratory]] in order to find microbes, inflammation, cancers, etc.

===Sampling===
Methods of [[sampling (medicine)|sampling]] of body fluids include:
*''Blood sampling'' for any [[blood test]], in turn including:
**[[Artery|Arterial]] blood sampling, such as [[radial artery puncture]]
**[[Venous]] blood sampling, also called [[venipuncture]]
*[[Lumbar puncture]] to sample [[cerebrospinal fluid]]
*[[Thoracocentesis]] to sample [[pleural fluid]]
*[[Amniocentesis]] to sample [[amniotic fluid]]

==Bodily fluids in religion and history==
Many bodily fluids are regarded with varying levels of disgust among world cultures, including the [[Abrahamic faiths]] (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) and Hinduism.

==Body fluids in art==
A relatively new trend in [[contemporary art]] is to use '''[[body fluids in art]],''' though there have been rarer uses of blood (and perhaps feces) for quite some time, and [[Marcel Duchamp]] used [[semen]] decades ago.  Examples include:

* The controversial ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1987), by [[Andres Serrano]], which is a [[photograph]] of a [[crucifix]] submerged in [[urine]];
* [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''Oxidations'' series, begun in 1977, in which he invited friends to urinate onto a canvas of metallic copper pigments, so that the uric acid would oxidize into abstract patterns;
* ''Self'' (1991, recast 1996)  by [[Marc Quinn]], a frozen cast of the artist's head made entirely of his own [[blood]];
* ''Piss Flowers,'' by [[Helen Chadwick]] (1991-92), are twelve white-enameled bronzes cast from cavities made by [[urinating]] in snow (though this might not be characterized as the use of bodily fluids ''in'' art, just their use in preparation);
* performances by [[Lennie Lee]] involving feces, blood, vomit from 1990
* many paintings by [[Chris Ofili]], which make use of [[elephant]] [[Feces|dung]] (from 1992).
* [[Gilbert and George]]'s ''The Naked Shit Pictures'' (1995)
* [[Hermann Nitsch]] and Das Orgien Mysterien Theatre use urine, feces, blood and more in their ritual performances.
* [[Franko B]] from 1990 blood letting performances.
* The cover of the [[Metallica|Metallica's]] album [[Load (album)|Load]] is an original artwork entitled "Semen and Blood III", one of three photographic studies by [[Andres Serrano]] created in 1990 by mingling the artist's own [[semen]] and [[Bovinae|bovine]] [[blood]] between two sheets of [[Plexiglas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/usernet/awc/awc_workdetail.asp?aid=424202827&gid=424202827&cid=74183&wid=425106400&page=2 |title=Semen & Blood II |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-13}}</ref>

==Body fluids in forensic science==
The term '''body fluid''' is used in a forensic science context to refer to items of biological evidence. The term is a historical one whose meaning has been expanded due to the discovery of the evidential significance of various biological materials. Body fluid therefore refers to not only to typical body liquids such as blood or semen, but to any item of trace evidence with a biological origin, including hair, bone, teeth, faeces and skin or muscle tissue.

==References to Bodily Fluids in Popular Culture==
* In the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', [[Sterling Hayden]]'s character, General Jack D. Ripper, makes multiple references to 'bodily fluids' and his belief that they are being contaminated by communists via [[water fluoridation]].
