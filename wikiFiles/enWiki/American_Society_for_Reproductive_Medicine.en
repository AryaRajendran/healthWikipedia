==History and activities==
Founded in 1944 by a small group of fertility experts who met in Chicago, its initial name was the '''American Society for the Study of Sterility''' and then the '''American Fertility Society (AFS)'''. Though primarily an American organization, it now has members from over 100 countries worldwide.
Key activities are the Annual Meeting that brings together several thousand of interested professionals from different countries, as well as courses, seminars, workshops and publications. 
Special interest groups are focused on [[assisted reproductive technology]],  [[andrology]], [[reproductive surgery]], [[contraception]], [[menopause]], genetic counseling, business practices,  [[reproductive endocrinology]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], adolescent endocrinology, reproductive nursing, [[reproductive biology]], mental health, imaging techniques,  laboratory techniques, fertility preservation, and reproductive [[immunology]].
