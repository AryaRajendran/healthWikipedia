'''Wandering spleen''' (or '''Pelvic spleen''') is a rare medical [[disease]] caused by the loss or weakening of the [[ligaments]] that help to hold the [[spleen]].

==Background==

Wandering spleen is most commonly diagnosed in young [[children]]<ref name="PJMS">{{cite web | first=Malak | last=Hasan Alawi | coauthors=Ahmad Khalifa, Sami Hassan Bana | title=Wandering Spleen: A Challenging Diagnosis | format = PDF | publisher=Open Publishing | date=October-December 2005 | work=Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences | url=http://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/octdec05/pdf/wandering_spleen.pdf| accessdate=2007-02-25 }}</ref> as well as [[women]] between the ages of 20 and 40.<ref name="S">{{cite journal |author=Safioleas MC, Stamatakos MC, Diab AI, Safioleas PM |title=Wandering spleen with torsion of the pedicle |journal=Saudi Med J |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=135–6 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17206307 }}</ref> Even so, the disease is very rare and fewer than 500 occurrences of the disease have been reported as of 2005,<ref name="PJMS">{{cite web | first=Malak | last=Hasan Alawi | coauthors=Ahmad Khalifa, Sami Hassan Bana | title=Wandering Spleen: A Challenging Diagnosis | format = PDF | publisher=Open Publishing | date=October-December 2005 | work=Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences | url=http://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/octdec05/pdf/wandering_spleen.pdf| accessdate=2007-02-25 }}</ref> of which around 148 (including both children and adult cases) were documented to have been from between 1960 and 1992.<ref name="UK">{{cite journal | author=Satyadas T, Nasir N, Bradpiece HA | title=Wandering spleen: case report and literature review |journal=J.

Characteristics of the disorder include the loss, weakening, or malformation of the [[ligament]]s<ref name="NORD">{{cite web | title=Wandering Spleen | publisher=NORD | url=http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Wandering%20Spleen| accessdate=2007-02-25 }}</ref> that help to keep the spleen located in the upper left part of the [[abdomen]]. Though not a genetic disease, wandering spleen is often found at birth. It can occur in  [[adult]]s as the result of injuries and other similar conditions that cause the ligaments to weaken, such as [[connective tissue disease]] or [[pregnancy]].<ref name="NORD"/>

In 1992, the youngest case of the literature of torsion of wandering spleen at two days of birth was reported in Lebanon, by Dr Edouard Sayad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1339897 |title=Volvulus of a wandering spleen on the 2nd day after birth |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include an enlargement in the size of the spleen,<ref name="NORD"/> or a change from the spleen's original position to another location, usually in either other parts of the [[abdomen]] or into the pelvis. This ability to move to other locations is commonly attributed to the spleen's pedicle being abnormally long.<ref name="PJMS">{{cite web |first=Malak |last=Hasan Alawi |coauthors=Ahmad Khalifa, Sami Hassan Bana |title=Wandering Spleen: A Challenging Diagnosis |format=PDF |publisher=Open Publishing |date=October-December 2005 |work=Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences |url=http://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/octdec05/pdf/wandering_spleen.pdf |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

Physical factors may cause [[ischuria]], [[constipation]], as well as numerous spleen-related diseases such as [[hypersplenism]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[lymphoma]].<ref name="UK"/> Blocking of the arteries and [[Any Organ torsion refers to twisting that interrupts the blood supply to that organ ie., splenic torsion|torsion]] in the spleen can also result in abdominal pain or swelling.<ref name="Med">{{cite web |url=http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_vii/w/wandering_spleen.aspx |title= Wandering spleen |accessdate=2007-02-26 |format= |work= }}</ref> However, lack of visible [[symptom]]s &mdash; except in incidents of abdominal pain — makes the disease difficult for doctors to diagnose,<ref name="S"/> though [[medical imaging]] techniques such as [[medical ultrasonography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]], or [[computed tomography]] can be used to confirm its occurrence.

==Treatment==
The usual treatment is [[splenopexy]], [[fixation]] of the spleen, but if there is no blood flow after unwinding the spleen through [[detorsion]] then [[splenectomy]] must be performed.<ref name="S"/> Although there have been few reported cases of treatment through laparoscopic surgery due to the rarity of the disease, it has been proven to be an effective surgical technique.<ref name="C">{{cite journal |author=Castellón-Pavón CJ, Valderrábano-González S, Anchústegui-Melgarejo P, ''et al.'' |title=[Laparoscopic splenectomy due to torsion of a wandering spleen] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Cir Esp |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=406–8 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17192227 |url=http://www.elsevier.es/revistas/0009-739X/80/406}}</ref>

==In popular culture ==
[[Susan Mayer]] on the TV show [[Desperate Housewives]] had an operation to fix her wandering spleen in Season 2 of the show.
