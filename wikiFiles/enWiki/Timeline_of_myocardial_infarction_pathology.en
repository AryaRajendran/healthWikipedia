This table gives an overview of the '''[[pathology]] seen in [[myocardial infarction]]''' by time after obstruction.

For the first ~30 minutes no change at all can be seen by [[gross examination]] or by light microscopy in [[histopathology]]. However, in [[electron microscopy]] relaxed myofibrils, as well as glycogen loss and mitochondrial swelling can be seen.

Once scarring is completed, there is yet no common method of telling the actual age of the infarct, since e.g. a scar that is four months old looks identical to a scar that is ten years old.
