'''Chromosome 12''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 12 spans about 143 million [[base pair]]s (the building material of [[DNA]]) and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]].

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 12 likely contains between 1,000 and 1,300 genes. It also contains the [[Homeobox]] C gene cluster.

== Genes ==
The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 12:
* [[ACVRL1]]: activin A receptor type II-like 1
* [[heterochromatin protein 1|CBX5]]: chromobox homolog 5
* [[COL2A1]]: collagen, type II, alpha 1 (primary osteoarthritis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, congenital)
* [[HPD (gene)|HPD]]: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
* [[KCNA1]]: potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1 at 12p13.32
* [[KERA (gene)|KERA]]: keratocan
* [[LRRK2]]: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
* [[MMAB]]: methylmalonic aciduria (cobalamin dewrong ficiency) cblB type
* [[MYO1A]]: myosin IA
* [[Nanog (transcription factor)|NANOG]]: NK-2 type homeodomain gene
* [[PAH (gene)|PAH]]: phenylalanine hydroxylase
* [[PPP1R12A]]: protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subungfdit 12A
* [[PTPN11]]: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (Noonan syndrome 1)
* [[KRAS]]: V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
