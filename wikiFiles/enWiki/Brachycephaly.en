In people, '''brachycephaly''', also known as '''flat head syndrome''', is a type of [[cephalic disorder]]. It is a normal variation in some domesticated dog and cat breeds, and can be normal or abnormal in other animal species. In humans, the disorder results from premature fusion of the coronal sutures (see [[craniosynostosis]]) or from external deformation (see [[plagiocephaly]]).  The coronal suture is the fibrous joint that unites the [[frontal bone]] with the two [[parietal bone]]s of the skull. The parietal bones form the top and sides of the skull.  This feature can be seen in [[Down syndrome]].

The incidence of brachycephaly has increased dramatically since the advent of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] recommendations for parents to keep their babies on their backs.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=PEDIATRICS|title=Prevention and Management of Positional Skull Deformities in Infants|volume=112|number=1 |date=1 July 2003 |pages=199â€“202|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/1/199.full|author=John Persing et al}}</ref> It is considered just a cosmetic problem.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (flat head syndrome)|work=NHS|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Plagiocephaly/Pages/Introduction.aspx |date=13 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Case-Control Study of Neurodevelopment in Deformational Plagiocephaly|author=Matthew L.

There are also cases of brachycephaly associated with [[plagiocephaly]], this deformity occurs when there is a combination of brachycephaly and [[plagiocephaly]] present. Brachycephaly with [[plagiocephaly]] is positional and has become more prevalent since the "Back to Sleep" Campaign.The Back to Sleep campaign began in 1994 as a way to educate parents, caregivers, and health care providers about ways to reduce the risk for [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS). The campaign was named for its recommendation to place healthy babies on their backs to sleep. Placing babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk for SIDS, also known as "crib death." This campaign has been successful in promoting infant back sleeping and other risk-reduction strategies to parents, family members, child care providers, health professionals, and all other caregivers of infants, at a cost of increasing the incidence of this deformation of the head.

Brachycephaly also describes a developmentally normal type of skull with a high [[cephalic index]], such as in snub-nosed breeds of dog such [[pug]]s and [[bulldog]]s or cats such as the [[Persian (cat)|Persian]], [[Exotic Shorthair|Exotic]] and [[Himalayan_(cat)|Himalayan]]. 

==Custom in China==
Flattened occiputs are considered more beautiful and a sign of luck among the elderly in some parts of China. Parents who follow this custom will rest their infants' heads on hard plates or hard pillows (filled with rice, for example) to flatten the occiputs. However, more recently, parents in China have considered rounded heads to be more beautiful and have abandoned the custom.

==Treatment==

Brachycephaly can be corrected with a cranial remolding orthoses (helmet)<ref>http://www.craniokidz.com/</ref> which provide painless total contact over the prominent areas of the skull and leave voids over the flattened areas to provide a pathway for more symmetrical skull growth. Treatment generally takes 3-4 months, but varies depending on the infant's age and severity of the cranial asymmetry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flat Head Syndrome treatment helmet|url=http://steeperclinic.com/starband/what_is_starband|publisher=RSLSteeper}}</ref>
