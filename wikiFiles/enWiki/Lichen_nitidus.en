==Pathology==
The [[histology]] of lichen nitidus is significant for a "...localized [[granulomatous]] lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in an expanded [[dermal papilla]] with thinning of overlying epidermis and downward extension of the [[rete]] ridges at the lateral margin of the infiltrate, producing a typical 'claw clutching a ball' picture...."<ref name="Mutairi" />

==Treatment==
Generally, lichen nitidus is asymptomatic and self-limited; therefore, no treatment is required.  However, if persistent pruritus is present, or the appearance “...interferes with daily activities or outlook...”<ref name="Andrews" /> topical [[glucocorticoids]] may be tried.  If the disease process is symptomatic, generalized and extensive, oral glucocorticoids may be indicated.<ref name="Andrews" />  Other reported treatments include PUVA, UVA/UVB phototherapy,<ref name="Do" /> [[astemizole]],<ref name="Mutairi" /> [[acitretin]], and [[etretinate]].<ref name="Andrews" />
When appears with sun/humidity; air conditioning (cool dry air) reduces swelling and discomfort/discomfort.
