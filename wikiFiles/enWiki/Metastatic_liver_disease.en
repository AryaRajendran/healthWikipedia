A '''liver metastasis''' is a malignant tumor in the liver that has spread from another organ affected by cancer. The [[liver]] is a common site for metastatic disease because it is rich, dual blood supply (the liver receives blood via the hepatic artery and portal vein), which is 20 times more common than primary ones. In 50% of all cases of primary tumor is [[gastrointestinal tract]], other common sites include the [[breast]], [[ovaries]], [[bronchus]] and [[kidney]].

Tumor [[emboli]] entering the [[sinusoids]] through the liver blood supply appear to be physically obstructed by the [[Kupffer cells]], but if tumor [[emboli]] are larger, they tend to become lodged in the portal venous branches.

== Features ==

* [[Hepatomegaly]]
* [[Tenderness]]
* Cachexic
* [[Ascites]]
* [[Jaundice]]
* [[Pyrexia]]- up to 10% of patients
* [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] and gamma glutamyl trandspeptidase elevated
* [[Ultrasound scan]] and [[CT scan]] - multiple filling defects

== Diagnosis ==

* [[Hemoglobin]] decrease
* [[Liver function test]]: [[Alkaline phosphatase|ALP]] elevated, [[bilirubin]] elevated, [[albumin]] decrease
* [[Carcinoembryonic antigen]] for [[colorectal]] secondaries
* [[Ultrasound scan]]
* [[CT scan]]
* [[Biopsy]] under [[ultrasound]] control

== Treatment ==
For most patients no effective treatment exists --- because both lobes usually involved --- making [[Segmental resection|surgical resection]] impossible. Younger patients with [[metastases]] from [[colorectal cancer]], confined to one lobe of liver and up to 4 in number, may be treated by partial [[hepatectomy]]. In selected cases, [[chemotherapy]] may be given systematically or via hepatic artery.

In some tumors, notably arising from the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[rectum]], apparently solitary [[metastases]]/[[metastases]] to one or other lobes --- may be resected. Careful search for other [[metastases]] is required, including local recurrence of original primary tumor (e.g.:[[colonoscopy]]) and dissemination elsewhere (e.g.:CT of [[thorax]]) --- 5 year survival rates of 30-40% have been reported following resection
