'''Sex after pregnancy''' is often delayed for several weeks or months, and may be difficult and painful for women. Injury to the [[perineum]] or surgical cuts ([[episiotomy]]) to the [[vagina]] during [[childbirth]] can cause [[sexual dysfunction]]. Sexual activity other than [[sexual intercourse]] is possible sooner, but some women experience a prolonged loss of sexual desire after giving birth, which may be associated with [[postnatal depression]]. Common issues that may last more than a year after birth are greater desire by the man than the woman, and a worsening of the woman's body image.<ref name=pastore>{{cite journal|last=Pastore|first=L|coauthors=Owens A, Raymond C|year=2007|title=Postpartum sexuality concerns among first-time parents from one U.S. academic hospital|journal=J Sex Med|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell/International Society for Sexual Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=115–23|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118496050/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00379.x|pmid=17087807}}</ref><ref name=olsson>{{cite journal|last=Olsson|first=Ann|coauthors=Martina Lundqvist, Elisabeth Faxelid, and Eva Nissen|year=2005|title=Women's thoughts about sexual life after childbirth: focus group discussions with women after childbirth|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell/Nordic College of Caring Science|volume=19|issue=4|pages=381–7|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118652876/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6712.2005.00357.x|pmid=16324063}}</ref>
