'''International Society on Toxinology (IST)''' is a global society of scientists and clinicians working for the advancement of [[venoms]], [[poisons]] and [[toxins]]. It was founded in 1962 with an aim to advance knowledge on venoms, poisons and toxins of [[animal]], [[plant]] and [[microorganisms|microbial]] origin.<ref name=meb>{{cite journal |author= Mebs D|title= History of the International Society on Toxinology - A personal view| journal= Toxicon|year=2012| volume=in press|issue= |pages= |pmid= 23237723|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.11.021}}</ref>

==Origin==

===Pioneer research===
{{Main| Francesco Redi}}
In 1664 an Italian polymath [[Francesco Redi]] wrote his first monumental work ''Osservazioni intorno alle vipere'' (Observations about the Viper) in which he first elucidated the scientific basis of [[snakebite]] and venom of the viper.<ref>{{cite book |author= Francesco Redi |editor=Knoefel PK  |title= Francesco Redi on Vipers |url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5w8VAAAAIAAJ&pg|accessdate= 2013-04-18 |origyear=   |year= 1988  |publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden, the Netherlands  |pages=11–17 |isbn= 9004089489}}</ref> He showed that the venom is produced from the [[fang]], it is not poisonous when swallowed, and dangerous only when it enters the  [[blood circulation|bloodstream]].<ref name=hab>{{cite journal |author= Habermehl GG|title= Francesco Redi—life and work|url= |year= 1994 |volume=32  |issue=4  |pages=411–417|pmid=8052995 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90292-5}}</ref> He even showed how to stop or slow down the venom action in the blood by tight [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of [[toxinology]] and the beginning of experimental [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hayes AN, Gilbert SG|title= Historical milestones and discoveries that shaped the toxicology sciences| journal= EXS|year=2009| volume=99 |issue=1 |pages= 1–35|pmid= 19157056}}</ref>

===Foundation===

In 1962 a group of scientists and clinicians who have made significant contributions to toxinology joined forces to establish a working society. The Society had it's first international meeting in 1966 in [[Atlantic City]], USA. [[Findlay E. Russell]] was the first president of the Society.<ref name=meb/><ref>{{cite journal |author= Russell FE|title= History of the International Society on Toxinology and Toxicon. I. The formative years, 1954–1965| journal= Toxicon|year=1987| volume=25|issue=1 |pages=3–21 |pmid= 3551198|doi=}}</ref>

==Organisation and Membership==

The Society aims to advance knowledge on the properties of toxins and antitoxins and to bring together scholars interested in the field. Full membership is open to those who have published meritorious [[original research|original investigations]] in toxinology, while persons who do not qualify for membership but are interested in the field of toxinology are eligible for associate membership. There is also student membership. World Congresses of the Society and Symposia of the IST-Sections (European, Pan-American, Asia-Pacific) are regularly organised to promote communication and exchange of results in toxinology research. The officers of the Society, the President and Secretary-Treasurer, are assisted by a Council and they all are elected by the members.<ref name=meb/>

==Award==
{{Main|Redi Award}}
IST sponsors the ''[[Redi Award]]'' to honour scientists who have contributed distinguished work in the field of toxinology. This is the most prestigious award in the world in toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of IST (generally held every three years) since 1967.<ref name=hab /><ref>{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title=IST Redi Awards |url= http://www.toxinology.org/IST_RediAward.htm |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>

==Initiative==

At the Asia-Pacific Section Congress in [[Vietnam]] in December 2008, a proposal by Prof David Warrell (recipient of the Redi Award 2012) that ''The Global Snakebite Initiative be formally endorsed as an official initiative of the IST'' was passed, and confirmed unanimously at the IST World Congress in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], in March 2009. The Global Snakebite Initiative is the follow-up of the [[World Health Organization]] programme on snakebite as one of the [[Neglected Tropical Diseases]].<ref>{{cite web |author= WHO |title= Neglected tropical diseases: Snakebite |url= http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/snakebites/en/ |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>

==Publication==

''[[Toxicon]]'' is the official journal of the Society, started in 1963, and is now published monthly by [[Elsevier]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Rosenberg P|title= Happy 25th birthday ''Toxicon''| journal= Toxicon|year=1987| volume=25|issue=1 |pages=1–2 |pmid= |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(87)90147-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= NCBI NLM Catalogue |title= Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology|url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/1307333|date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>
