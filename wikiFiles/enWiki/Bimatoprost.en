'''Bimatoprost''' (marketed in the U.S., Canada and Europe by [[Allergan]], under the trade name '''Lumigan''') is a [[prostaglandin]] analog/prodrug used topically (as [[eye drop]]s) to control the progression of [[glaucoma]] and in the management of [[ocular hypertension]].  It reduces [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) by increasing the outflow of [[aqueous humor|aqueous fluid]] from the eyes.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a602030.html | title = Bimatoprost Ophthalmic | publisher = [[MedlinePlus]] | date = January 1, 2003 | accessdate = 2007-11-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071005013222/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a602030.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> It has also been used and prescribed [[off-label use|off-label]] to lengthen [[eyelash]]es.<ref name="WSJ-19-11-2007">{{cite news | title=Drug That Lengthens Eyelashes Sets Off Flutter | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119543055372597359.html | date=2007-11-19 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate=2007-11-19 | first=Rhonda L. | last=Rundle}}</ref> In December 2008, this use was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA); the cosmetic formulation of bimatoprost is sold as '''Latisse''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|l|ə|ˈ|t|iː|s}}).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D95AF4N81.htm |title=Allergan gets FDA approval for eyelash treatment |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=December 26, 2008 |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> In 2008-2011, at least three case series suggested that bimatoprost has the ability to reduce adipose (fat) tissue.<ref name=JapaneseOphSociety>{{cite journal | author = Park J, Cho HK, Moon JI | title = Changes to upper eyelid orbital fat from use of topical bimatoprost, travoprost, and latanoprost. | journal = Japanese Ophthalmological Society | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–27 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21331688 | doi = 10.1007/s10384-010-0904-z}}</ref><ref name=Orbit>{{cite journal | author = Jayaprakasam A, Ghazi-Nouri S. | title = Periorbital fat atrophy - an unfamiliar side effect of prostaglandin analogues.  | journal = Orbit | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 357–359 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21158579 | doi = 10.3109/01676830.2010.527028}}</ref><ref name=OphthPlasReconSurg>{{cite journal | author = Filippopoulos T, Paula JS, Torun N, Hatton MP, Pasquale LR, Grosskreutz CL. | title = Periorbital changes associated with topical bimatoprost. | journal = Ophthalmology Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 302–307 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18645437 | doi = 10.1097/IOP.0b013e31817d81df}}</ref>

==Cosmetic use==
In patients using ophthalmic prostaglandins such as [[travoprost]] and [[latanoprost]], it has been anecdotally noted{{by whom|date=December 2011}} that there had been an increase in diameter, density and length of eyelashes. Allergan has initiated{{when|date=December 2011}} clinical trials investigating the usage of Lumigan as a cosmetic drug.<ref name=WSJ-19-11-2007/> On December 5, 2008, the FDA Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to approve bimatoprost for the cosmetic use of darkening and lengthening eyelashes.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The medical term for this is treatment of hypotrichosis, however, the FDA approval is for purely cosmetic purposes.<ref name=ThePinkSheet15Dec2008>The Pink Sheet: [http://www.thepinksheet.com] Lauren Smith December 15, 2008; Volume 70, Number 050,Page {{verify source|date=December 2011}}</ref>

For cosmetic purposes, it is administered once daily by applying the solution to the skin at the base of the eyelash using an applicator device [https://www.mylash.org/about/frequently-asked-questions/applying-mylash/ "Application Guide"], where it has its effect upon the hair follicle.

Bimatoprost activates prostamide alpha F2 receptors found in the hair follicle to stimulate its growth rate. Research led by Professor Randall and the University of Bradford found that it may also offer a treatment for scalp hair regrowth in trials conducted on samples taken from men undergoing hair transplants.<ref name=Reuters-26-10-2012>Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal [http://www.fasebj.org/content/early/2012/10/25/fj.12-218156.full.pdf+html?sid=4d11e6b1-957d-49e8-8e58-31981ac3247b "The prostamide-related glaucoma therapy, bimatoprost, offers a novel approach for treating scalp alopecias"] Randall et all. October 26, 2012.</ref>

According to Allergan's package labeling, users of its Latisse cosmetic product didn't develop darker irises in clinical studies; however, "patients should be advised about the potential for increased brown iris pigmentation which is likely to be permanent."<ref name=Label>Latisse prescribing information: [http://www.latisse.com/Professional/?show=prescribingInfo "Important Safety Information"]</ref>

Several cosmetics companies have released products based on prostaglandin analogs, as non-drug cosmetics.
* Age Intervention Eyelash by Jan Marini Skin Research
* RevitaLash by Athena Cosmetics Corp.
These companies have been sued by Allergan for patent infringement.<ref name=WSJ-19-11-2007/> The FDA has seized Age Intervention Eyelash as an "unapproved and misbranded drug" because Jan Marini Skin Research promoted it as something that increases eyelash growth<ref name=MSNBC-17-11-2007>MSNBC: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21842238/ FDA Seizes $2 Million Of Potentially Harmful SJ Eye Product] KNTV-TV November 17, 2007 {{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> and because it is "adulterated" with bimatoprost.<ref name=Reuters-16-11-2007>Reuters: [http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1642077420071117 "U.S. seizes discontinued eyelash product"]. Jim Wolf. November 16, 2007.</ref>

==Fat-reducing properties==
Reductions in orbital fat (i.e., fat around the eye) have been observed in patients using bimatoprost as glaucoma therapy.<ref name=PubMed>{{cite journal |author=Tappeiner C, Perren B, Iliev ME, Frueh BE, Goldblum D |title=Orbitale Fettgewebsatrophie bei lokaler Bimatoprost-Therapie - Kann Bimatoprost einen Enophthalmus verursachen? |trans_title=Orbital fat atrophy in glaucoma patients treated with topical bimatoprost--can bimatoprost cause enophthalmos? |language=German |journal=Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde |volume=225 |issue=5 |pages=443–5 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18454393 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1027362}}</ref> Of particular interest, the loss of orbital fat was unilateral in patients who used bimatoprost on only one eye.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filippopoulos T, Paula JS, Torun N, Hatton MP, Pasquale LR, Grosskreutz CL |title=Periorbital changes associated with topical bimatoprost |journal=Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=302–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18645437 |doi=10.1097/IOP.0b013e31817d81df}}</ref> The effect appears reversible upon cessation of bimatoprost use.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The effect is likely to explain deepening of the lid sulcus described in a series of three patients on bimatoprost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peplinski LS, Albiani Smith K |title=Deepening of lid sulcus from topical bimatoprost therapy |journal=Optometry and Vision Science |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=574–7 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15300114 |doi=10.1097/01.opx.0000141791.16683.4a}}</ref> The mechanism for the apparent fat reduction remains unclear. However, bimatoprost is chemically analogous to [[Prostaglandin F2alpha|prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub>]] (PGF<sub>2α</sub>), a compound which is known to reduce fat by inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Serrero G, Lepak NM |title=Prostaglandin F2alpha receptor (FP receptor) agonists are potent adipose differentiation inhibitors for primary culture of adipocyte precursors in defined medium |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=233 |issue=1 |pages=200–2 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9144422 |doi=10.1006/bbrc.1997.6433}}</ref>

==Formulations==
Lumigan is a 0.03% solution of bimatoprost, and contains [[benzalkonium chloride]] as a preservative. [[Contact lens]]es should therefore be removed before use, and replaced no less than 15 minutes later;<ref name=MedlinePlus/> other eye drops or ointments should be given no less than five minutes before or after bimatoprost.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

==Efficacy==
Studies have shown once-daily bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution to be more effective than [[timolol]] twice daily in reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) and as effective as or more effective than the prostaglandin analogues [[latanoprost]] and [[travoprost]] in reducing IOP.<ref name="pmid19929032">{{cite journal| author=Curran MP| title=Bimatoprost: a review of its use in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension | journal=Drugs Aging | year= 2009 | volume= 26 | issue= 12 | pages= 1049–71 | pmid=19929032 | doi=10.2165/11203210-000000000-00000 }}</ref>

==Side effects==
Possible side effects of this medication are:{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* May cause blurred vision.
* May cause eyelid redness.
* May permanently darken eyelashes.
* May cause eye discomfort.
* May eventually cause permanent darkening of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] to brown.
* May cause a temporary burning sensation during use.
* May cause thickening of the eyelashes.
* It may cause unexpected growth of hair if applied inappropriately, on the cheek, for example.
* It may cause infection if the one-time applicators which come with the genuine product are reused.
* Lashes may grow so long that they become ingrown and scratch the cornea.
* May cause darkening of the eyelid or of the area beneath the eye.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/health/02latisse.html "Long Lashes Without Prescription, but With Risks"]. Catherine Saint Louis. ''[[The New York Times]]. May 1, 2010</ref>

On November 19, 2007, the FDA issued a warning during the seizure of a bimatoprost-containing cosmetic.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/cosmeticeye111907.html | title = Potentially Harmful "Cosmetic" Eye Product Seized | date = November 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-12-05 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) }}</ref> The warning stated that "the extra dose of bimatoprost may decrease the prescription drug's effectiveness. Damage to the optic nerve may lead to decreased vision and possibly blindness."
