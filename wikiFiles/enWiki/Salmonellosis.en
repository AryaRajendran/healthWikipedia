'''Salmonellosis''' is an [[infection]] with ''[[Salmonella]]'' [[bacteria]]. Most people infected with ''Salmonella'' develop [[diarrhea]], [[fever]], [[vomiting]], and [[abdominal pain|abdominal cramps]] 12 to 72 hours after infection. In most cases, the illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.<ref>http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/salmonella_questions_&_answers/index.asp#3</ref> In some cases, though, the diarrhea may be so severe, the patient becomes dangerously [[dehydration|dehydrated]] and must be [[hospital]]ized. 

At the hospital, the patient may receive [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid]]s to treat the dehydration, and may be given [[medication]]s to provide [[symptom]]atic relief, such as fever reduction. In severe cases, the ''Salmonella'' infection may spread from the [[intestine]]s to the [[blood]] stream, and then to other body sites, and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with [[antibiotic]]s. 

The elderly, infants, and those with impaired [[immune system]]s are more likely to develop severe illness. Some people afflicted with salmonellosis later experience [[reactive arthritis]], which can have long-lasting, disabling effects. The different kinds of ''Salmonella'' include ''S. bongori'' and ''S. enterica''. 

The type of ''Salmonella'' usually associated with infections in humans, '''nontyphoidal ''Salmonella''''', is usually contracted from sources such as:

* [[Poultry]], [[pork]], and [[beef]], if the meat is prepared incorrectly or is infected with the bacteria after preparation<ref name="FDA-Salmonella">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/a2z-s.html |title= FDA/CFSAN - Food Safety A to Z Reference Guide - Salmonella |work=FDA - Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2009-02-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
* Infected [[Egg (food)|eggs]], egg products, and [[milk]]  when not prepared, handled, or refrigerated properly<ref name="FDA-Salmonella"/>
* [[Reptile]]s, such as [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[snake]]s, which may carry the bacteria in their intestines
* Tainted fruits and vegetables<ref name="FDA-Salmonella"/>

The typhoidal form of ''Salmonella'' can lead to [[typhoid fever]]. Typhoid fever is a life-threatening illness, and about 400 cases are reported each year in the United States, and 75% of these are acquired while traveling out of the country. It is carried only by humans and is usually contracted through direct contact with the [[feces|fecal matter]] of an infected person. Typhoidal ''Salmonella'' is more commonly found in poorer countries, where unsanitary conditions are more likely to occur, and can affect as many as 21.5&nbsp;million persons each year.

== Epidemiology ==
Both salmonellosis and the ''Salmonella'' genus of microorganisms derive their names from a modern Latin coining after [[Daniel E. Salmon]] (1850–1914), an American veterinary surgeon. He had help from [[Theobald Smith]], and together they found the bacterium in pigs.

== Symptoms ==
The bacterium induces responses in the animal it is infecting, and this typically causes the [[symptom]]s, rather than any direct [[toxin]] produced.<ref name=McGhie_2009>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.mib.2008.12.001 |author= McGhie EJ, Brawn LC, Hume PJ, Humphreys D, Koronakis V |title=Salmonella takes control: effector-driven manipulation of the host |journal=Curr Opin Microbiol |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=117–24 |year=2009 |pmid=19157959 |pmc= 2647982}}</ref> Symptoms are usually [[gastrointestinal]], including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], abdominal cramps, and bloody [[diarrhea]] with [[mucus]]. [[Headache]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], and [[rose spots]] are also possible. These symptoms can be severe, especially in young children and the elderly. Symptoms last generally up to a week, and can appear 12 to 72 hours after ingesting the [[bacteria|bacterium]].

After bacterial infections, [[reactive arthritis]] (Reiters syndrome) can develop.<ref name=Dworkin_2001>{{cite journal |author= Dworkin MS, Shoemaker PC, Goldoft MJ, Kobayashi JM |title=Reactive arthritis and Reiter's syndrome following an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella enteritidis |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1010–14 |year=2001 |pmid=11528573 |doi= 10.1086/322644}}</ref> In [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]], [[osteomyelitis]] due to ''Salmonella'' infection is much more common than in the general population.  Though ''Salmonella'' infection is frequently the cause of osteomyelitis in sickle-cell anemia patients, it is not the most common cause; the most common cause remains ''Staphylococcus'' infection.

== Pathogenesis ==
An infectious process can only begin after living salmonellae (not only their toxins) reach the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  Some of the [[microorganism]]s are killed in the stomach, while the surviving salmonellae enter the small intestine and multiply in tissues (localized form). By the end of the [[incubation period]], the macro-organisms are poisoned by [[endotoxin]]s released from the dead salmonellae. The local response to the endotoxins is [[enteritis]] and gastrointestinal disorder. In the generalized form of the disease, salmonellae pass through the [[lymphatic system]] of the intestine into the blood of the patients (typhoid form) and are carried to various organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) to form secondary foci (septic form). Endotoxins first act on affected organs' vascular and nervous systems, manifested by increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset thermal regulation, vomiting and diarrhea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and [[electrolyte]]s are lost to upset the body's water-salt metabolism, to decrease the circulating blood volume and [[arterial pressure]], and to cause [[hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]]. [[Septic shock]] also may develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) is more common in severe salmonellosis. [[Oliguria]] and [[azotemia]] develop in severe cases as a result of renal (kidney) involvement due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[bacteremia]].<ref name=ml>{{cite book|last=Volovskaya|first=ML|title=Epidemiology and Fundamentals of Infectious Diseases|publisher=Mir Publishers Moscow|isbn=5-03-001548-5|pages=91–96}}</ref>

== Incidence ==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=April 2009}}
About 142,000 Americans are infected each year with ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica|Salmonella]]'' [[Salmonella enterica enterica|Enteritidis]] from [[chicken eggs]], and about 30 die.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Administration Urged to Boost Food Safety Efforts |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/07/AR2009070702343.html?hpid=topnews |quote=Among them is a final rule, issued by the FDA, to reduce the contamination in eggs.

=== Up to 2005 ===
The U.S. Government reported as many as 20% of all chickens were contaminated with ''Salmonella'' in the late 1990s, and 16.3% were contaminated in 2005.<ref>{{cite news | first =  Marian | last = Burros | title = More Salmonella Is Reported in Chickens | publisher = The New York Times | date = March 8, 2006 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/dining/08well.html?ex=1179288000&en=1f7944fcd0d6fc64&ei=5070 | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>  In the mid- to late 20th century, ''Salmonella enterica'' serovar Enteritidis was a common contaminant of eggs. This is much less common now with the advent of hygiene measures in egg production, and the vaccination of laying hens to prevent ''Salmonella'' colonization. Various ''Salmonella'' [[serovar]]s (strains) also cause severe diseases in animals.

=== 2006 ===
In June 2006, the [[BBC]] reported the [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] chocolate manufacturer withdrew a number of products  contaminated with ''Salmonella'', which had resulted in up to 56 cases of salmonellosis.<ref name=Guardian_2006>{{cite news | title = Cadbury named over salmonella outbreak | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/Story/0,,1826262,00.html | publisher = Guardian Unlimited | date =  2006-07-21 | accessdate = 2007-09-09 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Tran}}</ref> The causes had been traced to a leaking pipe at a Cadbury plant in [[Herefordshire]] in January 2006, though the announcement was not made until June.

=== 2007 ===
In February 2007, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning to consumers not to eat certain jars of [[Peter Pan (peanut butter)|Peter Pan]] or Great Value peanut butter, due to risk of contamination with ''Salmonella'' Tennessee.[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01563.html]

In March 2007, around 150 people were diagnosed with salmonellosis after eating tainted food at a governor's reception in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Over 1,500 people attended the ball on March 1, and fell ill as a consequence of ingesting salmonella-tainted sandwiches.

About 150 people were sickened by salmonella-tainted chocolate cake produced by a major bakery chain in Singapore in December 2007.[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/316110/1/.html]

=== 2008 ===
{{Main|2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak}}
From April 10, 2008 to July 8, 2008, the rare Saintpaul [[serovar|serotype]] of ''S. enteritidis'' caused at least 1017 cases of salmonellosis food poisoning in 41 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. As of July 2008, the U.S. FDA suspected the contaminated food product was a common ingredient in fresh salsa, such as raw [[tomato]], fresh [[jalapeño|jalapeño pepper]], fresh [[serrano pepper]], and fresh [[coriander|cilantro]]. It is the largest reported salmonellosis outbreak in the United States since 1985. New Mexico and Texas have been proportionally the hardest hit by far, with 49.7 and 16.1 reported cases per million, respectively. The greatest number of reported cases have occurred in Texas (384), New Mexico (98), Illinois (100), and Arizona (49).<ref>{{cite news | title = Cases infected with the outbreak strain of ''Salmonella'' Saintpaul, United States, by state | url = http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/saintpaul/map.html}} For some states, such as California, the CDC has recently revised the tally of identified illness downward.</ref> At least 203 reported hospitalizations have been linked to the outbreak, it has caused at least one death, and it may have been a contributing factor in at least one additional death.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/saintpaul/ August 8, 2008: Investigation of Outbreak of Infections Caused by ''Salmonella'' Saintpaul | Salmonella CDC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] maintains "it is likely many more illnesses have occurred than those reported."

{{Main|Peanut Corporation of America}}

On January 17, 2009, the FDA announced they had traced the source of an outbreak of ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica|Salmonella]]'' [[Salmonella enterica enterica|Typhimurium]] to a plant in [[Blakely, Georgia]], owned by [[Peanut Corporation of America]] (PCA), and urged people to postpone eating commercially prepared or manufactured peanut butter-containing products and institutionally served peanut butter.<ref name="fda-hottopic">[http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/salmonellatyph.html Recall of Products Containing Peanut Butter: ''Salmonella'' Typhimurium], [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].</ref>  ''Salmonella'' was reported to be found in 46 states in the United States in at least 3,862 peanut butter-based products, such as crackers, energy bars, and peanut butter cookies from at least 343 food companies.  Dog treats were affected, as well.  At least 691 people in more than 46 states became sick, and the ''Salmonella'' claimed at least 9 lives as of March 25.<ref name="fdaupdate">[http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/salmonellatyph.html Recall of Peanut-Containing Products: ''Salmonella Typhimurium'' (Current Update)], U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ref><ref name="cdcupdate">[http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/typhimurium/update.html Investigation Update: Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium Infections, 2008–2009], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE50F7GH20090119 | work=Reuters | title=More peanut products recalled, U.S. probe continues | date=2009-01-19}}</ref><ref>MSNBC: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28749159</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/health/27peanuts.html?ref=health | work=The New York Times | title=Peanut Plant Had History of Health Lapses | date=2009-01-27 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>

Peanut butter and peanut paste manufactured by PCA were distributed to hundreds of firms for use as an ingredient in thousands of different products, such as cookies, crackers, cereal, candy and ice cream, all of which were recalled. Some products were also sold directly to consumers in retail outlets, such as dollar stores.<ref name="fda-hottopic"/>

On March 14, 2009, expressing his own personal concern for the safety of his children who enjoy peanut butter, President Obama announced the establishment of the Food Safety Working Group, "an inter-agency effort to help overhaul the oversight system." <ref>{{cite journal

The announcement came days after the FDA, also responding, released its first "guidance" on dealing with ''Salmonella'' contamination.

=== 2012 ===
An outbreak of salmonellosis caused by a rarer subspecies, ''Salmonella'' Bareilly, was reported in multiple states mostly in the East, having yet caused no deaths, but many episodes of sickness and some hospitalizations has been linked to the consumption of raw scraped ground tuna product.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/bareilly-04-12/index.html] "Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Bareilly Infections Associated with a Raw Scraped Ground Tuna Product"</ref>

Since July 2012, an outbreak of salmonellosis occurred in [[Northern Europe]] caused by ''Salmonella'' Thompson. The infections were linked to [[smoked salmon]] from the manufacterer Foppen, where the contamination had occurred. Most infections were reported in the [[Netherlands]], over 1060 infections with this subspecies have been confirmed, as well as four mortalities.<ref>''Veelgestelde vragen  Salmonella Thompson 15 oktober 2012, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu'' [Frequently asked questions Salmonella Thompson 15 October 2012, Netherlands Institute for Public Health and the Environment].</ref> <ref> "Salmonella besmetting neemt verder af, 2 november 2012, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu" [Salmonella infections continue to decline 2 November 2012, Netherlands Institute for Public Healthand the Environment].</ref>{{See also|2012 salmonella outbreak}}

== Four-Inch Regulation ==
The "Four-Inch Regulation" or "Four-Inch Law" is a colloquial name for a regulation issued by the U.S. FDA in 1975, restricting the sale of turtles with a [[carapace]] length of less than four inches (10 cm).<ref>{{cite web | title = Human Health Hazards Associated with Turtles | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration |  url = http://www.fda.gov/cvm/turtlereg.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609071736/http://www.fda.gov/cvm/turtlereg.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-09}}</ref>

The regulation was promulgated, according to the FDA, "because of the public health impact of turtle-associated salmonellosis." There had been reported cases of young children placing small turtles in their mouths, which led to the size-based restriction.

== Prevention ==
{{See also|Critical control point}}
The FDA has published guidelines<ref>{{cite web

|date= 2006-09-20}}</ref> to help reduce the chance of food-borne salmonellosis.  Food must be cooked to 68–72°C (145–160°F), and liquids such as soups or gravies must be boiled.  Freezing kills some ''Salmonella'', but it is not sufficient to reliably reduce them below infectious levels.  While ''Salmonella'' is usually heat-sensitive, it does acquire heat resistance in high-fat environments such as peanut butter.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE5296H420090310 | work=Reuters | title=FDA issues peanut safety guidelines for foodmakers | date=2009-03-10}}</ref>

== Antibodies and vaccine development ==
''Salmonella'' antibodies were first found in [[Malawi]] children in research published in 2008. The Malawian researchers have identified an antibody that protects children against bacterial infections of the blood caused by ''Salmonella''. A study <!---of 3529651065 children ---> at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]] found that children up to two years old develop antibodies that aid in killing the bacteria. This could lead to a possible ''Salmonella'' vaccine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacLennan CA, Gondwe EN, Msefula CL, ''et al.'' |title=The neglected role of antibody in protection against bacteremia caused by nontyphoidal strains of Salmonella in African children|journal=J.
