'''Malabsorption''' is a state arising from abnormality in [[absorption (small intestine)|absorption]] of [[Nutrient|food nutrients]] across the [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal (GI) tract]].

Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. This may lead to [[malnutrition]] and a variety of [[anemia|anaemias]].<ref>{{cite web | last =  Jensen | first = Jonathan E  |title=Malabsorption Syndromes - Page 1| publisher =Colorado center for digestive disorders|url=http://www.gastromd.com/education/malabsorptionsyndromes.html  |accessdate=2007-05-10 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070411100726/http://www.gastromd.com/education/malabsorptionsyndromes.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-11}}</ref>

==Classification==
Some prefer to classify malabsorption clinically into three basic categories:<ref>Gasbarrini G,  Frisono M: Critical evaluation of malabsorption tests; in {{cite book |author=G. Dobrilla, G. Bertaccini, G. Langman (Editor) |title=Problems and Controversies in Gastroenterology |publisher=Raven Pr |location= New York |year= 1986 |pages=  123–130|isbn=88-85037-75-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>
:(1) '''selective''', as seen in lactose malabsorption.
:(2) '''partial''', as observed in a-Beta-lipoproteinaemia.
:(3) '''total''' as in [[coeliac disease]].

==Pathophysiology==
The main purpose of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is to [[digestion|digest]] and [[absorption (small intestine)|absorb]] nutrients ([[fat]], [[carbohydrate]], [[protein]], and [[fiber]]), micronutrients ([[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral|trace minerals]]), water, and [[electrolytes]]. [[Digestion]] involves both mechanical and [[enzyme|enzymatic]] breakdown of food. '''Mechanical processes''' include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the [[small intestine]]. '''Enzymatic hydrolysis''' is initiated by intraluminal processes requiring gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells.

Malabsorption constitutes the pathological interference with the normal physiological sequence of [[digestion]] (intraluminal process), absorption (mucosal process) and transport (postmucosal events) of nutrients.<ref name="julio">{{cite journal |author=Bai J |title=Malabsorption syndromes |journal=Digestion |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=530–46 |year=1998 |pmid=9705537 |doi=10.1159/000007529}}</ref>

==Clinical features==
[[File:Small-Intestine-highlighted.gif|thumb|Small intestine : major site of absorption]]
They can occur in a variety of ways and features might give a clue to the underlying condition. Symptoms can be [[intestine|intestinal]] or extra-intestinal - the former predominates in severe malabsorption.

* [[Diarrhoea]], often [[steatorrhoea]], is the most common feature.  Watery, diurnal and nocturnal, bulky, frequent stools are the clinical hallmark of overt malabsorption.  It is due to impaired water, [[carbohydrate]] and [[electrolyte]] absorption or irritation from unabsorbed [[fatty acid]]. Latter also results in [[bloating]], [[flatulence]] and abdominal discomfort.  Cramping pain usually suggests obstructive intestinal segment e.g. in [[Crohn's disease]], especially if it persists after defecation.<ref name="julio"/>
* Weight loss can be significant despite increased oral intake of nutrients.<ref>health a to z{{cite web |url=http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/malabsorption_syndrome.jsp |title=Malabsorption syndrome |accessdate=2007-05-10 |work=}}</ref>
* Growth retardation, failure to thrive, delayed [[puberty]] in children
* Swelling or [[oedema]] from loss of [[protein]]
* [[Anaemia]]s, commonly from vitamin [[vitamin B12|B<sub>12</sub>]], [[folic acid]] and [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] presenting as fatigue and weakness.
* Muscle [[cramp]] from decreased [[vitamin D]], [[calcium]] absorption. Also lead to [[osteomalacia]] and [[osteoporosis]]
* Bleeding tendencies from [[vitamin K]] and other [[coagulation factor]] deficiencies.

==Diagnosis==
There is no single, specific test for malabsorption. As for most medical conditions, investigation is guided by [[symptom]]s and signs. A range of different conditions can produce malabsorption and it is necessary to look for each of these specifically. Many tests have been advocated, and some, such as tests for pancreatic function are complex, vary between centers and have not been widely adopted. However, better tests have become available with greater ease of use, better sensitivity and specificity for the causative conditions. Tests are also needed to detect the systemic effects of deficiency of the malabsorbed nutrients (such as anaemia with vitamin B12 malabsorption).

===Blood tests===
*Routine [[blood test]]s may reveal [[anaemia]], high [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] or low [[serum albumin|albumin]]; which shows a high correlation for the presence of an organic disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bertomeu A, Ros E, Barragán V, Sachje L, Navarro S |title=Chronic diarrhea with normal stool and colonic examinations: organic or functional? |journal=J. Clin. Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=531–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1744388 |doi=10.1097/00004836-199110000-00011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Read N, Krejs G, Read M, Santa Ana C, Morawski S, Fordtran J |title=Chronic diarrhea of unknown origin |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=264–71 |year=1980 |pmid=7350049}}</ref> In this setting, [[microcytic anemia|microcytic anaemia]] usually implies iron deficiency and [[macrocytosis]] can be caused by impaired [[folic acid]] or [[vitamin B12|B12]] absorption or both. Low cholesterol or triglyceride may give a clue toward fat malabsorption.<ref name="Thomas" /> Low calcium and phosphate may give a clue toward [[osteomalacia]] from low vitamin D.<ref name="Thomas" />
*Specific vitamins like [[vitamin D]] or [[micro nutrient]] like [[zinc]] levels can be checked. Fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E & K) are affected in fat malabsorption. Prolonged [[prothrombin time]] can be caused by [[vitamin K]] deficiency.
*Serological studies. Specific tests are carried out to determine the underlying cause.
:[[IgA]] [[Anti-transglutaminase antibodies]] or IgA [[Anti-endomysial antibodies]] for [[Coeliac disease]] ([[gluten sensitive enteropathy]]).

===Stool studies===
* Microscopy is particularly useful in diarrhoea, may show protozoa like [[Giardia]], ova, cyst and other infective agents.
*[[Fecal fat|Fecal fat study]] to diagnose [[steatorrhoea]] is rarely performed nowadays.
*Low fecal pancreatic [[elastase]] is indicative of pancreatic insufficiency. [[Chymotrypsin]] and pancreolauryl can be assessed as well<ref name="Thomas">{{cite journal |author=Thomas P, Forbes A, Green J, Howdle P, Long R, Playford R, Sheridan M, Stevens R, Valori R, Walters J, Addison G, Hill P, Brydon G |title=Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea, 2nd edition |journal=Gut |volume=52 Suppl 5 |issue= 90005|pages=v1–15 |year=2003 |pmid=12801941 |doi=10.1136/gut.52.suppl_5.v1 |pmc=1867765}}[http://www.bsg.org.uk/pdf_word_docs/cd_body.pdf].</ref>

===Radiological studies===
*[[Barium follow through]] is useful in delineating [[small intestine|small intestinal]] [[anatomy]]. [[Barium enema]] may be undertaken to see [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]ic or ileal [[lesion]]s.
*CT abdomen is useful in ruling out structural abnormality,  done in pancreatic protocol when visualising [[pancreas]].
*[[Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP) to complement or as an alternative to [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]].

===Interventional studies===
[[File:Coeliac path.jpg|thumb|right|Biopsy of [[small bowel]] showing [[coeliac disease]] manifested by blunting of [[Intestinal villus|villi]], crypt [[hyperplasia]], and [[lymphocyte]] infiltration of crypts.]]
*[[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|OGD]] to detect [[duodenum|duodenal]] pathology and obtain D2 [[biopsy]] (for [[coeliac disease]], [[tropical sprue]], [[Whipple's disease]], abetalipoproteinaemia etc.)
*[[Enteroscopy]] for enteropathy and [[jejunum|jejunal]] aspirate and [[cell culture|culture]] for [[bacteria]]l overgrowth
*[[Capsule Endoscopy]] is able to visualise the whole [[small intestine]] and is occasionally useful.
*[[Colonoscopy]] is necessary in colonic and ileal disease.
*[[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] will show pancreatic and biliary structural abnormalities.

===Other investigations===
*<sup>75</sup>[[SeHCAT]] test to diagnose [[bile acid malabsorption]] in ileal disease or [[primary bile acid diarrhea]].
*Glucose hydrogen breath test for [[bacterial overgrowth]]
*[[Lactose]] hydrogen breath test for [[lactose intolerance]]
*Sugar probes or <sup>51</sup>Cr-EDTA to determine intestinal permeability.<ref name="julio"/>

===Obsolete tests no longer used clinically===
*[[D-xylose]] absorption test for mucosal disease or bacterial overgrowth. Normal in pancreatic insufficiency.
*[[Bile salt]] breath test (<sup>14</sup>C-glycocholate) to determine [[bile salt]] malabsorption.
*[[Schilling test]] to establish cause of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

==Management==
Treatment is directed largely towards management of underlying cause:
*Replacement of nutrients, [[electrolyte]]s and fluid may be necessary. In severe deficiency, hospital admission may be required for nutritional support and detailed advice from [[dietitian]]s. Use of enteral nutrition by naso-gastric or other [[feeding tube]]s may be able to provide sufficient nutritional supplementation. Tube placement may also be done by [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]], or surgical [[jejunostomy]]. In patients whose intestinal absorptive surface is severely limited from disease or surgery, long term [[total parenteral nutrition]] may be needed. 
*Pancreatic [[enzymes]] are supplemented orally in pancreatic insufficiency.
*Dietary modification is important in some conditions:
**Gluten-free diet in [[coeliac disease]].
**Lactose avoidance in [[lactose intolerance]].
*[[Antibiotic]] therapy to treat Small Bowel [[Bacterial overgrowth]].
*[[Cholestyramine]] or other [[bile acid sequestrants]] will help reducing diarrhoea in [[bile acid malabsorption]].
