'''Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome''' ('''RCVS''', sometimes called '''Call-Fleming syndrome''' or by a number of other names) is a poorly understood disease in which the arteries of the brain develop [[vasospasm]] without a clear cause (such as hemorrhage or trauma).<ref name=CallFleming>{{cite journal |author=Call GK, Fleming MC, Sealfon S, Levine H, Kistler JP, Fisher CM |title=Reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction |journal=Stroke |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=1159–70 |year=1988 |month=September |pmid=3046073 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/9/1159}}</ref> It may be present in varying amounts for months at a time.<ref name=CallFleming/> Vasospasm narrows arteries and can trigger severe [[headache]]s that wax and wane. When the vasospasms subside the headaches are relieved. Although the pathology is not known definitively, it is thought [[SSRI]]s, uncontrolled [[hypertension]], endocrine abnormality, and neurosurgical trauma are indicated to potentially cause vasospasm.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Calabrese LH, Dodick DW, Schwedt TJ, Singhal AB |title=Narrative review: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=146 |issue=1 |pages=34–44 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17200220 |url=http://www.annals.org/content/146/1/34.full.pdf}}</ref>

Symptoms result from vasospasms that narrow arteries, especially those around the [[circle of Willis]], which can lead to a dramatic headaches that are often of the [[thunderclap headache]] (sudden-onset) character. [[Ischemia]] is thought to cause various lesions and [[upper motor neuron]] damage in these patients which presents 3–4 days after migraine onset as focal neurological symptoms such as [[dysarthria]], unilateral [[weakness]], unsteady gait, and/or [[hyperreflexia]].<ref name=CallFleming/>

This condition features the unique property that the patient's cerebral [[arteries]] can spontaneously constrict and relax back and forth over a period of time without intervention and without clinical findings. Vasospasm is common post [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] and cerebral [[aneurysm]] but in RCVS only 25% of patients have symptoms post subarachnoid hemorrhage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moustafa RR, Allen CM, Baron JC |title=Call-Fleming syndrome associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage: three new cases |journal=J.

==Treatment==
[[Calcium channel blockers]] ([[nimodipine]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Awasthi D | url=http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/neurosurgery/nervecenter/spasm.html |title=Cerebral Vasospasm: Current Thinking & Future Trends |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref> [[verapamil]] which acts as a phenylalkylamine) reduce the calcium influx through [[L-type calcium channels]] in [[smooth muscle]] cells.  This leads to the [[vasodilation]] of arteries, which relieves symptoms and can act to prevent vasospasm.

==History==
The disease carries the name of Gregory Call and Marie Fleming, the first authors of the 1988 report in which doctors from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] (including [[Miller Fisher]]) described four patients with the characteristic symptoms and abnormal cerebral angiogram findings.<ref name=CallFleming/>
