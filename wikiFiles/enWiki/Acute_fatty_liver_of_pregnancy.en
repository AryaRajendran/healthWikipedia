==Clinical manifestations==
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (or hepatic lipidosis of pregnancy) usually manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy, but may occur any time in the second half of pregnancy, or in the [[puerperium]], the period immediately after delivery.<ref name=HinHinKo/>  On average, the disease presents during the 35th or 36th week of pregnancy.<ref name=Riely>{{cite journal |author=Riely CA |title=Acute fatty liver of pregnancy |journal=Semin. Liver Dis. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |year=1987 |pmid=3296215 |doi= 10.1055/s-2008-1040563|url=}}</ref>  The usual symptoms in the mother are non-specific including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (or lack of desire to eat) and abdominal pain;<ref name=Riely/> however, [[jaundice]] and [[fever]] may occur in as many as 70% of patients.<ref name=HinHinKo/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Riely CA, Latham PS, Romero R, Duffy TP |title=Acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

In patients with more severe disease, [[pre-eclampsia]] may occur, which involves [[hypertension|elevation of blood pressure]] and accumulation of fluid (termed [[edema]]).<ref name=Riely/>  This may progress to involvement of additional systems, including [[acute renal failure]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koroshi A, Babameto A |title=Acute renal failure during acute fatty liver of pregnancy |journal=Nephrol.

Many laboratory abnormalities are seen in acute fatty liver of pregnancy.  [[Liver function tests|Liver enzymes]] are elevated, with the AST and ALT enzymes ranging from minimal elevation to 1000 IU/L, but usually staying in the 300-500 range.<ref name=HinHinKo/>  [[Bilirubin]] is almost universally elevated.  [[Alkaline phosphatase]] is often elevated in [[pregnancy]] due to production from the [[placenta]], but may be additionally elevated.<ref name=ACG/>  Other abnormalities may include an elevated [[white blood cell count]], [[hypoglycemia]], elevated coagulation parameters, including the [[international normalized ratio]], and decreased [[fibrinogen]].<ref name=HinHinKo/><ref name=ACG/><ref name=Riely/>  Frank [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], or DIC, may occur in as many as 70% of patients.<ref name=HinHinKo/>

Abdominal [[ultrasound]] may show fat deposition in the [[liver]], but, as the hallmark of this condition is [[fatty liver|microvesicular steatosis]] (see pathology below), this may not be seen on ultrasound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Castro MA, Ouzounian JG, Colletti PM, Shaw KJ, Stein SM, Goodwin TM |title=Radiologic studies in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. A review of the literature and 19 new cases |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=839–43 |year=1996 |pmid=8951135 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Rarely, the condition can be complicated by rupture or [[necrosis]] of the liver, which may be identified by ultrasound.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is usually made on clinical grounds by the treating physician, but differentiation from other conditions affecting the [[liver]] may be difficult.<ref name=HinHinKo/>  The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is suggested by jaundice with a lesser elevation of liver enzymes, elevated white blood cell count, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and a clinically unwell patient.<ref name=ACG/>

A [[liver biopsy]] can provide a definitive diagnosis,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brunt EM |title=Liver biopsy interpretation for the gastroenterologist |journal=Curr Gastroenterol Rep |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=27–32 |year=2000 |pmid=10981000 |doi= 10.1007/s11894-000-0048-2|url=}}</ref> but is not always done, due to the increased chance of bleeding in acute fatty liver of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Castro MA, Goodwin TM, Shaw KJ, Ouzounian JG, McGehee WG |title=Disseminated intravascular coagulation and antithrombin III depression in acute fatty liver of pregnancy |journal=Am.

==Treatment==
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is best treated in a centre with expertise in [[hepatology]], high-risk [[obstetrics]], maternal-fetal medicine and [[neonatology]].  The physicians who treat this condition will often consult with experts in [[liver transplantation]] in severe cases.  Admission to the [[intensive care unit]] is recommended.<ref name=HinHinKo/>

Initial treatment involves supportive management with [[intravenous]] fluids, intravenous [[glucose]] and blood products, including [[fresh frozen plasma]] and [[cryoprecipitate]] to correct DIC.  The [[fetus]] should be monitored with [[cardiotocography]].  After the [[mother]] is stabilized, arrangements are usually made for delivery.  This may occur vaginally, but, in cases of severe bleeding or compromise of the mother's status, a [[caesarian section]] may be needed.<ref name=HinHinKo/>

The complications of acute fatty liver of pregnancy may require treatment after delivery, especially if pancreatitis occurs.<ref name=Pancreas/>  Liver transplantation is rarely required for treatment of the condition, but may be needed for mothers with severe DIC, those with rupture of the liver, or those with severe [[encephalopathy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pereira SP, O'Donohue J, Wendon J, Williams R |title=Maternal and perinatal outcome in severe pregnancy-related liver disease |journal=Hepatology |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=1258–1262 |year=1997 |pmid=9362370 |doi=10.1002/hep.510260525 |url=}}</ref>

==Pathology==
If a liver [[biopsy]] is needed for diagnosis of the condition, the mother should be appropriately stabilized and treated to reduce bleeding related complications.  The diagnosis can be made by a frozen-section (as opposed to a specimen in formalin) that is stained with the '''Oil red O''' stain, that shows microvesicular steatosis (or small collections of [[fat]] within the liver cells).  The microvesicular steatosis usually spares zone one of the liver, which is the area closest to the [[hepatic artery]].  On the regular trichrome stain, the liver cell [[cytoplasm]] shows a foamy appearance due to the prominence of fat.  [[Necrosis]] is rarely seen.  The diagnosis can be enhanced by [[electron microscopy]] which can be used to confirm the presence of microvesicular steatosis, and specifically the presence of megamitochondria and paracrystalline inclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bacq Y |title=Acute fatty liver of pregnancy |journal=Semin.

==Epidemiology and prognosis==
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare condition and occurs in approximately one in 7,000 to one in 15,000 pregnancies.<ref name=Mjahed/><ref name=Reyes/>  The mortality from acute fatty liver of pregnancy has been reduced significantly to 18%, and is now related primarily to complications, particularly DIC and infections.<ref name=HinHinKo/><ref name=Mjahed/>  After delivery, most mothers do well, as the stimulus for fatty acid overload is removed.  The disease can recur in future pregnancies, with a calculated genetic chance of 25%; the actual rate is lower, however.<ref name=Tein>{{cite journal |author=Tein I |title=Metabolic disease in the fetus predisposes to maternal hepatic complications of pregnancy |journal=Pediatr.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:LCHAD deficiency.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Schematic demonstrating [[mitochondria]]l [[fatty acid]] beta-[[oxidation]] and effects of LCHAD deficiency, a hallmark of acute fatty liver of pregnancy]]

The understanding of the causes of acute fatty liver of pregnancy 
has been improved by advances in mitochondrial [[biochemistry]].  Deficiency of LCHAD (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) leads to an accumulation of medium and long chain [[fatty acid]]s.  When this occurs in the [[fetus]], the unmetabolized fatty acids will re-enter the maternal circulation through the placenta, and overwhelm the beta-oxidation enzymes of the mother.<ref name=Tein/>  The [[gene]] responsible for LCHAD has been isolated, and the most common mutation found in acute fatty liver of pregnancy is the E474Q [[missense mutation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=IJlst L, Oostheim W, Ruiter JP, Wanders RJ |title=Molecular basis of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: identification of two new mutations |journal=J.

==History==
The disease was first described in 1940 by H. L. Sheehan as an "acute yellow atrophy" of the liver, then thought to be related to delayed [[chloroform]] poisoning.<ref name=HinHinKo/><ref name=Sheehan>{{cite journal |author=Sheehan HL |title=The pathology of acute yellow atrophy and delayed chloroform poisoning |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Br.
