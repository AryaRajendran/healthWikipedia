[[Glaucoma]] is a group of diseases affecting the [[optic nerve]] that results in [[vision loss]] and is frequently characterized by raised [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, and variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess [[aqueous humor]] from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

==Procedures that facilitate outflow of aqueous humor==
===Laser trabeculoplasty===

A '''trabeculoplasty''' is a modification of the [[trabecular meshwork]]. '''Laser trabeculoplasty''' (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas.<ref>[http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_gfollow_oph.htm University of Michigan Health System - Surgery for Glaucoma]</ref> The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are '''argon laser trabeculoplasty''' (ALT) and '''selective laser trabeculoplasty''' (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an [[argon laser]] to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork.<ref>[http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=47 EyeMDLink.com - Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT)]</ref> Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a [[Nd:YAG laser]] to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork and create less thermal damage than ALT.<ref>[http://www.revoptom.com/index.asp?ArticleType=SiteSpec&page=osc/105058/lesson.htm Review of Optometry - SLT: The Laser Picks Up Where Medications Leave Off]</ref><ref>[http://www.glaucoma.org/treating/a_new_type_of_g.html Glaucoma Research Foundation - SLT: A New Type of Glaucoma Surgery]</ref> SLT shows promise as a long term treatment.<ref>[http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_361.htm "Review of Ophthalmology: SLT for Glaucoma Threapy"] Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty</ref> In SLT a laser is used to selectively target the melanocytes in the trabecular meshwork. Though the mechanism by which SLT functions is not well understood, it has been shown in trials to be as effective as the older Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty. However, because SLT is performed using a much lower power laser, it does not appear to affect the structure of the trabecular meshwork (based on electron microscopy) to the same extent, so retreatment may be possible if the effects from the original treatment should begin wear off, although this has not been proven in clinical studies.  ALT is repeatable to some extent with measurable results possible.

===Iridotomy===
An '''iridotomy''' involves making puncture-like openings through the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A '''laser peripheral iridotomy''' (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/La-Pa/Laser-Iridotomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Laser iridotomy]</ref><ref>[http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=46 EyeMDLink.com - Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (PI)]</ref>

===Iridectomy===
An '''[[iridectomy]]''', also known as a '''[[corectomy]]''' or '''[[surgical iridectomy]]''', involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue.<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Fi-La/Iridectomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Iridectomy]</ref><ref name="Cline">{{cite book |author=Griffin, John W.; Cline, David; Hofstetter, Henry William |title=Dictionary of Visual Science |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location=Oxford |year=1997 |isbn=0-7506-9895-0 |edition=4th}}</ref> A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; and a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

===Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating===
Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure.<ref name=Jacobi97>{{cite journal |author=Jacobi PC, Dietlein TS, Krieglstein GK |title=Technique of goniocurettage: a potential treatment for advanced chronic open angle glaucoma |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=302–7 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9215060 |pmc=1722166 |url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9215060 |doi=10.1136/bjo.81.4.302}}</ref> An '''anterior sclerotomy''' or '''sclerostomy''' is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye <ref>http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/thcp_dorlands_content.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/dmd_s_05.htm</ref>

Filtering procedures are typically divided into either penetrating or non-penetrating types depending upon whether an intraoperative entry into the anterior chamber occurs.<ref>[http://www.thedoctorwillseeyounow.com/articles/other/glauc_32/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref><ref name="jdosmp.org">[http://www.jdosmp.org/glaucoma_filtering_surgeries.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site <ref name="revoptom.com">[http://www.revoptom.com/index.asp?ArticleType=SiteSpec&page=body/articles/10_2001/ro259.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>), and full thickness procedures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adam.about.com/reports/000025_8.htm |title=Glaucoma |publisher=Adam.about.com |date=2007-11-12 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> '''[[Trabeculectomy]]''' is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/St-Wr/Trabeculectomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Trabeculectomy]</ref> [http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=44].

The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal . Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lachkar Y, Neverauskiene J, Jeanteur-Lunel MN, ''et al.'' |title=Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy: a 6-year retrospective study |journal=Eur J Ophthalmol |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=26–36 |year=2004 |pmid=15005582 }}</ref> it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow collagen wick.<ref>[http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_794.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> '''Viscocanalostomy''' is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap.

'''Goniotomy''' and '''trabeculotomy''' are similar simple and directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork.<ref>{{EMedicine|oph|138|Glaucoma, Primary Congenital}}</ref><ref name=Aniridia>{{EMedicine|oph|317|Aniridia in the Newborn}}</ref> Goniotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy and laser goniotomy.

===Canaloplasty===
Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure utilizing microcatheter technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to Schlemm's canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened. By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye can then be relieved. Canaloplasty has two main advantages of over more traditional glaucoma sugeries.  The first of these advantages is an improved safety profile over trabeculectomy.  As canaloplasty does not require the creation of a bleb, significant long-term risks such as infection and hypotony (extremely low eye pressure) are avoided. The second main advantage is that when combined with cataract surgery, the IOP is reduced even further than when done alone.<ref name="JCRS 3-year CP Results" />

==Procedures that decrease production of aqueous humor==
Certain cells within the eye's [[ciliary body]] produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure.<ref>[http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_gfollow_oph.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>
