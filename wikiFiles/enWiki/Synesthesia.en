While cross-sensory [[metaphor]]s (e.g., "loud shirt," "bitter wind" or "prickly laugh") are sometimes described as "synesthetic", true neurological synesthesia is involuntary. It is estimated that synesthesia could possibly be as prevalent as 1 in 23 persons across its range of variants.<ref name="pmid17076063">{{cite journal |author=Simner J, Mulvenna C, Sagiv N, ''et al.'' |title=Synaesthesia: the prevalence of atypical cross-modal experiences |journal=Perception |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1024–33 |year=2006 |pmid=17076063 |doi= 10.1068/p5469|url=}}</ref> Synesthesia runs strongly in [[Heredity|families]], but the precise mode of inheritance has yet to be ascertained. Synesthesia is also sometimes reported by individuals under the influence of [[psychedelic drug]]s, after a [[stroke]], during a [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] seizure, or as a result of [[blindness]] or [[deafness]]. Synesthesia that arises from events after birth is referred to as "[[wikt:adventitious|adventitious]] synesthesia" to distinguish it from the more common [[congenital]] forms of synesthesia. Adventitious synesthesia involving drugs or stroke (but not blindness or deafness) apparently only involves sensory linkings such as sound → vision or touch → hearing; there are few, if any, reported cases involving culture-based, learned sets such as [[graphemes]], [[lexemes]], days of the week, or months of the year.

Although synesthesia was the topic of intensive scientific investigation in the late 19th century and early 20th century, it was largely abandoned by scientific research in the mid-20th century, and has only recently been rediscovered by modern researchers.<ref name="campen1999">{{cite journal |author=Campen C |title=Artistic and psychological experiments with synesthesia |journal=Leonardo |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |year=1999 |month= |pmid= |doi= 10.1162/002409499552948|url=}}</ref> [[Psychology|Psychological]] research has demonstrated that synesthetic experiences can have measurable behavioral consequences, while [[functional neuroimaging]] studies have identified differences in patterns of brain activation.<ref name="pmid16269367" /> Many people with synesthesia use their experiences to aid in their creative process, and many non-synesthetes have attempted to create works of art that may capture what it is like to experience synesthesia. Psychologists and neuroscientists study synesthesia not only for its inherent interest, but also for the insights it may give into cognitive and perceptual processes that occur in synesthetes and non-synesthetes alike.

==Definitional criteria==
Although sometimes spoken of as a "neurological condition," synesthesia is not listed in either the [[DSM-IV]] or the [[ICD]] classifications, since it most often does not interfere with normal daily functioning. Indeed, most synesthetes report that their experiences are neutral, or even pleasant.<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X">{{cite book |author=Sagiv, Noam; Robertson, Lynn C |title=Synesthesia: perspectives from cognitive neuroscience |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-19-516623-X |oclc=53020292}}</ref> Rather, like [[color blindness]] or [[perfect pitch]], synesthesia is a difference in perceptual experience and the term "neurological" simply reflects the brain basis of this perceptual difference (see [[#Associated cognitive traits|below]] for associated cognitive traits).

It was once assumed that synesthetic experiences were entirely different from synesthete to synesthete, but recent research has shown that there are underlying similarities that can be observed when large numbers of synesthetes are examined together. For example, sound-color synesthetes, as a group, tend to see lighter colors for higher sounds<ref name="pmid16683501">{{cite journal |author=Ward J, Huckstep B, Tsakanikos E |title=Sound-colour synaesthesia: to what extent does it use cross-modal mechanisms common to us all? |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=264–80 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16683501 |doi= 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70352-6|url=}}</ref> and grapheme-color synesthetes, as a group, share significant preferences for the color of each letter (e.g., A tends to be red; O tends to be white or black; S tends to be yellow etc.,<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/><ref name="simner2005">{{cite journal |author=Simner J, Ward J, Lanz M, et al. |title=Non-random associations of graphemes to colours in synaesthetic and non-synaesthetic populations |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1069–1085 |year=2005 |pmid=21038290 |doi=10.1080/02643290500200122 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid16297676">{{cite journal |author=Rich AN, Bradshaw JL, Mattingley JB |title=A systematic, large-scale study of synaesthesia: implications for the role of early experience in lexical-colour associations |journal=Cognition |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=53–84 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16297676 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.11.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010-0277(04)00209-4}}</ref>). Nonetheless, there are a great number of types of synesthesia, and within each type, individuals can report differing triggers for their sensations, and differing intensities of experiences. This variety means that defining synesthesia in an individual is difficult, and the majority of synesthetes are completely unaware that their experiences have a name.<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/> However, despite the differences between individuals, there are a few common elements that define a true synesthetic experience.

Neurologist [[Richard Cytowic]] identifies the following diagnostic criteria of synesthesia in his ''first'' edition book. However, the criteria are different in the second book:<ref name="isbn0-262-03296-1" /><ref name="isbn0-262-53255-7" /><ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" />
# Synesthesia is involuntary and [[Automaticity|automatic]].
# Synesthetic perceptions are spatially extended, meaning they often have a sense of "location." For example, synesthetes speak of "looking at" or "going to" a particular place to attend to the experience.
# Synesthetic percepts are consistent and generic (i.e., simple rather than pictorial).
# Synesthesia is highly [[Memory|memorable]].
# Synesthesia is laden with [[affect (psychology)|affect]].

Cytowic's early cases included individuals whose synesthesia was frankly projected outside the body (e.g., on a  "screen" in front of one's face). Later research showed that such stark externalization occurs in a minority of synesthetes. Refining this concept, Cytowic and Eagleman<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /> differentiate between "localizers" and "non-localizers" to distinguish those synesthetes whose perceptions have a definite sense of spatial quality.

==Experiences==
Synesthetes often report that they were unaware their experiences were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives, as has been documented in interviews with synesthetes on how they discovered synesthesia in their childhood.<ref name="campen2007" /> The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary. This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience. Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences can lead to a degree of [[sensory overload]].<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/>

Though often stereotyped in the popular media as a medical condition or neurological aberration, many synesthetes themselves do not perceive their synesthetic experiences as a handicap. To the contrary, most report it as a gift—an additional "hidden" sense—something they would not want to miss. Most synesthetes become aware of their "hidden" and different way of perceiving in their childhood. Some have learned how to apply this gift in daily life and work. Synesthetes have used their gift in memorizing names and telephone numbers, mental arithmetic, but also in more complex creative activities like producing visual art, music, and theater.<ref name="campen2007" />

Despite the commonalities which permit definition of the broad phenomenon of synesthesia, individual experiences vary in numerous ways. This variability was first noticed early on in synesthesia research<ref name="isbn0-543-94462-X">{{cite book |author=Flournoy, Théodore |title=Des phénomènes de synopsie (Audition colorée) |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |location= |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-543-94462-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> but has only recently come to be re-appreciated by modern researchers. Some grapheme → color synesthetes report that the colors seem to be "projected" out into the world (called "projectors"), while most report that the colors are experienced in their "mind's eye" (called "associators").<ref name="pmid15535169">{{cite journal |author=Dixon MJ, Smilek D, Merikle PM |title=Not all synaesthetes are created equal: projector versus associator synaesthetes |journal=Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=335–43 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15535169 |doi= 10.3758/CABN.4.3.335|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=1530-7026&volume=4&issue=3&spage=335&aulast=Dixon}}</ref> It is estimated that approximately one or two per hundred grapheme-color synesthetes are projectors; the rest are associators.<ref name="pmid15535169"/>

Additionally, some grapheme → color synesthetes report that they experience their colors strongly, and show perceptual enhancement on the perceptual tasks described below, while others (perhaps the majority) do not,<ref name="pmid15797557"/> perhaps due to differences in the stage at which colors are evoked. Some synesthetes report that [[vowel]]s are more strongly colored, while for others [[consonant]]s are more strongly colored.<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/> In summary, self reports, autobiographical notes by synesthetes and interviews show a large variety in types of synesthesia, intensity of the synesthetic perceptions, awareness of the difference in perceiving the physical world from other people, the way they creatively use their synesthesia in work and daily life.<ref name="campen2007" /><ref name="dittmar2007">Dittmar, A. (Ed.) (2007) Synästhesien. Roter Faden durchs Leben? Essen, Verlag Die Blaue Eule.</ref> The descriptions below give some examples of synesthetes' experiences, which have been experimentally tested, but do not exhaust their rich variety.

==Various forms==
Synesthesia can occur between nearly any two senses or perceptual modes, and at least one synesthete, [[Solomon Shereshevsky]], experienced synesthesia that linked all five senses. Given the large number of forms of synesthesia, researchers have adopted a convention of indicating the type of synesthesia by using the following notation x → y, where x is the "inducer" or trigger experience, and y is the "concurrent" or additional experience. For example, perceiving letters and numbers (collectively called [[grapheme]]s) as colored would be indicated as grapheme → color synesthesia. Similarly, when synesthetes see colors and movement as a result of hearing musical tones, it would be indicated as tone → (color, movement) synesthesia.

While nearly every logically possible combination of experiences can occur, several types are more common than others.

===Grapheme → color synesthesia===
{{Main|Grapheme-color synesthesia}}

[[File:Number Form--colored.jpg|thumb|left|From ''[[Wednesday is Indigo Blue]]''.<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /> Note this example's upside-down clock face.]] In one of the most common forms of synesthesia, grapheme → color synesthesia, individual letters of the alphabet and numbers (collectively referred to as [[grapheme]]s), are "shaded" or "tinged" with a [[color]]. While different individuals usually do not report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies with large numbers of synesthetes find some commonalities across letters (e.g., A is likely to be red).<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/><ref name="simner2005"/>

As a child, [[Patricia Lynne Duffy|Pat Duffy]] told her father, "I realized that to make an R all I had to do was first write a P and draw a line down from its loop. And I was so surprised that I could turn a yellow letter into an orange letter just by adding a line." Another grapheme synesthete says, "When I read, about five words around the exact one I'm reading are in color. It's also the only way I can spell. In elementary school I remember knowing how to spell the word 'priority' [with an "i" rather than an "e"] because ... an 'e' was out of place in that word because 'e's were yellow and didn't fit."<ref name="slashdot">{{cite web |title=Slashdot Discussion |url=http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=140022&cid=11726211 |date=2006-02-19 |accessdate=2006-08-14 }}</ref>

===Spatial Sequence Synesthesia===
A special form of the condition, in which people tend to see all numerical sequences they come across as points in space. For instance, the number 1 might be farther away and the number 2 might be closer. A new study shows that those with SSS have superior memories. They were able to recall past events and memories far better, and in far greater detail than those without the condition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Sound → color synesthesia===
According to Richard Cytowic, sound → color synesthesia, or [[chromesthesia]] is "something like fireworks": voice, music, and assorted environmental sounds such as clattering dishes or dog barks trigger color and firework shapes that arise, move around, and then fade when the sound ends.<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /> For some, the stimulus type is limited (e.g., music only, or even just a specific musical key); for others, a wide variety of sounds triggers synesthesia.

Sound often changes the perceived hue, brightness, scintillation, and directional movement. Some individuals see music on a "screen" in front of their faces. Deni Simon, for whom music produces waving lines "like oscilloscope configurations – lines moving in color, often metallic with height, width and, most importantly, depth. My favorite music has lines that extend horizontally beyond the 'screen' area."<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" />

Individuals rarely agree on what color a given sound is (composers [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] famously disagreed on the colors of music keys){{fact|date=December 2012}}; however, synesthetes show the same trends as non-synesthetes do. For example, both groups say that [[Loudness|loud]] tones are brighter than soft tones, and that lower tones are darker than higher tones.  Synaesthetes nevertheless choose more precise colours  than non-synesthetes and are more consistent in their choice of colours given a set of sounds of varying pitch, timbre and composition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=J.|coauthors=Huckstep B., Tsakanikos E.|title=Sound-colour synaesthesia: To what extent does it use cross-modal mechanisms common to us all?

===Personification===
{{Main|Ordinal linguistic personification}}

U is a soulless sort of thing. 4 is honest, but… 3 I cannot trust… 9 is dark, a gentleman, tall and graceful, but politic under his suavity."<ref name="calkins1893"/> Likewise, Cytowic's subject MT says, "I [is] a bit of a worrier at times, although easy-going; J [is] male; appearing jocular, but with strength of character; K [is] female; quiet, responsible...."<ref name="isbn0-262-03296-1"/>

For some people in addition to numbers and other ordinal sequences, objects are sometimes imbued with a sense of personality. Recent research has begun to show that alphanumeric personification co-varies with other forms of synesthesia, and is consistent and automatic, as required to be considered a form of synesthesia.<ref name="pmid17381259" />

===Lexical → gustatory synesthesia===
{{Main|Lexical-gustatory synesthesia}}
In the rare lexical → gustatory synesthesia, individual words and the [[phonemes]] of spoken language evoke taste sensations in the mouth. According to [[James Wannerton]], "Whenever I hear, read, or articulate (inner speech) words or word sounds, I experience an immediate and involuntary taste sensation on my tongue. These very specific taste associations never change and have remained the same for as long as I can remember."

Jamie Ward and Julia Simner have extensively studied this form of synesthesia, and have found that the synesthetic associations are constrained by early food experiences.<ref name="pmid12963263">{{cite journal |author=Ward J, Simner J |title=Lexical-gustatory synaesthesia: linguistic and conceptual factors |journal=Cognition |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=237–61 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=12963263 |doi= 10.1016/S0010-0277(03)00122-7|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027703001227}}</ref><ref name="wardsimnerauyeung2005">{{cite journal |author=Ward J, Simner J, Auyeung V |title=A comparison of lexical-gustatory and grapheme-colour synaesthesia |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=28–41 |year=2005 |month= |pmid= 21038239|doi=10.1080/02643290442000022 |url=}}</ref> For example, James Wannerton has no synesthetic experiences of coffee or curry, even though he consumes them regularly as an adult. Conversely, he tastes certain breakfast cereals and candies that are no longer sold.

Additionally, these early food experiences are often paired with tastes based on the phonemes in the name of the word (e.g., /I/, /n/ and /s/ trigger James Wannerton’s taste of mince) although others have less obvious roots (e.g., /f/ triggers sherbet). To show that phonemes, rather than graphemes are the critical triggers of tastes, Ward and Simner showed that, for James Wannerton, the taste of egg is associated to the phoneme /k/, whether spelled with a "c" (e.g., accept), "k" (e.g., York), "ck" (e.g., chuck) or "x" (e.g., fax). Another source of tastes comes from semantic influences, so that food names tend to taste of the food they match, and the word "blue" tastes "inky."

===Auditory-tactile synesthesia===
Auditory-tactile synesthesia may originate from birth or be acquired sometime in life. It is one of the rarest forms of synesthesia.<ref name = Marcus J. Naumer and Jasper J.

===Mirror touch synesthesia===
In this rare form of synesthesia, seeing someone else being touched, leads to feeling the touch as well. This means that people can literally feel the pain of others when they see them get hurt. Such a process of simulation is hypothized to be important for understanding and empathings with others.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Banissy|first=Michael J.|title=Mirror-touch synesthesia is linked with empathy|url= http://www.daysyn.com/Banissy_Wardpublished.pdf|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2007|month=July|volume=10|pages=815–816|doi=10.1038/nn1926|last2=Ward|first2=Jamie|issue=7|pmid=17572672}}</ref>

==Research history==
{{Main|History of synesthesia research}}

The interest in colored hearing dates back to Greek antiquity, when philosophers asked if the color (''chroia'', what we now call timbre) of music was a quantifiable quality.<ref>Gage, J. ''Colour and Culture. Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''. (London:Thames & Hudson, 1993).</ref> Isaac Newton proposed that musical tones and color tones shared common frequencies, as did Goethe in his book, "Theory of Color." Despite this idea being false, there is a long history of building color organs such as the [[clavier à lumières]] on which to perform colored music in concert halls.<ref name="Peacock, Kenneth 1988">Peacock, Kenneth.

Sidler (Eds.). Farbe – Licht – Musik. Synaesthesie und Farblichtmusik. Bern: Peter Lang, 2006.</ref>

The first medical description of colored hearing is in a German 1812 thesis.<ref>Mahling, F. (1926) Das Problem der `audition colorée': Eine historisch-kritische Untersuchung. Archiv für die gesamte Psychologie, 57, 165–301.</ref> The father of [[psychophysics]], [[Gustav Fechner]] reported the first empirical survey of colored letter photisms among 73 synesthetes in 1871,<ref>Fechner, Th.

As the 1980s [[cognitive revolution]] began to make inquiry into internal subjective states respectable again, scientists once again looked to synesthesia. Led in the United States by Larry Marks and [[Richard Cytowic]], and later in England by [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] and [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey Gray]], research explored the reality, consistency, and frequency of synesthetic experiences. In the late 1990s, the focus settled on grapheme → color synesthesia, one of the most common<ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/><ref name="pmid16297676"/> and easily studied types. Synesthesia is now the topic of scientific books and papers, Ph.D. theses, documentary films, and even novels.

Since the rise of the Internet in the 1990, synesthetes began contacting one another and creating Web sites devoted to the condition. These early grew into international organizations such as the [[American Synesthesia Association]], the [[UK Synaesthesia Association]], the [[Belgian Synaesthesia Association]], the German Synesthesia Association and the Netherlands Synesthesia Web Community.

==Prevalence and genetic basis==
Early estimates of prevalence varied widely (from 1 in 20 to 1 in 20,000). These studies all had the methodological shortcoming of relying on [[self-selection]], meaning individuals reporting their experience to investigators. Random population studies later determined that 1 in 23 individuals have some kind of synesthesia, while 1 in 90 have colored graphemes.<ref name="pmid17076063"/> Colored days of the week and colored graphemes are the most common types.<ref name="pmid17076063"/><ref name="isbn0-19-516623-X"/>

Many studies noted that synesthesia runs in families, consistent with a genetic origin for the condition. [[Francis Galton]]'s 1880 report noted a familial component. Studies from the 1990s<ref name="pmid8378132">{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Harrison J, Goldstein LH, Wyke M |title=Coloured speech perception: is synaesthesia what happens when modularity breaks down? |journal=Perception |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=419–26 |year=1993 |pmid=8378132 |doi= 10.1068/p220419|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid8983047">{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Burt L, Smith-Laittan F, Harrison J, Bolton P |title=Synaesthesia: prevalence and familiality |journal=Perception |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1073–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8983047 |doi= 10.1068/p251073|url=}}</ref> that noted a much higher prevalence in women than men (up to 6:1) most likely suffered from a [[Biased sample|sampling bias]] due to the fact that women are more likely to self-disclose than men.

At first, the observed patterns of inheritance were consistent with an [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] mode of inheritance because there had been no verified reports of father-to-son transmission, whereas father-to-daughter, mother-to-son and mother-to-daughter transmission were readily observed<ref name="isbn0-262-03296-1"/><ref name="pmid8983047"/><ref name="pmid15991697">{{cite journal |author=Ward J, Simner J |title=Is synaesthesia an X-linked dominant trait with lethality in males? |journal=Perception |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=611–23 |year=2005 |pmid=15991697 |doi= 10.1068/p5250|url=}}</ref> However, the first [[genome-wide association study]] failed to find X-linkage,<ref name = "AsherAmJHumGenetics09">{{cite journal|author = Asher, JE, Lamb, JA, Brocklebank, D, ''et al.'' |title = A Whole-Genome Scan and Fine-Mapping Linkage Study of Auditory-Visual Synesthesia Reveals Evidence of Linkage to Chromosomes 2q24, 5q33, 6p12, and 12p12|journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 84|issue = 2|pages= 1–7|year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.01.012|url =|pmid = 19200526|pmc = 2668015}}</ref> and furthermore verified two cases of father-to-son transmission.

[[File:Stroop interference.jpg|thumb|250px|Reaction times for answers that are congruent with a synesthete’s automatic colors are faster than those whose answer is incongruent.<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" />]]
The simplest approach is test-retest reliability over long periods of time, where synesthetes consistently score much higher—around 90% after years, compared to 30–40% after just a month in non-synesthetes even when they are warned they will be retested—using stimuli of color names, color chips, or a computer-screen color picker providing 16.7 million choices.<ref name="isbn0-262-03296-1" /><ref name="pmid8983047"/>

Modified versions of the [[Stroop effect]] are popular. In the standard paradigm, it is harder to name the ink color of the word "red," for example, when it is printed in blue ink than when the ink is red. Similarly, if a grapheme → color synesthete is shown the digit 4 (which he sees as red, say) in blue ink, he is slower to name the ink color than when it is printed in red. He sees the blue ink, but the same sort of conflict responsible for the standard Stroop effect occurs between the ink color and the [[automaticity|automatic]] synesthetic color of the grapheme. The conflict is strongest when the ink color is the [[opponent process|opponent color]] to the synesthetic one (e.g., red vs. green), indicating that synesthetic color perception uses the same mechanism as the perception of real colors.<ref name="pmid17576258">{{cite journal |author=Nikolić D, Lichti P, Singer W |title=Color opponency in synaesthetic experiences |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=481–6 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17576258 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01925.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0956-7976&date=2007&volume=18&issue=6&spage=481}}</ref>

Cross-sensory Stroop tests are possible: for example, a music → color synesthete must name a red swatch while listening to a sound that produces a blue sensation,<ref name="pmid16517513">{{cite journal |author=Ward J, Tsakanikos E, Bray A |title=Synaesthesia for reading and playing musical notes |journal=Neurocase |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=27–34 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16517513 |doi=10.1080/13554790500473672 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/13554790500473672&magic=pubmed}}</ref> or a musical key → taste synesthete must identify a bitter taste while hearing a musical interval that tastes sweet .<ref name="pmid15744291">{{cite journal |author=Beeli G, Esslen M, Jäncke L |title=Synaesthesia: when coloured sounds taste sweet |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7029 |pages=38 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15744291 |doi=10.1038/434038a}}</ref> Likewise, Stroop tests work even in those for whom merely ''thinking about a numeral'' elicits color. Take a person who sees 7 as yellow and 9 as blue, and make the task one of having to say a math solution out loud followed by naming a color square. In the illustration, having to answer "7" and then "yellow" is congruent with the subject’s synesthesia, which unconsciously primes him to respond faster than controls. The automatic blueness of 9, however, interferes with naming the green square, slowing him down compared to controls.

Synesthetic colors can also ''improve performance'' for some synesthetes. Inspired by tests for [[color blindness]], [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|Ramachandran]] and Hubbard presented synesthetes and non-synesthetes with a matrix of 5s in which embedded 2s formed a hidden pattern such as a square, diamond, rectangle or triangle.<ref name="ramachandran2001" /> For someone who sees 2s as red and 5s as green, for example, synesthetic colors help zero in on the embedded figure. Subsequent careful studies have found ''substantial variability'' among synesthetes in their ability to do this.<ref name="pmid15797557"/><ref name="pmid15535169"/> It certainly does not happen instantaneously; while synesthesia is evoked very early in perceptual processing, it does not occur prior to [[attention]].<ref name="pmid16683496">{{cite journal |author=Edquist J, Rich AN, Brinkman C, Mattingley JB |title=Do synaesthetic colours act as unique features in visual search? |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=222–31 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16683496 |doi= 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70347-2|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid16683497">{{cite journal |author=Sagiv N, Heer J, Robertson L |title=Does binding of synesthetic color to the evoking grapheme require attention? |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=232–42 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16683497 |doi= 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70348-4|url=}}</ref>

==Possible neural basis==
{{Main|Neural basis of synesthesia}}

[[File:synaesthesiabrain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Regions thought to be cross-activated in grapheme-color synesthesia (green=grapheme recognition area, red=V4 color area).<ref name="ramachandran2001"/>]]

Dedicated regions of the brain are specialized for given functions. Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions may account for the many types of synesthesia. For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called [[Visual cortex#V4|V4]] (see figure).<ref name="ramachandran2001"/> One line of thinking is that a failure to [[Synaptic pruning|prune]] synapses that are normally formed in great excess during the first few years of life may cause such cross-activation.

An alternate possibility is disinhibited feedback, or a reduction in the amount of inhibition along normally existing feedback pathways.<ref name="pmid11164734">{{cite journal |author=Grossenbacher PG, Lovelace CT |title=Mechanisms of synesthesia: cognitive and physiological constraints |journal=Trends Cogn.

However, if normal feedback were not inhibited as usual, then signals feeding back from late stages of multi-sensory processing might influence earlier stages such that tones could activate vision. Cytowic & Eagleman find support for the disinhibition idea in the so-called acquired forms<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /> of synesthesia that occur in non-synesthetes under certain conditions: [[Temporal lobe epilepsy]], head trauma, stroke, and brain tumors. They also note that it can likewise occur during stages of meditation, deep concentration, [[sensory deprivation]], or with use of [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelics]] such as [[LSD]] or [[mescaline]], or even, in some cases, [[marijuana]].<ref name = "Cytowic_Eagleman2009" />  However, synesthetes report that common [[stimulant]]s, like [[caffeine]] and [[cigarette]]s do not affect the strength of their synesthesia, nor do [[alcoholic beverages]].<ref name = "Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /><sup>p.&nbsp;137–140</sup>

[[Functional neuroimaging]] studies using [[positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] demonstrate significant differences between the brains of synesthetes and non-synesthetes. fMRI shows V4 activation in both word → color and grapheme → color synesthetes.<ref name="pmid15797557"/><ref name="pmid11914723">{{cite journal |author=Nunn JA, Gregory LJ, Brammer M, ''et al.'' |title=Functional magnetic resonance imaging of synesthesia: activation of V4/V8 by spoken words |journal=Nat.

==The role of meaning==
{{Main|Ideasthesia}}

Evidence has shown that concurrents in synesthesia may be operating at the level of the meaning of the stimulus (i.e. semantic representations), not at the level of the sensory inputs. For example, if presented with letter A, a synesthete would associated concurrent experiences only once the letter has been recognized and the meaning of the stimulus has been extracted. Hence, the basics for understanding synesthesia may be in the semantic structures that, uniquely for synesthetes, associate sensory-like experiences. It has been proposed that a more accurate definition of the phenomenon is within the context of [[ideasthesia]].

==Associated cognitive traits==
Little is known about what, if any, cognitive traits might be associated with synesthesia. As early as 1980, [[Richard Cytowic]] first noted mild difficulties in [[left-right confusion]], [[dyscalculia|arithmetic]], and sense of direction.<ref name="isbn0-262-03296-1"/> These observations await large-scale confirmation. What has been confirmed is elevated, sometimes [[eidetic memory|photographic]], memory.<ref name="smilek2002a">{{cite journal |author=Smilek D, Dixon MJ, Cudahy C, Merikle PM |title=Synesthetic color experiences influence memory |journal=Psychological Science |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=548–52 |year=2002 |month= |pmid= 12430840|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00496 |url=}}</ref> It was reading [[Alexander Luria]]'s 1968 book ''The Mind of a Mnemonist'' that alerted Cytowic to the link between synesthesia and enhanced memory: Luria's subject had a 5-fold synesthesia that gave him extra hooks on which to hang and remember numerous facts.

Autism and epilepsy occur with synesthesia more often than chance predicts. [[Daniel Tammet]], the savant who set a European record for reciting the digits of [[pi]], has all three conditions indicating that they might share an underlying genetic cause. Synesthesia has so far been linked to a region on [[chromosome 2]] that is associated with autism and epilepsy.<ref name = "AsherAmJHumGenetics09" />

Researchers study synesthesia raising questions such as how the brain combines information from different sensory modalities, referred to as [[crossmodal]] perception and [[multisensory integration]].

[[File:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|250px|Booba and Kiki shapes|Tests like this demonstrate that people do not attach sounds to visual shapes arbitrarily. Which shape would you call "Bouba" and which "Kiki?"]]

An example of this is the [[bouba/kiki effect]]. In an experiment first designed by [[Wolfgang Köhler]], people are asked to choose which of two shapes is named ''bouba'' and which ''kiki.'' 95% to 98% of people choose ''kiki'' for the angular shape and ''bouba'' for the rounded one. Individuals on the island of [[Tenerife]] showed a similar preference between shapes called ''takete'' and ''maluma.'' Even 2.5 year-old children (too young to read) show this effect.<ref name="pmid16669803">{{cite journal |author=Maurer D, Pathman T, Mondloch CJ |title=The shape of boubas: sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults |journal=Dev Sci |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=316–22 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16669803 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00495.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1363-755X&date=2006&volume=9&issue=3&spage=316}}</ref>

Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.<ref name="ramachandran2001"/> The rounded shape may intuitively be named ''bouba'' because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound, while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to articulate ''kiki''. The sound of K is also harder and more forceful than that of B. Such "synesthesia-like mappings" suggest that this effect might be the neurological basis for [[sound symbolism]], in which sounds are non-arbitrarily mapped to objects and actions in the world.

Given synesthetes' extraordinary conscious experiences, researchers hope that their study will provide better understanding of [[consciousness]] and its [[neural correlate]]s, meaning what the brain mechanisms that make us conscious might be. In particular, synesthesia might be relevant to the [[philosophy|philosophical]] problem of [[qualia]],<ref name="isbn0-631-19764-8" /><ref name="ramachandran2001"/><ref name="gray2002">{{cite journal |author=Gray JA, Chopping S, Nunn J et al. |title=Implications of synaesthesia for functionalism: Theory and experiments |journal=Journal of Consciousness |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=5–31 |year=2002 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=}}</ref> given that  synesthetes experience extra qualia (e.g., a colored sound).

{{Main|Synesthesia in art}}

The word "synesthesia" has been used for 300 years to describe very different things, from poetry and metaphor to deliberately contrived mixed-media applications such as [[son et lumière (show)|son et lumière]] shows or [[Polyester (film)|odorama]]. It is crucial{{why|date=April 2013}} to separate artists using synesthesia as ''an intellectual idea''—pseudo-synesthetes such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who used such titles as "Music-Pink and Blue"—from those who had the genuine perceptual variety, such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]] or [[Olivier Messiaen]].

Synesthetic art historically refers to multi-sensory experiments in the genres of [[visual music]], [[music visualization]], [[audiovisual art]], [[abstract film]], and [[intermedia]].<ref name="campen2007" /><ref name="campen1999"/><ref name="berman1999">{{cite journal |author=Berman G |title=Synesthesia and the Arts |journal=Leonardo |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=15–22 |year=1999 |month= |pmid= |doi= 10.1162/002409499552957|url=}}</ref><ref name="isbn3-7913-2082-3">{{cite book |author=Maur, Karin von |title=The Sound of Painting: Music in Modern Art (Pegasus Library) |publisher=Prestel |location=Munich |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=3-7913-2082-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-500-27818-0">{{cite book |author=Gage, John D. |title=Colour and culture: practice and meaning from antiquity to abstraction |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-500-27818-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-520-22611-9">{{cite book |author=Gage, John D. |title=Color and meaning: art, science, and symbolism |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-520-22611-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Distinct from neuroscience, the concept of synesthesia in the arts is regarded as the simultaneous perception of multiple stimuli in one [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] experience.<ref>Campen, Cretien van (2009) Visual Music and Musical Paintings. The Quest for Synesthesia in the Arts. In: F. Bacci & D. Melcher. Making Sense of Art, making Art of Sense. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> Only recently can science verify and study synesthesia in artists; for deceased artists, one must interpret (auto)biographical information.

Synesthetic art can refer to either art created by synesthetes or art that attempts to convey the synesthetic experience. It is an attempt to understand the relation between the experiences of born  synesthetes, non-synesthetes, and an appreciation of such art by both groups. These distinctions are not mutually exclusive given that art by a synesthete might also evoke synesthesia-like experiences in the viewer.

Contemporary synesthetic artists such as [[Carol Steen]]<ref name="Steen">Steen, C. (2001). Visions Shared: A Firsthand Look into Synesthesia and Art, Leonardo, Vol. 34, No. 3, Pages 203–208 {{doi|10.1162/002409401750286949}}</ref> and Marcia Smilack<ref>[http://www.marciasmilack.com/synethesia-intro.php Marcia Smilack Website] Accessed 20 Aug 2006.</ref> (a synesthetic photographer who waits until she gets a synesthetic response from what she sees, and then takes the picture,) have described in detail how they use their synesthesia to create their artworks. They demonstrate the complex interplay between personal experience and artistic creation.

Synesthesia has been a source of inspiration for artists, composers, poets, novelists, and digital artists. [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]] writes explicitly about synesthesia in several novels. [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] (a synesthete) and Mondrian (not a synesthete) both experimented with image-music correspondences in their paintings. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] composed color music that was deliberately contrived and based on the [[circle of fifths]], whereas [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]] invented a new method of composition (the [[modes of limited transposition]]) to specifically render his bi-directional sound-color synesthesia. For example, the red rocks of [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]] are depicted in his symphony ''[[Des canyons aux étoiles]]'' ("From the Canyons to the Stars"). New art movements such as literary symbolism, non-figurative art, and visual music have profited from experiments with synesthetic perception and contributed to the public awareness of synesthetic and multi-sensory ways of perceiving.<ref name="campen2007" />

==Literary depictions==
{{Main|Synesthesia in literature}}
{{Main|Synesthesia in fiction}}

Synesthesia is sometimes used as a plot device or way of developing a character's inner life. Author and synesthete [[Patricia Lynne Duffy|Pat Duffy]] describes five ways in which synesthetic characters have been used in modern fiction.<ref name = "Duffy2006">{{cite conference | author = [[Patricia Lynne Duffy|Duffy, P.L.]] | year = 2006 | title = Images of Synesthetes and their Perceptions of Language in Fiction | conference = 6th Annual Meeting of the [[American Synesthesia Association]] | url = http://www.synesthesia.info/florida.html | location = University of South Florida}}</ref><ref name = "DuffySimner2010">{{cite journal | author = Duffy, P.L. & Simner, J. | year = 2010 | title = Synaesthesia in fiction | journal = Cortex | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 277–278 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2008.11.003 | pmid = 19081086}}</ref>
# Synesthesia as [[Romanticism|romantic]] ideal: in which the condition illustrates the Romantic ideal of transcending one's experience of the world. Books in this category include ''[[The Gift (Nabokov novel)|The Gift]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]].
# Synesthesia as pathology: in which the trait is pathological. Books in this category include ''The Whole World Over'' by [[Julia Glass]].
# Synesthesia as romantic pathology: in which synesthesia is pathological but also provides an avenue to the Romantic ideal of transcending quotidian experience. Books in this category include Holly Payne’s ''The Sound of Blue.''
# Synesthesia as psychological health and balance: ''Painting Ruby Tuesday'' by [[Jane Yardley]], and ''[[A Mango-Shaped Space]]'' by [[Wendy Mass]].
# Synesthesia as young adult lterature and science fiction: ''Ultraviolet'' by R.J. Anderson

Many literary depictions of synesthesia are not accurate. Some say more about an author's ''interpretation'' of synesthesia than the phenomenon itself.

==People with synesthesia==
{{Main|List of people with synesthesia}}
Determining synesthesia from the historical record is fraught with error unless (auto)biographical sources explicitly give convincing details.

Famous synesthetes include [[David Hockney]], who perceives music as color, shape, and configuration, and who uses these perceptions when painting opera stage sets but not while creating his other artworks.<ref>see Cytowic, Richard E. 2002. ''Synesthesia: a Union of the Senses.''  Second edition.  Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, and Cytowic, R.E. & Eagleman, D.M. (2009) ''Wednesday is Indigo Blue."

James aka [[Aphex Twin]] (who claims to be inspired by [[lucid dream]]s as well as music); and classical pianist [[Hélène Grimaud]].  Although it has not been verified, [[Pharrell Williams]], of the groups [[The Neptunes]] and [[N.E.R.D.]], claims to experience synesthesia,<ref>It just always stuck out in my mind, and I could always see it. I don't know if that makes sense, but I could always visualize what I was hearing... Yeah, it was always like weird colors." From a Nightline interview with Pharrell</ref> and to have used it as the basis of the album [[Seeing Sounds]].  Singer/songwriter [[Marina and the Diamonds]] experiences music → color synesthesia, and reports colored days of the week.<ref>[http://www.itv.com/lifestyle/loosewomen/videos/m/celebrityguests/marinaandthediamonds/ Loose Women | Marina and the Diamonds – ITV Lifestyle] ''[[ITV]]'' – 27 April 2010 – Retrieved 28 April 2010.</ref>

Some artists frequently mentioned as synesthetes did not in fact have the condition. [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s 1911 [[Prometheus: Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']], for example, is a deliberate contrivance whose color choices are based on the [[circle of fifths]] and appear to have been taken from [[Madame Blavatsky]].<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /><ref name="Dann">{{cite book |author=Dann, Kevin T. |title=Bright colors falsely seen: synaesthesia and the search for transcendental knowledge |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-300-06619-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The musical score has a separate staff marked ''luce'' whose "notes" are played on a [[color organ]]. Technical reviews appear in period volumes of ''Scientific American.''<ref name="Cytowic_Eagleman2009" /> On the other hand, his older colleague Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (who was perceived as a fairly conservative composer), was in fact a synesthete.<ref>This is according to an article in the Russian press, Yastrebtsev V. "On N.A.Rimsky-Korsakov's color sound- contemplation." Russkaya muzykalnaya gazeta, 1908, N 39-40, pp. 842–845 (in Russian), cited by Bulat Galeyev (1999).</ref>

French poets [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] wrote of synesthetic experience but there is no evidence they were synesthetes themselves. Baudelaire's 1857 ''{{lang|fr|Correspondances}}'' ([http://www.doctorhugo.org/synaesthesia/baudelaire.html text available here]) introduced the notion that the senses can and should intermingle. Baudelaire participated in a hashish experiment by psychiatrist [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]], and became interested in how the senses might correspond.<ref name="campen2007" /> Rimbaud later wrote ''Voyelles'' (1871)  ([http://www.doctorhugo.org/synaesthesia/rimbaud.html text available here]), which was perhaps more important than ''{{lang|fr|Correspondances}}'' in popularizing synesthesia, although he later boasted ''"J'inventais la couleur des voyelles!"'' [I invented the colors of the vowels!].

In addition to being a natural mimic and polyglot, the lauded Cartoon-network voice actor, [[Brian Hamilton (actor)|Brian Hamilton]], is a self-ascribed synesthete.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Daniel Tammet]] wrote a book on his experiences with synesthesia, called ''Born on a Blue Day''.<ref name = "BlueDay">{{cite book |author=Tammet, Daniel |title=Born on a Blue Day |publisher=Free Press |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-1416535072 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Joanne Harris]], author of [[Chocolat (novel)|''Chocolat'']], is a synesthete who says she experiences colours as scents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chocolat author Joanne Harris talks about her latest novel Blue Eyed Boy|url=http://metro.co.uk/2010/04/07/chocolat-author-joanne-harris-talks-about-her-latest-novel-blue-eyed-boy-226133/|newspaper=Metro|date=7 Apr 2010}}</ref> Her novel ''Blueeyedboy'' features various aspects of synesthesia.
