'''''Marcus Welby, M.D.''''' is an American [[medical drama]] [[television program]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 23, 1969, to July 29, 1976. It starred [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] as a family practitioner with a kind bedside manner and [[James Brolin]] as the younger doctor he often worked with, and was produced by David Victor and David J. O'Connell. The pilot, ''A Matter of Humanities'', had aired as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' on March 26, 1969.

==Overview==
As with most medical dramas of the day, the plots often concerned a professional conflict between well-meaning physicians. Here, Dr. Welby's unorthodox way of treating patients was pitted against the more strait-laced methods of Dr. Steven Kiley ([[James Brolin]]). The catch with this particular program was that the roles were reversed in that Dr. Kiley was much younger than Dr. Welby. In the similar series ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'', it is the older doctor who is more orthodox and the younger who is radical. The opening credits of "Welby" for each [[episode]] reminded viewers of the generation gap between the two doctors, Welby driving his long sedan and Kiley riding a motorcycle. Welby had served in the US Navy as a doctor during the war, and was a widower. He owned a sail boat and enjoyed the ocean.

The doctors worked alongside each other in their private practice in [[Santa Monica, California]], regularly working in conjunction with the nearby Lang Memorial Hospital. (This was later revealed in exterior shots to be the real-life St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, California now renamed simply as [[Saint John's Health Center]].) At the office, their loyal secretary-nurse and friend, and Welby's hinted at secret lover was Consuelo Lopez ([[Elena Verdugo]]). Other characters that appeared throughout the years included Dr. Welby's frequent girlfriend Myra Sherwood ([[Anne Baxter]]), his daughter Sandy and her son Phil (first [[Christine Belford]], then [[Anne Schedeen]], as Sandy and Gavin Brendan as Phil), and Kathleen Faverty ([[Sharon Gless]]), another secretary. Dr. Kiley met and married public relations director Janet Blake ([[Pamela Hensley]]) in 1975, at the beginning of the show's last season on the air.

In the episode ''Designs'' which aired on March 12, 1974. Young was reunited with his ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' co-star, [[Jane Wyatt]]; she played a [[fashion designer]] whose marriage to an embittered paraplegic led her to fall in love with the gentle doctor while keeping her marriage a secret most of the episode.

==Medical features==
Its handling of many varied medical cases – some common, some uncommon – made it an instant hit for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Story lines included [[impotence]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[brain damage]], [[breast cancer]], [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, [[epilepsy]], [[leukemia]], [[dysautonomia]], [[rape]], [[Alzheimer's Disease]] and addiction to painkillers, among others. At its second season (1970–1971), it ranked #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]], becoming the first ABC show to top the list. The same year, both Young and Brolin won [[Emmy Awards]] for their work, as did the show for Outstanding Dramatic Series. Young won a [[Golden Globe]] in 1972 for his performance. Members of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] served as technical advisers for the series and reviewed every script for medical accuracy.

==Controversy==
The show twice found itself at the center of controversy and protests by gay activists. In response to the 1973 episode "[[The Other Martin Loring]]", about a middle-aged man whom Welby advised to resist his [[homosexual]] impulses, the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA) [[Zap (action)|zapped]] ABC, occupying its New York headquarters and picketing.<ref>Capsuto, p. 92</ref> The next year, "[[The Outrage (Marcus Welby)|The Outrage]]" sparked nationwide demonstrations because its story of a teenage student's being sexually assaulted by his male teacher conflated homosexuality with [[pedophilia]]. Seven [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] refused to buy [[television advertising]] time, and 17 [[television network]] [[affiliate]]s refused to air the episode.<ref>Capsuto, pp. 106–109</ref><ref>Tropiano, pp. 18–21</ref> This was the first known instance of network affiliates refusing a network episode in response to protests.<ref>Alwood, p. 150</ref>

It was the first show in ABC's history to become the #1 show on television.

==Cancellation==
By the mid-1970s, the popularity of medical dramas began to wane. Ratings for both ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'' and CBS' ''Medical Center'' began to drop, as did the ratings for daytime dramas ''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[The Doctors (1963 TV series)|The Doctors]].'' Previous episodes initially went into [[Syndication (television)|syndication]] in the fall of 1975 as ''Robert Young, Family Doctor'' (to avoid confusion with the first-run episodes still airing on ABC).  The show ended its run in 1976 after a total of 169 episodes were made.

==Television movies==
In 1984, the reunion movie ''The Return of Marcus Welby, M.D.'' aired, with Young and Verdugo reprising their roles. Another movie was made in 1988, ''Marcus Welby, M.D.: A Holiday Affair.''
