'''Atrophy''' is the partial or complete [[wasting]] away of a part of the [[body]]. Causes of atrophy include [[mutation]]s (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor [[nourishment]], poor [[circulatory system|circulation]], loss of [[hormone|hormonal]] support, loss of [[nerve]] supply to the target [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]], excessive amount of [[apoptosis]] of cells, and disuse or lack of [[exercise]] or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. Hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are referred to as ''trophic'' [noun] in medical practice ('trophic" is an adjective that can be paired with various nouns). ''Trophic'' describes the ''trophic condition'' of tissue. A diminished ''muscular trophic'' is designated as ''atrophy''.

Atrophy is the general [[physiological]] process of reabsorption and breakdown of [[biological tissue|tissues]], involving [[apoptosis]] on a [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular level. When it occurs as a result of [[disease]] or loss of trophic support due to other disease, it is termed ''pathological atrophy'', although it can be a part of normal body development and [[homeostasis]] as well.
== Atrophy examples ==
===Normal development===
Examples of atrophy as part of normal development include shrinking and the involution of the [[thymus]] in early childhood, and the [[tonsil]]s in adolescence. In old age, affects include, but are not limited to, loss of teeth, hair, thinning of skin that creates wrinkles, weakening of muscles, loss of weight in organs and sluggish mental activity. <ref>{{cite book|title=Disease and Its Causes|year=1913|publisher=New York Henry Holt and Company London Williams and Norgate The University Press, Cambridge, U.S.A.|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1499279&pageno=21|author=W.

===Muscle atrophies===
{{main|Muscle atrophy}}

''Disuse atrophy'' of [[muscle]]s ([[muscle atrophy]]) and [[bone]]s, with loss of mass and strength, can occur after prolonged immobility, such as extended [[bedrest]], or having a body part in a cast (living in darkness for the eye, bedridden for the legs etc.).  This type of atrophy can usually be reversed with exercise unless severe.  Astronauts in microgravity must exercise regularly to minimize atrophy of their limb muscles.

There are many diseases and conditions which cause atrophy of muscle mass.  For example diseases such as cancer and AIDS induce a body wasting syndrome called "[[cachexia]]", which is notable for the severe [[muscle atrophy]] seen.  Other syndromes or conditions which can induce skeletal [[muscle atrophy]] are [[congestive heart failure]] and liver disease.

During aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass.  This condition is called "[[sarcopenia]]", and may be distinct from atrophy in its pathophysiology.  While the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, it may be induced by a combination of a gradual failure in the "[[satellite cells]]" which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003188.htm | title = Muscle atrophy | publisher= [[MedlinePlus]] | accessdate = 2007-10-02 | date = 2007-05-22 | last = Campellone | first = Joseph V. | format = html | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071013000952/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003188.htm| archivedate= 13 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Dystrophies, myositis, and motor neuron conditions ===
Pathologic atrophy of muscles can occur with diseases of the motor nerves, or diseases of the muscle tissue itself.  Examples of atrophying nerve diseases include CMT (Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome) [[poliomyelitis]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), and [[Guillain-Barr√© syndrome]].  Examples of atrophying muscle diseases include [[muscular dystrophy]], [[myotonia congenita]], and [[myotonic dystrophy]].

Changes in Na+ channel isoform expression and spontaneous activity in muscle called fibrillation can also result in muscle atrophy.

===Gland atrophy===
The [[adrenal gland]]s atrophy during prolonged use of exogenous [[glucocorticoid]]s like [[prednisone]].  Atrophy of the [[breast]]s can occur with prolonged [[estrogen]] reduction, as with [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[menopause]].  Atrophy of the testes occurs with prolonged use of enough exogenous [[sex steroid]] (either [[androgen]] or [[estrogen]]) to reduce [[gonadotropin]] secretion.

===Vaginal atrophy===
In post-menopausal women, the walls of the vagina become thinner ([[Atrophic vaginitis]]).  The mechanism for the age-related condition is not yet clear, though there are theories that the effect is caused by decreases in estrogen levels.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://medicine.science-tips.org/health/diseases-and-conditions/types-of-atrophy.html | title = Types of Atrophy  | accessdate = 2007-10-02 | format = html | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928072029/http://medicine.science-tips.org/health/diseases-and-conditions/types-of-atrophy.html| archivedate= 28 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  This atrophy, and that of the breasts concurrently, is consistent with the homeostatic (normal development) role of atrophy in general, as after menopause the body has no further functional biological need to maintain the reproductive system which it has permanently shut down.

==Research==
It has been reported that some drugs might prevent the loss of the muscle wasting that occurs in immobile, bedridden patients.<ref name="ND2006">{{cite news | url=http://www2.netdoctor.co.uk/news/index.asp?y=2006&m=5&d=25&id=123026 |title = Drug could stop muscle wasting' |publisher = NetDoctor.co.uk  |date = 2006-05-25 |accessdate = 2006-05-27}}{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>
Testing upon mice showed that it blocked the activity of a protein present in the muscle that is involved in muscle atrophy.<ref name="FASEBJ2006-Wang">{{cite journal | author=Wang X, Hockerman GH, Green Iii HW, Babbs CF, Mohammad SI, Gerrard D, Latour MA, London B, Hannon KM, Pond AL | title=Merg1a K+ channel induces skeletal muscle atrophy by activating the ubiquitin proteasome pathway | journal=FASEB J | year=2006 | month=May24 | pmid=16723379 | volume=20 | pages=1531 | doi=10.1096/fj.05-5350fje | issue=9}}</ref>
However the concerns for the drug's long-term effects on the heart preclude its routine use in humans for this indication, and further alternative drugs are being sought.<ref name="ND2006" />
