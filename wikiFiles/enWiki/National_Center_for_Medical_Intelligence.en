The '''National Center for Medical Intelligence''' (NCMI) at [[Fort Detrick, Maryland]], USA — formerly the [[Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center]] (AFMIC) — is an agency within the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) of the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD);<ref>DoD Instruction 6420.01, "National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI)", March 20, 2009, http://ftp.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/i6420_01.pdf.</ref> its mission is to track and assess the full range of global health issues for the DoD, specifically monitoring and analyzing health events that could negatively impact the health of U.S. military and civilian populations.<ref>Matthew Watson: "DIA Establishes National Center for Medical Intelligence", http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/biosecurity_briefing/archive/govt_response/2008-07-11-dianatlctrmedintell.html, July 11, 2008.</ref>

==Mission==
NCMI's mission, always critical to protecting the health of deployed forces, has grown even more important recently with support to [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operations Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraqi Freedom]] and the global war on terrorism.<ref>Megan Eckstein: "Detrick soldiers steadily being sent to Middle East", ''Frederick News-Post'', originally published January 17, 2010, http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?storyid=100201.</ref> At the same time, the center is increasing its use of new technologies to transform its delivery of timely, forward-leaning, customer-focused medical intelligence.

As part of the DIA, this tri-service organization produces finished, all-source medical intelligence assessments, forecasts and databases on foreign military and civilian health care capabilities and trends, worldwide infectious disease risks, global environmental health risks, and militarily significant life science issues, to include biotechnology and nuclear, biological and chemical medical defense advancements.

NCMI is the only organization in the world with this comprehensive medical intelligence mission. As such, it has a diverse customer base, from operational and tactical commanders, preventive medicine personnel, and medical planners and researchers to the policymakers in the DoD, the White House staff and other federal agencies.

The current (2012) director is [[United States Air Force]] Colonel Anthony Rizzo.

==History==
The NCMI traces its origins to the organization of a medical intelligence section in the Office the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. Prior to entry into the war, the Surgeon General established medical intelligence to support planning for the administration of military governments in U.S. Army occupied territories occupied by providing detailed guides for civil public health and sanitation conditions. As the prospect of United States entry into the war increased, the need for a full-time staff of medical intelligence analysts became apparent. During the war, medical intelligence products were part of formal war planning with the incorporation of health and sanitary data into War Department Strategic Surveys.

In 1963, the DIA absorbed medical intelligence as a division in its production branch. During the later [[Cold War]] era, the medical intelligence division underwent several evolutions in size, structure and specific function. In the early 1970s, the division became victim of DoD downsizing initiatives in the post-Vietnam era. Recognizing its importance, the Army Surgeon General again took sole responsibility for the medical intelligence function in the form of the United States Army Medical Intelligence and Information Agency (USAMIIA). USAMIIA was renamed as AFMIC in 1982 when it became a tri-service organization.<ref>Robert L.

On July 2, 2008, AFMIC was formally redesignated as the NCMI in a ceremony at Ft. Detrick.<ref>Colonel Anthony M.

==Organization==
The NCMI is organized into a support division and two substantive divisions—the Epidemiology and Environmental Health Division and the Medical Capabilities Division. Each substantive division is made up of two teams, the duties of which include:

'''Environmental Health'''

*Identify and assess environmental risks that can degrade force health or effectiveness including chemical and microbial contamination of the environment, toxic industrial, chemical and radiation accidents, and environmental terrorism/warfare.

*Assess the impact of foreign environmental health issues and trends on environmental security and national policy.

'''Epidemiology'''

*Identify, assess, and report on infectious disease risks that can degrade mission effectiveness of deployed forces and/or cause long-term health implications.

*Alert operational and policy customers to foreign disease outbreaks that have implications for national security and policy formulation, including homeland defense and deliberately introduced versus naturally occurring disease outbreaks.

'''Life Sciences and Biotechnology'''

*Assess foreign basic and applied biomedical and biotechnological developments of military medical importance.

*Assess foreign civilian and military pharmaceutical industry capabilities.

*Assess foreign scientific and technological medical advances for defense against nuclear, biological and chemical warfare.

*Prevent technological surprise.

*Prevent proliferation of dual-use equipment and knowledge.

'''Medical Capabilities'''

*Assess foreign military and civilian medical capabilities, including treatment facilities, medical personnel, emergency and disaster response, logistics, and medical/pharmaceutical industries.

*Maintain and update an integrated data base on all medical treatment, training, pharmaceutical, and research and production facilities.
