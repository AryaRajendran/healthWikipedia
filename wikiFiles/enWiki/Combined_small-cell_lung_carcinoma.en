'''Combined small cell lung carcinoma''' (or c-SCLC, and rarely rendered as "small-cell lung carcinoma") is a form of multiphasic [[lung cancer]] that is [[medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] by a [[pathologist]] when a [[malignant]] [[tumor]] arising from transformed [[cell (biology)|cells]] originating in [[lung]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] contains a component of [[small cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC) admixed with one (or more) components of [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]] (NSCLC).<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref><ref name='GotohYamamoto'>{{cite journal |author=Gotoh M, Yamamoto Y, Huang CL, Yokomise H |title=A combined small cell carcinoma of the lung containing three components: small cell, spindle cell and squamous cell carcinoma |journal=Eur J Cardiothorac Surg |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=1047–9 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15519208 |doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2004.08.002 |url=http://ejcts.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15519208}}</ref><ref name='FouadMowafy'>{{cite journal |author=Fouad Ismail M, Mowafy AA, Sameh SI |title=A combined small cell carcinoma of the lung containing three components: small cell, spindle cell and squamous cell carcinoma, revisited |journal=Eur J Cardiothorac Surg |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=734; author reply 735 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15784404 |doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2005.01.003 |url=http://ejcts.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15784404}}</ref>

Approximately 99% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]], a term that indicates that the malignant neoplasm is composed of, or descended from, cells of epithelial lineage (i.e. derived from [[embryo]]nic [[endoderm]], as is the case in lung carcinomas, or from [[ectoderm]]), and/or that the malignant cells exhibit tissue architectural, cytological, or molecular features characteristically found in epithelial cells.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y }}</ref> Under WHO-2004, lung carcinomas are divided into 8 major taxa:<ref name='who2004'/>

SCLC is generally considered to be the most aggressive of these major forms of lung cancer, with the worst long term prognosis and survival rates.<ref name='TravisTravis'/> As a result, it is recommended that all multiphasic malignant lung tumors (i.e. those with more than one histological pattern) that are found to contain ''any'' proportion of SCLC cells should be classified as c-SCLC, and ''not'' as combined forms of any of the other histological variants present in the tumor.<ref name='who2004' /> Currently, the only exception to this recommendation occurs in cases where [[anaplastic]] [[large cell lung carcinoma]] (LCLC) is the second histological component. In these instances, a minimum of 10% of the viable malignant cells present must be identified as LCLC before the tumor is considered to be a c-SCLC.<ref name='who2004' /><ref name='NicholsonBeasley'>{{cite journal |author=Nicholson SA, Beasley MB, Brambilla E, ''et al.'' |title=Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC): a clinicopathologic study of 100 cases with surgical specimens |journal=Am.

==Incidence==
Reliable comprehensive [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] statistics for c-SCLC are unavailable. In the literature, the frequency with which the c-SCLC variant is diagnosed largely depends on the size of tumor samples, tending to be higher in series where large surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]] specimens are examined, and lower when diagnoses are based on small [[Cytopathology|cytology]] and/or [[biopsy]] samples.

In a study of 408 consecutive patients with SCLC, Quoix and colleagues found that presentation as a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is particularly indicative of a c-SCLC — about 2/3 of their SPN's were pathologically confirmed to be c-SCLC's containing a large cell carcinoma component.<ref name='QuoixFraser'>{{cite journal |author=Quoix E, Fraser R, Wolkove N, Finkelstein H, Kreisman H |title=Small cell lung cancer presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule |journal=Cancer |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=577–82 |year=1990 |month=August |pmid=2163746 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19900801)66:3<577::AID-CNCR2820660328>3.0.CO;2-Y }}</ref>

==Significance==
In terms of case numbers, the estimated 8,800 to 13,200 c-SCLC cases occurring annually in the U.S. makes this disease roughly comparable in incidence to Hodgkin's Disease (8,500), testicular cancer (8,400), cervical cancer (11,300), and cancers of the larynx (12,300).<ref name="ACSCFF2009"/> However, these four "better-known" cancers all have exceptionally high (85%-95%) cure rates. In contrast, less than 10% of c-SCLC patients will be cured, and thus the number of annual cases of c-SCLC is a reasonable approximation of the annual number of deaths.

However, as patients with tumors containing mixtures of histological subtypes are usually excluded from [[clinical trials]],<ref name='trials'>http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search</ref> the properties of multiphasic tumors like c-SCLC are much less well understood than those of monophasic tumors.<ref name='RuffiniRena'>{{cite journal |author=Ruffini E, Rena O, Oliaro A, ''et al.'' |title=Lung tumors with mixed histologic pattern.

==Histogenesis==
The exact mechanisms and histogenesis of lung cancers are topics of intense interest and research. It is currently thought that most cases of lung cancer probably occur after damage to genomic [[DNA]] causes [[malignant transformation]] of a single [[multipotent]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. This newly formed entity, sometimes referred to as a [[cancer stem cell]], then begins to divide uncontrollably, giving rise to new daughter cancer cells in an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] (or near exponential) fashion. Unless this runaway [[cell division]] process is checked, a clinically apparent tumor will eventually form as the mass reaches sufficient size to be detected clinically, or begins to cause  signs or symptoms.<ref name='CroceNEJM'>{{cite journal |author=Croce CM |title=Oncogenes and cancer |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=5 |pages=502–11 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18234754 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra072367 }}</ref> Approximately 98% of lung cancers are eventually diagnosed as a [[histology|histological]] variant of [[carcinoma]], a term that signifies that the tumor derives from transformed [[epithelial]] cells, or cells that have acquired epithelial characteristics as a result of cell [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]].<ref name="TravisTravis"/>

The histogenesis of c-SCLC and other multiphasic forms of lung cancer appear to be complex and varied phenomena. In most cases of c-SCLC, [[genomic]] and [[immunohistochemical]] studies suggest that the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] [[divergence]] of the separate components occurs when a SCLC-like cell is transformed into a cell with the potential to develop NSCLC variant characteristics, and not ''vice versa''. Daughter cells of this [[transdifferentiated]] SCLC-like cell then repeatedly divide and, under both [[intrinsic]] [[genomic]] and [[extrinsic]] environmental influences, acquire additional [[mutations]] (a process known as tumor [[progression]]). The end result is that the tumor acquires specific cytologic and architectural features suggesting a mixture of SCLC and NSCLC.<ref name='WagnerKitabayashi'/>

Other analyses suggest that, in at least in some cases, more highly differentiated variants of NSCLC (i.e. [[adenocarcinoma]]) can "progress" to give rise to areas within the primary (original) tumor (or its [[metastasis|metastases]]) that develop histological and molecular characteristics of SCLC.<ref name='AlamGustafson'>{{cite journal |author=Alam N, Gustafson KS, Ladanyi M, ''et al.'' |title=Small-cell carcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in a never-smoker with gefitinib-responsive adenocarcinoma of the lung |journal=Clin Lung Cancer |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=E1–4 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20837450 |doi=10.3816/CLC.2010.n.046 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1525-7304(11)70072-9}}</ref> 

Other molecular studies, however, suggest that — in at least a minority of cases — independent development of the components in c-SCLC occurs via mutation and transformation in two different cells in close spatial proximity to each other, due to [[field cancerization]]. In these cases, repeated division and mutational progression in both cancer stem cells generate a biclonal "collision tumor".<ref name='BuysAviel'>{{cite journal |author=Buys TP, Aviel-Ronen S, Waddell TK, Lam WL, Tsao MS |title=Defining genomic alteration boundaries for a combined small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma |journal=J Thorac Oncol |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=227–39 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19179901 |doi=10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181952678 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1556-0864&volume=4&issue=2&spage=227}}</ref><ref name='KnudsonNATURE'>{{cite journal |author=Knudson AG |title=Two genetic hits (more or less) to cancer |journal=Nat.

Regardless of which of these mechanisms give rise to the tumor, recent studies suggest that, in the later stages of c-SCLC [[oncogenesis]], continued mutational progression within each tumor component results in the cells of the combined tumor developing [[molecular]] profiles that more closely resemble each other than they do cells of the "pure" forms of the individual morphological variants.<ref name='DAddaPelosi'>{{cite journal |author=D'Adda T, Pelosi G, Lagrasta C, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic alterations in combined neuroendocrine neoplasms of the lung |journal=Mod.

C-SCLC also occurs quite commonly after treatment of "pure" SCLC with [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiation]], probably as a result of a combination of tumor genome-specific "progressional" mutations, [[stochastic]] genomic phenomena, and additional mutations induced by the [[cytotoxic]] therapy.<ref name='MorinagaOkamoto'>{{cite journal |author=Morinaga R, Okamoto I, Furuta K, ''et al.'' |title=Sequential occurrence of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer with the same EGFR mutation |journal=Lung Cancer |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=411–3 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17601631 |doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2007.05.014 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169-5002(07)00317-0}}</ref><ref name='MangumGreco'>{{cite journal |author=Mangum MD, Greco FA, Hainsworth JD, Hande KR, Johnson DH |title=Combined small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer |journal=J.

==Staging==
[[Staging]] of c-SCLC patients is usually performed in an analogous fashion to patients with "pure" [[small cell lung carcinoma]].

For several decades, SCLC has been staged according to a [[dichotomous]] distinction of "limited disease" (LD) ''vs.'' "extensive disease" (ED) tumor burdens.<ref name='TravisIASLC'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, IASLC Staging Committee |title=Reporting lung cancer pathology specimens.

However, more recent data reviewing outcomes in very large numbers of SCLC patients suggests that the [[TNM staging system]] used for NSCLC is also reliable and valid when applied to SCLC patients, and that more current versions may allow better treatment decisionmaking and [[prognostication]] in SCLC than with the old dichotomous staging protocol.<ref name="TravisIASLC"/><ref name='WittekindGreene'>{{cite book |author=Wittekind C, Greene FL, Henson DE, Hutter RVP, Sobin LH |chapter=Lung |chapterurl= |editor=Wittekind C, Greene FL, Henson DE, Hutter RVP, Sobin LH |title=UICC International Union Against Cancer, TNM Supplement: a commentary on uniform use |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn= |pages=47,97–8,143–9 |edition=3rd}}</ref><ref name='ShepherdCrowley'>{{cite journal |author=Shepherd FA, Crowley J, Van Houtte P, ''et al.'' |title=The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer lung cancer staging project: proposals regarding the clinical staging of small cell lung cancer in the forthcoming (seventh) edition of the tumor, node, metastasis classification for lung cancer |journal=J Thorac Oncol |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=1067–77 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18090577 |doi=10.1097/JTO.0b013e31815bdc0d |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1556-0864&volume=2&issue=12&spage=1067}}</ref>

==Treatment==
A very large number of clinical trials have been conducted in "pure" SCLC over the past several decades.<ref name="SCLCTRIALRESULTS"/> As a result, evidence-based sets of guidelines for treating monophasic SCLC are available.<ref name="NCCNSCLC"/><ref name="SimonTurrisi"/> While the current set of SCLC treatment guidelines recommend that c-SCLC be treated in the same manner as "pure" SCLC, they also note that the evidence supporting their recommendation is quite weak.<ref name="SimonTurrisi"/> It is likely, then, that the optimum treatment for patients with c-SCLC remains unknown.<ref name="RuffiniRena"/>

The current generally accepted standard of care for all forms of SCLC is concurrent chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) in LD, and CT only in ED. For complete responders (patients in whom all evidence of disease disappears), prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is also given. TRT serves to increase the probability of total eradication of residual locoregional disease, while PCI aims to eliminate any [[micrometastases]] to the [[brain]].<ref name="SimonTurrisi"/>

Surgery is not often considered as a treatment option in SCLC (including c-SCLC) due to the high probability of distant metastases at the time of [[diagnosis]].<ref name='Inde'>{{cite journal |author=Ihde DC |title=Current status of therapy for small cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=Cancer |volume=54 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2722–8 |year=1984 |month=December |pmid=6093983 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2722::AID-CNCR2820541419>3.0.CO;2-P }}</ref> This paradigm was driven by early studies showing that the administration of systemic therapies resulted in improved survival as compared to patients undergoing surgical resection.<ref name='LennoxFlavell'>{{cite journal |author=Lennox SC, Flavell G, Pollock DJ, Thompson VC, Wilkins JL |title=Results of resection for oat-cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=7575 |pages=925–7 |year=1968 |month=November |pmid=4176258 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(68)91163-X }}</ref><ref name='FoxScadding'>{{cite journal |author=Fox W, Scadding JG |title=Medical Research Council comparative trial of surgery and radiotherapy for primary treatment of small-celled or oat-celled carcinoma of bronchus.
