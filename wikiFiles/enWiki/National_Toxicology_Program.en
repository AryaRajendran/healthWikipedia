==History==
The program was established in 1978 by Joseph A. Califano, Jr., then [[Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare]] (today known as the Department of Health and Human Services).  The program arose from congressional concerns about the health effects of chemical agents in the environment. In October 1981, Secretary Richard S. Schwiker granted permanent status to the program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=720163C9-BDB7-CEBA-FE4B970B9E72BF54|title=History of the NTP - National Toxicology Program|publisher=National Toxicology Program|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>
