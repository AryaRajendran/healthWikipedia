The '''Injury Severity Score''' ('''ISS''') is an established medical score to assess trauma severity.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Baker | first = S.P. | coauthors = B. O'Neill, W. Haddon Jr., W.B.

It is used to define the term major trauma.

==Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)==
The [[Abbreviated Injury Scale]] (AIS) is an anatomically based consensus-derived global severity scoring system that classifies each injury in every body region according to its relative severity on a six point ordinal scale: 
# Minor
# Moderate
# Serious
# Severe
# Critical
# Maximal (currently untreatable).

There are nine AIS chapters corresponding to nine body regions: 
#Head
#Face
#Neck
#Thorax
#Abdomen
#Spine
#Upper Extremity
#Lower Extremity
#External and other.

The official website for AIS is http://www.aaam1.org/ais/. The site is conducted by the AIS Committee of the [[Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine]] (AAAM)

==ISS Definition==
The ISS is based (see below) upon the [[Abbreviated Injury Scale]] (AIS).
To calculate an ISS for an injured person, the body is divided into six ISS body regions. These body regions are:
*[[Head]] or [[neck]] - including cervical spine
*[[Face]] - including the facial skeleton, nose, mouth, eyes and ears
*[[Chest]] - thoracic spine and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]
*Abdomen or pelvic contents - abdominal organs and lumbar spine
*Extremities or pelvic girdle - [[human pelvis|pelvic]] skeleton
*External

To calculate an ISS, take the highest AIS severity code in each of the three most severely injured ISS body regions, square each AIS code and add the three squared numbers for an ISS ({{math|''ISS'' {{=}} ''A''<sup>2</sup> + ''B''<sup>2</sup> + ''C''<sup>2</sup>}} where A, B, C are the AIS scores of the three most injured ISS [[human body|body]] regions). 
The ISS scores ranges from 1 to 75 (i.e. AIS scores of 5 for each category). If any of the three scores is a 6, the score is automatically set at 75.  Since a score of 6 ("unsurvivable") indicates the futility of further medical care in preserving life, this may mean a cessation of further care in [[triage]] for a patient with a score of 6 in any category.<ref>Trauma.org website. http://www.trauma.org/index.php/main/article/383/  Accessed Nov. 18, 2009</ref>

==Major trauma==
A major trauma (or polytrauma) is defined as the Injury Severity Score being greater than 15.<ref name="Copes et al."/><ref>''Pathophysiology of polytrauma'' - Keel, M. & Trentz O. - ''Injury'', Volume 36, Issue 6, Pages 691-709</ref>
