=== Withdrawal ===

Withdrawal symptoms of methamphetamine primarily consist of [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and increased [[appetite]]. Symptoms may last for days with occasional use and weeks or months with chronic use, with severity dependent on the length of time and the amount of methamphetamine used. Withdrawal symptoms may also include [[anxiety]], [[irritability]], [[headaches]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[akathisia|restlessness]], [[hypersomnia|excessive sleeping]], [[Lucid dreaming|vivid or lucid dreams]], deep [[REM sleep]], and [[suicidal ideation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=McGregor C, Srisurapanont M, Jittiwutikarn J, Laobhripatr S, Wongtan T, White JM |title=The nature, time course and severity of methamphetamine withdrawal |journal=Addiction |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=1320–9 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16128721 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01160.x}}</ref>

=== Long-term ===

Methamphetamine use has a high association with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[suicide]] as well as serious [[heart disease]], amphetamine [[Stimulant psychosis|psychosis]], [[anxiety]], and violent behaviors. Methamphetamine also has a very high [[addiction]] risk.<ref name="Darke-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Darke | first1 = S. | last2 = Kaye | first2 = S. | last3 = McKetin | first3 = R. | last4 = Duflou | first4 = J. | title = Major physical and psychological harms of methamphetamine use | journal = Drug Alcohol Rev | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–62 | month = May | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1080/09595230801923702 | pmid = 18368606 }}</ref>

Methamphetamine is not directly [[neurotoxic]] but long-term use can have neurotoxic side-effects.

=== Tolerance ===

As with other amphetamines, tolerance to methamphetamine is not completely understood but is known to be sufficiently complex that it cannot be explained by any single mechanism. The extent of tolerance and the rate at which it develops vary widely between individuals, and even within one person. It is highly dependent on dosage, duration of use, and frequency of administration. Tolerance to the awakening effect of amphetamines does not readily develop, making them suitable for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]].<ref name="GhodseBehavior">{{Cite book| last = Ghodse | first = Hamid | title = Drugs and Addictive Behaviour: A Guide to Treatment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 114 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=3WF79shLxB4C&lpg=PA114&pg=PA114#v=onepage | isbn = 978-0-521-00001-7 | date = 2002-08-15 }}</ref>

Short-term tolerance can be caused by depleted levels of [[neurotransmitters]] within the [[synaptic vesicle]]s available for release into the [[synaptic cleft]] following subsequent reuse ([[tachyphylaxis]]). Short-term tolerance typically lasts until neurotransmitter levels are fully replenished; because of the toxic effects on dopaminergic neurons, this can be greater than 2–3 days. Prolonged overstimulation of [[dopamine receptors]] caused by methamphetamine may eventually cause the receptors to [[downregulation|downregulate]] in order to compensate for increased levels of [[dopamine]] within the synaptic cleft.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bennett |first=B.A. |last2=Hollingsworth| first2=C.K. |last3=Martin |first3 = R.S. |last4=Harp |first4= J.J. |title=Methamphetamine-induced alterations in dopamine transporter function |journal=Brain Research |volume=782 |issue=1-2 |pages=219–27 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9519266|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)01281-X}}</ref> To compensate, larger quantities of the drug are needed in order to achieve the same level of effects.

[[Reverse tolerance]] or sensitization can also occur.<ref name="GhodseBehavior"/> The effect is well established, but the mechanism is not well understood.

== Adverse effects ==

=== Addiction ===

Methamphetamine is highly [[Substance use disorder|addictive]].<ref>[http://www.camh.net/About_Addiction_Mental_Health/Drug_and_Addiction_Information/methamphetamine_dyk.htmlDo You Know... Methamphetamine]. Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.</ref> While the withdrawal itself may not be dangerous, [[withdrawal symptoms]] are common with heavy use and [[relapse]] is common.

Methamphetamine-induced hyperstimulation of pleasure pathways can lead to [[anhedonia]] months after use has been discontinued. Investigation of treatments targeting [[dopamine]] signalling such as [[bupropion]], or psychological treatments that raise hedonic tone, such as [[behavioral activation]] therapy, have been suggested.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Anhedonia and Amotivation in Psychiatric Outpatients with Fully Remitted Stimulant Use Disorder|author=Adam M. Leventhal|journal=Am J Addict|year=2008|volume=17|issue=3|pages=218–223|pmc=2650808|pmid=18463999| doi=10.1080/10550490802019774}}</ref> It is possible that daily administration of the amino acids <small>L</small>-[[tyrosine]] and [[5-HTP|<small>L</small>-5HTP]]/[[tryptophan]] can aid in the recovery process by making it easier for the body to reverse the depletion of dopamine, [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Although studies involving the use of these amino acids have shown some success, this method of recovery has not been shown to be consistently effective. {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

It is shown that taking [[ascorbic acid]] prior to using methamphetamine may help reduce acute toxicity to the brain, as rats given the human equivalent of 5–10&nbsp; grams of ascorbic acid 30 minutes prior to methamphetamine dosage had toxicity mediated,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wagner GC, Carelli RM, Jarvis MF|title=Pretreatment with ascorbic acid attenuates the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine in rats|journal=Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=221–8|year=1985 |month=February |pmid=3992009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wagner GC, Carelli RM, Jarvis MF|title=Ascorbic acid reduces the dopamine depletion induced by methamphetamine and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium ion |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=559–61 |year=1986 |month=May|pmid=3488515 |doi=10.1016/0028-3908(86)90184-X}}</ref> yet this will likely be of little avail in solving the other serious behavioral problems associated with methamphetamine use and addiction that many users experience.

To combat addiction, doctors are beginning to use other forms of [[stimulants]] such as [[dextroamphetamine]], the dextrorotatory (right-handed) isomer of the [[amphetamine]] molecule, to break the addiction cycle in a method similar to the use of [[methadone]] in the treatment of [[heroin]] addicts.

Methamphetamine addiction is one of the most difficult forms of addictions to treat. [[Bupropion]], [[aripiprazole]], and [[baclofen]] have been employed to treat post-withdrawal cravings, although the success rate is low. [[Modafinil]] is somewhat more successful, but this is a Class IV scheduled drug. [[Ibogaine]] has been used with success in Europe, where it is a Class I drug and available only for scientific research. [[Mirtazapine]] has been reported useful in some small-population studies.<ref>AJ Giannini. ''Drugs of Abuse—Second Edition''. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Company, 1997.</ref>

As the [[phenethylamine]] [[phentermine]] is a constitutional isomer of methamphetamine, it has been suggested that it may be effective in treating methamphetamine addiction. Phentermine is a [[central nervous system]] stimulant that acts on dopamine and norepinephrine. When comparing (+)-amphetamine, (+/-)-ephedrine, and phentermine, one key difference among the three drugs is their selectivity for norepinephrine (NE) release vs. dopamine (DA) release. The NE/DA selectivity ratios for these drugs as determined ''in vitro'' [(EC(50) NE(-1))/(EC(50) DA(-1))] are (+/-)-ephedrine (18.6) > phentermine (6.7) > (+)-amphetamine (3.5).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphetamines.com/misc/baboon.html |title=Noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of (+)-amphetamine-like stimulants in the baboon Papio anubis|publisher=Amphetamines.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>

=== Meth mouth ===
{{Main|Meth mouth}}
Methamphetamine users and addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, a condition informally known as [[meth mouth]]. According to the [[American Dental Association]], meth mouth "is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), extended periods of poor [[oral hygiene]], frequent consumption of high-calorie, carbonated beverages and [[bruxism]] (teeth grinding and clenching)". Some reports have also speculated that the caustic nature of the drug is a contributing factor. Methamphetamine also has the potential to cause excessive cigarette smoking for users already smoking. This combined with the methamphetamine can perpetuate the "meth mouth".<ref name="ADA">{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp |title=Methamphetamine Use (Meth Mouth)|accessdate=2006-12-16 |publisher=American Dental Association |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080601035323/http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp |archivedate = 2008-06-01}}</ref><ref name="snorting">{{cite web|url=http://www.mappsd.org/Meth%20Mouth.htm |title=Meth Mouth &#124; Meth awareness and prevention project of South Dakota |publisher=Mappsd.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref> Similar, though far less severe, symptoms have been reported in clinical use of regular amphetamine, where effects are not exacerbated by extended periods of poor oral hygiene.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hasan AA, Ciancio S |title=Relationship between amphetamine ingestion and gingival enlargement |journal=Pediatric Dentistry |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=396–400 |year=2004|pmid=15460293 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0164-1263&volume=26&issue=5&spage=396&aulast=Hasan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Shaner JW |title=Caries associated with methamphetamine abuse |journal=The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=42–7 |year=2002 |month=September|pmid=12271905}}</ref>

=== Public health issues ===

[[File:Meth lab trash central IA.jpg|thumb|250px|Waste left behind from a methamphetamine lab]]

Short-term exposure to high concentrations of chemical vapors that may exist in black market methamphetamine laboratories can cause severe health problems or even result in death. Exposure to these substances can occur from volatile air emissions, spills, fires, and explosions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5414a3.htm |title=Acute Public Health Consequences of Methamphetamine Laboratories &#124; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> Such methamphetamine labs are often discovered when fire fighters respond to a blaze. Methamphetamine cooks, their families, and first responders are at highest risk of acute health effects from chemical exposure, including lung damage and chemical burns to the body. Following a seizure of a methamphetamine lab, there is often a low exposure risk to chemical residues, however this contamination should be sanitized. Chemical residues and lab wastes that are left behind at a former methamphetamine lab can result in severe health problems for people who use the property, therefore local health departments should thoroughly assess the property for hazards prior to allowing it to be reinhabited, especially by children. Those seeking home ownership in heavy meth use areas should be especially careful while house hunting and be sure to have properties inspected before purchasing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=23154768 |title=How to avoid buying a meth house |accessdate=2011-08-16|publisher= MSN Real Estate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/clandestine120704HC-WI/clandestine120704HC-WI.pdf |title=Health Consultation |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-01-09 |publisher= Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (ATSDR)}}</ref>

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===

Methamphetamine present in a mother's [[bloodstream]] passes through the [[placenta]] to a [[fetus]], and is also secreted into [[breast milk]]. Infants born to methamphetamine-abusing mothers were found to have a significantly smaller [[gestational]] age-adjusted head circumference and birth weight measurements. Methamphetamine exposure was also associated with [[neonatal withdrawal]] symptoms of agitation, vomiting and [[tachypnea]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chomchai C, Na Manorom N, Watanarungsan P, Yossuck P, Chomchai S|pmid=15272773 |title=Methamphetamine abuse during pregnancy and its health impact on neonates born at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. &#124; PubMed|publisher=|date=2010-12-08|volume=35|issue=1|journal=Southeast Asian J.

=== Risk of sexually transmitted disease ===
{{See also|Sexually transmitted disease|Sex and drugs|Party and play}}

Men who use methamphetamine, [[cocaine]], [[MDMA]], and [[ketamine]], are twice as likely to have unprotected sex than those who do not use such drugs, according to British research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1974.html|title=Up to 20 per cent of gay men have tried crystal meth |publisher=PinkNews |date=2006-07-14|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> American [[psychologist]] [[Perry N. Halkitis]] performed an analysis using data collected from community-based participants among gay and bisexual men to examine the associations between their methamphetamine use and sexual risk taking behaviors. Methamphetamine use was found to be related to higher frequencies of unprotected sexual intercourse in both HIV-positive and unknown casual partners in the study population. The association between methamphetamine use and unprotected acts were also more pronounced in HIV-positive participants. These findings suggested that methamphetamine use and engagement in unprotected anal intercourse are co-occurring risk behaviors that potentially heighten the risk of HIV transmission among gay and bisexual men.<ref>{{Cite journal

Methamphetamine allows users of both sexes to engage in prolonged sexual activity, which may cause genital sores and abrasions. Methamphetamine can also cause sores and abrasions in the mouth via bruxism (teeth clenching and grinding), which can turn typically low-risk sex acts, such as oral sex, into high-risk sexual activity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patrick Moore|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-06-14/people/we-are-not-ok/ |title=We Are Not OK|publisher=VillageVoice |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]], blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted.

=== Detection in biological fluids ===

Methamphetamine and amphetamine are often measured in urine, sweat or saliva as part of a drug-abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Chiral techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether obtained legally (via prescription) or illicitly, or possibly as a result of formation from a prodrug such as famprofazone or selegiline. Chiral separation is needed to assess the possible contribution of l-methamphetamine (Vicks Inhaler) toward a positive test result.<ref>de la Torre R, Farré M, Navarro M, Pacifici R, Zuccaro P, Pichini S.

== Pharmacology ==

A member of the family of [[phenethylamine]]s, methamphetamine is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], with two [[isomer]]s, [[levorotatory]] and [[dextrorotatory]].<ref name="Schep"/> The levorotatory form, called [[levomethamphetamine]], is an [[over-the-counter drug]] used in [[inhaler]]s for nasal decongestion. Levomethamphetamine (a [[levoamphetamine]] derivative) does not possess any significant central nervous system activity or [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] properties. This article deals only with the dextrorotatory form, called dextromethamphetamine, and the [[racemic]] form.

Methamphetamine is a potent central nervous system [[stimulant]] that affects neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood and emotional responses associated with alertness or alarming conditions.<ref name="Schep"/> The acute physical effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an [[epinephrine]]-provoked [[fight-or-flight response]], including increased heart rate and blood pressure, [[vasoconstriction]] (constriction of the arterial walls), [[Bronchodilator|bronchodilation]], and [[hyperglycemia]] (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite. It is known to produce central effects similar to the other [[stimulants]], but at smaller doses, with fewer [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral effects]].<ref name="turningpoint.org. au"/> Methamphetamine's [[lipophilicity|fat solubility]] also allows it to enter the brain faster than other stimulants, where it is more stable against degradation by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO).

[[File:methamphetamine2.png|thumb|300px|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the methamphetamine molecule]]

The [[methyl group]] is responsible for the potentiation of effects as compared to the related compound [[amphetamine]], rendering the substance more lipid-soluble, enhancing transport across the [[blood–brain barrier]], and more stable against enzymatic degradation by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO). Methamphetamine causes the norepinephrine, dopamine, and [[serotonin]] (5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse (releasing monoamines in rats with ratios of about NE:DA = 1:2, NE: [[5HT]] = 1:60), causing increased stimulation of post-synaptic receptors. Methamphetamine also indirectly prevents the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, causing them to remain in the synaptic cleft for a prolonged period (inhibiting monoamine reuptake in rats with ratios of about: NE:DA = 1:2.35, NE:5HT = 1:44.5).<ref>Rothman, et al. "Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Potently than they Release Dopamine and Serotonin. " (2001): Synapse ''39'', 32-41 (Table V. on page 37)</ref> Methamphetamine also interacts with [[TAAR1]] to trigger phosphorylation of [[protein kinase A|PKA]] and [[protein kinase C|PKC]], ultimately resulting in the internalization of [[dopamine transporter]]s.<ref name="Xie and Miller 2009">{{cite pmid|19364908}}</ref> The presynaptic cell is less able to effectively remove dopamine from the synapse.

== Routes of administration ==

[[File:Methpipe.jpg|thumb|250px|Glass pipe used for smoking methamphetamine]]

Studies have shown that the subjective pleasure of drug use (the reinforcing component of addiction) is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases. These findings suggest the route of administration used affects the potential risk for psychological addiction independently of other risk factors, such as dosage and frequency of use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf |title=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (JPET) &#124; Onset of Action and Drug Reinforcement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion), [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting), and [[ingestion]] (swallowing). Ingestion does not produce a [[Rush (psychology)|rush]], an [[wikt:acute|acute]] [[wikt:transcendent|transcendent]] state of euphoria as forerunner to the high experienced with the use of methamphetamine, which is most pronounced with the intravenous route of administration. Whilst the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abstemious.org/Meth.htm |title=Methamphetamine &#124; Abstemious Outpatient Clinic, Inc |publisher=Abstemious.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref>

=== Injection ===

[[Drug injection|Injection]] carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. The hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is soluble in water. Intravenous users may use any dose range, from less than 100 [[milligram]]s to over one [[gram]], using a [[hypodermic needle]], although it should be noted that typically street methamphetamine is "cut," or diluted, with a water-soluble cutting material, which constitutes a significant portion of a given street methamphetamine dose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elkhorn.unl.edu/epublic/live/g1748/build/g1748.pdf |title=Methamphetamine: One of America's Greatest Challenges Part I &#124; University of Nebraska-Lincoln |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref> Intravenous users risk developing [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE), a blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches, and commonly develop skin rashes (also known as "speed bumps") or infections at the site of injection. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as HIV or hepatitis, can be transmitted.

=== Smoking ===

Smoking amphetamines refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, not burning it to inhale the resulting smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from [[glassblowing|glassblown]] [[Pyrex|Pyrex tubes]] and light bulbs. It can also be smoked off aluminium foil, which is heated underneath by a flame. This method is also known as "chasing the ''white'' dragon" (whereas smoking [[heroin]] is known as "[[chasing the dragon]]").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokingmeth.net/ |title=Smoking Meth, the beginner and expert guide to chase the white dragon |publisher=Smokingmeth.Net |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biopsychiatry.com/heroin.htm |title=Heroin: a history of chasing the dragon |publisher=Biopsychiatry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref> There is little evidence that methamphetamine inhalation results in greater toxicity than any other route of administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Methamphetamine_Toxicity_Secondary_to_Intravaginal_Body_Stuffing.pdf |title=Methamphetamine Toxicity Secondary to Intravaginal Body Stuffing &#124; University of Hawaii System |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://addiction.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Short_Term_Effects_of_Smoking_Crystal_Meth |title=Short Term Effects of Smoking Crystal Meth &#124; LoveToKnow Recovery |publisher=Addiction. lovetoknow.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> Lung damage has been reported with long-term use, but manifests in forms independent of route ([[pulmonary hypertension]] (PH)), or limited to injection users ([[pulmonary embolism]] (PE)).

=== Insufflation ===

Another popular route of administration to intake methamphetamine is insufflation (snorting). This method allows methamphetamine to be absorbed through the soft tissue of the [[mucous membrane]] in the [[sinus cavity]], and then directly into the bloodstream, bypassing [[first-pass metabolism]].

=== Suppository ===

[[Suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion) is a less popular method of administration used in the community with comparatively little research into its effects.<ref name="Foobar">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/publishing.nsf/Content/mono69-l~mono69-l-ch1~mono69-l-ch1.9 |title=National Drug Strategy - 1.9 Routes of administration &#124; Department of Health and Ageing |publisher=Health.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref> Information on its use is largely anecdotal with reports of increased sexual pleasure and the effects of the drug lasting longer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alltreatment.com/meth-addiction/meth-facts |title=Meth Facts |publisher=All Treatment |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref> though as methamphetamine is centrally active in the brain, these effects are likely experienced through the higher bioavailability of the drug in the bloodstream (second to injection) and the faster onset of action (than insufflation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6SYR-48362JR-1HS&_user=10&_coverDate=01/01/1987&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1623447584&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=1424ffb9a560445ad5fa52c2e96b4c36&searchtype=a |title=Ascorbic acid-deficient condition alters central effects of methamphetamine |publisher=ScienceDirect |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref> Nicknames for the route of administration within some methamphetamine communities include a "butt rocket", a "booty bump", "potato thumping", "turkey basting", "plugging", "boofing", "suitcasing", "hooping", "keistering", "shafting", "bumming", and "shelving" (vaginal).<ref name="Foobar"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/ |title=Urban Dictionary |publisher=Urban Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Blue Crystal Meth .jpg|thumb|[[crystalline|Crystal]] methamphetamine was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in 1919 by [[Akira Ogata]]]]

The experiment failed because soldiers became agitated, could not channel their aggression and showed impaired judgment.<ref name="history" /> Rather, dextroamphetamine ([[Dexedrine]]) became the drug of choice for American bomber pilots, being used on a voluntary basis by roughly half of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilots during the [[Persian Gulf War]], a practice which came under some media scrutiny in 2003 after a mistaken attack on Canadian troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/01/04/MN191592.DTL|title='Go' pills for F-16 pilots get close look: Amphetamines prescribed in mission that killed Canadians|author=Greg Miller|date=2003-01-04|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

=== Medical and legal over-the-counter sales ===

Following the use of amphetamine (such as [[Benzedrine]], introduced 1932) in the 1930s for asthma, narcolepsy, and symptoms of the common cold,<ref name="history" /> in 1943, [[Abbott Laboratories]] requested U.S. FDA approval of methamphetamine for treatment of [[narcolepsy]], mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[postencephalitic parkinsonism]], chronic [[alcoholism]], cerebral [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Allergic rhinitis|hay fever]], which was granted in December 1944.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Philips claimed the exclusive right to use the trademark as a [[portmanteau]] of Philips and Nippon, the Japanese name of the country. DSP's attorneys challenged Philips' standing to sue as a foreign (Dutch) corporation. The matter was ultimately settled out of court in 1952, with Dainippon Pharmaceuticals agreeing to pay Philips a 5% royalty on worldwide sales of methamphetamines sold by DSP under the Philopon label. The Japanese Ministry of Health banned production less than a year later.<ref name="banning_in_1951"/>

In the 1950s, there was a rise in the legal prescription of methamphetamine to the American public. In the 1954 edition of ''Pharmacology and Therapeutics'', indications for methamphetamine included "[[narcolepsy]], [[Encephalitis|postencephalitic]] [[parkinsonism]], alcoholism, certain depressive states, and in the treatment of [[obesity]]."<ref>{{Cite book| last = Grollman | first = Arthur | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pharmacology and Therapeutics: a Textbook for Students and Practitioners of Medicine | publisher = Lea & Febiger | year = 1954 | location = | page = 209 | isbn = 0-8121-0105-7}}</ref> Methamphetamine constituted half of the amphetamine salts for the original formulation for the diet drug [[Obetrol]], which later became the [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] drug [[Adderall]]. Methamphetamine was also marketed for sinus inflammation or for non-medicinal purposes as "[[pep pills]]" or "bennies".<ref name="history" />

=== Recreational use and prohibitive regulations ===

In 1950 the Japanese Ministry of Health banned stimulant production, but drug companies continued to produce stimulants and they wound up on the black market. From 1951 to 1954 a series of acts were passed by the Japanese government to try to stop production and sale of stimulants; however, the production and sale of stimulant drugs continued through criminal syndicates such as [[Yakuza]] criminal organizations.<ref name=banning_in_1951>{{cite web| url =http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1989-01-01_1_page007.html | title = Japan: stimulant epidemics past and present | accessdate = 14 July 2006 | first= M. |last=Tamura | date= 1989-01-01 |work = Bulletin on Narcotics | publisher = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | pages = 83–93}}</ref> On the streets, it is also known as S, Shabu, and Speed, in addition to its old trademarked name.

The 1960s saw the start of significant use of clandestinely manufactured methamphetamine, most of which was produced by [[motorcycle gangs]]. It was also prescribed by San Franciscan drug clinics to treat heroin addiction.<ref name="history" /> Beginning in the 1990s, the production of methamphetamine in users' own homes for personal and recreational use became popular.

In 1970, methamphetamine was regulated in the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in the U. S., and a public education campaign was mounted against it.<ref name="history" />

By the 2000s, the only two FDA approved marketing indications remaining for methamphetamine were for [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and the short-term management of [[exogenous obesity]], although the drug is clinically established as effective in the treatment of narcolepsy.<ref name="Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK 1993 306–17">{{Cite journal|author=Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK |title=Treatment of narcolepsy with methamphetamine |journal=Sleep |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=306–17 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8341891|pmc=2267865}}</ref>

In 1983, laws were passed in the United States prohibiting possession of precursors and equipment for methamphetamine production. This was followed a month later by a bill passed in Canada enacting similar laws. In 1986, the U.S. government passed the Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act in an attempt to curb the growing use of [[designer drug]]s. Despite this, use of methamphetamine expanded from its initial base in California throughout the rural United States, especially through the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Southern United States|South]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/209730.pdf |title=Methamphetamine Use: Lessons Learned|publisher=National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS)|format=PDF |date=|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>

== Illicit production ==

=== Synthesis ===
[[File:Methamphetamine.jpg|250px|thumb|Illicitly synthesized crystal methamphetamine]]
{{see also|Substituted amphetamine#Synthesis}}

Methamphetamine is most structurally similar to [[methcathinone]] and amphetamine. Synthesis is relatively simple, but entails risk with flammable and corrosive chemicals, particularly the solvents used in extraction and purification; therefore, illicit production is often discovered by fires and explosions caused by the improper handling of volatile or flammable solvents. The six major routes of production begin with either [[phenyl-2-propanone]] (P2P) or with one of the isomeric compounds [[pseudoephedrine]] and [[ephedrine]].<ref name="Remberg">{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1999-01-01_1_page008.html|title=Drug characterization/impurity profiling, with special focus on methamphetamine: recent work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme|author=B.

S. Department of Justice|author=National Drug Intelligence Center}}</ref>

The alternative Leuckart route also relies on P2P to produce a racemic product, but proceeds via [[methylformamide]] in [[formic acid]] to an intermediate N-formyl-methamphetamine, which is then decarboxylated with [[hydrochloric acid]].<ref name="Remberg" /><ref name="Makino" />

Two infrequently used reductive amination routes have also been reported. The "nitropropene route", in which [[benzaldehyde]] is condensed with [[nitroethane]] to produce 1-phenyl-2-nitropropene, which is subsequently reduced by [[hydrogenation]] of the double bond and reduction of the [[nitro group]] using hydrogen over a palladium catalyst or [[lithium aluminum hydride]]. The "oxime route" reacts phenyl-2-propanol with [[hydroxylamine]] to produce an oxime intermediate which likewise is hydrogenated using hydrogen over a [[palladium]] catalyst or lithium aluminum hydride.<ref name="UNODC2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/scientific/stnar34.pdf|title=Recommended methods of the identification and analysis of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and their ring-substituted analogues in seized materials|year=2006|publisher=UNODC}}</ref>

Illicit methamphetamine is more commonly made by the [[Redox|reduction]] of [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]], which produces the more active d-methamphetamine isomer. The maximum conversion rate for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is 92%, although typically, illicit methamphetamine laboratories convert at a rate of 50% to 75%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~cdobkin/Papers/Methamphetamine.pdf |title=The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime &#124; University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> Most methods of illicit production involve [[protonation]] of the [[hydroxyl]] group on the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine molecule.

[[File:Methamphetamine from ephedrine via chloroephedrine en.png|thumb|250px|[[Thionyl chloride]] synthesis]]

The conceptually similar Emde route involves reduction of ephedrine to chloroephedrine using [[thionyl chloride]] (SOCl<sub>2</sub>), followed by [[Catalysis|catalytic]] [[hydrogenation]]. The catalysts for this reaction are [[palladium]] or [[platinum]].<ref name="Remberg" /><ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0379-0738(89)90086-8|author = Andrew Allen and Thomas S.

The [[Birch reduction]], also called the "Nazi method", became popular in the mid-to-late 1990s and comprised the bulk of methamphetamine production in Michigan in 2002.<ref name="Michigan" /> It reacts pseudoephedrine with liquid [[anhydrous ammonia]] and an alkali metal such as [[sodium]] or [[lithium]]. The reaction is allowed to stand until the ammonia evaporates.<ref name="UNODC2006" /> However, the Birch reduction is dangerous because the alkali metal and ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added. It has been the most popular method in [[Midwest]]ern states of the U. S. because of the ready availability of liquid ammonia fertilizer in farming regions.<ref name="mappsd">{{cite web|url=http://www.mappsd.org/Types%20of%20Labs.htm|title=Types of Meth Labs|publisher=METH Awareness and Prevention Project of South Dakota}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General &#124; Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>

In recent years, a simplified "Shake 'n Bake" [[one-pot synthesis]] has become more popular. The method is suitable for such small batches that pseudoephedrine restrictions are less effective, it uses chemicals that are easier to obtain (though no less dangerous than traditional methods), and it is so easy to carry out that some addicts have made the drug while driving.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2009/08/25/2009-08-25_new_method_for_making_crystal_meth_gets_around_drug_laws.html |title=New 'shake-and-bake' method for making crystal meth gets around drug laws but is no less dangerous |agency=Associated Press |publisher=New York Daily News |date=August 25, 2009}}</ref> It involves placing crushed pseudoephedrine tablets into a nonpressurized container containing [[ammonium nitrate]], water, and a [[hydrophobic]] solvent such as [[Coleman fuel]]<ref name="Ziegelman">{{cite web|url=http://packet-media.com/2011/02/03/meth-lab-busted-on-warpath/|title=Meth Lab Busted on Warpath|author=Evan Ziegelman|publisher=The Columbus Packet|date=2011-02-03}}</ref> or automotive [[starting fluid]], to which [[lye]] and [[lithium]] (from [[lithium batteries]]) is added. [[Hydrogen chloride]] gas produced by a reaction of salt with [[sulfuric acid]] is then used to recover crystals for purification.

Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine for the U.S. market was made mostly in labs run by drug traffickers in [[Mexico]] and California. [[Indiana]] [[state police]] found 1,260 labs in 2003, compared to just 6 in 1995, although this may be partly a result of increased police activity.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.in.gov/cji/methfreeindiana/enforce.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225227/http://www.in.gov/cji/methfreeindiana/enforce.html |archivedate=2007-09-22 |title=Law Enforcement Facts |year=2007 |publisher=Indiana State Government |location=U.S.}}</ref> As of 2007, drug and lab seizure data suggests that approximately 80 percent of the methamphetamine used in the United States originates from larger laboratories operated by Mexican-based syndicates on both sides of the border and that approximately 20 percent comes from small toxic labs (STLs) in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book

Mobile and motel-based methamphetamine labs have caught the attention of both the U. S. news media and the police. Such labs can cause explosions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOdE_iQawUw&feature=related|title=Meth Explosion Caught On Tape|author=Tiffany Craig|publisher=YouTube (WKRGNews)}}</ref> and fires and expose the public to hazardous chemicals. Those who manufacture methamphetamine are often harmed by toxic gases. Many police departments have specialized task forces with training to respond to cases of methamphetamine production. The National Drug Threat Assessment 2006, produced by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], found "decreased domestic methamphetamine production in both small and large-scale laboratories", but also that "decreases in domestic methamphetamine production have been offset by increased production in Mexico." The report concluded that "methamphetamine availability is not likely to decline in the near term. "<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs11/18862/meth.htm |title=Methamphetamine | National Drug Threat Assessment 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date = January 2006|publisher=National Drug Intelligence Center }}</ref>

Methamphetamine labs can give off noxious fumes, such as [[phosphine]] gas, [[methylamine]] gas, solvent vapors, [[acetone]] or [[chloroform]], iodine vapors, white phosphorus, anhydrous [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen chloride]]/[[muriatic acid]], hydrogen iodide, lithium and [[sodium]] gases, [[ether]], or methamphetamine vapors.<ref name="Michigan" /><!-- - note this ref only covers red P method, not all of the other stuff- --> If performed by amateurs, manufacturing methamphetamine can be extremely dangerous. If the red phosphorus overheats, because of a lack of ventilation, phosphine gas can be produced. This gas is highly toxic and, if present in large quantities, is likely to explode upon autoignition from [[diphosphine]], which is formed by overheating phosphorus. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In July 2007, Mexican officials at the port of [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]] seized a ship carrying 19 tons of pseudoephedrine, a raw material needed for methamphetamine.<ref>[http://www.thetelegram.com/index.cfm?pid=1154&cpcat=world&stry=59519030 Mexico says pseudoephedrine case signals breakdown in port security in U.S., China]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} AP, The Telegram (The Canadian Press), July 26, 2007. Olga R. Rodriguez</ref> The shipment originated in [[Hong Kong]] and passed through the United States at the port of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] prior to its arrival in Mexico.

=== Impurities and adulterants ===

In Japan, methamphetamine seizures are usually white crystals of high purity, but contain impurities that vary according to the means of production, and are sometimes adulterated.

Diagnostic impurities are the [[naphthalene]]s 1-benzyl-methylnaphthalene and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenylnaphthalene,<ref name="Cantrell" /> arising in the Nagai and Leuckart routes, and ''cis-'' or ''trans-'' 1,2-dimethyl-3-phenylaziridine, ephedrine, or erythro-3,4-dimethyl-
5-phenyloxazolidine, arising in the Nagai and Emde routes; these are absent in the reductive amination route.<ref name="Makino" /> Characteristic impurities of the Birch route include N-methyl-1-(1-(1,4-cyclohexadienyl))-2-propanamine.<ref name="UNODC2006" /> Methamphetamine produced by the Birch route contains phenyl-2-propanone, the precursor for the reductive amination route, as a degradation product.<ref name="Cantrell" /> However, specific diagnostic impurities are not very reliable in practice, and it is generally preferable for forensic technicians to evaluate a larger profile of trace compounds.<ref name="Remberg" />

A common adulterant is [[dimethyl sulfone]], a solvent and cosmetic base without known effect on the nervous system; other adulterants include [[dimethylamphetamine]] HCl, ephedrine HCl, [[sodium thiosulfate]], [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium glutamate]], and a mixture of [[caffeine]] with [[sodium benzoate]].<ref name="Inoue" />

In the United States, illicit methamphetamine comes in a variety of forms with prices varying widely over time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/price_purity/ |title=The Price and Purity of Illicit Drugs: 1981 Through the Second Quarter of 2003 |publisher=WhiteHouseDrugPolicy.gov |month=November |year=2004 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051027062908/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/price_purity/ |archivedate=2005-10-27}}</ref> Most commonly, it is found as a colorless [[wikt:crystalline|crystalline]] solid. Impurities may result in a brownish or tan color. Colorful flavored pills containing methamphetamine and [[caffeine]] are known as [[yaba (drug)|yaa baa]] (Thai for "crazy medicine").

An impure form of methamphetamine is sold as a crumbly brown or off-white rock, commonly referred to as "peanut butter crank".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ice Epidemic |url=http://www.wctu.com.au/pages/education_papers/Education+Paper+2007-09.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080719104248/http://www.wctu.com.au/pages/education_papers/Education+Paper+2007-09.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-19 |publisher=Woman's Christian Temperance Union |location=Australia |work=WCTU.com.au |first=Glenda |last=Amos |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> It may be diluted or [[cutting agent|cut]] with non-psychoactive substances like [[inositol]], [[isopropylbenzylamine]] or [[dimethylsulfone]]. Another popular method is to combine methamphetamine with other [[stimulant|stimulant substances]], such as caffeine or [[cathine]], into a pill known as a "Kamikaze", which can be particularly dangerous due to the [[synergistic|synergistic effects]] of multiple stimulants. Reports in 2007 of the appearance of flavored "[[Strawberry Quik meth myth|Strawberry Quik meth]]" circulated in the media and local law enforcement,<ref>{{cite web|first=Lloyd |last=De Vries|date=May 2, 2007 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/02/health/main2752266.shtml |title=Candy Flavored Meth Targets New Users| work= CBS News |accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref> but were debunked in 2010 by the DEA, although meth of varying ''colors'' has been seized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/drugs/candymeth.asp |title=Strawberry Meth |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=2009-08-25 |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara }}</ref>

Rarely, the impure reaction mixture from the hydrogen iodide/red phosphorus route is used without further modification, usually by injection; it is called "ox blood".<ref name="UNODC2006" /> "Meth oil" refers to the crude methamphetamine base produced by several synthesis procedures. Ordinarily it is purified by exposure to hydrogen chloride, as a solution or as a bubbled gas, and extraction of the resulting salt occurs by precipitation and/or recrystallization with ether/acetone.<ref name="UNODC2006" />

=== Slang terms ===

[[Slang|Slang terms]] for methamphetamine, especially common among illicit users, are numerous and vary from region to region. Some names are "crystal meth", "meth", "speed", "crystal", "ice",<ref name="ReachOut">{{cite web|url=http://au.reachout.com/find/articles/ice-crystal-methamphetamine-hydrochloride|title=Ice |publisher=reachout.com| date=2010-09-06 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}</ref> "shard", "p", "shabu/shaboo", "glass", "crank", "batu/batunas", "scanté", "rizz", "rock", "tina" and "cold". Some terms vary by region or subculture.

Some regional terms are based on the original trade names; thus "필로폰" ("Pilopon") in [[South Korea]], "Пико" for pure methamphetamine in [[Bulgaria]] or "piko" in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]] after the trade name "Pervitin". Also "peří" ("feathers", phonetically similar to "Pervitin") and "perník" ("gingerbread", phonetically similar to "Pervitin" in the Czech Republic. In New Zealand it is called "''P''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/safety/meth.html |title=What is methamphetamine? &#124; New Zealand Police |publisher=Police.govt.nz |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>

Other local names include “冰毒” (''Bīng Dú'', Chinese for "Ice drug") in China, "[[ya ba]]" (Thai for "Crazy Medicine", [[Thailand]]), "ya ice" (Thai for "Ice drug", [[Thailand]]), "đá" (Vietnamese for "ice", [[Vietnam]]), "batu kilat" (Malaysian for "shining rocks", [[Malaysia]]),<ref name=nicknames>{{cite web|url=http://www.methhelponline.com/meth-slang.htm |title=Meth Slang Names for Meth, Meth Jargon &#124; Meth Addiction and Recovery |publisher=Methhelponline.com |date=2007-02-09 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> "bato" (Filipino for "rock" or "stone", [[Philippines]])<ref name="nicknames"/> "شیشه" (in translation "Glass", transliterate to "Shishe", [[Iran]]), "tik" ([[South Africa]]),<ref name="UCT">{{Cite news|work=UCT|accessdate=2009-08-13 |last=Plüddemann|first=Andreas| date=2005-06|title=Tik, memory loss and stroke|journal=Science in Africa|publisher=Science magazine for Africa CC|location=South Africa|url=http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2005/june/tik.htm}}</ref> "dimineata speciala aurie" ("Special golden morning", [[Romania]]), "bala" in [[Brazilian Portuguese]], "tjäck" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], "ספיד" in [[Israel]] and "Teeft" [[United Kingdom]].

"Vint", Russian for "a screw", specifically refers to a very impure homemade form of methamphetamine in [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugtext.org/count/Russia_drugtext_ENG.htm |title=Drugs and HIV infection in the Russian Federation |last1= Smirnov |first1=Alexander |date=March–April, 2001 |publisher=drugtext foundation |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090501065749/http://www.drugtext.org/count/Russia_drugtext_ENG.htm |archivedate=1 May 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>
