A '''leech collector''', '''leech gatherer''', or '''leech finder''' was a person occupied with procuring [[Hirudo medicinalis|medicinal leeches]], which were in growing demand in 19th-century Europe.  Leeches were used in [[bloodletting]] but were not easy for medical practitioners to obtain.  The collector would sometimes gather the leeches by attracting them to the legs of animals, often old horses.  More commonplace was for the collector to use their own legs, gathering the leech after it had finished sucking enough blood.  Many in the profession suffered from the effects of the [[bleeding|loss of blood]] and infections spread by the leeches.<ref name="SM">[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/leechcollectors.aspx Leech collectors], [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]].

Leech collectors were active across the United Kingdom, with [[bog]]s and [[marsh]]es being the best hunting ground.  The [[Lake District]] and [[Somerset Levels]] had particularly suitable sites.  They were described by artist [[George Walker (painter)|George Walker]] in his 1814 book ''The Costume of Yorkshire'' as being predominately Scottish women.<ref name="TR">[[Tony Robinson|Robinson, Tony]]. ''[[The Worst Jobs in History]]''. Pan. ISBN 0-330-43857-3 p.54â€“56.</ref>

The career was seasonal; leech collectors could not work in the colder months because the leeches would not be particularly active.<ref name="TR" />

There are obvious negative effects of being repeatedly bitten by leeches, most commonly the significant and dangerous levels of blood loss.  The leeches would suck on the legs of the collector for 20 minutes or more, and even when they had finished the resultant wound continued to bleed for up to ten hours.<ref name="TR" />

Leech collectors were not well paid.  [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem ''[[Resolution and Independence]]'', written in 1802 and published in 1807, was inspired by an encounter Wordsworth had with a "leech-gatherer".<ref>Wordsworth, Dorothy. ''The Grasmere Journals''. Edited by Pamela Woof. Oxford University Press, 1991.</ref>  In Stanza XV he describes the hardships that the old, poor leech collector had endured:

{{quotation|
He told, that to these waters he had come<br />
To gather leeches, being old and poor:<br />
Employment hazardous and wearisome!<br />
And he had many hardships to endure:<br />
From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;<br />
Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance,<br />
And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.}}

Parts of the poem have been interpreted as drawing similarities between leech collectors and poets,<ref>[http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/wordsworth/themes.html Wordsworth's Poetry]. [[SparkNotes]]. Accessed 2 September 2011.</ref> comparing the difficulties of finding leeches with the struggle to write poetry.<ref>Durrant, Geoffrey. ''William Wordsworth''. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-07608-0. 1 September 1969. p. 95</ref>  The old man in the story is said to "have wisdom and fortitude that can elevate the wiser poet".<ref>Moore, Pamela.

==Decline==
''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'', the only species of leech in Britain that can suck human blood,<ref name="RMCP">[http://www.rmcp.co.uk/MedicinalLeech.html Medicinal Leech (Hirudo medicinalis) In the Romney Marsh Natural Area]. Romney Marsh Countryside Project. Accessed 2 September 2011.</ref> is identified as being "[[Near Threatened]]" by the [[IUCN]].  Their decline dates back to the time of the collectors and Wordsworth refers to the fall in their numbers in ''Resolution and Independence'' Stanza XVIII:

{{quotation|
He with a smile did then his words repeat;<br />
And said, that, gathering leeches, far and wide<br />
He travelled; stirring thus about his feet<br />
The waters of the pools where they abide.<br />
"Once I could meet with them on every side;<br />
But they have dwindled long by slow decay;<br />
Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may."}}

The collection of leeches became a sizeable industry by the mid-19th century: 30 million were exported from Germany to America annually and French imports of ''H. medicinalis'' in 1833 were in the region of 42 million.  By the turn of the 20th century ''H. medicinalis'' had disappeared from most of Europe and was declared extinct in the [[British Isles]], but they were rediscovered in parts of [[Great Britain]] from 1970 onwards.  The dramatic drop in numbers was blamed partly on the over-collection of the species but also on the dramatic reduction of their habitat.  The largest population currently in Britain is believed to reside in the [[Romney Marsh]].<ref name="RMCP" />

The leech collecting industry also declined as the medicinal value of using leeches was questioned.
