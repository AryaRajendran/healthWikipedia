There is a lack of medical consensus about whether moderate consumption of beer, wine, or distilled spirits has a stronger association with heart disease. Studies suggest that each is effective, with none having a clear advantage. Most researchers now believe that the most important ingredient is the alcohol itself.<ref name=Rimm96>{{cite journal |author=Rimm EB, Klatsky A, Grobbee D, Stampfer MJ |title=Review of moderate alcohol consumption and reduced risk of coronary heart disease: is the effect due to beer, wine, or spirits |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7033 |pages=731–6 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8605457 |pmc=2350477 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8605457}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Barefoot JC, Grønbæk M, Feaganes JR, McPherson RS, Williams RB, Siegler IC |title=Alcoholic beverage preference, diet, and health habits in the UNC Alumni Heart Study |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=466–472 |month=August  |year=2002 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/76/2/466 |pmid=12145024}}</ref>

The American Heart Association has reported that "More than a dozen prospective studies have demonstrated a consistent, strong, dose-response relation between increasing alcohol consumption and decreasing incidence of CHD (coronary heart disease). The data are similar in men and women in a number of different geographic and ethnic groups. Consumption of one or two drinks per day is associated with a reduction in risk of approximately 30% to 50%".<ref name=Pearson/>

Heart disease is the largest cause of mortality in the United States and many other countries. Therefore, some physicians have suggested that patients be informed of the potential health benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation, especially if they abstain and alcohol is not [[contraindication|contraindicated]]. Others, however, argue against the practice in fear that it might lead to heavy or abusive alcohol consumption. Heavy drinking is associated with a number of health and safety problems.

== Debate over research methods ==
=== Ex-drinkers versus never-drinkers ===
A logical possibility is that some of the alcohol abstainers in research studies previously drank excessively and had undermined their health, thus explaining their high levels of risk. To test this hypothesis, some studies {{who|date=March 2013}} have excluded all but those who had avoided alcohol for their entire lives. The conclusion remained the same in some studies: moderate drinkers are less likely to suffer heart disease. A paper concludes, "In this population of light to moderate drinkers, alcohol consumption in general was associated with decreased MI [myocardial infarction ] risk in women; however, episodic intoxication was related to a substantial increase in risk."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dorn JM, Hovey K, Williams BA, Freudenheim JL, Russell M, Nochajski TH, Trevisan M |title=Alcohol drinking pattern and non-fatal myocardial infarction in women |journal=Addiction |volume=102 |issue=5 |pages=730–9 |month=May |year=2007 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/add/2007/00000102/00000005/art00011 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01765.x |pmid=17506150}}</ref>

An analysis by sociologist Kaye Fillmore and colleagues failed to find significant support. Analyzing 54 prospective studies, the authors found that those studies which were free of the potential error (including former drinkers in the abstaining group) did not demonstrate significant cardiac protection from alcohol, although they continued to exhibit a J-shaped relationship in which moderate drinkers were less likely (but not at a statistically significantly level of confidence) to suffer cardiac disease than lifelong abstainers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fillmore KM, Kerr WC, Stockwell T, Chikritzhs T, Bostrom A |title=Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality risk: Systematic error in prospective studies  |journal=Addict Res Theory |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–132 |month=April |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/16066350500497983 |url=http://www.assbussola.netsons.org/doc/pub/alcol/bere_moderato_originale.pdf}}{{dead|date=March 2013}}</ref> The instructor of nursing says research is needed that looks at the reasons people abstain, which hers did not do.

Cardiologist Dr. Arthur Klatsky notes that Fillmore's study, which she freely acknowledges proves nothing but only raises questions, is itself seriously flawed. To overcome the inherent weaknesses of all epidemiological studies, even when properly conducted, he calls for a randomized trial in which some subjects are assigned to abstain while others are assigned to drink alcohol in moderation and the health of all is monitored for a period of years.<ref name="sfgate">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/30/MNGMTI0B3U1.DTL |title=UCSF points out flaw in studies tying alcohol to heart health | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Sabin | last=Russell | date=2010-08-28}}</ref>

This question of confusion of abstainers with previously heavy drinkers in epidemiologic studies is overcome with studies showing dose response effects.  That is, higher amounts of alcohol consumption seem associated with greater cardiovascular benefit. <ref>Prospective study of alcohol drinking patterns and coronary heart disease in women and men. Janne Tolstrup, Majken K Jensen, Tjønneland Anne, Kim Overvad, Kenneth J Mukamal, and Morten Grønbæk. BMJ 2006;332:1244.</ref>

===Studies on possible confounding effects===
Some have suggested the cardioprotective effects of alcohol consumption could be explained by confounding variables.  For example moderate drinkers might have more healthful lifestyles, higher economic status, better dietary habits, better healthcare, or higher educational levels, etc.  However, when these and other factors are considered, the cardioprotective effects of alcohol are still evident.<ref name=Pearson>Pearson, Thomas A.  "Alcohol and Heart Disease."  {{cite web|title=''Circulation'' 1996;94:3023-3025|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/11/3023|accessdate=2006-01-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060125022927/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/11/3023| archivedate= 25 January 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Confirmation of Cardioprotection===
Multiple studies on moderate alcohol consumption have now reconfirmed earlier suspected cardioprotection findings.  A 2006 study concluded, "Even in men already at low risk on the basis of body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and diet, moderate alcohol intake is associated with lower risk for MI [myocardial infarction]."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukamal KJ, Chiuve SE, Rimm EB |title=Alcohol Consumption and Risk for Coronary Heart Disease in Men With Healthy Lifestyles |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=166 |issue=19 |pages=2145–50 |year=2006 |url=http://archinte.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/166/19/2145 |doi=10.1001/archinte.166.19.2145 |pmid=17060546}}</ref>  Another study found that when men increased their alcohol intake from very low to moderate, they significantly reduced their risk of coronary heart disease. The study monitored the health of 18,455 males for a period of seven years.<ref name=Sesso>{{cite journal |author=Sesso HD, Stampfer MJ, Rosner B, Hennekens CH, Manson JE, Gaziano JM |title=Seven-Year Changes in Alcohol Consumption and Subsequent Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Men |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=160 |issue=17 |pages=2605–12 |year=2000 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/160/17/2605 |doi=10.1001/archinte.160.17.2605 |pmid=10999974}}</ref>  A multicenter randomized diet study published in 2013 included over 7000 persons at risk to develop cardiovascular disease, and found that a Mediterranean-diet, including an encouragement to daily wine consumption in habitual drinkers, led to decreased cardiovascular events by about 30%.  The study was halted prematurely since the health benefits were so dramatic.<ref> http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303 </ref>
