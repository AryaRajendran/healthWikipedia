'''Rapid sequence induction''' (RSI) is a [[medical procedure]] involving a prompt induction of [[general anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] and subsequent [[tracheal intubation|intubation of the trachea]]. RSI is typically used in an emergency setting or for patients in the [[operating room]].  RSI is most-commonly performed by [[physician]]s, [[respiratory therapist]]s and [[nurse anesthetist]]s.  [[Paramedic]]s in the pre-hospital setting also utilize RSI techniques when necessary.  RSI is a high-risk procedure where [[airway management]] is the primary purpose. The advantage of using rapid sequence induction is to quickly induce unconsciousness and cause paralysis which allow for easier tracheal intubation.  This also places the patient at a very high risk for respiratory compromise should the procedure be unsuccessful, since the paralysis also prevents the patient from protecting his own airway (the patient cannot "cough" or "gag").

== Common medications ==
Commonly used medications during a rapid sequence induction:

=== Sedation ===
* [[Midazolam]]
* [[Ketamine]]
* [[Fentanyl]]
* [[Thiopentone]]
* [[Propofol]]
* [[Etomidate]]

=== Paralytics ===
* [[Suxamethonium chloride|Suxamethonium]]
* [[Rocuronium]]
* [[Vecuronium bromide|Vecuronium]]

=== Other medications ===
* [[Atropine]] — For patients where [[bradycardia]] is a concern
* [[Metaraminol]] or [[ephedrine]], where [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) may occur secondary to the sedating drugs

==Technique==
Rapid sequence intubation refers to the pharmacologically induced [[sedation]] and [[neuromuscular paralysis]] prior to intubation of the trachea. The technique is a quicker form of the process normally used to induce [[general anesthesia]]. A useful framework for describing the technique of RSI is the "seven Ps".<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Angus|title=Rapid Sequence Intubation - A guide for assistants|url=http://www.scottishintensivecare.org.uk/education/RSI%20brochure.pdf|work=Scottish Intensive Care Society Education|publisher=NHS - Education for Scotland|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Preparation ===
The patient is assessed to predict the difficulty of intubation. Continuous physiological monitoring such as [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] and [[pulse oximetry]] is put on the patient. The equipment and drugs for the intubation are planned, including the endotracheal tube size, the laryngoscope size, and drug dosage. Drugs are prepared in syringes. [[Intravenous]] access is obtained to deliver the drugs, usually by placing one or two IV [[cannulae]].

===Preoxygenation===
The aim of preoxygenation is to replace the nitrogen that forms the majority of the [[functional residual capacity]] with oxygen. This provides an oxygen reservoir that will delay the depletion of oxygen in the absence of ventilation (after paralysis) for up to 8 minutes (to an oxygen saturation of 90%) in the healthy adult.<ref>{{cite pmid|9357902}}</ref> This time will be significantly reduced in obese patients, ill patients and children. Preoxygenation is usually performed by giving 100% oxygen via a tightly fitting face mask.

===Pretreatment===
Pretreatment consists of the medications given to specific groups of high-risk patients 3 minutes before the paralysis stage with the aim of protecting the patient from the adverse effects of introducing the laryngoscope and endotracheal tube. Intubation causes increased [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activity, an increase in [[intracranial pressure]] and bronchospasm. Patients with [[reactive airway disease]], increased intracranial pressure, or cardiovascular disease may benefit from pretreatment.

===Paralysis with induction===
With standard intravenous induction of general anesthesia, the patient typically receives an [[opioid]], and then a hypnotic medication. Generally the patient will be manually ventilated for a short period of time before a [[neuromuscular block]]ing agent is administered and the patient is intubated. During rapid sequence induction, the person still receives an IV opioid. However, the difference lies in the fact that the induction drug and neuromuscular blocking agent are administered in rapid succession with no time allowed for manual ventilation. 

Commonly used hypnotics include [[Sodium thiopental|thiopental]], [[propofol]] and [[etomidate]]. Commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents used include [[Suxamethonium chloride|succinylcholine]] and [[Rocuronium bromide|rocuronium]].<ref name=Pousman2000>{{cite journal|last=Pousman|first=RM|title=Rapid Sequence Induction for Prehospital Providers|journal=The Internet Journal of Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|year=2000|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijeicm/vol4n1/rapid.xml#documentHeading-VI.Pharmacology}}</ref> The [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blocking agents]] paralyze all of the [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscles]], most notably and importantly in the [[oropharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. [[Opioid]]s such as [[fentanyl]] may be given to attenuate the responses to the intubation process ([[tachycardia|accelerated heart rate]] and increased [[intracranial pressure]]). This is supposed to have advantages in patients with [[Ischaemic heart disease|ischemic heart disease]] and those with [[brain injury]] (e.g. after [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]]). [[Lidocaine]] is also theorized to blunt a rise in intracranial pressure during laryngoscopy, although this remains controversial and its use varies greatly. Atropine may be used to prevent a reflex bradycardia from vagal stimulation during laryngoscopy, especially in young children and infants. Despite their common use, such adjunctive medications have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes.<ref name=Neilipovitz2007>{{cite journal|last=Neilipovitz|first=DT|last2=Crosby|first2=ET|title=No evidence for decreased incidence of aspiration after rapid sequence intubation|journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia|volume=54|issue=9|pages=748–64|year=2007|pmid=17766743|pmc=|doi=10.1007/BF03026872|url=http://www.cja-jca.org/cgi/content/full/54/9/748}}</ref>

===Positioning===
This phase consists of appropriately positioning the patient to facilitate intubation. The optimal position to open up the airway is usually described as a "sniffing" position, with head extension and flexion of the neck on the body. This is usually done by placing a pillow under the head of the patient and extending the head. However, some evidence exists that head extension alone results in similar ease of intubation.<ref>{{cite pmid|11605921}}</ref>

Sellick's maneuver, or cricothyroid pressure, may also be used in this phase.

===Placement of tube===
During this stage, [[laryngoscopy]] is performed to visualize the [[glottis]]. The endotracheal tube is then passed in between the [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]], and a cuff is inflated around the tube to hold it in place and prevent aspiration of stomach contents.

The position of the tube in the trachea can be confirmed in a number of ways, including observing increasing end tidal carbon dioxide, aspiration, chest movement and misting of the tube.

===Postintubation management===
Malpositioning of the endotracheal tube (in a bronchus, above the glottis, or in the oesophagus) should be excluded by performing a chest [[X-ray]].

One important difference between RSI and routine tracheal intubation is that the [[respiratory therapist|practitioner]] does not typically manually assist the ventilation of the lungs after the onset of general anesthesia and [[apnea|cessation of breathing]], until the trachea has been intubated and the cuff has been inflated.<ref name=Stone2000>{{cite book|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=RD|title=Anesthesia, Volume 1|author=Stone DJ and Gal TJ|chapter=Airway management|pages=1414–51|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia|edition=5th|year=2000|isbn=978-0-443-07995-5|url=http://www.amazon.com/Anesthesia-Fifth-5th-Volumes-Included/dp/B003K8IDK8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1283816205&sr=8-4}}</ref>

==Additional considerations==
Age can play a role in whether or not the procedure is warranted, and is commonly needed in younger persons.<ref name="pmid18439793">{{cite journal |author=Warner KJ, Sharar SR, Copass MK, Bulger EM |title=Prehospital management of the difficult airway: a prospective cohort study |journal=[[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=257–65 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=18439793 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2007.10.058 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0736-4679(08)00011-5 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref> The clinician that performs RSI must be skilled in tracheal intubation and also in [[bag valve mask]] ventilation. Alternative airway management devices must be immediately available, in the event the trachea cannot be intubated using conventional techniques. Such devices include the [[combitube]] and the [[laryngeal mask airway]]. Invasive techniques such as [[cricothyrotomy]] must also be available in the event of inability to intubate the trachea by more conventional techniques.

==Controversy==
Since the introduction of RSI, there has been controversy regarding virtually every aspect of this technique, including:<ref name=Elorbany2010>{{cite journal|first=MI|last=El-Orbany|first2=LA|last2=Connolly|title=Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation: Current Controversy|journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1318–25|year=2010|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181d5ae47|url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/110/5/1318.full.pdf}}</ref>
