The '''[[brachial plexus]]''' is a network of [[nerve]]s that conducts signals from the [[spinal cord]], which is housed in the [[spinal canal]] of the [[vertebral column]] (or spine), to the [[shoulder]], [[arm]] and [[hand]]. These nerves originate in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth cervical (C5-C8), and first thoracic (T1) spinal nerves, and innervate the muscles and skin of the chest, shoulder, arm and hand. Brachial plexus injuries, or lesions, are caused by damage to those nerves.<ref name="ninds">{{cite web | url= http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brachial_plexus/brachial_plexus.htm  | title=NINDS Brachial Plexus Injuries: Information Page | publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke | date=Last updated September 29, 2008 - see bottom of webpage) |accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref><ref name="Cincinnati">{{cite web | url= http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/info/neurology/diagnose/brachial-plexus.htm  | title=Brachial Plexus Injury: Description & illustrations | publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital, health information website | year=(revision 9/09 - see bottom of webpage) |accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded">{{cite book| title=Mosby's Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary | editors=Glanze, W.D., Anderson, K.N., & Anderson, L.E | edition=3rd | publisher= The C.V.

=== Children ===
	
As for the epidemiology of brachial plexus injury in children OBPP also known, as obstetrical brachial plexus palsy occurred the most for young children ranging from 0.38 to 1.56 per 1000 live births due to the type of care and the average birth weight of infants in different regions of the world.<ref name="Smania 2012"/> For example a study was done for the incidence of OBPP where [[USA]] is about 1.51 cases per 1000 live births, a [[Canadian]] study, where the incidence was between 0.5 and 3 injuries per 1000 live Birth, and [[European countries]], such as a Dutch study reported an incidence of 4.6 per 1000 births.<ref name="Smania 2012"/> Newborns with brachial plexus injury was most commonly found in [http://diabetes.webmd.com/ Diabetic] women whose babies weighed more than 4.5 kg at birth along with different types of deliveries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=William M.|last2=Nesbitt|first2=Thomas S.|last3=Danielsen|first3=Beate|year=1999|title=Associated Factors in 1611 Cases of Brachial Plexus Injury. |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology|volume=93|issue=4|pages=536-540|url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/1999/04000/Associated_Factors_in_1611_Cases_of_Brachial.13.aspx}}</ref> Brachial plexus injury risks for newborns are increased with gained birth weight, birth delivery where a vacuum is assisted, and not being able to handle [[glucose]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ecker|first=J.|year=1997|title=Birth Weight as a Predictor of Brachial Plexus Injury|journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology|volume=89|issue=5|pages=643-697}}</ref> Brachial plexus injury is a traumatic event and that has been shown to increase over the years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dubuisson|first=Annie S.|year=2002|title=Clinical Studies: Brachial Plexus Injury: A Survey of 100 Consecutive Cases from a Single Service|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=51|issue=3|pages=673-683|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/2002/09000/Brachial_Plexus_Injury__A_Survey_of_100.11.aspx}}</ref>

[[File:Figure 4. Motorcycles and BPI.jpg|thumb|Figure 4. Motorcycles and BPI]]

==Causes==
In most cases the nerve roots are stretched or torn from their origin, since the meningeal covering of a nerve root is thinner than the sheath enclosing the nerve.  The [[epineurium]] of the nerve is contiguous with the [[dura mater]], providing extra support to the nerve.

Brachial plexus lesions typically result from excessive stretching; from rupture injury where the nerve is torn but not at the spinal cord; or from [[avulsion injury|avulsion injuries]], where the nerve is torn from its attachment at the spinal cord. A build-up of scar tissue around a brachial plexus injury site can also put pressure on the injured nerve, disrupting innervation of the muscles. Although injuries can occur at any time, many brachial plexus injuries happen during birth: the baby's shoulders may become impacted during the birth process causing the brachial plexus nerves to stretch or tear. Obstetric injuries may occur from mechanical injury involving [[shoulder dystocia]] during difficult [[Childbirth#Mechanical fetal injury|childbirth]], the most common of which result from injurious stretching of the child's brachial plexus during birth, mostly vaginal, but occasionally [[Caesarean section]]. The excessive stretch results in incomplete sensory and/or motor function of the injured nerve.<ref name="Cincinnati" /><ref name="adam" />

Injuries to the brachial plexus result from excessive stretching or tearing of the C5-T1 [[nerve fibers]]. These injuries can be located in front of or behind the [[clavicle]], nerve disruptions, or root avulsions from the [[spinal cord]]. These injuries are diagnosed based on clinical exams, [[axon reflex]] testing, and [http://www.medicalhealthtests.com/medical-tests/electrophysiology-test.html electrophysiological testing].<ref name="Davis-1978">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Davis | first1 = DH. | last2 = Onofrio | first2 = BM. | last3 = MacCarty | first3 = CS. | title = Brachial plexus injuries. | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 53 | issue = 12 | pages = 799-807 | month = Dec | year = 1978 | doi =  | PMID = 732356 }}</ref> Brachial plexus injuries require quick treatment in order for the patient to make a full functional recovery (Tung, 2003).

[[Physical trauma|Trauma]]tic brachial plexus injuries may arise from several causes, including sports, high-velocity [[motor vehicle accidents]], especially in [[motorcycle|motorcyclists]], but also all-terrain-vehicle (ATV) accidents. Injury from a direct blow to the lateral side of the [[scapula]] is also possible. The severity of nerve injuries may vary from a mild stretch to the nerve root tearing away from the spinal cord (avulsion). "The brachial plexus may be injured by falls from a height on to the side of the head and shoulder, whereby the nerves of the plexus are violently stretched...The brachial plexus may also be injured by direct violence or gunshot wounds, by violent traction on the arm, or by efforts at reducing a dislocation of the shoulder joint".<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046"/>

Brachial plexus lesions can be divided into three types:
# An '''upper brachial plexus lesion''', which occurs from excessive lateral neck flexion away from the shoulder.  Most commonly, [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps delivery]] or falling on the neck at an angle causes upper plexus lesions leading to [[Erb's palsy]].<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" /> This type of injury produces a very characteristic sign called ''Waiter's tip deformity'' due to loss of the lateral rotators of the shoulder, arm flexors, and hand extensor muscles.<ref name="Cincinnati" /><ref name="neurologynotes">{{cite web | url= http://www.mrcpass.com/Notes/Neurology%20Notes.pdf  | title=Neurology notes | publisher=MrCPass.com | year=(modified 3-10-2009 - see bottom of webpage) |accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref>
# Less frequently, the '''whole brachial plexus lesion''' occurs;<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=DlF3yl2HJFIC&lpg=PA366&ots=6upxnXa8pe&dq=%22entire%20brachial%20plexus%20lesion%22&hl=sl&pg=PA366#v=onepage&q=%22entire%20brachial%20plexus%20lesion%22&f=false</ref>
# most infrequently, sudden upward pulling on an abducted arm (as when someone breaks a fall by grasping a tree branch) produces a '''lower brachial plexus lesion''', in which the eighth cervical ([[Cervical spinal nerve 8|C8]]) and first thoracic [[thoracic nerves|(T1)]] nerves are injured "either before or after they have joined to form the lower trunk. The subsequent paralysis affects, principally, the intrinsic muscles of the hand and the flexors of the wrist and fingers".<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" /> This results in a form of paralysis known as [[Klumpke's paralysis]].<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" /><ref name="Bienstock&Kim">{{cite web|author=Bienstock, A., & Kim, J.Y.S. |title=Brachial Plexus Surgery article, with overview of brachial plexus injury | url= http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic450.htm | publisher=Emedicine |year=2009 |month=Updated July 13|accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref>
==Injury Mechanism of Brachial Plexus==
Injury to the brachial plexus can happen in numerous environments. These may include contact sports, motor vehicle accidents and birth.<ref name="Midha">Midha, Rajiv, MD. "Neurosurgery." Epidemiology of Brachial Plexus Injuries in a Multitrauma Po... :. Congress of Neurological Surgeons, June 1997. Web. 29 Jan. 2013.</ref> Although these are but a common few events, there is one of two mechanisms of injury that remain constant during the point of injury. The two mechanisms that can occur are [[Traction_(orthopedics)|traction]] and heavy [[Impact_(mechanics)|impact]].<ref>Narakas, A.O. "The Treatment of Brachial Plexus Injuries." Link.springer.com.

[[File:Brachial plexus 1323.png|thumb|Traction, also known as stretch injury, is one of the mechanisms that cause brachial plexus injury. The nerves of the brachial plexus are damaged due to the forced pull by the widening of the shoulder and neck. This is a closer look at the traction mechanism at the cervical spine. The arrowed red line represents the stretch of the nerves. Depending on the force, lesions may occur.]]
===Traction===
Traction occurs from severe movement and causes a pull or [[Tension (physics)|tension]] among the nerves. There are two types of traction: downward traction and upward traction. In downward traction there is tension of the arm which forces the angle of the [[neck]] and [[shoulder]] to become broader. This tension is forced and can cause [[lesions]] of the upper roots and trunk of the nerves of the brachial plexus. Upward traction also results in the broadening of the neck and shoulder angle but this time the nerves of T1 and C8 are torn away.<ref>Coene, L.N.J.E.M. "Mechanisms of Brachial Plexus Lesions." ScienceDirect.com. Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, 25 Mar. 2003. Web. 29 Jan. 2013.</ref>

===Impact===
Heavy impact to the shoulder is the second common mechanism to causing injury to the brachial plexus. Depending on the severity of the impact, [[lesions]] can occur at all nerves in the brachial plexus. The location of impact also affects the severity of the injury and depending on the location the nerves of the brachial plexus may be ruptured or [[Avulsion_fracture|avulsed]]. Some forms of impact that affect the injury to the brachial plexus are [[shoulder dislocation]], clavicle fractures, [[hyperextension]] of the arm and sometimes delivery at birth.<ref name="Jeyaseelan-2013">{{Cite journal

==Injury Classification==
The severity of brachial plexus injury is determined by the type of nerve damage.<ref name="ninds" /> There are several different '''classification systems''' for grading the severity of [[nerve]] and brachial plexus injuries. Most systems attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, pathology and prognosis. [[Seddon's classification]], devised in 1943, continues to be used, and is based on three main types of nerve fiber injury, and whether there is continuity of the nerve.<ref name="Tavaris">{{cite web | url=http://www.medstudents.com.br/neuroc/neuroc4.htm| title=Classification of nerve injuries | last= Tavaris| first= Marcio Pessanha| publisher=MEDSTUDENTS - Neurosurgery | year=Publication date unclear | accessdate= 2009-10-08}}</ref>

# [[Neurapraxia]]: The mildest form of nerve injury. It involves an interruption of the nerve conduction without loss of continuity of the [[axon]]. Recovery takes place without [[wallerian degeneration]].<ref name="Tavaris" /><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded805">Glanze, W.D., Anderson, K.N., & Anderson, L.E (1990), p.805</ref>
# [[Axonotmesis]]: Involves axonal degeneration, with loss of the relative continuity of the axon and its covering of myelin, but preservation of the connective tissue framework of the nerve (the encapsulating tissue, the [[epineurium]] and [[perineurium]], are preserved).<ref name="Tavaris" /><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded117">Glanze, W.D., Anderson, K.N., & Anderson, L.E (1990), p.117</ref>
#[[Neurotmesis]]: The most severe form of nerve injury, in which the nerve is completely disrupted by contusion, traction or laceration. Not only the axon, but the encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The most extreme degree of neurotmesis is transsection, although most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather, internal disruption of the nerve architecture sufficient to involve perineurium and [[endoneurium]] as well as axons and their covering. It requires surgery, with unpredictable recovery.<ref name="Tavaris" /><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded810">Glanze, W.D., Anderson, K.N., & Anderson, L.E (1990), p.810</ref>

A more recent and commonly used system described by the late Sir Sydney Sunderland,<ref name="Sunderlandsobituary1">{{cite journal |author=Ryan, G.B. |title=Obituary: Professor Emeritus Sir Sydney Sunderland (1910-1993) |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=187(Pt1) |pages=249–251 |year=1995 |month=August|pmid=7591982 |doi=|accessdate=2009-10-08 |pmc=1167365}}</ref> divides nerve injuries into five degrees: '''first degree''' or neurapraxia, following on from Seddon, in which the insulation around the nerve called myelin is damaged but the nerve itself is spared, and '''second through fifth''' degree, which denotes increasing severity of injury. With '''fifth degree''' injuries, the nerve is completely divided.<ref name="Tavaris" />

==Presentation (Signs and Symptoms)==
'''Signs''' and '''Symptoms''' may include a limp or paralyzed arm, lack of muscle control in the arm, hand, or wrist, and lack of feeling or sensation in the arm or hand. Although several mechanisms account for brachial plexus injuries, the most common is nerve compression or stretch. Infants, in particular, may suffer brachial plexus injuries during delivery and these present with typical patterns of weakness, depending on which portion of the brachial plexus is involved. The most severe form of injury is nerve root avulsion, which results in complete weakness in corresponding muscles. This usually accompanies high-velocity impacts that occurs during motor vehicle or bicycle accidents.<ref name="Cincinnati" />

=== Disabilities ===
Based on the location of the nerve damage, brachial plexus injuries can affect part of or the entire [[arm]]. For example, musculocutaneous nerve damage weakens [[elbow]] [[flexors]], median nerve damage causes proximal [[forearm]] pain, and paralysis of the ulnar nerve causes weak grip and [[finger]] numbness.<ref name="Lorei-1993">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lorei | first1 = MP. | last2 = Hershman | first2 = EB. | title = Peripheral nerve injuries in athletes. Treatment and prevention. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 130-47 | month = Aug | year = 1993 | doi =  | PMID = 8378668 }}</ref> In some cases, these injuries can cause total and irreversible [[paralysis]]. In less severe cases, these injuries limit use of these limbs and cause pain.<ref>Wynn Parry CB (1984). Brachial plexus injuries. British Journal of Hospital Medicine 32(3): 130-132, 134-139. </ref>
[[File:Anterior and posterior upper limb view.jpg|thumb|This image shows the anterior and posterior views of the torso and upper limb of the human body.]]

The cardinal signs of brachial plexus injury then, are [[weakness]] in the arm,  diminished [[reflexes]], and  corresponding sensory deficits.

# '''Erb's palsy'''.  "The position of the limb, under such conditions, is characteristic: the arm hangs by the side and is rotated medially; the forearm is extended and pronated. The arm cannot be raised from the side; all power of flexion of the elbow is lost, as is also supination of the forearm".<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" />
# In '''Klumpke's paralysis''', a form of paralysis involving the muscles of the forearm and hand,<ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded667">Glanze et al. (1990) p.667</ref> a characteristic sign is the ''clawed hand'', due to loss of function of the [[ulnar nerve]] and the intrinsic muscles of the hand it supplies.<ref name="neurologynotes" />
==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis may be confirmed by an [[Electromyography|EMG]] examination in 5 to 7 days. The evidence of denervation will be evident. If there is no nerve conduction 72 hours after the injury, then avulsion is most likely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.
The most advanced diagnostic  method is MR imaging of the brachial plexus using a high Tesla MRI scanner like 1.5 T or more. MR help us in the assessment of the injuries in specific context of site, extent and the  nerve roots involved. in addition, assessment of the cervical cord, post traumatic changes in soft tissues may also be visualised.

==Treatment==
Treatment for brachial plexus injuries includes orthosis/splinting,occupational or physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery. Some brachial plexus injuries may heal without treatment. Many infants improve or recover within 6 months, but those that do not have a very poor outlook and will need further surgery to try to compensate for the nerve deficits.<ref name="ninds" /><ref name="adam" /> The ability to bend the elbow (biceps function) by the third month of life is considered an indicator of probable recovery, with additional upward movement of the wrist, as well as straightening of  thumb and fingers an even stronger indicator of excellent spontaneous improvement.  Gentle range of motion exercises performed by parents, accompanied by repeated examinations by a physician, may be all that is necessary for patients with strong indicators of recovery.<ref name="Cincinnati"/>

== Brachial Plexus Injury Rehabilitation==

There are many treatments to facilitate the process of recovery in people who have brachial plexus injuries. Improvements occur slowly and the [[Rehabilitation]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}} process can take up to many years. Many factors should be considered when estimating a time of recovery. Factors such as initial diagnosis of the injury, severity of the injury, and type of treatments used.<ref name="Rirch663">Rirch R. Greenwood R, Barnes M, McMillan T, Ward C: Management of brachial plexus injuries. Handbook of neurological rehabilitation. Second ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press; 2003. p663-94 </ref> Some forms of treatment include [[nerve]] grafts, medication, surgical decompression, nerve transfer, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.<ref name="Rirch663"/>

==Physical Therapy==
Having an effective occupational and [[physical therapy]] program is important when dealing with the unfortunate circumstances of brachial plexus injuries. One of the main goals of rehabilitation is to prevent muscle atrophy until the nerves regain function. [[Electrical stimulation]] is an effective treatment to help patients reach this fundamental goal. Exercises that involve shoulder extension, flexion, elevation, depression, abduction and adduction facilitate healing by engaging the nerves in the damaged sites as well as improve muscle function. [[Stretching]] is done on a daily basis to improve or maintain range of motion. Stretching is important in order to rehabilitate since it increases the blood flow to the injury as well as facilitate nerves to function properly.<ref>Nath RK, Karicherla P, Mahmooduddin F.: Shoulder function and anatomy in complete obstetric brachial plexus palsy: long-term improvement after triangle tilt surgery. Childs Nervsysts 2010: 26:10009-19.</ref>

==Treatment==

The exercises mentioned above can be done to help rehabilitate from mild cases of the injury. However, in more serious brachial plexus injuries surgical interventions can be used. Function can be restored by nerve repairs, nerve replacements, and surgery to remove [[tumors]] causing the injury.<ref>Bertelli, J. A., & Ghizoni, M. F. (2011). Results and current approach for Brachial Plexus reconstruction. Journal Of Brachial Plexus & Peripheral Nerve Injury, 6(1), 1-8. </ref> Another crucial factor to note is that psychological problems can hinder the rehabilitation process due to a lack of motivation from the patient. On top of promoting a lifetime process of physical healing, it is important to not overlook the psychological well being of a patient. This is due to the possibility of depression or complications with head injuries.<ref> Novak, C. B., Anastakis, K. J., Beaton, D. E., Mackinnon, S.E., & Katz, J. (2011). Biomedical and Psychosocial Factors Associated with Disability After Peripheral Nerve Injury.  Journal Of Bone & Joint Surgery, American Volume, 93-A(10). </ref>
 
==Prognosis==
The site and type of brachial plexus injury determine the prognosis. Avulsion and rupture injuries require timely surgical intervention for any chance of recovery. For milder injuries involving build-up of scar tissue and for neurapraxia, the potential for improvement varies, but there is a fair prognosis for spontaneous recovery, with a 90 - 100% return of function.<ref name="ninds" /><ref name="Cincinnati" />
