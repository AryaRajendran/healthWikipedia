The '''biopsychiatry controversy''' is a dispute over which viewpoint should predominate and form the scientific basis of [[psychiatric]] theory and practice. The debate is a criticism of a claimed strict [[biological psychiatry|biological view]] of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric thinking]]. Its critics include disparate groups such as the [[antipsychiatry]] movement and some academics. 

==Overview of opposition to biopsychiatry==
Over centuries of progress medical science has developed a variety of therapeutic practices that have made many illnesses more treatable or even fully eradicable.  Biological psychiatry or biopsychiatry aims to investigate determinants of mental disorders devising remedial measures of a primarily somatic nature.

This has been criticized by Alvin Pam for being a "stilted, unidimensional, and mechanistic world-view", so that subsequent "research in psychiatry has been geared toward discovering which aberrant genetic or neurophysiological factors underlie and cause social deviance".<ref>{{Cite book

==Research issues==
=== Current status in biopsychiatric research ===
Biopsychiatric research has produced reproducible abnormalities of brain structure and function, and a strong genetic component for a number of psychiatric disorders (although the latter has never been shown to be causative, merely correlative). It has also elucidated some of the mechanisms of action of medications that are effective in treating some of these disorders. Still, by their own admission, this research has not progressed to the stage that they can identify clear [[biomarker]]s of these disorders.
{{quotation|Research has shown that serious neurobiological disorders such as schizophrenia reveal reproducible abnormalities of brain structure (such as ventricular enlargement) and function. Compelling evidence exists that disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism to name a few have a strong genetic component. Still, brain science has not advanced to the point where scientists or clinicians can point to readily discernible pathologic lesions or genetic abnormalities that in and of themselves serve as reliable or predictive biomarkers of a given mental disorder or mental disorders as a group. Ultimately, no gross anatomical lesion such as a tumor may ever be found; rather, mental disorders will likely be proven to represent disorders of intercellular communication; or of disrupted neural circuitry. Research already has elucidated some of the mechanisms of action of medications that are effective for depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, attention deficit, and cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These medications clearly exert influence on specific neurotransmitters, naturally occurring brain chemicals that effect, or regulate, communication between neurons in regions of the brain that control mood, complex reasoning, anxiety, and cognition. In 1970, The Nobel Prize was awarded to Julius Axelrod, Ph.D., of the National Institute of Mental Health, for his discovery of how anti-depressant medications regulate the availability of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in the synapses, or gaps, between nerve cells.|[[American Psychiatric Association]]|Statement on Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Disorders<ref>[http://www.critpsynet.freeuk.com/APA.htm APA statement on Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Disorders], [[American Psychiatric Association]], September 26, 2003</ref>}}

===Focus on genetic factors===
Researchers have proposed that most common psychiatric and drug abuse disorders can be traced to a small number of dimensions of genetic risk<ref>[http://www.news.vcu.edu/news.aspx?v=detail&nid=396 Most psychiatric disorders share a small number of genetic risk factors, VCU study shows], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]</ref> and reports show significant associations between specific [[genomic]] regions and psychiatric disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pickard BS |title=Candidate psychiatric illness genes identified in patients with pericentric inversions of chromosome 18 |journal=Psychiatric Genetics |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15722956 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0955-8829&volume=15&issue=1&spage=37 |doi=10.1097/00041444-200503000-00007|author-separator=,|author2=Malloy MP|author3=Clark L|display-authors=3|last4=Lehellard|first4=St??Phanie|last5=Ewald|first5=Henrik L.|last6=Mors|first6=Ole|last7=Porteous|first7=David J.|last8=Blackwood|first8=Douglas H.

===Focus on biochemical factors===
{{See also|Chemical imbalance|Monoamine Hypothesis}}
The [[chemical imbalance]] hypothesis states that a chemical imbalance within the brain is the main cause of psychiatric conditions and that these conditions can be improved with medication which corrects this imbalance. In this hypothesis, emotions within a "normal" spectrum reflect a proper balance of neurochemicals, but abnormally extreme emotions, such as [[clinical depression]], reflect an imbalance. This conceptual framework has been challenged within the scientific community, although no other demonstrably superior hypothesis has emerged. While the hypothesis has been shown to be simplistic and lacking (especially regarding psychotropic drugs with novel mechanisms such as [[tianeptine]]),<ref>{{Cite journal|author=McEwen BS |title=The neurobiological properties of tianeptine (Stablon): from monoamine hypothesis to glutamatergic modulation |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume= 15|issue= 3|pages= 237–249|year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19704408 |pmc=2902200 |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.80|author-separator=,|author2=Chattarji S|author3=Diamond DM|display-authors=3|last4=Jay|first4=T M|last5=Reagan|first5=L P|last6=Svenningsson|first6=P|last7=Fuchs|first7=E}}</ref> there is sufficient evidence to consider it as a useful heuristic in the aiding of our understanding of brain chemistry and explaining pharmacotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Schildkraut JJ |title=The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=509–22 |year=1965 |month=November |pmid=5319766 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.122.5.509 |doi_brokendate=2010-01-05 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/5/509}}</ref><ref>[http://www.touchneurology.com/looking-beyond-monoamine-hypothesis-a5616-1.html Looking Beyond the Monoamine Hypothesis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Reductionism===
[[Niall McLaren]] emphasizes in his books ''[[Niall McLaren#Humanizing Madness|Humanizing Madness]]'' and ''[[Niall McLaren#Humanizing Psychiatry|Humanizing Psychiatry]]'' that the major problem with psychiatry is that it lacks a unified model of the mind and has become entrapped in a biological [[reductionism|reductionist]] paradigm. The reasons for this biological shift are intuitive as reductionism has been very effective in other fields of science and medicine. However, despite reductionism's efficacy  in explaining the smallest parts of the brain this does not explain the mind, which is where he contends the majority of psychopathology stems from. An example would be that every aspect of a computer can be understood scientifically down to the very last atom, however this does not reveal the program that drives this hardware. He also argues that the widespread acceptance of the reductionist paradigm leads to a lack of openness to self-criticism and therefore halts the very engine of scientific progress.<ref>{{Cite book

He has proposed his own natural [[dualism|dualist]] model of the mind, the [[biocognitive model]], which is rooted in the theories of [[David Chalmers]] and [[Alan Turing]] and does not fall into the dualist's trap of [[spiritualism]].<ref>{{Cite book

==Economic influences on psychiatric practice==

[[American Psychiatric Association]] president Steven S. Sharfstein has stated that when the [[profit motive]] of pharmaceutical companies and human good are aligned, that the results are mutually beneficial and that "Pharmaceutical companies have developed and brought to market medications that have transformed the lives of millions of psychiatric patients.  The proven effectiveness of antidepressant, mood-stabilizing, and antipsychotic medications has helped sensitize the public to the reality of mental illness and taught them that treatment works. In this way, Big Pharma has helped reduce stigma associated with psychiatric treatment and with psychiatrists." However, too often "[t]he practice of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry have different goals and abide by different ethics." He states a number of concerns exacerbating this situation which he suggests require remedying, including:<ref name=Sharfstein>{{Cite journal

*that the psychiatric profession has allowed the [[biopsychosocial model]] to become entirely dominated by biological factors;
*a "broken health care system" that allows "many patients [to be] prescribed the wrong drugs or drugs they don't need";
*"medical education opportunities sponsored by pharmaceutical companies [that] are often biased toward one product or another";
*"[d]irect marketing to consumers [that] also leads to increased demand for medications and inflates expectations about the benefits of medications";
*drug company gifts to doctors, that have become sufficiently problematical as to warrant legislative constraints; and
*"drug companies [paying] physicians to allow company reps to sit in on patient sessions allegedly to learn more about care for patients and then advise the doctor on appropriate prescribing."

Antidepressants have been shown to have only a minimal effect, over that of a [[placebo]], on patients. In an analysis of the efficacy data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of the six most widely prescribed antidepressants approved between 1987 and 1999, it was found that{{quote|Approximately 80% of the response to medication was duplicated in placebo control groups, and the mean difference between drug and placebo was approximately 2 points on the 17-item (50-point) and 21-item (62-point) Hamilton Depression Scale.

The proportion of the drug response duplicated by placebo was significantly greater with observed cases (OC) data than with last observation carried forward (LOCF) data.
