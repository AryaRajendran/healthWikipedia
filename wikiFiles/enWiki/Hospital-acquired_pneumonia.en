'''Hospital-acquired pneumonia''' (HAP) or '''nosocomial pneumonia''' refers to any [[pneumonia]] contracted by a patient in a hospital at least 48–72 hours after being admitted.  It is usually caused by a [[Bacterial pneumonia|bacterial infection]], rather than a [[viral pneumonia|virus]].<ref name="Mandell">

HAP is the second most common [[nosocomial infection]] ([[urinary tract infection]] is the most common) and accounts for 15–20% of the total.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Oxford"/><ref name="Harrison"> [http://books.mcgraw-hill.com/medical/harrisons/ Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine] 16th Edition, The [[McGraw-Hill]] Companies, ISBN 0-07-140235-7</ref> It is the most common cause of death among nosocomial infections and is the primary cause of death in [[intensive care unit]]s.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/>

HAP typically lengthens a hospital stay by 1–2 weeks.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
New or progressive infiltrate on the chest X-Ray with one of the following:<ref name="Harrison"/>
* [[Fever]] > 37.8 °C (100 °F)
* Purulent sputum
* [[Leucocytosis]] > 10.000 cells/μl

== Types ==
* [[Bacterial pneumonia]]: The majority of cases related to various [[gram-negative]] bacilli (52%) and [[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]] (19%), usually of the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] type.<ref name=Kumar13-7> Table 13-7 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition. </ref> Others are [[Haemophilus]] spp. (5%). In the ICU results were S. aureus(17.4%), [[P. aeruginosa]] (17.4%), [[Klebsiella pneumoniae]] and [[Enterobacter]] spp. (18.1%), and [[Haemophilus influenzae]] (4.9%).<ref name="Mandell"/> 

* [[Viral pneumonia]]: [[influenza]] and [[respiratory syncytial virus]] and, in the immunocompromised host, [[cytomegalovirus]]- cause 10-20% of infections.<ref name="Oxford"/>
===Ventilator-associated pneumonia===
'''Ventilator-associated pneumonia''' (VAP) is a sub-type of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) which occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation. VAP is not characterized by the causative agents; rather, as its name implies, definition of VAP is restricted to patients undergoing mechanical ventilation while in a hospital. A positive culture after intubation is indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia and is diagnosed as such. In order to appropriately categorize the causative agent or mechanism it is usually recommended to obtain a culture prior to initiating mechanical ventilation as a reference.
== Risk factors ==
Among the factors contributing to contracting HAP are [[mechanical ventilation]] ([[ventilator-associated pneumonia]]), old age, decreased filtration of inspired air, intrinsic respiratory, neurologic, or other disease states that result in respiratory tract obstruction, trauma, (abdominal) surgery, medications, diminished [[lung volumes]], or decreased clearance of secretions may diminish the defenses of the lung.  Also, poor hand-washing and inadequate disinfection of respiratory devices cause [[cross-infection]] and are important factors.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/>

== Pathogenesis ==
Most nosocomial respiratory infections are caused by so-called skorvatch microaspiration of upper airway secretions, through inapparent [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], into the lower respiratory tract. Also, "macroaspirations" of esophageal or gastric material is known to result in HAP.  Since it results from aspiration either type is called [[aspiration pneumonia]].<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Oxford"/><ref name="Harrison"/>

Although [[gram-negative bacilli]] are a common cause they are rarely found in the respiratory tract of people without pneumonia, which has led to speculation of the mouth and throat as origin of the infection.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Oxford"/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Pneumonia x-ray.jpg|thumb|'''Pneumonia as seen on chest x-ray.''' 
''A'': Normal chest x-ray. ''B'': Abnormal chest x-ray with shadowing from pneumonia in the right lung (left side of image).]]
In hospitalised patients who develop respiratory symptoms and fever one should consider the diagnosis.  The likelihood increases when upon investigation symptoms are found of [[respiratory insufficiency]], purulent secretions, newly developed infiltrate on the [[chest X-Ray]], and increasing [[leucocytosis|leucocyte count]].  If pneumonia is suspected material from sputum or tracheal aspirates are sent to the microbiology department for cultures.  In case of [[pleural effusion]] [[thoracentesis]] is performed for examination of [[pleural fluid]].  In suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia it has been suggested that [[bronchoscopy]]([[Bronchoalveolar lavage|BAL]]) is necessary because of the known risks surrounding clinical diagnoses.<ref name="Mandell"/><ref name="Harrison"/>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
* [[Atelectasis]]
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* [[Pulmonary embolism]]

== Treatment ==
Usually initial therapy is empirical.<ref name="Harrison"/> If sufficient reason to suspect [[influenza]], one might consider [[oseltamivir]]. In case of [[legionellosis]], [[erythromycin]] or [[fluoroquinolone]].<ref name="Mandell"/>

A third generation [[cephalosporin]] ([[ceftazidime]]) + [[carbapenems]] ([[imipenem]]) + [[beta lactam]] & [[beta lactamase inhibitor]]s ([[piperacillin]]/[[tazobactam]])
