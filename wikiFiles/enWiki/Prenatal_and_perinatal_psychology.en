'''[[Fetus|Prenatal]] and [[Pregnancy|perinatal]] psychology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study<ref>McCarthy WA Nurturing the Possible: Supporting The Integrated Self from the Beginning of Life retrieved from [http://www.sbgi.edu/news/featured3.html] on May 16, 2007. Quote: "Prenatal and perinatal psychology (PPN) has grown into a multidisciplinary field “dedicated to the in-depth exploration of the psychological dimension of human reproduction and pregnancy and the mental and emotional development of the unborn and newborn child. The heart of the field’s unique contribution is the exploration and understanding of prenatal life, birth and bonding, and infancy from the baby’s point of view."</ref><ref>McCarty, W. A. (2002a).

The CALL to reawaken and deepen our communication with babies: what babies are teaching us. International Doula 12(2), Summer 2004</ref> of the foundations of health in body, mind, emotions and in enduring response patterns to life. It explores the [[psychological]] and [[psychophysiological]] effects and implications of the earliest experiences of the individual, before birth ("prenatal"), as well as during and immediately after childbirth ("perinatal") on the health and [[learning]] ability of the individual and on their [[Attachment theory|relationships]]. As a broad field it has developed a variety of curative and [[prophylactic|preventive]] interventions for the [[fetus|unborn]], at [[childbirth]], for the newborn, infants and adults who are adversely affected by early prenatal and perinatal dysfunction and trauma. Some of these methods have not been without significant controversy, for example [[homebirth]] in the West and in earlier days, [[LSD]] psychotherapy for resolving birth trauma.

== Overview ==
Examples of the diversity of interests in the subject are: in [[neurobiology]] where it is understood that "experience can change the mature brain - but experience during the critical periods of early childhood organizes brain systems";<ref>Perry, BD, Pollard, R, Blakely, T, Baker, W, Vigilante, D (1995): Childhood trauma, the neurobiology of Adaptation, and “Use-dependent” Development of the Brain: How “States” become “Traits”, Infant Mental Health Journal, vol 16, no. 4, Winter</ref> in [[psychoneuroendocrinology]] where there is evidence of an "umbilical affect exchange" which influences the immediate and long- term psychology of behavior;<ref>Dorner G (G.

"During the pre and/or early post-natal life. systemic hormones and neurotransmitters are capable of acting as organizers of the brain, which is the controller of the neuro-endocrine-immune system. Thus, the quantity of the systemic hormones and neurotransmitters co-determines during a critical period of brain development, the quality, ie. the responsiveness, of their own central nervous system controllers and hence the functional and tolerance ranges of their own feedback systems throughout life ... Abnormal levels of systemic hormones and neurotransmitters, which can be induced by abnormal conditions in the psychosocial and/or natural envlronment. can act as teratogens and lead to permanent physiological and/or psychological dysfunctions in later life. Thus many malfunctions of reproduction. metabolism, information processing, and immunity called up to now idiopathic, essential, cryptogenic, primary or genuine can be explained by pre and/or early postnatal psycho-and/or physiological processes."</ref><ref>Fedor-Freybergh and Vogel, "Encounter with the Unborn: Philosophical Impetus behind Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology and Medicine," xix-xx. "Psychoneuroendocrinologists have already elicited useful data from the preliminary theoretical research in recording fetal response to and retention of outside environmental stimuli (touch, sound, and light stimuli for the most part). Various highly specific biochemical structures (hormones, neurotransmitters and other polypeptide structures) are needed, in direct connection with input phenomena, for the transformation and storage of both sensorial and sensible types of information. Crucial to the formation of the primary central nervous system on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal level, some of these functions are detectable in the very beginning of development of the human being. Thus the embryo successively develops a high sensibility and competency for the potential ability for perception"</ref> in [[bioengineering]] where the importance to development as well as growth of the fetomaternal system is increasingly understood;<ref>[http://faculty.eng.fiu.edu/~mgoyal/N1%20Maternal_fetal.pdf BIOFLUID DYNAMICS OF THE HUMAN MATERNAL FETAL SYSTEM]</ref> and in clinical [[maternal-fetal medicine]]<ref>Clinical Maternal-Fetal Medicine by Hung N.

One such mechanism, discovered through animal studies, involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Although [[Developmental psychology|theoretical]] and [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approaches vary in their treatment of the topic, a common thread is the fundamental importance of pre- and perinatal experiences in the shaping of the [[personality development|personality]] and in future psychological development.

There are widespread doubts regarding the extent to which newborn infants are capable of forming [[memory|memories]], the effects of any such memories on their personality, and the possibility of recovering them from an [[unconscious mind]], which itself is the subject of argument in the field. Only a minority of psychologists have had direct experience of the therapeutic modalities that explore these [[phenomena]] and many question the validity and even the existence of [[repressed memories]]. However, ''experience'' and ''memory'' are not synonymous, and while a fetal infant may not be able to recall his or her experiences, he or she still lived in those moments and possibly had neurological, psychological or physiological responses to them, which may influence the ongoing development of the mind and/or brain structures.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Historical development==

The relevance of birth experiences has been recognized since the early days of modern psychology. Although [[Sigmund Freud]] touched on the idea briefly before rejecting it in favor of the [[Oedipus complex]], one of his disciples [[Otto Rank]] became convinced of the importance of [[birth trauma]] in causing [[neurosis|anxiety neuroses]]. Rank developed a process of [[psychoanalysis]] based on birth experiences, and authored his seminal work, 'The Trauma of Birth'.<ref>Rank O, The Trauma of Birth. New York: Richard Brunner, 1952; Otto Rank, The Myth of the Birth of the Hero and Other Writings. New York: Random House, 1932</ref> Freud's initial agreement and then later volte-face caused a rift between them, which relegated the study of birth trauma to the fringes of psychology. The subject was taken up again in 1949 by [[Nandor Fodor]]<ref>Nandor Fodor, The Search for the Beloved: A Clinical Investigation of the Trauma of Birth and Prenatal Condition. New Hyde Park, N.Y.: University Books, 1949</ref> (1895-1964), a patient of Rank's and teacher of British psychoanalyst Francis John Mott (1901-1980).<ref>Leonard J 'The roots of panic' retrieved from [http://www.franz-renggli.ch/en/artikel/Tracing_the_Roots_of_Panic_to_Prenatal_Trauma.pdf] May 15, 2007</ref><ref>Francis J. Mott, Mythology of the Prenatal Life. London: Integration Publishing Co., 1960</ref> In addition to birth trauma, Fodor emphasized the significance of prenatal trauma.

Developments in the 1950s included a shift in emphasis towards the non-traumatic by [[Donald Winnicott]] (1896-1971), and to the [[transpersonal]] aspects of pre- and perinatal experience by Maarten Lietaert Peerbolte<ref>Maarten Lietaert Peerbolte, "Some Problems Connected Whh Fodor's Birth-Trauma Therapy" Psychiatric Quarterly 26(1952): 294-306</ref><ref>Lietaert Peerbolte, Maarten (editor) - Hermes Trismegistus. Poimandres. Grieks-hermetisch geschrift in het Nederlands vertaald met een transpersonalistische beschouwing. Deventer 1974 Quote: "Lietaert Peerbolte considers the Poimandres in the light of a transpersonal psychology, based on 'peak experiences', a term used to denote various states of expanded consciousness. The translator points out that in the past, these states of heightened consciousness were linked to religious experience. This is clearly demonstrated in Poimandres. The translator hopes that in the coming era there will be a renaissance of the hermetic view of life, stimulated by a transpersonal psychology and a transpersonalist philosophy" retrieved from JR Ritman Library at [http://www.ritmanlibrary.nl/c/p/pub/on_pub/pat/pat_pri_D.html] on May 15, 2007</ref>(1905-1982), and brought attention to the relevance of very early [[gestation]], and even the event of [[Conception (biology)|conception]] by Lietaert Peerbolte. These topics saw later elaboration by [[Frank Lake]] (1914-1982) as well as Michael C. Irving, [[R D Laing]] (1927-1989), Graham Farrant (1933-1993), [[Stanislav Grof]] (born 1931) and others. The expression at a broad social level of basic perinatal feelings, such as "suffering fetus" or "toxic [[placenta]]," is part of the [[narrative]] in [[psychohistory]], developed by [[Lloyd deMause]] (born 1931). Pre- and perinatal psychology is at the core of [[Primal therapy]] and [[Primal integration]]. Professor Stephen M. Maret (born 1960) has explored these influences in his book, ''The Prenatal Person''.<ref>Maret S The Prenatal Person University Press of America (November 6, 1997) English ISBN 0-7618-0768-3 ISBN 978-0761807681</ref>

Material emerging from sessions of [[psychedelic psychotherapy]] using [[LSD]] and other [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]] was the foundation for research into the enduring effects of pre- and perinatal experiences in adult life conducted by [[Frank Lake]], [[Athanasios Kafkalides]] (1919-1989) and [[Stanislav Grof]]. Grof went on to formulate an extensive theoretical framework for the analysis of pre- and perinatal experiences, based on the four constructs he called [[Perinatal Matrices|Basic Perinatal Matrices]]. Lake and Grof independently developed breathing techniques, following [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897-1957) as an alternative to the use of psychedelic drugs, which was subject to considerable legal difficulty from the mid-1960s onwards. A related technique called [[Rebirthing Breathwork]] was developed by [[Leonard Orr]] (born 1937); and [[Core process psychotherapy]] trainees relive presumed birth trauma as part of their training.

Public attention was drawn to the importance of prenatal experiences by the 1981 book, ''The Secret Life of the Unborn Child'',<ref>T. Verny, ''The Secret Life of the Unborn Child'', 1981; Dell 1982 reprint: ISBN 0-440-50565-8</ref> by Thomas R. Verny (born 1936), who founded the Association for Pre- & Perinatal Psychology and Health (APPPAH). David Barnes Chamberlain (born 1928), who was president of the APPPAH from 1991 to 1999, published a popular book entitled, ''Babies Remember Birth'' (1988), outlining new experimental research that supports the existence of pre-natal memories. Further evidence was presented by Ludwig Janus (born 1939) in ''The Enduring Effects of Prenatal Experience'' (1997). 

Perhaps the first book to effectively convey the importance of trauma-free childbirth to the wider public was ''Birth Without Violence'' (1975), by French [[obstetrician]] [[Frederick Leboyer|Dr. Frederick Leboyer]] (born 1918),<ref>* F. Leboyer, ''Birth Without Violence'', 1975; 2nd revision 2002: ISBN 0-89281-983-9; also online (see external links)</ref> which helped popularize the practice of placing newly-born infants in a tub of warm water, known as a "Leboyer bath" to simulate the familiar pre-natal environment of warm [[amniotic fluid]]. Following on from Leboyer, another French obstetrician, [[Michel Odent]] (born 1930), pioneered the practice of low intervention labour and took the "Leboyer bath" one step further, developing the use of warm-water pools for a [[water birth]].

In 2004, Dr. Wendy Anne McCarty (born 1951),<ref>W. McCarty, "Welcoming Consciousness: Supporting Babies Wholeness from the Beginning of Life–An Integrated Model of Early Development 2004. Santa Barbara, CA:[www.wondrousbeginnings.com]</ref><ref>W. McCarty, Supporting babies’ wholeness in the 21st century: An integrated model of early development. Journal of Prenatal & Perinatal Psychology & Health, 20(3), 187-220, 2006 [www.wondrousbeginnings.com]</ref> co-founder of the Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology MA and PhD Programs at Santa Barbara Graduate Institute, reviewed the 30 years of clinical research in prenatal and perinatal psychology and current mainstream early development models. In her book ''Welcoming Consciousness'', she introduced the Integrated Model of early development that was reflective of the prenatal and perinatal psychology clinical findings. The transcendental and human aspects of awareness documented from the beginning of life became the core thread in this holonomic holographic model.
