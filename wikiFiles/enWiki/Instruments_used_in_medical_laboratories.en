! Instrument !! Uses
|-
| [[Test tube]] || ''vide link''
|-
| [[Blood_sugar#Methodology|Folin-Wu tube]] for blood glucose determination || used in Folin and Wu's method of non-enzymatic estimation of blood glucose.
|-
| [[Glass slide]] and cover slips || in [[microscopy]], [[serology]], etc. as the solid backing on which test samples are taken.
|-
| [[Petri dish]] || used for preparation of [[culture media]], and culture of organisms therein.
|-
| A glass [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]] || reagent storage
|-
| A glass [[Laboratory flask|flask]] || gastric acid, or other fluid [[titration]]
|-
| [[Pasteur pipette]] || for aspiration and addition of reagents
|-
| [[Graduated pipettes]] || for aspiration and addition of reagents, often of minuscule amounts of the material. Used mainly in [[colorimetry]].
|-
| [[Syringes]] and needles || ''vide link''
|-
| [[Rubber gloves|Disposable gloves]] || prevention of transmission of diseases (as long a not cut or perforated) to or from the user.
|-
| [[Tourniquet]] || used to cause an artificial venous stasis by applying pressure through this rubber tube. It leads to engorgement of the veins allowing them to be seen better. Used for intravenous injections and cannulation.
|-
| [[Microscope]] || used for visualising minute structures including [[microbes]].
|-
| [[Bunsen burner]] or spirit lamps or candles || source of fire / heat
|-
| [[Ultracentrifuge]] || used to separate particles dispersed in a liquid according to their [[molecular mass]]
|-
| [[Electrophoresis]] apparatus || used to detect and classify [[serum proteins]] or proteins from any other source. Also used for DNA separation.

|-
| Setup for [[Radioimmunoassay]] or [[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]] || previously it was widely used to detect various things in bold fluids like [[proteins]] (natural, infective,  those produced by the body in reaction to disease, cancer related), [[tumor markers]], [[hormones]], [[virus]]es ([[hepatitis]], [[HIV]], etc.), etc.
|- 
| Setup for [[Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay]] ([[ELISA]]) || presently it is widely used to detect various things in bold fluids like [[proteins]] (natural, infective,  those produced by the body in reaction to disease, cancer related), [[tumor markers]], [[hormones]], [[virus]]es ([[hepatitis]], [[HIV]], etc.), etc. It has replaced RIA
|-
|[[Colorimeter (chemistry)|Colorimeter]] || used in photochemical analysis and quantitative estimation of substances ranging from [[blood sugar]], to [[creatinine]], [[hemoglobin]], etc.
|-
| [[Burette]] || used to measure amount of the [[acid]] / [[alkali]] used in [[titration]]
|-
| General laboratory stands, racks, [[filter paper]], [[reagents]], etc. ||
|-
| [[Induction coils]] || as a source of high voltage electricity
|-
| [[Cathode ray oscilloscope]] || ''vide link''
|-
| [[Recording Kymograph]] || historically, used in or human animal experiments to measure and record data.
|-
| Long extension [[kymograph]] || historically, used in or human animal experiments to measure and record data.
|-
| [[Surface Plasmon Resonance]] || Label free detection of molecule binding.  Used to determine kinetic constants of the interaction(''k''<sub>a</sub>, ''k''<sub>d</sub>, K<sub>D</sub>).  Can also be used for thermodynamic analysis.
