'''Retinoblastoma''' (Rb) is a rapidly developing [[cancer]] that develops in the cells of [[retina]], the light-detecting [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] of the eye.<ref name="CancerMedicine">{{cite book |title=Cancer Medicine |last=American Cancer Society |year=2003 |publisher=BC Decker Inc |location=Hamilton, Ontario |isbn=1-55009-213-8 |chapter=Chapter 85. Neoplasms of the Eye |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Retinoblastoma&rid=cmed6.section.20082#20085}}</ref> In the developed world, Rb has one of the best cure rates of all childhood cancers (95-98%), with more than nine out of every ten sufferers surviving into adulthood.

==Classification==
There are two forms of the disease, a [[heritable]] form and [[Non-heritable variations|non-heritable]] form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, but this does not imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 55% of children with Rb have the non-heritable form. If there is no history of the disease within the family, the disease is labeled "sporadic", but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the non-heritable form.

In about two thirds of cases,<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacCarthy A, Birch JM, Draper GJ, ''et al.'' |title=Retinoblastoma in Great Britain 1963-2002 |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=33–7 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18838413 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2008.139618}}</ref> only one eye is affected (unilateral retinoblastoma); in the other third, tumours develop in both eyes (bilateral retinoblastoma). The number and size of tumours on each eye may vary. In certain cases, the [[pineal gland]] is also affected (trilateral retinoblastoma). The position, size and quantity of tumours are considered when choosing the type of treatment for the disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Rb whiteeye.PNG|thumb|Leukocoria in a child with retinoblastoma]]
[[File:squint.jpg|thumb|Crossed eyes in a child with retinoblastoma]]
The most common and obvious [[medical sign|sign]] of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the pupil, [[leukocoria]], also known as amaurotic cat's eye reflex.<ref name="CancerMedicine" /> Other signs and symptoms include deterioration of vision, a red and irritated eye with [[glaucoma]], and faltering growth or delayed development. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint,<ref name="pmid3139234">{{cite journal | author = A. R. Elkington and P. T. Khaw | title = ABC of eyes. Squint | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 297 | issue = 6648 | pages = 608–611 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3139234 | pmc = 1834556 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.297.6648.608 }}</ref> commonly referred to as "cross-eyed" or "wall-eyed" ([[strabismus]]). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding.

Depending on the position of the tumors, they may be visible during a simple eye exam using an [[ophthalmoscope]] to look through the [[pupil]]. A positive diagnosis is usually made only with an examination under anesthetic (EUA). A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly or by other conditions such as [[Coats' disease]].

The presence of the photographic fault [[red eye]] in only one eye and not in the other may be a sign of retinoblastoma. A more clear sign is "white eye" or "cat's eye" ([[leukocoria]]).<ref name="white eye">[http://www.daisyfund.org/rb/leuko/index.html Introduction to White Eye], Daisy's Eye Cancer Fund.</ref>

==Frequency of retinoblastoma==
Retinoblastoma is rare and affects approximately 1 in 15,000 live births, but it is the most common inherited childhood malignancy. In the UK, around 40 to 50 new cases are diagnosed each year. 

Most children are diagnosed before the age of five years old. In the UK, bilateral cases usually present within the first year with the average age at diagnosis being 9 months. Diagnosis of unilateral cases peaks between 24 and 30 months.

==Cause of retinoblastoma==
In children with the heritable genetic form of retinoblastoma there is a mutation on [[Chromosome 13 (human)|chromosome 13]], called the [[RB1]] gene. The genetic codes found in chromosomes control the way in which cells grow and develop within the body.<ref name="pmid16936737">{{cite journal |author=Du W, Pogoriler J |title=Retinoblastoma family genes |journal=Oncogene |volume=25 |issue=38 |pages=5190–200 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16936737 |pmc=1899835 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1209651}}</ref> If a portion of the code is missing or altered (mutation) a cancer may develop.

The defective RB1 gene can be inherited from either parent; in some children, however, the mutation occurs in the early stages of fetal development. 

Inherited forms of retinoblastomas are more likely to be bilateral; in addition, they may be associated with [[pinealoblastoma]] (also known as trilateral retinoblastoma) with a dismal outcome. The genetic codes found in chromosomes control the way in which cells grow and develop within the body.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Marcus DM, Brooks SE, Leff G ''et al.'' | year = 1998 | title = Trilateral retinoblastoma: insights into histogenesis and management | url = | journal = Surv Ophthalmol | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 59–70 | doi = 10.1016/S0039-6257(98)00019-8 | pmid = 9716194 }}</ref>

Several methods have been developed to detect the RB1 gene mutations.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Parsam VL, Kannabiran C, Honavar S, ''et al.'' |title=A comprehensive, sensitive and economical approach for the detection of mutations in the RB1 gene in retinoblastoma |journal= J.

Current research being joint funded by The [http://www.chect.org.uk Childhood Eye Cancer Trust] in Birmingham, UK, is attempting to establish the different types of retinoblastoma children may have and subsequently determine a more successful treatment pathway.

Somatic amplification of the [[MYCN]] [[oncogene]] is responsible for some cases of non-hereditary, early-onset, aggressive, unilateral Rb. Although MYCN amplification accounted for only 1.4% of Rb cases, researchers identified it in 18% of infants diagnosed at less than 6 months of age. Median age at diagnosis for MYCN Rb was 4.5 months, compared with 24 months for those who had non-familial unilateral disease with two RB1 gene mutations.<ref>{{author=Lewis R | title=Some Aggressive Retinoblastomas Lack RB1 Mutations | journal=Medscape online | year=2013| date=March 19 | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781040}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Screening for retinoblastoma should be part of a "well baby" screening for newborns during the first three months of life, to include:
:The [[red reflex]]: checking for a normal reddish-orange reflection from the eye's retina with an ophthalmoscope or retinoscope from approximately 30 cm / 1 foot, usually done in a dimly lit or dark room.
:The [[corneal light reflex]]/Hirchberg test: checking for symmetrical reflection of beam of light in the same spot on each eye when a light is shined into each cornea, to help determine whether the eyes are crossed.
:[[Eye examination]]: checking for any structural abnormalities.

===Differential diagnosis===
:1. [[Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous]] (PHPV): congenital developmental anomaly of the eye resulting from failure of the embryological, primary vitreous and hyaloid vasculature to regress, whereby the eye is shorter, develops a cataract, and may present with whitening of the pupil.
:2. [[Coats disease]]: a typically unilateral disease characterised by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina, leading to blood vessel abnormalities in the retina and retinal detachment to mimic retinoblastoma.
:3. [[Toxocara canis]]: an infectious disease of the eye associated with exposure to infected puppies, which causes a retinal lesion leading to retinal detachment.
:4. [[Retinopathy of prematurity]] (ROP): associated with low birth weight infants who receive supplemental oxygen in the period immediately after birth, it involves damage to the retinal tissue and may lead to retinal detachment.

[[File:MRI retinoblastoma.jpg|thumb|MRI pattern of retinoblastoma with optic nerve involvement (sagittal enhanced T1-weighted sequence)]]If the eye examination is abnormal, further testing may include imaging studies, such as [[computerized tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[ultrasound]]. CT and MRI can help define the structure abnormalities and reveal any calcium depositions. Ultrasound can help define the height and thickness of the tumor. [[Bone marrow]] examination or [[lumbar puncture]] may also be done to determine any [[Metastasis|metastases]] to bones or the brain.

===Morphology===
Gross and microscopic appearances of retinoblastoma are identical in both hereditary and sporadic types. Macroscopically, viable tumor cells are found near blood vessels, while zones of necrosis are found in relatively avascular areas. Microscopically, both undifferentiated and differentiated elements may be present. Undifferentiated elements appear as collections of small, round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei; differentiated elements include [[Flexner-Wintersteiner rosette]]s, [[Homer-Wright rosette]]s,<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee,|first=K.

== Genetic testing ==
Identifying the ''RB1'' gene mutation that led to a child's retinoblastoma can be important in the clinical care of  the affected individual and in the care of (future) siblings and offspring.It may run in the family.
# Bilaterally affected individuals  and 13-15% of unilaterally affected individuals,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schüler A, Weber S, Neuhäuser M,, ''et al.'' |title=Age at diagnosis of isolated unilateral retinoblastoma does not distinguish patients with and without a constitutional RB1 gene mutation but is influenced by a parent-of-origin effect |journal=Eur J Cancer |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=735–40 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15763650 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2004.12.022}}</ref><ref name=pmid19280657>{{cite journal |author=Rushlow D, Piovesan B, Zhang K, ''et al.'' |title=Detection of mosaic RB1 mutations in families with retinoblastoma |journal=Hum Mutat |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=842–51 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19280657 |doi=10.1002/humu.20940}}</ref> are expected to show an RB1 mutation in blood.  By identifying the ''RB1'' mutation in the affected individual, (future) siblings, children, and other relatives can be tested for the mutation; if they do not carry the mutation, child relatives are not at risk of retinoblastoma so need not undergo the trauma and expense of examinations under anaesthetic.<ref name=pmid12541220>{{cite journal |author=Richter S, Vandezande K, Chen N, ''et al.'' |title=Sensitive and efficient detection of RB1 gene mutations enhances care for families with retinoblastoma |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=253–69 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12541220 |doi=10.1086/345651 |pmc=379221}}</ref>  For the 85% of unilaterally affected  patients found not to carry either of their eye tumor RB1 mutations  in blood, neither molecular  testing nor clinical surveillance of siblings is required.
# If  the  ''RB1'' mutation of an affected individual is identified, amniotic cells in an at-risk pregnancy can be tested for the family  mutation;  any fetus that carries the mutation can be delivered early, allowing early treatment of any eye tumors, leading to better visual outcomes.<ref name=pmid12541220 />
#  For cases of unilateral retinoblastoma where no eye tumor  is available for testing, if no ''RB1'' mutation is detected in blood after high sensitivity molecular testing (i.e. >93% RB1 mutation detection sensitivity),  the risk of a germline ''RB1'' mutation is reduced to less than 1%,<ref name=pmid19280657 /> a level at which only clinic examination (and not examinations under anaesthetic) is recommended for the affected individual and their future offspring (National Retinoblastoma Strategy, Canadian Guidelines for Care).<ref name="guidelines">{{cite journal |author=Canadian Ophthalmological Society' |title=National Retinoblastoma Strategy Canadian Guidelines for Care; Genetic Analysis |journal=Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=44 |issue=suppl.2 |pages=S17–S22 |year=2009 |month=December |url=http://www.eyesite.ca/resources/CPGs/COS_RetinoblastomaCPGs_Dec09.pdf}}</ref>
