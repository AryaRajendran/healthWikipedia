'''Distal renal tubular acidosis''' (dRTA) or Type 1 [[Renal tubular acidosis]] (RTA) is the classical form of RTA, being the first described. Distal RTA is characterized by a failure of acid secretion by the alpha intercalated [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of the [[cortical collecting duct]] of the [[distal]] [[nephron]]. This failure of acid secretion may be due to a number of causes, and it leads to an inability to acidify the urine to a [[pH]] of less than 5.3.

== Symptoms ==
Because renal excretion is the primary means of eliminating acid from the body, there is consequently a tendency towards [[acidemia]].
This leads to the clinical features of dRTA;.<ref name=laing>{{cite journal |author=Laing CM, Toye AM, Capasso G, Unwin RJ |title=Renal tubular acidosis: developments in our understanding of the molecular basis |journal=Int.

*[[Nephrocalcinosis]] (deposition of [[calcium]] in the substance of the kidney)

The symptoms and sequelae of dRTA are variable and ranging from being completely [[asymptomatic]], through [[loin]] pain and [[hematuria]] from [[kidney stones]] to [[failure to thrive]] and severe [[rickets]] in childhood forms as well as possible [[renal failure]] and even death. 

dRTA commonly leads to sodium loss and volume contraction, which causes a compensatory increase in blood levels of [[aldosterone]].<ref name=Wein_Urology1045>{{cite book|last=Wein|first=Alan, J|title=Campbell-walsh Urology Expert Consult.|year=2011|publisher=W B Saunders Co|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-6911-9|pages=1045|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/das/book/pdf/282455359-3/978-1-4160-6911-9/4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-6911-9..00038-4..DOCPDF.pdf?isbn=978-1-4160-6911-9&eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-6911-9..00038-4..DOCPDF|edition=10th}}</ref> Aldosterone causes increased resorption of sodium and loss of potassium in the collecting duct of the kidney, so these increased aldosterone levels cause the hypokalemia which is a common symptom of dRTA.<ref name=Wein_Urology1045 />

== Diagnosis ==
The acidosis is variable, and one may have dRTA with [[alpha intercalated cell]] failure without necessarily being acidemic, this is termed ''incomplete dRTA''. The diagnosis of dRTA can be made by the observation of a urinary [[pH]] of greater than 5.3 in the face of a systemic acidemia (usually taken to be a serum bicarbonate of 20 [[mmol]]/[[litre|l]] or less). In the case of an incomplete dRTA, failure to acidify the urine following an oral acid loading challenge is often used as a test.  The test usually performed is ''the short [[ammonium chloride]] test'',<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Wrong |first= O|authorlink= |coauthors=Davies HEF |year= 1959|month= |title=The Excretion of Acid in Renal Disease |journal=QJM |volume= 28|issue= 110|pages=259–313 |id= |url= |accessdate= |pmid= 13658353 }}</ref> in which ammonium chloride capsules are used as the acid load. More recently, an alternative test using [[furosemide]] and [[fludrocortisone]] has been described.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsh SB, Shirley DG, Wrong OM, Unwin RJ |title=Urinary acidification assessed by simultaneous furosemide and fludrocortisone treatment: an alternative to ammonium chloride |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=71 |issue=12 |pages=1310–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17410104 |doi=10.1038/sj.ki.5002220 |url=}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
This is relatively straightforward. It involves correction of the acidemia with oral [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[sodium citrate]] or [[potassium citrate]]. This will correct the acidemia and reverse bone demineralisation. Hypokalemia and urinary stone formation and nephrocalcinosis can be treated with [[potassium citrate]] tablets which not only replace potassium but also inhibit calcium excretion and thus do not exacerbate stone disease as sodium bicarbonate or citrate may do.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morris RC, Sebastian A |title=Alkali therapy in renal tubular acidosis: who needs it? |journal=J.
