== Cause ==
The Mongolian spot is a [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] developmental condition exclusively involving the [[skin]]. The blue colour is caused by [[melanocyte]]s, [[melanin]]-containing cells, that are usually located in the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] but are in the deeper region of the skin known as the dermis in the location of the spot. <ref name=skin /> Usually, as multiple spots or one large patch, it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area (lower [[Human back|back]]), the [[buttock]]s, sides, and [[shoulder]]s.<ref name=skin /> It results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the lower half to two-thirds of the [[dermis]] during their migration from the [[neural crest]] to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] during [[embryo]]nic development.<ref name=skin />

The condition is unrelated to gender; male and female infants are equally predisposed to Mongolian spot.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Among those who are not aware of the background of the Mongolian spots, it may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise, possibly resulting in unfounded concerns about abuse.<ref>[http://www.tokyo-med.ac.jp/genet/msp/index.htm Mongolian Spot] - English information of Mongolian spot, written by Hironao NUMABE, M.D., Tokyo Medical University.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Empson|first=Rebecca M.|title=Harnessing fortune : personhood, memory and place in northeast Mongolia|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780197264737}}</ref>

== Prevalence ==
Rough estimates are that the Mongolian spots are most prevalent among infants of [[East Asians|East Asian]] groups, American Indian 80-85%, and black infants{{citation_needed|date=November 2012}}. Infants may be born with one or more Mongolian spots ranging from small area on the buttocks to a larger area on the back. They also occur in about 90-95% and about 80-85% of East African and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] infants, respectively.<ref name=tokyo>[http://www.tokyo-med.ac.jp/genet/msp/about.htm About Mongolian spot]</ref> Approximately 90% of Polynesians and Micronesians are born with Mongolian spots, as are about 46% of Latin American children.<ref name=med>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1068732-overview#a0199 Epidemiology of Mongolian spot on MedScape]</ref> These spots also appear on 5-10% of babies of full Caucasian descent; [[Coria del Río]] in Spain has a high incidence due to the presence of descendants of the first Japanese official envoy to Spain in the early 17th century.<ref name=tokyo>[http://www.tokyo-med.ac.jp/genet/msp/about.htm]</ref><ref>http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20031211b4.html</ref>

== Cultural references ==
The Mongolian spot is referred to in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] idiom ''shiri ga aoi'' (尻が青い), meaning "to have a blue butt," <ref>[[:ja:尻|尻]] {{ja icon}}</ref><ref>[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=727 "The butt is blue": the untold story], [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/ Language Log], October 15, 2008 @ 3:14 pm; comment of October 16, 2008 @ 11:39 am</ref> which is a reference to immaturity or inexperience.
In Mexico, it is referred to as "la patada de Cuauhtémoc", meaning "[[Cuauhtémoc]]'s kick".
In Korea, it is thought that the Mongolian spot is the bruise formed when  [[Samshin halmi]](삼신할미), a Shaman spirit to whom people pray around child birth, has beaten in order for a baby to go out from his or her mother.

In the comedy [[manga]] series [[Joshiraku]] written by [[Kōji Kumeta]], as well as in its [[anime]] adaptation, the character Marii Buratei is known to have a mongolian spot. In one sketch, a westerner notices the spot and mistakes it for child abuse, blaming "barbarian Japanese" and taking Marii to "safety" abroad, against her wishes.
