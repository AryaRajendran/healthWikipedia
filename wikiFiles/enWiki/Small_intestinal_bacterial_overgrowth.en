'''Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth''' ('''SIBO'''), also termed '''bacterial overgrowth''', or '''Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome''' ('''SBBOS'''), is a disorder of excessive bacterial growth in the [[small intestine]].  Unlike the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] (or large bowel), which is rich with [[bacteria]], the small bowel usually has fewer than 10<sup>4</sup> organisms per milliliter.<!--

The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of bacterial overgrowth is made by a number of techniques, with the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] diagnosis being an [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspirate]] from the [[jejunum]] that grows in excess of 10<sup>5</sup> [[bacteria]] per millilitre.  [[Risk factor]]s for the development of bacterial overgrowth include the use of medications, possibly including [[proton pump inhibitors]], [[anatomy|anatomical]] disturbances in the bowel, including [[fistula]]e, [[diverticula]] and blind loops created after surgery, and resection of the [[ileo-cecal valve]].  Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome is treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which may be given in a cyclic fashion to prevent tolerance to the antibiotics.

==Clinical presentation==
[[Image:Cobalmin.png|right|thumb|[[vitamin B12 deficiency|Deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] can occur in bacterial overgrowth]]
Bacterial overgrowth can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s, many of which are also found in other conditions, making the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] challenging at times.<!--

-->Many of the symptoms are due to [[malabsorption]] of nutrients due to the effects of bacteria which either metabolize nutrients or cause inflammation of the small bowel impairing absorption.  The symptoms of bacterial overgrowth include [[nausea]], [[bloating]], [[flatus]], [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[diarrhea]], and [[constipation]].<!--

Some patients may develop abdominal discomfort and lose weight.  Children with bacterial overgrowth may develop [[malnutrition]] and have difficulty attaining [[failure to thrive|proper growth]].  [[Steatorrhea]] is a sticky type of diarrhea, where [[lipid]]s are malabsorbed and spill into the stool.<!--
  --><ref name="Kirsch"/><!--
-->

Patients with bacterial overgrowth that is longstanding can develop complications of their illness as a result of malabsorption of nutrients.  [[Anemia]] may occur from a variety of mechanisms, as many of the nutrients involved in production of [[red blood cell]]s are absorbed in the affected small bowel.  [[Iron]] is absorbed in the more proximal parts of the small bowel, the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]], and patients with malabsorption of iron can develop a [[microcytic anemia]], with small red blood cells. [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] is absorbed in the last part of the small bowel, the [[ileum]], and patients who malabsorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can develop a [[megaloblastic anemia]] with large red blood cells.<ref name=Kirsch/>
In older adults, small bowel bacterial overgrowth is associated with a higher frequency of [[diarrhea]], a lower [[body mass index]], and a significanly lower [[serum albumin]] concentration.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Parlesak | first = A |last2= Klein|first2=B |last3=Schecher |first3=K |last4=Bode |first4=JC | last5=Bode |first5=C |year=2003 |title = Prevalence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth and its association with nutrition intake in nonhospitalized older adults. | journal = J Am Geriatrics Soc | volume = 51 | issue = 6 | pages = 768–773 | publisher = | location = | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.51259.x/abstract;jsessionid=7ACED320AD00CEA2C3B567106EA6570E.d04t02| doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.51259.x| id = | accessdate = | pmid = 12757562 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|''E. coli'', shown in this electron micrograph, is commonly isolated in patients with bacterial overgrowth]]

Certain species of bacteria are more commonly found in aspirates of the [[jejunum]] taken from patients with bacterial overgrowth.  The most common isolates are ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'', and ''[[Enterococcus]]'' species.<!--

Soon after birth, the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is colonized with bacteria, which, on the basis of models with animals raised in a germ-free environment, have beneficial effects on function of the gastrointestinal tract.  There are 500-1000 different species of bacteria that reside in the bowel.<!--

-->However, if the flora of the small bowel is altered, inflammation or altered digestion can occur, leading to symptoms.  Many patients with chronic diarrhea have bacterial overgrowth as a cause or a contributor to their symptoms.<ref name=Teo/>  

While the consensus definition of chronic diarrhea varies, in general it is considered to be an alteration in stool consistency or increased frequency, that occurs for over three weeks.  Various mechanisms are involved in the development of diarrhea in bacterial overgrowth.  First, the excessive bacterial concentrations can cause direct inflammation of the small bowel cells, leading to an ''inflammatory'' diarrhea.  The malabsorption of [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s may cause poorly digestible products to enter into the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].  This can cause diarrhea by the [[osmosis|osmotic drive]] of these molecules, but can also stimulate the secretory mechanisms of colonic cells, leading to a ''secretory diarrhea''.<ref name=Kirsch/>

==Risk factors and causes==
[[Image:Ileocecal valve.jpg|thumb|right|The [[ileocecal valve]] prevents reflux of bacteria from the colon into the small bowel.  Resection of the valve can lead to bacterial overgrowth]]

Certain patients are more predisposed to the development of bacterial overgrowth because of certain risk factors.  These factors can be grouped into three categories: (1) disordered [[motility]] or movement of the small bowel or anatomical changes that lead to [[stasis (medicine)|stasis]], (2) disorders in the [[immune system]] and (3) conditions that cause more bacteria from the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] to enter the [[small bowel]].<ref name=Quigley/>

Problems with motility may either be diffuse, or localized to particular areas.  Diseases like [[scleroderma]]<!--

-->  After surgery involving the [[stomach]] and [[duodenum]] (most commonly with [[Billroth II]] antrectomy), a ''blind loop'' may be formed, leading to stasis of flow of intestinal contents.  This can cause overgrowth, and is termed ''blind loop syndrome''.<!--

-->

Disorders of the immune system can cause bacterial overgrowth.  Chronic [[pancreatitis]], or inflammation of the [[pancreas]] can cause bacterial overgrowth through mechanisms linked to this.<!--
   --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Trespi E, Ferrieri A | title = Intestinal bacterial overgrowth during chronic pancreatitis | journal = Curr Med Res Opin | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–52 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10216811 | doi = 10.1185/03007999909115173}}</ref>  <!--

-->

Finally, abnormal connections between the [[bacteria]]-rich colon and the small bowel can increase the bacterial load in the small bowel.  Patients with [[Crohn's disease]] or other diseases of the [[ileum]] may require surgery that removes the [[ileocecal valve]] connecting the small and large bowel; this leads to an increased reflux of bacteria into the small bowel.<!--

In recent years, several proposed links between SIBO and other disorders have been made. However, the usual methodology of these studies involves the use of breath testing as an indirect investigation for SIBO. Breath testing has been critizised by some authors for being an imperfect test for SIBO, with multiple known false positives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simrén|first=M|coauthors=Stotzer, PO|title=Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests.|journal=Gut|date=2006 Mar|volume=55|issue=3|pages=297–303|pmid=16474100}}</ref>

===Proposed link with Irritable bowel syndrome===
{{main|Irritable bowel syndrome}}

Some studies reported up to 80% of patients with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) have SIBO, (using the [[hydrogen breath test]]). Subsequent studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction in IBS symptoms following therapy for SIBO.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pimentel|first=Mark|title=A new IBS solution : bacteria, the missing link in treating irritable bowel syndrome|year=2006|publisher=Health Point Press|location=Sherman Oaks, CA|isbn=0977435601}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Reddymasu|first=SC|coauthors=Sostarich, S; McCallum, RW|title=Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in irritable bowel syndrome: are there any predictors?|journal=BMC gastroenterology|date=2010 Feb 22|volume=10|pages=23|pmid=20175924}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=HC|title=Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: a framework for understanding irritable bowel syndrome.|journal=JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association|date=2004 Aug 18|volume=292|issue=7|pages=852–8|pmid=15316000}}</ref> 

There is a lack of consensus however, regarding the suggested link between IBS and SIBO. Other authors concluded that the abnormal breath results so common in IBS patients do not suggest SIBO, and state that "abnormal fermentation timing and dynamics of the breath test findings support a role for abnormal intestinal bacterial distribution in IBS." <ref>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=ED|coauthors=Basseri, RJ; Chong, K; Pimentel, M|title=Abnormal breath testing in IBS: a meta-analysis.|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=2010 Sep|volume=55|issue=9|pages=2441–9|pmid=20467896}}</ref> There is general consensus that breath tests are abnormal in IBS, however the disagreement lies in whether this is representative of SIBO.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=AC|coauthors=Spiegel, BM; Talley, NJ; Moayyedi, P|title=Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association|date=2009 Dec|volume=7|issue=12|pages=1279–86|pmid=19602448}}</ref> More research is needed to clarifiy this possible link.

===Proposed link with Fibromyalgia===
{{main|fibromyalgia}}
Fybromyalgia is a poorly understood pain condition. Lactulose breath testing has shown that patients with [[fibromyalgia]] have a more pronounced degree of abnormal results compared to both IBS patients and the general population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pimentel|first=M|coauthors=Wallace, D; Hallegua, D; Chow, E; Kong, Y; Park, S; Lin, HC|title=A link between irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia may be related to findings on lactulose breath testing.|journal=Annals of the rheumatic diseases|date=2004 Apr|volume=63|issue=4|pages=450–2|pmid=15020342}}</ref> This study also demonstrated positive correlation between the amount of pain and the degree of abnormality on the breath test.

===Proposed link with Rosacea===
{{main|Rosacea}}
Intestinal bacteria may play an etiological role in the dermatological condition Rosacea.  A recent study subjected patients to a [[hydrogen breath test]] to detect the occurrence of SIBO.  It was found that significantly more patients were hydrogen-positive than controls indicating the presence of bacterial overgrowth (47% v. 5%, p<0.001).

Hydrogen-positive patients were then given a 10-day course of [[rifaximin]], a non-absorbable antibiotic that does not leave the digestive tract and therefore does not enter the circulation or reach the skin.  96% of patients experienced a complete remission of rosacea symptoms that lasted beyond 9 months.  These patients were also negative when retested for bacterial overgrowth.  In the 4% of patients that experienced relapse, it was found that bacterial overgrowth had returned.  These patients were given a second course of rifaximin which again cleared rosacea symptoms and normalized hydrogen excretion.<ref name="ClinGastroenterolHepatol2008-ParodiA,PaolinoS,GrecoA,DragoF,MansiC,ReboraA,ParodiAU,SavarinoV">{{cite journal | author=Parodi A,Paolino S,Greco A,Drago F,Mansi C,Rebora A,Parodi AU,Savarino V | title=Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Rosacea: Clinical Effectiveness of Its Eradication | journal=Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. | month=May | year=2008 | pmid=18456568 | doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2008.02.054 | volume=6 | pages=759–64 | issue=7}}</ref>

In another study, it was found that some rosacea patients that tested hydrogen-negative were still positive for bacterial overgrowth when using a [[hydrogen breath test|methane breath test]] instead.  These patients showed little improvement with rifaximin, as found in the previous study, but experienced clearance of rosacea symptoms and normalization of methane excretion following administration of the antibiotic [[metronidazole]], which is effective at targeting methanogenic intestinal bacteria.<ref>[http://uegw08.uegf.org/scienpro/abstract_detail.php?navId=139&ss=1814 UEGW Vienna 2008 - 16th United European Gastroenterology Week<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

These results suggest that optimal antibiotic therapy may vary between patients and that diverse species of intestinal bacteria appear to be capable of mediating rosacea symptoms.

This may also explain the improvement in symptoms experienced by some patients when given a reduced carbohydrate diet.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pdf_extract/1/5485/459 Intestinal Disaccharidase Activity in Rosacea - Paton et al. 1 (5485): 459 - British Medical Journal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Such a diet would restrict the available material necessary for bacterial [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and thereby reduce intestinal bacterial populations.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|right|thumb|Aspiration of from the [[jejunum]] is the gold standard for diagnosis.  A bacterial load of greater than 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per milillitre is diagnostic for bacterial overgrowth]]

The diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth can be made by physicians in various ways.  [[Malabsorption]] can be detected by a test called the ''D-xylose'' test.  [[Xylose]] is a sugar that does not require enzymes to be digested.  The [[D-Xylose absorption test|D-xylose test]] involves having a patient drink a certain quantity of D-xylose, and measuring levels in the [[urine]] and [[blood]]; if there is no evidence of D-xylose in the [[urine]] and [[blood]], it suggests that the small bowel is not absorbing properly (as opposed to problems with enzymes required for digestion).<!--

-->

The gold standard for detection of bacterial overgrowth is the aspiration of more than 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per millilitre from the small bowel.  The normal small bowel has less than 10<sup>4</sup> bacteria per millilitre.<!--

[[Image:Coeliac path.jpg|thumb|Biopsies of the small bowel in bacterial overgrowth can mimic [[celiac disease]], with partial [[villi|villous]] atrophy.]]
Breath tests have been developed to test for bacterial overgrowth, based on bacterial metabolism of [[carbohydrates]] to [[hydrogen]], or based on the detection of by-products of digestion of carbohydrates that are not usually metabolized.  The [[hydrogen breath test]] involves giving patients a load of carbohydrate (usually in the form of [[rice]]) and measuring expired hydrogen concentrations after a certain time.  It compares well to jejunal aspirates in making the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth.<!--

--><sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C based tests have also been developed based on the bacterial metabolism of D-xylose.  Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids.

Some patients with symptoms of [[bacterial overgrowth]] will undergo [[gastroscopy]], or visualization of the stomach and duodenum with an endoscopic [[camera]].  Biopsies of the small bowel in [[bacterial overgrowth]] can mimic those of [[celiac disease]], making the diagnosis more challenging.  Findings include blunting of [[villi]], hyperplasia of crypts and an increased number of [[lymphocyte]]s in the [[lamina propria]].<!--

-->

However, some physicians suggest that if the suspicion of bacterial overgrowth is high enough, the best diagnostic test is a trial of treatment.  If the symptoms improve, an empiric diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth can be made.<!--

==Treatment==
Bacterial overgrowth is usually treated with a course of antibiotics.  A variety of antibiotics, including [[neomycin]], [[rifaximin]], [[amoxicillin-clavulanate]], [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics and [[tetracycline]] have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of [[norfloxacin]] and [[amoxicillin-clavulanate]].<!--

A course of one week of antibiotics is usually sufficient to treat the condition.  However, if the condition recurs, antibiotics can be given in a cyclical fashion in order to prevent tolerance.  For example, antibiotics may be given for a week, followed by three weeks off antibiotics, followed by another week of treatment.  Alternatively, the choice of antibiotic used can be cycled.<ref name=Singh/>

The condition that predisposed the patient to bacterial overgrowth should also be treated.  For example, if the bacterial overgrowth is caused by [[chronic pancreatitis]], the patient should be treated with coated pancreatic [[enzyme]] supplements.

[[Probiotic]]s are bacterial preparations that alter the bacterial flora in the bowel to cause a beneficial effect.  Their role in bacterial overgrowth is somewhat uncertain.<ref name=Quigley/>

A diet void of certain foods that feed the bacteria can help alleviate the symptoms. For example if the symptoms are caused by bacterial overgrowth on complex carbohydrate rich foods (for example bread), eating light food consisting of fruits and green leafy vegetables may substantially lessen the symptoms.
