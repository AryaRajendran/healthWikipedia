'''Alcohol and weight''' is a subject relevant to millions of people who like to drink [[alcoholic beverage]]s and who also either want to maintain or to lose [[body weight]].  It is uncertain whether  alcohol leads to increased body weight.  Some studies find an increase in body weight, some studies do not, and some find a small decrease among women who begin consuming alcohol <ref>{{cite journal |author=Cordain L, Bryan ED, Melby CL, Smith MJ |title=Influence of moderate daily wine consumption on body weight regulation and metabolism in healthy free-living males |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=134–9 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9100213 |url=http://intl.jacn.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/2/134}}</ref><ref>

</ref>  Some of these studies are very large; one involved nearly 80,000 and another included 140,000 subjects.

These findings are inconclusive because alcohol itself contains 7 [[calorie]]s per gram, and most alcoholic drinks also contain [[carbohydrate]]s. The reason that alcohol may not increase weight is unclear, but research suggests that alcohol energy is not efficiently used. Alcohol also appears to increase [[Metabolism|metabolic rate]] significantly, thus causing more calories to be burned rather than stored in the body as [[fat]] (Klesges ''et al.'', 1994). Other research has found consumption of [[sugar]] to decrease as consumption of alcohol increases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The research results do not necessarily mean that people who wish to lose weight should continue to consume alcohol because consumption is known to have an enhancing effect on appetite. Due to these discrepancies in findings, the relationship between alcohol and weight remains unresolved and requires further research.

Biological and environmental factors are thought to contribute to alcoholism and obesity.<ref name="Alcohol Studies 2003">UNC Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. Alcoholism and Obesity: Overlapping Brain Pathways? Center Line. Vol 14, 2003.</ref> The physiologic commonalities between excessive eating and excessive alcohol drinking shed light on intervention strategies, such as pharmaceutical compounds that may help those who suffer from both.
Some of the brain signaling proteins that mediate excessive eating and weight gain also mediate uncontrolled alcohol consumption.<ref name="Alcohol Studies 2003"/> Some physiological substrates that underlie food intake and alcohol intake have been identified. Melanocortins, a group of signaling proteins, are found to be involved in both excessive food intake and alcohol intake.<ref>Thiele et al. Overlapping Peptide Control of Alcohol Self-Administration and Feeding. Alcohol Clin Exp Res, Vol 28, No 2, 2004: pp 288–294.</ref>

Alcohol may contribute to obesity. A study found frequent, light drinkers (three to seven drinking days per week, one drink per drinking day) had lower BMIs than infrequent, but heavier drinkers.<ref name="Breslow 2001">Breslow et al.
