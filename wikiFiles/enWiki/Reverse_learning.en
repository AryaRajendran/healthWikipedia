'''Reverse learning''' is a [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] theory of [[dream]]s. In 1983, in a paper<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/304111a0 |title=The function of dream sleep |year=1983 |last1=Crick |first1=Francis |first2=Graeme |journal=Nature |volume=304 |pages=111–4 |pmid=6866101 |issue=5922 |last2=Mitchison}}</ref> published in the famous science journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], [[Francis Crick|Crick]] and Mitchison's reverse learning model likened the process of dreaming to a [[computer]] in that it was "off-line" during dreaming  or the [[REM sleep|REM]] phase of sleep.  During this phase, the brain supposedly sifts through information gathered throughout the day and throws out all unwanted material. According to the model, we dream in order to forget and this involves a process of 'reverse learning' or 'unlearning'. Reverse learning eliminates unwanted modes of neural network interaction acquired in the adult mammal's learning and also in the process of fetal brain growth; therefore, there is a possibility that abnormalities of reverse learning in the fetal brain might explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes or other neurodevelopmental disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8951804 |year=1996 |author1=Brown |title=Autism, Asperger's syndrome and the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of REM sleep |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=399–403 |journal=Medical hypotheses |doi=10.1016/S0306-9877(96)90220-0}}</ref>

The [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] cannot cope with the vast amount of information received throughout the day without developing "parasitic" thoughts that would disrupt the efficient organisation of [[memory]]. During [[REM sleep]], these unwanted connections in cortical networks are supposedly wiped out or damped down by the Crick-Mitchison process making use of impulses bombarding the cortex from [[brainstem|sub-cortical]] areas.

The Crick-Mitchison theory is a variant upon [[Allan Hobson|Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley|McCarley's]] [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21570 |year=1977 |author1=Hobson |first2=RW |title=The brain as a dream state generator: an activation-synthesis hypothesis of the dream process |volume=134 |issue=12 |pages=1335–48 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |last2=McCarley}}</ref> published in December 1977. Hobson and McCarley hypothesized that a [[brainstem|brain stem]] neuronal mechanism sends [[PGO waves|pontine-geniculo-occipital (or PGO) waves]] that automatically activate the mammalian [[forebrain]]. By comparing information generated in specific brain areas with information stored in memory, the forebrain synthesizes dreams during REM sleep.

[[Michel Jouvet|Jouvet]] and many other prominent sleep researchers have their own their theories of REM sleep. Is the Crick-Mitchison theory of REM sleep an error, a partially correct insight, or a vague first step toward an important unifying in the theory of REM sleep and mammalian brain function?

==Crick ''verbatim'' on the function of REM sleep==
Suppose one did not have REM, then one would mix things up. That is not necessarily a bad thing - it is the basis of fantasy, imagination, and so forth. Imagination means seeing a connection between two things that are different but which have something in common which you had not noticed before. If one had too much REM, one would predict one would be a rather prosaic person without too much imagination. But the process is not 100% efficient. If one goes on too far, one begins to wipe out everything.

Another way to look at it is to say "How could you prevent the brain being overloaded"? One way would be to make it bigger, to have more neurons. So perhaps the important thing to say is "The function of REM is to allow your brain or your cortex to be smaller".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01117331 |title=Neural networks and REM sleep |year=1988 |last1=Crick |first1=Francis |journal=Bioscience Reports |volume=8 |pages=531–5 |pmid=3242640 |issue=6}}</ref>

==Support for the theory of reverse learning==
In the [[echidna]], a primitive egg-laying mammal that has no [[REM sleep]], there is a very enlarged frontal cortex.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.982039 |title=Sleep in mammals: ecological and constitutional correlates |year=1976 |last1=Allison |first1=T |first2=D. |journal=Science |volume=194 |pages=732–4 |pmid=982039 |issue=4266 |last2=Cicchetti}}</ref> Crick and Mitchison argue that this excessive cortical development is necessary to store both adaptive memories and parasitic memories, which in more highly evolved animals are disposed of during REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6866101 |doi=10.1038/304111a0 |year=1983 |author1=Crick |first2=G |title=The function of dream sleep |volume=304 |issue=5922 |pages=111–4 |journal=Nature |last2=Mitchison}}</ref>

This theory solves the brain information storage problem, as our cortex would need to be much larger due to the inefficient storage of information. It also explains why we forget dreams extremely easily.

==Objections to the theory of reverse learning==
One problem for reverse-learning theory is that dreams are often organized into clear [[narratives]] (stories).  It is unclear why dreams would be organized in a [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] way if they consisted only of disposable [[parasitic]] thoughts.  It is also unclear why babies [[sleep]] so much, because it seems they would have less to forget. Additionally, the [[brain]] of the [[echidna]] has far less folding than the brains of other [[mammals]], so has less surface area (the location of the [[neo-cortex]]). It may actually have less capacity for higher thought than that of other mammals, rather than more, as its greater mass suggests.

In response to these objections, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the principal target for the unlearning process could be obsessive memories (strong attractors) and that the dream/REM purpose is to equalize the strength of memories.

A computational model by Kinouchi and Kinouchi (2002) implementing a [[chaotic itinerancy]] dynamics in a [[Hopfield net]] shows that the Crick-Mitchison unlearning mechanism produces a trajectory of associated [[attractors]] ("a narrative") where the strong ("emotional", "obsessive" or "overplastic") memories have their dominance downplayed and an equalization between memory basins produces a better recovery of memories not recalled during the "dream".<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=cond-mat/0208590v2 |author1=Osame Kinouchi |title=Dreams, endocannabinoids and itinerant dynamics in neural networks: re elaborating Crick-Mitchison unlearning hypothesis |class=cond-mat.dis-nn |year=2002 |author2=Renato Rodrigues Kinouchi}}</ref>

It is argued that fetuses and babies sleep so much to downgrade ("unlearn") the force of synapses present in these developmental phases.

There is not much evidence to suggest that our brain is actively forgetting during sleep. In fact, it seems to be the exact opposite, where sleep helps consolidate memories instead.<ref>Walker, M. P.
