The term was named after [[France|French]] [[surgeon]], [[Jean-Nicolas Marjolin]], who first described the condition in 1828.<ref name=pmid15758002>{{cite journal |author=Chong AJ, Klein MB |title=Images in clinical medicine.

==Appearance==
Slow growth, painlessness (as the ulcer is usually not associated with [[nerve]] tissue), and absence of [[lymph]]atic spread due to local destruction of lymphatic channels.<ref name=pmid9567417>{{cite journal |author=Paredes F |title=[Marjölin ulcer] |language=Portuguese |journal=Acta Med Port |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=185–7 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9567417 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[Histology|Histologically]], the tumour is a well-[[Grading (tumors)|differentiated]] squamous cell carcinoma.  This carcinoma is aggressive in nature, spreads locally and is associated with a poor [[prognosis]].<ref name=pmid15758002/>
40% occur on the lower limb and the malignant change is usually painless. This malignant change of the wound happens a long time after initial trauma, usually 10–25 years later.its edge is everted and not always raised

==Diagnosis==
Wedge biopsy is the favored method of diagnosis.  [[Biological tissue|Tissue]] specimens obtained should be taken from both the centre and margin of [[lesion]], as the central ulcerated deposits may be [[necrosis|necrotic]].

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually surgical, with a wide [[:wikt:excision|excision]] of the [[lesion]]; typically a 1&nbsp;cm margin all around is required.
Radiation therapy is also a good alternative in most cases.
