==Mission==
The mission of Albert Einstein College of Medicine is to prepare physicians and researchers to excel in the science and the art of medicine and basic, [[translational medicine|translational]] and clinical investigation. Its founding mandate is to combine the pursuit of scientific excellence with a social mission to improve human health through engagement in local, national and global communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.yu.edu/education/md-program/md-program.aspx?id=14454 |title=Albert Einstein College of Medicine: |publisher=Einstein.yu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref>

==History==

Yeshiva University President Dr. Samuel Belkin began planning for a new medical school as early as 1945. Six years later, Dr. Belkin and [[New York City Mayor]] [[Vincent Impellitteri]] entered into an agreement to begin construction. At the same time, world-renowned physicist and humanitarian [[Albert Einstein]] sent a letter to Dr. Belkin.  He remarked that such an endeavor would be “unique” in that the school would “welcome students of all creeds and races.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.yu.edu/home/history_einstein_letter.asp |title=Einstein: Albert Einstein College of Medicine |publisher=Einstein.yu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref> Two years later, on his 74th birthday, March 14, 1953, Albert Einstein agreed to attach his name to the medical school.

The first classes began September 12, 1955, and had a total of 56 students. At the time, it was the first new medical school to be erected within [[New York City]] since 1897. The Sue Golding Graduate Division was established in 1957 to offer Ph.D.s in biomedical disciplines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.yu.edu/home/history.asp |title=History &#124; Albert Einstein College of Medicine |publisher=Einstein.yu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref> The [[Medical Scientist Training Program]] (MSTP), a combined M.D./Ph.D. program, was first offered in 1964.<ref>[http://mstp.einstein.yu.edu/ "Welcome to the MSTP @ Einstein!"], Albert Einstein College of Medicine website.</ref> The C.R.T.P. (Clinical Research Training Program), which confers M.S. degrees in clinical research methods, began classes in July 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.yu.edu/ictr/page.aspx?id=12468&ekmensel=942_submenu_1258_link_1 |title=CRTP Home &#124; Clinical & Translational Research &#124; Albert Einstein College of Medicine |publisher=Einstein.yu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>

==Allegations of discrimination==
The College of Medicine has been the center of several allegations of discrimination. In 1994, the College was sued by Heidi Weissmann, a researcher in nuclear medicine and former associate professor of radiology, for sexual discrimination for not promoting her due to gender bias. The College settled the case for $900,000.
