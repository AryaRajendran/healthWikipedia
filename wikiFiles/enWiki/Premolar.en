The '''premolar''' [[Tooth (human)|teeth]] are transitional teeth located between the [[Canine tooth|canine]] and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth. In humans, there are two premolars per [[Circular sector|quadrant]], making eight premolars total in the mouth.<ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritish"/><ref name=" Weiss&Mann1985"/><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded"/>  They have at least two [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]].  Premolars can be considered as a 'transitional tooth' during chewing, or [[mastication]]. It has properties of both the [[anterior]] canines and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] molars, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines to the molars.<ref name=" Weiss&Mann1985pp132-134"/>

The premolars in humans are the [[maxillary first premolar]], [[maxillary second premolar]], [[mandibular first premolar]], and the [[mandibular second premolar]].<ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritish"/><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded"/> 

There is always one large [[cheek|buccal]] cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar. The lower second premolar almost always presents with two [[tongue|lingual]] cusps.<ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritishp1219"/>

Molar teeth by definition are permanent teeth [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] to the [[canine tooth|canine]]s, preceded by [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] premolars.<ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritishpp1218-1219"/>
In primitive [[Eutheria|placental mammal]]s there are four premolars per quadrant. The most [[mesial]] two have been lost in [[Catarrhines]] ([[Cercopithecoidea|Old World monkeys]] and [[Hominoidea|apes]], including [[homo (genus)|humans]]). [[Paleontologists]] refer to human premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.<ref name="encylopediahumanevolution"/>
