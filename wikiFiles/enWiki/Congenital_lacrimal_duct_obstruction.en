'''Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction''' (CLDO) is the condition in which a [[lacrimal duct|tear duct]] has failed to open at the time of birth. Around 6% of infants have CLDO, usually experiencing a persistent watery eye even when not crying.  The condition is also known as dacryostenosis.<ref> Blocked tear ducts in infants, Pediatric Views, June 2006 http://www.childrenshospital.org/views/june06/blocked_tear_ducts.html</ref> If a secondary infection occurs ([[Dacryocystitis]]), purulent (yellow / green) discharge may be present.

==Prognosis and treatment==
Most cases resolve spontaneously, with [[antibiotic]]s reserved only if [[conjunctivitis]] occurs. Lacrimal sac massage has been proposed as helping to open the duct, though this is not always successful.<ref name="pmid9274552">{{cite journal |author=Young JD, MacEwen CJ |title=Managing congenital lacrimal obstruction in general practice |journal=BMJ |volume=315 |issue=7103 |pages=293–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9274552 |doi= |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/315/7103/293 |pmc=2127215}}</ref> The aim of massage is to generate enough hydrostatic pressure (downward, toward the nose) to "pop" open any obstruction.  Additional massage may then be performed up toward the [[lacrimal punctum]], in order to express any infectious material out of the [[nasolacrimal sac]].  When discharge or crusting is present, the lids should be gently cleaned using cooled pre-boiled water or saline. 

Referral to an [[ophthalmologist]] is indicated if symptoms are still present at 12 months, or sooner if significant symptoms or recurrent infections occur.  [[Nasolacrimal duct probing]] may be performed in the office setting (usually from 4 to 8 months of age) or under general anesthesia in an operating room for older patients.  The success rate of probing is higher for younger children.  A [[silastic]] tube or [[stent]] may be employed along with probing to maintain tear duct patency.<ref name="pmid17307001">{{cite journal |author=Engel JM, Hichie-Schmidt C, Khammar A, Ostfeld BM, Vyas A, Ticho BH |title=Monocanalicular silastic intubation for the initial correction of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction |journal=J Aapos |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=183–186 |year=2007 |pmid=17307001 |doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2006.09.009}}</ref>
