'''Alcohol withdrawal syndrome''' is the set of symptoms seen when an individual reduces or stops alcohol consumption after prolonged periods of excessive alcohol intake. Excessive use of alcohol leads to [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], and an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The withdrawal syndrome is largely due to the [[central nervous system]] being in a hyper-excitable state. The withdrawal syndrome can include seizures and [[delirium tremens]] and may lead to [[excito-neurotoxicity]].<ref name="Alcohol withdrawal seizures"/>

[[Sedative|Sedative-hypnotics]], such as alcohol, are well known for their propensity to induce [[physiological dependence]]. Alcohol withdrawal occurs as a result of neuro-adaptation resulting from chronic exposure to alcohol. A withdrawal syndrome occurs upon declining blood levels of alcohol which can be alleviated by reintroduction of alcohol or a cross-tolerant agent. Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by neuropsychiatric excitability and autonomic disturbances similar to other sedative-hypnotic drugs. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome.<ref name="Medical Toxicology"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The severity of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome can vary from mild symptoms such as mild sleep disturbances and mild anxiety to very severe and life threatening including [[delirium]], particularly visual hallucinations in severe cases and convulsions (which may result in death).<ref name="eciawap"/> These symptoms initially appear characteristically on waking, due to the fall in the blood alcohol concentration during sleep.<ref>Gelder et al,2005 p188.

==Progression of symptoms==
Typically the severity of the symptoms experienced will depend on the amount and duration of prior alcohol consumption, as well as the number and severity of previous withdrawals. Even the most severe of these symptoms can occur in as little as 2 hours after cessation; therefore, the overall unpredictability necessitates either pre-planned hospitalization, treatment coordinated with a doctor, or at the very least fast access to medical care and a supporting system of friends or family should be introduced prior to addressing detoxification. In many cases, however, symptoms follow a reasonably predictable time frame as exampled below:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Six to 12 hours after the ingestion of the last drink, withdrawal symptoms such as shaking, headache, sweating, anxiety, nausea or vomiting occur. Other comparable symptoms may also exist in this period. Twelve to 24 hours after cessation, the condition may progress to such major symptoms as confusion, hallucinations (with awareness of reality), tremor, agitation, and similar ailments. It's between the 24 and 48 hour period that seizures typically may begin to emerge among the previous symptoms in the period, and this is where the serious risk of mortality begins.
Although most often, the condition begins to improve past the 48 hour mark, it can sometimes continue to increase in severity to delirium tremens, characterized by hallucinations that are indistinguishable from reality, severe confusion, more seizures, high blood pressure and fever which can persist anywhere from 4 to 12 days.

===Protracted withdrawal===
{{See also|Protracted withdrawal syndrome}}
A protracted alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in many alcoholics where withdrawal symptoms continue beyond the acute withdrawal stage but usually at a subacute level of intensity and gradually decreasing with severity over time. This syndrome is also sometimes referred to as the [[post acute withdrawal syndrome]]. Some withdrawal symptoms can linger for at least a year after discontinuation of alcohol. Symptoms can include a craving for alcohol, inability to feel pleasure from normally pleasurable things (also known as [[anhedonia]]), clouding of [[sensorium]], disorientation, nausea and vomiting or headache.<ref name="Alcohol protracted withdrawal syndrome: the role of anhedonia"/> Insomnia is also a common [[protracted withdrawal]] symptom which persists after the acute withdrawal phase of alcohol. Insomnia has also been found to influence relapse rate. Studies have found that magnesium or trazodone can help treat the persisting withdrawal symptom of insomnia in recovering alcoholics. Insomnia can be difficult to treat in alcoholics because many of the traditional sleep aids (e.g. benzodiazepine receptor agonists and barbiturate receptor agonists) work via a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mechanism and are cross tolerant with alcohol. However, [[trazodone]] is not cross tolerant with alcohol.<ref name="Magnesium treatment of primary alcohol-dependent patients during subacute withdrawal: an open pilot study with polysomnography"/><ref name="dpsoteotiaps"/><ref name="stoawwt"/> The acute phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome can also occasionally be protracted. Protracted [[delirium tremens]] has been reported in the medical literature as a possible but unusual feature of alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="Protracted alcohol withdrawal delirium"/>

==Pathophysiology==
Chronic use of [[ethanol|alcohol]] leads to changes in brain chemistry especially in the GABAergic system. Various adaptations occur such as changes in [[gene expression]] and down regulation of [[GABAA receptors|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]]. During acute alcohol withdrawal, changes also occur such as upregulation of alpha4 containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and down regulation of alpha1 and alpha3 containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Neurochemical changes occurring during alcohol withdrawal can be minimized with drugs which are used for acute detoxification. With abstinence from alcohol and cross tolerant drugs these changes in neurochemistry gradually return towards normal.<ref name="Changes in GABA(A) receptor gene expression associated with selective alterations in receptor function and pharmacology after ethanol withdrawal"/><ref name="The pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive stimulus produced by ethanol withdrawal is potentiated by bicuculline and picrotoxinin"/> Adaptations to the [[NMDA]] system also occur as a result of repeated alcohol intoxication and are involved in the hyper-excitability of the central nervous system during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Homocysteine levels which are elevated during chronic drinking increase even further during the withdrawal state and may result in excito-neurotoxicity. Alterations in [[ECG]], in particular an increase in [[QT interval]], and [[EEG]] abnormalities including may occur during early withdrawal.<ref name="Hughes-2009"/> Dysfunction of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] and increased release of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] occur during both acute as well as protracted abstinence from alcohol and contribute to both acute and protracted withdrawal symptoms. [[Anhedonia]]/[[dysphoria]] symptoms, which can persist as part of a [[protracted withdrawal]] may be due to [[dopamine]] underactivity.<ref name="pmid20148778">{{cite journal |author=Heilig M, Egli M, Crabbe JC, Becker HC |title=Acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence and negative affect in alcoholism: are they linked? |journal=Addict Biol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=169–84 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20148778 |pmc=3268458 |doi=10.1111/j.1369-1600.2009.00194.x |url=}}</ref>

===Kindling===
{{See also|Kindling (substance withdrawal)}}
Kindling is the phenomenon where repeated alcohol detoxifications lead to an increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. For example, binge drinkers may initially experience no withdrawal symptoms but with each period of resumption of drinking followed by abstinence their withdrawal symptoms intensify in severity and may eventually result in full blown [[delirium tremens]] with convulsive seizures. [[Alcoholics]] who experience seizures during hospital detoxification have been found to be much more likely to have experienced more previous alcohol detoxification episodes than alcoholics who did not have seizures. Those experiencing previous detoxification are more likely to have more medically complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Kindling can cause complications and may increase the risk of relapse, alcohol-related [[brain damage]] and cognitive deficits. Chronic alcohol misuse and kindling via multiple alcohol withdrawals may lead to permanent alterations in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<ref name="GABA systems, benzodiazepines, and substance dependence"/>

The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and desensitization of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[convulsions]] and [[neurotoxicity]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Binge drinking is associated with increased impulsivity, impairments in [[spatial working memory]] and impaired [[social emotional learning|emotional learning]]. These adverse effects are believed to be due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified multiple times but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be the most important factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the [[amygdala]] and [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref name="Stephens-2008"/>

People in [[adolescence]] who experience multiple withdrawals from [[binge drinking]] show impairments of long-term nonverbal memory. Alcoholics who have had two or more alcohol withdrawals show more frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction than alcoholics who have experienced one or no prior withdrawals. Kindling of neurons is the proposed cause of withdrawal related cognitive damage. Kindling from multiple withdrawals leads to accumulating neuroadaptational changes. Kindling may also be the reason for cognitive damage seen in binge drinkers.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>

==Diagnosis==
Many hospitals use the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol ([[CIWA]]) protocol in order to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount medication needed.<ref name=aws/> When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear, testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and/or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence more clear.

==Treatment==
[[Benzodiazepines]]  are effective for the management of symptoms as well as the prevention of seizures.<ref name="Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal"/>

Treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be managed with various pharmaceutical medications including [[barbiturates]] and [[clonidine]]. Certain vitamins are also an important part of the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

===Benzodiazepines===
Benzodiazepines, such as [[diazepam]] or [[lorazepam]], are the most commonly used drug for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and are generally safe and effective in suppressing alcohol withdrawal signs. [[Chlordiazepoxide]] and [[diazepam]] are the benzodiazepines most commonly used in alcohol detoxification.<ref name="pmid16623205"/> Benzodiazepines can be life saving, particularly if [[delirium tremens]] appears during alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="Prolonged delirium tremens requiring massive doses of medication"/> Benzodiazepines should only be used short term in alcoholics who aren't already dependent on benzodiazepines as benzodiazepines share cross tolerance with [[alcohol|ethanol]] and there is a risk of replacing the addiction with a [[benzodiazepine dependence]] or worse still adding an additional addiction. Furthermore, disrupted GABA benzodiazepine receptor function is part of alcohol dependence and chronic benzodiazepines may prevent full recovery from alcohol induced mental effects.<ref name="Changes in GABAA receptor function and cross-tolerance to ethanol in diazepam-dependent rats"/><ref name="Chronic ethanol produces a decreased sensitivity to the response-disruptive effects of GABA receptor complex antagonists"/> Benzodiazepines have the problem of increasing cravings for alcohol in problem alcohol consumers and they also increase the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers.<ref name="Low-dose diazepam primes motivation for alcohol and alcohol-related semantic networks in problem drinkers"/> The combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol can amplify the adverse psychological effects of each other causing enhanced depressive effects on mood and increase suicidal actions and are generally contraindicated except for alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="Alcohol use and anxiety"/>

===Antipsychotics===
[[Antipsychotic agents]], such as [[haloperidol]], are sometimes used for alcohol withdrawal as an add-on to first-line measures such as benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis.<ref name=aws/> Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal effects (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects. [[Clozapine]], [[olanzapine]] or low potency [[phenothiazines]] (e.g. [[chlorpromazine]]) are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required.<ref name="Desk Reference for Clinical Pharmacology"/>  There is also concern for this class of drugs prolonging the QT interval, sometimes leading to fatal heart dysrhthmias.

===Anticonvulsants===
Some evidence indicates that [[topiramate]]<ref name="Hughes-2009"/> [[carbamazepine]] and other anticonvulsants are effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal however, research is limited.<ref name="Hughes-2009"/><ref name="Treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome with carbamazepine, gabapentin, and nitrous oxide"/> A [[Cochrane review]] similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not statistically significant and noted significant weaknesses in the studies available and recommended further research. The Cochrane Review did note however, that [[paraldehyde]] combined with [[chloral hydrate]] showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to incidence of life threatening side effects and also noted that carbamazapine may have advantages for certain symptoms.<ref name="Minozzi-2010"/> The advantages of carbamazapine demonstrated in one trial are less [[rebound withdrawal]] symptoms and appears to have a higher success rate for abstinence from alcohol post detoxification compared to benzodiazepines.<ref name="The effects of carbamazepine and lorazepam on single versus multiple previous alcohol withdrawals in an outpatient randomized trial"/>

===Baclofen===
[[Baclofen]] has been shown to be as effective as [[diazepam]] in uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome.<ref name="Baclofen in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a comparative study vs diazepam"/>

===Barbiturates===
[[Barbiturates]] are superior to diazepam in the treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes such as [[delirium tremens]] but equally effective in milder cases of alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="Delirium tremens: a double-blind comparison of diazepam and barbital treatment"/>

===Clomethiazole===
[[Clomethiazole]] (Heminevrin) is a non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic with anticonvulsant effects which is active on the barbiturate site of the GABA-A receptor. Clomethiazole also inhibits the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down alcohol in the body. This slows the rate of elimination of alcohol from the body, which helps to relieve the sudden effects of alcohol withdrawal in alcoholics.

===Clonidine===
[[Clonidine]] has demonstrated superior clinical effects in the suppression of alcohol withdrawal symptoms in a head to head comparison study with the benzodiazepine drug [[chlordiazepoxide]].<ref name="Clonidine versus chlordiazepoxide in acute alcohol withdrawal: a preliminary report"/><ref name="Clonidine vs chlordiazepoxide in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome"/><ref name="Clonidine in alcohol withdrawal"/>

===Ethanol===
Alcohol ([[ethanol]]) itself at low doses, but only when given intravenously by medical personnel, has been found to be superior to chlordiazepoxide in the detoxification of alcohol dependent patients. Low dose ethanol as a means of weaning alcoholics off of alcohol was found to produce less profound sleep disturbances during withdrawal.<ref name="Residual effects of ethanol and chlordiazepoxide treatments for alcohol withdrawal"/> Low dose ethanol has been found to reduce treatment time, improve the failure rate from 20% down to 7% and increase retention in treatment centers with an increased rate of alcoholics attending substance misuse clinics after detoxification.<ref name="An ethanol protocol to prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome"/>

===Flumazenil===
[[Flumazenil]], which has shown some promise in the management of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] has also demonstrated benefit in a research study in reducing [[anxiety]] withdrawal related symptomatology during alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="The benzodiazepines: anxiolytic and withdrawal effects"/>

===Trazodone===
[[Trazodone]] has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It may have particular use in withdrawal symptoms, especially insomnia, persisting beyond the acute withdrawal phase.<ref name=dpsoteotiaps/><ref name=stoawwt/><ref name="Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: treatment with trazodone"/>

===Magnesium===
Magnesium appears to be effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal related [[cardiac arrhythmias]]. It is ineffective in controlling other symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of magnesium sulfate in the ethanol withdrawal syndrome">{{cite journal |author=Wilson A, Vulcano B |title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of magnesium sulfate in the ethanol withdrawal syndrome |journal=Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=542–5 |year=1984 |pmid=6393805 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1984.tb05726.x|url=}}</ref>

===Nitrous Oxide===
Nitrous oxide has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for alcohol withdrawal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|coauthors=Lichtigfeld FJ|title=Placebo and analgesic nitrous oxide for treatment of the alcohol withdrawal state.|journal=Brit J Psychiatry|year=1991|volume=159|pages=672–675}}</ref> Over 20,000 cases of the alcoholic withdrawal state have been successfully treated with psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) in South Africa and Finland. In 1992 it was officially approved for the treatment of addictive withdrawal states by the medical authorities in South Africa. Consequently, patients receiving it can claim a refund from their medical insurance. The gas therapy reduces the use of highly addictive sedative medications (like benzopdiazepines and barbiturates) by over 90%. The technique thus reduces the danger of secondary addiction to benzodiazepines, which can be a real problem amongst alcoholics who have been treated with these agents. <http://www.sabri.org.za/>

===Vitamins===
The prophylactic administration of [[thiamine]] intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate containing fluids or food.  Alcoholics are often deficient in various nutrients which can cause severe complications during alcohol withdrawal such as the development of [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome|Wernicke syndrome]]. The vitamins of most importance in alcohol withdrawal are [[thiamine]] and [[folic acid]]. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. Vitamins should always be administered before any glucose is administered otherwise Wernicke syndrome can be precipitated.<ref name="Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal"/>

===Prevention of brain damage===
Failure to manage the alcohol withdrawal syndrome appropriately can lead to permanent brain damage or death.<ref name="pmid19670554">{{cite journal |author=Hanwella R, de Silva V |title=Treatment of alcohol dependence |journal=Ceylon Med J |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=63–5 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19670554 }}</ref> It has been proposed that brain damage due to alcohol withdrawal may be prevented by the administration of [[NMDA antagonist]]s, [[calcium antagonist]]s, and [[glucocorticoid antagonist]]s.<ref name="Hunt-"/> The NMDA antagonist [[acamprosate]] reduces excessive glutamate rebound thereby suppressing excitotoxicity and potential withdrawal related neurotoxicity.<ref name="pmid15963001">{{cite journal |author=De Witte P, Littleton J, Parot P, Koob G |title=Neuroprotective and abstinence-promoting effects of acamprosate: elucidating the mechanism of action |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=517–37 |year=2005 |pmid=15963001 }}</ref>
A cheaper, non prescription substance would be dextromethorphan, with is metabolized into dextrothrophan, which has calcium channel and NMDA blocking effects. Any NMDA antagonist is likely to be of benefit in alcohol withdrawal, due to the upregulated nature of ligand gated calcium channels due to the downregulated GABAA Cl- channel.

===Substances impairing recovery===
Continued use of benzodiazepines may impair recovery from psychomotor and cognitive impairments from alcohol.<ref name="Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide"/> Cigarette smoking may slow down or interfere with recovery of brain pathways in recovering alcoholics.<ref name="Neurobiological and neurocognitive effects of chronic cigarette smoking and alcoholism"/>
