'''Zyklon B''' ({{IPA-de|tsykloːn ˈbeː}}; also spelled '''Cyclon B''' or '''Cyclone B''') was the [[trade name]] of a [[cyanide]]-based [[pesticide]] invented in the early 1920s and infamous for its later use by [[Nazi Germany]] to kill human beings in [[gas chamber]]s of [[extermination camp]]s during [[the Holocaust]]. Zyklon B consisted of [[hydrogen cyanide]] (prussic acid), a [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], a warning [[odorant]] ([[ethyl bromoacetate]]),<ref group="Note">The Zyklon B used for mass killings of humans regularly omitted the warning odorant.</ref> and one of several [[adsorbent]]s.

[[Zyklon A]] was a previously produced liquid [[pesticide]], which released [[hydrogen cyanide]] in a chemical reaction with water. After the invention of Zyklon B, its production was stopped.

One of the co-inventors of Zyklon B, the chemist and businessman [[Bruno Tesch]], was executed by the British in 1946 for his role in the Holocaust.

==History==
[[File:Zyklon B labels.jpg|thumb|Zyklon B labels]]
Even before any of the modern methods of mass-producing [[prussic acid]] were developed, suggestions were made that it could be used systematically to kill humans. A Berlin pharmacist is credited with the proposal to use rags with prussic acid placed on [[bayonet]]s to combat the advancing Napoleonic army in 1813.<ref>[http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters16.gif Blausaeure zur Schaedlingsbekaempfung: Prussic Acid in Pest Control]. Holocaust-history.org (1998-01-23). Retrieved on 2011-04-19.</ref> During [[World War I]], the French army reportedly – according to [[Fritz Haber]], the German chemist who helped develop poisonous gas for German Army use (see below) – used 2000 tons of prussic acid as a [[Chemical warfare|poison gas agent]] in [[artillery]] [[ammunition]].<ref>Peters, [http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters17.gif ''Blausäure zur Schadlingsbekampfungen''] (Stuggart, 1933), p. 17 citing in footnote 84 [[Fritz Haber]], "Zur Geschichte des Gaskriegs" in "5 Vortraege", Berlin, p. 81, note 3</ref>

Hydrocyanic acid was widely used for the [[fumigation]] of valuable tree crops. It was initially applied to [[citrus fruit]] in 1887 in [[California]].<ref>[http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-rasch-1941/htm/p133.htm The Efficiency of Prussic Acid Fumigation at Low Temperatures]. Holocaust-history.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-19.</ref> Use spread to [[Spain]] and other countries using either liquid prussic acid, [[calcium cyanide]], or [[sodium cyanide]] preparations. During [[World War I]] other HCN-based pest control applications were developed, and soon fumigation of ships, stores, factories, and even residential buildings with hydrocyanic acid gas became a popular method of combatting [[insect]] and [[rodent]] pests in many countries.<ref>Peters [http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters32.gif] cites a 1932 [[USDA]] bulletin where it is recommended even for careful private use</ref> Thousands of ships, cereal mills, and other food processing factories were fumigated with hydrocyanic acid gas until the mid-1930s in Germany alone.

[[Evonik Industries|Degussa]] ("Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt") had a leading role in the German research on pest control with hydrocyanic acid gas from 1916/17 on.<ref>[http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters42.gif Blausaeure zur Schaedlingsbekaempfung: Prussic Acid in Pest Control]. Holocaust-history.org (1998-01-23). Retrieved on 2011-04-19.</ref> Degussa's expertise in handling HCN resulted from its use in the extraction of gold from gold ore. Initially, the so-called ''pot method'' was used to generate HCN gas by treating [[sodium cyanide]] or [[potassium cyanide]] with diluted [[sulfuric acid]] in a pot.<ref>[http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters45.gif Blausaeure zur Schaedlingsbekaempfung: Prussic Acid in Pest Control]. Holocaust-history.org (1998-01-23). Retrieved on 2011-04-19.</ref> Like the utilisation of highly concentrated liquid prussic acid, the pot method has disadvantages. For example, prussic acid is chemically stable only for a limited period of time. Highly explosive air-HCN mixtures form easily when applied.

In March 1919, ''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH'' ([[Degesch]], lit. "German Limited Company for Pest Control") was founded by a consortium of German chemical companies including Degussa, and initially led by [[chemistry]] [[Nobel laureate]] [[Fritz Haber]]. Haber had World War I experience in the development of [[poison gas]] for the German [[chemical warfare]] program. At Degesch, [[Ferdinand Flury]] developed ''[[Zyklon A]]'' in 1920. Its development was a major advance over previous methods of delivering hydrocyanic acid for pest control because of its improved chemical stability and the presence of a warning odorant.<ref>[http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters57.gif Blausaeure zur Schaedlingsbekaempfung: Prussic Acid in Pest Control].

[[Walter Heerdt]], [[Bruno Tesch (chemist)|Bruno Tesch]] and [[Gerhard Peters]] were all collaborators of [[Fritz Haber]] working at the [[Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] at [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]]. Out of this group of Haber assistants, Walter Heerdt was named the official inventor of Zyklon B in a [[Degesch]] patent application from 20 June 1922 (number DE 438818). [[Reichspatentamt]] awarded the patent on 27 December 1926.<ref>

</ref> The main invention in Zyklon B consisted of the absorption of liquid hydrocyanic acid into a highly porous adsorbent. Initially, heated [[diatomite]] ([[diatomaceous earth]]) was used as an adsorbent. Later, high-porosity [[gypsum]] [[Pelletizing|pellets]] called ''Erco''-dice (described by eye witnesses as "crystals") as well as disks made from [[wood fibre]] were also used. The adsorbed hydrocyanic acid was very safe in handling and storage when placed in inexpensive airtight cans of various sizes.<ref>Peters [http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/peters-1933/gif/peters59.gif] and following pages</ref> Gerhard Peters, manager of Degesch, cites M. Kaiser to the effect that <blockquote>Heute ist die Zyklon-Blausäure als "das Mittel der Wahl" [...] nicht nur zur Entwanzung und Entlausung, sondern ganz allgemein zur Entwesung großer Räume in allen Erdteilen bekannt. ("Today Zyklon-prussic-acid is known on all continents as the ''means of choice'' [...] not only for debugging and delousing but also, in general, for disinfesting large rooms.)</blockquote>

From 1929 onwards the United States used Zyklon B to [[disinfect]] the freight trains and clothes of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] immigrants entering the U.S.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?storyID=7083| title=How America inspired the Third Reich.| first=Paul| last=Spike| publisher=The First Post| date=2007-05-31| accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> Farm Securities Administration photographer Marion Post Wolcott recorded the use of cyanide gas and Zyklon B by the Public Health Service at the New Orleans Quarantine Station during the 1930s.<ref>Photographs are retained in the National Library of Medicine.

In early 1942, Zyklon B had emerged as the preferred extermination tool of the Nazi regime for both the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] and [[Majdanek]] [[extermination camp]]s during the [[Holocaust]]. The chemical claimed the lives of roughly 1.2 million people in these camps. [[Rudolf Höss]], commandant of Auschwitz, said that the use of Zyklon-B came about on the initiative of  one of his subordinates, [[Karl Fritzsch|Captain Karl Fritzsch]], who used the substance to kill some Russian [[POW]]s in late August 1941. The experiment was repeated on more Russian [[POW]]s, with Höss watching, in September.<ref>Höss, ''Death Dealer'', pp. 155–56, cited in Christopher Browning, ''The Origins of the Final Solution'' (Nebraska Univ Press/Yad Vashem, 2004), pp. 526–27, n. 208, 209, 210.</ref> The emergence of Zyklon-B as the preferred chemical was a multistranded process.<ref>Christopher Browning, ''Origins of the Final Solution'', (Lincoln, NB/Jerusalem: Univ of Nebraska Press/Yad Vashem, 2004), pp. 356–58.</ref>

==Production and marketing==
[[File:Lethal gas crystal can & documents.jpg|thumb|upright|A can of Zyklon B with adsorbent granules and original signed documents detailing ordering of Zyklon B as "materials for Jewish resettlement" (display at KL Auschwitz I museum)]]

Degesch played a key role in the development (see above) and manufacturing of Zyklon B. Many German companies had stock in Degesch, but all eventually sold their shares to the chemical giant Degussa (now part of Evonik Industries) in the early 1920s.

Degesch's role at this point was limited to acquiring [[patent]]s and [[intellectual property]]: it did not produce Zyklon B. The manufacture of Zyklon B was handled by ''Dessauer Werke für Zucker and Chemische Werke'', which acquired the stabilizer from IG Farben, the warning agent from [[Schering]] AG and the [[prussic acid]] from ''Dessauer Schlempe'' and assembled them into the final product. ''Dessauer Schlempe'' extracted prussic acid from the waste products of the [[sugar beet]] refining process. Apart from Dessauer Werke, Zyklon B was also produced from 1935 by ''Kaliwerke AG'' in the Czech town of [[Kolín]]<ref>[http://www.zyklon-b.info/firmen/kollin.htm Kaliwerke Kolin]</ref><ref>Miloš Hořejš, Ivana Lorencová (eds.): Věda a technika v českých zemích v období 2. světové války, p. 326</ref> and in France.<ref>[http://www.zyklon-b.info/firmen/frankreich.htm SOFUMI]</ref><ref>[http://www.liberation.fr/france/0109208830-zyklon-b-la-france-n-a-pas-fourni-les-camps-le-groupe-francais-ugine-a-bien-fabrique-l-insecticide-mais-il-n-approvisionnait-pas-les-ss Zyklon B: la France n'a pas fourni les camps. Le groupe français Ugine a bien fabriqué l'insecticide,mais il n'approvisionnait pas les SS]</ref>

Upon production, Zyklon B was sold by Degesch to Degussa. To cut costs, Degussa sold the marketing rights of Zyklon B to two intermediaries: the Heerdt and Linger GmbH (Heli) and [[Tesch & Stabenow]] (Tesch und Stabenow, Internationale Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung m.b.H., or Testa) of [[Hamburg]]. Both suppliers split their territory along the [[Elbe]] river, with Heli handling the clients to the west and Testa those to the east.<ref>{{cite book |last= Christainson |first= Scott |title= The Last Gasp: The Rise and Fall of the American Gas Chamber |publisher= [[University of California Press]] |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-520-25562-3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AIzaoHoggUwC |page=166}}</ref>

Zyklon B is still in production in the [[Czech Republic]] in the factory Draslovka Kolín a.s. in the city of [[Kolín]], under the [[tradename]] ''Uragan D2'', and is sold for the purpose of eradicating insects and small animals. The Czech word ''uragan'' means "hurricane" or "cyclone" in English.<ref>[http://www.draslovka.cz/CMSPage.jsp?id=212e4f52-8fc5-47dd-83e3-c77863814001&context=79844cbe-01d9-49fd-9bb4-dc5ea0aa6453.6582a8ab-123c-4ba7-b341-6c0cfe628dc6.da0ed5d9-0d7b-47d6-99de-d0c5ea68b04b.212e4f52-8fc5-47dd-83e3-c77863814001&ditemid=8de9774a-b584-4078-953c-4fc2af39fcbb&dblockid=b17d7b3c-b24c-4302-9a87-cd2de4268057 Product page]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adezin.cz%2F%3Fl%3Dcz%26i%3D8&sl=cs&tl=en&hl=en&ie=UTF-8 |title= Google Translation of the Adezin s.r.o. Product Information Page|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

In addition to the production of Zyklon B without the warning odorant specifically for the purpose of mass killings of humans, it has been suggested that some Zyklon B may have lacked the odorant because of supply shortages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/pressac/technique-and-operation/pressac0017.shtml |title=Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers |publisher=Holocaust-history.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref>

[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumb|Interior of Majdanek gas chamber, showing [[Prussian blue]] residue]]

Zyklon B was used by [[Nazi Germany]] to poison prisoners in the [[gas chamber]]s of the [[extermination camp]]s [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz Birkenau]], and [[Majdanek]], and in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Most of the victims were [[Jew]]s and [[Poles]] and the Zyklon B gas became a central agent of [[the Holocaust]]. The chemical used in the gas chambers was deliberately made without the warning odorant.<ref>Van Husen, William H. "Zyklon B". ''World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia''. 1999.</ref><ref>[http://www1.jur.uva.nl/junsv/Excerpts/415inhalt.htm LG Frankfurt am Main vom 27.5.1955, 4a Ks 1/55]. "Gerstein habe dann gefragt, ob Zyklon ohne Reizstoff geliefert werden könne, und habe, als er die ablehnende Haltung des Angeklagten bemerkte, erklärt, dass es sich um 'legale Hinrichtungen', in einzelnen Fällen um Sterbehilfe handle. [...] Man habe sich dann auf die Lieferung von monatlich 200 kg geeinigt."</ref>

On September 3, 1941, about 600 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and 250 sick Polish P.O.W.s were gassed to death with Zyklon B in Auschwitz Camp I.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 |title=Gassing Operations |publisher=Ushmm.org |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> This massacre came shortly after the first experiment with gas, in which about 25 Soviet prisoners were gassed to death in the basement of [[Block 11]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org/m/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=442&Itemid=8 |title=Auschwitz-Birkenau - 64 Years Ago: First Nazi Use of Poison Gas for Murdering People in Auschwitz |publisher=En.auschwitz.org |date=2005-08-30 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> The experiments lasted longer than 20 hours.

According to [[Rudolf Höss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, Bunker 1 held 800 victims, and Bunker 2 held 1,200 victims.<ref name=Piper162>[[Franciszek Piper|Piper, Franciszek]]. "Gas chambers and Crematoria", in Berenbaum, Michael & Gutman, Yisrael (eds). ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 1994, p. 162.</ref> Once the gas chambers were full, their doors were closed tightly, and solid pellets of Zyklon B were dropped into the chambers through pipes in the side walls, thus releasing the cyanide gas when the Zyklon B got wet. Those victims inside the gas chambers usually died within 20 minutes. The speed of the deaths depended on how close the victim was standing to a [[poison gas]] vent, according to Höss, who estimated that about one third of the victims died practically immediately.<ref>[http://www.spectacle.org/695/zyklonb.html Auschwitz: Zyklon B]</ref><ref name=Piper170>[[Franciszek Piper|Piper, Franciszek]]. "Gas chambers and Crematoria", p. 170.</ref> [[Johann Kremer]], an [[SS]] doctor who oversaw the gassings, testified: the "Shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives."<ref name=Piper163>[[Franciszek Piper|Piper, Franciszek]]. "Gas chambers and Crematoria", p. 163.</ref> If the gas chamber had been crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears.<ref name=Piper170/>

Victor Capesius was one of the Nazi [[war criminal]]s who worked with Zyklon B in Auschwitz and Birkenau. He was sentenced to prison in West Germany for his crimes.<ref>http://archive.jta.org/article/1968/01/25/2944304/Nazi-convicted-of-Auschwitz-murders-released-after-three-years-of-prison</ref>

===Legacy after World War II mass murders===
After [[World War II]] ended in 1945, the two directors of the [[Tesch & Stabenow|Testa company]], [[Bruno Tesch (chemist)|Bruno Tesch]] and Karl Weinbacher, were tried in a British military court, were convicted of mass murder, and were executed for their part in producing and distributing the Zyklon B.

The continued use of the trade name ''Zyklon'' (the German word for "cyclone") continues to prompt angry reactions from Jewish groups. In 2002, both the [[Siemens]] and [[Umbro]] companies withdrew their attempts to use or trademark the word for their products.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2233890.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Siemens retreats over Nazi name | date=2002-09-05 | accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2222783.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Fury over Nazi gas sports shoe name}}</ref>

[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] claim that Zyklon B gas was not used in the [[gas chamber]]s, relying for evidence on the low levels of residues of [[Prussian blue]] in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings found by [[Fred A. Leuchter]], which Leuchter ascribed to the general [[louse|delousing]] of the buildings. Leuchter's "[[negative control]]", a sample of [[gasket]] material taken from a different building in the camp, registered as having no such cyanide residue. <ref>''[http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/auschwitz/ftp.py?camps/auschwitz//cyanide/cyanide.002 Shofar FTP Archive File: cyanide.002]'' [[The Nizkor Project]]</ref> 

The manager of the [[analytical chemistry|chemical laboratory]] hired by Leuchter stated in an interview in the movie ''[[Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.]]'', that Leuchter's thick samples of brick would have diluted completely the cyanide residue, which formed only a very fine layer on the masonry walls and cannot penetrate deeper.

In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in [[Kraków]] re-examined this claim on the grounds that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction.<ref>''Amoklauf gegen die Wirklichkeit''. Praca zbiorowa; B. Gallanda, J. Bailer, F. Freund, T. Geisler, W. Lasek, N. Neugebauer, G. Spenn, W. Wegner; Bundesministerium fuer Unterricht und Kultur Wien, 1991.</ref> Using more sophisticated microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers, delousing chambers (as [[positive control]]s), and living quarters (as negative controls), finding cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the ruins of the gas chambers but none in the ruins of the living quarters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/iffr/report.shtml |title=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz and Birkenau Concentration Camps |date=2000-01-15 |publisher=The Institute for Forensic Research, Cracow |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Zyklon B is a cyanide-based poisonous gas that interferes with [[cellular respiration]]. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by binding to one of the [[protein]]s involved in the [[electron transport chain]].<ref name=Lehniger>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=David L.|last2=Cox|first2=Michael M.|title=Lehniger Principles of Biochemistry|publisher=[[Worth Publishers]]|year=2000|location=New York|edition=3rd|isbn=1-57259-153-6|pages=668,670–71,676}}</ref>  This protein, [[cytochrome c oxidase]], contains [[Main subunit of cytochrome c oxidase|several subunits]] and has [[ligand]]s containing iron groups.  At one of these iron groups, [[heme]] a3, the cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand [[pi bond]]ing.  As a result of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons which would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so.  Instead, because of the new bond formed between the iron and the cyanide, these electrons destabilize the compound (based on [[molecular orbital theory]]); thus, the heme group no longer accepts them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and the cell can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP.<ref name=Lehniger/>
