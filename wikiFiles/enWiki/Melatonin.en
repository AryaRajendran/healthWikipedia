In mammals, melatonin is biosynthesized in four enzymatic steps from the essential dietary amino acid [[tryptophan]], with [[serotonin]] produced at the second step. Melatonin is secreted into the blood by the [[pineal gland]] in the brain.  Known as the "hormone of darkness," it is secreted in darkness in both day-active ([[Diurnality|diurnal]]) and night-active ([[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]) animals.<ref name="Challet2007" /> It may also be produced by a variety of peripheral cells such as [[Bone marrow|bone marrow cells]],<ref name="Pp">{{cite journal | author = Maestroni GJ | title = The immunotherapeutic potential of melatonin | journal = Expert Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 467–76 | year = 2001 | month = March | pmid = 11227046 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.10.3.467 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Conti A, Conconi S, Hertens E, Skwarlo-Sonta K, Markowska M, Maestroni JM | title = Evidence for melatonin synthesis in mouse and human bone marrow cells | journal = J.

Usually, the melatonin concentration in these cells is much higher than that found in the blood, but it does not seem to be regulated by the photoperiod.

Melatonin, produced in the [[pineal gland]] which is outside of the [[blood–brain barrier]], acts as an [[endocrine]] hormone since it is released into the [[blood]].<ref name="pmid19075654">{{cite journal | author = Kaur C, Ling EA | title = Antioxidants and neuroprotection in the adult and developing central nervous system | journal = Curr.

Melatonin can suppress [[libido]] by inhibiting secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) from the [[anterior pituitary]] gland, especially in mammals that have a [[Reproduction|breeding]] season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|long-day breeders]] is [[Estrous cycle#Anestrus|repressed by melatonin]] and the reproduction of [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|short-day breeders]] is stimulated by melatonin.  During the night, melatonin regulates [[leptin]], lowering its levels.

Light/dark information reaches the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus|suprachiasmatic nuclei]] (SCN) from retinal [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s, which are intrinsically photosensitive [[photoreceptor cell]]s that are distinct from those involved in the primary (at least, from one point of view) image formation function of the eye (that is the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] of the retina).

[[Melanopsin]], often confused with melatonin because of its similar name, is structurally unrelated to the hormone.

Production of melatonin by the pineal gland is inhibited by [[light]] to the [[retina]] and permitted by [[darkness]]. Its onset each evening is called the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).

Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.<ref name="Pohanka_2011" />{{rp|p.189}}<ref name="Tan2000">{{cite journal | author = Tan DX, Manchester LC, Reiter RJ, Qi WB, Karbownik M, Calvo JR | title = Significance of melatonin in antioxidative defense system: reactions and products | journal = Biol Signals Recept | volume = 9 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 137–59 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10899700 | doi = 10.1159/000014635 }}</ref>

Recent research indicates that the first metabolite of melatonin in the melatonin antioxidant pathway may be N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (or AFMK) rather than the common, excreted 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate. AFMK alone is detectable in unicellular organisms and [[metazoans]]. A single AFMK molecule can neutralize up to 10 [[ROS/RNS]] (reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species) because many of the products of the reaction/derivatives (including melatonin) are themselves antioxidants. This capacity to absorb free radicals extends at least to the quaternary metabolites of melatonin, a process referred to as "the free-radical scavenging cascade". This is not true of other, conventional antioxidants.<ref name="Tan_Manchester"/>

===Aging===
Research has supported the anti-aging properties of melatonin. Younger children hit their peak melatonin production at night, and some researchers believe that the level of melatonin peaks earlier as people get older. This may explain why older adults go to bed earlier, wake up earlier, and have more sleep problems than children do.<ref>University of Maryland Medical Center. "Melatonin." 2011. http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/melatonin-000315.htm</ref>

Some studies have shown that melatonin plays a crucial part in the aging process and that it may act as an anti-aging agent when administered to older mice. It has been reported in one study that administration of melatonin in elderly mice may reverse this change in expression of some 13 genes, thus making them similar to those of younger mice.<ref name="pmid15009506">{{cite journal | author = Sharman EH, Sharman KG, Ge YW, Lahiri DK, Bondy SC | title = Age-related changes in murine CNS mRNA gene expression are modulated by dietary melatonin | journal = J.

While the packaging of melatonin often warns against use in children, at least one long-term study does assess effectiveness and safety in children.  No serious safety concerns were noted in any of the 94 cases studied by means of a structured questionnaire for the parents.

Melatonin was used to treat [[periodic limb movement disorder]], a common neurological condition, which, when severe, adversely affects sleep and causes excessive daytime fatigue, in a small trial conducted by Kunz D and Bes F.  In this condition, the sufferer is affected by mini arousals during sleep and limb movements that occur in a frequent rhythmic fashion.  This often involves leg kicking, but sometimes also involves arm movement.  Those affected are often not aware of the condition, and partners are often the first to notice the condition. 7 out of the 9 participants in the trial showed significant improvement.<ref name="pmid11247054">{{cite journal | author = Kunz D, Bes F | title = Exogenous melatonin in periodic limb movement disorder: an open clinical trial and a hypothesis | journal = Sleep | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–7 | year = 2001 | month = March | pmid = 11247054 | doi = }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Melatonin appears to cause very few [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] in the short term, up to three months, when healthy people take it at low doses. A systematic review<ref name="Buscemi2006" /> in 2006 looked specifically at efficacy and safety in two categories of melatonin usage: first, for sleep disturbances that are secondary to other diagnoses and, second, for sleep disorders such as [[jet lag]] and [[shift work]] that accompany sleep restriction.<ref name="Buscemi2006" />

The study concluded that ''There is no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. There is evidence that melatonin is safe with short term use''.<ref name="Buscemi2006" />

==Availability==
Legal availability of melatonin varies in different countries, ranging from being available without prescription (e.g. in most of [[North America]]) to being available only on prescription or not at all (although its possession and use may not be illegal). In the UK it is available on prescription only.

The hormone may be administered orally, as capsules, tablets or liquid, sublingually, or as transdermal patches.

The use of melatonin derived from animal pineal tissue may carry the risk of contamination or the means of transmitting viral material. The synthetic form of this medication does not carry this risk.<ref name= "Altun2007"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/melatonin.html |title=Melatonin| publisher=[[Drugs.com]]| accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>

===Dietary supplement===

In the USA, because it is sold as a dietary supplement, sometimes combined with other ingredients, such as vitamins and herbal extracts, and not as a drug, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations that apply to medications are not applicable to melatonin.<ref name="Altun2007"/> However, new FDA rules required that by June 2010 all production of dietary supplements must comply with "current [[good manufacturing practice]]s" (cGMP), and be manufactured with "controls that result in a consistent product free of contamination, with accurate labeling."<ref>{{cite press release | title = FDA Issues Dietary Supplements Final Rule | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108938.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-04}}</ref> In addition, the industry has been required to report to the FDA "all serious dietary supplement related adverse events" and the FDA has, within the cGMP guidelines, begun enforcement of that requirement.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Food products===

The FDA is considering whether these food products can continue to be sold with the label "dietary supplements". On January 13, 2010, they issued a warning letter to Innovative Beverage, creators of several beverages marketed as "relaxation drinks," stating that melatonin is not approved as a [[food additive]] because it is not [[generally recognized as safe]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Reynaldo R.

===Prolonged release===

[[File:Circadin 2mg.jpg|thumb|Circadin 2mg, prolonged-release melatonin]]
Melatonin is available as a prolonged-release prescription drug, trade-name Circadin, manufactured by Neurim Pharmaceuticals. The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has approved Circadin 2&nbsp;mg (prolonged-release melatonin) for patients aged 55 or over, as monotherapy for the short-term treatment (up to 13 weeks) of primary insomnia characterized by poor quality of sleep.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/69195.php Medical News Today] Circadin (Prolonged-Release Melatonin) For Primary Insomnia Recommended For Approval In The EU (27 Apr 2007)</ref>

==History==

Melatonin is related to the mechanism by which some [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] change the color of their skin and, indeed, it was in this connection the substance first was discovered.<ref name="Filadelfi1996">{{cite journal | author = Filadelfi AM, Castrucci AM | title = Comparative aspects of the pineal/melatonin system of poikilothermic vertebrates | journal = J.
