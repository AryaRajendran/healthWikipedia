==Detection of noxious stimuli==

Mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli are detected by nerve endings called [[nociceptors]], which are found in the [[skin]] and on internal surfaces such as the [[periosteum]] or [[joint]] surfaces. The concentration of nociceptors varies throughout the body; they are found in greater numbers in the skin than in deep internal surfaces.
All [[nociceptors]] are [[free nerve ending]]s that have their cell bodies outside the [[spinal column]] in the [[dorsal root ganglion|dorsal root ganglia]] and are named according to their appearance at their sensory ends.

Nociceptors have a certain threshold; that is, they require a minimum intensity of stimulation before they trigger a signal.  Once this threshold is reached a signal is passed along the axon of the neuron into the [[spinal cord]].  

In some conditions, excitation of pain fibers becomes greater as the pain stimulus continues, leading to a condition called [[hyperalgesia]].

==Transmission through central nervous system==
===Spinothalamic tract===
Before reaching the brain, the spinothalamic tract splits into the lateral, "neospinothalamic" tract and the medial, "paleospinothalamic" tract.<ref name=Skevington1995>{{cite book |last=Skevington |first=S. M. |year=1995 |title=Psychology of pain |location=Chichester, UK |publisher=Wiley |page=18 |isbn=0-471-95771-2 }}</ref>

====Neospinothalamic tract==== <!--Neospinothalamic tract redirects here-->
Fast pain travels via type [[A delta fiber|Aδ fiber]]s to terminate in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] of the spinal cord where they [[synapse]] on [[dendrite]]s of the neospinothalamic tract. The [[axon]]s of these neurons cross the midline ([[decussation|decussate]]) through the [[anterior white commissure]] and ascend contralaterally along the [[anterolateral columns]]. These fibres terminate on the [[ventrobasal complex]] of the thalamus and synapse with the dendrites of the [[Postcentral gyrus|somatosensory cortex]]. Fast pain is felt within a tenth of a second of application of the pain stimulus and is a sharp, acute, prickling pain felt in response to mechanical and thermal stimulation. It can be localised easily if Aδ fibres are stimulated together with tactile receptors. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

====Paleospinothalamic tract==== <!--Paleospinothalamic tract redirects here-->
Slow pain is transmitted via slower type [[Group C nerve fiber|C fiber]]s to laminae II and III of the dorsal horns, together known as the [[Substantia gelatinosa of Rolando|substantia gelatinosa]]. Impulses are then transmitted to nerve fibers that terminate in lamina V, also in the dorsal horn, synapsing with neurons that join fibers from the fast pathway, crossing to the opposite side via the anterior white commissure, and traveling upwards through the anterolateral pathway. These neurons terminate throughout the [[brain stem]], with one tenth of fibres stopping in the [[thalamus]] and the rest stopping in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], [[pons]] and [[periaqueductal grey]] of the [[midbrain tectum]]. Slow pain is stimulated by chemical stimulation, is poorly localized and is described as an aching, throbbing or burning pain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Zqzzi81MgKQJ:joson.rey.tripod.com/skinsofttissues/painpathway.rtf+slow+pain+Paleospinothalamic+aching,+throbbing+or+burning+pain&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=Pain Pathway |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-24}}</ref>

==Regulation==
The body possesses an endogenous analgesia system, which can be supplemented with [[analgesic|analgesic drugs]] to regulate nociception and pain. There is both an analgesia system in the central nervous system and peripheral receptors that decreases the grade in which nociception reaches the higher brain areas. The degree of pain can be modified by the [[periaqueductal gray]] before it reaches the thalamus and consciousness. According to [[Pain#Gate_control|gate control theory of pain]], this area can also reduce pain when non-painful stimuli are received in conjunction with nociception.

===Central===
The central analgesia system is mediated by 3 major components: the [[periaqueductal grey matter]], the [[nucleus raphe magnus]] and the nociception inhibitory neurons within the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]]s of the spinal cord, which act to inhibit nociception-transmitting neurons also located in the spinal dorsal horn.

===Peripheral===
The peripheral regulation consists of several different types of [[opioid receptor]]s that are activated in response to the binding of the body's [[endorphin]]s. These receptors, which exist in a variety of areas in the body, inhibit firing of neurons that would otherwise be stimulated to do so by nociceptors.

===Factors===
{{main|Pain#Theory}}
The [[Pain#Theory|gate control theory of pain]], proposed by [[Patrick David Wall]] and [[Ronald Melzack]], postulates that nociception (pain) is "gated" by non-nociception stimuli such as vibration. Thus, rubbing a bumped knee seems to relieve pain by preventing its transmission to the brain. Pain is also "gated" by signals that descend from the brain to the spinal cord to suppress (and in other cases enhance) incoming nociception (pain) information.

==Nociception response==

When nociceptors are stimulated they transmit signals through sensory neurons in the spinal cord. These neurons release the excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]] at their [[synapse]]s. 

If the signals are sent to the [[reticular formation]] and [[thalamus]], the sensation of pain enters [[consciousness]] in a dull poorly localized manner. From the thalamus, the signal can travel to the [[somatosensory cortex]] in the [[telencephalon|cerebrum]], when the pain is experienced as localized and having more specific qualities.

Nociception can also cause generalized [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic responses]] before or without reaching consciousness to cause [[pallor]], [[diaphoresis]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], [[lightheadedness]], [[nausea]] and [[fainting]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3987/is_200603/ai_n16117205/pg_1 |last=Feinstein |first=B. |first2=J. |last2=Langton |first3=R. |last3=Jameson |first4=F. |last4=Schiller |title=Experiments on pain referred from deep somatic tissues |journal=J Bone Joint Surg |year=1954 |volume=36-A |issue=5 |pages=981–97 |accessdate=2007-01-06 |pmid=13211692 }}</ref>

The term "nociception" was coined by [[Charles Scott Sherrington]] to distinguish the physiological process (nervous activity) from pain (a subjective experience).<ref>{{cite book |last=Sherrington |first=C. |title=The Integrative Action of the Nervous System |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1906 }}</ref>
