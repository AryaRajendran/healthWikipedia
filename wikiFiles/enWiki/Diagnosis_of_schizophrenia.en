The '''diagnosis of schizophrenia''' is based on criteria in either the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', version DSM-IV-TR, or the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], the ICD-10.<ref name=Lancet09>{{vcite journal |author=[[Jim van Os|van Os J]], Kapur S |title=Schizophrenia |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9690 |pages=635–45 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19700006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8}}</ref> These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a [[mental health professional]]. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity before a diagnosis is made.<ref name=BMJ07>{{vcite journal |author=Picchioni MM, Murray RM |title=Schizophrenia |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7610 |pages=91–5 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17626963 |pmc=1914490 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39227.616447.BE}}</ref> As of 2009 there is no objective test.<ref name=Lancet09/>

==Criteria==
The ICD-10 criteria are typically used in European countries, while the DSM-IV-TR criteria are used in the United States and the rest of the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian [[Kurt Schneider#First rank symptoms|first-rank symptoms]]. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high.<ref name="Jakobsen_et_al_2005">{{vcite journal |author=Jakobsen KD, Frederiksen JN, Hansen T, ''et al.'' |year=2005 |title=Reliability of clinical ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses |journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 | issue=3 |pages=209–12 |pmid=16195122 | doi = 10.1080/08039480510027698}}</ref>

According to the revised fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM-IV-TR), to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, three diagnostic criteria must be met:<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" />
# Characteristic symptoms: Two or more of the following, each present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).
#* [[Delusion]]s
#* [[Hallucination]]s
#* Disorganized speech, which is a manifestation of [[thought disorder|formal thought disorder]]
#* Grossly disorganized behavior (e.g. dressing inappropriately, crying frequently) or [[Catatonia|catatonic]] behavior
#* Negative symptoms: [[Blunted affect]] (lack or decline in emotional response), [[alogia]] (lack or decline in speech), or [[avolition]] (lack or decline in motivation)
#:If the delusions are judged to be bizarre, or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the patient's actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other, only that symptom is required above. The speech disorganization criterion is only met if it is severe enough to substantially impair communication.
# Social or occupational dysfunction: For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset.
# Significant duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).

If signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of [[schizophreniform disorder]] is applied.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">{{vcite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |chapter=Schizophrenia |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/schiz.htm |isbn=0-89042-024-6 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as [[brief psychotic disorder]], and various conditions may be classed as [[psychotic disorder not otherwise specified]]. Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of [[mood disorder]] are substantially present (although [[schizoaffective disorder]] could be diagnosed), or if symptoms of [[pervasive developmental disorder]] are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present, or if the symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, such as abuse of a drug or medication.

==Subtypes==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] contains five sub-classifications of schizophrenia, although the developers of [[DSM-5]] are recommending they be dropped from the new classification:<ref>[[American Psychiatric Association]] DSM-5 Work Groups (2010) [http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/SchizophreniaandOtherPsychoticDisorders.aspx Proposed Revisions – Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders]. Retrieved 17 February 2010.</ref><ref name=WHOICD/>
* [[Paranoid schizophrenia|Paranoid type]]: Where delusions and hallucinations are present but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, and affective flattening are absent. (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0)
* [[Disorganized schizophrenia|Disorganized type]]: Named ''hebephrenic schizophrenia'' in the ICD. Where thought disorder and [[Blunted affect|flat affect]] are present together. (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1)
* [[Catatonia|Catatonic type]]: The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and [[waxy flexibility]]. (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2)
* Undifferentiated type: Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met. (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3)
* Residual type: Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only. (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5)

The [[ICD|ICD-10]] defines two additional subtypes:<ref name=WHOICD>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders |format=pdf |work=World Health Organization |page=26}}</ref>
* Post-schizophrenic depression: A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low-level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present. (ICD code F20.4)
* Simple schizophrenia: Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes. (ICD code F20.6)

Psychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders, including [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Pope HG |year=1983 |title=Distinguishing bipolar disorder from schizophrenia in clinical practice: guidelines and case reports |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=34 |pages=322–28 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/34/4/322.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate= 2008-02-24}}</ref> [[borderline personality disorder]],<ref>{{vcite journal |author=McGlashan TH |title=Testing DSM-III symptom criteria for schizotypal and borderline personality disorders |journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |year=1987 |month=February |pmid=3813809}}</ref> drug intoxication and [[Substance-induced psychosis|drug-induced psychosis]]. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in [[delusional disorder]], and social withdrawal in [[social anxiety disorder]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder]]. Schizophrenia is complicated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by pure chance, although it can be difficult to distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bottas A |title=Comorbidity: Schizophrenia With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=April 15, 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1402540 }}</ref>

A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms,<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> such as [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]], [[systemic infection]], [[syphilis]], [[HIV]] infection, [[epilepsy]], and brain lesions. It may be necessary to rule out a [[delirium]], which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating [[level of consciousness]], and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication or possible [[adverse effects]] from [[antipsychotic medication]].

"Schizophrenia" does ''not'' mean [[dissociative identity disorder]]—formerly and still widely known as "multiple personalities"—despite the [[etymology]] of the word (Greek σχίζω = "I split").<ref name=BMJ07/>

===Early, late, and very late onset===
Early-onset schizophrenia refers to individuals who had their first episode of symptoms at age 20-30. Late-onset refers to those with their first episode of symptoms at age 40 – 64. Very late-onset refers to those with their first episode of symptoms at age 65 and older.<ref name="Howard">Howard, R., Rabins, P. V., Seeman, M. V., Jeste, D.

Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. However, individuals with late-onsets are more likely to report:<ref name="Howard" />
* Visual, tactile, and olfactory hallucinations
* Persecutory delusion
* Partition delusions
* Third-person, running commentary
* Accusatory or abusive auditory hallucinations

Late-onsets are less likely to have:<ref name="Howard" /><ref name="Wetherell" />
* Formal thought disorder
* Affective flattening or blunting
* Paranoia

Very late-onset are likely to have:<ref name="Howard" /><ref name="Wetherell" />
* Less formal thought disorder or cognitive impairment
* Less negative symptoms

==Controversies==
The scientific [[validity (statistics)|validity]] of schizophrenia, and its defining symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, have been criticized.<ref name="Boyle2002">{{vcite book |author=Boyle, Mary |title=Schizophrenia: a scientific delusion? |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-22718-6}}</ref><ref name="fn_8">{{vcite book |author=Bentall, Richard P.; Read, John E; Mosher, Loren R. |title=Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |location=Philadelphia |year=2004|isbn=1-58391-906-6}}</ref>

[[Nancy Andreasen]], a leading figure in schizophrenia research, has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic [[validity (statistics)|validity]] for the sake of artificially improving [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]].

The exclusion of affective components from the criteria for schizophrenia, despite their ubiquity in clinical settings, has also caused contention.
