'''''Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure''''' is a 2008 book by [[Paul Offit]], a vaccine expert and chief of infectious diseases at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]]. The book focuses on the [[vaccine controversy|controversy]] surrounding the now discredited link between [[vaccine]]s and [[autism]].

== Summary ==
Offit describes the origins and development of claims regarding the [[MMR vaccine]] and the vaccine preservative [[thiomersal]], as well as subsequent [[scientific evidence]] which has disproved a link with autism. The book discusses possible explanations for the persistence of these claims in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary, as well as the proliferation of potentially risky and unproven [[treatments for autism]].<ref name="nypost">{{cite news | work = [[New York Post]] | title = Autism's False Prophets: A Shot of Truth | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/09142008/postopinion/postopbooks/autisms_false_prophets_128960.htm | last = Goldberg | first = Robert | date = 2008-09-14 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}</ref> The author takes a critical view of several advocates of a vaccine–autism link, including [[Andrew Wakefield]], [[David Kirby (journalist)|David Kirby]], [[Mark Geier]], and [[Boyd Haley]], raising scientific and, in some cases, ethical and legal concerns. The book also explores divisions within the autism community on the topic of vaccines, as some parents consider the ongoing narrow focus on vaccines a distraction from more scientifically promising avenues of research. In this vein, Offit interviews [[Kathleen Seidel]], a mother of an autistic child who has published investigations critical of those who profit from promoting vaccine–autism claims.<ref name="salon"/>

Offit also touches on the heated and bitter debate surrounding vaccine claims. He describes receiving death threats, [[hate mail]], and threats against his children as a result of his advocacy for vaccine safety. Offit declined to do a book tour for ''Autism's False Prophets'', citing concerns about his physical safety and comparing the intensity of hatred and threats directed at him to that experienced by [[abortion]] providers.<ref name="newsweek">{{cite journal |journal= [[Newsweek]] | title = Stomping through a medical minefield | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/165644 | last = Kalb | first = Claudia | date = 2008-11-03 | accessdate = 2008-11-13 |volume=152 |issue=18 |pages=62–3 |pmid=18998447| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081119180127/http://www.newsweek.com/id/165644| archivedate= 19 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Author's [[royalties]] from the book are being donated to the Center for Autism Research at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].<ref name="royalties">{{cite press release| publisher =[[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Author-Royalties-From-Autism-Book/story.aspx?guid=%7BAF9CAF86-F7AE-49D4-A777-AFCCE0B25381%7D | title = Author Royalties From Autism Book Donated to Autism Research | date = 2008-11-03 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}</ref>

== Reception ==
The book was the nucleus of profiles of Offit in ''[[Newsweek]]''<ref name="newsweek"/> and ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.<ref name="inquirer">{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080917_Expert_sees_no_link_between_vaccines_and_autism.html |last=Avril|first=Tom |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2008-10-02 |work= [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |title= Expert sees no link between vaccines and autism| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080920003656/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080917_Expert_sees_no_link_between_vaccines_and_autism.html?| archivedate= 20 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' reviewed the book positively, concluding: "Although arguably the most courageous and most knowledgeable scientist about vaccines in the United States, Offit lives in fear for his life and that of his family."<ref name="nypost"/> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' also praised the book as "an invaluable chronicle that relates some of the many ways in which the vulnerabilities of anxious parents have been exploited."<ref name="wsj">{{cite news | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | last = Seebach | first = Linda | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122212979072465559.html | title = Charlatans to the Rescue | date = 2008-09-23 | accessdate = 2008-11-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081101044217/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122212979072465559.html?| archivedate= 1 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' wrote that the book "names names and calls nonsense nonsense", and provides "important insight into the fatal flaws of the key arguments of vaccine alarmists." The ''Inquirer'' applauded Offit's focus on slanted and sensationalist media coverage of the vaccine–autism issue, but faulted Offit for not holding scientists themselves sufficiently accountable for their failure to communicate the facts to the public.<ref name="pi-review">{{cite news | work = Philadelphia Inquirer | last = Collins | first = Huntly | url = http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/books/20080921_Defending_vaccines_in_the_autism_debate.html | title = Defending vaccines in the autism debate | date = 2008-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-11-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081002021332/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/books/20080921_Defending_vaccines_in_the_autism_debate.html| archivedate= 2 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' noted that the book "turned the tables" on those who see a pharmaceutical-industry conspiracy behind vaccination, by pointing out that the advocates of the autism–vaccine link receive large sums of money from lawyers and [[lobbyist]]s. The ''News'' applauded the book's deconstruction of "misinformation" from [[Don Imus]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], among others, but found Offit's "sarcasm and brow-beating of those he disagrees with" to be "grating".<ref name="rmn">{{cite news | work = [[Rocky Mountain News]] | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/autisms-false-prophets-bad-science-risky-and-the/ | title = Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure | last = Ruskin | first = Steve | date = 2008-10-02 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}</ref>

''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' reviewed the book as an "enlightening, highly readable, and ... timely" work which "deconstruct[s] the anti-vaccine movement as one driven by bad science, litigious greed, hype and ego."<ref name="salon">{{cite web | work = [[Salon.com|Salon]] |last = Parikh | first = Rahul | url = http://www.salon.com/books/review/2008/09/22/autism/index.html | title = Inside the vaccine-and-autism scare | date = 2008-09-22 | accessdate = 2008-11-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029001252/http://www.salon.com/books/review/2008/09/22/autism/index.html?| archivedate= 29 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> ''Salon'' faulted Offit for minimizing the work that autism advocacy groups have done to raise awareness, create support networks, and obtain research funding; the review noted that Offit focuses instead on aggressive and scientifically "slanted" groups like [[Defeat Autism Now!]] and [[Generation Rescue]]. The review concluded that the book "effectively pulls back the curtain on the anti-vaccine movement to reveal a crusade grounded less in fact and more in greed and opportunism".<ref name="salon"/>

''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' called the book "forceful" and "an easy-to-read medical thriller about the consequences of greed, hubris, and intellectual sloppiness."<ref name=Lord>{{cite journal |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2008-12-12 |volume=322 |issue=5908 |pages=1635–6 |title= Yes We Can! Choose Science in Autism |last=Lord |first=Catherine |doi=10.1126/science.1167173}}</ref> The review noted that Offit did not discuss the irrationality of human decision-making in the presence of relative risk and both anecdotal and empirical evidence, and mentioned that Offit did not carefully discuss the role of regression. In conclusion, the review observed that the book has emboldened the media to apply scientific principles, and called for using the book's momentum to shift resources from the autism–vaccination debate to research into causes and treatments.<ref name=Lord/>

The ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'' said the book "makes an important contribution to popular debates about the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The book is arguably the most detailed and thorough history available of the current anti-vaccine movement". The review noted one possible weakness: the book gives light coverage to the public's fundamental misunderstanding of the [[epidemiology of autism]], in that the public fears an "autism epidemic" that may not in fact be occurring. The review concluded with a call to scientists and physicians to follow Offit's lead in communicating to the public even uncomfortable truths about autism.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2009 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=544–6 |title= Offit Paul: ''Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure'' |author= Grinker, Roy Richard |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0679-y}}</ref>

Four months after its release, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the book had been endorsed widely by pediatricians, autism researchers, vaccine companies, and medical journalists, and was "galvanizing a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the United States." Many doctors are critical of "false equivalence" in media coverage of the vaccine issue, and now argue that reporters should treat the antivaccine lobby with the same level of indifference as [[AIDS denialism]] and other fringe theories.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |last=McNeil |first= Donald G., Jr. |title= Book Is Rallying Resistance to the Antivaccine Crusade |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html |work= [[New York Times]] |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2009-01-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090114210153/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html| archivedate= 14 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Later in 2009, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that the book effectively advocated for vaccines and refuted the vaccine–autism myth. It noted that a particular strength of the book is its outline of the scientific method and the basic principles of probability and causality, and its coverage of the difficulty of explaining science to the public, such as the difference between causality and coincidence. It noted as a weakness the book's several diversions into topics such as breast implants.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |year=2009 |volume=360 |issue=11 |pages=1159–60 |title=Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure|author=Edwards, Kathryn M. |doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev0809168 |last2=Modjarrad |first2=K. }}</ref>
