'''Gregory Bar Hebraeus''' (1226 – 30 July 1286) was a ''[[catholicos]]'' (bishop) of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] in the 13th  century.  He is noted for his works addressing philosophy, poetry, language, history, and theology;<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 5</ref> he has been called "one of the most learned and versatile men from the Syriac Orthodox Church" ([[William Wright (Orientalist)|Dr. William Wright]]).

Bar Hebraeus was born in the village of ʿEbra (Izoli, Turk.: Kuşsarayı) near [[Malatya]], [[Sultanate of Rûm]] (modern [[Turkey]], today province Elazig); his [[Arabic name]] was {{transl|ar|DIN|Abū'l-Faraj bin Hārūn al-Malaṭī}} ({{lang-ar|ابو الفرج بن هارون الملطي}}){{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. It appears that he took the [[Christian name]] Gregory ({{lang-syr|ܓܪܝܓܘܪܝܘܣ}} ''Grigorios''; {{lang-ar|غريغوريوس}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ġrīġūriyūs}}'') at his consecration as a [[bishop]]. Throughout his life, he was often referred to by the Syriac [[nickname]] Bar ʿEbrāyā ({{lang-syr|ܒܪ ܥܒܪܝܐ}}, which is pronounced and often transliterated as Bar ʿEbroyo in the West Syriac dialect of the Syriac Orthodox Church), giving rise to the Latinised name Bar Hebraeus. This nickname is often thought to imply a Jewish background (taken to mean 'Son of the Hebrew'). However, the evidence for this once popular view is slim. It is more likely that the name refers to the place of his birth, ʿEbrā, where the old road east of [[Malatya]] towards [[Kharput]] (modern [[Elazığ]]) and [[Amida (Mesopotamia)]] (modern [[Diyarbakır]]) crossed the [[Euphrates]].<ref>A few Syriac sources give Bar-Hebraeus's full Arabic name as {{transl|ar|DIN|Jamāluddīn Abū'l-Faraj Ġrīġūriyūs bin Tājuddīn Hārūn bin Tūmā al-Malaṭī}} ({{lang-ar|جمال الدين ابو الفرج غريغوريوس بن تاج الدين هارون بن توما الملطي}}). However, all references to this longer name are posthumous. The Syriac nickname Bar ʿEbrāyā is sometimes arabised as Ibn al-ʿIbrī ({{lang-ar|ابن العبري}}). Sometimes, Bar Hebraeus is said to have been given the [[baptismal name]] [[John (first name)|John]] ({{lang-syr|ܝܘܚܢܢ}}, ''{{unicode|Yōḥanan}}''), but this appears to be a scribal error. As a Syriac bishop, Bar Hebraeus is often given the [[honorific]] Mār ({{lang-syr|ܡܪܝ}}, pronounced Mor in West Syriac dialect), and thus Mar/Mor Gregory.</ref>

He collected in his numerous and elaborate treatises the results of such research in theology, philosophy, science and history as was in his time possible in Syria. Most of his works were written in [[Syriac]].  However he also wrote some in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which had become the common language in his day.

==Life==
A Syriac bishop, philosopher, poet, grammarian, physician, biblical commentator, historian, and theologian, he was the son of a physician, Aaron ({{transl|ar|DIN|Hārūn bin Tūmā al-Malaṭī}}, {{lang-ar|هارون بن توما الملطي}}). Under the care of his father he began as a boy (''a teneris unguiculis'') the study of [[medicine]] and of many other branches of knowledge, which he pursued as a youth at [[Antioch]] and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], and which he never abandoned. In 1246 he was consecrated bishop of [[Gubos (West Syrian Diocese)|Gubos]] by the Syrian Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius II]], and in 1255 was transferred to the [[episcopal see|see]] of [[Laqabin (West Syrian Diocese)|Laqabin]]. He was placed over the diocese of [[Aleppo]] by Dionysius (1252) and finally was made [[primate (religion)|primate]], or ''maphrian'', of the East by [[Ignatius III]] (1264). His episcopal duties did not interfere with his studies; he took advantage of the numerous visitations, which he had to make throughout his vast province, to consult the libraries and converse with the learned men whom he happened to meet. Thus he gradually accumulated an immense erudition, became familiar with almost all branches of secular and religious knowledge, and in many cases thoroughly mastered the bibliography of the various subjects which he undertook to treat. How he could have devoted so much time to such a systematic study, in spite of all the vicissitudes incident to the [[Mongol]] invasion, is almost beyond comprehension. The main claim of Bar Hebræus to our gratitude is not, however, in his original productions, but rather in his having preserved and systematized the work of his predecessors, either by way of condensation of by way of direct reproduction. Both on account of his virtues and of his science, Bar Hebræus was respected by all, and his death was mourned not only by men of his own faith, but also by the [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorian]]s and the [[Armenians]]. He died in [[Maraga]], [[Persia]], and was buried at the [[Mar Mattai Monastery]], near [[Mosul]]. He has left us an autobiography, to be found in [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani|Assemani]], ''Biblioth. Orient.'', II, 248-263; the account of his death (''ibid''.) was written by his own brother, [[Bar Sauma]].

==Works==

===Encyclopedic and philosophical===
His great encyclopedic work is his ''Hewath Hekhmetha'', "The Cream of Science", which deals with almost every branch of human knowledge, and comprises the whole Aristotelian discipline, after [[Avicenna]] and Arabian writers. This work, so far, has not been published, with the exception of one chapter, by [[Margoliouth]], in ''Analecta Orientalia ad poeticam Aristoteleam'' (London, 1887), 114-139. The rest is to be found only in MSS., preserved at [[Florence]], [[Oxford]], [[London]], and elsewhere. (2) ''Teghrath Teghratha'', "Commerce of Commerces", a résumé of the preceding, also unpublished. (3) ''Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha'', "Book of the Pupils of the Eyes"; compendium of [[logic]] and [[dialectics]]. (4) ''Kethabha dhe-Sewadh Sophia'', "Book of Speech of Wisdom"; compendium of [[physics]] and [[metaphysics]]. To these should be added a few translations of Arabic works into Syriac, as well as some treatises written directly in Arabic.

===Biblical===
The most important work of Bar Hebræus is ''Awsar Raze'', "Storehouse of Secrets", a commentary on the entire [[Bible]], both doctrinal and critical. Before giving his doctrinal exposition of a passage, he first considers its critical state. Although he uses the ''[[Peshitta]]'' as a basis, he knows that it is not perfect, and therefore controls it by the Hebrew, the [[Septuagint]], the Greek versions of [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], [[Theodotion]], [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], by Oriental versions, Armenian and Coptic, and finally by the other Syriac translations, Heraclean, [[Philoxenian]] and especially the ''[[Syro-hexaplar version|Syro-Hexapla]]''. The work of Bar Hebræus is of prime importance for the recovery of these versions and more specially for the ''[[Hexapla]]'' of [[Origen]], of which the ''Syro-Hexapla'' is a translation by [[Paul of Tella]]. His exegetical and doctrinal portions are taken from the [[Greek Fathers]] and previous Syrian Jacobite theologians. No complete edition of the work has yet been issued, but many individual books have been published at different times. (See bibliography at the end of article.)

===Historical===
Bar Hebraeus has left a large ecclesiastical history called ''Makhtbhanuth Zabhne'', ''Chronicon'', in which he considers history from the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] down to his own day. Bar Hebræus used almost all that had been written before him, showing particular favor to the now lost chronographic records published by [[Theophilus of Edessa]] (late 8th century, although he has this only through Michael the Syrian and other dependents).<ref name="todt">{{cite journal
|author=SR Todt
|title=Die syrische und die arabische Weltgeschichte des Bar Hebraeus
|year=1988
|journal=Der Islam
|volume=65
|pages=60–80}}. Conrad and so Hoyland assume Todt.</ref> The work is divided into two portions, often transmitted separately.<ref name="conrad">{{cite journal
|author=Lawrence Conrad
|title=On the Arabic Chronicle of Bar Hebraeus
|year=1994
|journal=Parole de l'Orient
|volume=19
|pages=319–78}}</ref>

The first portion deals with political and civil history and is known as the ''Chronicon Syriacum''.  The standard edition of the ''Chronicon Syriacum'' is that of [[Paul Bedjan|Bedjan]], ''Gregorii Barhebraei Chronicon Syriacum''.<ref>Paris: 1890</ref>  An English translation by [[E. A. Wallis Budge|Wallis Budge]] exists.

This was to give context to the second portion, known as the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' and covering the religious history.<ref name="conrad"/> That section begins with [[Aaron]] and consists of a series of entries of important individuals.  The first half covers the history of the West Syrian Church and the Patriarchs of Antioch, while the second half is devoted to the Eastern Church, the Nestorian Patriarchs, and the Jacobite Maphrians. The current edition of the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' is that of [[Jean Baptiste Abbeloos|Abbeloos]] and [[Thomas Joseph Lamy|Lamy]],<ref>3 vols., Louvain, 1872–77</ref> Syriac text, Latin translation. No English translation has ever been published, although an unpublished translation by [[Sebastian Brock]] of most of the first part exists.

Bar Hebraeus, later, decided to write a history for the edification of Christians rather than for the Church itself. This became ''Mukhtasar fî'l-Duwal''.<ref name="conrad"/> The latest and the best edition of his work is that of [[Anton Salihani|Fr. Anton Salihani]].<ref>Beirut: 1890</ref>  A Latin translation exists in the older edition of [[Edward Pococke]], (mis)translated ''Historia Compendosia Dynastiarum''.<ref name="conrad"/><ref>Oxford, 1663</ref>

===Theological===
In theology Bar Hebræus was a [[Miaphysite]]. He probably, however, thought that the differences between [[Catholic]]s, Nestorians, and the rest were of a theological, but not of a dogmatical nature, and that they did not affect the common faith; hence, he did not consider others as [[Heresy|heretics]], and was not himself considered as such, at least by the Nestorians and the Armenians. Indeed, he once mused 
:When I had given much thought and pondered on the matter, I became convinced that these quarrels among the different Christian Churches are not a matter of factual substance, but of words and terminology; for they all confess Christ our Lord to be perfect God and perfect human, without any commingling, mixing, or confusion of the natures... Thus I saw all the Christian communities, with their different christological positions, as possessing a single common ground that is without any difference between them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bar Hebraeus|title=Book of the Dove|location=Chapter IV|url=http://sor.cua.edu/Ecumenism/index.html}}</ref>

In this field, we have from him ''Menarath Qudhshe'', "Lamp of the Sanctuary", and the ''Kethabha dhe-Zalge'', "Book of Rays", a summary of the first. These works have not been published, and exist in manuscript in [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], London, Oxford, and [[Rome]]. Ascetical and moral theology were also treated by Bar Hebræus, and we have from him ''Kethabha dhe-Ithiqon'', "Book of Ethics", and ''Kethabha dhe-Yauna'', "Book of the Dove", an ascetical guide. Both have been edited by Bedjan in "Ethicon seu Moralia Gregorii Barhebræi" (Paris and Leipzig, 1898). The "Book of the Dove" was issued simultaneously by Cardahi (Rome, 1898). Bar Hebræus codified the juridical texts of the Jacobites, in a collection called ''Kethabha dhe-Hudhaye'', "Book of Directions", edited by Bedjan, "Barhebræi [[Nomocanon]]" (Paris, 1898). A Latin translation is to be found in [[Angelo Mai]], "Scriptorum Veter. Nova Collectio", vol. x. Bar Hebræus has left besides many other works. On grammatical subjects we have the "Book of Splendours" and "Book of the Spark", both edited by Martin, "Oeuvres grammaticales de Aboul Faradj dit Barhebræus" (2 vols., Paris, 1872); also works on mathematics, astronomy, cosmography, and medicine, some of which have been published, but others exist only in manuscript.

===Other works===
A full list of Bar Hebraeus's other works, and of editions of such of them as have been published, will be found in [[William Wright (Orientalist)|W. Wright]]'s ''Syriac Literature'', pp.&nbsp;268–281. The more important of them are:
#''Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha'' (Book of the Pupils of the Eyes), a treatise on logic or dialectics
#''Hewath Hekmetha'' (Butter of Wisdom), an exposition of the whole philosophy of Aristotle
#''Sullarat Haunãnãyã'' (Ascent of the Mind), a treatise on astronomy and cosmography, edited and translated by [[F. Nau]] (Paris, 1899)
#various medical works
#''Kethabha dhe-Zalge'' (Book of Rays), a treatise on grammar
#ethical works
#poems
#''Kethabha dhe-Thunnaye Mighaizjzikhanl'' (Book of Entertaining Stories), edited and translated by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] (London, 1897).

==Veneration==
He is regarded as a [[saint]] by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who hold his [[feast day]] on July 30.<ref name="Holweck">[[Frederick George Holweck|Holweck, F. G.]], ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints''. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co. 1924.</ref>
