'''Trihalomethanes''' ('''THM'''s) are [[chemical compound]]s in which three of the four hydrogen atoms of [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>) are replaced by [[halogen]] atoms.  Many trihalomethanes find uses in industry as [[solvent]]s or [[refrigerant]]s.  THMs are also environmental pollutants, and many are considered [[carcinogen]]ic. Trihalomethanes with all the same halogen atoms are called '''haloforms'''.

==Industrial uses==

===Refrigerants===
[[Trifluoromethane]] and [[chlorodifluoromethane]] are both used as [[refrigerant]]s in some applications.  Trihalomethanes released to the environment break down faster than [[haloalkane|chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), thereby doing much less damage to the [[ozone layer]] .  Chlorodifluoromethane is a refrigerant [[HCFC]], or [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon]], while fluoroform is an HFC, or [[hydrofluorocarbon]]. Fluoroform is not ozone depleting. 

Unfortunately, the breakdown of trihalomethane HCFCs does still result in the creation of some free chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere and subsequent ozone destruction.  Ideally, HCFCs will be phased out entirely in favour of entirely nonchlorinated refrigerants.

===Solvents===
Chloroform is a very common [[solvent]] used in organic chemistry.  It is a significantly less [[dipole|polar]] solvent than water, well-suited to dissolving many [[organic compound]]s.

Although still toxic and potentially carcinogenic, chloroform is significantly less harmful than [[carbon tetrachloride]].  Because of the health and regulatory issues associated with the use of carbon tetrachloride, in modern chemistry laboratories chloroform is used as a cheaper, cleaner alternative wherever possible.

==Water pollutants==
Trihalomethanes are formed as a by-product predominantly when [[chlorine]] is used to [[water purification|disinfect water]] for drinking. They represent one group of chemicals generally referred to as [[disinfection by-product]]s. They result from the reaction of chlorine and/or bromine with [[organic matter]] present in the water being treated. The THMs produced have been associated through epidemiological studies with some adverse health effects. Many governments set limits on the amount permissible in drinking water. However, trihalomethanes are only one group of many hundreds of possible disinfection by-products&mdash;the vast majority of which are not monitored&mdash;and it has not yet been clearly demonstrated which of these are the most plausible candidate for causation of these health effects. In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] limits the total concentration of the four chief constituents  ([[chloroform]], [[bromoform]], [[bromodichloromethane]], and [[dibromochloromethane]]), referred to as total trihalomethanes (TTHM), to 80 [[parts per billion]] in treated water.

[[Chloroform]] is also formed in [[swimming pools]] which are disinfected with [[chlorine]] or [[hypochlorite]] in the [[haloform reaction]] with organic substances (e.g. [[urine]], [[sweat]], [[hair]] and [[skin]] particles). Some of the THMs are quite volatile and may easily vaporize into the air. This makes it possible to inhale THMs while showering, for example. The EPA, however, has determined that this exposure is minimal compared to that from consumption. In swimmers, uptake of THMs is greatest via the skin with dermal absorption accounting for 80% of THM uptake.<ref>Lindstrom, AB et al. (1997) Alveolar breath sampling and analysis to assess trihalomethane exposures during competitive swimming training. Environ. Health Persp., 105 (6), 636-642</ref> Exercising in a chlorinated pool increases the toxicity of a "safe" chlorinated pool atmosphere<ref>Drobnic, F.et al. (1996) Assessment of chlorine exposure in swimmers during training. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 28 (2), 271-274</ref> with toxic effects of chlorine byproducts greater in young swimmers than older swimmers.<ref>Aiking,H. et al. (1994) Swimming pool chlorination: a health hazard? [[Toxicology Letters]], 72(1-3), 375-380</ref>
Studies in adolescents have shown an inverse relationship between serum testosterone levels and the amount of time spent in a public pools. Chlorination by-products have been linked as a probable cause.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2605.2011.01174.x/full</ref>
