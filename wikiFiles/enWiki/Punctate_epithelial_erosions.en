'''Punctate epithelial erosions''' is a pathology affecting the [[cornea]].  It is also known as '''punctate erosive keratopathy''' or '''superficial punctate keratitis'''.

== Signs and symptoms ==
It is a characterized by a breakdown or damage of the [[epithelium]] of the [[cornea]] in a pinpoint pattern, which can be seen with examination with a [[slit-lamp]].   Patients may present with [[non-specific symptom]]s such as red eye, tearing, foreign body sensation, [[photophobia]] and burning.

== Cause ==
Punctate epithelial erosions may be seen with different disorders:

*Trauma
*Exposure [[Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy|keratopathy]] from poor eyelide closure
*Ultraviolet or chemical burn
*Contact lens-related disorder such as toxicity or tight lens syndrome
*[[Trichiasis]]
*[[Entropion]] or [[ectropion]]
*[[Floppy eyelid syndrome]]
*Chemotherapy i.e. cytosine arabinoside
*[[Thygeson's Superficial Punctate Keratopathy]]

== Treatment ==
Due to the different underlying causes, proper diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis can only be determined by an eye care professional.
