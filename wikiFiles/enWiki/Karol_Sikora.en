==Promotion of Alternative Medicine==
Sikora and the School of medicine at Buckingham have in the past been supportive of [[alternative medicine]].<ref name=DC>{{cite web|author=David Colquhoun|url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881|title=University of Buckingham does the right thing.

Sikora was a Foundation Fellow of [[Prince Charles]]' now-defunct alternative medicine lobby group ''[[The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health]]''<ref>[http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/foundation_fellows.html FIH Foundation Fellows]</ref> and Chair of the ''Faculty of Integrated Medicine'', which is unaffiliated with any university and also includes Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson, who led Buckingham's "integrated medicine" course.<ref name=DC/> Sikora is also a "professional member" of the ''"[[The College of Medicine]]"'', a patient-oriented healthcare lobby group also linked to the Prince of Wales that appeared shortly after the collapse of the Prince's ''Foundation''.<ref>Sikora's [http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/professor-karol-sikora profile] is on the ''College of Medicine'' website.</ref> The ''College'' has been criticised extensively in the [[British Medical Journal]] for its promotion of alternative medicine.<ref name=BMJ_Cassidy>{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d3712 | date=15 June 2011 | title=Lobby Watch: The College of Medicine | author=Jane Cassidy | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3712.full | pmid=21677014 | pages=d3712}}</ref><ref name=BMJ_Colquhoun>{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4368 | date=12 July 2011 | title=The College of Medicine is Prince's Foundation reincarnated  | author=David Colquhoun | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4368.full | pmid=21750061 | pages=d4368}}</ref><ref name=BMJ_May>{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4372 | date=12 July 2011 | title=College of Medicine: What is integrative health? | author=James May | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4372.full | pmid=21750063 | pages=d4372}}</ref><ref name=BMJ_Ernst>{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4370 | date=12 July 2011 | title=College of Medicine or College of Quackery? | author=Edzard Ernst | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4370.full | pmid=21750062 | pages=d4370}}</ref><ref name=BMJ_COLLEGE>{{cite news | title=Prince’s foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine | author=Nigel Hawkes | publisher=British Medical Journal | year=2010 | volume=341 | pages=6126 | doi=10.1136/bmj.c6126|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full}}</ref> These claims have been contested by the College.<ref name=BMJ_response>{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4364.extract?sid=66683c7f-e8ba-4245-954b-0ebfbb090ea4 | title=College of Medicine replies to its critics | date=12 July 2011 | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4364 | author=George T Lewith, Graeme Catto, Michael Dixon, Christine Glover, Aidan Halligan, Ian Kennedy, Christopher Manning, David Peters | pages=d4364 | pmid=21750060}}</ref> He is on the advisory panel of complementary cancer care charity ''Penny Brohn Cancer Care,'' formerly the Bristol Cancer Help Centre of whom the Prince of Wales is patron, and is a patron of the Ian Rennie Hospice at Home.<ref>[http://www.pennybrohncancercare.org/page23.asp Vice Presidents and Senior Team] Penny Brohn Cancer Care</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irhh.org/sitehome/aboutus/people/patrons.html |title=Patrons & Vice Presidents |publisher=Irhh.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Statements by Sikora have been critical of unproven methods of alternative medicine, after Parliament member Lord Maurice Saatchi proposed a bill allowing doctors to use unproven experimental therapies, and when he spoke out against claims that an alkaline diet can cure cancer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maria |first=By |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/13/grieving_husband_pushes_bill_for_unproven_remedies/singleton/ |title=Grieving husband pushes bill for unproven remedies |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2255445/Marchioness-Worcester-Sorry-theres-thing-diet-cures-cancer.html |title=Marchioness of Worcester: Sorry, but there's no such thing as a diet that cures cancer &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>

== Controversies ==

===Release of Lockerbie bomber===
In September 2009, the convicted [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bomber]], [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds. The [[Daily Telegraph]] revealed that Sikora was one of three different doctors hired by the Libyan government to report to them about Megrahi's condition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/6143073/Revealed-Libya-paid-for-medical-advice-that-helped-Lockerbie-bombers-release.html |title=Revealed: Libya paid for medical advice that helped Lockerbie bomber's release |accessdate=6 September 2009 |last=Alderson |first=Andrew |date=5 September 2009 |publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' |location=London}}</ref> Sikora's report concluded that Megrahi had only 3 months to live due to terminal prostate cancer. Sikora has since admitted that the "3 months" timescale was suggested to him by the Libyans.  According to the Daily Telegraph, this was not the first time that Sikora had been economical with the truth.<ref>[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/willheaven/100008633/professor-karol-sikora-this-isn%E2%80%99t-the-lockerbie-doctor%E2%80%99s-first-pr-disaster/ Professor Karol Sikora: this isn’t the Lockerbie doctor’s first PR disaster] by Will Heaven, The Telegraph, September 6th, 2009</ref> Sikora's medical diagnosis was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister since it had been paid for by Libya, but his diagnosis did agree with the medical evidence that ''was'' used. Once released, Megrahi returned to Libya and far outlived the 3-month prognosis.<ref>[http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/05/doctor-released-lockerbie-bomber-could-live-much-longer/ Doctor: Released Lockerbie bomber could live much longer] CNN.com newsblog, July 5th, 2010</ref> In July 2010, in an interview with the [[Sunday Times]], Sikora said that "it was 'embarrassing' that Megrahi has lived much longer than expected." and "There was always a chance he could live for ten years, 20 years . . . But it's very unusual."<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1291939/ Fury as doctor who said Lockerbie bomber would die in three months admits: He could live for a decade] by Jack Doyle, the Mail Online, July 5th, 2010</ref> This quote was then used first by the UK press and then by a group of USA Senators <ref>[http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=397:senators-flawed-lockerbie-letter-was-influenced-by-media-reports/ US senators letter based on 'untrue' Megrahi press reports] Newsnet Scotland, July 19th, 2010</ref> to undermine the Scottish decision to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds, and then to link the release instead with BP contracts in Libya. In reply, the Scottish Government stated categorically that Sikora's medical opinion was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister.<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/925/0101520.pdf Reply to four US Senators re Megrahi] by Robin Naysmith, The Scottish Government, July 9th, 2010</ref> Sikora has since complained about the way journalists have reported his views and stated that there was probably a less than 1% chance of Megrahi living 10 years.<ref>[http://news.stv.tv/scotland/187126-lockerbie-doctor-speaks-out-over-megrahi-comments/ Lockerbie doctor speaks out over Megrahi comments] Stv, July 15th, 2010</ref>
