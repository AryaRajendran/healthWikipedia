[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002242241_medschool15m.html "School for Osteopaths Expected to Open in '07"] Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com. The Seattle Times, 15 Apr. 2005. Web. 01 Feb. 2012</ref> Pre-requisites for the program include: 
:* a bachelor's degree or higher from an accredited institution,
:* 12 semester hours of Biology, 8 semester hours of Inorganic Chemistry,
:* 8  semester hours of Organic Chemistry, 8 semester hours of Physics,
:* 6 semester hours of English, and completion of the [[MCAT]] exam.

The school currently has 18 sites for clinical rotations over the five-state region of [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  Rather than all of the students receiving their clinical training in Yakima, students are required to go to many parts of the Northwestern United States to receive hands-on training, often near to their homes. These sites include [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]; [[Blackfoot, Idaho]]; and [[Portland, Oregon]] among 15 others.

The campus consists of two buildings. Butler-Haney Hall is the center of the school where instruction and training occur, as well as housing the College of Osteopathic Medicine's Library. A new addition to Butler-Haney Hall will be completed in 2013. Cadwell Center opened in January 2011, and provides additional rooms for study, classroom and research space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pnwu.org/news/cadwell-student-center-gift/ |title=Cadwell Student Center Gift |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref>
