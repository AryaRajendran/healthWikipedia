'''Interferon induced transmembrane protein 5''' is a gene that encodes a membrane protein thought to play a role in bone mineralization. 

==Genomics==

The gene is located on the short arm of the Crick strand of [[chromosome 11]] (11p15.5). It is located with a cluster of [[interferon]] inducible genes but is itself not interferon inducible. The gene is 1,327 bases in length and encodes a protein of 132 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 14378 Daltons. Expression in adults is bone specific and highest in [[osteoblast]]s.  

The homolog in the [[mouse]] is located on chromosome 7. A homolog is also known to be present in [[lizard]]s. 

==Evolution==

The gene first appeared in bony fish and its bone specific expression appears to be limited to therian mammals.

==Biochemistry==

The protein has two transmembrane domains. It associates with [[FK506 binding protein]] 11.<ref name=Hanagata2011>Hanagata N, Li X (2011) Osteoblast-enriched membrane protein IFITM5 regulates the association of CD9 with an FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex and stimulates expression of interferon-induced genes.

==Clinical==

Mutations in the gene are associated with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] type 5.<ref name=Semler2012>Semler O, Garbes L, Keupp K, Swan D, Zimmermann K, Becker J, Iden S, Wirth B, Eysel P, Koerber F, Schoenau E, Bohlander SK, Wollnik B, Netzer C (2012) A mutation in the 5'-UTR of IFITM5 creates an in-frame start codon and causes autosomal-dominant osteogenesis imperfecta type V with hyperplastic callus.
