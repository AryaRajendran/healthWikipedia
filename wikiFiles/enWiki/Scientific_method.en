<!--Please do not change the lead sentence without first discussing on the talk page.-->The '''scientific method''' is a body of [[Scientific technique|techniques]] for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]], acquiring new [[knowledge]], or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.<ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=940">{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=940}}</ref> To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on [[empirical]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.<ref>
"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794–6}}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.
</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]."<ref>Oxford English Dictionary - entry for ''scientific''.</ref>

The chief characteristic which distinguishes the scientific method from other methods of acquiring knowledge is that scientists seek to let reality speak for itself,{{discuss}} supporting a theory when a theory's predictions are confirmed and challenging a theory when its predictions prove [[falsifiability|false]]. Although procedures vary from one [[fields of science|field of inquiry]] to another, identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methods of obtaining knowledge. Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design [[experiment]]al studies to test these hypotheses via predictions which can be derived from them. These steps must be repeatable, to guard against mistake or confusion in any particular experimenter. [[Scientific theory|Theories]] that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many independently derived hypotheses together in a coherent, supportive structure. Theories, in turn, may help form new hypotheses or place groups of hypotheses into context.

Scientific inquiry is generally intended to be as [[objectivity (science)|objective]] as possible in order to reduce biased interpretations of results. Another basic expectation is to document, [[Scientific data archiving|archive]] and [[Data sharing (Science)|share]] all data and [[methodology]] so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, giving them the opportunity to verify results by attempting to [[Reproducibility|reproduce]] them. This practice, called ''full disclosure'', also allows statistical measures of the [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of these data to be established (when data is sampled or compared to chance).

Scientific method has been practiced in some form for at least one thousand years<ref name="Alhazen">"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air. —Alhazen, translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from "Abhandlung über das Licht", J. Baarmann (ed. 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}}.
* He demonstrated his conjecture that "light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only" by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}} to prove that light travels in a straight line.
* [[David Hockney]], (2001, 2006) in ''Secret Knowledge: rediscovering the lost techniques of the old masters'' ISBN 0-14-200512-6 (expanded edition) cites Alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the [[camera obscura]], which Hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion from [[Charles M. Falco]]. ''Kitab al-Manazir'', which is Alhazen's ''[[Book of Optics]]'', at that time denoted ''Opticae Thesaurus, Alhazen Arabis'', was translated from Arabic into Latin for European use as early as 1270. Hockney cites Friedrich Risner's 1572 Basle edition of ''Opticae Thesaurus''. Hockney quotes Alhazen as the first clear description of the camera obscura in Hockney, p. 240.
"Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things.

[http://www.cosmopolitanuniversity.ac/library/LogicofScientificDiscoveryPopper1959.pdf The Logic of Scientific Discovery] pp. 17-20, 249-252, 437-438, and elsewhere.
* [[Leon Lederman]], for teaching [[physics first]], illustrates how to avoid confirmation bias: [[Ian Shelton]], in Chile, was initially skeptical that [[supernova 1987a]] was real, but possibly an artifact of instrumentation (null hypothesis), so he went outside and disproved his null hypothesis by observing SN 1987a with the naked eye. The [[Kamiokande]] experiment, in Japan, independently observed [[neutrino]]s from [[SN 1987a]] at the same time.</ref>

The overall process involves making conjectures ([[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct.<ref name=NA />  There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, they are better considered as general principles.<ref>{{harvnb|Gauch |2003|p=3}}</ref> Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (or to the same degree), and not always in the same order. As noted by [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866), "invention, sagacity, [and] genius"<ref>''History of Inductive Science'' (1837), and in ''Philosophy of Inductive Science'' (1840)</ref> are required at every step:

:'''Formulation of a question:''' The question can refer to the explanation of a specific ''[[observation]]'', as in "Why is the sky blue?", but can also be open-ended, as in "Does [[sound]] travel faster in air than in water?" or "How can I [[Drug design|design a drug]] to cure this particular [[disease]]?"  This stage also involves looking up and evaluating previous evidence from other scientists, including experience. If the answer is already known, a different question that builds on the previous evidence can be posed. When applying the scientific method to scientific research, determining a good question can be very difficult and affects the final outcome of the investigation.<ref>Schuster and Powers (2005), Translational and Experimental Clinical Research, Ch. 1. [http://books.google.com/books?id=C7pZftbI0ZMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Translational+and+Experimental+Clinical+Research&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZciuT_SzCOnOiAKNzIzfAw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Translational%20and%20Experimental%20Clinical%20Research&f=false Link.] This chapter also discusses the different types of research questions and how they are produced.</ref>

:'''Hypothesis''': An [[hypothesis]] is a conjecture, based on the knowledge obtained while formulating the question, that may explain the observed behavior of a part of our universe. The hypothesis might be very specific, e.g., Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] or [[Francis Crick]]'s "DNA makes RNA makes protein",<ref>This phrasing is attributed to [[Marshall Nirenberg]].</ref> or it might be broad, e.g., unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans.  A [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Definition of terms|statistical hypothesis]] is a conjecture about some [[statistical population|population]].  For example, the population might be people with a particular disease.  The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people.  Terms commonly associated with statistical hypotheses are [[null hypothesis]] and [[alternative hypothesis]].  A null hypothesis is the conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false, e.g., that the new drug does nothing and that any cures are due to chance effects.  Researchers normally want to show that the null hypothesis is false.  The alternative hypothesis is the desired outcome, e.g., that the drug does better than chance.   A final point: a scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested.

:'''Prediction:''' This step involves determining the logical consequences of the hypothesis. One or more predictions are then selected for further testing. The less likely that the prediction would be correct simply by coincidence, the stronger evidence it would be if the prediction were fulfilled; evidence is also stronger if the answer to the prediction is not already known, due to the effects of [[hindsight bias]] (see also [[postdiction]]).  Ideally, the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives; if two hypotheses make the same prediction, observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other. (These statements about the relative strength of evidence can be mathematically derived using [[Bayes' Theorem]].)

:'''Testing''': This is an investigation of whether the real world behaves as predicted by the hypothesis.  Scientists (and other people) test hypotheses by conducting [[experiments]].  The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observations]] of the real world agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from an hypothesis.  If they agree, confidence in the hypothesis increases; otherwise, it decreases.  Agreement does not assure that the hypothesis is true; future experiments may reveal problems.  [[Karl Popper]] advised scientists to try to falsify hypotheses, i.e., to search for and test those experiments that seem most doubtful. Large numbers of successful confirmations are not convincing if they arise from experiments that avoid risk.<ref>Karl R. Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', Routledge, 2003 ISBN 0-415-28594-1</ref>  Experiments should be designed to minimize possible errors, especially through the use of appropriate [[scientific control]]s.  For example, tests of medical treatments are commonly run as [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind tests]].  Test personnel, who might unwittingly reveal to test subjects which samples are the desired test drugs and which are [[placebo]]s, are kept ignorant of which are which.  Such hints can bias the responses of the test subjects.  Failure of an experiment does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false.  Experiments always depend on several hypotheses, e.g., that the test equipment is working properly, and a failure may be a failure of one of the auxiliary hypotheses.  (See the [[Duhem-Quine thesis]].) Experiments can be conducted in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]], at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars (using one of the working [[Mars rover|rovers]]), and so on. Astronomers do experiments, searching for planets around distant stars. Finally, most individual experiments address highly specific topics for reasons of practicality. As a result, evidence about broader topics is usually accumulated gradually.

:'''Analysis:''' This involves determining what the results of the experiment show and deciding on the next actions to take. The predictions of the hypothesis are compared to those of the null hypothesis, to determine which is better able to explain the data. In cases where an experiment is repeated many times, a [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] such as a [[chi-squared test]] may be required. If the evidence has falsified the hypothesis, a new hypothesis is required; if the experiment supports the hypothesis but the evidence is not strong enough for high confidence, other predictions from the hypothesis must be tested. Once a hypothesis is strongly supported by evidence, a new question can be asked to provide further insight on the same topic. Evidence from other scientists and experience are frequently incorporated at any stage in the process. Many iterations may be required to gather sufficient evidence to answer a question with confidence, or to build up many answers to highly specific questions in order to answer a single broader question.

This model underlies the [[scientific revolution]].<ref>  {{harvnb|Lindberg|2007|pp=2-3}}: "There is a danger that must be avoided. ... If we wish to do justice to the historical enterprise, we must take the past for what it was. And that means we must resist the temptation to scour the past for examples or precursors of modern science. ...My concern will be with the beginnings of scientific ''theories'', the methods by which they were formulated, and the uses to which they were put; ... "  </ref> One thousand years ago, Alhazen demonstrated the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them,<ref name="Alhazen" /> an approach which was advocated by Galileo in 1638 with the publication of ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|author-link=Galileo|title=[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e Dimonstrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuoue scienze]]|location=[[Leiden|Leida]]|publisher=Apresso gli [[House of Elzevir|Elsevirri]]|date=[[1638|M.D.C.XXXVIII]]|isbn=0-486-60099-8}}, Dover reprint of the 1914 Macmillan translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio of ''Two New Sciences'', [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Accademia dei Lincei|Linceo]] (1638).

===DNA example===
{| cellspacing=0

| vAlign=top |The basic [[#Elements of the scientific method|elements of the scientific method]] are illustrated by the following example from the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]]:
* ''[[#DNA-characterizations|Question]]'': Previous investigation of DNA had determined its chemical composition (the four [[nucleotides]]), the structure of each individual nucleotide, and other properties. It had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] in 1944,<ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985">{{harvnb|McCarty1985}}</ref> but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear.
* ''[[#DNA-hypotheses|Hypothesis]]'': [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure.<ref>October 1951, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=40}}:"That's what a helix should look like!" Crick exclaimed in delight (This is the Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theory of the transform of a helix).</ref>
* ''[[#DNA-predictions|Prediction]]'': If DNA had a helical structure, its X-ray diffraction pattern would be X-shaped.<ref>June 1952, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.</ref><ref name="Crick pp. 137-138">Watson did enough work on [[Tobacco mosaic virus]] to produce the diffraction pattern for a helix, per Crick's work on the transform of a helix. pp. 137-138, Horace Freeland Judson (1979) ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' ISBN 0-671-22540-5</ref> This prediction was determined using the mathematics of the helix transform, which had been derived by Cochran, Crick and Vand<ref name="HelixTransform">—

* ''[[#DNA-experiments|Experiment]]'': [[Rosalind Franklin]] crystallized pure DNA and performed [[X-ray diffraction]] to produce [[photo 51]]. The results showed an X-shape.
* ''[[#DNA-iterations|Analysis]]'': When Watson saw the detailed diffraction pattern, he immediately recognized it as a helix.<ref name="TeaTime">Friday, January 30, 1953. Tea time, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=52}}: Franklin confronts Watson and his paper - "Of course it [Pauling's pre-print] is wrong. DNA is not a helix." However, Watson then visits Wilkins' office, sees [[photo 51]], and immediately recognizes the diffraction pattern of a helical structure.  But additional questions remained, requiring additional iterations of their research. For example, the number of strands in the backbone of the helix (Crick suspected 2 strands, but cautioned Watson to examine that more critically), the location of the base pairs (inside the backbone or outside the backbone), etc.  One key point was that they realized that the quickest way to reach a result was not to continue a mathematical analysis, but to build a physical model.</ref><ref name="Watson 1968 167">"The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race." —{{harvnb|Watson|1968|p=167}} Page 168 shows the X-shaped pattern of the B-form of [[DNA]], clearly indicating crucial details of its helical structure to Watson and Crick.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p.52 dates the Franklin-Watson confrontation as Friday, January 30, 1953. Later that evening, Watson urges Wilkins to begin model-building immediately. But Wilkins agrees to do so only after Franklin's departure.</ref> He and Crick then produced their model, using this information along with the previously known information about DNA’s composition and about molecular interactions such as [[hydrogen bonds]].<ref name="SameShape">Saturday, February 28, 1953, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=57–59}}: Watson found the base pairing mechanism which explained [[Chargaff's rules]] using his cardboard models.</ref>
|}

The discovery became the starting point for many further studies involving the genetic material, such as the field of [[molecular genetics]], and it was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1962. Each step of the example is examined in more detail later in the article.

===Other components===
The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:

:'''Replication:''' If an experiment cannot be [[Reproducibility|repeated]] to produce the same results, this implies that the original results were in error. As a result, it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times, especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of [[Observational error|experimental error]]. For significant or surprising results, other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves, especially if those results would be important to their own work.

:'''External review:''' The process of [[peer review]] involves evaluation of the experiment by experts, who give their opinions anonymously to allow them to give unbiased criticism. It does not certify correctness of the results, only that the experiments themselves were sound (based on the description supplied by the experimenter). If the work passes peer review, which may require new experiments requested by the reviewers, it will be published in a peer-reviewed [[Academic journal|scientific journal]]. The specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work.

:'''Data recording and sharing:''' Scientists must record all data very precisely in order to reduce their own bias and aid in replication by others, a requirement first promoted by [[Ludwik Fleck]] (1896–1961) and others.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleck|1979|pp=xxvii-xxviii}}</ref> They must [[Data sharing|supply this data]] to other scientists who wish to replicate any results, extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain.<ref>"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."</ref>

==Scientific inquiry==
The goal of a scientific inquiry is to obtain [[knowledge]] in the form of [[Scientific theory|testable explanations]] that can
[[Predictability|predict]] the results of future experiments. This allows scientists to gain an understanding of reality, and later use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms (such as to cure disease). The better an explanation is at making predictions, the more useful it is, and the more likely it is to be correct. The most successful explanations, which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances, are called [[scientific theories]].

Most experimental results do not result in large changes in human understanding; improvements in theoretical scientific understanding is usually the result of a gradual synthesis of the results of different experiments, by various researchers, across different domains of science.<ref>Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education. pg 123</ref> Scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long, and in their acceptance in the scientific community. In general, explanations become accepted by a scientific community as evidence in favor is presented, and as presumptions that are inconsistent with the evidence are falsified.

===Properties of scientific inquiry===
[[Image:Jean Louis Théodore Géricault 001.jpg|thumb|Flying gallop [[Falsifiability|falsified]]; see image below.]]
{{Main|Sallie Gardner at a Gallop}}
[[Image:The Horse in Motion.jpg|thumb|Muybridge's photographs of ''The Horse in Motion,'' 1878, were used to answer the question whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time. This demonstrates a use of photography in science.]]
[[Image:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|An animation of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s studies of a [[horse]] [[Horse gallop|galloping]] in which the exact positions of the feet can no longer be clearly seen.]]

Scientific knowledge is closely tied to [[empirical]] findings, and always remains subject to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new experimental observation incompatible with it is found. That is, no theory can ever be considered completely [[Certainty|certain]], since new evidence falsifying it might be discovered. If such evidence is found, a new theory may be proposed, or (more commonly) it is found that minor modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence. The strength of a theory is related to how long it has persisted without falsification of its core principles.

Confirmed theories are also subject to subsumption by more accurate theories. For example, thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets were explained almost perfectly by Newton's laws. However, these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory ([[relativity]]), which explained both the (previously unexplained) exceptions to Newton's laws as well as predicting and explaining other observations such as the deflection of [[light]] by [[gravity]]. Thus independent, unconnected, scientific observations can be connected to each other, unified by principles of increasing explanatory power.<ref name="Brody 1993 44–45">{{harvnb|Brody |1993|pp=44–45}}</ref>

Since every new theory must explain even more than the previous one, any successor theory capable of subsuming it must meet an even higher standard, explaining both the larger, unified body of observations explained by the previous theory and unifying that with even more observations. In other words, as scientific knowledge becomes more accurate with time, it becomes increasingly harder to produce a more successful theory, simply because of the great success of the theories that already exist.<ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"/>  For example, the [[Theory of Evolution]] explains the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life on Earth]], how species adapt to their environments, and many other patterns observed in the natural world;<ref name="Hall08">{{cite book | editor1-last=Hall | editor1-first=B. K. | editor2-last=Hallgrímsson | editor2-first=B. |title = Strickberger's Evolution |year = 2008 |edition = 4th |publisher = Jones & Bartlett |isbn = 0-7637-0066-5 |url = http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |page = 762 }}</ref><ref name="Cracraft05">{{cite book | editor1-last=Cracraft | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=Donoghue | editor2-first=M.

In subsequent modifications, it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

===Beliefs and biases===
Scientific methodology directs that [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] be tested in [[Scientific control|controlled]] conditions which can be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]] by others. The [[scientific community|scientific community's]] pursuit of experimental control and reproducibility diminishes the effects of [[cognitive biases]].

For example, pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results, as in [[confirmation bias]]; this is a [[heuristic]] that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief, even if another observer might disagree (in other words, people tend to observe what they expect to observe).

A historical example is the conjecture that the legs of a [[Horse gallop|galloping]] horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse's legs touches the ground, to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters. However, the first stop-action pictures of a horse's gallop by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] showed this to be false, and that the legs are instead gathered together.<ref>{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1954}} p.166 shows how the 'flying gallop' image propagated from China to the West.</ref>

Another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new, surprising statements (see [[appeal to novelty]]), which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true.<ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=940"/>

In contrast to the requirement for scientific knowledge to correspond to reality, beliefs based on [[myth]] or stories can be believed and acted upon irrespective of truth,<ref>"A myth is a belief given uncritical acceptance by members of a group ..." —Weiss, ''Business Ethics'' p. 15, as cited by Ronald R. Sims (2003) ''Ethics and corporate social responsibility: why giants fall'' p.21</ref> often taking advantage of the [[narrative fallacy]] that when narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe.<ref>[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. {{harvnb|Taleb|2007|p=72}} lists ways to avoid narrative fallacy and confirmation bias.</ref><ref>For more on the narrative fallacy, see also {{harvnb|Fleck|1979|p=27}}: "Words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them. ... Such proto-ideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized. ... Once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed, it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it."</ref> Myths intended to be taken as true must have their elements assumed [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']], while science requires testing and validation [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] before ideas are accepted.<ref>"Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ...  Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", —Pages 1-4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-63-032-X</ref>

==Elements of the scientific method==
There are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry. The [[scientific community]] and [[philosophers of science]] generally agree on the following classification of method components. These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of [[natural science]]s than [[social science]]s. Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below.

:Four essential elements<ref>See [[Hypothetico-deductive model|the hypothethico-deductive method]], for example, {{harvnb|Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=236}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jevons|1874|pp=265–6}}.</ref><ref>pp.65,73,92,398 —Andrew J.

Fifteen hundred years after Kidinnu, [[Al-Batani]], born in what is now Turkey, would use the collected data and improve Hipparchus' value for the precession of the Earth's axis. Al-Batani's value, 54.5 arc-seconds per year, compares well to the current value of 49.8 arc-seconds per year (26,000 years for Earth's axis to round the circle of [[nutation]]).</ref> [[recursion]]s,<ref>Recursion example: the Earth is itself a magnet, with its own North and South Poles [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] (in Latin 1600) ''De Magnete'', or ''On Magnetism and Magnetic Bodies''.

These ... everyday experiences we do not discover without deliberately directing our attention to them. Collecting information about these is ''observation''." —[[Hans Christian Ørsted]]("First Introduction to General Physics" ¶13, part of a series of public lectures at the University of Copenhagen. Copenhagen 1811, in Danish, printed by Johan Frederik Schulz. In Kirstine Meyer's 1920 edition of Ørsted's works, vol.'''III''' pp. 151-190. ) "First Introduction to Physics: the Spirit, Meaning, and Goal of Natural Science".

:* [[#Experiments|Experiments]]<ref>Salviati speaks: "I greatly doubt that Aristotle ever tested by experiment whether it be true that two stones, one weighing ten times as much as the other, if allowed to fall, at the same instant, from a height of, say, 100 cubits, would so differ in speed that when the heavier had reached the ground, the other would not have fallen more than 10 cubits." [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/tns61.htm Two New Sciences (1638)] —{{harvnb|Galileo|1638|pp=61–62}}. A more extended quotation is referenced by {{harvnb|Moulton|Schifferes|1960|pp=80–81}}.</ref> ([[Experiment|tests]] of all of the above)

Each element of the scientific method is subject to [[peer review]] for possible mistakes. These activities do not describe all that scientists do ([[#Dimensions of practice|see below]]) but apply mostly to experimental sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology). The elements above are often taught in [[education|the educational system]] as "the scientific method".<ref>In the [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based education]] paradigm, the stage of "characterization, observation, definition, …" is more briefly summed up under the rubric of a Question</ref>

The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity.<ref>"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science." —{{harvnb|Einstein|Infeld|1938|p=92}}.</ref> In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow,
but is rather an [[#Evaluation and improvement|ongoing cycle]], constantly developing more useful, accurate and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's ''Principia''. On the contrary, if the astronomically large, the vanishingly small, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories — all phenomena Newton could not have observed — Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase our confidence in Newton's work.

A linearized, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding:<ref>Crawford S, Stucki L (1990), "Peer review and the changing research record", "J Am Soc Info Science", vol. 41, pp 223-228</ref>

# Define a question
# Gather information and resources (observe)
# Form an explanatory hypothesis
# Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] manner
# Analyze the data
# Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis
# Publish results
# Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

The iterative cycle inherent in this step-by-step method goes from point 3 to 6 back to 3 again.

While this schema outlines a typical hypothesis/testing method,<ref>''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Gauch|2003}}, esp. chapters 5-8</ref> it should also be noted that a number of philosophers, historians and sociologists of science (perhaps most notably [[Paul Feyerabend]]) claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways science is actually practiced.

The "operational" paradigm combines the concepts of [[operational definition]], [[instrumentalism]], and [[utility]]:

The essential elements of scientific method are [[operation (mathematics)|operations]], [[observation]]s, [[scientific modeling|models]], and a [[utility function]] for evaluating models.<ref>Cartwright, Nancy (1983), ''How the Laws of Physics Lie''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-824704-4</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}}
* [[Operation (mathematics)|Operation]] - Some action done to the system being investigated
* [[Observation]] - What happens when the operation is done to the system
* [[Scientific modeling|Model]] - A [[fact]], [[hypothesis]], [[theory]], or the phenomenon itself at a certain moment
* [[Utility function|Utility Function]] - A measure of the usefulness of the model to explain, predict, and control, and of the cost of use of it. One of the elements of any scientific utility function is the [[Scientific modeling|refutability]] of the model. Another is its [[simplicity]], on the [[Principle of Parsimony]] more commonly known as [[Occam's Razor]].

===Characterizations===
The scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation. (The ''subjects'' can also be called [[:Category:Lists of unsolved problems|''unsolved problems'']] or the ''unknowns''.) For example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] conjectured, correctly, that [[St. Elmo's fire]] was [[electrical]] in [[nature]], but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects, careful thought may also [[logical consequence|entail]] some definitions and observations; the [[observations]] often demand careful [[measurements]] and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-sciences]], such as alchemy, and science, such as chemistry or biology. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis|regression]], performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations. The measurements often require specialized [[scientific instrument]]s such as thermometers, spectroscopes, particle accelerators, or voltmeters, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement.

</ref> }}

====Uncertainty====
Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their [[uncertainty]]. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations. Or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken.

====Definition====
Measurements demand the use of ''[[operational definition]]s'' of relevant quantities. That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or "idealized" definition. For example, [[electrical current]], measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of "mass" ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a particular kilogram of platinum-iridium kept in a laboratory in France.

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its [[natural language]] usage. For example, [[mass]] and [[weight]] overlap in meaning in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in [[mechanics]]. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their [[units of measurement|units of measure]] which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.

New theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined. For example, [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] first paper on [[Special relativity|relativity]] begins by defining [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] and the means for determining [[length]]. These ideas were skipped over by [[Isaac Newton]] with, "''I do not define [[time in physics#Galileo: the flow of time|time]], space, place and [[motion (physics)|motion]], as being well known to all.''" Einstein's paper then demonstrates that they (viz., absolute time and length independent of motion) were approximations. [[Francis Crick]] cautions us that when characterizing a subject, however, it can be premature to define something when it remains ill-understood.<ref>
Crick, Francis (1994), ''The Astonishing Hypothesis'' ISBN 0-684-19431-7 p.20
</ref> In Crick's study of [[consciousness]], he actually found it easier to study [[awareness]] in the [[visual system]], rather than to study [[free will]], for example. His cautionary example was the gene; the gene was much more poorly understood before Watson and Crick's pioneering discovery of the structure of DNA; it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene, before them.

====DNA-characterizations====
<span style="vertical-align:-120%">[[Image:DNA icon (25x25).png|left]]</span> The [[DNA#History of DNA research|history]] of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a classic example of [[#Elements of the scientific method|the elements of the scientific method]]: in 1950 it was known that [[genetic inheritance]] had a mathematical description, starting with the studies of [[Gregor Mendel]], and that DNA contained genetic information (Oswald Avery's ''transforming principle'').<ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"/> But the mechanism of storing genetic information (i.e., genes) in DNA was unclear. Researchers in [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg's]] laboratory at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] made [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]] pictures of various [[molecule]]s, starting with [[crystal]]s of [[salt]], and proceeding to more complicated substances. Using clues painstakingly assembled over decades, beginning with its chemical composition, it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of DNA, and the X-ray images would be the vehicle.<ref>{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p.34</ref> [[Scientific method#DNA-hypotheses|..''2. DNA-hypotheses'']]

====Another example: precession of Mercury====
[[Image:Perihelion precession.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apsidal precession|Precession]] of the [[perihelion]] (exaggerated)]]

The characterization element can require extended and extensive study, even centuries. It took thousands of years of measurements, from the [[Chaldea]]n, [[India]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Arab]]ic and [[European ethnic groups|European]] astronomers, to fully record the motion of planet [[Earth]]. Newton was able to include those measurements into consequences of his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. But the [[perihelion]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s [[orbit]] exhibits a precession that cannot be fully explained by Newton's laws of motion (see diagram to the right), though it took quite some time to realize this. The observed difference for Mercury's [[Apsidal precession|precession]] between Newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to Einstein as a possible early test of his theory of [[General Relativity]]. His relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than did Newtonian theory (the difference is approximately 43 arc-seconds per century), .

===Hypothesis development===
{{Main|Hypothesis formation}}

An [[hypothesis]] is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena.

Normally hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]]. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have — their own creativity, ideas from other fields, [[inductive reasoning|induction]], [[Bayesian inference]], and so on — to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], borrowing a page from [[Aristotle]] (''[[Prior Analytics]]'', [[Inquiry#Abduction|2.25]]) described the incipient stages of [[inquiry]], instigated by the "irritation of doubt" to venture a plausible guess, as [[Inquiry#Abduction|''abductive reasoning'']]. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a "flash of inspiration", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. [[Michael Polanyi]] made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.

[[William Glen (geologist and historian)|William Glen]] observes that

: the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived "truth", or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate … bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.<ref>{{harvnb|Glen|1994|pp=37–38}}.</ref>

In general scientists tend to look for theories that are "[[Elegance|elegant]]" or "[[beauty|beautiful]]". In contrast to the usual English use of these terms, they here refer to a theory in accordance with the known facts, which is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. [[Occam's Razor]] serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.

====DNA-hypotheses====
<span style="vertical-align:-120%">[[Image:DNA icon (25x25).png|left]]</span> [[Linus Pauling]] proposed that DNA might be a triple helix.<ref>
"The structure that we propose is a three-chain structure, each chain being a helix" — Linus Pauling, as quoted on p. 157 by Horace Freeland Judson (1979), ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' ISBN 0-671-22540-5</ref> This hypothesis was also considered by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong<ref>
{{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=49–50}}: January 28, 1953 - Watson read Pauling's pre-print, and realized that in Pauling's model, DNA's phosphate groups had to be un-ionized. But DNA is an acid, which contradicts Pauling's model.
</ref> and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. So, the race was on to figure out the correct structure (except that Pauling did not realize at the time that he was in a race—[[#DNA-predictions|see section on "DNA-predictions" below)]]

===Predictions from the hypothesis===
{{Main|Prediction in science}}

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s, by [[reasoning]] including [[deductive reasoning]]. It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature. The prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities.

It is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown. Only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true. If the outcome is already known, it's called a consequence and should have already been considered while [[Scientific method#Hypothesis development|formulating the hypothesis]].

If the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience, the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense. A new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible. Thus, much scientifically based speculation might convince one (or many) that the hypothesis that other intelligent species exist is true.  But since there no experiment now known which can test this hypothesis, science itself can have little to say about the possibility. In future, some new technique might lead to an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science.

====DNA-predictions====
<span style="vertical-align:-120%">[[Image:DNA icon (25x25).png|left]]</span> [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], and others hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure. This implied that DNA's X-ray diffraction pattern would be 'x shaped'.<ref name="Crick pp. 137-138"/><ref>
June 1952. as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.
</ref> This prediction followed from the work of Cochran, Crick and Vand<ref name="HelixTransform"/> (and independently by Stokes). The Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces x shaped patterns.

In their first paper, Watson and Crick also noted that the [[double helix]] structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]], writing "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".<ref>{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p.68: ''Nature'' April 25, 1953.</ref> [[DNA experiments|'' ..4. DNA-experiments'']]

====Another example: general relativity====
[[Image:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[gravitational lensing|Einstein's prediction (1907): Light bends in a gravitational field]]]]

Einstein's theory of [[General Relativity]] makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of [[space-time]], such as that [[light]] bends in a [[gravitational field]], and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field. [[Arthur Eddington]]'s observations made during a 1919 [[solar eclipse]] supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian [[gravitation]].<ref>In March 1917, the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] announced that on May 29, 1919, the occasion of a [[total eclipse]] of the sun would afford favorable conditions for testing Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]]. One expedition, to [[Sobral, Ceará]], [[Brazil]], and Eddington's expedition to the island of [[Principe]] yielded a set of photographs, which, when compared to photographs taken at [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] and at [[Greenwich Observatory]] showed that the deviation of light was measured to be 1.69 [[arc-second]]s, as compared to Einstein's desk prediction of 1.75 [[arc-second]]s. — Antonina Vallentin (1954), ''Einstein'', as quoted by Samuel Rapport and Helen Wright (1965), ''Physics'', New York: Washington Square Press, pp 294-295.</ref>

===Experiments===
{{Main|Experiment}}

Once predictions are made, they can be sought by experiments. If the test results contradict the predictions, the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable. Sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed, when compared to a [[crucial experiment]]. If the experimental results confirm the predictions, then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct, but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to [[#Evaluation and improvement|further testing.]] The [[experimental control]] is a technique for dealing with observational error. This technique uses the contrast between multiple samples (or observations) under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same. We vary the conditions for each measurement, to help isolate what has changed. [[Mill's canons]] can then help us figure out what the important factor is.<ref>[[John Stuart Mill|Mill, John Stuart]], "A System of Logic", University Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, 2002, ISBN 1-4102-0252-6.</ref> [[Factor analysis]] is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect.

Depending on the predictions, the experiments can have different shapes. It could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting, a [[double-blind]] study or an archaeological [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Even taking a plane from [[New York]] to [[Paris]] is an experiment which tests the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamical]] hypotheses used for constructing the plane.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed record keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others. Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of [[Hipparchus]] (190-120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]] can be seen in the works of [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721-815 CE), [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]] (853–929) and Alhazen (965-1039).<ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]], ''De Motu Stellarum'' [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation from Arabic to Latin in 1116]], as cited by "Battani, al-" (c.858-929) ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 15th. ed. Al-Battani is known for his accurate observations at al-Raqqah in Syria, beginning in 877. His work includes measurement of the annual precession of the equinoxes.</ref>

====DNA-experiments====
<span style="vertical-align:-120%">[[Image:DNA icon (25x25).png|left]]</span> Watson and Crick showed an initial (and incorrect) proposal for the structure of DNA to a team from Kings College - [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[Maurice Wilkins]], and [[Raymond Gosling]]. Franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content. Later Watson saw Franklin's detailed [[Photo 51|X-ray diffraction images]] which showed an [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/photo51/ X-shape] and was able to confirm the structure was helical.<ref name="TeaTime"/><ref name="Watson 1968 167"/> This rekindled Watson and Crick's model building and led to the correct structure. [[Scientific method#DNA-characterizations|''..1. DNA-characterizations'']]

===Evaluation and improvement===
The scientific method is iterative. At any stage it is possible to refine its [[accuracy and precision]], so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject.

Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction, and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.

Watson now felt confident enough to inform Crick. (Of course, 'unlike with unlike' increases the number of possible [[codon]]s, if this scheme were a [[genetic code]].)

===Confirmation===
Science is a social enterprise, and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community. Researchers have given their lives for this vision; [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] was killed by [[ball lightning]] (1753) when attempting to replicate the 1752 kite-flying experiment of [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref>
See, e.g., ''Physics Today'', '''59'''(1), p42. [http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_59/iss_1/42_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1 Richmann electrocuted in St. Petersburg (1753)]
</ref>

To protect against bad science and fraudulent data, government research-granting agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]], and science journals including ''Nature'' and ''Science'', have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before. [[Scientific data archiving]] can be done at a number of national archives in the U.S. or in the [[World Data Center]].

==Models of scientific inquiry==
{{Main|Models of scientific inquiry}}

===Classical model===
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from Aristotle,<ref>

''Wikisource'' [[s:The Fixation of Belief|Eprint]].</ref> [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|p|ɜr|s}} like "purse"; 1839–1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless.<ref name=Doubt>"What one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt; but a man should train himself to doubt," said Peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography; see Ketner, Kenneth Laine (2009) "Charles Sanders Peirce: Interdisciplinary Scientist" in ''The Logic of Interdisciplinarity''). Peirce held that actual, genuine doubt originates externally, usually in surprise, but also that it is to be sought and cultivated, "provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself, and no counterfeit nor paper substitute"; in "Issues of Pragmaticism", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481-99, see [http://www.archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/484/mode/1up p. 484], and [http://www.archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/491/mode/1up p. 491]. (Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 438-63, see 443 and 451).</ref> He outlined four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. It goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can shine but tend to be transitory.
# The method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lived, but it cannot operate thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn of other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The scientific method — the method wherein inquiry regards itself as [[Fallibilism|fallible]] and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that slow, stumbling [[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]] can be dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment in practical matters, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,<ref>Peirce (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), pp. 105-22, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 27-41.</ref> which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.<ref name=F.R.L.>" ... in order to learn, one must desire to learn ..."—Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 135-40, [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]</ref> The scientific method excels the others by being deliberately designed to arrive — eventually — at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.<ref name=Fixation/><ref name=Vital>Peirce, C. S., ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, in paragraph 582, from 1898:
{{quote|... [rational] inquiry of every type, fully carried out, has the vital power of self-correction and of growth. This is a property so deeply saturating its inmost nature that it may truly be said that there is but one thing needful for learning the truth, and that is a hearty and active desire to learn what is true.}}</ref>

For Peirce, rational inquiry implies presuppositions about truth and the real; to reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the real is discoverable and independent of our vagaries of opinion. In that vein he defined truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object and, pragmatically, not as actual consensus of some definite, finite community (such that to inquire would be to poll the experts), but instead as that final opinion which all investigators ''would'' reach sooner or later but still inevitably, if they were to push investigation far enough, even when they start from different points.<ref name=How>Peirce (1877), "How to Make Our Ideas Clear", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 286–302. Reprinted often, including ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 388–410, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 124–41. ''Arisbe''[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/ideas/id-frame.htm Eprint]. ''Wikisource'' [[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|Eprint]].</ref> In tandem he defined the real as a true sign's object (be that object a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law), which is what it is independently of any finite community's opinion and, pragmatically, depends only on the final opinion destined in a sufficient investigation. That is a destination as far, or near, as the truth itself to you or me or the given finite community. Thus his theory of inquiry boils down to "Do the science." Those conceptions of truth and the real involve the idea of a community both without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed) and capable of definite increase of knowledge.<ref name=4Incapacities>Peirce (1868), "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–57.

The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."</ref>

Paying special attention to the generation of explanations, Peirce outlined the scientific method as a coordination of three kinds of inference in a purposeful cycle aimed at settling doubts, as follows (in §III–IV in "A Neglected Argument"<ref name=NA>Peirce (1908), "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, pp. 90-112. [[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]] with added notes. Reprinted with previously unpublished part, ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 452-85, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 434-50, and elsewhere.</ref> except as otherwise noted):

1. '''[[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]]''' (or retroduction). Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon. Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the "facile and natural", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and, without it, there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry (often multi-generational) toward new truths.<ref name=PAP>Peirce (c. 1906), "PAP (Prolegomena for an Apology to Pragmatism)" (Manuscript 293, not the like-named article), ''The New Elements of Mathematics'' (NEM) 4:319-320, see first quote under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.</ref> Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability<ref name=SuitableTest>Peirce, Carnegie application (L75, 1902), ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 37-38: {{quote|For it is not sufficient that a hypothesis should be a justifiable one. Any hypothesis which explains the facts is justified critically. But among justifiable hypotheses we have to select that one which is suitable for being tested by experiment.}}</ref> and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.<ref name=econ>Peirce (1902), Carnegie application, see MS L75.329-330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:
{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}</ref> Peirce calls [[Pragmaticism|his pragmatism]] "the logic of abduction".<ref name=LogAbduc>Peirce (1903), "Pragmatism — The Logic of Abduction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 195-205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].</ref> His [[pragmatic maxim]] is: "Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object".<ref name=How /> His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects — a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them. It favors efficiency. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, and incomplexity.<ref name=20Qs>Peirce, "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see pp. 107-9. On Twenty Questions, p. 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}</ref> One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.<ref name=econ />

2. '''[[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]]'''. Two stages:
:i. Explication. Unclearly premissed, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible.
:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, Theorematic.

3. '''[[Inductive reasoning|Induction]]'''. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general<ref name=How />) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead;<ref name=ProbInduc>Peirce (1878), "The Probability of Induction", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705-18, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA718 718] ''Google Books''; [http://www.archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted often, including (''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 669-93), (''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 155-69).</ref> anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:
:i. Classification. Unclearly premissed, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.
:ii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude (the enumeration of instances) or Gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual Induction is Qualitative or Quantitative; if Qualitative, then dependent on [[weighting]]s of qualities or characters;<ref>Peirce (1905 draft "G" of "A Neglected Argument"), "Crude, Quantitative, and Qualitative Induction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 755–760, see 759. Find under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/induction.html Induction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.</ref> if Quantitative, then dependent on measurements, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Probability and statistics|or on statistics]], or on countings.
:iii. Sentential Induction. "...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".

===Computational approaches===
Many subspecialties of [[applied logic]] and [[computer science]], such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[machine learning]], [[computational learning theory]], [[inferential statistics]], and [[knowledge representation]], are concerned with setting out computational, logical, and statistical frameworks for the various types of inference involved in scientific inquiry. In particular, they contribute [[abductive reasoning|hypothesis formation]], [[deductive reasoning|logical deduction]], and [[inductive reasoning|empirical testing]]. Some of these applications draw on [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] of [[complexity]] from [[algorithmic information theory]] to guide the making of predictions from prior [[probability distribution|distributions]] of experience, for example, see the complexity measure called the ''[[speed prior]]'' from which a computable strategy for optimal inductive reasoning can be derived.

==Communication and community==
Frequently the scientific method is employed not only by a single person, but also by several people cooperating directly or indirectly. Such cooperation can be regarded as one of the defining elements of a [[scientific community]]. Various techniques have been developed to ensure the integrity of scientific methodology within such an environment.

===Peer review evaluation===
Scientific journals use a process of ''[[peer review]]'', in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three) fellow (usually anonymous) scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. The referees may or may not recommend publication, publication with suggested modifications, or, sometimes, publication in another journal. This serves to keep the scientific literature free of unscientific or [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] work, to help cut down on obvious errors, and generally otherwise to improve the quality of the material. The peer review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: problems of "[[groupthink]]" can interfere with open and fair deliberation of some new research.<ref>. Brown, C. (2005) Overcoming Barriers to Use of Promising Research Among Elite Middle East Policy Groups, Journal of Social Behaviour and Personality, Select Press.</ref>

===Documentation and replication===
{{Main|Reproducibility}}
Sometimes experimenters may make systematic errors during their experiments, unconsciously veer from scientific method ([[Pathological science]]) for various reasons, or, in rare cases, deliberately report false results. Consequently, it is a common practice for other scientists to attempt to repeat the experiments in order to duplicate the results, thus further validating the hypothesis.

====Archiving====
As a result, researchers are expected to practice [[scientific data archiving]] in compliance with the policies of government funding agencies and scientific journals. Detailed records of their experimental procedures, raw data, statistical analyses and source code are preserved in order to provide evidence of the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure and assist in [[Reproducibility|reproduction]]. These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis, and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery.

====Data sharing====
When additional information is needed before a study can be reproduced, the author of the study is expected to provide it promptly. If the author refuses to [[data sharing|share data]], appeals can be made to the journal editors who published the study or to the institution which funded the research.

====Limitations====
Since it is impossible for a scientist to record ''everything'' that took place in an experiment, facts selected for their apparent relevance are reported. This may lead, unavoidably, to problems later if some supposedly irrelevant feature is questioned. For example, [[Heinrich Hertz]] did not report the size of the room used to test Maxwell's equations, which later turned out to account for a small deviation in the results. The problem is that parts of the theory itself need to be assumed in order to select and report the experimental conditions. The observations are hence sometimes described as being 'theory-laden'.

===Dimensions of practice===
{{Further|Rhetoric of science}}

The primary constraints on contemporary science are:
* Publication, i.e. [[Peer review]]
* Resources (mostly funding)
It has not always been like this: in the old days of the "[[gentleman scientist]]" funding (and to a lesser extent publication) were far weaker constraints.

Both of these constraints indirectly require scientific method — work that violates the constraints will be difficult to publish and difficult to get funded. Journals require submitted papers to conform to "good scientific practice" and this is mostly enforced by peer review. Originality, importance and interest are more important - see for example the [http://www.nature.com/nature/submit/get_published/index.html author guidelines] for [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].

==Philosophy and sociology of science==
{{Main|Philosophy of science|Sociology of science}}

Philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method, at what separates [[Demarcation problem|science from non-science]], and the [[Research ethics|ethic]] that is implicit in science. There are basic assumptions derived from philosophy that form the base of the scientific method - namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions from [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] form the basis on which science is grounded. [[Logical positivism|Logical Positivist]], [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[falsifiability|falsificationist]], and other theories have claimed to give a definitive account of the logic of science, but each has in turn been criticized.

[[Thomas Kuhn]] examined the history of science in his ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', and found that the actual method used by scientists differed dramatically from the then-espoused method. His observations of science practice are essentially sociological and do not speak to how science is or can be practiced in other times and other cultures.

[[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have done extensive work on the "theory laden" character of observation. Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation is dependent on the conceptual framework of the observer, using the concept of [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description.<ref>{{Citation

Kuhn (1961) said the scientist generally has a theory in mind before designing and undertaking experiments so as to make empirical observations, and that the "route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward". This implies that the way in which theory is tested is dictated by the nature of the theory itself, which led Kuhn (1961, p.&nbsp;166) to argue that "once it has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed".<ref>[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas S.]], "The Function of Measurement in Modern Physical Science", ''ISIS'' 52(2), 161–193, 1961.</ref>

[[Paul Feyerabend]] similarly examined the history of science, and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process. In his book ''[[Against Method]]'' he argues that scientific progress is ''not'' the result of applying any particular method. In essence, he says that for any specific method or norm of science, one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science. Thus, if believers in scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule, Feyerabend jokingly suggests, it should be 'anything goes'.<ref>[[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend, Paul K.]], ''Against Method, Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'', 1st published, 1975. Reprinted, Verso, London, UK, 1978.
</ref> Criticisms such as his led to the [[strong programme]], a radical approach to the [[sociology of science]].

The [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy. This ongoing debate, known as the [[science wars]], is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between the postmodernist and [[Scientific realism|realist]] camps. Whereas postmodernists assert that scientific knowledge is simply another discourse (note that this term has special meaning in this context) and not representative of any form of fundamental truth, [[Scientific realism|realists]] in the scientific community maintain that scientific knowledge does reveal real and fundamental truths about reality. Many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate method of deriving truth.<ref>

===Role of chance in discovery===
{{Main|Luck in science}}
Somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been ''stumbled upon'', rather than sought out. This may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky.<ref name=DunbarLuck>Dunbar, K., & Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M. E. Gorman, R. D. Tweney, D. Gooding & A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technical Thinking (pp. 57-79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> [[Louis Pasteur]] is credited with the famous saying that "Luck favours the prepared mind", but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be 'prepared for luck' in the scientific context. Research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected.'''<ref name="DunbarLuck"/><ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991">Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York:NY, Columbia University Press.</ref>''' This is what professor of economics [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls "Anti-fragility"; while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error, human bias, and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant or tough - it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile). Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.<ref name=Anti-fragility>Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility, http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html</ref>

Psychologist Kevin Dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments. These unexpected results lead researchers to try and fix what they ''think'' is an error in their method. Eventually, the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. The highly controlled, cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors. At this point, the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise.<ref name="DunbarLuck"/><ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/>

There are hints of experimental methods from the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] world (e.g., those reported by [[Archimedes]] in a report recovered early in the 20th century from an [[Archimedes Palimpsest|overwritten manuscript]]), but the first clear instances of an [[experiment]]al scientific method seem to have been developed by [[Islamic science|Islamic scientists]] who introduced the use of [[experiment]]ation and [[quantification]] within a generally empirical orientation. For example, Alhazen performed [[optics|optical]] and physiological experiments, reported in his manifold works, the most famous being ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021).<ref>

By the late 15th century, the physician-scholar [[Niccolò Leoniceno]] was finding errors in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. As a physician, Leoniceno was concerned about these botanical errors propagating to the [[materia medica]] on which medicines were based.<ref>[[Niccolò Leoniceno]] (1509), ''De Plinii et aliorum erroribus liber'' apud Ferrara, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=13}}</ref> To counter this, a botanical garden was established at [[Orto botanico di Padova]], University of Padua (in use for teaching by 1546), in order that medical students might have empirical access to the plants of a pharmacopia. The philosopher and physician [[Francisco Sanches]] was led by his medical training at Rome, 1571–73, and by the philosophical skepticism recently placed in the European mainstream by the publication of [[Sextus Empiricus]]' "Outlines of Pyrrhonism", to search for a true method of knowing (''modus sciendi''), as nothing clear can be known by the methods of Aristotle and his followers<ref>'I have sometimes seen a verbose quibbler attempting to persuade some ignorant person that white was black; to which the latter replied, "I do not understand your reasoning, since I have not studied as much as you have; yet I honestly believe that white differs from black. But pray go on refuting me for just as long as you like." '— {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=276}}</ref> — for example, syllogism fails upon circular reasoning. Following the physician [[Galen]]'s ''method of medicine'', Sanches lists the methods of judgement and experience, which are faulty in the wrong hands,<ref>{{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=278}}.</ref> and we are left with the bleak statement ''That Nothing is Known'' (1581). This challenge was taken up by [[René Descartes]] in the next generation (1637), but at the least, Sanches warns us that we ought to refrain from the methods, summaries, and commentaries on Aristotle, if we seek scientific knowledge. In this, he is echoed by Francis Bacon, also influenced by skepticism; Sanches cites the humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] who sought a better educational system, as well as a statement of human rights as a pathway for improvement of the lot of the poor.

The modern scientific method crystallized no later than in the 17th and 18th centuries. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) — a reference to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' — [[Francis Bacon]] outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old [[philosophy|philosophical]] process of [[syllogism]].<ref>[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential, ..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."
</ref> Then, in 1637, [[René Descartes]] established the framework for scientific method's guiding principles in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]''. The writings of Alhazen, Bacon and Descartes are considered critical in the historical development of the modern scientific method, as are those of [[John Stuart Mill]].<ref name="mill">

{{quote|[[Robert Grosseteste|Grosseteste]] was "the principal figure" in bringing about "a more adequate method of scientific inquiry" by which "medieval scientists were able eventually to outstrip their ancient European and Muslim teachers" (Dales 1973:62). ... His thinking influenced Roger Bacon, who spread Grosseteste's ideas from Oxford to the University of Paris during a visit there in the 1240s. From the prestigious universities in Oxford and Paris, the new experimental science spread rapidly throughout the medieval universities: "And so it went to Galileo, William Gilbert, Francis Bacon, William Harvey, Descartes, Robert Hooke, Newton, Leibniz, and the world of the seventeenth century" (Crombie 1962:15).

In the late 19th century, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] proposed a schema that would turn out to have considerable influence in the development of current scientific methodology generally. Peirce accelerated the progress on several fronts. Firstly, speaking in broader context in [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/ideas/id-frame.htm "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" (1878)], Peirce outlined an objectively verifiable method to test the truth of putative knowledge on a way that goes beyond mere foundational alternatives, focusing upon both ''deduction'' and ''induction''. He thus placed induction and deduction in a complementary rather than competitive context (the latter of which had been the primary trend at least since [[David Hume]], who wrote in the mid-to-late 18th century). Secondly, and of more direct importance to modern method, Peirce put forth the basic schema for hypothesis/testing that continues to prevail today. Extracting the theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic, he refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address the then-current problems in scientific reasoning. Peirce examined and articulated the three fundamental modes of reasoning that, as discussed above in this article, play a role in inquiry today, the processes that are currently known as [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference. Thirdly, he played a major role in the progress of symbolic logic itself — indeed this was his primary specialty.

Beginning in the 1930s, [[Karl Popper]] argued that there is no such thing as inductive reasoning.<ref name=popper2>''Logik der Forschung'', new appendices ''*XVII''–''*XIX'' (not yet available in the English edition ''Logic of scientific discovery'')</ref> All inferences ever made, including in science, are purely<ref>''Logic of Scientific discovery'', p. 20</ref> deductive according to this view. Accordingly, he claimed that the empirical character of science has nothing to do with induction—but with the deductive property of [[falsifiability]] that scientific hypotheses have. Contrasting his views with inductivism and positivism, he even denied the existence of the scientific method: "(1) There is no method of discovering a scientific theory (2) There is no method for ascertaining the truth of a scientific hypothesis, i.e., no method of verification; (3) There is no method for ascertaining whether a hypothesis is 'probable', or probably true".<ref name=popper>Karl Popper: On the non-existence of scientific method. ''Realism and the Aim of Science'' (1983)</ref> Instead, he held that there is only one universal method, a method not particular to science: The negative method of criticism, or colloquially termed [[trial and error]]. It covers not only all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, art and so on, but also the evolution of life. Following Peirce and others, Popper argued that science is fallible and has no authority.<ref name=popper/> In contrast to empiricist-inductivist views, he welcomed metaphysics and philosophical discussion and even gave qualified support to myths<ref>Karl Popper: Science: Conjectures and Refutations. ''Conjectures and Refuations'', section VII</ref> and pseudosciences.<ref>Karl Popper: On knowledge. ''In search of a better world'', section II</ref> Popper's view has become known as [[critical rationalism]].

==Relationship with mathematics==
Science is the process of gathering, comparing, and evaluating proposed models against [[observable]]s. A model can be a simulation, mathematical or chemical formula, or set of proposed steps. Science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines can clearly distinguish what is ''known'' from what is ''unknown'' at each stage of discovery. Models, in both science and mathematics, need to be internally consistent and also ought to be ''[[falsifiable]]'' (capable of disproof). In mathematics, a statement need not yet be proven; at such a stage, that statement would be called a [[conjecture]]. But when a statement has attained mathematical proof, that statement gains a kind of immortality which is highly prized by mathematicians, and for which some mathematicians devote their lives.<ref>
"When we are working intensively, we feel keenly the progress of our work; we are elated when our progress is rapid, we are depressed when it is slow." — the mathematician {{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=131}} in the section on 'Modern [[heuristic]]'.</ref>

Mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other.<ref>
"Philosophy [i.e., physics] is written in this grand book--I mean the universe--which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth." —Galileo Galilei, ''Il Saggiatore'' (''[[The Assayer]]'', 1623), as translated by [[Stillman Drake]] (1957), ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'' pp. 237-8,
as quoted by {{harvnb|di Francia|1981|p=10}}.
</ref> For example, the technical concept of [[time]] arose in [[science]], and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic. But today, the [[Poincaré conjecture]] has been proven using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow (see [[Ricci flow]]).

Nevertheless, the connection between mathematics and reality (and so science to the extent it describes reality) remains obscure. [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper, ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', is a very well known account of the issue from a Nobel Prize physicist. In fact, some observers (including some well known mathematicians such as [[Gregory Chaitin]], and others such as [[Where Mathematics Comes From|Lakoff and Núñez]]) have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation (including cultural ones), somewhat like the post-modernist view of science.

In Pólya's view, ''understanding'' involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words, resorting to geometrical figures, and questioning what we know and do not know already; ''analysis'', which Pólya takes from [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]],<ref>
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=142}}
</ref> involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments, [[working backward from the goal]], and devising a plan for constructing the proof; ''synthesis'' is the strict [[Euclid]]ean exposition of step-by-step details<ref>
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=144}}
</ref> of the proof; ''review'' involves reconsidering and re-examining the result and the path taken to it.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], when asked how he came about his [[theorem]]s, once replied "durch planmässiges Tattonieren" (through [[Constructivism (mathematics)|systematic palpable experimentation]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Mackay|1991}} p.100</ref>

[[Imre Lakatos]] argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction, criticism and revision as principles for improving their work.<ref>See the development, by generations of mathematicians, of [[Euler's formula for polyhedra]] as documented by {{Citation|first=Imre| last=Lakatos|year=1976|title=[[Proofs and refutations]]|authorlink=Imre Lakatos |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-29038-4}}</ref>
