'''Sex reassignment surgery''' (initialized as '''SRS'''; also known as '''gender reassignment surgery (GRS)''', '''genital reconstruction surgery''', '''sex affirmation surgery''', '''sex realignment surgery''' or '''sex-change operation''') is a term for the [[surgical]] procedures by which a person's physical appearance and function of their existing sexual characteristics are altered to resemble that of the other [[sex]]. It is part of a treatment for [[gender identity disorder]]/gender dysphoria in [[transsexual]] and [[transgender]] people. It may also be performed on [[intersex]] people, often in infancy and without their consent. In a recent 
statement by the UN, it condemns the nonconsensual treatment of "normalization" surgery to treat intersexuality.<ref>http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/02/07/un-condemns-normalization-surgery-for-intersexuality/</ref>

Other terms for SRS include ''sex reconstruction surgery,'' ''gender confirmation surgery,'' and more clinical terms, such as ''feminizing genitoplasty'' or ''penectomy, orchidectomy and [[vaginoplasty]]'' are used medically for trans women, with ''masculinizing genitoplasty'' or ''phalloplasty'' often similarly used for trans men.

People who pursue sex reassignment surgery are usually referred to as transsexual; "trans" - across, through, change; "sexual" - pertaining to the sexual [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s  (not sexual actions) of a person. More recently, people pursuing SRS often identify as transgender instead of transsexual.

== Scope and procedures ==
The best known of these surgeries are those that reshape the genitals, which are also known as ''genital reassignment surgery'' or ''genital reconstruction surgery'' (GRS). However, the meaning of "sex reassignment surgery" has been clarified by the medical subspecialty organization, the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]] (WPATH), to include any of a larger number of surgical procedures performed as part of a medical treatment for "gender dysphoria", "transsexualism" or "gender identity disorder". According to WPATH, medically necessary sex reassignment surgeries include "complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation [...] including breast prostheses if necessary, genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient[...])[...] and certain facial plastic reconstruction."<ref>see WPATH "Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S." available at: http://www.wpath.org/documents/Med%20Nec%20on%202008%20Letterhead.pdf</ref> In addition, other non-surgical procedures are also considered medically necessary treatments by WPATH, including facial electrolysis. 

A growing number of public and commercial health insurance plans in the United States now contain defined benefits covering sex reassignment-related procedures, usually including genital reconstruction surgery (MTF and FTM), chest reconstruction (FTM), breast augmentation (MTF), and hysterectomy (FTM).<ref>See discussion of insurance exclusions at: http://www.hrc.org/issues/transgender/9568.htm</ref> In June 2008, the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) House of Delegates stated that the denial to patients with gender identity disorder of otherwise covered benefits represents discrimination, and that the AMA supports "public and private health insurance coverage for treatment for gender identity disorder as recommended by the patient's physician."<ref>AMA Resolution 122 "Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients". see: http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/15/digest_of_actions.pdf</ref> Other organizations have issued similar statements, including WPATH,<ref>See WPATH Clarification Statement</ref> the [[American Psychological Association]],<ref>APA Policy Statement Transgender, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression Non-Discrimination. See online at: http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/transgender.pdf</ref> and the [[National Association of Social Workers]].<ref>NASW Policy Statement on Transgender and Gender Identity Issues, revised August 2008. See www.socialworkers.org</ref>

== Differences between trans women and trans men SRS ==
The array of medically necessary surgeries differs between [[trans women]] (male to female) and [[trans men]] (female to male). For trans women, genital reconstruction usually involves the [[vaginoplasty|surgical construction of a vagina]], whereas in the case of trans men, genital reconstruction may involve construction of a penis through either [[phalloplasty]] or [[metoidioplasty]]. In both cases, for trans women and trans men, genital surgery may also involve other medically necessary ancillary procedures, such as [[orchiectomy]] or [[vaginectomy]]. 

As underscored by WPATH, a medically assisted transition from one sex to another may entail any of a variety of non-genital surgical procedures, any of which are considered "sex reassignment surgery" when performed as part of treatment for transsexualism. For trans men, these may include [[mastectomy]] (removal of the female breasts) and chest reconstruction (the shaping of a male-contoured chest), or [[hysterectomy]] and bilateral [[oophorectomy|salpingo-oophorectomy]]. For some trans women, [[facial feminization surgery]] and [[breast augmentation]] are also medically necessary components of their surgical treatment.

== Medical considerations ==
People with [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]] may have difficulty finding a surgeon able or willing to perform surgery. Many surgeons operate in small private clinics that cannot adequately treat potential complications in these populations. Some surgeons charge higher fees for HIV- and hepatitis C-positive patients; other medical professionals, assert that it is unethical to deny surgical or hormonal treatments to transsexuals solely on the basis of their HIV or hepatitis status.<ref>See WPATH Standards of Care, also WPATH Clarification. www.wpath.org</ref>

Other health conditions such as [[diabetes]], [[blood clotting#Disorders of hemostasis|abnormal blood clotting]], and [[obesity]] do not usually present a problem to experienced surgeons. The conditions do increase the [[anesthetic]] risk and the rate of post-operative [[complication (medicine)|complications]]. Surgeons may require overweight patients to reduce their weight before surgery, any patients to refrain from [[hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement]] before surgery and smoking patients to refrain from [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] before and after surgery. Surgeons commonly stipulate the latter regardless of the type of operation.

Medical advances may eventually make childbearing possible by using a donor [[uterus]] long enough to carry a child to term as [[Immunosuppressive drug|anti-rejection drugs]] do not seem to affect the fetus.<ref>[http://www.saukvalley.com/articles/2007/01/23/features/health_and_medical/288035642038177.txt Doctors plan uterus transplants to help women with removed, damaged wombs have babies] - Associated Press</ref><ref name="Fageeh2002">{{cite journal |author=Fageeh W, Raffa H et al.|title=Transplantation of the human uterus|journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics|month=March | year=2002|volume=76|issue=3|pages=245–51|pmid=11880127 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7292(01)00597-5}}</ref><ref name="Priore2007">{{cite journal |author=Del Priore G, Stega J et al.|title=Human uterus retrieval from a multi-organ donor|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|month=January | year=2007|volume=109|issue=1|pages=101–4|pmid=17197594 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000248535.58004.2f}}</ref><ref name="Nair2008">{{cite journal |author=Nair A, Stega J et al.|title=Uterus Transplant: Evidence and Ethics|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|month=April | year=2008|volume=1127 |issue=1|pages=83–91|pmid=18443334 |doi=10.1196/annals.1434.003}}</ref> The [[DNA]] in a donated [[ovum]] can be removed and replaced with the DNA of the receiver.

== Standards of care ==
{{See also|Legal aspects of transsexualism}}
Sex reassignment surgery can be difficult to obtain, due to a combination of financial barriers and lack of providers. An increasing number of surgeons are now training to perform such surgeries. In many regions, an individual's pursuit of SRS is often governed, or at least guided, by documents called [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People]] (SOC).  The most widespread SOC in this field is published and frequently revised by the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]] (WPATH, formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association or HBIGDA). Many jurisdictions and medical boards in the United States and other countries recognize the WPATH Standards of Care for the treatment of transsexualism.  For many individuals, these may require a minimum duration of [[psychological evaluation]] and living as a member of the target gender full-time, sometimes called the real life experience (RLE) (sometimes mistakenly referred to as the real life test (RLT)) before genital reconstruction or other sex reassignment surgeries are permitted.

Standards of Care usually give certain very specific "minimum" requirements as guidelines for progressing with treatment for transsexualism, including accessing cross-gender hormone replacement or many surgical interventions. For this and many other reasons, both the WPATH-SOC and other SOCs are highly controversial and often maligned documents among transgender patients seeking surgery. Alternative local standards of care exist, such as in the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Much of the criticism surrounding the WPATH/HBIGDA-SOC applies to these as well, and some of these SOCs (mostly European SOC) are actually based on much older versions of the WPATH-SOC.  Other SOCs are entirely independent of the WPATH. The criteria of many of those SOCs are stricter than the latest revision of the WPATH-SOC. Many qualified surgeons in North America and many in Europe adhere almost unswervingly to the WPATH-SOC or other SOCs. However, in the United States many experienced surgeons are able to apply the WPATH SOC in ways which respond to an individual's medical circumstances, as is consistent with the SOC. 

Most surgeons require two letters of recommendation for sex reassignment surgery. At least one of these letters must be from a mental health professional experienced in diagnosing gender identity disorder, that has known the patient for over a year. Letters must state that sex reassignment surgery is the correct course of treatment for the patient.<ref>http://www.wpath.org/documents/SOC%20V7%2003-17-12.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.tssurgeryguide.com/WPATH-standards-of-care.html</ref>

Many medical professionals and numerous professional associations have stated that surgical interventions should not be required in order for transsexual individuals to change sex designation on identity documents.<ref>See WPATH Clarification Statement, APA Policy Statement, and NASW Policy Statement</ref>  However, depending on the legal requirements of many jurisdictions, [[transsexual]] and [[transgender]] people are often unable to change the listing of their sex in public records unless they can furnish a physician's letter attesting that sex reassignment surgery has been performed, in other instances legal gender change is prohibited even after genital or other surgery or treatment without recourse, while in other cases, such statutes may specify that genital surgery has been completed.

== History ==
The earliest identified recipient of male to female sex reassignment surgery was 'Dora-R'.<ref name=Dora-R>Encyclopaedia of Sexual Knowledge by Norman Haire (1930), Encyclopaedic Press, London.[http://www.transgenderzone.com/features/sex_change.htm First Sex Change]</ref> "She took the first step towards changing her sex in 1921, when she had herself castrated... Finally, in 1930, the operation which she herself had attempted at the age of six was performed upon her, that is, the removal of her penis, and six months afterwards the transformation was completed by the grafting of an artificial vagina."

This was followed by [[Lili Elbe]] in Berlin during 1930-1931. She started with the removal of the male sex organs, the operation supervised by Dr. [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. Lili went on to have four more subsequent operations that included an unsuccessful [[uterus|uterine]] [[organ transplant|transplant]], the rejection of which resulted in death.  An earlier known recipient of this was [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]],<ref>[[Magnus Hirschfeld]], ''Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft'', 1908</ref> but her identity is unclear at this time.

The Iranian government's "solution" for homosexuality is to endorse, and fully pay for, sex reassignment surgery.<ref name=SexChange>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2008/08/26/f-homosexuality-iran-sex-change.html Iran's gay plan], Matthew Hays, ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'', August 26, 2008; accessed September 20, 2008.</ref>  The leader of Iran's [[Islamic Revolution]], [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], issued a [[fatwa]] declaring sex reassignment surgery permissible for "diagnosed transsexuals."<ref name="SexChange"/>  Eshaghian's documentary, ''[[Be Like Others]]'', chronicles a number of stories of [[LGBT rights in Iran|Iranian gay men]] who feel transitioning is the only way to avoid further persecution, jail and/or execution.<ref name=SexChange/>  The head of Iran's main transsexual organization, [[Maryam Khatoon Molkara]]—who convinced Khomeini to issue the fatwa on transsexuality—confirmed that some people who undergo operations are gay rather than transsexual.<ref name=Guardian>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,2177277,00.html Sex change funding undermines no gays claim], Robert Tait, ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 26, 2007; accessed September 20, 2008.</ref>

[[Thailand]] is the country that performs the most sex reassignment surgeries, followed by [[Iran]].<ref name=Guardian/>

On June 12, 2003, [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in favor of Van Kück, a German transsexual woman whose insurance company denied her reimbursement for gender reassignment surgery as well as [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]]. The legal arguments related to the [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] as well as the [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]]. This affair is referred to as '''Van Kück vs Germany.'''<ref>[http://www.menschenrechte.ac.at/orig/03_3/Kuck.pdf The Case Van Kück vs. Germany, June 12 2003]</ref>
