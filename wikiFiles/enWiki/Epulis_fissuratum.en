It is a harmless condition and does not represent [[oral cancer]]. Treatment is by simple surgical removal of the lesion, and also by adjustment of the denture or provision of new denture.

==Classification==
[[Epulis]] (literally, 'on the gingiva') is a general term for any [[gingiva]]l or [[alveolus|alveolar]] [[tumor]] (i.e. lump).<ref name="Neville 2002" /> This term describes only the location of a lump and has no implication on the [[histology|histologic]] appearance of a lesion.<ref name="Cawson 2002" /> ''Epulis'' is also sometimes used synonymously with epulis fissuratum,<ref name="Neville 2002" /> however other conditions are classified as epulides, e.g. giant cell epulis ([[peripheral giant cell granuloma]]), ossifying fibroid epulis ([[peripheral ossifying fibroma]]), and [[congenital epulis]].<ref name="Neville 2002" />

==Signs and symptoms==
The lesion is usually painless.<ref name="Scully 2008">{{cite book|last=Scully C|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|page=352|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> The usual appearance is of two excess tissue folds in alveolar vestibule/buccal sulcus, with the flange of the denture fitting in between the two folds.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> It may occur in either the maxillary or mandibular sulci,<ref name="Neville 2002" /> although the latter is more usual.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|Anterior]] locations are more common than [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|posterior]].<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Less commonly there may be a single fold, and the lesion may appear on the lingual surface of the mandibular alveolar ridge.<ref name="Neville 2002" />

The swelling is firm and fibrous, with a smooth, pink surface.<ref name="Neville 2002" /><ref name="Scully 2008" /> The surface may also show [[oral ulceration|ulceration]] or [[erythema]].<ref name="Neville 2002" /> The size of the lesion varies from less than 1 cm to involving the entire length of the sulcus.<ref name="Neville 2002" />

==Causes==
[[File:Epulis.jpg|thumb|right|Fibrous hyperplasia around a dental implant, caused by a broken denture clasp.<ref>Dorfman J, The Center for Special Dentistry. http://www.nycdentist.com/dental-photo-detail/2446/215/Oral-Pathology-Dental-Medicine-diagnosis-treatment-cyst</ref>]] The cause is usually pressure from the flange of a denture which causes chronic irritation and a hyperplastic response in the soft tissues.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Women during pregnancy can also present with an epulis, which will resolve after birth.  [[Fibroepithelial polyp]]s, [[pedunculated]] lesions of the palate beneath an upper denture, are associated with this condition.  An epulis fissuratum in a patient without dentures can also be diagnostic of [[Crohn's disease]].{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}} Epulis fissuratum can also appear around dental implants.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made clinically, and usually this is clear cut if the lesion is associated with the flange of a denture.<ref name="Scully 2008" />  Tissue [[biopsy]] is not usually indicated before removal of the lesion, since the excises surgical specimen is usually sent for [[histopathology|histopathologic]] examination and the diagnosis is confirmed retrospectively. Rarely, incisional biopsy may be indicated to rule out [[neoplasia]], e.g. in the presence of suspicious ulceration. The appearance may also be confused with [[pyogenic granuloma]].<ref name="Neville 2002" />

The excessive tissue is composed of cellular, inflamed fibrous connective tissue. The appearance of an epulis fissuratum microscopically is an overgrowth of [[cell (biology)|cells]] from the fibrous connective tissue.  The [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] are usually hyperkeratotic and irregular, hyperplastic rete ridges are often seen.

==Treatment==
Treatment is by surgical excision (complete removal) of the fibrous tissue overgrowth and addressing the causative factor to prevent recurrence of the lesion.<ref name="Neville 2002" /><ref name="de Arruda Paes-Junior 2011">{{cite journal|last=de Arruda Paes-Junior|first=Tarcisio José|coauthors=Cavalcanti, Sâmia Carolina Mota; Nascimento, Daniela Fernandes Figueira; Anzaloni Saavedra, Guilherme de Siqueira Ferreira; Kimpara, Estevão Tomomitsu; Borges, Alexandre Luiz Souto; Niccoli-Filho, Walter; Komori, Paula Carolina de Paiva|title=CO2 Laser Surgery and Prosthetic Management for the Treatment of Epulis Fissuratum|journal=ISRN Dentistry|date=1 January 2011|volume=2011|pages=1–5|doi=10.5402/2011/282361|pmid=21991461|pmc=3170081}}</ref> Other sources suggest that surgical excision may not be required in all cases.<ref name="Thomas 1993" /> Common techniques for removal of the excess tissue include traditional removal with a surgical [[scalpel]], [[Electrosurgery|electrical scalpel]], or [[Laser surgery|laser excision]] with a [[laser scalpel]], e.g. a [[carbon dioxide laser]], [[erbium:YAG laser]], [[Neodynium-YAG laser]], or [[diode laser]].<ref name="de Arruda Paes-Junior 2011" /> The poorly fitting denture can be adapted to fit better (a "reline") or a new denture constructed.<ref name="Neville 2002" /><ref name="de Arruda Paes-Junior 2011" /> Alternatively, the section of flange that is sharp/over-extended can be smoothed and reduced with a drill.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

==Prognosis==
If the causative factor persists, tissue will become more fibrous over time.<ref name="de Arruda Paes-Junior 2011" />

==Epidemiology==
This condition occurs in association with denture wearing, and so those affected tend to be middle aged or older adults.<!-- <ref name="Neville 2002" /> --> 66-75% are estimated to occur in women.<ref name="Neville 2002" /> Epulis fissuratum is the third most common reactive lesion that occurs in the mouth, after [[peripheral giant cell granuloma]] and [[pyogenic granuloma]]. <ref name="Naderi 2012">{{cite journal|last=Naderi|first=NJ|coauthors=Eshghyar, N; Esfehanian, H|title=Reactive lesions of the oral cavity: A retrospective study on 2068 cases.|journal=Dental research journal|date=2012 May|volume=9|issue=3|pages=251-5|pmid=23087727|pmc=3469888}}</ref>
