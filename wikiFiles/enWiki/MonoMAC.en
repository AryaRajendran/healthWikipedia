The [[autosomal dominant]] syndrome associated with [[monocytopenia]], [[B cell|B]] and [[NK cell]] [[lymphopenia]] and mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections (abbreviated '''MonoMAC''') is a rare [[genetic disorder]] first described by Vihn and colleagues in 2010<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1182/blood-2009-03-208629  |author=Vinh DC, Patel SY, Uzel G, Anderson VL, Freeman AF, Olivier KN, Spalding C,

==Signs and symptoms==
This syndrome is characterized by an increased susceptibility to disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, viral infections, especially with human [[papillomaviruses]], and fungal infections, primarily histoplasmosis, and molds. There is profound monocytopenia, B lymphocytopenia  and NK lymphocytopenia. Patients have an increased chance of developing malignancies, including: [[myelodysplasia]]/[[leukemia]] [[vulvar carcinoma]], [[melanoma|metastatic melanoma]], [[cervical carcinoma]], [[Bowen disease]] of the vulva, and multiple [[Epstein-Barr virus]](+) [[leiomyosarcoma]]. Patients may also develop [[pulmonary alveolar proteinosis]] without mutations in the [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor]] or anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies. Last, patients may develop autoimmune phenomena, including [[lupus]] like syndromes, [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] or aggressive [[multiple sclerosis]].

Of the 25 patients probably afflicted by this syndrome, 48% died of causes ranging from [[cancer]] to [[myelodysplasia]] with a mean age at death of 34.7 years and median age of 36.5 years.

==Genetics==
12 distinct mutations in the GATA2 gene have been identified. They include missense mutations affecting the zinc finger-2 domain and insertion/deletion mutations leading to frameshifts and premature termination.

==Treatment==
There is no FDA approved treatment. Stem cell transplantation is currently under evaluation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00923364 |title=Pilot and Feasibility Study of Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for MonoMAC |author=National Institutes of Health Clinical Center |date=April 2011 |work= |publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref>
