'''Obstetrics''' (from the [[Latin]] ''obstare'', "to stand by") is the medical specialty dealing with the care of all women's reproductive tracts and their children during [[pregnancy]] (prenatal period), [[childbirth]] and the [[postnatal]] period. Many obstetricians are also [[Gynaecology|gynecologists]], meaning they perform in both specialties. In the United States, these physicians are commonly referred to as OB/GYNs.

== History of obstetrics ==
[[File:Eucharius Rößlin Rosgarten Childbirth.jpg|thumb|right|Two midwives assisting a woman in labour on a birth chair in the 16th century, from a work by [[Eucharius Rößlin]].]]

Prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was confined exclusively to women, and rigorously excluded men. The expectant mother would invite close female friends and family members to her home to keep her company.<ref name="Gelis">Gelis, Jacues. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northern University Press, 1991: 96-98</ref> Skilled [[midwives]] managed all aspects of the labour and delivery. The presence of physicians and surgeons was very rare and only occurred once a serious complication had taken place and the midwife had exhausted all measures to manage the complication. Calling a surgeon was very much a last resort and having men deliver women in this era whatsoever was seen as offending female modesty.<ref name="BynumPorter">Bynum, W.F., & Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1050-1051.</ref>

=== 18th century ===
The 18th century marked the beginning of many advances in European midwifery. These advances in knowledge were mainly regarding the physiology of pregnancy and labour. By the end of the century the anatomy of the uterus and the physiological changes that take place during labour began to be understood by medical communities. The introduction of  [[forceps in childbirth]] also took place during the 18th century. All of these medical advances in the knowledge of obstetrics would be the lever for the introduction of men into an arena that had only ever been managed and run by women, midwifery.<ref>Bynum, W.F., & Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1051-1052.</ref>

The addition of the male-midwife is historically a significant change to the profession of obstetrics. In the 18th century medical men began to train in area of [[childbirth]] and believed with their advanced knowledge in anatomy that childbirth could be improved. In France these male-midwives were referred to as "accoucheurs", this title was later on lent to male-midwives all over Europe. The founding of lying-hospitals also contributed to the medicalization and male-dominance of obstetrics. These lying-hospitals were establishments where women would come to have their babies delivered, which had prior been unheard of since the midwife normally came to home of the pregnant woman. This institution provided male-midwives or accoucheurs with an endless number of patients to practice their techniques on and also was a way for these men to demonstrate their knowledge.<ref>Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, “Obstetrics and Midwifery.”   accessed May 21, 2012, http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Me-Pa/Obstetrics-and-  Midwifery.html</ref>

Many midwives of the time bitterly opposed the involvement of men in childbirth. Some male practitioners also opposed the involvement of medical men like themselves in midwifery, and even went as far as to say that men-midwives only undertook midwifery solely for perverse erotic satisfaction. The accoucheurs argued that their involvement in midwifery was to improve the process of childbirth. These men also believed that obstetrics would forge ahead and continue to strengthen.<ref name="BynumPorter"/>

=== 19th century ===
Even though it was expected in the 18th century that obstetrics would continue to grow, the opposite showed to be true. Obstetrics entered a stage of stagnation in the 19th century, until about the 1880s.<ref name="Gelis"/> The central explanation for the lack of advancement during this time was substantially due to the rejection of obstetrics by the medical community. The 19th century marked an era of medical reform in Europe and increased regulation over the medical profession. Major European institutions such as The College of Physicians and Surgeons considered delivering babies ungentlemanly work and refused to have anything to do with childbirth as a whole. Even when [[Medical Act 1858]] was introduced, which stated that medical students could qualify as doctors, midwifery was entirely ignored. This made it nearly impossible to pursue an education in midwifery and also have the recognition of being a doctor or surgeon. Obstetrics was pushed to the side.<ref>Bynum, W.F., & Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1053-1055.</ref>

By the late 19th century the foundation of modern day obstetrics and midwifery began to be laid. The delivery of babies by doctors became popular and readily accepted but midwives also continued to play a role in childbirth. Midwifery also changed during this era due to increased regulation and the eventual need for midwives to become certified. Many European countries by the late 19th century were monitoring the training of midwives and issued certification based on competency. Midwives were no longer uneducated in the formal sense.<ref name="Drife">Drife, J., “The start of life: a history of obstetrics,” Postgraduate Medical Journal 78 (2002):  311-315, accessed May 21, 2012. doi: 10.1136/pmj.78.919.311.</ref>

As midwifery began to develop so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But the specialty was still behind in its development stages in comparison to other medical specialities, and remained a generality in this era. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in [[asepsis]] and [[anesthesia]] which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the [[Caesarean Section]].<ref name="Drife"/><ref>Low, James.,  “Caesarean section-past and present,” Journal of obstetrics and gynecology  canada  31, no. 12 (2009): 1131-1136, accessed May 20, 2012. http://www.sogc.org/jogc/abstracts/full/200912_Obstetrics_2.pdf</ref>

Before the 1880s mortality rates in lying-hospitals would reach unacceptably high levels and became an area of public concern. Much of these maternal deaths were due to [[Puerperal fever]], at the time commonly known as childbed fever. In the 1800s Dr. [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth by physicians in lying-hospitals. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an [[antiseptic]] solution before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.med.mcgill.ca/mjm/issues/v01n01/fever.html | title=The Childbed Fever Mystery and the Meaning of Medical Journalism | last=Caplan| first=Caralee E. | journal=McGill Journal of Medicine | year=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1}}</ref> So it was concluded that it was physicians who had been spreading disease from one laboring mother to the next. Despite the publication of this information, doctors still would not wash and disregarded the theory. It was not until the 20th century when these advancements in aseptic technique and the understanding of disease would play a significant role in the decrease of [[maternal mortality]] rates among many populations.

== Prenatal care ==
{{Prose|date=March 2009}}
{{Main|Prenatal care}}
Prenatal care is important in screening for various complications of pregnancy. This includes routine office visits with physical exams and routine lab tests:

Image:Sucking his thumb and waving.jpg|Fetus at 17 weeks
Image:3dultrasound 20 weeks.jpg|Fetus at 20 weeks
</gallery></center>

=== First trimester ===
* [[Complete blood count]] (CBC)
* [[Blood type]]
* General [[antibody]] screen ([[Coombs test#Indirect Coombs test|indirect Coombs test]]) for [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn|HDN]]
** Rh D negative antenatal patients should receive RhoGam at 28 weeks to prevent Rh disease.
* [[Rapid plasma reagin]] (RPR) to screen for [[syphilis]]
* [[Rubella]] antibody screen
* [[Hepatitis B]] surface antigen
* [[Gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]] culture
* [[Mantoux test|PPD]] for [[tuberculosis]]
* [[Pap smear]]
* [[Urinalysis]] and culture
* [[HIV]] screen
* [[Group B Streptococcus]] screen &ndash; will receive IV penicillin or ampicillin (it is much cheaper and has a wider coverage)if positive (if mother is allergic, alternative therapies include IV clindamycin or IV vancomycin)
genetic screening for downs syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18
the national standard in the United States is rapidly evolving away from the AFP-Quad screen for downs syndrome- done typically in the second trimester at 16–18 weeks. The newer integrated screen (formerly called F.A.S.T.E.R for First And Second Trimester Early Results) can be done at 10 plus weeks to 13 plus weeks with an ultrasound of the fetal neck (thick skin is bad) and two chemicals (analytes) Papp-a and bhcg (pregnancy hormone level itself). It gives an accurate risk profile very early. There is a second blood screen at 15 to 20 weeks which refines the risk more accurately. The cost is higher than an "AFP-quad" screen due to the ultrasound and second blood test but it is quoted to have a 93% pick up rate as opposed to 88% for the standard AFP/QS. This is an evolving standard of care in the United States.

=== Second trimester ===
* MSAFP/quad. screen (four simultaneous blood tests) (maternal serum [[alpha-fetoprotein; inhibin; estriol; bhcg or free bhcg]]) - elevations, low numbers or odd patterns correlate with neural tube defect risk and increased risks of trisomy 18 or trisomy 21
* Ultrasound either abdominal or trannsvaginal to assess cervix, placenta, fluid and baby
* Amniocentesis is the national standard (in what country) for women over 35 or who reach 35 by mid pregnancy or who are at increased risk by family history or prior birth history.

=== Third trimester ===
* Hematocrit (if low, mother will receive iron supplementation)
* Glucose loading test (GLT) - screens for gestational diabetes; if > 140&nbsp;mg/dL, a [[glucose tolerance test]] (GTT) is administered; a fasting glucose > 105&nbsp;mg/dL suggests gestational diabetes.
Most doctors do a sugar load in a drink form of 50&nbsp;grams of glucose in cola, lime or orange and draw blood an hour later (plus or minus 5 minutes) ; the standard modified criteria have been lowered to 135 since the late 1980s

===Antenatal record===
On the first visit to her [[obstetrician]] or [[midwife]], the pregnant woman is asked to carry out the antenatal record, which constitutes a [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]]. On subsequent visits, the [[gestational age]] (GA) is rechecked with each visit.

[[Symphysis-fundal height]] (SFH; in cm) should equal gestational age after 20 weeks of gestation, and the fetal growth should be plotted on a curve during the antenatal visits. The fetus is palpated by the midwife or obstetrician using [[Leopold maneuver]] to determine the position of the baby. [[Blood pressure]] should also be monitored, and may be up to 140/90 in normal pregnancies. High blood pressure indicates [[hypertension]] and possibly [[pre-eclampsia]], if severe swelling ([[edema]]) and spilled protein in the urine are also present.

[[Fetal screening]] is also used to help assess the viability of the fetus, as well as congenital problems. [[Genetic counseling]] is often offered for families who may be at an increased risk to have a child with a genetic condition.
[[Amniocentesis]], which is usually performed between 15 and 20 weeks,<ref>http://www.medicinenet.com/amniocentesis/article.htm</ref> to check for [[Down syndrome]], other [[chromosome]] abnormalities or other conditions in the fetus, is sometimes offered to women who are at increased risk due to factors such as older age, previous affected pregnancies or family history.

Even earlier than amniocentesis is performed, the mother may undergo the [[triple test]], [[nuchal translucency|nuchal screening]], [[nasal bone]], [[alpha-fetoprotein]] screening and [[Chorionic villus sampling]], also to check for disorders such as Down Syndrome. Amniocentesis is a prenatal genetic screening of the fetus, which involves inserting a needle through the mother's abdominal wall and uterine wall, to extract fetal DNA from the amniotic fluid. There is a risk of miscarriage and fetal injury with amniocentesis because it involves penetrating the uterus with the baby still in utero.

===Imaging===
[[Image:Scan12weeks.jpg|thumb|A dating [[Obstetric ultrasonography|scan]] at 12 weeks.]]

Imaging is another important way to monitor a pregnancy. The mother and [[fetus]] are also usually imaged in the first trimester of pregnancy. This is done to predict problems with the mother; confirm that a pregnancy is present inside the [[uterus]]; estimate the [[gestational age]]; determine the number of fetuses and [[placenta]]e; evaluate for an [[ectopic pregnancy]] and first trimester bleeding; and assess for early signs of anomalies.

[[X-ray]]s and [[computerized tomography]] (CT) are not used, especially in the first trimester, due to the [[ionizing radiation]], which has [[teratogen]]ic effects on the fetus. No effects of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) on the fetus have been demonstrated,<ref>

</ref> but this technique is too expensive for routine observation. Instead, [[obstetric ultrasonography]] is the imaging method of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no [[radiation]], is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.

Ultrasound imaging may be done at any time throughout the pregnancy, but usually happens at the 12th week (dating scan) and the 20th week (detailed scan).

A normal gestation would reveal a [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]]. The [[gestational age]] can be assessed by evaluating the [[mean gestational sac diameter]] (MGD) before week 6, and the crown-rump length after week 6. [[Multiple gestation]] is evaluated by the number of [[placenta]]e and [[amniotic sac]]s present.

=== Fetal assessments ===
[[Obstetric ultrasonography]] is routinely used for dating the gestational age of a pregnancy from the size of the fetus, the most accurate dating being in first trimester before the growth of the fetus has been significantly influenced by other factors. Ultrasound is also used for detecting congenital anomalies (or other fetal anomalies) and determining the [[biophysical profile]]s (BPP), which are generally easier to detect in the second trimester when the fetal structures are larger and more developed. Specialised ultrasound equipment can also evaluate the blood flow velocity in the [[umbilical cord]], looking to detect a decrease/absence/reversal or diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery.

Other tools used for assessment include:
*Fetal [[karyotype]] can be used for the screening of genetic diseases. This can be obtained via [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS)
* Fetal [[hematocrit]] for the assessment of fetal [[anemia]], Rh isoimmunization, or [[hydrops fetalis|hydrops]] can be determined by [[percutaneous umbilical blood sampling]] (PUBS) which is done by placing a needle through the abdomen into the [[uterus]] and taking a portion of the [[umbilical cord]].
* Fetal lung maturity is associated with how much [[surfactant]] the fetus is producing. Reduced production of surfactant indicates decreased lung maturity and is a high risk factor for [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]]. Typically a [[lecithin]]:[[sphingomyelin]] ratio greater than 1.5 is associated with increased lung maturity.
* [[Nonstress test]] (NST) for fetal heart rate
* [[Oxytocin challenge test]]

=== Complications and emergencies ===
{{Prose|section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main|Complications of Pregnancy}}

The main emergencies include:

* [[Ectopic pregnancy]] is when an embryo implants in the Fallopian tube or (rarely) on the ovary or inside the peritoneal cavity. This may cause massive internal bleeding.
* [[Pre-eclampsia]] is a disease which is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms that are related to maternal hypertension. The cause is unknown, and markers are being sought to predict its development from the earliest stages of pregnancy. Some unknown factors cause vascular damage in the [[endothelium]], causing [[hypertension]]. If severe, it progresses to ''[[eclampsia]]'', where a convulsions occur, which can be fatal. Preeclamptic patients with the [[HELLP syndrome]] show liver failure and [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).
* [[Placental abruption]] where the patient can bleed to death if not managed appropriately.
* [[Fetal distress]] where the [[fetus]] is getting compromised in the uterine environment.
* [[Shoulder dystocia]] where one of the fetus' shoulders becomes stuck during vaginal birth, especially in macrosomic babies of diabetic mothers.
* [[Uterine rupture]] can occur during obstructed labor and endangered fetal and maternal life.
* [[Prolapsed cord]] refers to the prolapse of the fetal cord during labor with the risk of fetal suffocation.
* [[Obstetrical hemorrhage]] may be due to a number of factors such as [[placenta previa]], uterine rupture or tears, [[uterine atony]], [[retained placenta]] or placental fragments, or bleeding disorders.
* [[Puerperal sepsis]] is a progressed infection of the uterus during or after labor.

==Childbirth==

=== Induction ===
{{Main|Induction (birth)}}

Induction is a method of artificially or prematurely stimulating labour in a woman. Reasons to induce can include [[pre-eclampsia]], placental malfunction, intrauterine growth retardation,<ref>Wagner, Marsden. ''Born in the USA: How a Broken Maternity System Must Be Fixed to Put Women and Children First.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006. Print.</ref> and other various general medical conditions, such as [[renal disease]]. Induction may occur any time after 34 weeks of gestation if the risk to the fetus or mother is greater than the risk of delivering a premature fetus regardless of lung maturity.

Induction may be achieved via several methods:
* [[Pessary]] of ''Prostin'' cream, [[prostaglandin]] E<sub>2</sub>
* Intravaginal or oral administration of [[misoprostol]]
* Cervical insertion of a 30-mL [[Foley catheter]]
* Rupturing the amniotic membranes
* Intravenous infusion of synthetic [[oxytocin]] (Pitocin or Syntocinon)

=== Labor ===
{{Main|Childbirth}}
During labor itself, the obstetrician may be called on to do a number of tasks. These tasks can include:
* Monitor the progress of labor, by reviewing the nursing chart, performing vaginal examination, and assessing the trace produced by a fetal monitoring device (the [[cardiotocograph]])
* Accelerate the progress of labor by infusion of the hormone [[oxytocin]]
* Provide pain relief, either by [[nitrous oxide]], [[opiates]], or by [[local anesthesia|epidural anesthesia]] done by [[anesthesiology|anaesthestists]], an anesthesiologist, or a [[nurse anesthetist]].
* Surgically assisting labor, by [[forceps]] or the [[Ventouse]] (a suction cap applied to the fetus' head)
* [[Caesarean section]], if there is an associated risk with vaginal delivery, as such fetal or maternal compromise supported by evidence and literature. Caesarean section can either be elective, that is, arranged before labor, or decided during labor as an alternative to hours of waiting. True "emergency" Cesarean sections include abruptio placenta, and are more common in multigravid patients, or patients attempting a Vaginal Birth After Caeserean section (VBAC).

==Postnatal care==
{{Further|Postnatal}}
[[Postnatal]] care is care provided to the mother following parturition.

A woman in the Western world who is delivering in a [[hospital]] may leave the hospital as soon as she is medically stable and chooses to leave, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for [[spontaneous vaginal delivery]] (SVD) is 1–2 days, and the average [[caesarean section]] postnatal stay is 3–4 days.

During this time the mother is monitored for [[bleeding]], [[bowel]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] function, and baby care.   The [[infant]]'s health is also monitored.<ref>"With Women, Midwives Experiences: from Shiftwork to Continuity of Care'', David Vernon, Australian College of Midwives, Canberra, 2007 ISBN 978-0-9751674-5-8, p17f</ref>

Certain things must be kept in mind as the physician proceeds with the post-natal care.
# General Condition of the patient.
# Check for Vital Signs (Pulse, Blood Pressure, Temperature, Respiratory Rate, (Pain) at times)
# Palor?
# Edema?
# Dehydration?
# Fundus (height following parturition, and the feel of the fundus) (Per Abdominal Examination)
# If an Episiotomy or a C-Section was performed, check for the dressing. Intact, pus, oozing, haematomas?
# Lochia (colour, amount, odour)?
# Bladder (keep the patient catheterized for 12 hours following local anaesthesia and 24–48 hours after general anaesthesia) ? (check for bladder function)
# Bowel Movements?
# More bowel movements?
# Follow up with the neonate to check if they are healthy.

==Surgery==
The main surgical procedure performed in obstetrics is [[Cesarean section]]. However, ''obstetric surgery'' can potentially also include [[fetal surgery]].

==Salary==
The salary of an obstetrician varies by country. In the United States, the salary ranges from $200,000 to $339,738.
