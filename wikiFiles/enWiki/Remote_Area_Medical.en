According to Brock, local licensing requirements for doctors in many states prevent his group from bringing out-of-state doctors to areas where their help is needed. Tennessee is the only state that has an "Open Borders To Doctors" law on its books.<ref name="DN!"/><ref>{{cite interview|last= Brock |first= Stan |subject= Stan Brock |subjectlink= Stan Brock (philanthropist) |interviewer= [[Tavis Smiley]] |title= Stan Brock |url= http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200908/20090821.html |callsign= [[KCET]] |city= Los Angeles |date= 2009-08-21 |accessdate= 2009-08-22 }}</ref>

Special exemptions have enabled RAM to hold a few clinics outside the state of Tennessee. One of these &mdash; in [[Wise, Virginia]] &mdash; was the largest RAM clinic held to date.<ref>[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/news/archives08/ram_08.cfm RAM 2008, University of Virginia Health Systems]</ref><ref>[http://www.roanoke.com/multimedia/video/wb/170981 Remote Area Medical Expedition in Wise, County], [[The Roanoke Times]]</ref> Held from July 25–27 in 2008, this 3-day clinic had 1,584 volunteers who provided 5,475 treatments to 2,670 patients.
