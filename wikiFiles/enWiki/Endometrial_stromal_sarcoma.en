'''Endometrial stromal sarcoma''' is a rare endometrial tumor arising from the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] (connective tissue) of the [[endometrium]] rather than the glands. There are three grades for endometrial stromal tumors, as follows.<ref>Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 5th edition, p. 2242-2245.</ref> It was previously known as ''endolymphatic stromal myosis'' because of diffuse infiltration of [[myometrium|myometrial]] tissue or the invasion of lymphatic channels.<ref>Kumar V, Abbas A, Fausto N, Aster J (2010).

== Endometrial stromal nodule ==
[[Image:EndometrialStromalNodule.JPG|thumbnail|right|Endometrial Stromal Nodule]]
An endometrial stromal nodule is a noninfiltrative, circumscribed proliferation of endometrial [[stromal cells]]. The appearance of the cells is identical to normal stromal cells. This can only be differentiated from low-grade sarcoma by confirming lack of infiltration.

The differential includes cellular [[leiomyoma]]. Diagnosis may be aided by immunostaining; endometrial stromal nodules are positive for [[CD10]]; leiomyomas are positive for [[caldesmon]] and [[desmin]] (and sometimes CD10).

==Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma==
Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma consists of cells resembling normal proliferative phase endometrium, but with infiltration or [[vascular invasion]]. These behave more aggressively, sometimes metastasizing, with cancer stage the best predictor of survival. The cells express estrogen/progesterone-receptors.

==Undifferentiated uterine sarcoma==
[[Image:EndometrialStromalSarcoma.JPG|thumbnail|right|Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma, High-Grade]]
Undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, or undifferentiated (high-grade) endometrial stromal sarcoma, does not resemble normal endometrial stroma and behaves much more aggressively, frequently metastasizing. The differential includes [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], high-grade [[carcinoma]], [[carcinosarcoma]], and differentiated pure [[sarcomas]].

==Cytologic and genetic features==
A recurrent [[chromosomal translocation]], t(7;17)(p15;q21), occurs in endometrial stromal sarcoma. This translocation leads to the fusion of two [[Polycomb-group proteins|polycomb]] group genes, [[JAZF1]] and JJAZ1, with production of a fusion transcript with anti-apoptotic properties. Interestingly, even normal endometrial stroma cells express the fusion gene, derived not by translocation, but by the "stitching" together of [[Messenger RNA|m-RNAs]]. Thus, it appears that a pro-survival gene in the normal endometrium is somehow subverted to become pro-neoplastic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li H et al |title=Gene fusion and RNA trans-splicing in normal and neoplastic cells |journal=Cell Cycle |year=2009}}</ref>
