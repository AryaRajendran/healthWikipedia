'''Central serous retinopathy''' ('''CSR'''), also known as '''central serous chorioretinopathy''' ('''CSC'''), is an [[eye disease]] which causes [[visual impairment]], often temporary, usually in one eye, mostly affecting males in the age group 20 to 50 but which may also affect women.<ref name="pmid17662099">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.00889.x |title=Central serous chorioretinopathy |year=2008 |last1=Wang |first1=Maria |last2=Munch |first2=Inger Christine |last3=Hasler |first3=Pascal W. |last4=Prünte |first4=Christian |last5=Larsen |first5=Michael |journal=Acta Ophthalmologica |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=126–45 |pmid=17662099}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8628563 |year=1996 |last1=Quillen |first1=DA |last2=Gass |first2=DM |last3=Brod |first3=RD |last4=Gardner |first4=TW |last5=Blankenship |first5=GW |last6=Gottlieb |first6=JL |title=Central serous chorioretinopathy in women |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=72–9 |journal=Ophthalmology}}</ref> When the disorder is active it is characterized by leakage of fluid under the retina that has a propensity to accumulate under the central macula. This results in blurred or [[distorted vision]] ([[metamorphopsia]]). A blurred or gray spot in the central visual field is common when the retina is detached. Reduced [[visual acuity]] may persist after the fluid has disappeared.<ref name="pmid17662099" />

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis usually starts with a dilated examination of the retina, followed with confirmation by [[optical coherence tomography]] and [[fluorescein angiography]]. The angiography test will usually show one or more fluorescent spots with fluid leakage. In 10%-15% of the cases these will appear in a "classic" smoke stack shape. [[Indocyanine green]] angiography can be used to assess the health of the retina in the affected area which can be useful in making a treatment decision. An [[Amsler grid]] could be useful in documenting the precise area of the [[visual field]] involved.

==Causes==
CSR is a fluid detachment of [[macula]] layers from their supporting tissue. This allows [[choroid]]al fluid to leak into the subretinal space. The build-up of fluid seems to occur because of small breaks in the [[retinal pigment epithelium]].

CSR is sometimes called ''[[idiopathic]] CSR'' which means that its cause is unknown. Nevertheless, [[stress (medicine)|stress]] appears to play an important role. An oft-cited but potentially inaccurate conclusion is that persons in stressful occupations, such as airplane pilots, have a higher incidence of CSR.

CSR has also been associated with [[cortisol]] and [[Corticosteroid#Uses of corticosteroids|corticosteroids]].  Persons with CSR have higher levels of cortisol.<ref name="pmid9505819">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjo.81.11.962 |title=Endogenous cortisol profile in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy |year=1997 |last1=Garg |first1=S P |last2=Dada |first2=T. |last3=Talwar |first3=D. |last4=Biswas |first4=N R |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=81 |issue=11 |pages=962–4 |pmid=9505819 |pmc=1722041}}</ref> Cortisol is a [[hormone]] secreted by the [[adrenal cortex]] which allows the body to deal with stress, which may explain the CSR-stress association. There is extensive evidence to the effect that [[corticosteroids]] (e.g. [[cortisone]]) — commonly used to treat inflammations, allergies, skin conditions and even certain eye conditions — can trigger CSR, aggravate it and cause relapses.<ref name="pmid16207106">{{cite journal |doi=10.1592/phco.2005.25.8.1141 |title=Central Serous Chorioretinopathy After Epidural Steroid Injection |year=2005 |last1=Pizzimenti |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Daniel |first2=Karen P. |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1141–6 |pmid=16207106}}</ref><ref name="pmid16033370">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2005.01017.x |title=Visual loss due to central serous chorioretinopathy during corticosteroid treatment for giant cell arteritis |year=2005 |last1=Bevis |first1=Timothy |last2=Ratnakaram |first2=Ramakrishna |last3=Smith |first3=M Fran |last4=Bhatti |first4=M Tariq |journal=Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=437–9 |pmid=16033370}}</ref><ref name="pmid15852168">{{cite journal |doi=10.4321/S0365-66912005000400010 |title=Coroidopatía serosa central como complicación de epitelitis en tratamiento con corticoides |trans_title=Central serous chorioretinopathy as a complication of epitheliopathy under treatment with glucocorticoids |language=Spanish |year=2005 |last1=Fernández Hortelano |first1=A |last2=Sádaba |first2=LM |last3=Heras Mulero |first3=H |last4=García Layana |first4=A |journal=Archivos de la Sociedad Española de Oftalmología |volume=80 |issue=4 |pmid=15852168 |pages=255–8}}</ref> A study of 60 persons with [[Cushing's syndrome]] found CSR in 3 (5%).<ref name="pmid8363466">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archopht.1993.01090090081024 |title=Central Serous Chorioretinopathy in Endogenous Hypercortisolism |year=1993 |last1=Bouzas |first1=Evrydiki A. |journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |volume=111 |issue=9 |pages=1229–33 |pmid=8363466 |last2=Scott |first2=MH |last3=Mastorakos |first3=G |last4=Chrousos |first4=GP |last5=Kaiser-Kupfer |first5=MI}}</ref> Cushing's syndrome is characterized by very high cortisol levels.

Recently found evidence has also implicated [[Helicobacter pylori]]
(see [[gastritis]]) as playing a role.<ref name="pmid15288381">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.02.020 |title=Association of Helicobacter pylori with central serous chorioretinopathy: Hypotheses regarding pathogenesis |year=2004 |last1=Giusti |first1=Cristiano |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=524–7 |pmid=15288381}}</ref><ref name="pmid15687922">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0181-5512(04)96281-X |title=Prévalence de l'Helicobacter pylori dans la choriorétinopathie séreuse centrale et l'épithéliopathie rétinienne diffuse |trans_title=Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in central serous chorioretinopathy and diffuse retinal epitheliopathy: a complementary study |language=French |year=2004 |last1=Ahnoux-Zabsonre |first1=A. |last2=Quaranta |first2=M. |last3=Mauget-Faÿsse |first3=M. |journal=Journal Français d'Ophtalmologie |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1129–33 |pmid=15687922}}</ref><ref name="pmid16703546">{{cite journal |pmid=16703546 |year=2006 |last1=Cotticelli |first1=L |last2=Borrelli |first2=M |last3=d'Alessio |first3=AC |last4=Menzione |first4=M |last5=Villani |first5=A |last6=Piccolo |first6=G |last7=Montella |first7=F |last8=Iovene |first8=MR |last9=Romano |first9=M |title=Central serous chorioretinopathy and Helicobacter pylori |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=274–8 |journal=European journal of ophthalmology}}</ref> It would appear that the presence of the bacteria is well correlated with [[visual acuity]] and other retinal findings following an attack.

Recent evidence also shows that sufferers of [[MPGN]] Type II kidney disease can develop retinal abnormalities including CSR caused by deposits of the same material that originally damaged the [[glomerular basement membrane]] in the kidneys.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0272-6386(03)00665-6 |title=Visual impairment caused by retinal abnormalities in mesangiocapillary (membranoproliferative) glomerulonephritis type II ('dense deposit disease') |year=2003 |last1=Colville |first1=Deb |last2=Guymer |first2=Robyn |last3=Sinclair |first3=Roger A |last4=Savige |first4=Judy |journal=American Journal of Kidney Diseases |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=E2–5 |pmid=12900843}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for CSR is generally excellent.<ref name="pmid17662099" /> Whilst immediate vision loss may be as poor as 20/200, clinically over 90% of patients regain 20/30 vision or better within 6 months. 

Once the fluid has resolved, by itself or through treatment, visual acuity should continue to improve and distortion should reduce as the eye heals.  However, some visual abnormalities can remain even if [[visual acuity]] is measured at 20/20, and lasting problems include decreased [[night vision]],
reduced color discrimination, and localized distortion caused by [[scar]]ring of the [[Retinal_layers#Anatomy_of_vertebrate_retina|sub-retinal layers]].<ref name="pmid16033348">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2005.01027.x |title=Long-term macular function in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy |year=2005 |last1=Baran |first1=Nergis V |last2=Gurlu |first2=Vuslat P |last3=Esgin |first3=Haluk |journal=Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=369–72 |pmid=16033348}}</ref> 

Complications include [[Choroidal neovascularization|subretinal neovascularization]] and
pigment epitheliopathy.<ref name="pmid12161989">{{cite journal |pmid=12161989 |year=2002 |last1=Kanyange |first1=ML |last2=De Laey |first2=JJ |title=Long-term follow-up of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) |issue=284 |pages=39–44 |journal=Bulletin de la Societe belge d'ophtalmologie}}</ref>

The disease can re-occur causing progressive vision loss.

There is also a chronic form, titled as Type II Central Serous Retinopathy, this occurs in approximately 5% of cases.  This exhibits diffuse rather than focalized abnormality of the pigment epithelium, producing a persistent subretinal fluid.  The serous fluid in these cases tends to be shallow rather than dome shaped.  Prognosis for this condition is less favorable and continued [[Doctor-patient relationship|clinical consultation]] is advised.

==Treatment==
Differential diagnosis should be immediately performed to rule out [[retinal detachment]], which is a medical emergency. Additionally, a clinical record should be taken to keep a timeline of the detachment.

Most eyes with CSR undergo spontaneous resorption of subretinal fluid within 3-4 months, recovery of visual acuity usually follows. Any ongoing corticosteroid treatment should be tapered and stopped, where possible.  It is important to check current medication, including nasal sprays and creams, for ingredients of [[corticosteroids]], if found seek advice from a medical practitioner for an alternative. 

Patients sometimes present with an obvious history of psychosocial stress, in which case counselling and expectancy is relevant.

Treatment should be considered if it does not disappear within 3-4 months,<ref name=Boscia2010/> spontaneously or as the result of counselling.<ref name="pmid17662099"/> 

[[Laser photocoagulation]], which effectively burns the leak area shut, may be considered in cases where there is little improvement in a 3 to 4 month duration, and the leakage is confined to a single or a few sources of leakage at a safe distance from the [[fovea]]. However, for many cases the leak is very near the central macula, where photocoagulation would leave a blind spot or the leakage is widespread and its source is difficult to identify. Foveal attenuation has been associated with more than 4 months' duration of symptoms, however a better long-term outcome has not been demonstrated with laser photocoagulation than without photocoagulation.<ref name="pmid17662099" /> Laser photocoagulation can permanently damage vision where applied. Carefully tuned lasers can limit this damage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archopht.117.8.1028 |title=Retinal Sparing by Selective Retinal Pigment Epithelial Photocoagulation |year=1999 |last1=Roider |first1=Johann |journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |volume=117 |issue=8 |pages=1028–34 |pmid=10448745 |last2=Brinkmann |first2=R |last3=Wirbelauer |first3=C |last4=Laqua |first4=H |last5=Birngruber |first5=R}}</ref> Even so laser photocoagulation is not a preferred treatment for leaks in the central vision and is considered an outdated treatment by some doctors.<ref name=Boscia2010>{{cite journal |title=When to Treat and Not to Treat Patients With Central Serous Retinopathy |journal=Retina Today |first=Francesco |last=Boscia |year=2010 |month=April |url=http://bmctoday.net/retinatoday/2010/04/article.asp?f=when-to-treat-and-not-to-treat-patients-with-central-serous-retinopathy}}</ref>

In chronic case Transpupillary thermotherapy has been suggested as an alternative to laser photocoagulation where the leak is in the central macula.<ref name="pmid16238041">{{cite journal |pmid=16238041 |year=2005 |last1=Wei |first1=SY |last2=Yang |first2=CM |title=Transpupillary thermotherapy in the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=412–5 |journal=Ophthalmic surgery, lasers & imaging}}</ref>

[[Photodynamic therapy]] (PDT) with [[verteporfin]] has been shown promise as an effective treatment with minimal complications.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2005.06.026 |title=Photodynamic Therapy for Focal Retinal Pigment Epithelial Leaks Secondary to Central Serous Chorioretinopathy |year=2005 |last1=Ober |first1=Michael D. |last2=Yannuzzi |first2=Lawrence A. |last3=Do |first3=Diana V. |last4=Spaide |first4=Richard F. |last5=Bressler |first5=Neil M. |last6=Jampol |first6=Lee M. |last7=Angelilli |first7=Allison |last8=Eandi |first8=Chiara M. |last9=Lyon |first9=Alice T. |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=112 |issue=12 |pages=2088–94 |pmid=16325707}}</ref> Follow up studies have confirmed the treatment's long-term effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.04.014 |title=Half-Dose Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy for Acute Central Serous Chorioretinopathy |year=2008 |last1=Chan |first1=Wai-Man |last2=Lai |first2=Timothy Y.Y. |last3=Lai |first3=Ricky Y.K. |last4=Liu |first4=David T.L. |last5=Lam |first5=Dennis S.C. |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=115 |issue=10 |pages=1756–65 |pmid=18538401}}</ref> Indocyanine green angiography can be used to predict how the patient will respond to PDT.<ref name=Boscia2010/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2009.10.011 |title=Association Between the Efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy and Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy |year=2010 |last1=Inoue |first1=Ryo |last2=Sawa |first2=Miki |last3=Tsujikawa |first3=Motokazu |last4=Gomi |first4=Fumi |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=441–6.e1–2 |pmid=20172070}}</ref>
