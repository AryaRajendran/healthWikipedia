(1989) Growing Young N.Y.: McGraw Hill pp. 40</ref> There are various factors influencing whether someone has epicanthic folds, including geographical ancestry, age, and certain medical conditions.

==Factors==

===Geographic distribution===
[[File:Namibian Bushmen Girls.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Namibia]]n Bushmen Girls. Epicanthic folds are common among bushmen groups in Southern Africa]]
[[File:Jens Byggmark Schladming 2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Sami people|Sami]] person ([[Jens Byggmark]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samer.se/2063 |title=VM med samer i centrum |publisher=www.samer.se |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> with epicanthic fold]]
Epicanthic fold is typical in many peoples of [[Eastern Asia]]<ref name="epicanthic"/> and is common among [[Central Asian]] populations. Epicanthic folds are characteristic of [[Bushmen]] populations in [[Southern Africa]]. It is also found in significant numbers among [[Indigenous Americans]] and [[Inuit]]s.<ref>Montagu, A. (1989). Growing Young. Bergin & Garvey: CT.</ref><ref name=askd>{{cite web|title=Epicanthus|url=http://epicanthus.askdefine.com/|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=epicanthic fold (anatomy)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189688/epicanthic-fold|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref>
Additionally, European ethnic groups that tend to have epicanthus relatively frequently are [[Sami people|Sami]]s,<ref name="askd"/>. They are most prominent in women and children and tend to become less distinct with age.
People of [[Afro-Asian]] (mixed-race) can also inherit epicanthic folds from their Asian descendants and some full-blooded [[Africans]] are known to have them.

===Age===
Humans initially develop epicanthic fold in the womb. Some [[fetus]]es lose their epicanthic folds after three to six months of gestation or before birth. In other young children it is visible before the [[nasal bridge]] elevates.<ref name="askd"/><ref>Park, J.I. Modified Z-Epicanthoplasty in the Asian Eyelid. ARCH FACIAL PLAST SURG/VOL 2, JAN-MAR 2000.</ref>{{Primary source-inline|reason=Park hasn't researched this & cites others in the paper's intro. Those sources are inaccessible to me.|date=October 2011}}

===Medical conditions===
Epicanthic fold is sometimes found as a congenital abnormality.<ref name="epicanthic"/> Medical conditions that cause the nasal bridge not to mature and project are associated with epicanthic folds. One of the characteristics of a number of people with [[Down Syndrome]] is prominent epicanthic folds.<ref>Pham, V. (2010). COMMON OTOLARYNGOLOGICAL CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES. UTMB, Dept. of Otolaryngology. [http://www.utmb.edu/otoref/grnds/congenital-abnormal-101122/congen-abnom-101122.pdf]</ref> In 1862, [[John Langdon Down]] classified what is now called [[Down Syndrome]].  He used the term ''mongoloid'' for the condition.  This was derived from then-prevailing ethnic theory<ref name="Conor">{{cite journal |author =Conor, WO|year =1999 |title =John Langdon Down: The Man and the Message |journal =Down Syndrome Research and Practice| volume =6 |issue =1 |pages =19–24 |doi =10.3104/perspectives.94}}</ref> and from his perception that children with Down syndrome shared physical facial similarities (epicanthic folds) with those of [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach's Mongolian race]].  While the term "mongoloid" (also "mongol" or "mongoloid idiot") continued to be used until the early 1970s, it is now considered pejorative and inaccurate and is no longer in common use.<ref name="howard-jones">{{cite journal|last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman| year=1979 |title=On the diagnostic term "Down's disease" |journal=Medical History |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=102–04 |pmid=153994 |pmc=1082401}}</ref>

In [[Zellweger syndrome]], epicanthic folds are prominent.<ref>Kalyanasundaram, S. (2010). Peroxisomal Disorder-Unusual Presentation as Failure to Thrive in Early Infancy. In Indian Journal of Pediatrics. 77:1151–1152</ref>
Other examples are [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], [[phenylketonuria]], and [[Turner syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003030.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia]</ref>

==Evolutionary origin==
It is hypothesized that epicanthic folds are caused by climatic factors and it may have originated more than once during human evolution. Sexual selection may have also influenced the evolution of the trait. The genetic basis of epicanthic folds is not well understood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hotep|first=Amon|title=Race, Genetics and History|url=http://www.raceandhistory.com/historicalviews/rgh.htm|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=September 4, 2000}}</ref>
