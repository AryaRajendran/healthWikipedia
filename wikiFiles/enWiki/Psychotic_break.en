A '''psychotic break''' occurs when a person experiences an episode of acute primary [[psychosis]] - generally for the first time,<ref>Susan W. Gray, ''Competency-based Assessments in Mental Health Practice'' (2011) p. 175</ref> though it may also be after a significant symptom-free period. 

Some have suggested that (however disconcerting) such a break may be a form of psychological communication, opening the way for a less ego-bound and more emotionally grounded sense of personality.<ref>Bruce Bibee, ''The Deep Healing Process'' (2005) p. 16</ref>

==Causes==

Many things can cause temporary psychosis. Environmental triggers, such as losing a loved one, are known to contribute, as may excessive [[Stress (psychological)|stress]],<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 447</ref> or the interaction of strong social demands with a pre-existing vulnerability of self.<ref>J. F. M. Gleeson et al, ''Psychotherapies for the Psychoses'' (2008). p. 59</ref> 

Other causes that have been identified include lack of sleep, fever, brain damage, and even [[hypnosis]].<ref>Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychosis'' (1976) p. 149, 210, and 285</ref> 

War/battlefield experience may also trigger a psychotic break:<ref>Raymond J. Scurfield, ''Healing Journeys vol 2'' (2006) p. 146</ref> when reality becomes unbearable, the mind temporarily  breaks with it.<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 126</ref>

Parenthood may occasionally set off a psychotic break in men,<ref>Richard K. Reed, ''Birthing Fathers'' (2005) p. 69</ref> as may giving birth in women who have previously denied their pregnancy.<ref>Jeanne Flavin, ''Our Bodies, Our Crimes'' (2009) p. 90</ref>

===Drugs===

Several types of [[psychoactive drugs]] have been shown to correlate with psychotic breaks.<ref>Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychosis'' (1976) p. 407</ref> 

The compulsive drug user may find their ego dissociating in a psychotic break if habituation means the drug can no longer fulfil its defensive function.<ref>Kevin Volkan, ''Dancing among the Maenads'' (1994) p. 70</ref>

==Symptoms==

Symptoms of psychotic breaks vary greatly, usually depending on the circumstances of diagnosis or any contributary substance ingested. Symptoms can range from harmless, sometimes unnoticed [[delusions]], to [[violent]] outbursts and major [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]

Where a [[bipolar disorder]] is involved, crying, [[grandiosity]], insomnia, irritability, and [[persecutory delusion]]s may all or severally manifest themselves as symptoms.<ref>S. Hossein Fatemi/Paula J. Clayton eds., ''The Medical Basis of Psychiatry'' (2008) p. 412</ref>

==In popular culture==
Psychotic breaks are sometimes portrayed in novels, plays, and movies. Examples include ''[[Birdy (novel)|Birdy]]'' by William Wharton and ''[[Yellow Wallpaper]]'' by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

The crime drama television show ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' features episodes where some killers are suffering from psychotic breaks.
