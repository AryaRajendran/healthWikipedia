:''Not to be confused with [[Paruresis]]''

'''Paresis''' is a condition typified by a weakness of voluntary movement, or partial loss of voluntary movement or by impaired movement. When used without qualifiers, it usually refers to the limbs, but it also can be used to describe the muscles of the [[Human eyes|eyes]] ([[ophthalmoparesis]]), the [[stomach]] ([[gastroparesis]]), and also the [[vocal cord]]s ([[Vocal cord paresis]]).  Neurologists use the term ''paresis'' to describe weakness, and ''plegia'' to describe [[paralysis]] in which all voluntary movement is lost. The term ''paresis'' comes from the {{lang-grc|πάρεσις}} "letting go" or "paralysis" from παρίημι "to let go, to let fall."
