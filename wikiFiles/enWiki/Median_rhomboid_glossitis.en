[[File:Median Glossitis (edit).jpg|thumbnail|Madian rhombiod glossitis in a child. Note atypical appearance of the lesion, which is more commonly an erythematous, atrohpic area of depapillation]]

==Signs and symptoms==
Rarely is any soreness associated with the condition. Apart from the appearance of the lesion, there are usually no other signs or symptoms. The typical appearance of the lesion is a oval or rhomboid shaped area located in the midline of the dorsal surface of the tongue, just anterior (infront) of the [[terminal sulcus (tongue)|sulcus terminalis]]. The lesion is usually symmetric, well demarcated, erythematous and depapillated, which has a smooth, shiny surface. Less typically, the lesion may be [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or lobulated and exophytic. There may be candidal lesions at other sites in the mouth, which may lead to a diagnosis of [[Oral candidiasis#Chronic multifocal oral candidiasis|chronic multifocal oral candidiasis]]. Sometimes an approximating erythematous lesion is present on the palate (a "kissing lesion").<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> The lesion is typically 2 - 3 cm in its longest dimension.

==Causes==
Predisposing factors include smoking, denture wearing, use of [[corticosteroid]] sprays or inhalers and [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infection.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> ''Candida'' species even in healthy people mainly colonizes the posterior dorsal tongue.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> Median rhombiod glossitis is thought to be a type of chronic atrophic (or erythematous) candidiasis. Microbiological culture of the lesion usually shows ''Candida'' mixed with bacteria.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" />

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is usually made on the clinical appearance, and tissue [[biopsy]] is not usually needed. The [[Histology|histologic]] picture is one of superficial candidal [[hyphae|hyphal]] infiltration and a [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte|polymorphonuclear leukocytic]] inflammatory infiltrate present in the epithelium. The [[rete ridges]] are elongated and hyperplastic (pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, which may be mistaken for [[carcinoma]]).<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> 

==Treatment and prognosis==
Treatment may involve smoking cessation and prescription of topical or systemic [[antifungal medication]]. Usually the mucosal changes resolve with antifungal therapy, but sometimes the lesion is resistant to complete resolution.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /><ref name="OMF path textbook" /> 

==Epidemiology==
It is uncommon condition, occurring with equal prevalence in males and females and at any age.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> 

==History==
Historically, this lesion was believed to be a developmental defect of the tongue, caused by failure of the  [[tuberculum impar]] to be covered by the lateral processes of the tongue. This was disproved when a study of 10,000 children were examined and no medium rhomboid glossitis lesions were found at all. Since, a consistent correlation with ''C. albicans'' has been demonstrated.<ref name="OMF path textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W. Neville , Douglas D. Damm, Carl M.
