'''PRO 2000''' is an experimental [[vaginal microbicide]] which has been proposed as a [[preventative medicine]] for reducing the risk of contracting [[HIV]].  It has never been recommended as an effective medicine to be used for any purpose. Some [[clinical trials]] have shown that under some conditions it may provide some protection against HIV.

==History==
[[Endo Pharmaceuticals]] manufactures the drug.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/DrugsNew/DrugDetailNT.aspx?int_id=330 |title=AIDSinfo - HIV/AIDS Drug Information - PRO 2000 |first= |last= |work=aidsinfo.nih.gov |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=20 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>

==Efficacy==
[[Animal testing]] studies done on [[macaques]] have shown that PRO 2000 is effective in preventing the transmission of HIV.  Other studies have given supportive evidence that the product is safe in humans and would be an appropriate candidate for testing.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1097/OLQ.0b013e31817dfdb8}}</ref>

A [[phase III clinical trial]] of 9385 women in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] showed that PRO 2000 was not effective in preventing transmission of HIV.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61086-0}}</ref>
