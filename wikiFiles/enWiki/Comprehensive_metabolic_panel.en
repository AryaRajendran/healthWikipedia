The '''comprehensive [[metabolism|metabolic]] panel''', or '''chemical screen''', ('''CMP'''; [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] code 80053) is a [[test panel|panel]] of 14 [[blood test]]s which serves as an initial broad medical [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] tool. The CMP provides a rough check of [[kidney]] function, [[liver]] function, and [[electrolyte]] and [[fluid balance]], but it is far from perfect. Abnormal values from a CBC may be a result of [[Type_I_and_type_II_errors#Medical_testing|false positives]] and thus the CBC may need to be repeated for a patient (or replaced with a more specific test).

The CMP is an expanded version of the [[Basic Metabolic Panel|basic metabolic panel]] (BMP), which does not include liver tests. A CMP (or BMP) can be ordered as part of a routine [[physical examination]], or may be used to monitor a patient with a chronic disease, such as [[diabetes mellitus]] or [[hypertension]].

Previous names for the panel of tests have been '''Chem 12''', '''Chemistry panel''', '''Chemistry screen''', '''SMA 12''', '''SMA 20''' and '''SMAC''' (Sequential Multiple Analysis - Computer).<ref name=labtests />  The tests are performed on machines based on the [[AutoAnalyzer]] invented in 1957.

==Testing==
<div style="float:right;border:solid 10px white;">{{Blood test sample values}}</div>
Typically, the patient [[fasting|fasts]] for ten or twelve hours before the blood is drawn for the test. The following tests are then performed:<ref name=labtests>{{cite web | url = http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/cmp/glance.html| title = Comprehensive Metabolic Panel | publisher = Lab Tests Online | date = 2005-10-31 | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}</ref>

===General tests===
These tests help screen for a wide variety of problems. The [[blood sugar|glucose]] test in particular helps screen for diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes. The calcium test can indicate or monitor bone diseases or diseases of the parathyroid gland or kidneys. Calcium salts, Lithium, Thiazide diuretics, Thyroxine, and vitamin D can all increase levels and may interfere with this test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003477.htm |title=Calcium - blood test: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>
* [[Serum glucose]]
* [[Calcium in biology|Calcium]]

===Protein tests===
Tests of [[protein]] levels in the blood help screen for both kidney and liver disorders.
* [[Human serum albumin]]
* [[Serum total protein]] (TP)

===Electrolytes===
[[Electrolyte]] levels and the balance among them are tightly regulated by the body. Both individual values and ratios among the values are significant; abnormalities among either can indicate problems such as an [[electrolyte disturbance]], [[pH|acid-base]] imbalance, or kidney dysfunction.
* [[Sodium]]
* [[Potassium]]
* [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>)
* [[Chloride]]

===Kidney function assessment===
* [[Blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN)
* [[Creatinine]]

===Liver function assessment===
* [[Alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP)
* [[Alanine amino transferase]] (ALT or SGPT)
* [[Aspartate amino transferase]] (AST or SGOT)
* [[Bilirubin]]
