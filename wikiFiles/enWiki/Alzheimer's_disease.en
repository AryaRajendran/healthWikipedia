'''Alzheimer's disease''' ('''AD'''), also known in medical literature as '''Alzheimer disease''', is the most common form of [[dementia]]. There is no cure for the disease, which [[degenerative disease|worsens as it progresses]], and eventually leads to [[Terminal illness|death]]. It was first described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist [[Alois Alzheimer]] in 1906 and was named after him.<ref name="pmid9661992"/> Most often, AD is diagnosed in people over 65&nbsp;years of age,<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Brookmeyer R., Gray S., Kawas C.|title=Projections of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States and the Public Health Impact of Delaying Disease Onset|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1337–42|year=1998|month=September|pmid=9736873|pmc=1509089|doi=10.2105/AJPH.88.9.1337}}</ref> although the less-prevalent [[early-onset Alzheimer's]] can occur much earlier.

The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of [[cognitive]] and [[functional symptom|functional]] [[Disability|impairments]].

===Pre-dementia===
The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to [[ageing]] or [[stress (biology)|stress]].<ref name="pmid17222085"/> Detailed [[neuropsychological test]]ing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for [[diagnosis]] of AD.<ref name="pmid15324363">{{vcite journal|author=Bäckman L, Jones S, Berger AK, Laukka EJ, Small BJ|title=Multiple Cognitive Deficits During the Transition to Alzheimer's Disease|journal=J Intern Med|volume=256|issue=3|pages=195–204|year=2004|month=Sep|pmid=15324363|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2004.01386.x}}</ref> These early symptoms can affect the most complex [[Activities of daily living|daily living activities]].<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Nygård L|title=Instrumental Activities of Daily Living: A Stepping-stone Towards Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment?|journal=Acta Neurol Scand|volume=Suppl|issue=179|pages=42–6|year=2003|pmid=12603250|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0404.107.s179.8.x}}</ref> The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.<ref name="pmid15324363"/><ref name="pmid12603249">{{vcite journal|author=Arnáiz E, Almkvist O|title=Neuropsychological Features of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Acta Neurol.

Subtle problems with the [[executive functions]] of [[attention|attentiveness]], [[planning]], flexibility, and [[abstraction|abstract thinking]], or impairments in [[semantic memory]] (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD.<ref name="pmid15324363"/> [[Apathy]] can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] symptom throughout the course of the disease.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Landes AM, Sperry SD, Strauss ME, Geldmacher DS|title=Apathy in Alzheimer's Disease|journal=J Am Geriatr Soc|volume=49|issue=12|pages=1700–7|year=2001|month=Dec|pmid=11844006|doi=10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49282.x}}</ref> The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed [[mild cognitive impairment]],<ref name="pmid12603249"/> but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute.<ref name="pmid17279076">{{vcite journal|author=Petersen RC|title=The Current Status of Mild Cognitive Impairment—What Do We Tell Our Patients?|journal=Nat Clin Pract Neurol|volume=3|issue=2|pages=60–1|year=2007|month=February|pmid=17279076|doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0402}}</ref>

===Early===
In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with language, executive functions, [[perception]] ([[agnosia]]), or execution of movements ([[apraxia]]) are more prominent than memory problems.<ref name="pmid10653284">{{vcite journal|author=Förstl H, Kurz A|title=Clinical Features of Alzheimer's Disease|journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=249|issue=6|pages=288–290|year=1999|pmid=10653284|doi=10.1007/s004060050101}}</ref> AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. [[long-term memory|Older memories]] of the person's life ([[episodic memory]]), facts learned ([[semantic memory]]), and [[implicit memory]] (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.<ref name="pmid1300219">{{vcite journal|author=Carlesimo GA, Oscar-Berman M|title=Memory Deficits in Alzheimer's Patients: A Comprehensive Review|journal=Neuropsychol Rev|volume=3|issue=2|pages=119–69|year=1992|month=June|pmid=1300219|doi=10.1007/BF01108841}}</ref><ref name="pmid8821346">{{vcite journal|author=Jelicic M, Bonebakker AE, Bonke B|title=Implicit Memory Performance of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Brief Review|journal=International Psychogeriatrics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385–392|year=1995|pmid=8821346|doi=10.1017/S1041610295002134}}</ref>

[[primary progressive aphasia|Language problems]] are mainly characterised by a shrinking [[vocabulary]] and decreased word [[fluency]], which lead to a general impoverishment of oral and [[written language]].<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid1856925">{{cite journal|author=Taler V, Phillips NA|title=Language Performance in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: a comparative review|journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol|volume=30|issue=5|pages=501–56|year=2008|month=July|pmid=18569251|doi=10.1080/13803390701550128}}</ref> In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid1856925"/><ref name="pmid7967534">{{vcite journal|author=Frank EM|title=Effect of Alzheimer's Disease on Communication Function|journal=J S C Med Assoc|volume=90|issue=9|pages=417–23|year=1994|month=September|pmid=7967534}}</ref> While performing [[fine motor skill|fine motor tasks]] such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties ([[apraxia]]) may be present but they are commonly unnoticed.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

===Moderate===
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to [[Anomic aphasia|recall vocabulary]], which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ([[paraphasia]]s). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7967534"/> Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Long-term memory]], which was previously intact, becomes impaired.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

Behavioural and [[neuropsychiatric]] changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are [[Wandering (dementia)|wandering]], [[irritability]] and [[labile affect]], leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated [[aggression]], or resistance to caregiving.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Sundowning]] can also appear.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Volicer L, Harper DG, Manning BC, Goldstein R, Satlin A|title=Sundowning and Circadian Rhythms in Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Am J Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=5|pages=704–11|year=2001|month=May|pmid=11329390|accessdate=2008-08-27|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704}}</ref> Approximately 30% of people with AD develop [[Delusional misidentification syndrome|illusionary misidentifications]] and other [[delusion]]al symptoms.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations ([[anosognosia]]).<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[Urinary incontinence]] can develop.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> These symptoms create [[stress (biology)|stress]] for relatives and caretakers, which can be reduced by moving the person from [[home care]] to other [[Nursing home|long-term care facilities]].<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7806732">{{vcite journal|author=Gold DP, Reis MF, Markiewicz D, Andres D|title=When Home Caregiving Ends: A Longitudinal Study of Outcomes for Caregivers of Relatives with Dementia|journal=J Am Geriatr Soc|volume=43|issue=1|pages=10–6|year=1995|month=January|pmid=7806732}}</ref>

===Advanced===
During the final stage of AD, the person is completely dependent upon caregivers.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech.<ref name="pmid10653284"/><ref name="pmid7967534"/> Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme [[apathy]] and [[exhaustion]] are much more common results.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>
People with AD will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks without assistance.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> [[musculature|Muscle mass]] and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden, and they lose the ability to feed themselves.<ref name="pmid10653284"/> AD is a terminal illness, with the cause of death typically being an external factor, such as infection of [[pressure ulcer]]s or [[pneumonia]], not the disease itself.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

==Cause==
[[File:TAU HIGH.JPG|thumb|right|Upright|Microscopic image of a neurofibrillary tangle, conformed by hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]]]]
The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still essentially unknown<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alz.org/research/science/alzheimers_disease_causes.asp|title=What We Know Today About Alzheimer's Disease|publisher=Alzheimer's Association|accessdate=1 October 2011|quote=While scientists know Alzheimer's disease involves progressive brain cell failure, the reason cells fail isn't clear.}}
</ref> (except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified).
Several competing [[hypotheses]] exist trying to explain the cause of the disease:

===Cholinergic hypothesis===
The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the ''[[cholinergic]] hypothesis'',<ref name="pmid10071091">{{vcite journal|author=Francis PT, Palmer AM, Snape M, Wilcock GK|title=The Cholinergic Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease: a Review of Progress|journal=J.

The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid,<ref name="pmid15236795">{{vcite journal|author=Shen ZX|title=Brain Cholinesterases: II.

===Amyloid hypothesis===
In 1991, the ''[[Beta amyloid|amyloid]] hypothesis'' postulated that beta-amyloid (βA) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease.<ref name="pmid1763432">{{vcite journal|author=Hardy J, Allsop D|title=Amyloid Deposition as the Central Event in the Aetiology of Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Trends Pharmacol.

In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="Nikolaev">{{vcite journal|author=Nikolaev A, McLaughlin T, O'Leary D, [[Marc Tessier-Lavigne|Tessier-Lavigne M]]|date=19 February 2009|title=APP Binds DR6 to Cause Axon Pruning and Neuron Death via Distinct Caspases|journal=Nature|volume=457|issue=7232|pages=981–989|issn=0028-0836|pmid=19225519|pmc=2677572|doi=10.1038/nature07767}}</ref> N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's [[N-terminus]], is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes.

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions.

[[File:TANGLES HIGH.jpg|300px|thumb|In Alzheimer's disease, changes in tau protein lead to the disintegration of microtubules in brain cells.]]

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]]. Every neuron has a [[cytoskeleton]], an internal support structure partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A protein called ''tau'' stabilises the microtubules when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]]. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]]; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.<ref name="pmid17604998">{{vcite journal|author=Hernández F, Avila J|title=Tauopathies|journal=Cell.

The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta-amyloid [[peptide]]s as the central event triggering neuron degeneration.

The vast majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, meaning that they are not genetically inherited although some genes may act as risk factors.

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]], is the reduction of [[cognitive deficit]]s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities.

Stimulation-oriented treatments include [[Art therapy|art]], [[Music therapy|music]] and [[Animal-assisted therapy|pet]] therapies, [[Physical therapy|exercise]], and any other kind of [[Recreational therapy|recreational activities]].

The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.<ref name="pmid10653284"/>

Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.

Regarding incidence, [[cohort study|cohort]] [[longitudinal studies]] (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD,<ref name="pmid17727890">{{vcite journal|author=Bermejo-Pareja F, Benito-León J, Vega S, Medrano MJ, Román GC|title=Incidence and subtypes of dementia in three elderly populations of central Spain|journal=J.

Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every five years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years.<ref name="pmid17727890"/><ref name="pmid12028245"/> There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85.<ref name="pmid12028245"/><ref>{{vcite journal|author=Andersen K|title=Gender Differences in the Incidence of AD and Vascular Dementia: The EURODEM Studies.

Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group.<ref>2000 U.S. estimates:

The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and [[pathological]] manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes.<ref name="isbn0-89004-225-X">{{cite book|author=Katzman Robert, Terry Robert D, Bick Katherine L (editors)|title=Alzheimer's Disease: Senile Dementia and Related Disorders|publisher=Raven Press|location=New York|year=1978|page=595|isbn=0-89004-225-X}}</ref> This eventually led to the diagnosis of ''Alzheimer's disease'' independently of age.<ref name="pmid9702682">{{vcite journal|author=Boller F, Forbes MM|title=History of Dementia and Dementia in History: An Overview|journal=J.

==Society and culture==

===Social costs===
Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States,<ref name="pmid15685097"/><ref name="pmid9543467"/> while their cost in other countries such as [[Argentina]],<ref name="pmid16870037">{{vcite journal|author=Allegri RF|title=Economic Impact of Dementia in Developing Countries: An Evaluation of Costs of Alzheimer-type Dementia in Argentina|journal=Int Psychogeriatr|volume=19|issue=4|pages=705–18|year=2007|month=August|pmid=16870037|doi=10.1017/S1041610206003784|author2=Butman J|author3=Arizaga RL|display-authors=3|last4=Machnicki|first4=Gerardo|last5=Serrano|first5=Cecilia|last6=Taragano|first6=Fernando E.|last7=Sarasola|first7=Diego|last8=Lon|first8=Leandro}}</ref> or [[South Korea]],<ref name="pmid16858741">{{vcite journal|author=Suh GH, Knapp M, Kang CJ|title=The Economic Costs of Dementia in Korea, 2002|journal=Int J Geriatr Psychiatry|volume=21|issue=8|pages=722–8|year=2006|month=August|pmid=16858741|doi=10.1002/gps.1552}}</ref> is also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the [[ageing]] of society, becoming an important [[social issue|social problem]]. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as [[nursing]] [[home care]], direct nonmedical costs such as in-home [[day care]], and indirect costs such as lost [[productivity]] of both patient and caregiver.<ref name="pmid9543467"/> Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160&nbsp;billion,<ref name="pmid16401889">{{vcite journal|author=Wimo A, Jonsson L, Winblad B|title=An Estimate of the Worldwide Prevalence and Direct Costs of Dementia in 2003|journal=Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord|volume=21|issue=3|pages=175–81|year=2006|pmid=16401889|doi=10.1159/000090733}}</ref> while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100&nbsp;billion each year.<ref name="pmid9543467"/>

The greatest origin of costs for society is the [[long-term care]] by [[Health care provider|health care professionals]] and particularly [[institutionalisation]], which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society.<ref name="pmid15685097"/> [[Cost-of-living index|The cost of living]] at home is also very high,<ref name="pmid15685097"/> especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.<ref name="pmid11445614">{{vcite journal|author=Moore MJ, Zhu CW, Clipp EC|title=Informal Costs of Dementia Care: Estimates from the National Longitudinal Caregiver Study|journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci|volume=56|issue=4|pages=S219–28|year=2001|month=July|pmid=11445614|doi=10.1093/geronb/56.4.S219}}</ref>
