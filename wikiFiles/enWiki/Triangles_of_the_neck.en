Anatomists use the term '''triangles of the neck''' to describe the divisions created by the major muscles in the region.

The side of the [[neck]] presents a somewhat quadrilateral outline, limited, above, by the lower border of the body of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], and an imaginary line extending from the angle of the mandible to the [[mastoid process]]; below, by the upper border of the [[clavicle]]; in front, by the middle line of the neck; behind, by the anterior margin of the [[trapezius]]. 

This space is subdivided into two large triangles by [[sternocleidomastoid]], which passes obliquely across the neck, from the [[Human sternum|sternum]] and [[clavicle]] below, to the [[mastoid process]] and [[occipital bone]] above. 

The triangular space in front of this muscle is called the [[anterior triangle of the neck]]; and that behind it, the [[posterior triangle of the neck]].

==Clinical Relevance==
The use of the divisions described as the triangles of the neck permit the effective communication of the location of palpable masses located in the neck between healthcare professionals.
