A '''chronic wound''' is a [[wound]] that does not heal in an orderly set of stages and in a predictable amount of time the way most wounds do; wounds that do not heal within three months are often considered chronic.<ref name="mustoe05">{{cite conference |author=Mustoe T |title=Dermal ulcer healing: Advances in understanding |booktitle=Tissue repair and ulcer/wound healing: molecular mechanisms, therapeutic targets and future directions  |pages=  |publisher= EUROCONFERENCES |date=March 17–18, 2005 |location=Paris, France |url=http://www.pasteur.fr/applications/euroconf/tissuerepair/Mustoe_abstract.pdf}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

Chronic wound patients often report [[pain]] as dominant in their lives.<ref name=Krasner>{{cite journal |pmid=9678007 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1071-5754&volume=25&issue=3&spage=158 |year=1998 |last1=Krasner |first1=D |title=Painful venous ulcers: Themes and stories about living with the pain and suffering |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=158–68 |journal=Journal of wound, ostomy, and continence nursing}}</ref>  
It is recommended that healthcare providers handle the pain related to chronic wounds as one of the main priorities in chronic wound management (together with addressing the cause). Six out of ten venous leg ulcer patients experience pain with their ulcer,<ref name=Hofman>{{cite journal |pmid=9256727 |year=1997 |last1=Hofman |first1=D |last2=Ryan |first2=TJ |last3=Arnold |first3=F |last4=Cherry |first4=GW |last5=Lindholm |first5=C |last6=Bjellerup |first6=M |last7=Glynn |first7=C |title=Pain in venous leg ulcers |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=222–4 |journal=Journal of wound care}}</ref> and similar trends are observed for other chronic wounds. 

Persistent pain (at night, at rest, and with activity) is the main problem for patients with chronic ulcers.<ref name=Walshe>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.1995.tb03110.x |title=Living with a venous leg ulcer: A descriptive study of patients'experiences |year=2006 |last1=Walshe |first1=Catherine |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=1092–100 |pmid=8675863}}</ref> Frustrations regarding ineffective [[analgesic]]s and plans of care that they were unable to [[compliance (medicine)|adhere]] to were also identified.

==Cause==

In addition to poor [[blood circulation|circulation]], neuropathy, and difficulty moving, factors that contribute to chronic wounds include systemic illnesses, age, and repeated [[physical trauma|trauma]].  [[Comorbidity|Comorbid]] ailments that may contribute to the formation of chronic wounds include [[vasculitis]] (an inflammation of blood vessels), [[immune suppression]], [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], and diseases that cause [[ischemia]].<ref name=snyder/>  Immune suppression can be caused by illnesses or medical [[Medication|drug]]s used over a long period, for example [[steroid]]s.<ref name=snyder/>  [[Emotional stress]] can also negatively affect the healing of a wound, possibly by raising [[blood pressure]] and levels of [[cortisol]], which lowers immunity.<ref name=Augustin/>

What appears to be a chronic wound may also be a [[malignancy]]; for example, [[cancer]]ous tissue can grow until blood cannot reach the cells and the tissue becomes an ulcer.<ref name=Trent>Trent, JT.  2003.  [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3977/is_200301/ai_n9220282 Wounds and malignancy.]  ''Advances in Skin & Wound Care''.  Accessed January 1, 2007.</ref>  Cancer, especially [[squamous cell carcinoma]], may also form as the result of chronic wounds, probably due to repetitive tissue damage that stimulates rapid [[cell proliferation]].<ref name=Trent/>
	
Another factor that may contribute to chronic wounds is old age.<ref name=Mustoe/>  The skin of older people is more easily damaged, and older cells do not proliferate as fast and may not have an adequate response to stress in terms of [[gene upregulation]] of stress-related [[protein]]s.<ref name=Mustoe/>  In older cells, stress response [[gene]]s are overexpressed when the cell is not stressed, but when it is, the expression of these proteins is not upregulated by as much as in younger cells.<ref name=Mustoe/>

Comorbid factors that can lead to ischemia are especially likely to contribute to chronic wounds.  Such factors include chronic [[fibrosis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[edema]], [[sickle cell disease]], and [[arterial insufficiency]]-related illnesses.<ref name=snyder/>

Repeated [[physical trauma]] plays a role in chronic wound formation by continually initiating the inflammatory cascade.  The trauma may occur by accident, for example when a leg is repeatedly bumped against a [[wheelchair]] rest, or it may be due to intentional acts.  [[Heroin]] users who lose venous access may resort to '[[skin popping]]', or injecting the drug [[subcutaneous]]ly, which is highly damaging to tissue and frequently leads to chronic ulcers.<ref name="Williams and Southern">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2005.04.024 |title=Conflicts in the treatment of chronic ulcers in drug addicts—case series and discussion |year=2005 |last1=Williams |first1=A.M. |last2=Southern |first2=S.J. |journal=British Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=58 |issue=7 |pages=997–9 |pmid=16040018}}</ref>  Children who are repeatedly seen for a wound that does not heal are sometimes found to be victims of a parent with [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], a disease in which the abuser may repeatedly inflict harm on the child in order to receive attention.<ref name=Vennemann>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.07.014 |title=A case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy with subsequent suicide of the mother |year=2006 |last1=Vennemann |first1=B. |last2=Perdekamp |first2=M.

==Pathophysiology==

Chronic wounds may affect only the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and [[dermis]], or they may affect tissues all the way to the [[fascia]].<ref name=crovetti/>  They may be formed originally by the same things that cause acute ones, such as [[surgery]] or accidental trauma, or they may form as the result of systemic infection, vascular, immune, or nerve insufficiency, or comorbidities such as [[neoplasia]]s or metabolic disorders.<ref name=crovetti/>  The reason a wound becomes chronic is that the body’s ability to deal with the damage is overwhelmed by factors such as repeated trauma, continued pressure, ischemia, or illness.<ref name=moreo/><ref name=crovetti/>

Though much progress has been accomplished in the study of chronic wounds lately, advances in the study of their healing have lagged behind expectations.  This is partly because [[animal testing|animal studies]] are difficult because animals do not get chronic wounds, since they usually have loose skin that quickly contracts, and they normally do not get old enough or have contributing diseases such as neuropathy or chronic debilitating illnesses.<ref name=Mustoe/>  Nonetheless, current researchers now understand some of the major factors that lead to chronic wounds, among which are ischemia, [[reperfusion injury]], and [[bacteria]]l colonization.<ref name=Mustoe/>

===Ischemia===

Ischemia is an important factor in the formation and persistence of wounds, especially when it occurs repetitively (as it usually does) or when combined with a patient’s old age.<ref name=Mustoe/>  Ischemia causes tissue to become inflamed and cells to release factors that attract [[neutrophil]]s such as [[interleukin]]s, [[chemokine]]s, [[leukotriene]]s, and [[complement factor]]s.<ref name=Mustoe/>  

While they fight pathogens, neutrophils also release inflammatory [[cytokine]]s and enzymes that damage cells.<ref name=snyder/><ref name=Mustoe/>  One of their important jobs is to produce [[Reactive Oxygen Species|Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)]] to kill bacteria, for which they use an enzyme called [[myeloperoxidase]].<ref name=Mustoe/>  The enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging [[DNA]], [[lipid]]s, proteins,<ref name=Alleva>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.119 |title=Α-Lipoic acid supplementation inhibits oxidative damage, accelerating chronic wound healing in patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy |year=2005 |last1=Alleva |first1=Renata |last2=Nasole |first2=Emanuele |last3=Donato |first3=Ferruccio Di |last4=Borghi |first4=Battista |last5=Neuzil |first5=Jiri |last6=Tomasetti |first6=Marco |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=333 |issue=2 |pages=404–10 |pmid=15950945}}</ref> the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM), and cytokines that speed healing.<ref name=Mustoe/>  Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds for longer than they do in acute wounds, and contribute to the fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS.<ref name=taylor/><ref name=schon/>  Since wound fluid from chronic wounds has an excess of proteases and ROS, the fluid itself can inhibit healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the ECM.<ref name=snyder/>

===Bacterial colonization===

Since more oxygen in the wound environment allows white blood cells to produce ROS to kill bacteria, patients with inadequate tissue oxygenation, for example those who suffered hypothermia during surgery, are at higher risk for infection.<ref name=Mustoe/>  The host’s [[immune response]] to the presence of bacteria prolongs inflammation, delays healing, and damages tissue.<ref name=Mustoe/>  Infection can lead not only to chronic wounds but also to [[gangrene]], loss of the infected limb, and [[death]] of the patient.

Like ischemia, bacterial colonization and infection damage tissue by causing a greater number of neutrophils to enter the wound site.<ref name=snyder/> In patients with chronic wounds, bacteria with [[antibiotic resistance|resistances]] to antibiotics may have time to develop.<ref name="Halcón">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2003.12.008 |title=And wounds: A review of tea tree oil as a promising antimicrobial |year=2004 |last1=Halcon |first1=L |last2=Milkus |first2=K |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=402–8 |pmid=15525915}}</ref>  In addition, patients that carry drug resistant bacterial strains such as [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA) have more chronic wounds.<ref name="Halcón"/>

===Growth factors and proteolytic enzymes===

Chronic wounds also differ in makeup from acute wounds in that their levels of [[proteolytic enzyme]]s such as [[elastase]].<ref name=Edwards/> and [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s (MMPs) are higher,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1523-1747.ep12359590 |title=Wound Fluid from Chronic Leg Ulcers Contains Elevated Levels of Metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 |year=1993 |last1=Wysocki |first1=Annette B. |last2=Staiano-Coico |first2=Lisa |last3=Grinnell |first3=Frederick |journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology |volume=101 |pages=64–8 |pmid=8392530 |issue=1}}</ref> while their concentrations of growth factors such as [[Platelet-derived growth factor]] and [[Keratinocyte Growth Factor]] are lower.<ref name=schon/><ref name=crovetti/>

Since growth factors (GFs) are imperative in timely wound healing, inadequate GF levels may be an important factor in chronic wound formation.<ref name=crovetti/>  In chronic wounds, the formation and release of growth factors may be prevented, the factors may be sequestered and unable to perform their metabolic roles, or degraded in excess by cellular or bacterial proteases.<ref name=crovetti/>

Chronic wounds such as diabetic and venous ulcers are also caused by a failure of [[fibroblast]]s to produce adequate ECM proteins and by [[keratinocyte]]s to epithelialize the wound.<ref name=Foy>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2003.10.595 |title=Analysis of fibroblast defects in extracellular matrix production in chronic wounds |year=2004 |last1=Foy |first1=Yvonne |last2=Li |first2=Jie |last3=Kirsner |first3=Robert |last4=Eaglstein |first4=William |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=P168}}</ref>  Fibroblast gene expression is different in chronic wounds than in acute wounds.<ref name=Foy/>

Though all wounds require a certain level of elastase and proteases for proper healing, too high a concentration is damaging.<ref name=Edwards/>  Leukocytes in the wound area release elastase, which increases inflammation, destroys tissue, [[proteoglycans]], and [[collagen]],<ref name=kanda>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jdermsci.2004.10.011 |title=Regulatory roles of sex hormones in cutaneous biology and immunology |year=2005 |last1=Kanda |first1=Naoko |last2=Watanabe |first2=Shinichi |journal=Journal of Dermatological Science |volume=38 |pages=1–7 |pmid=15795118 |issue=1}}</ref> and damages growth factors, fibronectin, and factors that inhibit proteases.<ref name=Edwards/>  The activity of elastase is increased by [[human serum albumin]], which is the most abundant protein found in chronic wounds.<ref name=Edwards/>  However, chronic wounds with inadequate albumin are especially unlikely to heal, so regulating the wound's levels of that protein may in the future prove helpful in healing chronic wounds.<ref name=Edwards/>

Excess matrix metalloproteinases, which are released by leukocytes, may also cause wounds to become chronic.  MMPs break down ECM molecules, growth factors, and protease inhibitors, and thus increase degradation while reducing construction, throwing the delicate compromise between production and degradation out of balance.<ref name=schon/><ref name=Lai>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.065 |title=Mitosis increases levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in keratinocytes |year=2004 |last1=Lai |first1=Jeng-Yu |last2=Borson |first2=Nancy D |last3=Strausbauch |first3=Michael A |last4=Pittelkow |first4=Mark R |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=316 |issue=2 |pages=407–10 |pmid=15020232}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
===Infection===
If a chronic wound becomes more painful this is a good indication that it is infected.<ref name=Infection2012>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2012.98 |title=Does This Patient Have an Infection of a Chronic Wound? |year=2012 |last1=Reddy |first1=Madhuri |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=307 |issue=6 |pages=605}}</ref> A lack of pain however does not mean that it is not infected.<ref name=Infection2012/> Other methods of determination are less effective.<ref name=Infection2012/>

===Classification===
The vast majority of chronic wounds can be classified into three categories: [[venous ulcer]]s, [[diabetes|diabetic]], and [[pressure ulcer]]s.<ref name=moreo/><ref name=Mustoe/>  A small number of wounds that do not fall into these categories may be due to causes such as [[radiation poisoning]] or [[ischemia]].<ref name=Mustoe/>

====Venous and arterial ulcers====

[[Venous ulcer]]s, which usually occur in the legs, account for about 70% to 90% of chronic wounds<ref name=snyder/> and mostly affect the elderly.  They are thought to be due to [[venous hypertension]] caused by improper function of [[venous valve|valves]] that exist in the [[vein]]s to prevent blood from flowing backward.  [[Ischemia]] results from the dysfunction and, combined with [[reperfusion injury]], causes the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage that leads to the wounds.

====Diabetic ulcers====

Another major cause of chronic wounds, [[diabetes]], is increasing in prevalence.<ref name=Velander>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2004.05.119 |title=Autologous cultured keratinocytes suspensions accelerate re-epithelialization in the diabetic pig |year=2004 |last1=Velander |first1=Patrik E. |last2=Theopold |first2=Christoph |last3=Gheerardyn |first3=Raphael |last4=Bleiziffer |first4=Oliver |last5=Yao |first5=Feng |last6=Eriksson |first6=Elof |journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons |volume=199 |issue=3 |pages=58}}</ref>  Diabetics have a 15% higher risk for [[amputation]] than the general population<ref name=snyder/> due to chronic ulcers.  Diabetes causes [[diabetic neuropathy|neuropathy]], which inhibits [[nociception]] and the [[perception]] of [[pain]].<ref name=snyder/>  Thus patients may not initially notice small wounds to legs and feet, and may therefore fail to prevent [[infection]] or repeated [[injury]].<ref name=moreo/>  Further, diabetes causes [[immune compromise]] and damage to small blood vessels, preventing adequate oxygenation of tissue, which can cause chronic wounds.<ref name=moreo/> Pressure also plays a role in the formation of diabetic ulcers.<ref name=Mustoe/>

====Pressure ulcers====

Another leading type of chronic wounds is pressure ulcers,<ref name=supp/> which usually occur in people with conditions such as [[paralysis]] that inhibit movement of body parts that are commonly subjected to pressure such as the heels, shoulder blades, and [[sacrum]].<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2004.12.007 |title=A controlled, randomized, comparative study of a radiant heat bandage on the healing of stage 3–4 pressure ulcers: A pilot study |year=2005 |last1=Thomas |first1=David R. |last2=Diebold |first2=Marilyn R. |last3=Eggemeyer |first3=Linda M. |journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association |volume=6 |pages=46–9 |pmid=15871870 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name=Wilhelmi>{{EMedicine|plastic|462|Pressure ulcers: Surgical treatment and principles}}</ref>  Pressure ulcers are caused by ischemia that occurs when pressure on the tissue is greater than the pressure in [[capillary (blood vessel)|capillaries]], and thus restricts blood flow into the area.<ref name=supp/>  Muscle tissue, which needs more oxygen and [[nutrient]]s than [[skin]] does, shows the worst effects from prolonged pressure.<ref name=Wilhelmi/>  As in other chronic ulcers, [[reperfusion injury]] damages tissue.

==Treatment==

Though treatment of the different chronic wound types varies slightly, appropriate treatment seeks to address the problems at the root of chronic wounds, including ischemia, bacterial load, and imbalance of proteases.<ref name=Mustoe/>  Various methods exist to ameliorate these problems, including antibiotic and antibacterial use, debridement, irrigation, [[VAC Therapy|vacuum-assisted closure]], warming, oxygenation, moist wound healing, removing mechanical stress, and adding cells or other materials to secrete or enhance levels of healing factors.<ref name=Velander/>

===Preventing and treating infection===

To lower the bacterial count in wounds, therapists may use topical [[antibiotic]]s, which kill bacteria and can also help by keeping the wound environment moist,<ref name=brem>{{cite journal |author=Brem H, Kirsner RS, Falanga V |title=Protocol for the successful treatment of venous ulcers |journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=188 |issue=1A Suppl |pages=1–8 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15223495 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9610(03)00284-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002961003002848}}</ref><ref name=Patel>{{cite journal |author=Patel CV, Powell L, Wilson SE |title=Surgical wound infections |journal=Current Treatment Options in Infectious Diseases' |volume=2 |pages=147–53 |year=2000 |issn=1523-3820}}</ref> 
which is important for speeding the healing of chronic wounds.<ref name=taylor/><ref name=thomas/>  Some researchers have experimented with the use of [[tea tree oil]], an antibacterial agent which also has anti-inflammatory effects.<ref name="Halcón"/>  [[Disinfectants]] are contraindicated because they damage tissues and delay wound contraction.<ref name=Patel/>  Further, they are rendered ineffective by organic matter in wounds like blood and [[exudate]] and are thus not useful in open wounds.<ref name=Patel/>

A greater amount of exudate and [[necrotic tissue]] in a wound increases likelihood of infection by serving as a medium for bacterial growth away from the host’s defenses.<ref name=Mustoe/>  Since bacteria thrive on dead tissue, wounds are often surgically [[debridement|debrided]] to remove the devitalized tissue.<ref name=brem/>  Debridement and drainage of wound fluid are an especially important part of the treatment for diabetic ulcers, which may create the need for amputation if infection gets out of control.  Mechanical removal of bacteria and devitalized tissue is also the idea behind [[wound irrigation]], which is accomplished using pulsed [[lavage]].<ref name=Mustoe/>

Removing necrotic or devitalzed tissue is also the aim of [[maggot therapy]], the intentional introduction by a health care practitioner of live, disinfected [[maggot]]s into non-healing wounds.  Maggots dissolve only necrotic, infected tissue; disinfect the wound by killing bacteria; and stimulate wound healing.  Maggot therapy has been shown to accelerate debridement of necrotic wounds and reduce the bacterial load of the wound, leading to earlier healing, reduced wound odor and less pain.  The combination and interactions of these actions make maggots an extremely potent tool in chronic wound care.

[[Negative pressure wound therapy]] (NPWT) is a treatment that improves ischemic tissues and removes wound fluid used by bacteria.<ref name=moreo/><ref name=Mustoe/>  This therapy, also known as vacuum-assisted closure, reduces swelling in tissues, which brings more blood and nutrients to the area, as does the negative pressure itself.<ref name=moreo/>  The treatment also decompresses tissues and alters the shape of cells, causes them to express different [[mRNA]]s and to proliferate and produce ECM molecules.<ref name=snyder/><ref name=moreo/>

===Treating trauma and painful wounds===
Persistent [[chronic pain]] associated with non-healing wounds is caused by tissue ([[nociceptive]]) or nerve ([[neuropathic]]) damage and is influenced by dressing changes and chronic [[inflammation]]. Chronic wounds take a long time to heal and patients can suffer from chronic wounds for many years.<ref name=flanagan>Flanagan M, Vogensen H, and Haase L. 2006. [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2006/april/Flanagan/Ibuprofen-Foam-Dressing.html Case series investigating the experience of pain in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers treated with a foam dressing releasing ibuprofen.] World Wide Wounds. 2006</ref> Chronic wound healing may be compromised by coexisting underlying conditions, such as [[venous ulcer|venous valve backflow]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], uncontrolled edema and [[diabetes mellitus]].

If wound [[pain]] is not assessed and documented it may be ignored and/or not addressed properly. It is important to remember that increased wound pain may be an indicator of wound complications that need treatment, and therefore practitioners must constantly reassess the wound as well as the associated pain. 

Optimal management of wounds requires holistic assessment. Documentation of the patient’s pain experience is critical and may range from the use of a patient diary, (which should be patient driven), to recording pain entirely by the healthcare professional or caregiver.<ref name=osterbrink>{{cite journal |author=Osterbrink J |title=Der Deutsche Schmerzstandard und seine Auswirkungen auf die Pflege |journal=Die Schwester, der Pfleger |volume=42 |pages=758–64 |year=2003}}</ref> Effective communication between the patient and the healthcare team is fundamental to this holistic approach. The more frequently healthcare professionals measure pain, the greater the likelihood of introducing or changing pain management practices.

At present there are few local options for the treatment of persistent pain, whilst managing the exudate levels present in many chronic wounds. Important properties of such local options are that they provide an optimal wound healing environment, while providing a constant local low dose release of ibuprofen during weartime.

If local treatment does not provide adequate pain reduction, it may be necessary for patients with chronic painful wounds to be prescribed additional systemic treatment for the physical component of their pain.  Clinicians should consult with their prescribing colleagues referring to the [http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/painladder/en/ WHO pain relief ladder] of systemic treatment options for guidance. For every pharmacological intervention there are possible benefits and adverse events that the prescribing clinician will need to consider in conjunction with the wound care treatment team.

===Ischemia and hypoxia===

Blood vessels constrict in tissue that becomes cold and dilate in warm tissue, altering blood flow to the area.  Thus keeping the tissues warm is probably necessary to fight both infection and ischemia.<ref name=thomas/>  Some healthcare professionals use ‘[[radiant bandage]]s’ to keep the area warm, and care must be taken during surgery to prevent [[hypothermia]], which increases rates of post-surgical infection.<ref name=Mustoe/>  

Underlying ischemia may also be treated surgically by [[arterial revascularization]], for example in diabetic ulcers, and patients with venous ulcers may undergo surgery to correct vein dysfunction.

Diabetics that are not candidates for surgery (and others) may also have their tissue oxygenation increased by [[Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy]], or HBOT, which can compensate for limitations of blood supply and correct [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref name=Alleva/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004123.pub2 |chapter=Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for chronic wounds |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2004 |last1=Kranke |first1=Peter |last2=Bennett |first2=Michael H |last3=Debus |first3=Sebastian E |last4=Roeckl-Wiedmann |first4=Irmgard |last5=Schnabel |first5=Alexander |editor1-last=Kranke |editor1-first=Peter |pmid=15106239 |issue=2 |pages=CD004123}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zamboni WA, Wong HP, Stephenson LL, Pfeifer MA |title=Evaluation of hyperbaric oxygen for diabetic wounds: a prospective study |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–9 |year=1997 |month=September |pmid=9308140 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2279 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref>  In addition to killing bacteria, higher oxygen content in tissues speeds growth factor production, fibroblast growth, and [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=snyder/><ref name=Alleva/>  However, increased oxygen levels also means increased production of ROS.<ref name=Alleva/>  [[Antioxidant]]s, molecules that can lose an electron to free radicals without themselves becoming radicals, can lower levels of oxidants in the body and have been used with some success in wound healing.<ref name=schon/>

Low level laser therapy has been repeatedly shown to significantly reduce the size and severity of diabetic ulcers as well as other pressure ulcers.

Pressure wounds are often the result of local ischemia from the increased pressure. Increased pressure also plays a roles in many diabetic foot ulcerations as changes due to the disease causes the foot to suffer limited joint mobility and creates pressure points on the bottom of the foot. Effective measures to treat this includes a surgical procedure called the gastrocnemius recession in which the calf muscle is lengthened to decrease the fulcrum created by this muscle and resulting in a decrease in plantar forefoot pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/j.jfas.2009.07.002 |title=Gastrocnemius Recession as an Alternative to TendoAchillis Lengthening for Relief of Forefoot Pressure in a Patient with Peripheral Neuropathy: A Case Report and Description of a Technical Modification |year=2010 |last1=Greenhagen |first1=Robert M. |last2=Johnson |first2=Adam R. |last3=Peterson |first3=Matthew C. |last4=Rogers |first4=Lee C. |last5=Bevilacqua |first5=Nicholas J. |journal=The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery |volume=49 |issue=2 |pmid=20137982 |pages=159.e9–13}}</ref>

===Growth factors and hormones===

Since chronic wounds underexpress growth factors necessary for healing tissue, chronic wound healing may be speeded by replacing or stimulating those factors and by preventing the excessive formation of proteases like elastase that break them down.<ref name=Edwards/><ref name=schon/>

One way to increase growth factor concentrations in wounds is to apply the growth factors directly, though this takes many repetitions and requires large amounts of the factors.<ref name=schon/>  Another way is to spread onto the wound a gel of the patient’s own [[blood platelet]]s, which then secrete growth factors such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), [[insulin-like growth factor]] 1–2 (IGF), PDGF, [[transforming growth factor]]-β (TGF-β), and [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF).<ref name=crovetti/>  Other treatments include implanting cultured keratinocytes into the wound to reepithelialize it and culturing and implanting fibroblasts into wounds.<ref name=Velander/><ref name=brem/>  Some patients are treated with [[artificial skin]] substitutes that have fibroblasts and keratinocytes in a matrix of collagen to replicate skin and release growth factors.
	
In other cases, skin from [[cadaver]]s is [[skin graft|grafted]] onto wounds, providing a cover to keep out bacteria and preventing the buildup of too much [[granulation tissue]], which can lead to excessive [[scar]]ring.  Though the [[allograft]] (skin transplanted from a member of the same [[species]]) is replaced by granulation tissue and is not actually incorporated into the healing wound, it encourages cellular proliferation and provides a structure for [[epithelial cell]]s to crawl across.<ref name=snyder/>  On the most difficult chronic wounds, allografts may not work, requiring skin grafts from elsewhere on the patient, which can cause pain and further stress on the patient’s system.<ref name=taylor/>  
	
Collagen dressings are another way to provide the matrix for cellular proliferation and migration, while also keeping the wound moist and absorbing exudate.<ref name=schon/>  Additionally Collagen has been shown to be chemotactic to human blood monocytes, which can enter the wound site and transform into beneficial wound-healing cells.<ref name=Chemotaxis>{{cite journal |doi=10.1084/jem.143.6.1299 |title=Collagen-and collagen peptide-induced chemotaxis of human blood monocytes |year=1976 |last1=Postlethwaite |first1=A. E. |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=143 |issue=6 |pages=1299–307 |pmid=1271012 |last2=Kang |first2=AH |pmc=2190221}}</ref> 
	
Since levels of [[Protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]]s are lowered in chronic wounds, some researchers are seeking ways to heal tissues by replacing these inhibitors in them.<ref name=Lai/>  [[Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor]] (SLPI), which inhibits not only proteases but also inflammation and microorganisms like [[virus]]es, bacteria, and [[fungus|fungi]], may prove to be an effective treatment.<ref name=Lai/>

Research into [[hormone]]s and wound healing has shown [[estrogen]] to speed wound healing in elderly humans and in animals that have had their [[ovary (animal)|ovaries]] removed, possibly by preventing excess neutrophils from entering the wound and releasing elastase.<ref name=kanda/> Thus the use of estrogen is a future possibility for treating chronic wounds.

==Epidemiology==

Chronic wounds mostly affect people over the age of 60.<ref name=Mustoe>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9610(03)00306-4 |title=Understanding chronic wounds: A unifying hypothesis on their pathogenesis and implications for therapy |year=2004 |last1=Mustoe |first1=Thomas |journal=The American Journal of Surgery |volume=187 |issue=5 |pages=S65 |pmid=15147994}}</ref>  
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is 0.78% of the population and the [[Prevalence (epidemiology)|prevalence]] ranges from 0.18 to 0.32%.<ref name=crovetti>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.transci.2004.01.004 |title=Platelet gel for healing cutaneous chronic wounds |year=2004 |last1=Crovetti |first1=Giovanni |last2=Martinelli |first2=Giovanna |last3=Issi |first3=Marwan |last4=Barone |first4=Marilde |last5=Guizzardi |first5=Marco |last6=Campanati |first6=Barbara |last7=Moroni |first7=Marco |last8=Carabelli |first8=Angelo |journal=Transfusion and Apheresis Science |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=145–51 |pmid=15062754}}</ref> As the population [[old age|ages]], the number of chronic wounds is expected to rise.<ref name=supp>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2004.07.023 |title=Engineered skin substitutes: Practices and potentials |year=2005 |last1=Supp |first1=Dorothy M. |last2=Boyce |first2=Steven T. |journal=Clinics in Dermatology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=403–12 |pmid=16023936}}</ref>
