'''''Molluscum contagiosum''''' ('''MC''') is a viral infection of the [[skin]] or occasionally of the [[mucous membranes]], sometimes called '''water warts'''.  It is caused by a DNA [[Poxviridae|poxvirus]] called the ''[[molluscum contagiosum virus]]'' (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] (infecting only humans). There are four types of MCV, MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults and often sexually transmitted.  This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children, sexually active adults, and those who are immunodeficient,<ref name="pmid12639455">{{cite journal |author=Hanson D, Diven DG |title=Molluscum contagiosum |journal=Dermatol.

CDC Molluscum Contagiosum|publisher= United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>  MC can affect any area of the skin but is most common on the trunk of the body, arms, and legs.  It is spread through direct contact or shared items such as clothing or towels.

The virus commonly spreads through skin-to-skin contact.<ref name="Athlete">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771922|last1=Likness|first1=LP|title=Common dermatologic infections in athletes and return-to-play guidelines.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|year=2011|month=June|volume=111|issue=6|pages=373–379|pmid=21771922}}</ref>  This includes sexual contact or touching or scratching the bumps and then touching the skin. Handling objects that have the virus on them ([[fomite]]s), such as a towel, can also result in infection. The virus can spread from one part of the body to another or to other people. The virus can be spread among children at day care or at school. Molluscum contagiosum is contagious until the bumps are gone (which, if untreated, may last up to 6 months or longer).

The time from infection to the appearance of lesions can range up to 6 months, with an average incubation period between 2 and 7 weeks.<ref name="pmid12639455"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Mollusca1klein.jpg|thumb|Molluscum lesions on an arm.]]
''Molluscum contagiosum'' lesions are flesh-colored, dome-shaped, and pearly in appearance.  They are often 1–5 millimeters in diameter, with a dimpled center.<ref name="Athlete"/> They are generally not painful, but they may itch or become irritated.  Picking or scratching the bumps may lead to further infection or scarring. In about 10% of the cases, [[eczema]] develops around the lesions.  They may occasionally be complicated by secondary bacterial infections. In some cases the dimpled section may bleed once or twice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The viral infection is limited to a localized area on the topmost layer of the epidermis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pamphlets: Molluscum Contagiosum |url=http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/viral_mollscum.html |year=2006 |publisher=American Academy of Dermatology |accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>  Once the virus-containing head of the lesion has been destroyed, the infection is gone.  The central waxy core contains the virus.  In a process called [[autoinoculation]], the virus may spread to neighboring skin areas.  Children are particularly susceptible to autoinoculation, and may have widespread clusters of lesions.

Individual molluscum lesions may go away on their own and are reported as lasting generally from 6 weeks,<ref name="pmid10591712">{{cite journal |author=Weller R, O'Callaghan CJ, MacSween RM, White MI |title=Scarring in molluscum contagiosum: comparison of physical expression and phenol ablation |journal=BMJ |volume=319 |issue=7224 |pages=1540|year=1999 |pmid=10591712 |doi= |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7224/1540 |pmc=28297}}</ref> to 3 months.<ref name="eMedicine">{{EMedicine|derm|270|Molluscum Contagiosum}}</ref> The lesions may propagate via [[autoinoculation]] so an outbreak generally lasts longer.

Diagnosis is made on the clinical appearance; the virus cannot routinely be cultured.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by excisional [[biopsy]].

Histologically, molluscum contagiosum is characterized by ''molluscume bodies'' in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] above the [[stratum basale]], which consist of large cells with:
* abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm (accumulated virons), and
* a small peripheral nucleus.

==Treatments==
Treatment options can often involve discomfort to the child so initial recommendations are often expectant management, simply waiting for the lesions to resolve spontaneously.<ref name="Prodigy">{{cite web | url=http://www.cks.nhs.uk/molluscum_contagiosum/management/scenario_molluscum_contagiosum#341804006 | title=Molluscum Contagiosum | accessdate=2010-04-20 | author=Prodigy knowledgebase | year=2003 | month=July | publisher=[[National Health Service]]}} - UK NHS guidelines on Molluscum Contagiosum</ref>
Current treatment options are invasive, requiring tissue destruction and attendant discomfort.

It should also be noted that treatments causing the skin on or near the lesions to rupture may spread the infection further, much the same as scratching does.<ref name="pmid16625612">{{cite journal |author=van der Wouden JC, Menke J, Gajadin S, ''et al.'' |title=Interventions for cutaneous molluscum contagiosum |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD004767 |year=2006 |pmid=16625612 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004767.pub2 |editor1-last=Van Der Wouden |editor1-first=Johannes C}}</ref>

Bumps located in the genital area may be treated in an effort to prevent them from spreading.<ref name="pmid14532898" /> When treatment has resulted in elimination of all bumps, the infection has been effectively cured and will not reappear unless the person is reinfected.<ref name="CDC"/>

===Medications===
[[Astringent]] chemicals applied to the surface of ''molluscum'' lesions to destroy successive layers of the skin include potassium hydrochloride, and [[cantharidin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Molluscum Contagiosum - Treatment Overview |url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/molluscum-contagiosum-treatment-overview |date=January 12, 2007 |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref>

Two randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials treating molluscum in children with a combination of essential oils have demonstrated the effectiveness in children with molluscum. The second, more recent study showed a 90% or greater reduction in the number of visible molluscum lesions in 16 of 19 children (84.2%) using a combination of essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) and organically bound iodine <ref>{{cite journal |author=Markum E, Baillie J |title=Combination of essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia and iodine in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in children |url=http://www.naturopathix.citymax.com/f/JDD.pdf |journal=J Drugs Dermatol.v|volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=349–54 |year=2012 |pmid=22395586}}</ref>
. Tea tree oil alone worked for only 18% of children.

[[Imiquimod]] may be used.<ref name="pmid17156002">{{cite journal |author=Hanna D, Hatami A, Powell J, ''et al.'' |title=A prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy and adverse effects of four recognized treatments of ''molluscum contagiosum'' in children |journal=Pediatric dermatology |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=574–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17156002 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1470.2006.00313.x}}</ref> Imiquimod is a form of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy triggers the [[immune system]] to fight the virus causing the skin growth. Imiquimod is applied 3 times per week, left on the skin for 6 to 10 hours, and washed off.

===Surgical treatment===
Surgical treatments include [[cryosurgery]], in which [[liquid nitrogen]] is used to freeze and destroy [[lesion]]s, as well as scraping them off with a [[curette]]. Application of liquid nitrogen may cause burning or stinging at the treated site, which may persist for a few minutes after the treatment. Scarring or loss of color can complicate both these treatments. With liquid nitrogen, a blister may form at the treatment site, but it will slough off in two to four weeks. Although its use is banned by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in the [[United States]] in its pure, undiluted form, the topical blistering agent [[cantharidin]] can be effective.<ref name=CantharidinMix>{{cite journal |author=Langley JM, Soder CM, Schlievert PM, Murray S |title=Case report: Molluscum contagiosum.

They may also leave scars and/or permanent white (depigmented) marks.

===Laser===
Pulsed [[dye laser]] therapy may be used for cases that are persistent and do not resolve following other measures.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=MH|coauthors=Moiin, A|title=Treatment of verrucae vulgaris and molluscum contagiosum with photodynamic therapy.|journal=Dermatologic clinics|date=2007 Jan|volume=25|issue=1|pages=75–80|pmid=17126744}}</ref> As of 2009 however there is no evidence for genital lesions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=M|coauthors=Paulson, C; Henry, SL|title=Treatment for anogenital molluscum contagiosum.|journal=American family physician|date=2009 Oct 15|volume=80|issue=8|pages=864|pmid=19835348}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==

Most cases of ''molluscum'' will clear up naturally within two years (usually within nine months).  So long as the skin growths are present, there is a possibility of transmitting the infection to another person.  When the growths are gone, the possibility for spreading the infection is ended.<ref name="CDC">{{cite web

Unlike [[herpes]] viruses, which can remain inactive in the body for months or years before reappearing, ''molluscum contagiosum'' does not remain in the body when the growths are gone from the skin and will not reappear on their own.<ref name="CDC"/> However, there is no permanent immunity to the virus, and it is possible to become infected again upon exposure to an infected person.

Advantage of treatment is to hasten the resolution of the virus.  This limits the size of the "pox" scar.  If left untreated, molluscum growth can reach sizes as large as a pea or a marble.  Spontaneous resolution of large lesions can occur, but will leave larger crater like growth.  As many treatment options are available, prognosis for minimal scarring is best if treatment is initiated while lesions are small.

==Epidemiology==

Approximately 122&nbsp;million people were affected by molluscum contagiosum as of 2010 (1.8% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>
