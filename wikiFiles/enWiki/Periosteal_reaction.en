A '''periosteal reaction''' is the formation of new [[bone]] in response to [[injury]] or other stimuli of the [[periosteum]] surrounding the [[bone]].<ref name="pmid15290554">{{cite journal |author=Ved N, Haller JO |title=Periosteal reaction with normal-appearing underlying bone: a child abuse mimicker |journal=Emerg Radiol |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=278–82 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=15290554 |doi=10.1007/s10140-002-0252-5 |url=}}</ref> It is most often identified on [[X-ray]] films of the bones.

==Etiology==
[[File:Triceratops lesions.jpg|thumb|Examples of periosteal reactive bone in selected specimens of ''[[Triceratops]]'']]
A periosteal reaction can result from a large number of causes, including injury and chronic irritation due to a medical condition such as [[hypertrophic osteopathy]], [[bone healing]] in response to [[Bone fracture|fracture]], [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[Stress fracture|stress injuries]], subperiosteal [[hematoma]]s, [[osteomyelitis]], and [[cancer]] of the bone. It may also occur as part of [[acropachy|thyroid acropachy]], a severe sign of the autoimmune thyroid disorder [[Grave's disease]].

Other causes include [[Menkes kinky hair syndrome]] and [[hypervitaminosis A]].<ref name="LovellWinter2006">{{cite book|author1=Wood W. Lovell|author2=Robert B. Winter|author3=Raymond T.

==Diagnosis==
The [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] appearance can be helpful in determining the cause of a periosteal reaction (for example, if other features of [[periostitis]] are present), but is usually not enough to be definitive.  [[Diagnosis]] can be helped by establishing if bone formation is localized to a specific point or generalized to a broad area. The appearance of the adjacent bone will give clues as to which of these is the most likely [[etiology|cause]].

Appearances include solid, laminated, spiculated, and [[Codman's triangle]].<ref name="Daffner2007">{{cite book|author=Richard H.
