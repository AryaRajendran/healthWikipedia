'''Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine''' ('''PCV''') is a [[pneumococcal vaccine]] used to protect [[infant]]s and young children against disease caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (pneumococcus). There are currently three PCV vaccines available on the global market: '''Prevnar''' (called Prevenar in some countries), '''Synflorix''' and '''Prevnar 13'''.  

'''Prevnar''' is a ''hepta''valent vaccine, meaning that it contains the [[cell membrane]] sugars of seven [[serotype]]s of pneumococcus, conjugated with [[Diphtheria]] [[proteins]]. It was manufactured by [[Wyeth]].<ref name="Wyeth_Prevnar_Product_Flyer">{{cite web|url=http://www.wyeth.com/content/ShowLabeling.asp?id=134|title=Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM<sub>197</sub> Protein)|publisher=Wyeth|year=2006}}</ref> In the [[United States]], vaccination with Prevnar is recommended for all children younger than 2 years, and for unvaccinated children between 24 and 59 months old who are at high risk for pneumococcal infections.<ref name="aap">{{cite journal |author= |title=American Academy of Pediatrics.

'''Synflorix''' is produced by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].  It is a ''deca''valent vaccine, meaning that it contains ten serotypes of pneumococcus (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) which are conjugated to a carrier protein.  Synflorix received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for use in the European Union in January 2009 <ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/opinion/Synflorix_1312009en.pdf EMEA Document]</ref> and GSK received European Commission authorization to market Synflorix in March 2009.<ref>[http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2009/2009_pressrelease_10039.htm GSK Release]</ref>  

'''Prevnar 13''' is produced by [[Pfizer]]. It is a tridecavalent vaccine, meaning that it contains thirteen serotypes of pneumococcus (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) which are conjugated to a carrier protein. Prevnar 13 was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] on February 24, 2010. <ref>http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm201758.htm</ref>  However, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has since stated that it will await the outcome of a trial under way in the Netherlands before deciding whether to recommend the drug for all adults aged 50 or older.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/22/us-pfizer-prevnar-idUSTRE81L2BS20120222 | work=Reuters | title=Prevnar trial results needed for CDC recommendation | date=February 22, 2012}}</ref>

==Production technique==
===Prevnar===
The original Prevnar was produced from the seven most prevalent strains of [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] [[bacteria]] in the US. The bacterial capsule sugars, a characteristic of these pathogens, are linked to CRM<sub>197</sub>, a nontoxic recombinant variant of [[diphtheria]] toxin ([[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]).

The vaccine's [[polysaccharide]] sugars are grown separately in soy peptone broths.  Through reductive amination, the sugars are directly conjugated to the protein carrier CRM<sub>197</sub> to form the glycoconjugate. CRM<sub>197</sub> is grown in Corynebacterium diphtheriae strain C7 in a medium of casamino acids and yeast extracts.[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/prevnar.htm]

The original 7-valent formulation contains serotypes 4,6B,9V,14,18C,19F, and 23F, and results in a 98% probability of protection against these strains, which caused 80% of the pneumococcal disease in infants in the US.  In 2010, Pfizer introduced Prevnar 13 which contains six additional strains (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 6A, 19A and 7F), which protect against the majority of the remaining pneumococcal infections.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Licensure of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and recommendations for use among children — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2010 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=258–61 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20224542 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5909a2.htm}}</ref>

===Synflorix===
Synflorix contains antigen from ten pneumococcal serotypes: the seven  that are contained in Prevnar, plus serotypes 1, 5, and 7F.  Eight of the ten serotypes are linked to a protein carrier derived from non-typeable [[Haemophilus influenzae]] strains.

==Schedule of vaccination==
As with all immunizations, whether it is available or required, and under what circumstances, varies according to the decisions made by local public health agencies.

Children under the age of two years fail to mount an adequate response to the 23-valent adult vaccine, and so the 7-valent '''Pneumococcal Conjugated Vaccine''' (PCV) (e.g. [[Prevnar]]) is used.  Whilst this covers only seven strains out of more than ninety strains, these seven strains cause 80% to 90% of cases of severe pneumococcal disease, and it is considered to be nearly 100% effective against these strains.<!--

===United Kingdom===
The [[vaccination_schedule#UK|UK childhood vaccination schedule]] consists of a primary course of two doses at 2 and 4 months of age with a final third dose aged 13 months.<ref name="greenbook"/>

Children at special risk (e.g., [[sickle cell disease]] and [[asplenia]]) require as full protection as can be achieved using the 7-valent congugated vaccine, with the more extensive 23-valent vaccine given after the second year of life:

===United States===
In 2001, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC), upon advice from its [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]], recommended the vaccine be administered to every infant and young child in the US. The resulting demand outstripped production, creating shortages not resolved until 2004. All children, according to current US [[vaccination schedule]]s, should receive four doses, at two months, four months, six months, and again between one year and fifteen months of age.

==Efficacy==
Prevnar is designed to stop seven of about ninety pneumococcal serotypes which have the potential to cause invasive [[pneumococcal disease]].  Each year, IPD kills approximately one million children worldwide.[http://www.slate.com/id/2168854/pagenum/all/]  Since approval, Prevnar's [[vaccine efficacy|efficacy]] in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease has been documented by a number of [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] studies.<ref name="pmid12724479">{{cite journal |author=Whitney CG, Farley MM, Hadler J, ''et al.'' |title=Decline in invasive pneumococcal disease after the introduction of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=348 |issue=18 |pages=1737–46 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12724479 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa022823 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid16609088">{{cite journal |author=Poehling KA, Talbot TR, Griffin MR, ''et al.'' |title=Invasive pneumococcal disease among infants before and after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=295 |issue=14 |pages=1668–74 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16609088 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.14.1668 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid17071283">{{cite journal |author=Whitney CG, Pilishvili T, Farley MM, ''et al.'' |title=Effectiveness of seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against invasive pneumococcal disease: a matched case-control study |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9546 |pages=1495–502 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17071283 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69637-2 |url=}}</ref>  There is evidence that other people in the same household as a vaccinee also become relatively protected.<ref>{{cite journal

In fact, there is evidence that routine childhood vaccination reduces the burden of pneumococcal disease in adults and especially high-risk adults, such as those living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].<ref name="Siemieniuk 2011">{{cite journal|last=Siemieniuk|first=Reed A.C.|coauthors= Gregson, Dan B.; Gill, M.

The vaccine is, however, primarily developed for the U.S. and European epidemiological situation, and therefore it has
only a limited coverage of serotypes causing serious pneumococcal infections in most developing countries.<ref name="pmid17324490">{{cite journal |author=Barocchi MA, Censini S, Rappuoli R |title=Vaccines in the era of genomics: the pneumococcal challenge |journal=Vaccine |volume=25 |issue=16 |pages=2963–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17324490 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.01.065}}</ref>

==Evidence supporting addition to routine vaccination schedules==

After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States.  One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those age less than 2 years of age.<ref name="pmid12724479"/>  By 2004, all-cause pneumonia admission rates had declined by 39% (95% CI 22–52) and rates of hospitalizations for pneumococcal meningitis decreased by 66% (95% CI 56.3-73.5) in children younger than 2.<ref name="pmid17416262">{{cite journal |author=Grijalva CG, Nuorti JP, Arbogast PG, Martin SW, Edwards KM, Griffin MR |title=Decline in pneumonia admissions after routine childhood immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the USA: a time-series analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9568 |pages=1179–86 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17416262 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60564-9 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid18433334">{{cite journal |author=Tsai CJ, Griffin MR, Nuorti JP, Grijalva CG |title=Changing epidemiology of pneumococcal meningitis after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the United States |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1664–72 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18433334 |doi=10.1086/587897 |url=}}</ref>

Interestingly, rates of invasive pneumococcal disease among adults has also declined since the introduction of the vaccine.<ref name="pmid12724479"/><ref name="pmid18433334"/> However, it is more difficult to specifically attribute this decline in adults to the childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccine since the adult pneumococcal 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine is also available.
  
While an overall decline in invasive pneumococcal disease is well documented, concerns have been raised regarding a potential increase in the rate of infections caused by serotypes not covered in the vaccine.  Recent data suggest that serotype replacement is increasing (1.61- and 1.28-fold increase in children and adults) but remains minimal when compared to the significant reduction observed in the burden of this vaccine-preventable disease.<ref name="pmid17516400">{{cite journal |author=Albrich WC, Baughman W, Schmotzer B, Farley MM |title=Changing characteristics of invasive pneumococcal disease in Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, after introduction of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=1569–76 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17516400 |doi=10.1086/518149 |url=}}</ref>

==Clinical study==
Prevnar was administered to nearly 20,000 children prior to licensure, and the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] were evaluated. Rashes at the site of injection were noted in about one percent of children.

==Sales==
Prevnar was among Wyeth's top revenue producers, with sales in 2005 of $1.5 billion, up 43 percent from 2004.[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=78193&p=irol-sec Wyeth Annual report]

==Controversy==
Controversy surrounded pneumococcal vaccine advertisements aired by Wyeth in Poland and Saudi Arabia.  A television commercial for Prevnar, showing a dying child and its mother, was banned in Poland by the main pharmaceutical inspector (GIF), Zofia Ulz, on April 3, 2007.  According to Ulz, the ad was designed to provoke fear to attract customers.  Wyeth responded by asserting the tactic was used to increase awareness of the potential danger represented by pneumococcal infections.<ref name="titleControversial pneumococcal vaccine ad - Polish Market News">{{cite web |url=http://www.polishmarket.com/next.php?id=48543 |title=Controversial pneumococcal vaccine ad - Polish Market News |accessdate=2008-02-20 |format= |work=}}</ref>

In addition, Wyeth was accused of conflict of interest in economic evaluations of Prevnar.<ref name="pmid15308354">{{cite journal |author=Beutels P |title=Potential conflicts of interest in vaccine economics research: a commentary with a case study of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination |journal=Vaccine |volume=22 |issue=25–26 |pages=3312–22 |year=2004 |pmid=15308354 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.03.001}}</ref>

Authorities in the Netherlands banned use of one batch of Pfizer's Prevenar after three infants died within two weeks of receiving the anti-infection vaccination. A [[Pfizer]] spokeswoman said that the three infants also received two unrelated other vaccines as part of routine immunizations. The [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] was investigating the cause of the infants' deaths. Other batches of Prevenar will continue to be used. The Pfizer spokeswoman said preliminary investigations by the company and health authorities had found no link between the vaccinations and the deaths and that the company initiated the "quarantine" of the batch which contained 110,000 doses of Prevenar.[http://web.archive.org/web/20091109191848/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33671008/ns/health-infectious_diseases/]

Concerns about serotype replacement have been circulating since the CDC published a study in 2006 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16267772]  More recently, it was confirmed that children vaccinated with 7-valent PCV pneumococcal conjugate vaccine showed an increased rate of carriage of serotype 19A: a new, more virulent and less treatable (antibiotic resistant) strain.  The study showed that the increased carriage rates were dose-dependent.  Healthy infants were vaccinated with three doses, two doses, or were unvaccinated for PCV.
