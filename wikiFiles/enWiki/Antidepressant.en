'''Antidepressants''' are [[drugs]] used for the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Despite their name, they are often used to treat a wide range of other conditions, on- or [[off-label]], such as [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]], [[neuropathic pain]], and some hormone-mediated disorders such as [[dysmenorrhea]], and for [[snoring]], [[migraines]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[substance abuse]], and occasionally even [[insomnia]] or other [[sleep disorder]]s. They can be used both alone or combination with other medications. Most antidepressants have a delayed onset of action (2–6 weeks) but for those who respond well to a given drug, some degree of efficacy is often seen after one week.

Many off-label or recreational drugs can produce an antidepressant effect, but their use is controversial. [[Opioids]] were used to treat major depression until the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Gyula |last1=Nyírő |year=1962 |title=Psychiatria |language=Hungarian |location=Budapest |publisher=Medicina Könyvkiadó |oclc=660462833}}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}</ref> [[Amphetamine]]s were used until the mid-1960s.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Scant research on the use of opioids limit their use for the treatment of depression, whereas amphetamines have found a thriving market for conditions as widely arrayed as [[attention deficit disorder]], [[narcolepsy]], and [[obesity]], and continue to be studied for myriad applications. 

Both opioids and amphetamines induce a therapeutic response very quickly, showing results within twenty-four to forty-eight hours; the [[therapeutic ratio]]s for both opioids and amphetamines are greater than those of the tricyclic antidepressants. In a small study published in 1995, the opioid [[buprenorphine]] was shown to have potential for treating severe, [[treatment-resistant depression]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-199502000-00008 |title=Buprenorphine Treatment of Refractory Depression |year=1995 |last1=Bodkin |first1=J.

Low dose [[antipsychotics]] are also sometimes used,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0512 |title=Conventional Antipsychotic Prescription in Unipolar Depression, I |year=2003 |last1=Vega |first1=Jason A.

==History==
[[Image:Saint johns wart flowers.jpg|thumb|[[St John's wort]]]]

Before the 1950s, opioids and [[amphetamine]]s were commonly used as antidepressants.  Their use was later restricted due to their addictive nature and side-effects.<ref name="Weber 1988 255–66">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004850-198807000-00007 |title=Current and Historical Concepts of Opiate Treatment in Psychiatric Disorders |year=1988 |last1=Weber |first1=Matthias M |last2=Emrich |first2=Hinderk M |journal=International Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=255–66 |pmid=3153713}}</ref> Extracts from the herb [[St John's wort]] had been used as a "nerve tonic" to alleviate depression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pauz.200390062 |title=Kulturgeschichte und Mystik des Johanniskrauts: Vom 2500 Jahre alten Apotropaikum zum aktuellen Antidepressivum |year=2003 |last1=Czygan |first1=Franz-C. |journal=Pharmazie in unserer Zeit |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=184–90 |pmid=12784538 |trans_title=From a 2500 year old apotropic comes a current antidepressive.

===Isoniazid, iproniazid, and imipramine===
In 1951, [[Irving Selikoff]] and Edward Robitzek, working out of Sea View Hospital on [[Staten Island]], began clinical trials on two new [[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted "a subtle general stimulation... the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems."<ref name="pmid14906149">{{cite journal |doi=10.1378/chest.21.4.385 |title=Tuberculosis Chemotherapy with Hydrazine Derivatives of Isonicotinic Acid |year=1952 |last1=Selikoff |first1=Irving J. |journal=CHEST Journal |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=385–438 |pmid=14906149 |last2=Robitzek |first2=EH}}</ref> The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press. 

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side-effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to describe its action.<ref name="isbn0-88048-397-0">{{cite book |last=Healy |first=D |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=MM |title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC |accessdate=2009-05-28 |year=2001 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-0-88048-397-1 |pages=10–1 |chapter=The Antidepressant Drama |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}</ref> A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952, before Lurie and Salzer, Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported the positive effect of isoniazid on depressed patients.<ref name="Healy96">{{cite book |last=Healy |first=David |title=The psychopharmacologists: interviews |accessdate=2009-05-28 |year=1996 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |isbn=978-1-86036-008-4 |page=8}}</ref> For reasons unrelated to its efficacy, isoniazid as an antidepressant was soon overshadowed by the more toxic iproniazid,<ref name="isbn0-88048-397-0"/> although it remains a mainstay of [[tuberculosis treatment]]. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of [[diamine oxidase]], coupled with a weak inhibition of [[monoamine oxidase A]].<ref name="isbn1-86036-010-6">{{Cite book |last=Healy |first=David |title=The Psychopharmacologists: Volume 2 |publisher=A Hodder Arnold Publication |year=1998 |pages=132–4 |isbn=978-1-86036-010-7}}</ref>

Selikoff and Robitzek also experimented with another anti-tuberculosis, [[iproniazid]]; it showed a greater psychostimulant effect, but more pronounced toxicity.<ref name="pmid12998444">{{cite journal |doi=10.1378/chest.23.1.1 |title=Isoniazid and Its Isopropyl Derivative in the Therapy of Tuberculosis in Humans: Comparative Therapeutic and Toxicologic Properties |year=1953 |last1=Robitzek |first1=Edward H. |journal=CHEST Journal |volume=23 |pages=1–15 |pmid=12998444 |last2=Selikoff |first2=IJ |last3=Mamlok |first3=E |last4=Tendlau |first4=A |issue=1}}</ref> Later, Jackson Smith, Gordon Kamman, George Crane, and [[Frank Ayd]], described the psychiatric applications of iproniazid.

The antidepressant effect of a [[tricyclic]], a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. [[Antihistamine]] derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as neuroleptics. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as [[sedatives]] and [[antipsychotics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn, in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[Pharmaceutical Company]], discovered that compound "G 22355", later renamed [[imipramine]].  Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and motor retardation. Kuhn described his new compound as a "thymoleptic" "taking hold of the emotions," in contrast with neuroleptics, "taking hold of the nerves" in 1955-56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13583250 |year=1958 |last1=Kuhn |first1=R |title=The treatment of depressive states with G 22355 (imipramine hydrochloride) |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=459–64 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref>

===Second generation antidepressants===
Antidepressants became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers,<ref>http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm{{full|date=March 2013}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref> which were being marketed for different uses.<ref name="3faces">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005053-199903000-00007 |title=The Three Faces of the Antidepressants: A Critical Commentary on the Clinical-Economic Context of Diagnosis |year=1999 |last1=Healy |first1=David |journal=The Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease |volume=187 |issue=3 |pages=174–80 |pmid=10086474}}</ref> Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced. The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) increased after the development and introduction of "reversible" forms affecting only the MAO-A subtype of inhibitors, making this drug safer to use.<ref name="3faces"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02041242 |title=The discovery of antidepressants: A winding path |year=1991 |last1=Pletscher |first1=A. |journal=Experientia |volume=47 |pages=4–8 |pmid=1999242 |issue=1}}</ref>

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit [[norepinephrine]] [[reuptake]].  However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects.  Later tricyclics were thought to affect [[serotonin]] as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was [[zimelidine]] in 1971, while the first released clinically was [[indalpine]]. [[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI. Fluoxetine was developed at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the early 1970s by Bryan Molloy, [[Klaus Schmiegel]], David Wong and others.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10511010 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10511010 |year=1999 |last1=Domino |first1=EF |title=History of modern psychopharmacology: A personal view with an emphasis on antidepressants |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=591–8 |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1151730 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1151730 |year=1975 |last1=Wong |first1=DT |last2=Bymaster |first2=FP |last3=Horng |first3=JS |last4=Molloy |first4=BB |title=A new selective inhibitor for uptake of serotonin into synaptosomes of rat brain: 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy).

[[St John's wort]] fell out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, except in [[Germany]], where [[Hypericum]] extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed.

==Classes of antidepressants==
For a more complete list of antidepressants, see {{Main|List of antidepressants}}

===Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors===
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], [[SSRI]]s are thought to prevent the reuptake of serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) by the presynaptic neuron, thus initially maintaining higher levels of 5-HT in the synapse. Like all anti-depressants their mechanism of action remains unknown. 

SSRI antidepressants includes:
* [[Citalopram]] (Celexa)
* [[Escitalopram]] (Lexapro, Cipralex)
* [[Paroxetine]] (Paxil, Seroxat)
* [[Fluoxetine]] (Prozac)
* [[Fluvoxamine]] (Luvox)
* [[Sertraline]] (Zoloft, Lustral)

===Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===
[[Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs) inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. The NRIs include:
* [[Atomoxetine]] (Strattera)
* [[Reboxetine]] (Edronax)
* [[Viloxazine]] (Vivalan)

===Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSA)===
[[Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants]] [[NaSSA]] inhibit reuptake of serotonin, and noradrenaline at the presynaptic alpha-2 [[adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsforum.com/imagebank/item/Drug_nassa/default.aspx |title=The mechanism of action of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs) |publisher=CNSforum |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>  Examples include:
* [[Mianserin]] (Tolvon)
* [[Mirtazapine]] (Remeron, Avanza, Zispin)

===Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===
[[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) inhibit reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.  These include:
* [[Desvenlafaxine]] (Pristiq)
* [[Duloxetine]] (Cymbalta)
* [[Milnacipran]] (Ixel, Savella)
* [[Venlafaxine]] (Effexor)

===Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors===
The [[Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor]]s (SARIs) include:
* [[Etoperidone]] (Axiomin, Etonin)
* [[Nefazodone]] (Serzone, Nefadar)
* [[Trazodone]] (Desyrel)

===Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors===
[[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s inhibit the neuronal reuptake of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/PCC.v06n0403 |title=A Review of the Neuropharmacology of Bupropion, a Dual Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor |year=2004 |last1=Stahl |first1=Stephen M. |last2=Pradko |first2=James F. |last3=Haight |first3=Barbara R. |last4=Modell |first4=Jack G. |last5=Rockett |first5=Carol B. |last6=Learned-Coughlin |first6=Susan |journal=The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=06 |issue=4 |pages=159–166 |pmid=15361919 |pmc=514842}}</ref> These include:
* [[Bupropion]] (Wellbutrin, Zyban)

===Selective serotonin reuptake enhancers===
* [[Tianeptine]] (Stablon, Coaxil, Tatinol)
* [[Amineptine]]

===Norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitors===
[[Norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitor]]s (NDDIs) act by antagonizing the serotonin [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]], which normally acts to inhibit norepinephrine and dopamine release, thereby promoting outflow of these neurotransmitters.
* [[Agomelatine]] (Valdoxan, Melitor, Thymanax)

===Tricyclic antidepressants===
[[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s block the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

The tricyclics include:

'''Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants''':
* [[Amitriptyline]] (Elavil, Endep)
* [[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil)
* [[Doxepin]] (Adapin, Sinequan)
* [[Imipramine]] (Tofranil)
* [[Trimipramine]] (Surmontil)

'''Secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants'''
* [[Desipramine]] (Norpramin)
* [[Nortriptyline]] (Pamelor, Aventyl, Noritren)
* [[Protriptyline]] (Vivactil)

===Monoamine oxidase inhibitor===
Irreversible [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which breaks down the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. As there are potentially fatal interactions between this class of medication and certain foods (particularly those containing [[tyramine]]), as well as certain drugs, classic MAOIs are rarely prescribed any more. However, this does not apply to [[Emsam]], the [[transdermal patch]] form of [[selegiline]], which due to its bypassing of the stomach has a lesser propensity to induce such events.<ref name=Cascade01>{{cite journal |first1=Elisa F. |last1=Cascade |first2=Amir H. |last2=Kalali |first3=Sheldon H. |last3=Preskorn |pmid=20711332 |url=http://www.psychiatrymmc.com/emsam-the-first-year/ |year=2007 |title=Emsam: The first year |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=19–21 |pmc=2921248 |journal=Psychiatry}}</ref>
* [[Isocarboxazid]] (Marplan)
* [[Moclobemide]] (Aurorix, Manerix)
* [[Phenelzine]] (Nardil)
* [[Pirlindole]] (Pirazidol)
* [[Selegiline]] (Eldepryl, Emsam)
* [[Tranylcypromine]] (Parnate)

===Nicotine===
Nicotine is believed to act as an antidepressant,<ref name="pmid19293201">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1753465809102662 |title=Smoking and depression: Is smoking cessation effective? |year=2009 |last1=Ischaki |first1=E. |last2=Gratziou |first2=C. |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease |volume=3 |pages=31–8 |pmid=19293201 |issue=1}}</ref> by stimulating the release of dopamine and norepinephrine; additionally, nicotine is believed to exert an antidepressant effect due to the desensitisation of nicotinic receptors which occurs as a result of tolerance.<ref name="pmid18834313">{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094742 |title=Pharmacology of Nicotine: Addiction, Smoking-Induced Disease, and Therapeutics |year=2009 |last1=Benowitz |first1=Neal L. |journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology |volume=49 |pages=57–71 |pmid=18834313 |pmc=2946180}}</ref> Clinical trials have demonstrated nicotine (administered using a dermal [[nicotine patch]]) exerts an antidepressant effect in both depressed nonsmokers and smokers, and can be considered for treatment-resistant depression. The proposed mechanism of chronic nicotine causing desensitisation of nicotinic receptors, thereby leading to an antidepressant effect, is consistent with the theory first proposed over 30 years ago and subsequent research that confirmed excessive acetylcholine activity in the brain leads to depressive symptoms. [[Varenicline]], a nicotinic receptor-acting drug used to wean people off of nicotine dependence has also demonstrated antidepressant properties.<ref name="pmid20965579">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2010.09.004 |title=Nicotine receptors and depression: Revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis |year=2010 |last1=Mineur |first1=Yann S. |last2=Picciotto |first2=Marina R. |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=580–6 |pmid=20965579 |pmc=2991594}}</ref>

===Caffeine===
Individuals who use [[caffeine]], at moderate doses (fewer than 6 cups of coffee per day), have a reduced incidence of depressive symptoms and an overall reduced risk of [[suicide]]. Anxiety is an important side effect of caffeine which occurs more commonly in individuals who suffer from [[panic disorder]] or [[social phobia]] or when caffeine is taken in excessive amounts.<ref name="pmid20164571">{{cite journal |doi=10.3233/JAD-2010-1378 |doi_brokendate=March 19, 2013 |first1=Diogo R. |last1=Lara |title=Caffeine, Mental Health, and Psychiatric Disorders |journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease |pmid=20164571 |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=1387-2877&volume=20%20Suppl%201&issue=&spage=S239 |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S239–48}}</ref>

===Adjunct medication===
Other medications are used to "augment" the effect of antidepressants with mixed results.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&alt=sh#v1028590 |work=Merck Manual |title=Depressive Disorders |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>  Some of the drugs used include

[[Psychostimulants]] such as
* [[amphetamine]] (Adderall)
* [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin)
* [[modafinil]] (Provigil, Alertec)

Modafinil is unique in its effect on sleep; it increases alertness and reduces drowsiness while the patient is active, but does not inhibit normal sleep. Extreme caution must be used, however, with certain populations. Stimulants are known to trigger manic episodes in people suffering from bipolar disorder. Close supervision of those with substance abuse disorders is urged. Emotionally labile patients should avoid stimulants, as they exacerbate mood shifting. <!-- reverted edit from 'liable' back to 'labile', however unless 'labile' has specific meaning within this context, may be worth changing to the more common 'unstable' --> A review article published in 2007 found psychostimulants "may" be effective in treatment-resistant depression with concomitant antidepressant therapy. A more certain conclusion could not be drawn due to substantial deficiencies in the studies available for consideration, and the "somewhat" contradictory nature of their results. However, the authors claim psychostimulants are likely to have a higher level of clinical effectiveness under circumstances in which the patient will probably die soon, so rapid relief is of great importance. In this situation, the patient is likely to die before dependence on, or tolerance of, the medication interferes with their care.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00023210-200721030-00004 |title=Psychostimulants in the Treatment of Depression |year=2007 |last1=Orr |first1=Katy |last2=Taylor |first2=David |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=239–57 |pmid=17338594}}</ref>
* nicotine

Chronic nicotine intake via nicotine patches results in an increased response to standard antidepressants. Similarly [[varenicline]] has been shown to augment subtherapeutic dose levels of SSRIs to produce an antidepressant effect.<ref name="pmid20965579"/>
* lithium

[[Lithium pharmacology|Lithium]] remains the standard treatment for bipolar disorder and is often used in conjunction with other medications. Lithium's potential side effects include thirst, [[tremor]]s, light-headedness, [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]].  Long term use is associated with kidney failure.

Anticonvulsants are also used, particularly in bipolar disorder.  They include:
* [[carbamazepine]] (Tegretol)
* [[sodium valproate]] (Epilim, Depakote)
* [[lamotrigine]] (Lamictal)
* [[clonazepam]] (Klonopin)
* [[oxcarbazepine]] (Trileptal)
Benzodiazepines also play a prominent role in the treatment of bipolar disorder.<ref>{{cite book |last=Papalos |first=Demetri and Janice |title=The Bipolar Child |year=2002 |publisher=Broadway |location=New York |isbn=0-7679-1285-3}}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}</ref>  The are used to counteract the often nervous or "jittery" effects of psychostimulant medications can produce. For example a common side effect of Prozac is [[insomnia]] thus a tranquilizer such as [[Valium]] maybe prescribe to offset this effect. Additionally, benzodiazepines have been proven to augment and compliment the effects of antidepressants giving the patient the optimum results of the drug.<ref>{{cite web |title=Drug interactions between Prozac and Valium |url=http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/prozac-with-valium-1115-648-862-441.html |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref> Due to their potential for dependency however most patients over the course of their treatment take benzodiazepines on an "as needed" (PRN) basis.

The most commonly used benzodiazepines are:
* [[diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[clonazepam]] (Klonopin)
* [[lorazepam]] (Ativan)
* [[alprazolam]] (Xanax)
* [[temazepam]] (Restoril)

===Alternative therapies===

====Herbalism====
St. John's wort is by far the most widely-used and well-studied herbal antidepressant. A number of other herbs have been used traditionally to treat depression and related ailments like anxiety, but the research on most of these treatments is sparse.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In a small (30-patient), double-blind, randomized clinical trial, [[saffron]] (''Crocus sativus L.'') was to be equally effective with imipramine for treating mild to moderate depression.  However, no other researchers have confirmed these results, nor has a larger population study been published.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-4-12 |year=2004 |last1=Akhondzadeh |first1=Shahin |last2=Fallah-Pour |first2=Hasan |last3=Afkham |first3=Khosro |last4=Jamshidi |first4=Amir-Hossein |last5=Khalighi-Cigaroudi |first5=Farahnaz |journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=4 |pages=12 |pmid=15341662 |title=Comparison of Crocus sativus L.

Several plants in the ''Salvia'' genus have been studied for antidepressant properties, although most of the research conducted so far has only been from mice and rat studies.  ''[[Salvia elegans]]'', also known as pineapple sage, is widely used in Mexican traditional medicine, and has been found in single study in mice to have antidepressant and antianxiety properties.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.003 |title=Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of hydroalcoholic extract from Salvia elegans |year=2006 |last1=Herrera-Ruiz |first1=Maribel |last2=García-Beltrán |first2=Yolanda |last3=Mora |first3=Sergio |last4=Díaz-Véliz |first4=Gabriela |last5=Viana |first5=Glauce S.B. |last6=Tortoriello |first6=Jaime |last7=Ramírez |first7=Guillermo |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=107 |pages=53–8 |pmid=16530995 |issue=1}}</ref>  ''[[Salvia sclarea]]'', also known as clary, is known to have an antidepressant-like effect in rats, which is thought to be explained by modulation of dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.035 |title=Antidepressant-like effect of Salvia sclarea is explained by modulation of dopamine activities in rats |year=2010 |last1=Seol |first1=Geun Hee |last2=Shim |first2=Hyun Soo |last3=Kim |first3=Pill-Joo |last4=Moon |first4=Hea Kyung |last5=Lee |first5=Ki Ho |last6=Shim |first6=Insop |last7=Suh |first7=Suk Hyo |last8=Min |first8=Sun Seek |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=130 |pages=187–90 |pmid=20441789 |issue=1}}</ref>

====Nutrition====
Poor [[nutrition]] has been proposed as a risk factor for developing depression. In a study of older adults, poor nutrition was a strong predictor of depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10443862 |year=1999 |last1=Boult |first1=C |last2=Krinke |first2=UB |last3=Urdangarin |first3=CF |last4=Skarin |first4=V |title=The validity of nutritional status as a marker for future disability and depressive symptoms among high-risk older adults |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=995–9 |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society}}</ref>

[[Omega 3 fatty acids]] have been proposed as a treatment for depression, alone or in combination with other treatments. One small pilot study of childhood depression (ages six to 12) suggested omega 3 fatty acids may have therapeutic benefits for treating childhood depression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.6.1098 |title=Omega-3 Treatment of Childhood Depression: A Controlled, Double-Blind Pilot Study |year=2006 |last1=Nemets |first1=H. |last2=Nemets |first2=B. |last3=Apter |first3=A. |last4=Bracha |first4=Z. |last5=Belmaker |first5=R.H. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=6 |pages=1098–100 |pmid=16741212}}</ref>  A 2005 review article included double-blind studies, randomized control trials, epidemiological studies linking omega 3 fatty acids consumption and depression found that low fish consumption (the primary source of omega 3 fatty acids) correlated to increased rates of depression, and case-control and cohort studies of unipolar and postpartum depression indicating low blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in depressed patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2005.11.005 |title=Ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: A review of the evidence and a methodological critique |year=2006 |last1=Sontrop |first1=Jessica |last2=Campbell |first2=M. Karen |journal=Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |pages=4–13 |pmid=16337677 |issue=1}}</ref> 

A 2008 review of clinical studies of the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids on depression has shown somewhat inconsistent results: "Of the evaluated studies, 13 showed a significant positive association between omega-3 and depression, while six studies did not show a relationship between the referred variables."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1586/ern.10.77 |title=What is the effectiveness of the use of polyunsaturated fatty acid omega-3 in the treatment of depression? |year=2010 |last1=Rocha Araujo |first1=Daniele Marano |last2=Vilarim |first2=Marina Machado |last3=Nardi |first3=Antonio E |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1117–29 |pmid=20586692}}</ref> To be read with caution because of limited data, a 2008 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane]] systematic review found in the one eligible study that omega 3 fatty acids are an effective adjunctive therapy for depressed but not manic symptoms in [[bipolar disorder]]. The authors found an "acute need" for more randomised, controlled trials.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005169.pub2 |title=Omega-3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2008 |last1=Montgomery |first1=Paul |last2=Richardson |first2=Alexandra J |editor1-last=Montgomery |editor1-first=Paul |pmid=18425912 |issue=2 |pages=CD005169}}</ref>

==Mechanisms of Action==
For depression, the mechanism of action of antidepressants is unknown.

===Neurogenic Adaptations===
The neurogenic hypothesis states that molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of adult [[neurogenesis]] is required for remission from depression and that neurogenesis is mediated by the action of antidepressants.<ref name="pmid16425236">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hipo.20156 |title=Hippocampal neurogenesis: Opposing effects of stress and antidepressant treatment |year=2006 |last1=Warner-Schmidt |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Duman |first2=Ronald S. |journal=Hippocampus |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=239–49 |pmid=16425236}}</ref> Chronic use of antidepressant increased [[neurogenesis]] in the [[hippocampus]] of rats.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Jessica E. |last1=Malberg |first2=Amelia J. |last2=Eisch |first3=Eric J. |last3=Nestler |first4=Ronald S. |last4=Duman |title=Chronic Antidepressant Treatment Increases Neurogenesis in Adult Rat Hippocampus |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=11124987 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11124987 |year=2000 |volume=20 |issue=24 |pages=9104–10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(00)00904-3 |title=Antidepressants alter cell proliferation in the adult brain in vivo and in neural cultures in vitro |year=2001 |last1=Manev |first1=Hari |last2=Uz |first2=Tolga |last3=Smalheiser |first3=Neil R |last4=Manev |first4=Radmila |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=411 |pages=67–70 |pmid=11137860 |issue=1–2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.euroneuro.2006.01.007 |title=Proteomic analysis of rat hippocampus and frontal cortex after chronic treatment with fluoxetine or putative novel antidepressants: CRF1 and NK1 receptor antagonists |year=2006 |last1=Carboni |first1=Lucia |last2=Vighini |first2=Miriam |last3=Piubelli |first3=Chiara |last4=Castelletti |first4=Laura |last5=Milli |first5=Alberto |last6=Domenici |first6=Enrico |journal=European Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=521–37 |pmid=16517129}}</ref> Other animal research suggests that long term drug-induced antidepressants effects modulate the expression of genes mediated by [[circadian rhythm|clock genes]], possibly by regulating the expression of a second set of genes (i.e. clock-controlled genes).<ref name="Uz">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.05.003 |title=Effect of fluoxetine and cocaine on the expression of clock genes in the mouse hippocampus and striatum |year=2005 |last1=Uz |first1=T. |last2=Ahmed |first2=R. |last3=Akhisaroglu |first3=M. |last4=Kurtuncu |first4=M. |last5=Imbesi |first5=M. |last6=Dirim Arslan |first6=A. |last7=Manev |first7=H. |journal=Neuroscience |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=1309–16 |pmid=15994025}}</ref>

The delayed onset of clinical effects from antidepressants indicates involvement of adaptive changes in antidepressant effects. Rodent studies have consistently shown upregulation of the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|3, 5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) system induced by different types of chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment, including serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and electroconvulsions. cAMP is synthesized from [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine 5-triphosphate]] (ATP) by adenylyl cyclase and metabolized by cyclic nucleotide [[phosphodiesterase]]s (PDEs).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00213-005-0055-y |title=Interaction between the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of beta adrenergic agonists and the cyclic AMP PDE inhibitor rolipram in rats |year=2005 |last1=Zhang |first1=Han-Ting |last2=Huang |first2=Ying |last3=Mishler |first3=Kathleen |last4=Roerig |first4=Sandra C. |last5=O'Donnell |first5=James M. |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=182 |pages=104–15 |pmid=16010541 |issue=1}}</ref>

===Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis===
One manifestation of depression is an altered [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) that resembles the neuro-endocrine ([[cortisol]]) response to [[Stress (biological)|stress]], that of increased cortisol production and a subsequent impaired negative feedback mechanism. It is not know whether this HPA axis disregulation is reactive or causative for depression.  This briefing suggest that the mode of action of antidepressants may be in regulating HPA axis function.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12834443 |year=2003 |last1=Pariante |first1=CM |title=Depression, stress and the adrenal axis |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=811–2 |journal=Journal of neuroendocrinology |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2826.2003.01058.x}}</ref>

===Monomine Hypothesis===
In 1965, Joseph Schildkraut postulated the [[Monoamine Hypothesis]] when he posited an association between low levels of neurotransmitters and depression.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8555758 |year=1995 |last1=Schildkraut |first1=JJ |title=The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: A review of supporting evidence. 1965 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=524–33; discussion 523–4 |journal=The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences}}</ref>  By 1985, the monoamine hypothesis was mostly dismissed until it was revived with the introduction of SSRIs through the successful direct-to-consumer advertising, often revolving around the claim that SSRIs correct a chemical imbalance caused by a lack of serotonin within the brain.

To date, there is no evidence to support serotonin dysfunction in the pathophysiology of this disorder.

Serotonin levels in human brain is measured indirectly by sampling cerebrospinal fluid for its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid, or by measuring the serotonin precursor, tryptophan. In one placebo controlled study funded by the National Institute of Health, tryptophan depletion was achieved, but they did not observe the anticipated depressive response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.euroneuro.2009.10.003 |title=CSF neurochemicals during tryptophan depletion in individuals with remitted depression and healthy controls |year=2010 |last1=Moreno |first1=Francisco A. |last2=Parkinson |first2=Damian |last3=Palmer |first3=Craig |last4=Castro |first4=Wm.

Although there is evidence that antidepressants inhibit the reuptake of serotonin,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9786305 |year=1998 |last1=Murphy |first1=DL |last2=Andrews |first2=AM |last3=Wichems |first3=CH |last4=Li |first4=Q |last5=Tohda |first5=M |last6=Greenberg |first6=B |title=Brain serotonin neurotransmission: An overview and update with an emphasis on serotonin subsystem heterogeneity, multiple receptors, interactions with other neurotransmitter systems, and consequent implications for understanding the actions of serotonergic drugs |volume=59 |issue=Suppl 15 |pages=4–12 |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry}}</ref> norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent dopamine, the significance of this phenomenon in the amelioration of psychiatric symptoms is not known.  Given the low overall response rates of antidepressants,<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=2012PLoSO...741778K |title=A Systematic Review of Comparative Efficacy of Treatments and Controls for Depression |author1=Khan |first1=Arif |last2=Faucett |first2=James |last3=Lichtenberg |first3=Pesach |last4=Kirsch |first4=Irving |last5=Brown |first5=Walter A. |volume=7 |year=2012 |journal=PLoS ONE |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0041778 |editor1-last=Holscher |editor1-first=Christian |issue=7 |pmid=22860015 |pages=e41778 |pmc=3408478}}</ref> and the poorly understood causes of depression, it is premature to assume a putative mechanism of action of antidepressants.

While MAOIs, TCAs and SSRIs increase serotonin levels, others prevent serotonin from binding to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, suggesting it is too simplistic to say serotonin is a happy hormone. In fact, when the former antidepressants build up in the bloodstream and the serotonin level is increased, it is common for the patient to feel worse for the first weeks of treatment. One explanation of this is that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors evolved as a saturation signal (people who use 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonists often gain weight), telling the animal to stop searching for food, a mate, etc., and to start looking for predators. In a threatening situation it is beneficial for the animal not to feel hungry even if it needs to eat. Stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors will achieve that. But if the threat is long lasting the animal needs to start eating and mating again - the fact that it survived shows that the threat was not so dangerous as the animal felt. So the number of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors decreases through a process known as [[downregulation]] and the animal goes back to its normal behavior. This suggests that there are two ways to relieve anxiety in humans with serotonergic drugs: by blocking stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors or by overstimulating them until they decrease via tolerance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The values above are expressed as [[Dissociation constant|equilibrium dissociation constant]]s. It should be noted that smaller dissociation constant indicates more efficacy. SERT, NET, and DAT correspond to the abilities of the compounds to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, respectively. The other values correspond to their affinity for various receptors. Note that desmethylclomipramine, a metabolite of clomipramine, has a comparably high affinity for the NET as clomipramine has for the SERT.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation===
Recent studies show pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes take place during [[clinical depression]], [[mania]] and [[bipolar disorder]], and it is possible that symptoms of these conditions are attenuated by the pharmacological effect of antidepressants on the immune system.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.11.015 |title=Cytokine profiles in bipolar affective disorder: Focus on acutely ill patients |year=2006 |last1=O'Brien |first1=Sinead M. |last2=Scully |first2=Paul |last3=Scott |first3=Lucinda V. |last4=Dinan |first4=Timothy G. |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=90 |issue=2–3 |pages=263–7 |pmid=16410025}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16358592 |year=2005 |last1=Obuchowicz |first1=Ewa |last2=Marcinowska |first2=Agnieszka |last3=Herman |first3=Zbigniew S. |title=Leki przeciwdepresyjne a cytokiny – badania kliniczne i doświadczalne |trans_title=Antidepressants and cytokines – clinical and experimental studies |language=Polish |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=921–36 |journal=Psychiatria Polska |url=http://www.psychiatriapolska.pl/uploads/PPt39n5s921Obuchowicz.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000089003 |title=''Interleukin-6'' Genetic Polymorphism and Chinese Major Depression |year=2005 |last1=Hong |first1=Chen-Jee |last2=Yu |first2=Younger W.-Y. |last3=Chen |first3=Tai-Jui |last4=Tsai |first4=Shih-Jen |journal=Neuropsychobiology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=202–5 |pmid=16244501}}</ref><ref name="Elen">{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000087104 |title=Cytokine Dysregulation, Inflammation and Well-Being |year=2005 |last1=Elenkov |first1=Ilia J. |last2=Iezzoni |first2=Domenic G. |last3=Daly |first3=Adrian |last4=Harris |first4=Alan G. |last5=Chrousos |first5=George P. |journal=Neuroimmunomodulation |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=255–69 |pmid=16166805}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2004.01.014 |title=Effects of serotonin and serotonergic agonists and antagonists on the production of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 |year=2005 |last1=Kubera |first1=Marta |last2=Maes |first2=Michael |last3=Kenis |first3=Gunter |last4=Kim |first4=Yong-Ku |last5=Lasoń |first5=Władysław |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=251–8 |pmid=15892984}}</ref>

Studies also show that the chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormones]] as a result of disease, including [[somatic]] [[infections]] or [[autoimmune]] syndromes, may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitters]] or other receptors in the brain by [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]] pro-inflammatory pathways, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones.<ref name="Elen"/> [[SSRI]]s, [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRIs]] and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressants]] acting on serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine receptors have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes, specifically on the regulation of [[Interferon-gamma]] (IFN-gamma) and [[Interleukin-10]] (IL-10), as well as [[TNF-alpha]] and [[Interleukin-6]] (IL-6).

==Therapeutic efficacy==
To establish [[efficacy]], an antidepressant must show that it can produce a therapeutic effect for the condition for which it is taken.  An antidepressant should be more efficacious than placebo to justify the risk associated with side effects. For depression, the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (HAM-D) is often used to measure the severity of depression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.23.1.56 |title=A Rating Scale for Depression |year=1960 |last1=Hamilton |first1=M. |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=23 |pages=56–62 |pmid=14399272 |pmc=495331 |issue=1}}</ref> The maximum score for the 17-item HAM-D questionnaire is 52; the higher the score, the more severe the depression. What constitute a sufficient response to a drug has not been well established, but total remission or virtual elimination of all depression symptoms is the goal, however, remission rates are rarely published. For placebo, the percentage of symptom reduction is approximately 31 to 38%, compared to 46 to 54% for antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0041778 |title=A Systematic Review of Comparative Efficacy of Treatments and Controls for Depression |year=2012 |editor1-last=Holscher |editor1-first=Christian |last1=Khan |first1=Arif |last2=Faucett |first2=James |last3=Lichtenberg |first3=Pesach |last4=Kirsch |first4=Irving |last5=Brown |first5=Walter A. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=e41778 |pmid=22860015 |pmc=3408478}}</ref>

On the basis of 234 studies, no clinically relevant superiority of one antidepressant over another was detected for the treatment of acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of depression, taking into account age, sex, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions. Individual drugs differed in onset of action, adverse events, and some measures of health-related quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Gerald |last1=Gartlehner |first2=Richard A. |last2=Hansen |first3=Laura C. |last3=Morgan |first4=Kylie |last4=Thaler |first5=Linda |last5=Lux |first6=Megan |last6=Van Noord |first7=Ursula |last7=Mager |first8=Patricia |last8=Thieda |first9=Bradley N. |last9=Gaynes |title=Comparative Benefits and Harms of Second-Generation Antidepressants for Treating Major Depressive Disorder: An Updated Meta-analysis |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=22147715 |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=155&page=772 |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-155-11-201112060-00009 |doi_brokendate=March 20, 2013 |year=2011 |volume=155 |issue=11 |pages=772–85}}</ref>

===Clinical guidelines===
The UK [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor; that for moderate or severe depression an SSRI is more likely to be tolerated than a tricyclic; and that antidepressants for severe depression should be combined with a psychological treatment such as [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |month=December |year=2004 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archivedate=15 November 2008 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

===="Trial and error" switching====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant. The remission rate reported by the STAR*D study was 21% using this method.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.<ref name="SSRIswitch"/>  However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant patients responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01458.x |title=No evidence for switching the antidepressant: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of a common therapeutic strategy |year=2010 |last1=Bschor |first1=T. |last2=Baethge |first2=C. |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=174–9 |pmid=19703121}}</ref>  Thus, the clinical response to the new drug might be a [[placebo effect]] associated with the belief that one is receiving a different medication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Augmentation and combination====
For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include: [[lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, [[dopamine agonists]], [[sex steroids]], [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRI's]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsants]]<ref name="augment">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x |title=Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression |year=2005 |last1=Debattista |first1=Charles |last2=Lembke |first2=Anna |journal=Current Psychiatry Reports |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=435–40 |pmid=16318821}}</ref>  The STAR*D project reported a remission rate of 30% with this method.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A combination strategy involves adding an additional antidepressant, usually from different class so as to have effect other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n0805 |title=Combining Antidepressants for Treatment-Resistant Depression |year=2002 |last1=Lam |first1=Raymond W. |last2=Wan |first2=Dante D.

Opponents of switching, augmentation and combination argue that treatment may also propel the illness to a malignant and treatment-unresponsive course with iatrogenic psychiatric-like symptoms and treatment resistance or episode acceleration.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000112883 |title=Atypical Antipsychotics: CATIE Study, Drug-Induced Movement Disorder and Resulting Iatrogenic Psychiatric-Like Symptoms, Supersensitivity Rebound Psychosis and Withdrawal Discontinuation Syndromes |year=2008 |last1=Chouinard |first1=Guy |last2=Chouinard |first2=Virginie-Anne |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=69–77 |pmid=18230939}}</ref>

====Long-term use====
The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of relapse. A recent meta-analysis of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 |title=Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: A systematic review |year=2003 |last1=Geddes |first1=John R |last2=Carney |first2=Stuart M |last3=Davies |first3=Christina |last4=Furukawa |first4=Toshiaki A |last5=Kupfer |first5=David J |last6=Frank |first6=Ellen |last7=Goodwin |first7=Guy M |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9358 |pages=653–61 |pmid=12606176}}</ref> The American Psychiatric Association guidelines advise four to five months of continuation treatment on an antidepressant following the resolution of symptoms.

====Antidepressant-induced Mania====
Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with bipolar depression or manic depression. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20-40% of bipolar patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x |title=Antidepressant-induced mania: An overview of current controversies |year=2003 |last1=Goldberg |first1=Joseph F |last2=Truman |first2=Christine J |journal=Bipolar Disorders |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=407–20 |pmid=14636364}}</ref>

:[[Eli Lilly and Company]] responded by highlighting that the study did not take into account more recent studies on its product, Prozac, and that it was proud of the difference Prozac has made to millions of people. [[GlaxoSmithKline]] warned that this one study should not be used to cause unnecessary alarm and concern for patients. Two leading UK psychiatrists/pharmacologists, with financial and professional links to pharmaceutical companies, argued that short-term approval trials are not very suitable for evaluating effectiveness, that the unpublished trials are of poorer quality, that the meta-analysis authors came from a "psychology background" rather than drug testing background, and that the media and "elements of the medico/scientific community" have "a down on antidepressants" and that the media does not appreciate the seriousness of depression and blames and stigmatizes sufferers in a manner rooted in medieval religious attitudes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0269881108091877 |title=Why does the world have such a 'down' on antidepressants? |year=2008 |last1=Nutt |first1=D. |last2=Malizia |first2=A. |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=223–6 |pmid=18541622}}</ref> [[Wyeth]] pointed out that the data were good enough for FDA approval of the drugs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Blue |first=L. |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1717306,00.html |title=Antidepressants Hardly Help |work=Time |date=February 26, 2008}}</ref>

==Controversy Regarding Placebo Effects and Efficacy in Mild Depression==
A review of antidepressant trials submitted to the U.S. FDA by the industry for drug approval revealed that when a trial was successful, the results of the trial was published 94% of the time, however, when the trial was not found to be more effective than placebo, it was only published 50% of the time. This demonstrated a measure of bias in reporting by industry.

Controversy regarding the efficacy of antidepressants has arisen due to studies showing that antidepressants fail to provide significantly greater efficacy than placebo in some studies. A 2002 study claimed that the difference between antidepressants and placebo is close to negligible.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |year=2002 |last1=Kirsch |first1=Irving |last2=Moore |first2=Thomas J. |last3=Scoboria |first3=Alan |last4=Nicholls |first4=Sarah S. |journal=Prevention & Treatment |volume=5}}</ref>

A study published in JAMA demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant.  The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.287.14.1840 |title=Placebo Response in Studies of Major Depression: Variable, Substantial, and Growing |year=2002 |last1=Walsh |first1=B.

An article in [[The Washington Post]] titled "Against Depression, a Sugar Pill Is Hard to Beat" stated, "A new analysis has found that in the majority of trials conducted by drug companies in recent decades, sugar pills have done as well as—or better than—antidepressants. Companies have had to conduct numerous trials to get two that show a positive result, which is the Food and Drug Administration's minimum for approval. What's more, the sugar pills, or placebos, cause profound changes in the same areas of the brain affected by the medicines, according to research published last week...  the makers of Prozac had to run five trials to obtain two that were positive, and the makers of Paxil and Zoloft had to run even more... When Leuchter compared the brain changes in patients on placebos, he was amazed to find that many of them had changes in the same parts of the brain that are thought to control important facets of mood... Once the trial was over and the patients who had been given placebos were told as much, they quickly deteriorated. People's belief in the power of antidepressants may explain why they do well on placebos..."<ref>[http://www.chelationtherapyonline.com/technical/p58.htm Against Depression, a Sugar Pill Is Hard to Beat], The Washington Post, May 7, 2002{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, two psychologists obtained 47 studies used by the FDA for approval of the six antidepressants prescribed most widely between 1987-99. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, "but not meaningful for people in clinical settings", says psychologist [[Irving Kirsch]], lead author of the study. He and co-author Thomas Moore released their findings in "Prevention and Treatment", an e-journal of the American Psychological Association.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-07-08-antidepressants.htm |title= Study: Antidepressant barely better than placebo |work=USA Today |date=2002-07-07 |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>
In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.<ref name="pmid18303940" />

Another study by psychologists at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Vanderbilt University]], the University of Colorado, and the [[University of New Mexico]] also found that antidepressant drugs hardly have better effects than a placebo in those cases of mild or moderate depression. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study focused on [[paroxetine]] (Paxil) from GlaxoSmithKline and imipramine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/05/antidepressant-paxil-placebo-business-healthcare-depression.html| title=Study Undermines Case for Antidepressants|date=2010-01-05|accessdate= 2010-07-01|work=Forbes|first=Robert|last=Langreth}}</ref>

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] recently performed a systematic review of clinical trials of the generic antidepressant amitriptyline. The study concluded that in spite of moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 |title=Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2012 |last1=Leucht |first1=Claudia |last2=Huhn |first2=Maximilian |last3=Leucht |first3=Stefan |editor1-last=Leucht |editor1-first=Claudia |pmid=23235671 |volume=12 |pages=CD009138}}</ref>

A review commissioned by the National Institute for Clinical excellence concluded that there there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with this review suggest that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}</ref>

In 2005, anti-depressants became the most prescribed drug in the United States, causing more debate over the issue. Some doctors believe this is a positive sign that people are finally seeking help for their issues. Others disagree, saying that this shows that people are becoming too dependent on anti-depressants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/09/antidepressants/index.html |title=CDC: Antidepressants most prescribed drugs in U.S  |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2011-05-21 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

In 2012, Aimee Hunter and her team used EEG and showed that taking placebo decreased pre-frontal brain activity in those subjects who had prior use of an antidepressants, similar to the expected antidepressant response, but increased brain activity in antidepressant naive subjects.

However, in the later experiment conducted by John H. Krystal at Yale University School of Medicine to assess whether growth mixture modeling can provide insights into antidepressant and placebo responses in clinical trials of patients with major depression showed that Duloxetine and SSRI did not differ in efficacy, and compared with placebo they significantly decreased the odds of following the nonresponder trajectory.

Difficulty tolerating [[adverse effects]] is the most common reason for antidepressant discontinuation.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Over 1500 side effects have been cataloged for the SSRI alone.

===General===
SSRI side effects include but are not limited to:
[[Serotonin syndrome]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], increased blood pressure, [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[headache]]s, [[anxiety]], nervousness, emotional lability, increased suicidal ideation, suicide attempts,  insomnia,  drug interactions, neonate adverse reactions, [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], dry mouth, somnolence, tremors, [[sexual dysfunction]] decreased [[libido]], asthenia, dyspepsia, [[dizziness]], sweating, personality disorder, epistaxis, urinary frequency, menorrhagia, mania/hypomania,<ref name=eli>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-199702000-00016 |title=Withdrawal Hypomania Associated with Paroxetine |year=1997 |last1=Landry |first1=Pierre |last2=Roy |first2=Line |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=17 |pages=60–1 |pmid=9004064 |issue=1}}</ref> chills, palpitations, taste perversion, and micturition disorder<ref>{{cite web |title=Highlights of prescribing information |url=http://pi.lilly.com/us/prozac.pdf |publisher=Eli lilly}}</ref> drowsiness, GI irregularities,muscle weakness, long term weight gain.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

SSRIs inhibit serotonin-mediated platelet activation. This leads to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding; at times as high as 57% increase in risk. This is especially important in the elderly, those with a history of peptic ulcer disease or previous gastrointestinal bleeding, and those on blood thinners, such as aspirin and clopidogrel. A recent observational study shows that SSRIs may increase the risk of transient ischemic attacks and strokes compared with tricyclic antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.d4551 |title=Antidepressant use and risk of adverse outcomes in older people: Population based cohort study |year=2011 |last1=Coupland |first1=C. |last2=Dhiman |first2=P. |last3=Morriss |first3=R. |last4=Arthur |first4=A. |last5=Barton |first5=G. |last6=Hippisley-Cox |first6=J. |journal=BMJ |volume=343 |pages=d4551 |pmid=21810886 |pmc=3149102}}</ref> 

Side-effects of an [[Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]] may include drowsiness, increased appetite, and weight gain.<ref name="Stimmel">{{cite journal |pmid=9017762 |year=1997 |last1=Stimmel |first1=GL |last2=Dopheide |first2=JA |last3=Stahl |first3=SM |title=Mirtazapine: An antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic effects |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=10–21 |journal=Pharmacotherapy}}</ref>

Tricyclic antidepressants common side effects include: [[dry mouth]], blurred vision, [[drowsiness]], [[dizziness]], tremors, sexual problems, [[skin rash]], and weight gain or loss.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Toxicity occurs at about ten times normal dosages; these drugs are often lethal in overdoses, as they may cause a fatal arrhythmia. However, tricyclic antidepressants are still used because of their effectiveness, especially in severe cases of major depression, their favorable price, and off label uses.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) side effects include:{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
MAOI can produce a potentially lethal hypertensive reaction if taken with foods that contain excessively high levels of [[tyramine]], such as mature cheese, cured meats or yeast extracts. Likewise, lethal reactions to both prescription and over the counter medications have occurred. Patients undergoing therapy with MAO inhibiting medications are monitored closely by their prescribing physicians, who are consulted before taking an over the counter or prescribed medication. Such patients must also inform emergency room personnel and keep information with their identification indicating that they are on MAOI. Some doctors suggest the use of [[medical identification tag]]s. Although these reactions may be lethal, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns is comparable to over-the-counter medications.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Other side effects of MAOI include: [[hepatitis]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], and [[seizures]]. Serotonin syndrome is a side-effect of MAOIs when combined with certain medications.  [[Moclobemide]] may be preferred in the elderly as its pharmacokinetics are not affected by age, is well tolerated by the elderly as well as younger adults, has few serious adverse events, and, in addition, it is as effective as other antidepressants that have more side-effects; moclobemide also has beneficial effects on cognition.<ref name="pmid7717092">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb05921.x |title=Reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase a in the treatment of depressed elderly patients |year=1995 |last1=Nair |first1=N.

===Pregnancy===
Pregnancy can trigger a range of emotions that make it more difficult to cope with depression. The risk of medication discontinuation and relapse have to be weighed against the risk to the developing fetus and baby. Some antidepressants have lower risk for the baby during pregnancy, but the FDA advises for the risk of birth defects with the use of Paxil<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=FDA Advising of Risk of Birth Defects with Paxil |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2005/ucm108527.htm |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> and the MAOI should be avoided.

Moreover, SSRIs inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, which leads to vasoconstriction. This is significant in pregnancy as SSRIs have been associated with the development of hypertension and pre-eclampsia of pregnancy. This in turn can lead to fetal prematurity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sivagnanam |first=G. |title=Antidepressants |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics |year=2012 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=287–8 |url=http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2012/3/3/287/99452}}</ref>

[[Bupropion]], a dual reuptake inhibitor (NE and DA), often causes a moderate increase in sexual drive, due to increased dopamine activity. This effect is also seen with dopamine reuptake inhibitors, CNS stimulants and dopamine agonists, and is due to increases in testosterone production (due to inhibition of prolactin) and nitric oxide synthesis.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Thymoanesthesia===
Closely related to sexual side-effects is the phenomenon of emotional blunting, or mood anesthesia. Many users of SSRIs complain of apathy, lack of motivation, emotional numbness, feelings of detachment, and indifference to surroundings. They may describe this as a feeling of "not caring about anything anymore." All SSRIs, SNRIs, and serotonergic TCAs can cause this to varying degrees, especially at high doses.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v58n0502 |title=A Comparison of Nefazodone and Fluoxetine on Mood and on Objective, Subjective, and Clinician-Rated Measures of Sleep in Depressed Patients |year=1997 |last1=Gillin |first1=J.

===REM Sleep===
All major antidepressant drugs, except trimipramine, mirtazapine and nefazodone suppress [[REM sleep]], and it has been proposed that the clinical efficacy of these drugs largely derives from their suppressant effects on REM sleep. The three major classes of antidepressant drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), profoundly suppress REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00004003 |title=The case against memory consolidation in REM sleep |year=2000 |last1=Vertes |first1=Robert P. |last2=Eastman |first2=Kathleen E. |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=867–76; discussion 904–1121 |pmid=11515146}}</ref> Mirtazapine either has no effect on REM sleep or increases it slightly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmaclub.com/news/content.nsf/MedicalNews/6B507D111151964A85256AA20069C3BA?OpenDocument&id= |title=Mirtazapine Regulates Stress Hormones, Improves Sleep In Depressed Patients: Presented at ISP}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref> The MAOIs almost completely suppress REM sleep, while the TCAs and SSRIs have been shown to produce immediate (40-85%) and sustained (30-50%) reductions in REM sleep. This effect often causes increased fatigue in patients who take large doses of antidepressants for extended periods of time. Such fatigue can occasionally interfere with a patient's everyday activities. Abrupt discontinuation of MAOIs can cause a temporary phenomenon known as "REM rebound" in which the patient experiences extremely vivid dreams and nightmares.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Weight gain===
Many antidepressants (TCA, TecA, [[paroxetine]] from the group of SSRI's) are associated with weight gain usually in the range of {{Convert|5|–|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} but rarely upwards of {{Convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The specific cause is unknown, but antidepressants are associated with increased cravings, an inability to feel full despite consuming enough calories, low energy levels and increased daytime sleepiness, which can lead to overeating and a lack of desire to exercise, and dry mouth, which can lead to ingestion of calorie-laden beverages.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The antihistaminic properties of certain TCA and TeCA class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side-effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication. Eating low fat, low protein carbohydrate snacks and carbohydrate-rich dinners allows the brain to make serotonin, which then controls appetite and balances mood. Carbohydrates thus eaten, as part of a balanced diet, by virtue of their effect on brain serotonin levels, can support weight loss in the setting of antidepressant weight gain.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12473965 |year=2002 |last1=Wurtman |first1=JJ |last2=McDermott |first2=JM |last3=Levendusky |first3=P |last4=Duca |first4=K |last5=Wurtman |first5=R |title=The effect of a novel dietary intervention on weight loss in psychotropic drug-induced obesity |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=55–9 |journal=Psychopharmacology bulletin}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wurtman |first1=JJ |last2=Marquis |first2=NF |title=The serotonin power diet: use your brain's natural chemistry to cut cravings, curb emotional overeating, and lose weight |year=2006 |publisher=Rodale |location=Emmaus, Penn |isbn=978-1-59486-346-2 |page=290}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===Withdrawal symptoms===
If a SSRI is suddenly discontinued, it frequently produces a [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]] that has a both a somatic and psychological [[withdrawal]] component.<ref name="TamamLut">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02850015 |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome: A review |year=2002 |last1=Tamam |first1=Lut |last2=Ozpoyraz |first2=Nurgul |journal=Advances in Therapy |volume=19 |pages=17–26 |pmid=12008858 |issue=1}}</ref>

Surveys indicate that antidepressant use, particularly of SSRIs, has increased rapidly in most developed countries, driven by an increased awareness of depression together with the availability and commercial promotion of new antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11149300 |year=2000 |last1=McManus |first1=Peter |last2=Mant |first2=Andrea |last3=Mitchell |first3=Philip B |last4=Montgomery |first4=William S |last5=Marley |first5=John |last6=Auland |first6=Merran E |title=Recent trends in the use of antidepressant drugs in Australia, 1990-1998 |volume=173 |issue=9 |pages=458–61 |journal=The Medical journal of Australia |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/173_09_061100/mcmanus/mcmanus.html}}</ref> Antidepressants are also increasingly used worldwide for non-depressive patients as studies continue to show the potential of immunomodulatory, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in antidepressants.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The choice of particular antidepressant is reported to be based, in the absence of research evidence of differences in efficacy, on seeking to avoid certain side-effects, and taking into account comorbid (co-occurring) psychiatric disorders, specific clinical symptoms and prior treatment history.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.7.1285 |title=Which Factors Influence Psychiatrists' Selection of Antidepressants? |year=2004 |last1=Zimmerman |first1=M. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=7 |pages=1285–9 |pmid=15229063 |last2=Posternak |first2=M |last3=Friedman |first3=M |last4=Attiullah |first4=N |last5=Baymiller |first5=S |last6=Boland |first6=R |last7=Berlowitz |first7=S |last8=Rahman |first8=S |last9=Uy |first9=K}}</ref>

The number of antidepressants prescribed by the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in the United Kingdom almost doubled during one decade, authorities reported in 2010. Furthermore the number highly increased in 2009 when 39.1 million [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]] were issued compared with 20.1 million issued in 1999. Also, physicians issued 3.18 million more prescriptions in 2009 than in 2008. Health authorities believed the increase was partly linked to the [[recession]]. However, other reasons include a diagnosis improvement, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] on mental ill-health, and more distress caused by the economic crisis. Furthermore, physicians concern is that some people who exhibit milder symptoms of depression are being prescribed drugs unnecessarily due to the lack of other options including talking therapies, [[counseling]] and [[cognitive behavior therapy]]. One more factor that may be increasing the consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[post traumatic stress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession| title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry|date=2010-06-11|accessdate= 2010-07-01 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rowenna | last=Davis| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100615165456/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession?| archivedate= 15 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

MAOIs can be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants, although they are generally used less frequently because they have a higher incidence of dangerous side effects and interactions.

* Ely Lilly In one of the only three cases to ever go to trial for SSRI indication in suicide, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] was caught corrupting the judicial process by making a deal with the plaintiff's attorney to throw the case, in part by not disclosing damaging evidence to the jury. The case, known as the [[Fentress Case]] involved a Kentucky man, [[Joseph Wesbecker]], on Prozac, who went to his workplace and opened fire with an assault rifle killing 8 people (including Fentress), and injuring 12 others before turning the gun on himself. The jury returned a 9-to-3 verdict in favor of Lilly. The judge, in the end, took the matter to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which found that "there was a serious lack of candor with the trial court and there may have been deception, bad faith conduct, abuse of judicial process and, perhaps even fraud." The judge later revoked the verdict and instead, recorded the case as settled. The value of the secret settlement deal has never been disclosed, but was reportedly "tremendous".<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Zitrin |first2=Carol M. |last2=Langford |chapter=Hide and Secrets in Louisville |title=The Moral Compass of the American Lawyer |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1999}}{{page needed|date=March 2013}}</ref>
