'''Discitis''' or '''diskitis''' is an [[infection]] in the [[intervertebral disc space]] that affects different age groups, but usually spontaneously affects children under 8 years of age. Nonetheless, discitis occurs post surgically in approximately 1-2 percent of patients after spinal surgery.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include severe back pain, leading to lack of mobility. Some very young children may refuse to walk and arching of the back is possible. In post-operative situations, the symptoms occur within a week and result in severe low back pain or neck pain (depending on the surgical location). If untreated, the discitis may resolve on its own, cause a chronic low grade infection, or progress to [[osteomyelitis]] and possibly even an [[epidural abscess]]. In case of concomitant inflammation of one or more vertebrae (in such cases usually the areas adjacent to the intervertebral disc spaces)<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VRnFkfvRT4EC&pg=PA147 Page 147] in:{{cite book |author=Hinchcliffe, Ronald; Fritz Hefti; Jundt, Gernot; Freuler, F. |title=Pediatric Orthopedics in Practice |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007|pages= |isbn=3-540-69963-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> the condition is called [[spondylodiscitis]].

==Causes==
There is debate as to the cause, although hematogenous seeding of the offending organism is favored as well as direct spread. It is important to differentiate between spontaneous discitis which is usually from [[hematologic]] spread from a urinary or respiratory infection versus that from a [[Post-operative infection|post-operative complication]] which usually involves [[skin flora]] such as [[Staphylococcus aureus|staph aureus]]. 

The cause may be [[aseptic]].<ref>{{cite pmid|15850997}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is usually apparent on [[MRI]] although plain X-rays and [[CT scan|CT examinations]] can be suggestive. The MRI will reveal air changes in the disc and possibly even external involvement involving the bone or [[Epidural space|epidural regions]]. A [[biopsy]] may be performed and helps with diagnosis in some cases but often an organism is not obtained. [[C-reactive protein]] levels and [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR levels]] will be elevated and are useful for treatment. Often, the [[white blood cell count]] will be normal and the patient will be [[afebrile]].

==Treatment==
Treatment usually includes [[antibiotics]], and reducing the mobility of the affected region, either with a [[back brace]] or a [[plaster cast]]. Without treatment, the patient may form an [[abscess]] which may need to be surgically corrected. Due to the poor [[vascularity]] of the disc, drugs required for treatment often include potent agents such as [[Ciprofloxacin]] along with [[Vancomycin]]. Occasionally, oral drugs can be used to treat the infection but it may fail and IV drugs may be required.

If the patient is an adult many surgeons and doctors now  recommend moving little and often and within the pain limits of the medication.  Discs respond to [[osmotic pressure]] therefore movement is beneficial to increase their blood flow and fluid dynamics. This is why disc patients are no longer told to bed rest. In children whether to bed rest or move a little is decided on an individual basis, depending on the site and severity of the discitis.
