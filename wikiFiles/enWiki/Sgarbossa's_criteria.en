'''Sgarbossa's criteria''' is a set of [[electrocardiogram|electrocardiographic]] findings generally used to identify [[myocardial infarction|acute myocardial infarction]] in the presence of a [[left bundle branch block|left bundle branch block (LBBB)]] or a paced rhythm.

== Background ==
[[Acute myocardial infarction]] (MI) is often difficult to detect when LBBB is present on ECG. A large clinical trial of thrombolytic therapy for acute MI (GUSTO-1) evaluated the electrocardiographic diagnosis of evolving acute MI in the presence of LBBB.<ref name="Sgarbossa">{{cite journal|last1=Sgarbossa|first1=Elena B.|last2=Pinski|first2=Sergio L.|last3=Barbagelata|first3=Alejandro|last4=Underwood|first4=Donald A.|last5=Gates|first5=Kathy B.|last6=Topol|first6=Eric J.|last7=Califf|first7=Robert M.|last8=Wagner|first8=Galen S.|title=Electrocardiographic Diagnosis of Evolving Acute Myocardial Infarction in the Presence of Left Bundle-Branch Block|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=334|issue=8|year=1996|pages=481–487|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM199602223340801}}</ref> Among 26,003 North American patients who had an acute myocardial infarction confirmed by enzyme studies, 131 (0.5%) had LBBB. A scoring system, now commonly called Sgarbossa criteria, was developed from the coefficients assigned by a logistic model for each independent criterion, on a scale of 0 to 5. A minimal score of 3 was required for a specificity of 90%.

== Sgarbossa's criteria ==

Three criteria are included in Sgarbossa's criteria:<ref name="Sgarbossa" />
* ST elevation ≥1&nbsp;mm in a lead with upward (concordant) QRS complex - 5 points
* ST depression ≥1&nbsp;mm in lead V1, V2, or V3 - 3 points
* ST elevation ≥5&nbsp;mm in a lead with downward (discordant) QRS complex - 2 points

≥3 points = 90% specificity of STEMI (sensitivity of 36%)<ref name="Sgarbossa" />

== Validation and usefulness ==
A high take-off of the ST segment in leads V1 to V3 is well-described with uncomplicated LBBB, such as in the setting of [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]. In a substudy from the ASSENT 2 and 3 trials, the third criteria added little diagnostic or prognostic value.<ref name="Al-FalehFu2006">{{cite journal|last1=Al-Faleh|first1=Hussam|last2=Fu|first2=Yuling|last3=Wagner|first3=Galen|last4=Goodman|first4=Shaun|last5=Sgarbossa|first5=Elena|last6=Granger|first6=Christopher|last7=Van de Werf|first7=Frans|last8=Wallentin|first8=Lars|last9=W.

A Sgarbossa score of ≥3 was [[specific]] but not [[sensitive]] (36%) in the validation sample in the original report.<ref name="Sgarbossa" /> A subsequent meta-analysis of 10 studies consisting of 1614 patients showed that a Sgarbossa score of ≥3 had a specificity of 98% and sensitivity of 20%.<ref name="TabasRodriguez2008">{{cite journal|last1=Tabas|first1=Jeffrey A.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Robert M.|last3=Seligman|first3=Hilary K.|last4=Goldschlager|first4=Nora F.|title=Electrocardiographic Criteria for Detecting Acute Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Left Bundle Branch Block: A Meta-analysis|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=52|issue=4|year=2008|pages=329–336.e1|issn=01960644|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.12.006}}</ref> The sensitivity may increase if serial or previous ECGs are available.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = E.

== Other methods for detecting AMI in patient's with LBBB ==
Several other studies have evaluated the usefulness of different ECG findings in diagnosing acute MI when LBBB is present. Wackers et al. correlated ECG changes in LBBB with localization of the infarct by thallium scintigraphy.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = F. J. Wackers| title = The diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block| journal = Cardiology clinics| volume = 5| issue = 3| pages = 393–401| year = 1987| month = August| pmid = 3690603}}</ref> The most useful ECG criteria were:
* Serial ECG changes — 67 percent sensitivity
* ST segment elevation — 54 percent sensitivity
* Abnormal Q waves  — 31 percent sensitivity
* Cabrera's sign — 27 percent sensitivity, 47 percent for anteroseptal MI
* Initial positivity in V1 with a Q wave in V6 — 20 percent sensitivity but 100 percent specificity for anteroseptal MI
