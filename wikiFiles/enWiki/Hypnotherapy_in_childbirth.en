{{Hypnosis}}
'''Hypnotherapy in childbirth''' refers to the use of [[hypnotherapy]] to assist in [[childbirth|the birthing process]]. This practice, known as hypnobirthing, functions on the premise that most labour-related pain is as a result of fear and tension,<ref name="Lawrence">{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1357023/As-NHS-launches-study-hypnobirthing-ask-Can-really-pain-having-baby.html |title=Can 'hypnobirthing' really take the pain out of having a baby? |last=Lawrence |first=Julia |date=16 February 2011 |publisher=[[The Daily Mail]] |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> which can be diminished<ref name="Mendoza"/> or completely eliminated<ref name="Squire">{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1264720/Does-self-hypnosis-giving-birth-prevent-pain.html#ixzz2RiXOQ1Xu |title=Hypnosis and the natural birth debate: More and more women are opting to give birth under self hypnosis, but does it work? |last=Squire |first=Alison Smith |date=9 April 2010 |publisher=[[The Daily Mail]] |accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref> with hypnotherapy.

==Theory==

Hypnotherapy during childbirth is based on the theory that to experience an easy and comfortable birth, women need to have an understanding of the way in which the uterus functions naturally during normal childbirth when unencumbered by fear, along with the illeffects of the fear-tension-pain cycle on the birthing process. Birthing women and their support partners are taught non-pharmcological strategies, such as [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[meditation]] and [[Creative visualization|visualisation]], that allow the body to birth normally without restrictions to assist in pain free, easier, more comfortable birthing.<ref name="mongan">{{cite book|last=Mongan|first=Marie F.|title=HypnoBirthing: The Mongan Method: A Natural Approach To A Safe, Easier, More Comfortable Birthing (3rd Edition)|year=2005|publisher=HCI}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|coauthors=Sanjay Datta, Bhavani Shankar Kodali, Scott Segal|title=Non-pharmacological Methods for Relief of Labor Pain|journal=Obstetric Anesthesia Handbook|year=2010|pages=85–93|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-88602-2_7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips-Moore|first=J.|title=HypnoBirthing|journal=TheAustralian Journal of Holistic Nursing|year=2005|volume=12|issue=1|pages=41–2|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=492196603589508;res=IELHEA|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wainer|first=N|title=HypnoBirthing.

==History==
In 1942, ''Childbirth without Fear'' was published; it was a book written by English [[obstetrician]] [[Grantly Dick-Read]] and French obstetrician [[Michel Odent]], that introduced the idea of using hypnotherapy for childbirth.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Odent |first1=Michel |authorlink1=Michel Odent |last2=Dick-Read |first2=Grantly |authorlink2=Grantly Dick-Read |title=Childbirth without fear: the principles and practice of natural childbirth |publisher=Pinter & Martin |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-9530964-6-7}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The work was further developed by Jacqueline Vincent Priya,<ref>{{Cite book

In the United Kingdom, the work has been further developed by Heidi Woodgate,<ref>[http://www.blissfulbirth.co.uk/] Blissful Birth</ref> Sophie Fletcher<ref>[http://www.mindfulmamma.co.uk/] Mindful Mamma</ref> and Maggie Howell.<ref>[http://www.natalhypnotherapy.co.uk/] Natal Hypnotherapy</ref>

Obstetrician [[Grantly Dick-Read]] first wrote about the use of hypnosis to reduce pain in the 1930s in his work on [[natural childbirth]] and since the 1980s a range of different techniques have been developed that utilize hypnosis in a natural childbirth.

==Research==
[[Hypnosis]] is generally considered a controversial treatment. There have been studies refuting claims that hypnosis is effective in reducing or eliminating pain during childbirth. A 2004 research review found insufficient evidence to show that the technique is effective,<ref name = Cyna>{{cite pmid | 15277295 }}</ref> and two 2012 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane reviews]] found that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnosis is effective in managing or treating pain in childbirth or [[postnatal depression]].<ref name = Cochranedepression>{{cite pmid | 22696381 }}</ref><ref name = Cochranepain>{{cite pmid | 22419342 }}</ref>

However, there have been studies confirming the claims that, compared to general population figures, hypnosis and self-hypnosis during childbirth leads to:<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Eappen, Sunil; Robbins, Deborah|title=Nonpharmacological Means of Pain Relief for Labor and Delivery|journal=International Anesthesiology Clinics|year=2002|volume=40|issue=4|pages=103–114|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="phillips">{{cite journal|last=Phillips-Moore|first=Julie|title=Birthing outcomes from an Australian HypnoBirthing programme|journal=British Journal of Midwifery|year=2012|volume=20|issue=8|pages=558–564|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> 
*decreased average length of labour
*lower cesarean section rates
*decreased use of pain relief medication such as gas and epidurals
*increased ease and comfort of labour and birth (self-reported and observed)
*emotional satisfaction of having their birthing partners informed, involved and supportive.

In addition to this, the majority of women experiencing hypnosis during childbirth in their second or subsequent births report feeling more in control, confident, relaxed and focused, and less fearful, than during their other birthing experiences.<ref name="phillips" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Shirley|title=HypnoBirthing.
