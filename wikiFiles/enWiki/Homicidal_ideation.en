'''Homicidal ideation''' is a common [[medical terminology|medical term]] for thoughts about [[homicide]]. There is a range of homicidal thoughts which spans from vague ideas of revenge to detailed and fully formulated plans without the act itself.<ref name = "PsychServ">{{cite journal

It may arise in association with [[personality disorder]]s or it may occur in people who do not have any detectable illness.

==Assessment / Diagnostic Issues==
===Violence risk===
Homicidal ideation is noted to be an important risk factor when trying to identify a person's risk for [[violence]]. This type of assessment is routine for psychiatric patients<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.emedicine.com/Med/topic3358.htm|title= History and Mental Status Examination|accessdate= 2008-04-29|author= Brannon, Guy E.|last= Brannon|first= Guy|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2008|month= February|work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> or any other patients presenting to hospital with mental health complaints. There are many associated risk factors which include: history of violence and any thoughts of committing harm, poor impulse control and an inability to [[Deferred gratification|delay gratification]], impairment or loss of reality testing, especially with [[delusion]]al beliefs or command [[hallucination]]s, the feeling of being controlled by an outside force, the belief that other people wish to harm him or her, the perception of [[Social rejection|rejection]] or [[humiliation]] at the hands of others,<ref name="PsychServ" /> being under the [[Substance intoxication|influence]] of substances or a past history of [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[frontal lobe]] dysfunction or [[head injury]]. If a person has access to [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]], [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], or [[weapon]]s at home, their risk of homicidal ideation or violence is increased.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=5632|title= Management of persons with psychoses.|accessdate= 2008-04-29|author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2004|month= May|work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Associated psychopathology===
People who have homicidal ideation are at higher risk of other [[mental disorder|psychopathology]] than the normal population. This includes [[suicidal ideation]], [[psychosis]], [[delirium]], or intoxication.<ref>{{cite journal

Homicidal Ideation may arise in relation to behavioural conditions such as [[Personality Disorder]] (particularly [[Conduct disorder]] and [[Antisocial personality disorder]]). A study in Finland shows an increased risk of violence from people who have antisocial personality disorder which is greater than the risk of violence from people who have schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal

Homicidal ideation may arise in people who are otherwise quite well,<ref name="PsychServ" /> as is demonstrated by the fact that the greater majority of people within the general population have had homicidal fantasies. When triggering factors are sought regarding homicidal fantasies the majority seem to be linked in some way to the disruption of a couple relationship. Either [[jealousy]] or [[revenge]], greed/[[lust]] or even [[fear]] and [[self defence]] prompt homicidal thoughts and actions in the majority of cases.<ref name="DBuss">{{cite book

People who present with homicidal ideation also have a higher risk of suicide. This shows the need for an assessment of suicide risk in people with thoughts of violence towards others.<ref name="PsychServ" />

===Spurious and Factitious Homicidal Ideation===
Sometimes people claiming to have homicidal ideation do not actually have homicidal thoughts but merely claim to have them. They may do this for a variety of reasons, e.g. to gain attention, to coerce a person or people for or against some action, or to avoid social or legal obligation (sometimes by gaining admission to a hospital) - [[malingering]] or [[Factitious disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Theories==

A number of [[Theory|theories]] have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of homicidal ideation or [[homicide]] itself.<ref name="InnateMind" /> Many of these theories seem to overlap. They often are not mutually exclusive. At present no single theory explains all the phenomena noted in homicide, although many theories go some way to explaining several areas. Most of these theories follow the reasoning of theories studied in [[criminology]]. A brief synopsis of theories specific to homicide follows.

===Homicide adaptation===
This is the most recent of evolutionary theories. It claims to explain most of the phenomena associated with homicide. It states that humans have evolved with adaptations that enable us to think of and/or plan homicide. We come up with the idea as a possible answer to our problem position (threat to ourselves, our mate or our resources) and include a range of thought processes regarding killer and victim (degree of relatedness, relative status, gender, reproductive values, size and strength of families, allies and resources) and the potential costs of making use of such a high penalty strategy as homicide. If homicide is determined to be the best solution strategy, then it might be functional.<ref name="JDuntley" /><ref name="DBuss" />

===By-product hypothesis ("slip up")===
According to this hypothesis, homicide is considered to be a mistake or over-reaction. Normal psychological mechanisms for control of property, partner or personal safety may not appear to be sufficient under certain stressful circumstances and abnormal mechanisms develop. Particularly extreme expressions of this may occur leading to homicide where in the normal state the perpetrator would not behave in this manner.<ref name="InnateMind" />

==Management==
Not much information is available regarding the management of patients with homicidal thoughts. In Western countries, the management of such people lies within the realms of the police force and the health system. It is generally agreed upon that people with homicidal thoughts who are thought to be at high risk of acting them out should be recognized as needing help. They should be brought swiftly to a place where an assessment can be made and any underlying medical or psychiatric illness should be treated.<ref>{{cite journal
