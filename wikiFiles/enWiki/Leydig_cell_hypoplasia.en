'''Leydig cell hypoplasia''' (or '''aplasia''') ('''LCH'''), also known as '''Leydig cell agenesis''', is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorder|genetic]] and [[endocrine disease|endocrine]] [[syndrome]] affecting an estimated 1 in 1,000,000 biological [[male]]s. It is characterized by an inability of the body to respond to [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), a [[gonadotropin]] which is normally responsible for signaling [[Leydig cell]]s of the [[testicle]]s to produce [[testosterone]] and other [[androgen]] [[sex hormone]]s. The condition manifests itself as [[pseudohermaphroditism]] (partially or fully underdeveloped [[genitalia]]), [[hypergonadotropic hypogonadism]] (decreased or lack of production of [[sex steroid]]s by the [[gonad]]s despite high circulating levels of gonadotropins), reduced or absent [[puberty]] (lack of development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, resulting in [[sexual infantilism]] if left untreated), and [[infertility]].<ref name="pmid10704433">{{cite journal | author = Wu SM, Leschek EW, Rennert OM, Chan WY | title = Luteinizing hormone receptor mutations in disorders of sexual development and cancer | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience : a Journal and Virtual Library | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = D343–52 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10704433 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009">{{cite book | author1 = Eberhard Nieschlag | author2 = Hermann M.

Leydig cell hypoplasia does not occur in biological females as they do not have either Leydig cells or testicles. However, the cause of the condition in males, '''luteinizing hormone insensitivity''', does affect females, and because LH plays a role in the female [[reproductive system]], it can result in [[primary amenorrhea]] or [[oligomenorrhea]] (absent or reduced [[menstruation]]), infertility due to [[anovulation]], and [[ovarian cyst]]s.<ref name="pmid10704433">{{cite journal | author = Wu SM, Leschek EW, Rennert OM, Chan WY | title = Luteinizing hormone receptor mutations in disorders of sexual development and cancer | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience : a Journal and Virtual Library | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = D343–52 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10704433 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid10202864">{{cite journal | author = Arnhold IJ, Latronico AC, Batista MC, Mendonca BB | title = Menstrual disorders and infertility caused by inactivating mutations of the luteinizing hormone receptor gene | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 597–601 | year = 1999 | month = April | pmid = 10202864 | doi = | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015-0282(98)00517-2}}</ref>

A related condition is [[follicle-stimulating hormone insensitivity|follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) insensitivity]], which presents with similar symptoms to those of Leydig cell hypoplasia but with the symptoms in the respective sexes reversed (i.e., hypogonadism and sexual infantilism in females and merely problems with fertility in males). Despite their similar causes, FSH insensitivity is considerably less common in comparison to LH insensitivity.<ref name="Sperling2008">{{cite book | author = Mark A.

==Cause==
[[File:46,XY individual with complete LH insensitivity.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A 46,XY (biologically male) woman with complete insensitivity to LH, resulting in fully feminized genitalia at birth. Puberty appears to have commenced, likely due to estrogen replacement therapy.]]

Leydig cell hypoplasia is caused by [[genetic mutation]]s in ''LHCGR'', a [[gene]] which encodes the [[luteinizing hormone receptor|LH/hCG receptor]]. LH normally acts through the LH/hCG receptor to stimulate the growth of Leydig cells in the testicles and the production of androgens such as testosterone and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by these cells. In Leydig cell hypoplasia however, there is a reduced capacity for the LH/hCG receptor to respond to LH. This results in hypoplasia or absence of Leydig cells, [[testicular atrophy]], and lower than normal androgen levels. In the most severe form of the condition in which there is a complete lack of response of the Leydig cells to LH, androgen production by the testicles is virtually negligible and secondary sexual characteristics entirely fail to develop at [[puberty]].<ref name="pmid10704433">{{cite journal | author = Wu SM, Leschek EW, Rennert OM, Chan WY | title = Luteinizing hormone receptor mutations in disorders of sexual development and cancer | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience : a Journal and Virtual Library | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = D343–52 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10704433 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009" /><ref name="pmid12428200">{{cite journal | author = Themmen AP, Verhoef-Post M | title = LH receptor defects | journal = Seminars in Reproductive Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 199–204 | year = 2002 | month = August | pmid = 12428200 | doi = 10.1055/s-2002-35384 | url = http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2002-35384}}</ref><ref name="pmid20541150">{{cite journal | author = Mendonca BB, Costa EM, Belgorosky A, Rivarola MA, Domenice S | title = 46,XY DSD due to impaired androgen production | journal = Best Practice & Research.

==Symptoms==
The [[symptom]]s of Leydig cell hypoplasia include pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., [[feminization (biology)|feminized]], [[ambiguous genitalia|ambiguous]], or relatively mildly underdeveloped (e.g., [[micropenis]], severe [[hypospadias]],<ref name="Lifshitz2007">{{cite book | author = Fima Lifshitz | title = Pediatric Endocrinology | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=l7U55V9lT_IC&pg=PA374 | accessdate = 5 June 2012 | date = February 2007 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 978-1-4200-5523-8 | page = 374}}</ref> and/or [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testes)) [[external genitalia]]), a female [[gender identity]] or [[gender variance]], [[hypergonadotropic hypogonadism]] ([[hypogonadism]] despite high levels of gonadotropins), delayed, impaired, or fully absent [[puberty]] with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics ([[sexual infantilism]]), impaired [[fertility]] or complete [[sterility]], [[tall stature]] (due to delayed [[epiphyseal closure]]), [[eunuch|eunuchoid]] [[human skeleton|skeletal]] proportions, delayed or absent [[bone maturation]], and [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="pmid10704433">{{cite journal | author = Wu SM, Leschek EW, Rennert OM, Chan WY | title = Luteinizing hormone receptor mutations in disorders of sexual development and cancer | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience : a Journal and Virtual Library | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = D343–52 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10704433 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009" />

==Treatment==
Patients with Leydig cell hypoplasia may be treated with [[hormone replacement therapy]] (i.e., with androgens), which will result in normal [[sexual development]] and the resolution of most symptoms. In the case of 46,XY (biologically male) individuals who are phenotypically female and/or identify as the female gender, estrogens should be given instead. Surgical correction of the genitals in 46,XY males may be required, and, if necessary, an [[orchidopexy]] (relocation of the undescended testes to the scrotum) may be performed as well.<ref name="NieschlagBehre2009" />
