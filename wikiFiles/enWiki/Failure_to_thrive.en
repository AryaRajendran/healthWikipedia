When not more precisely defined, the term refers to [[pediatric]] patients. In [[MeSH]], the term is assumed to refer to an infant or child.<ref>{{MeshName|Failure+to+Thrive}}</ref> In children, it is usually defined in terms of [[weight]], and can be evaluated either by a low weight for the child's age, or by a low rate of increase in the weight.<ref name="urlFailure to Thrive: Miscellaneous Disorders in Infants and Children: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://155.91.16.2/mmpe/sec19/ch286/ch286b.html |title=Failure to Thrive: Miscellaneous Disorders in Infants and Children: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref>

As used by [[pediatrician]]s, it covers poor physical growth of any cause and does not imply abnormal intellectual, social, or emotional development, although of course it can subsequently be a cause of such pathologies.

Traditionally, causes of FTT have been divided into endogenous and exogenous causes. Initial investigation should consider physical causes, calorie intake and psychosocial assessment.

* [[endogenous]] (or "organic"): Causes are due to physical or mental issues with the child himself. It can include various [[inborn error of metabolism]]. Problems with the [[gastrointestinal system]] such as [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|gas and acid reflux]] are painful conditions which may make the child unwilling to take in sufficient nutrition. [[Cystic fibrosis]], [[diarrhea]], [[liver disease]], and [[celiac disease]] make it more difficult for the body to absorb nutrition. Other causes include physical deformities such as [[cleft palate]] and [[Ankyloglossia|tongue tie]]. [[Milk allergies]] can cause endogenous FTT. Also the [[metabolism]] may be raised by [[parasites]], [[asthma]], [[urinary tract infections]], and other fever-inducing infections, or [[heart disease]] so that it becomes difficult to get in sufficient calories to meet the higher caloric demands.

* [[exogenous]] (or "nonorganic"): Caused by caregiver's actions. Examples include physical inability to produce enough breastmilk, using only babies' cues to regulate breastfeeding so as to not offer a sufficient numbers of feeds (sleepy baby syndrome),<ref name="PMC1483563">{{cite journal |author=B.&nbsp;F. Habbick and J.&nbsp;W. Gerrard |title=Failure to thrive in the contented breast-fed baby |journal=Can Med Assoc J. |volume=131 |issue=7 |pages=765–768 |year=1984 |doi= |pmc=1483563 |pmid=6541091}}</ref> inability to procure formula when needed, purposely limiting total caloric intake (often for what the caregiver views as a more aesthetically pleasing child), and not offering sufficient age-appropriate solid foods for babies and toddlers over the age of six months.

* Mixed: However, to think of the terms as [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] can be misleading, since both endogenous and exogenous factors may co-exist. For instance a child who is not getting sufficient nutrition may act content so that caregivers do not offer feedings of sufficient frequency or volume, and a child with severe acid reflux who appears to be in pain while eating may make a caregiver hesitant to offer sufficient feedings.

Recently the term "faltering growth" has become a popular replacement for "failure to thrive", which in the minds of some represents a more [[euphemism|euphemistic]] term.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Adults==
The term "failure to thrive" is also applied to geriatrics, or more generally in adult medicine.<ref name="pmid8633822">{{cite journal |author=Sarkisian C.&nbsp;A., Lachs M.

In adult medicine, ''failure to thrive'' is a descriptive, non-specific term that encompasses "not doing well":  e.g.,&nbsp;[[malaise]], weight loss, poor self-care that can be seen in elderly individuals.
