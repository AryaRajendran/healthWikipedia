'''22q13 Deletion Syndrome''' (spoken as ''twenty two q one three''), also known as '''Phelan-McDermid Syndrome''', is a genetic disorder caused by deletions or rearrangements on [[chromosome 22]]. The deletion occurs at the terminal end of the [[chromosome]] at the location designated q13.3.  Some terminal deletions can be uncovered by [[karyotype]] analysis, but many deletions are too small (microdeletions). The availability of [[DNA microarray]]technology, and microarray's utility in looking for multiple genetic problems simultaneously, have made this technology the diagnostic tool of choice.  However, [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) tests are valuable for diagnosing cases of mosaicism ([[mosaic]] genetics) and chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., [[ring chromosome]], unbalanced [[chromosomal translocation]]). There is a great deal of interest in one gene that is often deleted in '''Phelan-McDermid Syndrome''', [[SHANK3]] (also known as PROSAP2). Errors in this gene have been associated with [[Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD) and [[Schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Gauthier ''et al.''|title=De novo mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 in patients ascertained for schizophrenia.| journal= Proc.

'''Phelan-McDermid Syndrome''' is characterized by global developmental delay, absent or severely delayed speech, and neonatal [[hypotonia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phelan MC, McDermid HE |title=The 22q13.3 Deletion Syndrome (Phelan-McDermid Syndrome). |journal=Mol Syndromol. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=186–201 |year=2011 |pmid= 22670140|doi= 10.1159/000334260}}</ref>  There are approximately 600 reported cases of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome worldwide.

==Characteristics==
The core characteristics of '''22q13 Deletion Syndrome''' (listed above) have a major impact on the individual.  However, in addition to these characteristics, there are other manifestations than may range from mild to severe: 

'''Physical'''
* Absent to severely delayed speech: 99%
* [[Hypotonia]] (poor muscle tone): 97%
* Normal to accelerated growth: 95%
* Increased tolerance to pain: 86%
* Thin, flaky toenails: 78%
* Large, fleshy hands: 68%
* Prominent, poorly formed ears: 65%
* Pointed chin: 62%
* [[Dolichocephaly]] (elongated head): 57%
* [[Ptosis (eyelid)]] (droopy eyelids): 57%
* Poor [[thermoregulation]]: 51%

'''Behavioral'''
* Chewing on non food items (clothing, bedding, toys):70%
* Teeth grinding: (percent undetermined)
* Autistic behaviors:  (percent undetermined)
* Tongue thrusting: (percent undetermined)
* Hair pulling: (percent undetermined)
* Aversion to clothes: (percent undetermined)

==Etiology==
The deletion affects the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (the [[paternal]] chromosome in 75% of cases), from 22q13.3 to 22qter. Although the deletion is most typically a result of a de novo mutation, there is an inherited form resulting from familial chromosomal translocations involving the 22 chromosome. In the de novo form, the size of the deletion is variable and can go from 130kbp (130,000 [[base pairs]]) to 9Mbp (9,000,000 base pairs). At one time it was thought that deletion size was not related to the core clinical features.<ref name="Wilson HL, Wong AC, Shaw SR, et al. 2003 575–84">{{cite journal |author=Wilson HL, Wong AC, Shaw SR, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular characterisation of the 22q13 deletion syndrome supports the role of haploinsufficiency of SHANK3/PROSAP2 in the major neurological symptoms |journal=J.

==Incidence==
The incidence of the 22q13 deletion syndrome is uncertain. Current thinking is that 22q13 deletion syndrome remains largely under-diagnosed, and may be one of the principal causes of idiopathic mental retardation.
