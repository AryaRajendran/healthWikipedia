'''Haemophilia C''' is a mild form of [[haemophilia]] affecting both sexes. However, it predominantly occurs in Jews of [[Ashkenazi]] descent. It is the fourth most common [[coagulation]] disorder after [[von Willebrand's disease]] and [[haemophilia]] [[Haemophilia A|A]] and [[Haemophilia B|B]].<ref>http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-885719013.htm</ref> In the [[USA]] it is thought to affect 1 in 100,000 of the adult population, making it 10% as common as haemophilia A.<ref name="eMed">[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic964.htm eMedicine - Hemophilia C : Article by Prasad Mathew, MBBS, DCH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

It is caused by a deficiency of [[coagulation]] [[factor XI]] and is distinguished from haemophilia A and B by the fact it does not lead to bleeding into the joints. Furthermore, it has [[autosomal]] inheritance, since the gene for factor XI is located on chromosome 4 (close to the prekallikrein gene); and it is not completely [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]], individuals who are [[heterozygous]] also show increased bleeding.<ref name="eMed" /> Many mutations exist, and the bleeding risk is not always influenced by the severity of the deficiency. Treatment is usually not necessary, except in relation to [[Surgery|operation]]s, leading to many of those having the condition not being aware of it. In these cases, [[fresh frozen plasma]] or recombinant factor XI may be used, but only if necessary. The afflicted may often suffer nosebleeds, and females can experience heavy [[menstrual bleeding]].<ref>[http://www.hemophilia.org.uk/index.php?content_id=91&parent=278 Key facts: other bleeding disorders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Haemophilia C was first discovered in a young Ashkenazic Jewish American in the 1950s.
