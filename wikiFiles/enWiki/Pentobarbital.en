'''Pentobarbital''' (US English) or '''pentobarbitone''' (UK English) is a short-acting [[barbiturate]] that was first synthesized in 1928. Pentobarbital can occur as as both a free acid and [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as [[sodium]] and calcium. The free acid is only slightly soluble in water and [[ethanol]].<ref name=pubchem>

One brand name for this drug is '''Nembutal''', coined by Dr. John S. Lundy, who started using it in 1930, from the structural formula of the sodium salt&mdash;'''N'''a (sodium) + [[ethyl group|'''e'''thyl]] + [[methyl|'''m'''ethyl]] + [[butyl|'''but'''yl]] + '''al''' (common suffix for barbiturates).<ref name=Nembutal>{{ cite pmid | 9281913 }}</ref>

==Uses==
===Medical===
Typical applications for pentobarbital are sedative, hypnotic for short term, preanesthetic and control of convulsions in emergencies. <ref>http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=f302ddf5-0213-43b3-b6c1-b3edf2bafbcd </ref>

It is also used as a veterinary anesthetic agent. <ref>{{cite web

| title = International

}}</ref>

Pentobarbital also has an application in reducing intracranial pressure in [[Reye's syndrome]], traumatic brain injury and induction of coma in [[cerebral ischemia]] patients.<ref name=monograph>

}}</ref> Pentobarbital-induced coma has been advocated in patients with acute liver failure refractory to [[mannitol]].<ref name=pentobarbital>{{ cite pmid | 17901832 }}</ref> 

===Death induction===
Pentobarbital can induce death when used in high doses. It is used for euthanasia for humans as well as animals. 

It is also used by itself, or in combination with complementary agents such as [[phenytoin]], in commercial [[animal euthanasia]] injectable solutions.

In the [[Netherlands]], the standard protocol for physician-assisted suicide is intravenously induced [[thiopental]] anesthesia, followed by bromide of [[alcuronium]] or [[pancuronium]] induced respiratory arrest. A concentrated oral solution of 100 ml containing 9 grams of pentobarbital sodium along with sugar syrup in a 20% ethanol solution is a standard solution used for self administration by patient. <ref name=netherlands>

The dosage of pentobarbital indicated for physical assisted suicide in Oregon, US is typically 10g in liquid form<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742070_3</ref>


==== Capital punishment ====
Pentobarbital is considered as the substitute to traditionally used pharmaceuticals by some State government of United States for execution due to a shortage in supply.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/21/politics/states-lethal-injection-drugs</ref>

The US state of [[Texas]] executed its first death row inmate with a single [[lethal injection]] of the sedative pentobarbital on July 18, 2012. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18897310 |title=Texas first single drug execution}}</ref> The sole use of Pentobarbital in [[U.S]] is set to become more widespread after several states, including [[Ohio]], [[Arizona]], [[Idaho]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] made the decision to switch following shortages of the [[Pancuronium bromide]], a muscle relaxant previously used as one component in a 3-drug cocktail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deathpenaltynews.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/texas-executes-yokamon-hearn.html |title=Texas executes Yokamon Hearn |deadurl=no |accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref>

==Metabolism==

Pentobarbital undergoes [[First pass effect|first-pass metabolism]] in the liver and possibly the intestines.<ref name=first-pass>
{{ cite pmid | 6777235 }}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Administration of [[alcohol]], [[opioid]]s, [[antihistamine]]s, other [[sedative|sedative-hypnotic]]s, and other [[central nervous system]] depressants will cause possible additive effects.<ref name=monograph/>

==Recreational use==
Pentobarbital is a drug that has been used recreationally.<ref>{{ cite pmid | 16336040 }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Pentobarbital is synthesized by methods analogous to that of [[amobarbital]], the only difference being that the alkylation of α-ethylmalonic ester is carried out with 2-bromopentane (not 1-bromo-3-methylbutane) to give pentobarbital.<ref>
