}}'''Amblyopia''', also known as '''lazy eye''', is an eye disorder characterized by an impaired vision in an eye that otherwise appears normal, or out of proportion to associated structural abnormalities of the eye. It has been estimated to affect 1-5% of the population.<ref name="asn" />

In amblyopia, visual stimulation either fails to transmit or is poorly transmitted through the optic nerve to the brain for a continuous period of time. It can also occur when the brain "turns off" the visual processing of one eye to prevent double-vision, for example in strabismus (crossed-eyes).  It often occurs during early childhood, resulting in poor or blurry vision.  Amblyopia normally affects only one eye in most patients. However, it is possible, though rare, to be amblyopic in both eyes, if both fail to receive clear visual images. 

Detecting the condition in early childhood increases the chance of successful treatment, especially if detected before the age of five.  The earlier it is detected, and the underlying cause corrected with spectacles and/or surgery, the more successful the treatment in equalizing vision between the two eyes. <ref name="pmid17304868" />

==Physiology==
Amblyopia is a developmental problem in the brain, not any intrinsic, organic neurological problem in the eyeball (although organic problems can lead to amblyopia which can continue to exist after the organic problem has resolved by medical intervention).<ref name="Mckee" />
The part of the brain receiving images from the affected eye is not stimulated properly and does not develop to its full visual potential.  This has been confirmed by direct brain examination.  [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1981 for their work in showing the irreversible damage to [[ocular dominance columns]] produced in kittens by sufficient visual deprivation during the so-called "critical period." The maximum "critical period" in humans is from birth to two years old.<ref name=Cooper />
==Symptoms==
Many people with amblyopia, especially those who only have a mild form, are not even aware they have the condition until tested at older ages, since the vision in their stronger eye is normal. However, people who have ''severe'' amblyopia may experience related visual disorders, most notably poor [[depth perception]]. Amblyopes may suffer from poor spatial [[Visual acuity|acuity]], low sensitivity to [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] and some "higher-level" deficits to vision such as reduced sensitivity to [[Motion perception|motion]].<ref name="Hess" />
These deficits are usually specific to the amblyopic eye. Amblyopes also suffer from problems of [[Binocular vision|binocular]] vision such as limited stereoscopic depth perception and usually have difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as [[autostereogram]]s.<ref name="Tyler" />
However, perception of depth from monocular cues such as size, [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], and [[Parallax|motion parallax]] remains normal.

==Types==
Amblyopia has three main causes:
* Strabismic: by [[strabismus]] (misaligned eyes)
* Refractive: by [[anisometropia]] (high degrees of [[myopia|nearsightedness]], [[hypermetropia|farsightedness]], or [[astigmatism]] in one or both eyes)
* Deprivational: by deprivation of vision early in life by vision-obstructing disorders such as [[congenital cataract]]

===Strabismic amblyopia===
{{Main|Strabismus}}
[[File:Child eyepatch.jpg|right|thumb|A child wearing an adhesive eyepatch to correct amblyopia]]
[[Strabismus]], sometimes also called ''lazy eye'', is a condition in which the eyes are misaligned.<ref name=handbook /> Strabismus usually results in normal vision in the preferred sighting (or "fellow") eye (the eye that the person prefers to use), but may cause abnormal vision in the deviating or strabismic eye due to the difference between the images projecting to the brain from the two eyes.<ref name="Levi" />
Adult-onset strabismus usually causes double vision ([[diplopia]]), since the two eyes are not fixed on the same object.
Children's brains, however, are more [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplastic]], and therefore can more easily adapt by [[Suppression (eye)|suppressing images]] from one of the eyes, eliminating the double vision. This plastic response of the brain, however, interrupts the brain's normal development, resulting in the amblyopia.
Strabismic amblyopia is treated by clarifying the visual image with glasses, and/or encouraging use of the amblyopic eye with an [[eyepatch]] over the dominant eye or [[Atropine#Ophthalmic_use|pharmacologic penalization]] of the better eye. Penalization usually consists of applying [[atropine]] drops to temporarily dilate the [[pupil]], which leads to blurring of vision in the good eye. This helps to prevent the bullying and teasing associated with wearing a patch, although sometimes application of the eyedrops is more challenging. The ocular alignment itself may be treated with surgical or non-surgical methods, depending on the type and severity of the [[strabismus]].<ref name="Holmes" />

===Refractive or anisometropic amblyopia===
Refractive amblyopia may result from [[anisometropia]] (unequal refractive error between the two eyes). Anisometropia exists when there is a difference in the [[refractive error|power]] between the two eyes. The eye which provides the brain with a clearer image typically becomes the dominant eye. The image in the other eye is blurred, which results in abnormal development of one half of the visual system. Refractive amblyopia is usually less severe than strabismic amblyopia and is commonly missed by [[primary care physician]]s because of its less dramatic appearance and lack of obvious physical manifestation, such as with strabismus.<ref name=AAFP />

Frequently, amblyopia is associated with a combination of anisometropia and strabismus. In some cases the vision between the eyes can differ to the point where one eye has twice average vision while the other eye is completely blind.

=== Deprivation and occlusion amblyopia ===
Deprivation amblyopia (''Amblyopia ex anopsia'') results when the ocular media become [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], such as is the case with [[congenital cataract]] or [[cornea|corneal]] haziness.<ref name=Angell /> These opacities prevent adequate visual input from reaching the eye, and therefore disrupt development. If not treated in a timely fashion, amblyopia may persist even after the cause of the opacity is removed. Sometimes, drooping of the [[eyelid]] ([[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]) or some other problem causes the upper eyelid to physically occlude a child's vision, which may cause amblyopia quickly.  Occlusion amblyopia may be a complication of a [[hemangioma]] that blocks some or all of the eye.

==Treatment and prognosis==
===Treatments===
Treatment of ''strabismic'' or ''anisometropic amblyopia'' consists of correcting the optical deficit (wearing the necessary spectacle prescription) and often forcing use of the amblyopic eye, either by [[Eyepatch|patching]] the good eye, or by instilling [[topical]] [[atropine]] in the good eye.<ref>''Handbook'', p. 127</ref> Yet, there is a drawback as the drops can have a side-effect of creating nodules in the eye which a correctional ointment can counteract. One should also be wary of over-patching or over-penalizing the good eye when treating for amblyopia, as this can create so-called "reverse amblyopia".<ref name="Holmes" /><ref name=NEI /> Eye patching is usually applied on a part-time schedule, that is about 4-6 hours a day. Treatment is continued as long as vision improves. It is not worthwhile continuing to patch for more than 6 months if there is no improvement.<ref name=vaughan /> 

Treatment of individuals age 9 through adult is possible through applied [[perceptual learning]].<ref name=zhou /><ref name=polat />

''Deprivation amblyopia'' is treated by removing the opacity as soon as possible followed by patching or penalizing the good eye to encourage use of the amblyopic eye.<ref name="Holmes" /> The earlier treatment is initiated, the easier and faster the treatment is and the less psychologically damaging. There is also a greater chance of achieving 20/20 vision if treatment is initiated as early as possible.<ref name=wiliams />

=== Clinical trials and experiments ===
Although the best outcome is achieved if treatment is started before age 8, research has shown that children older than age 12 and some adults can show improvement in the affected eye.  Children from 9 to 11 who wore an eye patch and performed near point activities ([[vision therapy]]) were four times as likely to show a two line improvement on a standard 11 line [[Snellen chart|eye chart]] than amblyopic children who did not receive treatment.  Adolescents aged 13 to 17 showed improvement as well, albeit in smaller amounts than younger children.  It is uncertain whether such improvements are only temporary, however, particularly if treatment is discontinued.<ref name="Holmes" /><ref name="PEDIG" />

For adults, a 2004 study published in [[PNAS]] demonstrated that perceptual learning can be used to improve the vision of amblyopic adults.<ref name="PNAS2004" />

Virtual reality computer games where each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to successfully play the game have shown some promise in improving both monocularity in the affected eye as well as [[binocularity]].<ref name=bbc /><ref name=Eastgate />

A study,<ref name=Thompson /> widely reported in the popular press,<ref name=rTMS /> has suggested that repetitive [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] may temporarily improve contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution in the affected eye of amblyopic adults. These results await verification by other researchers.

The most recent study <ref name=Li /> suggests that playing the popular game Tetris may help to treat this condition.
