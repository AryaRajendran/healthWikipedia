The '''vertebral arteries''' are major [[artery|arteries]] of the neck. They branch from the [[subclavian artery|subclavian arteries]] and merge to form the single midline [[basilar artery]] in a complex called the ''vertebrobasilar system'', which supplies blood to the posterior part of the [[circle of Willis]] and thus significant portions of the [[brain]].

==Course==
The vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries, one on each side of the body, then enter deep to the transverse process of the level of the 6th [[cervical vertebrae]] (C6), or occasionally (in 7.5% of cases) at the level of C7.  They then proceed superiorly, in the [[transverse foramen]] (foramen transversarium) of each [[cervical vertebra]] until C1. This path is largely parallel to, but distinct from, the route of the [[carotid artery]] ascending through the neck. At the C1 level, the vertebral arteries travel across the posterior arch of the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] through the [[suboccipital triangle]] before entering the [[foramen magnum]].
[[Nunziante Ippolito]], a neapolitan physician, indicated the  "angle of Nunziante Ippolito" to find vertebral artery, between anterior scalene muscle and Longus colli muscle.<ref>http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/nunziante-ippolito_%28Dizionario_Biografico%29/</ref>

Inside the skull, the two vertebral arteries join up to form the [[basilar artery]] at the base of the [[medulla oblongata]]. The [[basilar artery]] is the main blood supply to the [[brainstem]] and connects to the [[Circle of Willis]] to potentially supply the rest of the brain if there is compromise to one of the [[carotid artery|carotids]]. At each cervical level, the vertebral artery sends branches to the surrounding musculature via [[anterior spinal arteries]].

The branches of the subclavian artery are: 
1. Vertebral;
2. Internal mammary;
3. Thyrocervical; 
4. Costocervical;
5. Descending or Dorsal scapular artery (50% of the time).

==Division into four parts==
[[Image:Vertebral artery 3D AP.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Segments]]
The vertebral artery may be divided into four parts: 

===First part===
The first part runs upward and backward between the [[Longus colli]] and the [[Scalenus anterior]]. 

In front of it are the [[internal jugular]] and [[vertebral vein]]s, and it is crossed by the [[inferior thyroid artery]]; the left vertebral is crossed by the [[thoracic duct]] also. 

Behind it are the transverse process of the seventh [[cervical vertebra]], the [[sympathetic trunk]] and its [[inferior cervical ganglion]].

===Second part===

The second part runs upward through the [[Vertebral foramen|foramina]] in the [[transverse processes]] of the C6 to C2 vertebræ, and is surrounded by branches from the inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion and by a plexus of veins which unite to form the vertebral vein at the lower part of the neck. 

It is situated in front of the trunks of the cervical nerves, and pursues an almost vertical course as far as the [[transverse process of the axis]].

===Third part===
The third part issues from the C2 foramen transversarium on the medial side of the [[Rectus capitis lateralis]]. It is further subdvided into the vertical part V3v passing vertically upwards, crossing the C2 root and entering the foramen transversarium of C1, and the horizontal part V3h,  curving medially and posteriorly behind the [[superior articular process of the atlas]], the anterior ramus of the first cervical nerve being on its medial side; it then lies in the groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of the atlas, and enters the vertebral canal by passing beneath the [[posterior atlantoöccipital membrane]]. 

This part of the artery is covered by the [[Semispinalis capitis]] and is contained in the [[suboccipital triangle]]—a triangular space bounded by the [[Rectus capitis posterior major]], the [[Obliquus superior]], and the [[Obliquus inferior]]. 

The first cervical or [[suboccipital nerve]] lies between the artery and the [[posterior arch]] of the atlas.

===Fourth part===
The fourth part pierces the [[dura mater]] and inclines medialward to the front of the [[medulla oblongata]]; it is placed between the [[hypoglossal nerve]] and the anterior root of the first cervical nerve and beneath the first digitation of the [[ligamentum denticulatum]]. 

At the lower border of the [[pons]] it unites with the vessel of the opposite side to form the [[basilar artery]].

==Variations==
The left vertebral artery is usually larger and [[volumetric flow rate|carries more blood]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Albayrak, Ramazan|title=Doppler sonography evaluation of flow velocity and volume of the extracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries in healthy adults |journal=J Clin Ultrasound |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=2007 |pmid=17149761|doi=10.1002/jcu.20301 |last2= Degirmenci |first2= B |last3= Acar |first3= M |last4= Haktanir |first4= A |last5= Colbay |first5= M |last6= Yaman |first6= M}}</ref> In 3-15% of the population, a bony bridge called the [[arcuate foramen]] covers the groove for the vertebral artery on vertebra C1.
