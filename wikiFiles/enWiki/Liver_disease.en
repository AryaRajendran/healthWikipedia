'''Liver disease''' (also called hepatic disease) is a type of damage to or [[disease]] of the [[liver]].

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms related to liver dysfunction include both physical signs and a variety of [[symptom]]s related to digestive problems, blood sugar problems, [[immune disorder]]s, abnormal absorption of fats, and metabolism problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The malabsorption of fats may lead to symptoms that include indigestion, reflux, deficit of fat-soluble vitamins, [[hemorrhoid]]s, [[gall stone]]s, intolerance to fatty foods, intolerance to alcohol, nausea and vomiting attacks, abdominal bloating, and [[constipation]].

Nervous system disorders include depression, mood changes, especially anger and irritability, poor concentration and "[[foggy brain]]", overheating of the body, especially the face and torso, and recurrent headaches (including migraine) associated with nausea.

The blood sugar problems include [[hypoglycaemia]].

Abnormalities in the level of fats in the blood stream, whether too high or too low levels of lipids in the organism.  [[Hypercholesterolemia]]: elevated LDL [[cholesterol]], reduced HDL cholesterol, elevated [[triglyceride]]s, clogged arteries leading to high [[blood pressure]], [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s, build up of fat in other body organs (fatty degeneration of organs), lumps of fat in the skin (lipomas and other fatty tumors), excessive weight gain (which may lead to obesity), inability to lose weight even while dieting, sluggish metabolism, protuberant abdomen (pot belly), [[cellulite]], fatty liver, and a roll of fat around the upper abdomen (liver roll) etc.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Or too low levels of lipids: [[hypocholesterolemia]]: low total cholesterol, low LDL and VLDL cholesterol, low triglyderides.

==Types==
* [[Hepatitis]], inflammation of the liver, is caused mainly by various viruses ([[viral hepatitis]]) but also by some [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxins]] (e.g. [[alcoholic hepatitis]]), autoimmunity ([[autoimmune hepatitis]]) or hereditary conditions.
* [[Alcoholic liver disease]] is any hepatic manifestation of [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol overconsumption]], including [[fatty liver|fatty liver disease]], alcoholic hepatitis, and [[cirrhosis]]. Analogous terms such as "drug-induced" or "toxic" liver disease are also used to refer to the range of disorders caused by various drugs and environmental chemicals.
* Fatty liver disease (hepatic [[steatosis]]) is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of [[triglyceride]] fat accumulate in liver cells. [[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]] is a spectrum of disease associated with obesity and [[metabolic syndrome]], among other causes. Fatty liver may lead to inflammatory disease (i.e. [[steatohepatitis]]) and, eventually, cirrhosis.
* Cirrhosis is the formation of fibrous tissue ([[fibrosis]]) in the place of liver cells that have died due to a variety of causes, including viral hepatitis, alcohol overconsumption, and other forms of liver toxicity. Cirrhosis causes chronic [[liver failure]].
* Primary [[liver cancer]] most commonly manifests as [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] and/or [[cholangiocarcinoma]]; rarer forms include [[angiosarcoma]] and [[hemangiosarcoma]] of the liver. (Many liver malignancies are secondary lesions that have metastasized from primary cancers in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, such as the kidneys, lungs, breast, or prostate.)
* [[Primary biliary cirrhosis]] is a serious [[autoimmune]] disease of the [[bile canaliculus|bile capillaries]].
* [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is a serious chronic [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disease of the [[bile duct]], which is believed to be autoimmune in origin.
* [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]] is the clinical picture caused by [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the [[hepatic vein]], which in some cases may lead to cirrhosis.
* [[Hereditary disease]]s that cause damage to the liver include [[hemochromatosis]], involving accumulation of [[iron]] in the body, and [[Wilson's disease]], which causes the body to retain [[copper]]. Liver damage is also a clinical feature of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] and [[glycogen storage disease type II]].
* In [[transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis]], the liver produces a mutated transthyretin protein which has severe neurodegenerative and/or cardiopathic effects. Liver transplantation can provide a curative treatment option.
* [[Gilbert's syndrome]], a genetic disorder of [[bilirubin]] metabolism found in about 5% of the population, can cause mild [[jaundice]].

There are also many pediatric liver disease, including [[biliary atresia]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[alagille syndrome]], [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]] to name but a few.
The most effective way to treat alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is to make lifestyle changes, such as:

Cutting out alcohol.
Improving your diet.
Taking regular exercise.
Anti-viral medications are available to treat infections such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. This is an area of active research and drug development and today many treatments offer improved outcomes, by clearing or controlling the virus to slow any decline in the condition of your liver.

Other conditions may be managed by slowing down disease progression:

By using steroid-based drugs in autoimmune hepatitis.
Regularly removing a quantity of blood from a vein (venesection) in the iron overload condition, haemochromatosis.
Wilsonâ€™s disease, a condition where copper builds up in the body, can be managed with drugs which bind copper allowing it to be passed from your body in urine.
In cholestatic liver disease (where the flow of bile is affected) a medication called ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO, also referred to as UDCA) may be given. Made from naturally occurring bile acid, it may offer some protection for the liver from the harmful chemicals in the bile, slowing damage.

==Diagnostics==
A number of [[liver function tests]] are available to test the proper function of the liver. These test for the presence of [[enzyme]]s in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue, metabolites or products.
LFT's, [[Blood proteins|serum proteins]], [[serum albumin]], [[Globulin|serum globulin]], A/G Ratio,
[[alanine transaminase]], [[aspartate transaminase]], [[prothrombin time]], [[partial thromboplastin time]], [[platelet count]].
