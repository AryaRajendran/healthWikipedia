In [[medicine]], a '''side effect''' is an effect, whether therapeutic or adverse, that is secondary to the one intended; although the term is predominantly employed to describe [[adverse effect]]s, it can also apply to beneficial, but unintended, consequences of the use of a [[drug]].

Occasionally, drugs are prescribed or procedures performed specifically for their side effects; in that case, said side effect ceases to be a side effect, and is now an intended effect.  For instance, [[X-ray]]s were historically (and are currently) used as an imaging technique; the discovery of their oncolytic capability led to their employ in [[radiotherapy]] (ablation of [[malignancy|malignant]] [[tumour]]s).

Use of drugs for unapproved indications—that is, for their side effects—is termed [[off-label use]]. For instance, opioids, which are approved as [[palliative care|palliative]] treatment for [[pain]], may also be used for their [[euphoriant]] properties as [[anxiolytics]] or [[antidepressants]], whether medically or [[recreational drug use|recreationally]].

Off-label use of drugs, although similar in meaning to side effects, is not to be confused with them; side effects describe the [[mechanism of action]] that a drug used off-label takes, whereas off-label use implies the desired consequences of using a drug for its side-effects.

Off-label use of drugs is legal; the manner in which prescription medication is to be used is solely at the discretion of the [[physician|prescriber]]. However, the marketing of drugs towards unapproved indications is illegal; in fact, several pharmaceutical development firms have been fined for unapproved promotion of their products.

==Examples of therapeutic side-effects==
* [[Bevacizumab]] ([[Avastin]]) has been used against dry age-related [[macular degeneration]], as well as [[macular edema]] from diseases such as [[diabetic retinopathy]] and [[central retinal vein occlusion]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,,1799772,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Drugs firm blocks cheap blindness cure | first=Sarah | last=Boseley | date=2006-06-17 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>
*[[Buprenorphine#Antidepressant features|Buprenorphine]] has been shown experimentally (1982–1995) to be effective against severe, refractory depression.<ref>Richard Gracer [http://www.naabt.org/documents/The_Buprenorphine_effect_on_Depression.pdf The Buprenorphine Effect on Depression].

* [[Bupropion]], an [[anti-depressant]] sold as Wellbutrin, is also used as a smoking cessation aid; this indication was later approved, and the name of the smoking cessation product is Zyban. In Ontario, Canada, smoking cessation drugs are not covered by provincial drug plans; elsewhere, Zyban is priced higher than Wellbutrin, despite being the same drug. Therefore, some physicians prescribe Wellbutrin for both indications.
* [[Sildenafil]] was originally intended for [[pulmonary hypertension]]; subsequently, it was discovered that it also produces [[erection]]s, for which it was later marketed.
* [[Carbamazepine]] is an approved treatment for [[manic depression]] and [[convulsions]], but has side effects useful in treating [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[schizophrenia]], [[phantom limb]] syndrome, [[paroxysmal extreme pain disorder]], [[neuromyotonia]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref>[http://www.leeheymd.com/charts/dep4_1.html Mood Stabilizers for Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depressive)].

* [[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] is a hormone produced during pregnancy by the cells that form the placenta. It has been used as a diet hormone as well because of the supposed positive side effects it has on weight loss.
