In the early 1980s, university-based ophthalmologists in the USA and Canada further refined the use of botulinum toxin as a therapeutic agent. By 1985, a scientific protocol of injection sites and dosage had been empirically determined for treatment of [[blepharospasm]] and [[strabismus]].<ref>

In 1986, Scott's micromanufacturer and distributor of Botox was no longer able to supply the drug because of an inability to obtain product liability insurance. Patients became desperate, as supplies of Botox were gradually consumed, forcing him to abandon patients who would have been due for their next injection. For a period of four months, American blepharospasm patients had to arrange to have their injections performed by participating doctors at Canadian eye centers until the liability issues could be resolved.<ref>

===Upper motor neuron syndrome===
BTX-A is now a common treatment for muscles affected by the [[upper motor neuron]] syndrome (UMNS), such as [[cerebral palsy]], for muscles with an impaired ability to effectively [[Eccentric contraction|lengthen]]. Muscles affected by UMNS frequently are limited by [[weakness]], loss of [[reciprocal inhibition]], decreased movement control and hypertonicity (including [[spasticity]]). Joint motion may be restricted by severe muscle imbalance related to the syndrome, when some muscles are markedly hypertonic, and lack effective active lengthening. Injecting an overactive muscle to decrease its level of contraction can allow improved reciprocal motion, so improved ability to move and exercise.

===Sweating===
While treating patients with hemifacial spasm at Southend Hospital in England in 1993, Khalaf Bushara and David Park were the first to show  botulinum toxin injections inhibit sweating.<ref name="Bushara KO, Park DM. 1437–1438"/> This was the first demonstration of nonmuscular use of BTX-A. Bushara further showed the efficacy of botulinum toxin in treating [[hyperhidrosis]] (excessive sweating). BTX-A was later approved for the treatment of excessive underarm sweating. This is technically known as severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis - excessive underarm sweating with an unknown cause which cannot be managed by topical agents.

===Cervical dystonia===
Botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B) received FDA approval for treatment of cervical [[dystonia]] on December 21, 2000. Trade names for BTX-B are Myobloc in the United States, and Neurobloc in the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Chronic migraine===
Onabotulinumtoxin A (trade name Botox) received FDA approval for treatment of chronic [[migraines]] on October 15, 2010. The toxin is injected into the head and neck to treat these chronic headaches.

==Chemical overview==
The seven serologically distinct toxin types are designated A through G. Additionally, six of the seven toxin types have subtypes with five subtypes of BoNT A having been described. The toxin is a two-chain [[polypeptide]] with a 100-[[dalton (unit)|kDa]] heavy chain joined by a [[disulfide bond]] to a 50-kDa light chain. This light chain is an enzyme (a [[protease]]) that attacks one of the fusion proteins (SNAP-25, syntaxin or synaptobrevin) at a [[neuromuscular junction]], preventing [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s from anchoring to the [[cell membrane|membrane]] to release [[acetylcholine]]. By inhibiting acetylcholine release, the toxin interferes with nerve impulses and causes flaccid (sagging) paralysis of muscles in [[botulism]], as opposed to the spastic paralysis seen in [[tetanus]].

Botulinum toxin is [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] at temperatures greater than {{convert|80|C|F}}.<ref>

Foodborne botulism can be transmitted through food that has not been heated correctly prior to being canned or food that was not cooked correctly from a can. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that cause this disease are in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that cause infant botulism, so children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons one year of age and older.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/ CDC – Botulism, General Information – NCZVED]. Cdc.gov. Retrieved on 2012-05-06.</ref>

Food-borne botulism usually results from ingestion of food that has become contaminated with spores (such as a perforated can)  that provides 
an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic environment]], allowing the spores to germinate and grow.  The growing (vegetative) bacteria produce toxin. It is the ingestion of toxin that causes [[botulism]], not the ingestion of the spores or the vegetative bacteria. Infant and wound botulism both result from infection with spores, which subsequently germinate, resulting in production of toxin and the symptoms of botulism.

Proper refrigeration at temperatures below 3°C (38°F) retards the growth of ''Clostridium botulinum''. The organism is also susceptible to high salt, high oxygen, and low pH levels. The toxin itself is rapidly destroyed by heat, such as in thorough cooking.<ref>

===Links to deaths===
In September 2005, a paper published in the ''Journal of American Academy of Dermatology'' reported from the FDA saying that use of Botox has resulted in 28 deaths between 1989 and 2003, though none were attributed to cosmetic use.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite journal|author=Coté TR, Mohan AK, Polder JA, Walton MK, Braun MM |title=Botulinum toxin type A injections: adverse events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration in therapeutic and cosmetic cases |journal=J.

On February 8, 2008, the FDA announced Botox has "been linked in some cases to adverse reactions, including respiratory failure and death, following treatment of a variety of conditions using a wide range of doses", due to its ability to spread to areas distant from the site of the injection.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116857.htm FDA Notifies Public of Adverse Reactions Linked to Botox Use]. Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2012-05-06.</ref> In April 2009, the FDA updated its mandatory boxed warning cautioning that the effects of the botulinum toxin may spread from the area of injection to other areas of the body, causing symptoms similar to those of botulism.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2009/ucm175013.htm FDA Gives Update on Botulinum Toxin Safety Warnings; Established Names of Drugs Changed], FDA Press Announcement, August 3, 2009</ref>

In January 2009, the Canadian government warned that Botox can have the adverse effect of spreading to other parts of the body, which could cause muscle weakness, swallowing difficulties, pneumonia, speech disorders and breathing problems.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/01/13/botox.html | work=CBC News | title=Botox chemical may spread, Health Canada confirms | date=2009-01-13}}</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jjXaXXB231Ty8J7Sbi8yeN0EH5tA Le Canada met en garde contre les effets dangereux du Botox] (French)</ref>

===Side effects===
Side effects, which are generally minor and temporary,<ref name=bcm/> can be predicted from the mode of action (muscle paralysis) and chemical structure (protein) of the molecule, resulting, broadly speaking, in two major areas of side effects: paralysis of the wrong muscle group and allergic reaction. Bruising at the site of injection is a side effect not of the toxin, but rather the mode of administration. In cosmetic use, this can result in inappropriate facial expression, such as drooping eyelid,<ref name=bcm/> double vision,<ref name=bcm/> uneven smile, or loss of the ability to close eyes. This will wear off in around six weeks. Bruising is prevented by the clinician applying pressure to the injection site, but may still occur, and will last around seven to 11 days. When injecting the masseter muscle of the jaw, loss of muscle function will result in a loss or reduction of power to chew solid foods.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> All cosmetic treatments are of limited duration, and can be as short as six weeks, but usually the effective period lasts from two to three months.  At the extremely low doses used medicinally, botulinum toxin has a very low degree of human and animal toxicity.

Other adverse events from cosmetic use include headaches, [[dysphagia]], flu-like syndromes, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, allergic reactions and swelling or redness at the injection site.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>[http://www.botoxguide.org/ Botox Side Effects]. Botoxguide.org. Retrieved on 2012-05-06.</ref>

A petition by [[Public Citizen]] to the FDA has requested regulatory action concerning the possible spread of botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc) from the site of injection to other parts of the body.<ref>HRG Publication #1834): [http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7559&secID=1680&catID=126 Public Citizen]</ref>

Individuals who are pregnant, have egg allergies or a neuromuscular disorder are advised to avoid Botox.<ref name=bcm/>

<!-- in cite As published in Forbes and originally published in the journal Social Psychology and Personality Science, -->Botox takes away or dampens the emotional feelings in a particular situation. That may be due to less interaction between facial muscle movement and brain. According to David Neal, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California, “if muscular signals from the face to the brain are dampened, you’re less able to read emotions.”<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.forbes.com/marcbabej/2011/04/23/botox-may-deaden-ability-to-empathize-new-study-says/?partner=following_topic_daily | work=Forbes | title = Botox May Deaden Ability to Empathize, New Study Says | date = Apr. 23, 2011}}</ref>

One way botox might affect emotional feelings is by dampening the relay of signals from the face to the amygdala and brainstem centers for autonomic arousal.<ref>{{cite journal |title = The link between facial feedback and neural activity within central circuitries of emotion – New insights from botulinum toxin-induced denervation of frown muscles  |journal = Cerebral Cortex |volume=June 17 |year=2008 |author = Hennenlotter, A.}}</ref>

The mental effects of botox may extend beyond emotional feelings to the ability to understand language about emotions.  An experimental study suggests the cosmetic use of botulinum toxin for treatment of glabellar lines affects human cognition. Havas and colleagues<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/31/health/la-he-botox-20100531 | work=LATimes | title = A Botox Gap in Understanding Emotion | date = May 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Havas DA, Glenberg AM, Gutowski KA, Lucarelli MJ, Davidson RJ |title=Cosmetic use of botulinum toxin-A affects processing of emotional language |journal=Psychological Science. |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=895–900 |year=2010 |month=September |url=|pmid=20548056|pmc=3070188 |doi=10.1177/0956797610374742}}</ref> asked subjects to read emotional (angry, sad, happy) sentences before and two weeks after Botox injections in the corrugator supercilii muscle used in frowning. Reading times for angry and sad sentences were longer after injection than before injection, while reading times for happy sentences were unchanged. This finding suggests  facial muscle paralysis has a selective effect in human cognition, and shows Botox hinders the ability to understand language. According to the lead researcher in this study, "[B]otox causes a kind of mild, temporary, cognitive blindness to information in the world, social information about the emotions of other people."

==Biochemical mechanism of toxicity==
[[Image:Presynaptic CNTs targets.svg|thumb|right|300px|Target molecules of botulinum (BoNT) and tetanus (TeNT) toxins inside the axon terminal.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no10/04-1279.htm Volume 11, Number 10 – October 2005 – Emerging Infectious Disease journal – CDC]. Cdc.gov (2012-02-22). Retrieved on 2012-05-06.</ref>]]
The heavy chain of the toxin is particularly important for targeting the toxin to specific types of [[axon]] terminals. The toxin must get inside the axon terminals to cause paralysis. Following the attachment of the toxin heavy chain to proteins on the surface of axon terminals, the toxin can be taken into neurons by [[endocytosis]]. The light chain is able to cleave endocytotic vesicles and reach the [[cytoplasm]]. The light chain of the toxin has protease activity. The type A toxin proteolytically degrades the [[SNAP-25|SNAP-25 protein]], a type of [[SNARE protein]]. The SNAP-25 protein is required for [[vesicle fusion]] that releases [[neurotransmitter]]s from the axon endings (in particular acetylcholine).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Foran PG |title=Evaluation of the therapeutic usefulness of botulinum neurotoxin B, C1, E, and F compared with the long lasting type A.

Though it affects the nervous system, common nerve agent treatments (namely the injection of [[atropine]] and [[pralidoxime]]) will increase mortality by enhancing botulin toxin's mechanism of toxicity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Attacks involving botulinum toxin are distinguishable from those involving nerve agent in that [[NBC (weapon)|NBC]] detection equipment (such as M-8 paper or the ICAM) will not indicate a "positive" when a sample of the agent is tested.  Furthermore, botulism symptoms develop relatively slowly, over several days compared to nerve agent effects, which can be instantaneous.

==Treatment of botulinum poisoning==
If the symptoms of botulism are diagnosed early, an equine antitoxin, use of enemas, and [[extracorporeal]] removal of the gut contents can be used to treat the food-borne illness.  Wound infections can be treated surgically.  Information regarding methods of safe canning, and public education about the disease are methods of prevention.  Tests to detect botulism include a brain scan, a nerve conduction test, and a tensilon test for myasthenia gravis to differentiate botulism from other diseases that manifest in the same way.  Electromyography can be used to differentiate [[myasthenia gravis]] and [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], diseases that botulism often mimics.  Toxicity testing of serum specimens, wound tissue cultures, and toxicity testing,  and stool specimen cultures are the best methods for identifying botulism.  Laboratory tests of the patient's serum or stool, which are then injected into mice, are also indicative of botulism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/files/botulism_manual.htm |title=Disease Listing, Botulism Manual, Additional Information |work= CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases |accessdate=2010-01-21 }}</ref> The faster way to detect botulinum toxin in people, though, is using the mass spectrometry technology, because it reduces testing time to three or four hours and at the same time it can identify the seven types of the toxin.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/washington/~cdcatWork/pdf/botulinum.pdf Developing a Faster Method for Measuring Botulinum Toxin in People]. cdc.gov.

The case fatality rate for botulinum poisoning between 1950 and 1996 was 15.5%, down from about 60% over the previous 50 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/files/botulism_manual.htm |title=Disease Listing, Botulism Manual, Additional Information  – CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases |accessdate=2007-08-14 |work=}}</ref>  Death is generally secondary to respiratory failure due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, so treatment consists of antitoxin administration and [[artificial ventilation]] until the neurotoxins are excreted or metabolised. If initiated on time, these treatments are quite effective, although antisera can not affect BoNT polypeptides that have already entered cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Turton K., Chaddock J.

Two primary botulinum antitoxins are available for treatment of botulism.

* [[valence (chemistry)|Trivalent]] (A,B,E) botulinum [[antitoxin]] is derived from equine sources using whole [[antibodies]] (Fab and Fc portions).  This antitoxin is available from the local health department via the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] in the USA.

* The second [[antitoxin]] is [[valence (chemistry)|Heptavalent]] (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) botulinum antitoxin, which is derived from "despeciated" equine IgG [[antibodies]], which have had the Fc portion cleaved off, leaving the F(ab')2 portions.  This  less immunogenic [[antitoxin]] is effective against all known strains of botulism where not contraindicated, and is available from the United States Army.  On June 1, 2006, the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]] awarded a $363 million contract with Cangene Corporation for 200,000 doses of heptavalent botulinum antitoxin over five years for delivery into the [[Strategic National Stockpile]] beginning in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmrs.fema.gov/news/publichealth/2006/aug/nph2006-08-03a.aspx |title=FEMA |accessdate=2007-08-14 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929111841/http://mmrs.fema.gov/news/publichealth/2006/aug/nph2006-08-03a.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref>

==Manufacturers==
In the United States, Botox is manufactured by [[Allergan, Inc.]] for both therapeutic and cosmetic use (100-unit). In 2011, Allergan required less than one gram of raw botulinum toxin neurotoxin to "supply the world's requirements for 25 indications approved by Government agencies around the world".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allergan.com/assets/pdf/2011AnnualReport.pdf |title=2011 Allergan Annual Report |publisher=[[Allergan]] |accessdate=3 May 2012}} See PDF page 7.</ref>

In the United States, Xeomin (manufactured in Germany by [[Merz Pharma|Merz]]) is available for both therapeutic and cosmetic use. Dysport, a therapeutic formulation of the type A toxin developed and manufactured in Ireland, is licensed for the treatment of focal dystonias and certain cosmetic uses in the US and worldwide in 100-, 300- and 500-unit packages.  Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products in China manufactures a BTX-A product, producing 50-unit and 100-unit type A toxin.<ref>
