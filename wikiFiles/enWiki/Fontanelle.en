A '''fontanelle''' (or '''fontanel''') is an [[human anatomy|anatomical]] feature on an infant's [[human skull|skull]] comprised by any of the soft [[Membrane|membranous]] gaps between the incompletely formed [[Skull|cranial bones]] of a [[Fetus|foetus]] or an [[infant]].<ref name=TheFreeDictionary>{{cite web|title=fontanelle|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fontanelle|publisher=TheFreeDictionary|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref> Fontanelles allow for rapid stretching and deformation of the cranium as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow.<ref name=CARTA>{{cite web|last=Beasley|first=Melanie|title=Age of Closure of Fontanelles / Sutures|url=http://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/age-closure-fontanelles-sutures|publisher=The Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny (CARTA)|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref>

==Anatomy==
Fontanelles are soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The [[ossification]] of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 18 to 24 months.<ref>"USMLE Step 2: Secrets".editor1=Theodore X. O'Connell.editor2=Adam Brochert.book=USMLE Step 2: Secrets.ed=3rd.page=271</ref> The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the [[mastoid fontanelle]] and the [[sphenoidal fontanelle]] are also significant.

The skull of a newborn consists of five main bones: two [[frontal bone]]s, two [[parietal bone]]s, and one [[occipital bone]]. These are joined by fibrous [[sutures of skull|sutures]], which allow movement that facilitates [[childbirth]] and [[brain]] [[cell growth|growth]]. 

* At birth, the skull features a small '''[[posterior fontanelle]]''', an open area covered by a tough [[biological membrane|membrane]], where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the [[Lambda (anatomy)|lambda]]). This fontanelle usually closes during the first two to three months of an infant's life.  This is called intramembranous ossification.  The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.

* The much larger, diamond-shaped '''[[anterior fontanelle]]''' where the two frontal and two parietal bones join generally remains open until the child is about two years of age, however, in [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] it is often late in closing or may never close.  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle. 

* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).

==Closure==
===In humans===
In humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:<ref name=CARTA />
# Posterior fontanelle generally closes 2-3 months after birth,
# Sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth,
# Mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6-18 months after birth, and
# Anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 1-3 years of age.

===In other primates===
In apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.<ref name=CARTA />

===In dogs===
{{Quote|text=One of the more serious problems that can affect [[canidae|canine]]s is known as an "open fontanelle," which occurs when the skull bones at the top of the head fail to close. The problem is often found in conjunction with hydrocephalus, which is a condition in which too much fluid is found within and around the brain, placing pressure on the brain and surrounding tissues. Often the head will appear dome-shaped, and the open fontanelle is noticeable as a "soft spot" on the top of the dog's head. The fluid-filled spaces within the brain, known as ventricles, also become swollen. The increased pressure damages or prevents the development of brain tissue.<ref name=TerrificPets>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrificpets.com/articles/10266465.asp |title=Open Skull Bones May, May Not Be Sign of Deadly Disorder |publisher=Terrificpets.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>}}

Not all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.

==Clinical significance==
===General===
The fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is perfectly normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the [[meninges]]. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name - fontanelle means "little fountain."

Parents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called "soft-spots", the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.

Fontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]]. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.

===Pathological===
====Fontanelles - bulging====
A very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised [[intracranial pressure]]. It can occur due to:<ref name="MedlinePlus Fontanelles - bulging">{{cite web|title=Fontanelles - bulging|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003310.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine & National Institutes of Health|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> 
* Encephalitis - swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections
* Hydrocephalus - a buildup of fluid inside the skull
* Meningitis -- infection of the membranes covering the brain

====Fontanelles - sunken====
A sunken (also called "depressed") fontanelle indicates [[dehydration]] or [[malnutrition]].<ref name="MedlinePlus Fontanelles - sunken">{{cite web|title=Fontanelles - sunken|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003309.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine & National Institutes of Health|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

====Fontanelles - enlarged====
The fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like:<ref name="MedlinePlus Fontanelles - enlarged">{{cite web|title=Fontanelles - enlarged|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003311.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine & National Institutes of Health|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> 
* Down syndrome
* Hydrocephalus
* Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)
* Premature birth

Rarer causes include:<ref name="MedlinePlus Fontanelles - enlarged" />
* Achondroplasia
* Apert syndrome
* Cleidocranial dysostosis
* Congenital rubella
* Neonatal hypothyroidism
* Osteogenesis imperfecta
* Rickets
