'''Anti-transglutaminase antibodies''' (ATA) are [[autoantibodies]] against the [[transglutaminase]] protein. [[Antibodies]] serve an important role in the [[immune system]] by detecting cells and substances that the rest of the immune system then eliminates. These cells and substance can be foreign (for example, viruses) and also can be produced by the body (for example, cancer cells).  Antibodies against the body's own products are called [[autoantibodies]]. Autoantibodies can sometimes errantly be directed against healthy portions of the organism, causing [[autoimmune disease]]s.

ATA can be classified according to 2 different schemes: [[transglutaminase]] [[isoform]] and [[immunoglobulin]] reactivity subclass ([[IgA]], [[IgG]]) toward transglutaminases.

===Anti-tissue transglutaminase===
Antibodies to [[tissue transglutaminase]] (ATA or anti-tTG) are found in patients with several conditions, including [[coeliac disease]], [[juvenile diabetes]],<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19758209|year=2009|last1=Krause|first1=I|last2=Anaya|first2=JM|last3=Fraser|first3=A|last4=Barzilai|first4=O|last5=Ram|first5=M|last6=Abad|first6=V|last7=Arango|first7=A|last8=García|first8=J|last9=Shoenfeld|first9=Y|title=Anti-infectious antibodies and autoimmune-associated autoantibodies in patients with type I diabetes mellitus and their close family members|volume=1173|pages=633–9|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04619.x|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences}}</ref> [[inflammatory bowel disease]],<ref name="nature.com">{{cite journal|last=Farrace|first=MG|coauthors=Picarelli, A; Di Tola, M; Sabbatella, L; Marchione, OP; Ippolito, G; Piacentini, M|title=Presence of anti-"tissue" transglutaminase antibodies in inflammatory intestinal diseases: an apoptosis-associated event?|journal=Cell death and differentiation|date=2001 Jul|year=2001|volume=8|issue=7|pages=767–70|pmid=11464221|url=http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v8/n7/full/4400880a.html|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>  and various forms of [[arthritis]].<ref name=Teichmann>{{cite journal|last=Teichmann|first=Joachim|coauthors=Voglau, Marcus J.; Lange, Uwe|title=Antibodies to human tissue transglutaminase and alterations of vitamin D metabolism in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis|journal=Rheumatology International|date=13 October 2009|volume=30|issue=12|pages=1559–1563|doi=10.1007/s00296-009-1186-y|pmid=19823832|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19823832|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=Picarelli>{{cite journal|last=Picarelli|first=A|coauthors=Di Tola, M; Sabbatella, L; Vetrano, S; Anania, MC; Spadaro, A; Sorgi, ML; Taccari, E|title=Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in arthritic patients: a disease-specific finding?|journal=Clinical chemistry|date=2003 Dec|volume=49|issue=12|pages=2091–4|pmid=14633886|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2003.023234|url=http://www.clinchem.org/content/49/12/2091.full|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>  

In Coeliac Disease, ATA are involved in the destruction of the villous [[extracellular matrix]] and target the destruction of [[intestinal villi|intestinal villous]] [[epithelial cell]]s
by [[killer cell]]s. Deposits of anti-tTG in the intestinal [[epithelium]] predict coeliac disease.<ref name=Kaukinen>{{cite journal | author = Kaukinen K, Peraaho M, Collin P, Partanen J, Woolley N, Kaartinen T,  Nuuntinen T,  Halttunen T, Maki M, Korponay-Szabo I | title = Small-bowel mucosal tranglutaminase 2-specific IgA deposits in coeliac disease without villous atrophy: A Prospective and radmonized clinical study | journal = Scand J Gastroenterology | volume = 40 | pages = 564–572 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16036509 | doi = 10.1080/00365520510023422 | issue = 5}}</ref>

===Anti-endomysial reactivity===
The [[endomysium]] is a layer of connective tissue that ensheaths a muscle fiber.  The endomysium contains a form of transglutaminase called "tissue transglutaminase" or "tTG" for short, and antibodies that bind to this form of transglutaminase are called anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA). <ref name=EMAnegCD>{{cite journal |author=Salmi T, Collin P, Korponay-Szabó I, Laurila K, Partanen J, Huhtala H, Király R, Lorand L, Reunala T, Mäki M, Kaukinen K |title=Endomysial antibody‐negative coeliac disease: clinical characteristics and intestinal autoantibody deposits |journal=Gut |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=1746–53 |year=2006 |pmid=16571636 |doi=10.1136/gut.2005.071514 |pmc=1856451}}</ref> 
The antiendomysial antibody test is a histological assay for patient serum binding to [[Esophagus|esophageal]] tissue from primate. EMA are present in [[celiac disease]]. They do not cause any direct symptoms to muscles, but detection of EMA is useful in the diagnosis of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pruessner HT |title=Detecting celiac disease in your patients |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1023–34, 1039–41 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9518950 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980301ap/pruessn.html}}</ref>

===Anti-epidermal transglutaminase===
Antibodies to [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] transglutaminase (eTG, also [[keratinocyte transglutaminase]]) are the [[autoantibodies]] believed to cause [[dermatitis herpetiformis]].<ref name="pmid18503599">{{cite journal |author=Hull CM |title=Elevation of IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase antibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis |journal=Br.

==Immunoglobin subclass==
ATA [[IgA]] are more frequently found in Celiac Disease (CD); however, ATA [[IgG]] are found in CD and at higher levels when affected individual had the [[IgA-less phenotype]]. The IgA-less phenotype is more common in CD than the normal population; however, one [[haplotype]], [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5]] is found in most CD, has [[genetic linkage]] to the IgA-less [[gene]] location.

==Associated Conditions==

===Celiac Disease===
Most attention to anti-transglutaminase antibodies is given with respect to [[Celiac Disease]].  A recent study of children published in 2007 demonstrated that the level of ATA in correlates with the scalar Marsh score for the disease in the same patient.<ref name="pmid17428743">{{cite journal | author = Donaldson MR | title = Correlation of duodenal histology with tissue transglutaminase and endomysial antibody levels in pediatric celiac disease | journal = Clin.

Daniel | last9 = Neuhausen | first9 = Susan L.}}</ref>  See the Coeliac wiki article for more information.

High levels ([[titer]]s) of ATA are found in almost all instances of [[coeliac disease]].<ref name=Dieterich>{{cite journal | author = Dieterich W, Ehnis T, Bauer M, Donner P, Volta U, Riecken E, Schuppan D | title = Identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen of celiac disease | journal = Nat Med | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 797–801 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9212111 | doi = 10.1038/nm0797-797}}</ref> Given the association of ATA with coeliac disease, and the prevalence of the latter, it is estimated that ~1% of the population have potentially pathogenic levels of ATA.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
A study published in Nature in 2001 found high levels of  anti-transglutaminase antibodies in [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]] - specifically in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative rectocolitis.<ref name="nature.com"/>

===Arthritis===
Studies of patients with various forms of [[arthritis]] showed highly increased frequencies of antibodies against guinea pig transglutaminase, human recombinant transglutaminase and [[peptidylarginine deiminase]] type 4 (PAD4). This suggests a potential for crossreactive antibodies between anti-tTG and anti-PAD4.<ref name="pmid16539813">{{cite journal | author = Roth EB, Stenberg P, Book C, Sjöberg K | title = Antibodies against transglutaminases, peptidylarginine deiminase and citrulline in rheumatoid arthritis--new pathways to epitope spreading | journal = Clin.

==Mechanism of Autoimmunity==
The antibodies to tissue transglutaminase follow a complex pathway of generation. 
For most antigens, T-cells specific to those antigens develop, for autoimmunity
autoreactive T-cells are not suppressed or antigens escape the protective process. T-cells are stimulated by antigen, presented by MHC molecules (HLA in humans) and [[surface IgM]] on antigen reactive [[B-cell]]s. These T-helper cells then stimulate B-cells to multiply and mature into [[plasma cell]]s that make IgG to that protein. 

In the case of Coeliac Disease, the current understanding is that tTG autoimmunity arises when T-cells are generated against wheat gliadin and similar gluten proteins made by a class of grasses called ''[[Triticeae]]'', which includes wheat (See [[Wheat taxonomy]]), [[barley]], and [[rye]]. The T-cells are defined by the ability to react to [[HLA-DQ8]] and [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5]] restricted antigens and gliadin is one of the antigens. Gliadin is a favored dietary substrate for [[transglutaminase]] because of many [[enzyme]] reaction sites on gliadin. In disease, transglutaminase reacts with gliadin forming a [[covalent bond|linkage]].<ref name="pmid14747475">{{cite journal | author = Fleckenstein B, Qiao SW, Larsen MR, Jung G, Roepstorff P, Sollid LM | title = Molecular characterization of covalent complexes between tissue transglutaminase and gliadin peptides | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 279 | issue = 17 | pages = 17607–16 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14747475 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M310198200}}</ref> In forming this bond transglutaminase becomes linked to T-cell epitopes on gliadin. B-cells with surface IgM that react to transglutaminase can present it with bound gliadin peptides to T-cells which stimulate B-cell maturation and proliferation to plasma cells making IgA or IgM. 

'''ATA changes the behavior of tTG'''. Some studies have revealed that antibodies
increase the activity of tTG, instead of inhibiting activity as is commonly encountered with function alterning antibodies. A recent study has shown that ATA also modify and increase replication in intestinal epithileal cells, by apparently interacting with cell-surface transglutaminase.<ref name="pmid17408665">{{cite journal | author = Barone MV | title = Humoral immune response to tissue transglutaminase is related to epithelial cell proliferation in celiac disease | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 132 | issue = 4 | pages = 1245–53 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17408665 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.01.030 | author-separator = , | author2 = Caputo I | author3 = Ribecco MT | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Maglio | first4 = Maria | last5 = Marzari | first5 = Roberto | last6 = Sblattero | first6 = Daniele | last7 = Troncone | first7 = Riccardo | last8 = Auricchio | first8 = Salvatore | last9 = Esposito | first9 = Carla}}</ref>
