There are a number of documented cases of historical figures and distinguished members of society who were '''kidney stone formers'''. This condition is caused by nephrolithiasis, which are more commonly known as [[kidney stone]]s, or urolithiasis, where the stone forms in the urinary system. These are crystal deposits that can accrete in the [[urinary system]] when certain [[chemical substance]]s become concentrated in the [[urine]].<ref name=chiras2007>{{cite book

In certain cases, kidney stone formation played a pivotal role in history. Most notably, some members of the royalty and military leaders became debilitated at important moments, such as [[Napoleon III of France]]<ref name=Kertzer/> during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and [[Athenian]] commander [[Nicias]] in the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] of 415–3 BCE.<ref name=hanson/> Despite this condition,  artists such as [[Arthur Sullivan]]<ref name=sullivan/> and [[Michel de Montaigne]]<ref name=montaigne/> managed to produce historically distinguished works; providing an example of perseverance in the face of severe and chronic pain. The medical advances of the twentieth century have allowed patients to survive the condition, whereas in the past it may have proven debilitating or fatal (as shown by the examples below).<ref name=moran2006>{{cite conference
