==Description==
''Cannabis'' is an [[Annual plant|annual]], [[dioecious]], [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[herb]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Leaf shape|palmately compound]] or digitate, with [[Leaf margin|serrate]] [[leaflet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/termlf1.htm |title=Leaf Terminology (Part 1) |publisher=Waynesword.palomar.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite [[Phyllotaxis|leaf arrangement]] and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant.

[[File:Cannabis sativa leaf diagnostic venation 2012 01 23 0829 c.jpg|thumb|Underside of ''Cannabis sativa'' leaf, showing diagnostic venation]]The leaves have a peculiar and diagnostic venation pattern that enables persons poorly familiar with the plant to distinguish a ''Cannabis'' leaf from unrelated species that have confusingly similar leaves (see illustration). As is common in serrated leaves, each serration has a central vein extending to its tip. However,the serration vein originates from lower down the central vein of the leaflet, typically opposite to the position of, not the first notch down, but the next notch. This means that on its way from the midrib of the leaflet to the point of the serration, the vein serving the tip of the serration passes close by the intervening notch. Sometimes the vein will actually pass tangent to the notch, but often it will pass by at a small distance, and when that happens a spur vein (occasionally a pair of such spur veins) branches off and joins the leaf margin at the deepest point of the notch. This venation pattern varies slightly among varieties, but in general it enables one to tell ''Cannabis'' leaves from superficially similar leaves without difficulty and without special equipment. Tiny samples of ''Cannabis'' plants also can be identified with precision by microscopic examination of leaf cells and similar features, but that requires special expertise and equipment.<ref name= "WattPP">Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub.

===Early classifications===
[[File:Cannab2 new.png|thumb|225px|Relative size of varieties of ''Cannabis'']]

The ''Cannabis'' genus was first [[Scientific classification|classified]] using the "modern" system of taxonomic [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]] by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in 1753, who devised the system still in use for the naming of species.<ref name = "linnaeus1753">Linnaeus, C. 1753. ''Species Plantarum'' '''2''': 1027. Salvius, Stockholm. [Facsimile edition, 1957–1959. Ray Society, London, U.K.]</ref> He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named ''Cannabis sativa'' L. (L. stands for Linnaeus, and indicates the authority who first named the species). Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. In 1785, noted evolutionary biologist [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]] published a description of a second species of ''Cannabis'', which he named ''Cannabis indica'' Lam.<ref name = "lamarck1785">de Lamarck, J.B. 1785. ''Encyclopédie Méthodique de Botanique'', vol. 1, pt. 2. Paris, France, pp. 694–695</ref> Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. He described ''C. indica'' as having poorer fiber quality than ''C. sativa'', but greater utility as an [[Psychoactive drug|inebriant]]. Additional ''Cannabis'' species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names ''Cannabis chinensis'' Delile, and ''Cannabis gigantea'' Delile ex Vilmorin.<ref name = "small1976a">Small, E. and A. Cronquist. 1976. A practical and natural taxonomy for ''Cannabis''. ''Taxon'' '''25'''(4): 405–435.</ref> However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept was still widely accepted, except in the [[Soviet Union]] where ''Cannabis'' continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name ''Cannabis indica'' was listed in various [[Pharmacopoeia]]s, and was widely used to designate ''Cannabis'' suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations.<ref name = "winek1977">Winek, C. L. 1977. Some historical aspects of marijuana. ''Clinical Toxicology'' '''10'''(2): 243-253.</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Cannabis ruderalis.jpg|thumb|left|''Cannabis ruderalis'']]
In 1924, Russian botanist D.E. Janichevsky concluded that [[ruderal]] ''Cannabis'' in central Russia is either a variety of ''C. sativa'' or a separate species, and proposed ''C. sativa'' L. var. ''ruderalis'' Janisch. and ''Cannabis ruderalis'' Janisch. as alternative names.<ref name = small1975b/> In 1929, renowned plant explorer [[Nikolai Vavilov]] assigned wild or feral populations of ''Cannabis'' in Afghanistan to ''C. indica'' Lam. var. ''kafiristanica'' Vav., and ruderal populations in Europe to ''C. sativa'' L. var. ''spontanea'' Vav.<ref name="hillig2004a"/><ref name = small1976a/> In 1940, Russian botanists Serebriakova and Sizov proposed a complex classification in which they also recognized ''C. sativa'' and ''C. indica'' as separate species. Within ''C. sativa'' they recognized two subspecies: ''C. sativa'' L. subsp. ''culta'' Serebr. (consisting of cultivated plants), and ''C. sativa'' L. subsp. ''spontanea'' (Vav.) Serebr. (consisting of wild or feral plants). Serebriakova and Sizov split the two ''C. sativa'' subspecies into 13 varieties, including four distinct groups within subspecies ''culta''. However, they did not divide ''C. indica'' into subspecies or varieties.<ref name = small1975b/><ref name = "serebriakova1940">Serebriakova T. Ya. and I. A. Sizov. 1940. Cannabinaceae Lindl.

[in Russian]</ref> This excessive splitting of ''C. sativa'' proved too unwieldy, and never gained many adherents.

In the 1970s, the taxonomic classification of ''Cannabis'' took on added significance in North America. Laws prohibiting ''Cannabis'' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] specifically named products of ''C. sativa'' as prohibited materials. Enterprising attorneys for the defense in a few drug busts argued that the seized ''Cannabis'' material may not have been ''C. sativa'', and was therefore not prohibited by law. Attorneys on both sides recruited botanists to provide expert testimony. Among those testifying for the prosecution was Dr. Ernest Small, while [[Richard E. Schultes|Dr. Richard E. Schultes]] and others testified for the defense. The botanists engaged in heated debate (outside of court), and both camps impugned the other's integrity.<ref name = small1975a/><ref name = emboden1981a/> The defense attorneys were not often successful in winning their case, because the intent of the law was clear.<ref name = "watts2006">Watts, G. 2006.

Small & Cronq.<ref name = small1976a/> The authors hypothesized that the two subspecies diverged primarily as a result of human selection; ''C. sativa'' subsp. ''sativa'' was presumably [[Artificial selection|selected]] for traits that enhance fiber or seed production, whereas ''C. sativa'' subsp. ''indica'' was primarily selected for drug production. Within these two subspecies, Small and Cronquist described ''C. sativa'' L. subsp. ''sativa'' var. ''spontanea'' Vav. as a wild or escaped variety of low-intoxicant ''Cannabis'', and ''C. sativa'' subsp. ''indica'' var. ''kafiristanica'' (Vav.)

===Popular usage===
The scientific debate regarding taxonomy has had little effect on the terminology in widespread use among cultivators and users of drug-type ''Cannabis''. ''Cannabis'' aficionados recognize three distinct types based on such factors as morphology, [[Range (biology)|native range]], aroma, and subjective psychoactive characteristics. ''Sativa'' is the most widespread variety, which is usually tall, laxly branched, and found in warm lowland regions. ''Indica'' designates shorter, bushier plants adapted to cooler climates and highland environments. ''Ruderalis'' is the informal name for the short plants that grow wild in Europe and central Asia.

Breeders, seed companies, and cultivators of drug type ''Cannabis'' often describe the ancestry or gross [[phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics of [[cultivar]]s by categorizing them as "pure indica," "mostly indica," "indica/sativa," "mostly sativa", or "pure sativa."

One of the most popular and potent sativas in Africa is [[Malawi Gold]], locally known as ''chamba''. It is internationally known for its potency and its flavor.

It has been suggested that the presence of monoecy can be used to differentiate licit crops of monoecious hemp from illicit drug crops.<ref name = "mignoni1999"/> However, ''sativa'' strains often produce monoecious individuals, probably as a result of inbreeding.

===Mechanisms of sex determination===
''Cannabis'' has been described as having one of the most complicated mechanisms of [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] among the dioecious plants.<ref name = "truta2002a"/> Many models have been proposed to explain sex determination in ''Cannabis''.

Based on studies of sex reversal in [[hemp]], it was first reported by K. Hirata in 1924 that an [[XY sex-determination system]] is present.<ref name = "hirata1924"/> At the time, the XY system was the only known system of sex determination. The [[X0 sex-determination system|X:A system]] was first described in Drosophila spp in 1925.<ref name = "bridges1925">Bridges, C. B. 1925. Sex in relation to chromosomes and genes.

Since then, many different types of sex determination systems have been discovered, particularly in plants.<ref name = "ainsworth2000"/> Dioecy is relatively uncommon in the plant kingdom, and a very low percentage of dioecious plant species have been determined to use the XY system. In most cases where the XY system is found it is believed to have evolved recently and independently.<ref name = "negrutiu2001">Negrutiu, I., B. Vyskot, N. Barbacar, S. Georgiev, and F.

''Plant Physiology'' '''127''' (4): 418-424.</ref>

Since the 1920s, a number of sex determination models have been proposed for ''Cannabis''. Ainsworth describes sex determination in the genus as using "an X/autosome dosage type".<ref name = "ainsworth2000"/>

The question of whether heteromorphic sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a [[karyotype]]. ''Cannabis'' was one of the first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards (see [[Cytogenetics#History|History of Cytogenetics]]). Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious "Kentucky" hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious "Kentucky" hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious "Kentucky" hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX.<ref name = "menzel1964">Menzel, Margaret Y. 1964. Meiotic chromosomes of monoecious Kentucky hemp (''Cannabis sativa'').

==Industrial and personal uses==
''Cannabis'' is used for a wide variety of purposes.

[[File:Cannabis Sativa Querschnitt.JPG|thumb|right|''Cannabis sativa'' stem longitudinal section]]
<!-----This is a summary only of the Main Article. Any further detail should be placed in the Main Article.----->
The term ''Hemp'' is used to name the durable soft fiber from the Cannabis [[Plant stem]] (stalk). ''Cannabis sativa'' cultivars are used for fibers due to their long stems; Sativa varieties may grow more than six metres tall. However, ''hemp'' can refer to any industrial or foodstuff product that is not intended for use as a drug. Many countries regulate limits for psychoactive compound ([[THC]]) concentrations in products labeled as hemp. 

Hemp is valuable in tens of thousands of commercial products, especially as fibre<ref name = "naihc.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/hemp_facts.html |title=Hemp Facts |publisher=Naihc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> ranging from [[paper]], [[Rope|cordage]], [[Hemp#Composite materials|construction material]] and textiles in general, to [[clothing]]. Hemp is stronger and longer-lasting than [[cotton]]. It also is a useful source of foodstuffs (help milk, hemp seed, hemp oil) and [[biofuels]]. Hemp has been used by many civilizations, from [[China]] to [[Europe]] (and later [[North America]]) during the last 12,000 years.<ref name = "naihc.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hempfood.com/IHA/iha02111.html |title=The cultivation and use of hemp in ancient China |publisher=Hempfood.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> In modern times novel applications and improvements have been explored with modest commercial success.<ref name="Gertjan">{{cite journal |

Cannabis is a popular recreational drug around the world, only behind [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[caffeine]] and [[tobacco]]. In the United States alone, it is believed that over 100 million Americans have tried Cannabis, with 25 million Americans having used it within the past year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5442 |title=Introduction |publisher=NORML |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref>

The psychoactive effects of Cannabis are known to have a biphasic nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, [[tetrahydrocannabinol]].

The plant ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' is known to cause more of a "high" by stimulating hunger and by producing a rather more comedic, or energetic feeling. Conversely, the ''Cannabis indica'' plant is known to cause more of a "stoned" or meditative feeling, possibly because of a higher CBD to THC ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.growery.org/3032/Indica-Sativa-Whats-the-difference |title=Indica?

In the United States, although the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does acknowledge that "there has been considerable interest in its use for the treatment of a number of conditions, including [[glaucoma]], AIDS wasting, neuropathic pain, treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, and chemotherapy-induced nausea," the agency has not approved "medical marijuana". There are currently 2 oral forms of cannabis (cannabinoids) available by prescription in the United States for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy: dronabinol (Marinol) and nabilone (Cesamet).

In a collection of writings on medical marijuana by 45 researchers, a literature review on the medicinal uses of ''Cannabis'' and cannabinoids concluded that established uses include easing of nausea and vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss; "well-confirmed effect" was found in the treatment of spasticity, painful conditions (i.e. neurogenic pain), movement disorders, asthma, and glaucoma. Reported but "less-confirmed" effects included treatment of allergies, inflammation, infection, epilepsy, depression, [[bipolar disorder]]s, [[anxiety disorder]], dependency and withdrawal.

Glaucoma, a condition of increased pressure within the eyeball causing gradual loss of sight, can be treated with medical marijuana to decrease this [[intraocular pressure]]. There has been debate for 25 years on the subject. Some studies have shown a reduction of IOP in glaucoma patients who smoke cannabis,<ref>{{cite journal|author = Merritt JC, Crawford WJ, Alexander PC, Anduze AL, Gelbart SS|title = Effect of marihuana on intraocular and blood pressure in glaucoma|journal = Ophthalmology|volume = 87|issue = 3|pages = 222–8|year = 1980|month = March|pmid = 7053160|doi = |url = }}</ref> but the effects are generally short-lived. There exists some concern over its use since it can also decrease blood flow to the optic nerve. Marijuana lowers IOP by acting on a [[cannabinoid receptor]] on the [[ciliary body]] called the CB receptor.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Goldberg J, Flowerdew G, Smith E, Brody JA, Tso MO|title = Factors associated with age-related macular degeneration.

Another potential use for medical cannabis is movement disorders. ''Cannabis'' is frequently reported to reduce the muscle spasms associated with [[multiple sclerosis]]; this has been acknowledged by the [[Institute of Medicine]], but it noted that these abundant anecdotal reports are not well-supported by clinical data. Evidence from animal studies suggests that there is a possible role for cannabinoids in the treatment of certain types of epileptic seizures.<ref>{{cite book|author = Randall, Blanchard|title = Medical use of marijuana policy and regulatory issues|publisher = Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress|year = 1992|id = OCLC 29975643}}</ref> A synthetic version of the major active compound in ''Cannabis'', THC, is available in capsule form as the prescription drug [[dronabinol]] (Marinol) in many countries.

Cannabis was manufactured and sold by U.S. pharmaceutical companies from the 1880s through the 1930s, but the lack of documented information on the frequency and effectiveness of its use makes it difficult to evaluate its medicinal value in these forms. Cannabis was listed in the ''1929–1930 Physicians' Catalog of the Pharmaceutical and Biological Products of Parke, Davis & Company'' as an active ingredient in ten products for cough, colic, neuralgia, cholera mordus and other medical conditions, as well as a "narcotic, analgesic, and sedative."<ref>''1929–1930 Physicians' Catalog of the Pharmaceutical and Biological Products of Parke, Davis & Company''.

Detroit: Parke, Davis & Co., p. 194.</ref>

As cannabis is further legalized for medicinal use, it is possible that some of the foregoing compound medicines, whose formulas have been copied exactly as published, may be scientifically tested to determine whether they are effective medications. Writing in the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]], smoking cannabis from a pipe may significantly relieve chronic pain in patients with damaged nerves.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cannabis may relieve chronic nerve pain|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11110798 |publisher=BBC|date=30 August 2010|accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> A study on New Zealand support the claim that that long-term cannabis smoking increases the risk of lung cancer in young adults.<ref>[http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/31/2/280.full S.

The Yanghai Tombs, a vast ancient cemetery (54 000 m<sup>2</sup>) situated in the [[Turfan]] district of the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], have revealed the 2700-year-old grave of a [[shaman]]. He is thought to have belonged to the [[Jushi culture]] recorded in the area centuries later in the ''[[Hanshu]]'', Chap 96B.<ref>Hulsewé (1979), p. 183.</ref> Near the head and foot of the shaman was a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled with 789g of cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], the psychoactive component of cannabis. The cannabis was presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactive agent, or an aid to divination. This is the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologically active agent.<ref name="Russo">{{cite journal|title=Phytochemical and genetic analyses of ancient cannabis from Central Asia|url= http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/59/15/4171 |first= Ethan B|last= Russo|publisher=Journal of Experimental Botany, Vol. 59, No. 15|pages= 4171–4182|year=2008|accessdate=2011=0305}}</ref>

''Cannabis'' is first referred to in [[Hindu]] [[Vedas]] between 2000 and 1400 BCE, in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]''. By the 10th century CE, it has been suggested that it was referred to by some in India as "food of the gods".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/history/first12000/1.htm|title = Marijuana - The First Twelve Thousand Years|first = Ernest L.|last = Abel|year = 1980}} Chapter 1: Cannabis in the Ancient World.

In the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Cannabis or Sukha ( ਸੁੱਖਾ ਪ੍ਰਰਸਾਦ ), "peace-giver", is the term [[Sikhs]] use to refer to it.
Initiated by the tenth guru of the Sikhs, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], cannabis or bhang (ਭੰਗ) was used to help in meditation and was also used before battles to aid as a painkiller, growing naturally all over Punjab. Narrated by many historical and native accounts cannabis is pounded by the Sikhs, especially during religious festivals like [[Hola Mohalla]].[43]
Even today, [[Nihang]] Sikhs gather in their thousands at [[Anandapur, Bangladesh|Anandpur]], on the occasion of the festival of Hola Mohalla and display their martial skills and of course cannabis is pounded by the Nihang Sikhs. This tradition has been in place since the time of Guru Gobind Singh. Their fighting style is referred to as shastar vidiya, which is among the most intimidating and brutal martial art. The compositions from the Sri Dasam Granth are used in unison with the battle maneuvers.
