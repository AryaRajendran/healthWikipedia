'''Bovine spongiform encephalopathy''' ('''BSE'''), commonly known as '''mad cow disease''', is a fatal [[neurodegenerative disease]] ([[encephalopathy]]) in [[cattle]] that causes a spongy degeneration in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. BSE has a long [[incubation period]], about 30 months to 8 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years, all [[breed]]s being equally susceptible.<ref name="FSRIO">

A British and Irish inquiry into BSE concluded the [[epizootic]] was caused by cattle, which are normally [[herbivore]]s, being fed the remains of other cattle in the form of [[meat and bone meal]] (MBM), which caused the infectious agent to spread.<ref name="DEFRA/BSE">{{ cite web | url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/controls-eradication/causes.html | title=BSE: Disease control & eradication – Causes of BSE | publisher=Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs | date=March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/ | title=The BSE Inquiry}}</ref> The cause of BSE may be from the contamination of MBM from sheep with [[scrapie]] that were processed in the same slaughterhouse.

Another case reported later in May 2003.

In June 2005, [[Dr. John Clifford]], chief veterinary officer for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] animal health inspection service, confirmed a fully domestic case of BSE in [[Texas]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/national/30cow.html reported "Case of Mad Cow in Texas Is First to Originate in U.S."], ''New York Times''</ref>

A new case of BSE disease was recently found in a dairy cow on 23 April 2012 in [[California]] during a planned Agriculture Department surveillance program.

On 8 December 2012, the Japanese government issued a ban on imports of raw beef from Brazil, based on reports that a cow which died in 2010 in southern Brazil carried disease-carrying proteins.<ref>[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/2r9852000002qozq.html reported "An Outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in Brazil"], ''Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare''</ref> The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture maintains that its beef is free of BSE.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/12/11/3960074/brazil-says-its-beef-is-mad-cow.html reported "Brazil says its beef is free of mad cow disease"], ''Kansas City Star''</ref> The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture informed that the animal in question didn't manifest the disease and didn't die of this cause.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/07/us-brazil-madcow-idUSBRE8B60GH20121207 reported "Brazil government denies reports of 2010 mad cow case"], ''Reuters''</ref>

== Cause ==
The infectious agent in BSE is believed to be a specific type of [[protein folding|misfolded]] [[protein]] called a [[prion]]. Prions are not destroyed even if the beef or material containing them is cooked or heat-treated. Prion proteins carry the disease between individuals and cause deterioration of the [[brain]]. BSE is a type of [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]] (TSE).<ref name="TSE">{{cite web

}}</ref> TSEs can arise in animals that carry an [[allele]] which causes previously normal protein molecules to contort by themselves from an [[alpha helical]] arrangement to a [[beta pleated sheet]], which is the disease-causing [[Conformational isomerism|shape]] for the particular protein. Transmission can occur when healthy animals come in contact with tainted tissues from others with the disease. In the brain, these proteins cause native cellular prion protein to deform into the infectious state, which then goes on to deform further prion protein in an exponential cascade. This results in protein aggregates, which then form dense [[senile plaques|plaque]] fibers, leading to the microscopic appearance of "holes" in the brain, degeneration of physical and mental abilities, and ultimately death.

Different hypotheses exist for the origin of prion proteins in cattle.  Two leading hypotheses suggest it may have jumped species from the disease [[scrapie]] in sheep, or that it evolved from a spontaneous form of "mad cow disease" that has been seen occasionally in cattle for many centuries.<ref>{{cite journal

Research in 2008 suggested that mad cow disease also is caused by a genetic mutation within a gene called the prion protein gene. The research showed, for the first time, that a 10-year-old cow from [[Alabama]] with an atypical form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy had the same type of prion protein gene mutation as found in human patients with the genetic form of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]](genetic CJD). This form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is called variant CJD.<ref>{{cite journal

== Epidemic in British cattle ==
Cattle are naturally [[herbivore]]s, eating [[grass]]. However in modern industrial cattle-farming, various commercial feeds are used, which may contain ingredients including [[antibiotic]]s, [[hormone]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, and [[protein]] supplements. The use of meat and bone meal, produced from the ground and cooked leftovers of the slaughtering process, as well as from the carcasses of sick and injured animals such as cattle or sheep<!-- rendered chicken parts are called poultry meal-->, as a protein supplement in cattle feed was widespread in [[Europe]] prior to about 1987.<ref name="FDA/CFSAN"/> Worldwide, [[soybean]] meal is the primary plant-based protein supplement fed to cattle. However, soybeans do not grow well in Europe, so cattle raisers throughout Europe turned to the cheaper animal byproduct feeds as an alternative. The British Inquiry dismissed suggestions that changes to processing might have increased the  infectious agents in cattle feed, saying "changes in process could not have been solely responsible for the emergence of BSE, and changes in regulation were not a factor at all."<ref>[http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/report/volume2/chaptea3.htm#820576 www.bseinquiry.gov.uk: The nature and cause of BSE]</ref> (The prion causing BSE is not destroyed by heat treatment.)

The first confirmed animal to fall ill with the disease occurred in 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and lab tests the following year indicated the presence of BSE; by November 1987, the British Ministry of Agriculture accepted it had a new disease on its hands.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn111-brain-disease-drives-cows-wild.html Brain disease drives cows wild]</ref> Subsequently, 165 people (until October 2009) contracted and died of a disease with similar neurological symptoms subsequently called (new) [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (vCJD).<ref name="NCJDSU"/> This is a separate disease from 'classical' [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], which is not related to BSE and has been known about since the early 1900s. Three cases of vCJD occurred in people who had lived in or visited the UK – one each in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]]. There is also some concern about those who work with (and therefore inhale) cattle [[meat and bone meal]], such as [[horticulture|horticulturists]], who use it as fertilizer. Up-to-date statistics on all types of CJD are published by the National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].

For many of the vCJD patients, direct evidence exists that they had consumed tainted [[beef]], and this is assumed to be the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it. Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of [[nervous system]] tissue with [[hamburger]] and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by culling all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which are typically measured in years or decades. As a result, the full extent of the human vCJD outbreak is still not known.

The scientific consensus is that infectious BSE prion material is not destroyed through normal cooking procedures, meaning that even contaminated beef foodstuffs prepared "well done" may remain infectious.<ref>{{cite news

Alan Colchester, a professor of neurology at the [[University of Kent]], and Nancy Colchester, writing in the 3 September 2005 issue of the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', proposed a theory that the most likely initial origin of BSE in the [[United Kingdom]] was the importation from the Indian Subcontinent of bone meal which contained CJD-infected human remains.<ref>{{cite journal

===Epizootic in the United Kingdom===
During the course of the investigation into the BSE epizootic, an enquiry was also made into the activities of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and its Medicines Control Agency. On 7 May 1999, in his written statement to the BSE Inquiry,<ref name="haggerpdf" /> [[David Osborne Hagger]] reported on behalf of the Medicines Control Agency that in a previous enquiry the Agency had been asked to:
<blockquote>"... identify relevant manufacturers and obtain information about the bovine material contained in children’s vaccines, the stocks of these vaccines and how long it would take to switch to other products." It was further reported that the: "... use of bovine insulin in a small group of mainly elderly patients was noted and it was recognised that alternative products for this group were not considered satisfactory." A medicines licensing committee report that same year recommended: "... no licensing action is required at present in regard to products produced from bovine material or using prepared bovine brain in nutrient media and sourced from outside the [[United Kingdom]], the Channel Isles and the Republic of Ireland provided that the country of origin is known to be free of BSE, has competent veterinary advisers and is known to practise good animal husbandry." In 1990, the British Diabetic Association became concerned regarding the safety of bovine insulin and the government licensing agency assured them: "... there was no insulin sourced from cattle in the Britain or Ireland and that the situation in other countries was being monitored." In 1991, a European Community Commission "... expressed concerns about the possible transmission of the BSE/scrapie agent to man through use of certain cosmetic treatments." Sources in France reported to the British Medicines Control Agency: "... that there were some licensed surgical sutures derived from French bovine material." Concerns were also raised "... regarding a possible risk of transmission of the BSE agent in gelatin products."<ref name="haggerpdf">{{cite web|url=http://tna.europarchive.org/20080102164404/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/files/ws/s476.pdf|title=BSE Inquiry, Statement No. 476|date=7 May 1999|publisher=BSE Inquiry|accessdate=2008-10-16}} Statement of David Osborne Hagger, Head of Abridged Licensing and Coordinator of the Executive support business of the Medicines Division of the [[British Department of Health|Department of Health]] at Market Towers in London.</ref></blockquote>

===The ban on British beef===

The BSE crisis led to the [[European Union]] banning exports of British beef with effect from March 1996; the ban would last for 10 years before it was finally lifted on 1 May 2006<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4967480.stm |work=BBC News | title=End to 10-year British beef ban | date=3 May 2006}}</ref> despite attempts in May 1996 by British prime minister [[John Major]] to get the ban lifted; [[Russia]] is currently proceeding to lift the ban sometime after November 2012 after 16 years; the announcement was made during the UK's chief veterinary officer [[Nigel Gibbens]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20454206| title=Russia to lift 16-year ban on British beef and lamb| date=22 November 2012}}</ref>

It was successfully negotiated that beef from Wales was allowed to be exported to the Dutch market, which had formerly been an important market for Northern Irish beef. Of two approved export establishments in the United Kingdom in 1999, one was in Scotland – an establishment to which live beef was supplied from Northern Ireland. As the incidence of BSE was very low in Northern Ireland (partly due to the early adoption of an advanced herd tagging and computerization system in the region) – only six cases of BSE by 1999 – calls were made to remove the EU ban on exports with regard to Northern Irish beef.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmniaf/62/6205.htm UK Parliament website] Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs Second Report</ref>

[[File:Global mad cow cases map.PNG|thumb|left|400px|Dark green areas are countries with confirmed human cases of vCJD; light green shows countries which have reported cases of only BSE.]]

The table to the right summarizes reported cases of BSE and of vCJD by country. (The vCJD column is by county of residence of patient at time of diagnosis and not suspected origin of beef.) BSE is the disease in cattle, while vCJD is the disease in people.

The tests used for detecting BSE vary considerably, as do the regulations in various jurisdictions for when, and which cattle, must be tested. For instance in the EU, the cattle tested are older (30 months or older), while many cattle are slaughtered younger than that. At the opposite end of the scale, Japan tests all cattle at the time of slaughter. Tests are also difficult, as the altered prion protein has very low levels in blood or urine, and no other signal has been found. Newer tests are faster, more sensitive, and cheaper, so future figures possibly may be more comprehensive. Even so, currently the only reliable test is examination of tissues during a [[necropsy]].

It is notable{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} that there are no cases reported in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[New Zealand]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Vanuatu]], where cattle are mainly fed outside on grass pasture and, mostly in Australia, grain feeding is done only as a final finishing process before the animals are slaughtered for meat.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

As for vCJD in humans, autopsy tests are not always done, so those figures, too, are likely to be too low, but probably by a lesser fraction. In the United Kingdom, anyone with possible vCJD symptoms must be reported to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has refused to impose a national requirement that physicians and hospitals report cases of the disease. Instead, the agency relies on other methods, including death certificates and urging physicians to send suspicious cases to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, which is funded by the CDC.

== Practices in the United States relating to BSE ==
Soybean meal is cheap and plentiful in the [[United States]]. The 1.5 million tons of cottonseed meal produced in the U.S. every year that is not suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animal is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so there was not much incentive to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibit the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to [[ruminant]]s such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and poultry, such as chickens. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals.<ref>{{cite book

</ref>  Compliance with the regulations was shown to be extremely poor before the discovery of the Washington cow, but industry representatives report that compliance is now total. Even so, critics call the partial prohibitions insufficient.

===Effect on the US beef industry===
Japan was the top importer of US beef, buying 240,000 tons valued at $1.4 billion in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} After the discovery of the first case of BSE in the US on 23 December 2003, Japan halted US beef imports. In December 2005, Japan once again allowed imports of US. beef, but reinstated its ban in January 2006 after a violation of the US-Japan beef import agreement: a vertebral column, which should have been removed prior to shipment, was included in a shipment of veal.

Tokyo yielded to US pressure to resume imports, ignoring consumer worries about the safety of US beef, said Japanese consumer groups. Michiko Kamiyama from Food Safety Citizen Watch and Yoko Tomiyama from [[Consumers Union of Japan]]<ref>http://www.fswatch.org/newsletter/english/issue05.html</ref> said about this: "The government has put priority on the political schedule between the two countries, not on food safety or human health."

Sixty-five nations implemented full or partial restrictions on importing U.S. beef products because of concerns that US testing lacked sufficient rigor. As a result, exports of US beef declined from 1,300,000 metric tons in 2003, (before the first mad cow was detected in the US) to 322,000 metric tons in 2004. This has increased since then to 771,000 metric tons in 2007.<ref name="usmef">{{cite web

On 31 December 2006, Hematech, Inc, a biotechnology company based in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]], [[South Dakota]], announced it had used genetic engineering and cloning technology to produce cattle that lacked a necessary gene for prion production – thus theoretically making them immune to BSE.<ref>

==Clinical signs in cattle==
Cows affected by BSE are usually apart from the herd and will show progressively deteriorating behavioural and neurological signs. One notable sign is an increase in aggression. Cattle will react excessively to noise or touch and will slowly become [[ataxia|ataxic]].<ref name="WikiVet">[http://en.wikivet.net/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy] reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.</ref>

Systemic signs of disease, such as a drop in milk production, [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and lethargy, are present.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of BSE continues to be a practical problem. It has an incubation period of months to years, during which there are no symptoms, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form has started. At present, there is virtually no way to detect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> reliably except by examining ''post mortem'' brain tissue using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.

The traditional method of diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the brain, and other tissues, ''[[post mortem]]''. [[Immunohistochemistry]] can be used to demonstrate prion protein accumulation.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in a hundred thousand million (10<sup>−11</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)]] and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrPSc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood or urine-based screening test for BSE.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today. |pages=195 |year=2010 |month=August |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf | title = SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in Brain and Blood | publisher = SUNY Downstate Medical Center | authorlink = Rubenstein, R., et al. | accessdate = 2011-08-19}}</ref>

==Control==
A ban on feeding cattle meat and bone meal has resulted in a reduction in cases in countries where the disease was present. In disease-free countries, control relies on import control, feeding regulations and surveillance measures.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

At the [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] in the UK, the brain, spinal cord, trigeminal ganglia, intestines, eyes and tonsils from cattle are classified as [[specified risk material]]s, and must be disposed of appropriately.<ref name="WikiVet"/>
