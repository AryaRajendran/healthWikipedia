A '''solid pseudo[[:wikt:papilla|papillary]] [[tumour]]''' (also known as '''solid pseudopapillary neoplasm''' or, more formally, '''solid pseudopapillary tumour/neoplasm of the pancreas''') is a low-grade malignant [[neoplasm]] of the [[pancreas]] that typically afflicts young women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patil TB, Shrikhande SV, Kanhere HA, Saoji RR, Ramadwar MR, Shukla PJ |title=Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: a single institution experience of 14 cases |journal=HPB:the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=148-50 |year=2006 |pmid=18333264 |doi=10.1080/13651820510035721 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2131425/}}</ref>

==Gross morphology==
Solid pseudopapillary tumours are typically round, well-demarcated, measuring 2–17&nbsp;cm in diameter (average 8&nbsp;cm), with solid and cystic areas with [[hemorrhage]] on cut sections.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fletcher CDM |title=Diagnostic Histopathology of Tumors |publisher=Elsevier |year=2007 |page=478 |edition=3rd |volume=I}}</ref>

==Histomorphology==
Solid pseudopapillary tumours consist of solid sheets of cells that are focally dyscohesive.  The cells in the lesion usually have uniform [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] with occasional nuclear grooves, eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and [[Periodic acid-Schiff stain|PAS]] positive eosinophilic intracytoplasmic globules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Serra S, Chetty R |title=Revision 2: an immunohistochemical approach and evaluation of solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=1153–9 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18708424 |doi=10.1136/jcp.2008.057828 |url=http://jcp.bmj.com/content/61/11/1153}}</ref> Necrosis is usually present and, as cell death preferentially occurs distant from blood vessels, lead to the formation of pseudopapillae.

==Immunohistochemistry==
Solid pseudopapillary tumours show positive nuclear staining for beta catenin, as well as positive immunostaining for [[CD10]], [[CD56]], [[vimentin]], [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]], and [[neuron specific enolase]]; they are negative for [[chromogranin]] and pancreatic enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stömmer P, Kraus J, Stolte M, Giedl J |title=Solid and cystic pancreatic tumors.
