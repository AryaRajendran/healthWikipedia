[[File:Dscp Iab.JPG|thumb|right|An intra-aortic balloon pump]] 
The '''Intra-aortic balloon pump''' '''(IABP)''' is a mechanical device that increases [[myocardium|myocardial]] [[oxygen]] perfusion while at the same time increasing [[cardiac output]]. Increasing cardiac output increases coronary [[blood]] flow and therefore myocardial oxygen delivery. It consists of a cylindrical polyethylene balloon that sits in the [[aorta]], approximately {{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us}} from the left [[subclavian artery]]<ref name="THI">

That is, it actively deflates in [[Systole (medicine)|systole]], increasing forward blood flow by reducing [[afterload]] through a vacuum effect. It actively inflates in [[diastole]], increasing blood flow to the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] via retrograde flow. These actions combine to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and increase myocardial oxygen supply.<ref name="IrwinRippe">

A computer-controlled mechanism inflates the balloon with [[helium]] from a cylinder during diastole, usually linked to either an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) or a pressure [[transducer]] at the [[distal]] tip of the [[catheter]]; some IABPs, such as the Datascope System 98XT, allow asynchronous counterpulsation at a set rate, though this setting is rarely used. Helium is used because its low viscosity allows it to travel quickly through the long connecting tubes, and has a lower risk than air of causing an [[embolism]] should the balloon rupture.

==History==
The IABP device was pioneered at [[Sinai-Grace Hospital|Grace Sinai Hospital]] in Detroit during the early 1960s by 
Dr. [[Adrian Kantrowitz]] and his team.<ref name="IJTCS"/> The device was developed for use in [[heart surgery]] by Dr. David Bregman in 1976 at [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[New York City]].<ref>
"NewYork-Presbyterian Heart 'Firsts'", available at [http://www.nyp.org/about/heart-firsts.html http://www.nyp.org/about/heart-firsts.html]</ref>

The first clinical implant was performed at [[Maimonides Medical Center]], Brooklyn, N.Y. in Oct., 1967. The patient, a 48  year old woman, was in cardiogenic shock and unresponsive to traditional therapy. An IABP was inserted by a cut down on the left [[femoral artery]]. Pumping was performed for approximately 6 hours. Shock reversed and the patient was discharged.

The size of the original balloon was 15 [[French catheter scale|French]] but eventually 9 and 8 [[French catheter scale|French]] balloons were developed.<ref name="Overwalder">

==Indications==
The following situations may benefit from this device.<ref name="IrwinRippe"/><ref name="IJTCS"/><ref name="HongKong"/>
*[[Cardiogenic shock]] when used alone as treatment for [[myocardial infarction]]. 9-22% survive the first year.
*Reversible [[heart|intracardial]] mechanical defects complicating infarction, i.e. acute [[mitral valve|mitral]] regurgitation and [[septal]] perforation.
*Unstable [[angina pectoris]] benefits from counterpulsation.
*Post [[cardiothoracic surgery]]&mdash;most common and useful is counterpulsation in weaning patients from [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] after continued perioperative injury to myocardial tissue.
*Preoperative use is suggested for high-risk patients such as those with unstable [[angina]] with [[stenosis]] greater than 70% of main coronary artery, in [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] dysfunction with an [[ejection fraction]] less than 35%.
*[[PTCA|Percutaneous coronary angioplasty]]
*In high risk [[coronary artery bypass]] graft surgery where cardiopulmonary bypass time was shortened, as well as during intubation period and hospital stay.<ref name="Shankar">

==Contraindications==
[[File:Ballondruckkurve.JPG|thumb|Aortic pressure curve in the presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump]]

===Absolute contraindication===
The following conditions will always exclude patients for treatment:<ref name="IrwinRippe"/>
<ref name="IJTCS"/>
<ref name="HongKong"/>
*Severe [[aortic valve]] insufficiency
*[[Aortic dissection]]
*Severe [[aortoiliac occlusive disease]]

===Relative contraindication===
The following conditions make IABP therapy inadvisable except under pressing circumstances:<ref name="IrwinRippe"/>
*[[Prosthetic]] [[vascular]] grafts in the [[aorta]]
*Aortic [[aneurysm]]
*Aortofemoral grafts

==Complications==
Since the device is placed in the [[femoral artery]] and aorta it could provoke [[ischemia]], and [[compartment syndrome]]. The leg is at highest risk of becoming ischemic if the femoral artery it is supplied by becomes obstructed. Placing the balloon too [[distal]] from the [[aortic arch|arcus aortae]] may induce occlusion of the [[renal artery]] and subsequent [[renal failure]]. Other possible complications are [[cerebral embolism]] during insertion, infection, [[dissection]] of the aorta or [[iliac artery]], perforation of the artery and [[hemorrhage]] in the [[mediastinum]]. Mechanical failure of the balloon itself is also a risk which entails vascular surgery to remove under that circumstance. After balloon removal there is also a risk of 'embolic shower' from micro clots that have formed on the surface of the balloon, and can lead to peripheral thrombosis, [[myocardial ischemia]], hemodynamic decompensation, and late [[pseudoaneurysm]].<ref name="IrwinRippe"/>
