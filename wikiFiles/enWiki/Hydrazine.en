'''Hydrazine''' (also called '''diazane''') is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. It is a colourless flammable liquid with an [[ammonia]]-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution.  {{asof|2002}}, approximately 260,000 tons were manufactured annually.<ref name=Ullmann>Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq "Hydrazine" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_177}}.</ref> Hydrazine is mainly used as a [[foaming agent]] in preparing [[polymer]] [[foam]]s, but significant applications also include its uses as a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to [[polymerization]] catalysts and [[pharmaceutical]]s. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various [[rocket fuels]] and to prepare the gas precursors used in [[air bags]].  Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical [[power plant]] steam cycles to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion.

==Molecular structure and properties==
Hydrazine forms a monohydrate that is more dense (1.032 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) than the anhydrous material.

Hydrazine can arise via coupling a pair of [[ammonia]] molecules by removal of one hydrogen per molecule.  Each H<sub>2</sub>N-N subunit is pyramidal in shape.  The N-N distance is 1.45 Å (145 [[picometer|pm]]), and the molecule adopts a [[Gauche effect|gauche conformation]].<ref>Miessler, Gary L. and Tarr, Donald A. '' Inorganic Chemistry, Third Edition'' Pearson Prentice Hall (2004) ISBN 0-13-035471-6.</ref> The [[rotational barrier]] is twice that of [[ethane]].  These structural properties resemble those of gaseous [[hydrogen peroxide]], which adopts a "skewed" [[Linear alkane conformation|anticlinal]] conformation, and also experiences a strong rotational barrier.

Hydrazine has [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] ([[alkali]]) chemical properties comparable to those of [[ammonia]]:
:N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O →  [N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>−</sup>
with the values:<ref>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics", 83rd edition, CRC Press, 2002</ref>    
: ''K<sub>b</sub>'' = 1.3 x 10<sup>−6</sup>
: ''pK<sub>a</sub>'' = 8.1
(for ammonia ''K<sub>b</sub>'' = 1.78 x 10<sup>−5</sup>)

Hydrazine is difficult to diprotonate:<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.</ref>
:[N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]<sup>+</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O →  [N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> + OH<sup>−</sup>    ''K''<sub>b</sub> = 8.4 x 10<sup>−16</sup>

The heat of combustion of hydrazine in oxygen (air) is 194.1 x 10<sup>5</sup> J/kg (9345 BTU/lb).<ref>[http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chris/HDZ.pdf Chemical Hazard Properties Table at NOAA.gov]</ref>

==Synthesis and manufacture==
[[Theodor Curtius]] synthesized free hydrazine for the first time in 1889 via a circuitous route.<ref>Curtius, ''J. Prakt. Chem''. '''1889''', 39, 107-39.</ref>

Hydrazine is produced in the [[Olin Raschig process]] from [[sodium hypochlorite]] (the active ingredient in many [[bleach]]es) and [[ammonia]], a process announced in 1907.  This method relies on the reaction of [[chloramine]] with ammonia:<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Adams, R.; Brown, B. K. | title = Hydrazine Sulfate | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 309 | year = 1941 | prep = cv1p0309}}</ref> 
:NH<sub>2</sub>Cl  +  NH<sub>3</sub>   →   H<sub>2</sub>N-NH<sub>2</sub>  +  HCl
Another route of hydrazine synthesis involves oxidation of [[urea]] with [[sodium hypochlorite]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemindustry.ru/Hydrazine.php|title=Hydrazine: Chemical product info|publisher=chemindustry.ru|accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref>

:(H<sub>2</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>C=O + NaOCl + 2 NaOH → N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>

Hydrazine can be synthesized from [[ammonia]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] in the [[Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann process]], according to the following formula:

:2NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>N-NH<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O <ref>Chemistry of Petrochemical Processes, 2nd edition, Gulf Publishing Company, 1994-2000, Page 148</ref>

In the [[Atofina–PCUK cycle]], hydrazine is produced in several steps from [[acetone]], ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide.  Acetone and ammonia first react to give the [[imine]] followed by oxidation with [[hydrogen peroxide]] to the [[oxaziridine]], a three-membered ring containing carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, followed by [[ammonolysis]] to the [[hydrazone]], a process that couples two nitrogen atoms. This hydrazone reacts with one more equivalent of acetone, and the resulting [[acetone azine]] is hydrolyzed to give hydrazine, regenerating acetone. Unlike the Raschig process, this process does not produce salt.  The PCUK stands for [[Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann]], a French chemical manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Riegel | first = Emil Raymond | contribution = Hydrazine | title = Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry | page = 192 | year = 1992 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}.</ref>

Hydrazine can also be produced via the so-called [[ketazine process|ketazine]] and [[peroxide process]]es.

==Applications==
The majority use of hydrazine is as a precursor to [[blowing agent]]s. Specific compounds include [[azodicarbonamide]] and [[azobisisobutyronitrile]], which yield 100-200 mL of gas per gram of precursor.  In a  related application, [[sodium azide]], the gas-forming agent in [[air bags]], is produced from hydrazine by reaction with [[sodium nitrite]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

Hydrazine is also used as a propellant on board space vehicles, and to both reduce the concentration of dissolved oxygen in and control pH of water used in large industrial boilers.  The [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighter jet uses hydrazine to fuel the aircraft's emergency power unit.

===Precursor to pesticides and pharmaceuticals===
Hydrazine is a useful building block in [[organic synthesis]] of pharmaceuticals and pesticides.  One example is [[3-amino-1,2,4-triazole]] and another is maleic hydrazide.  The antitubercular drug [[isoniazid]] is prepared from hydrazine.

==Hydrazine in biology==
Hydrazine is the intermediate in the anaerobic oxidation of ammonia (anammox) process.<ref>Strous, M., and Jetten, M.S.M. (2004) Anaerobic oxidation of methane and ammonium. Ann Rev Microbiol 58: 99–117.</ref>  It is produced by some yeasts and the open ocean bacterium anammox (''[[Brocadia anammoxidans]]'').<ref>{{cite news | author = Brian Handwerk | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1109_051109_rocketfuel.html | title = Bacteria Eat Human Sewage, Produce Rocket Fuel | publisher = [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |date=9 November 2005 | accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref>
The [[false morel]] produces the poison [[gyromitrin]] which is an organic derivative of hydrazine that is converted to [[monomethylhydrazine]] by metabolic processes. Even the most popular edible "button" mushroom [[Agaricus bisporus]] produces organic hydrazine derivatives, including [[agaritine]], a hydrazine derivative of an amino acid, and [[gyromitrin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hashida C, Hayashi K, Jie L, Haga S, Sakurai M, Shimizu H |title=[Quantities of agaritine in mushrooms (''Agaricus bisporus'') and the carcinogenicity of mushroom methanol extracts on the mouse bladder epithelium] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Koshu Eisei Zasshi |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=400–5 |year=1990 |month=June |pmid=2132000 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Sieger AA (ed.) |url=http://www.psms.org/sporeprints/sp338.html |title=Spore Prints #338 |work=Bulletin of the Puget Sound Mycological Society | date=1998-01-01 |accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref>

==Organic chemistry==
Hydrazines are part of many [[organic syntheses]], often those of practical significance in [[pharmaceutical]]s, such as the antituberculosis medication [[isoniazid]] and the antifungal [[fluconazole]], as well as in textile [[dye]]s and in photography.<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Hydrazone formation===
Illustrative of the condensation of hydrazine with a simple carbonyl is its reaction with propanone to give the diisopropylidene hydrazine (acetone azine).  The latter reacts further with hydrazine to yield the hydrazone:<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Day,  A. C.; Whiting,  M. C. | title = Acetone Hydrazone | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 10 | prep = cv6p0010}}</ref>
:2 (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO  +  N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>  →  2 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=N]<sub>2</sub>
:[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=N]<sub>2</sub>  +  N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>  →  2 (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=NNH<sub>2</sub>
The propanone azine is an intermediate in the Atofina-PCUK synthesis.  Direct [[alkylation]] of hydrazines with [[alkyl halides]] in the presence of base yields alkyl-substituted hydrazines, but the reaction is typically inefficient due to poor control on level of substitution (same as in ordinary [[amine]]s).  The reduction of [[hydrazone]]s to hydrazines present a  clean way to produce 1,1-dialkylated hydrazines.

In a related reaction, 2-cyano[[pyridine]]s react with hydrazine to form amide hydrazides, which can be converted using 1,2-diketones into [[triazines]].

===Wolff-Kishner reduction===
Hydrazine is used in the [[Wolff-Kishner reduction]], a reaction that transforms the [[carbonyl]] group of a [[ketone]] into a [[methylene bridge]] (or an [[aldehyde]] into a [[methyl group]]) via a [[hydrazone]] intermediate.  The production of the highly stable [[dinitrogen]] from the hydrazine derivative helps to drive the reaction.

===Heterocyclic chemistry===
Being bifunctional, with two amines, hydrazine is a key building block for the preparation of many heterocyclic compounds via condensation with a range of difunctional [[electrophiles]].  With [[2,4-pentanedione]], it condenses to give the [[3,5-dimethylpyrazole]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Wiley, R. H.; Hexner, P. E. | title = 3,5-Dimethylpyrazole | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 351 | prep = cv4p0351}}</ref>  In the [[Einhorn-Brunner reaction]] hydrazines react with imides to give [[triazole]]s.

===Sulfonation===
Being a good nucleophile, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> can attack sulfonyl halides and acyl halides.<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Friedman, L; Litle, R. L.; Reichle, W. R. | title = ''p''-Toluenesulfonyl Hydrazide | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 1055 | prep = cv5p1055}}</ref> The [[tosyl]]hydrazine also forms hydrazones upon treatment with carbonyls.

===Deprotection of phthalimides===
Hydrazine is used to cleave ''N''-alkylated phthalimide derivatives.  This scission reaction allows phthalimide anion to be used as amine precursor in the [[Gabriel synthesis]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Weinshenker, N. M.; Shen, C. M.; Wong, J. Y. | title = Polymeric carbodiimide | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 951 | year = 1988 | prep = cv6p0951}}</ref>

===Reducing agent===
Hydrazine is a convenient reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water.  Thus, it is used as an [[antioxidant]], an oxygen [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenger]], and a [[corrosion inhibitor]] in water boilers and heating systems.  It is also used to reduce metal salts and oxides to the pure metals in [[electroless nickel plating|electroless]] [[nickel]] plating and [[plutonium]] extraction from [[nuclear waste|nuclear reactor waste]].  Some colour photographic processes also use a weak solution of hydrazine as a stabilizing wash, as it scavenges [[dye coupler]] and unreacted silver halides. Hydrazine is the most common and effective reducing agent used to convert graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via hydrothermal treatment.<ref>Stankovich et al., Synthesis of graphene-based nanosheets via chemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide, Carbon, 45, (2007) 1558–1565</ref>

===Hydrazinium salts===
Hydrazine is converted to solid salts by treatment with mineral acids.  A common salt is [[hydrazine sulfate]], [N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]HSO<sub>4</sub>, called hydrazinium sulfate.<ref>[http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/h3633.htm Safety Data Sheet Mallinckrodt]</ref> Hydrazine sulfate was investigated as a treatment of cancer-induced [[cachexia]], but proved ineffective.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00003495-199855050-00005 |author=Gagnon B, Bruera E |title=A review of the drug treatment of cachexia associated with cancer |journal=Drugs |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=675–88 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9585863}}</ref>

Hydrazine azide (N<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), the salt of hydrazine and [[hydrazoic acid]], was of scientific interest, because of its high nitrogen content and explosive properties. Structurally, it is {{chem|[N|2|H|5|]|+|[N|3|]|-}}. It decomposes explosively into hydrazine, ammonia and nitrogen gas:<ref>{{cite book

==Other industrial uses==
Hydrazine is used in many processes including: production of [[spandex]] fibers, as a [[polymerization]] [[catalyst]]; in [[fuel cell]]s, [[solder]] [[flux (metallurgy)|fluxes]]; and [[photographic developer]]s, as a [[chain extender]] in [[polyurethane|urethane]] polymerizations, and heat stabilizers.  In addition, a semiconductor deposition technique using hydrazine has recently been demonstrated, with possible application to the manufacture of [[thin-film transistor]]s used in [[liquid crystal display]]s. Hydrazine in a 70% hydrazine, 30% water solution is used to power the EPU ([[emergency power unit]]) on the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] fighter plane.  The explosive [[Astrolite]] is made by combining hydrazine with [[ammonium nitrate]].

Hydrazine is often used as an oxygen scavenger and [[corrosion inhibitor]] in boiler water treatment. However due to the toxicity and certain undesired effects{{clarify|date=July 2012}} this practice is discouraged.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Rocket fuel===
Hydrazine was first used as a [[rocket fuel]] during [[World War II]] for the [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Me 163 B|Messerschmitt Me 163B]] (the first rocket-powered fighter plane), under the code name '''B-Stoff''' (hydrazine [[hydrate]]). When mixed with [[methanol]] ([[M-Stoff]]) and water it was called [[C-Stoff]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Hydrazine is also used as a low-power [[monopropellant]] for the maneuvering thrusters of spacecraft, and the [[Space Shuttle]]'s auxiliary power units (APUs).  In addition, monopropellant hydrazine-fueled rocket engines are often used in terminal descent of spacecraft.  Such engines were used on the [[Viking program]] landers in the 1970s as well as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]] lander and [[Curiosity rover]] which landed on Mars in May 2008 and August 2012, respectively.

In all hydrazine monopropellant engines, the hydrazine is passed by a [[catalyst]] such as [[iridium]] metal supported by high-surface-area [[alumina]] (aluminium oxide) or [[carbon nanofiber]]s,<ref name="Vieira">{{cite journal | last = Vieira | first = R. | coauthors = C.

#3 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> → 4 NH<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>
#N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> → N<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>
#4 NH<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> → 3 N<sub>2</sub> + 8 H<sub>2</sub>

Reactions 1 and 2 are extremely [[exothermic]] (the catalyst chamber can reach 800 °C in a matter of milliseconds,<ref name="Vieira" />) and they produce large volumes of hot gas from a small volume of liquid,<ref name="Chen" /> making hydrazine a fairly efficient thruster propellant with a vacuum [[specific impulse]] of about 220 seconds.<ref>[http://cs.astrium.eads.net/sp/SpacecraftPropulsion/MonopropellantThrusters.html Monopropellant Hydrazine Thrusters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Reaction 3 is [[endothermic]] and so reduces the temperature of the products, but also produces a greater number of molecules.  The catalyst structure affects the proportion of the NH<sub>3</sub> that is dissociated in Reaction 3; a higher temperature is desirable for rocket thrusters, while more molecules are desirable when the reactions are intended to produce greater quantities of gas{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

Other variants of hydrazine that are used as rocket fuel are [[monomethylhydrazine]], (CH<sub>3</sub>)NH(NH<sub>2</sub>) (also known as MMH), and [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]], (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N(NH<sub>2</sub>) (also known as UDMH). These derivatives are used in two-component rocket fuels, often together with [[nitrogen tetroxide]],  N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, sometimes known as [[dinitrogen tetroxide]]. These reactions are extremely exothermic, and the burning is also [[hypergolic]], which means that it starts without any external ignition source.

There are ongoing efforts to replace hydrazine along with other highly toxic substances from the aerospace industry.  Promising alternatives include [[hydroxylammonium nitrate]], [[DMAZ]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powershow.com/view/11713f-M2E0O/Rocket_Propellant_Development_Efforts_at_Purdue_University_powerpoint_ppt_presentation|title=Rocket Propellant Development Efforts at Purdue University - PowerPoint PPT Presentation|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> and energetic ionic liquids.<ref>http://cdn.intechweb.org/pdfs/20222.pdf</ref>

===Fuel cells===
The Italian catalyst manufacturer [[Acta (chemical company)|Acta]] has proposed using hydrazine as an alternative to [[hydrogen]] in [[fuel cell]]s. The chief benefit of using hydrazine is that it can produce over 200 m[[watt|W]]/cm<sup>2</sup> more than a similar hydrogen cell without the need to use expensive [[platinum]] catalysts. As the fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing the hydrazine in a tank full of a double-bonded [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] [[carbonyl]], the fuel reacts and forms a safe solid called [[hydrazone]]. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine  has a higher [[electromotive force]] of 1.56 [[volt|V]] compared to 1.23 V for hydrogen. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.<ref name="The Engineer">[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/303939/Liquid+asset.htm Liquid asset - News - The Engineer - [News: engineering news, engineering info, latest technology, manufacturing news, manufacturing info, automotive news, aerospace news, materials news, research &amp; development&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Hydrazine was used in fuel cells manufactured by [[Allis-Chalmers|Allis-Chalmers Corp.]], including some that provided electric power in space satellites in the 1960s.

===Gun propellant===
A mixture of 63% hydrazine, 32% hydrazine nitrate and 5% water is a standard propellant for experimental bulk-loaded liquid propellant artillery.  The propellant mixture above is notable for being one of the most predictable and stable, with a remarkably flat pressure profile during firing.  Misfires are usually caused by inadequate ignition.  The movement of the shell after a misignition causes a large bubble with a larger ignition surface area, and the greater rate of gas production causes very high pressure, sometimes including catastrophic tube failures (i.e. explosions).<ref>Knapton, John, Stobie, Irvin, Elmore, Les; ARl-TR-81 A review of the Bulk-Loaded Liquid Propellant Gun Program for Possible Relevance to the Electrothermal Chemical Propulsion Program, Army Research Laboratory, March 1993 At [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA263143 Accessed] 2011-7-23</ref>

Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable, especially in the [[anhydrous]] form. According to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]:<blockquote>
Symptoms of acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of hydrazine may include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, dizziness, headache, nausea, [[pulmonary edema]], [[seizures]], [[coma]] in humans.  Acute exposure can also damage the [[liver]], [[kidneys]], and [[central nervous system]]. The liquid is [[corrosive]] and may produce [[dermatitis]] from skin contact in humans and animals. Effects to the [[lungs]], liver, [[spleen]], and [[thyroid]] have been reported in animals chronically exposed to hydrazine via inhalation. Increased incidences of lung, nasal cavity, and liver tumors have been observed in rodents exposed to hydrazine.<ref name="EPA">[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].

Limit tests for hydrazine in pharmaceuticals suggest that it should be in the low ppm range.<ref name="EuroP">[[European Pharmacopeia Scientific Notes]].

Hydrazine may also cause [[steatosis]].<ref>PHM 450 Course, Spring 2009, Michigan State University</ref>
At least one human is known to have died, after 6 months of sublethal exposure to hydrazine hydrate.<ref>International Programme on Chemical Safety, [http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc68.htm ''Environmental Health Criteria for Hydrazine''], Section 9.2.1, dated 1987.

On February 21, 2008, the United States government destroyed the disabled spy satellite [[USA 193]] with a sea-launched missile, reportedly due to the potential danger of a hydrazine release if it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere intact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/aug08/6533|title=IEEE Spectrum Online.
