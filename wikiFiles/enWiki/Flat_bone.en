'''Flat bones''' are those bones which are found where the principal requirement is either extensive protection or the provision of broad surfaces for muscular attachment.  These bones are expanded into broad, flat plates,<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918). (See infobox)</ref> as in the cranium ([[skull]]), the ilium ([[pelvis]]), [[sternum]], [[rib cage]], the sacrum and the [[scapula]].
The flat bones are: the [[occipital bone|occipital]], [[parietal bone|parietal]], [[frontal bone|frontal]], [[nasal bone|nasal]], [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]], [[vomer]], [[scapula]], [[os coxæ]] ([[hip bone]]), [[sternum]], and [[ribs]].<ref name="Gray's" /> In the [[cranial bones]], the layers of compact tissue are familiarly known as the tables of the skull; the outer one is thick and tough; the inner is thin, dense, and brittle, and hence is termed the vitreous table.<ref name="Gray's" />

These bones are composed of two thin layers of [[compact bone]] enclosing between them a variable quantity of [[cancellous bone]],<ref name="Gray's" /> which is the location of red [[bone marrow]]. In an adult, most [[red blood cells]] are formed in flat bones. The intervening cancellous tissue is called the [[diploë]], and this, in certain regions of the skull, becomes absorbed so as to leave spaces filled with air (air-sinuses) between the two tables.<ref name="Gray's" />

==Ossification in flat bones==

[[Ossification]] is started by the formation of layers of undifferentiated [[connective tissue]] that hold the area where the flat bone is to come. On a baby, those spots are known as [[fontanelle]]s. The fontanelles contain connective tissue [[stem cell]]s, which form into [[osteoblast]]s, which secrete [[calcium phosphate]] into a matrix of canals. They form a ring in between the membranes, and begin to expand outwards. As they expand they make a bony matrix.

This hardened matrix forms the body of the bone. Since flat bones are usually thinner than the [[long bone]]s, they only have [[red bone marrow]], rather than both red and [[yellow bone marrow]] (yellow bone marrow being made up of mostly fat). The bone marrow fills the space in the ring of osteoblasts, and eventually fills the bony matrix.

After the bone is completely ossified, the osteoblasts retract their calcium phosphate secreting tendrils, leaving tiny canals in the bony matrix, known as [[canaliculus|canaliculi]]. These canaliculi provide the nutrients needed for the newly transformed osteoblasts, which are now called [[osteocyte]]s. These cells are responsible for the general maintenance of the bone.

A third type of bone cell found in flat bones is called an [[osteoclast]], which destroys the bone using enzymes. There are three reasons that osteoclasts are normally used: the first is for the reparation of bones after a break. They destroy sections of bone that protrude or make reformation difficult. They are also used to obtain necessary calcium from the bones. When a person's blood calcium is low, the osteoclasts take calcium from the bone and put it into the blood for necessary things such as nerve and muscle action. The last reason that osteoclasts are used is for growing. As the bone grows, the shape of the bone also changes. The osteoclasts dissolve the part of the bone that needs to be changed.<ref>Shier, David, Jackie Butler, and Ricki Lewis. "Chapter 7 Skeletal System." Hole's Human Anatomy & Physiology. 11th ed.
