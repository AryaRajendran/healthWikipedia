'''Sleep paralysis''' is a phenomenon in which people, either when falling [[sleep|asleep]] or wakening, temporarily experience an inability to move. More formally, it is a transition state between wakefulness and rest characterized by complete muscle atonia (muscle weakness). It can occur at sleep onset or upon awakening, and it is often associated with terrifying visions (e.g. an intruder in the room), to which one is unable to react due to paralysis. It is believed a result of disrupted [[REM sleep]], which is normally characterized by complete muscle atonia that prevents individuals from acting out their [[dream]]s. Sleep paralysis has been linked to disorders such as [[narcolepsy]], [[migraine]]s, [[anxiety disorder]]s, and [[obstructive sleep apnea]]; however, it can also occur in isolation.<ref name=Ohayon>{{cite journal |last=Ohayon |first=M. |last2=Zulley|first2=J. |last3=Guilleminault|first3=C. |last4=Smirne|first4=S. |title=Prevalence and pathologic associations of sleep paralysis in the general population |journal=Neurology |year=1999 |volume=52 |pages=1194–2000 |doi=10.1212/WNL.52.6.1194 |issue=6}}</ref><ref name=Terrillon>{{cite journal |last=Terrillon |first=J. |last2=Marques-Bonham|first2=S. |title=Does Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis Involve More Than Cognitive Neurosciences? |journal=Journal of Scientific Exploration |year=2001 |volume=15 |pages=97–123}}</ref> When linked to another disorder, sleep paralysis commonly occurs in association with the neuromuscular disorder [[narcolepsy]].<ref name=Terrillon />

==Classification==
The two major classifications of sleep paralysis are ''isolated sleep paralysis (ISP)'' and ''recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (RISP).'' Of these two types, ISP is much more common than RISP.<ref name=Terrillon /> ISP episodes are infrequent and of short duration, approximately one minute. Sleep paralysis might even only occur once in an individual's lifetime.<ref name=Terrillon /> As the name suggests, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis is a chronic condition. The individual suffers from frequent episodes throughout their lifetime.<ref name=Terrillon /> One of the major differences between ISP and RISP is duration. RISP episodes can last for up to an hour or longer, and have a much higher occurrence of perceived [[out of body experiences]]—while ISP episodes are generally short (usually no longer than one minute) and are typically associated with the intruder and [[incubus hallucination]]s. ISP episodes can, however, persist for up to half an hour.<ref name=Terrillon /> With RISP the individual can also suffer back to back episodes of sleep paralysis in the same night while this is unlikely in individuals who suffer from ISP.<ref name=Terrillon />

It can be difficult to differentiate between [[cataplexy]] brought on by narcolepsy and true sleep paralysis, because the two phenomena are physically indistinguishable.<ref name=Terrillon /> The best way to differentiate between the two is to note when the attacks occur most often. Narcolepsy attacks are more common when the individual is falling asleep; ISP and RISP attacks are more common on awakening.<ref name=FISP>{{cite journal |last=Sharpless |first=B. |last2=McCarthy|first2=K.|last3=Chambless|first3=D. |last4=Milrod|first4=B. |last5=Khalsa |first5=S. |last6=Barber |first6=J. |title=Isolated sleep paralysis and fearful isolated sleep paralysis in outpatients with panic attacks |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |year=2010 |volume=66|pages=1292–1306 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20724 |pmid=20715166 |issue=12}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Isolated sleep paralysis is commonly seen in patients that have been diagnosed with narcolepsy. Approximately 30-50% of people that have been diagnosed with narcolepsy have experienced sleep paralysis as an auxiliary symptom.<ref name=Ohayon /><ref name=Dauvilliers>{{cite journal |last=Dauvilliers |first=Y. |last2=Billiard|first2=M. |last3=Montplaisir|first3=J. |title=Clinical aspects and pathophysiology of narcolepsy |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |year=2003 |volume=114 |pages=2000–2017 |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(03)00203-7 |pmid=14580598 |issue=11}}</ref> The prevalence of sleep paralysis in the general population is approximately 6.2%. A majority of the individuals who have experienced sleep paralysis have sporadic episodes that occur once a month to once a year. Only 3% of individuals experiencing sleep paralysis that is not associated with a neuromuscular disorder have nightly episodes, as mentioned earlier, these individuals are diagnosed as having RISP.<ref name=Ohayon /> Sleep paralysis is just as common for males as it is for females, however, different age groups have been found to be more susceptible to developing isolated sleep paralysis. Approximately 36% of the general population that experiences isolated sleep paralysis is likely to develop it between 25 and 44 years of age.<ref name=Ohayon />

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of sleep paralysis has not been concretely identified, although there are several theories about what causes an individual to develop sleep paralysis. The first of these stems from the understanding that sleep paralysis is a [[parasomnia]] resulting from inappropriate overlap of the REM and waking stages of sleep.<ref name=Goldstein>{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=K. |title=Parasomnias|journal=Dis Mon|year=2011|volume=57 |pages=364–88 |doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2011.04.007 |pmid=21807161 |issue=7}}</ref> Polysomnographic studies found that individuals with sleep paralysis had shorter REM sleep latencies than normal along with shortened NREM and REM sleep cycles, and fragmentation of REM sleep.<ref name=Walther>{{cite journal |last=Walther |first=B. |last2=Schulz|first2=H. |title=Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis: Polysomnographic and clinical findings |journal=Somnologie - Schlafforschung und Schlafmedizin|year=2004 |volume=8 |pages=53–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-054X.2004.00017.x |issue=2}}</ref> This study supports the observation that disturbance of regular sleeping patterns can instigate an episode of sleep paralysis, because fragmentation of REM sleep commonly occurs when sleep patterns are disrupted and has now been seen in combination with sleep paralysis.<ref name=Walther />

Another major theory is that the neural bodies that regulate sleep are out of balance in such a way that allows for the different sleep states to overlap.<ref name=Cheyneninenine>{{cite journal |last=Cheyne|first=J. |last2=Rueffer|first2=S. |last3=Newby-Clark|first3=I. |title=Hypnagogic and Hypnopompic Hallucinations during Sleep Paralysis: Neurological and Cultural Construction of the Night-Mare|journal=Consciousness and Cognition |year=1999 |volume=8 |pages=319–337 |doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0404 |pmid=10487786 |issue=3}}</ref> In this case, cholinergic sleep on neural populations are hyper activated and the serotonergic sleep off neural populations are under-activated.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> As a result the cells capable of sending the signals that would allow for complete arousal from the sleep state, the serotonergic neural populations, have difficulty in overcoming the signals sent by the cells that keep the brain in the sleep state.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> Normally during REM sleep the threshold for a stimulus capable of causing arousal is greatly elevated; however, in individuals with SP there is almost no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much easier for the individual to be aroused by a stimulus.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> There may also be a problem with the regulation of [[melatonin]], which under normal circumstances regulates the serotonergic neural populations.<ref name=Terrillon /> Melatonin is typically at its lowest point during REM sleep.<ref name=Terrillon /> Inhibition of melatonin at an inappropriate time would make it impossible for the sleep off neural populations to depolarize when presented with a stimulus that would normally lead to complete arousal.<ref name=Terrillon /> This could explain why the REM and waking stages of sleep overlap during sleep paralysis, and definitely explains the muscle paralysis experienced on awakening.<ref name=Terrillon /> If the effects of the sleep on neural populations cannot be counteracted, we retain characteristics of the REM stage of sleep once we have awoken. Common consequences of sleep paralysis includes headaches, muscle pains or weakness and/or paranoia.

Research has found a genetic component in sleep paralysis.<ref>(Sehgal 2011)</ref> The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence to the idea that sleep paralysis is also genetic.<ref name=Sehgal>{{cite journal |last=Sehgal |first=A. |last2=Mignot|first2=E. |title=Genetics of Sleep and Sleep Disorders |journal=Cell|year=2011 |volume=146 |pages=194–207 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.07.004 |pmid=21784243 |issue=2 |pmc=3153991}}</ref> Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well.<ref name=Sehgal /> The identification of a genetic component means that there is some sort of disruption of function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to determine whether there is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.

==Signs and symptoms==
Physiologically, sleep paralysis is closely related to [[REM atonia]], the paralysis that occurs as a natural part of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM (rapid eye movement) sleep]]. Sleep paralysis occurs either when falling asleep, or when awakening. When it occurs upon falling asleep, the person remains aware while the body shuts down for REM sleep, and it is called [[hypnagogic]] or predormital sleep paralysis. When it occurs upon awakening, the person becomes aware before the REM cycle is complete, and it is called [[hypnopompic]] or postdormital.<ref>http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/sleep-paralysis</ref> The paralysis can last from several seconds to several minutes, with some rare cases being hours, "by which the individual may experience panic symptoms"<ref name="Hersen, Turner 2007 p. 380">Hersen, Turner & Beidel. (2007) Adult Psychopathology and Diagnosis. p. 380</ref> (described below). As the correlation with REM sleep suggests, the paralysis is not entirely complete; use of [[EOG]] traces shows that eye movement is still possible during such episodes; however, the individual experiencing sleep paralysis is unable to speak.<ref>Hearne, K. (1990) The Dream Machine: Lucid dreams and how to control them, p18. ISBN 0-85030-906-9</ref>

Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are symptoms commonly experienced during episodes of sleep paralysis. Some scientists have proposed this condition as an explanation for reports of [[alien abduction]]s and [[ghost]]ly encounters.<ref name="pmid15881271">{{cite journal |author=McNally RJ, Clancy SA. |title=Sleep Paralysis, Sexual Abuse, and Space Alien Abduction |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=113–122 |year=2005|pmid=15881271 |doi=10.1177/1363461505050715}}</ref> A study by [[Susan Blackmore]] and [[Marcus Cox]] (the Blackmore-Cox study) of the [[University of the West of England]] supports the suggestion that reports of alien abductions are related to sleep paralysis rather than to [[temporal lobe]] lability.<ref name="ejufoas">{{cite journal | last = Blackmore | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Blackmore | coauthors = Marcus Cox | title = Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe | journal = European Journal of UFO and Abduction Studies | volume = | issue = 1 | pages = 113–118 | publisher = | location = | date = | url = http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:oDUW-O3VERkJ:www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/ejufoas00.html+%22Alien+Abductions,+Sleep+Paralysis+and+the+Temporal+Lobe%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au&client=firefox-a | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}</ref> There are three main types of these hallucinations that can be linked to pathologic neurophysiology.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> These include the belief that there is an intruder in the room, the [[incubus]], and vestibular motor sensations.<ref name=Cheynetwothree>{{cite journal |last=Cheyne |first=J. |title=Sleep Paralysis and the Structure of Waking-Nightmare Hallucinations |journal=Dreaming |year=2003 |volume=13 |pages=163–179 |doi=10.1023/A:1025373412722 |issue=3}}</ref>

Many people that experience sleep paralysis are struck with a deep sense of terror, because they sense a menacing presence in the room while paralyzed—hereafter referred to as ''the intruder''. This phenomenon is believed to be the result of a hyper vigilant state created in the midbrain.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> More specifically, the emergency response activates in the brain when individuals wake up paralyzed and feel vulnerable to attack.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> This helplessness can intensify the effects of the threat response well above the level typical to normal dreams; this could explain why hallucinations during sleep paralysis are so vivid.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> Normally the threat activated vigilance system is a protective mechanism the body uses to differentiate between dangerous situations and determine whether the fear response is appropriate.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> This threat vigilance system is evolutionarily biased to interpret ambiguous stimuli as dangerous, because "erring on the side of caution" increases survival chances.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> This could explain why those who experience sleep paralysis generally believe the presence they sense is evil.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> The amygdala is heavily involved in the threat activation response mechanism, which is implicated in both intruder and incubus SP hallucinations.<ref name=FISP /> The specific pathway the threat-activated vigilance system acts through is not perfectly understood. It is believed that either the thalamus receives sensory information and sends it on the [[amygdala]], which regulates emotional experience—or that the amygdaloid complex, anterior cingulate, and the structures in the pontine tegmentum interact to create the hallucination.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> It is also highly possible that SP hallucinations could result from a combination of these. The anterior cingulate has an extensive array of cortical connections to other cortical area, which lets it integrate the different sensations and emotions we experience.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> The amygdaloid complex helps us interpret emotional experience and act appropriately.<ref name=Jolkkonen>{{cite journal |last=Jolkkonen |first=E. |last2=Miettinen|first2=R. |last3=Pikkarainen|first3=M. |last4=Pitkänen|first4=A. |title=Projections from the amygdaloid complex to the magnocellular cholinergic basal forebrain in rats|journal=Neuroscience|year=2002|volume=111 |pages=133–149 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(01)00578-4 |pmid=11955718 |issue=1}}</ref> Most importantly, it helps us direct our attention to the most pertinent stimuli in a potentially dangerous situation and act appropriately.<ref name=Jolkkonen /> Proper amygdaloid complex function requires input from the thalamus. This creates a thalamoamygdala pathway capable of bypassing intense scrutiny of incoming stimuli, which allows for quick responses in a potentially life-threatening situation.<ref name=Cheyneninenine/><ref name=Jolkkonen />

Typically these pathways let us quickly disregard non-threatening situations. In sleep paralysis, however, these pathways become over-excited and move into a state of hypervigilance where the mind perceives every external stimulus as a threat. The individual can create endogenous stimuli that contribute to the perceived threat.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> A similar process occurs in the incubus hallucination, with slight variations.

The incubus hallucination is associated with the subject's belief that an intruder is attempting to suffocate them, usually by strangulation.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> It is believed that the incubus hallucination is a combination of the threat vigilance activation system and the muscle paralysis associated with sleep paralysis that removes voluntary control of breathing.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> Several features of REM breathing patterns exacerbate the feeling of suffocation.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> These include shallow rapid breathing, [[hypercapnia]], and slight blockage of the airway, a symptom prevalent in sleep apnea patients.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> Attempts at breathing deeply fail, and give the individual a sense of resistance, which the threat-activated vigilance system interprets as someone sitting on their chest, suffocating them.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> The sensation of entrapment causes a feedback loop that involves the threat-activated vigilance system: fear of suffocation increases as a result of continued helplessness, which makes the individual struggle to end the SP episode.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> The intruder and incubus hallucinations highly correlate with one another, and moderately correlate with the third type of hallucination, vestibular-motor hallucination, also known as out-of-body experiences.<ref name=Cheynetwothree />

The third hallucination type differs from the other two in that it involves the brainstem, cerebellar, and cortical vestibular centers—not the threat activation vigilance system.<ref name=FISP /> Under normal conditions, medial and vestibular nuclei, cortical, thalamic, and cerebellar centers coordinate things such as head and eye movement, and orientation in space.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> In sleep paralysis, these mechanisms—which usually coordinate body movement and provide information on body position—activate and, because there is no actual movement, become confused and induce a floating sensation.<ref name=Cheynetwothree /> The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep.<ref name=Cheyneninenine /> Unlike the other two types of hallucinations, vestibular-motor experiences arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.<ref name=Cheynetwothree />

==Diagnosis==
Sleep paralysis is mainly diagnosed by ruling out other potential sleep disorders that could account for the feelings of paralysis.<ref name=Goldstein /> The main disorder that is checked for is narcolepsy due to the high prevalence of narcolepsy in conjunction with sleep paralysis. The availability of a genetic test for narcolepsy makes this an easy disorder to rule out.<ref name=Sehgal /> Once all other conditions have been ruled out, the description that the patient gives of their episode is compared to the typical experiences of sleep paralysis that have been well documented.<ref name=Goldstein /> If the two descriptions match and no other sleep disorder can account for the symptoms, the patient is diagnosed with sleep paralysis.<ref name=Goldstein />

==Prevention==
Several circumstances have been identified that are associated with an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia and sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, sleeping in the [[supine position]], stress, overuse of stimulants, physical fatigue, as well as certain medications that are used to treat ADHD.<ref name=Terrillon /> It is also believed that there may be a genetic component in the development of RISP due to a high concurrent incidence of sleep paralysis in monozygotic twins.<ref name=Sehgal /> Sleeping in the supine position has been found to be an especially prominent instigator of sleep paralysis.<ref name=Cheynetwotwo>{{cite journal |last=Cheyne |first=J. |title=Situational factors affecting sleep paralysis and associated hallucinations: position and timing effects |journal=Journal of Sleep Research|year=2002|volume=11 |pages=169–177 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2002.00297.x |pmid=12028482 |issue=2}}</ref>

Sleeping in the supine position is believed to make the sleeper more vulnerable to episodes of sleep paralysis because in this sleeping position it is possible for the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway.<ref name=Cheynetwotwo/> This is a possibility regardless of whether the individual has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or not. There may also be a greater rate of microarousals while sleeping in the supine position because there is a greater amount of pressure being exerted on the lungs by gravity.<ref name=Cheynetwotwo/>

While many factors can increase risk for ISP or RISP, they can be avoided with minor lifestyle changes.<ref name=Goldstein /> By maintaining a regular sleep schedule and observing good [[sleep hygiene]], one can reduce chances of sleep paralysis. It helps subjects to reduce the intake of stimulants and stress in daily life by taking up a hobby or seeing a trained psychologist who can suggest coping mechanisms for stress. However, some cases of ISP and RISP involve a genetic factor—which means some people may find sleep paralysis unavoidable.

==Treatment==
Treatment starts with patient education about sleep stages and muscle atonia associated with REM sleep. Patients should be evaluated for [[narcolepsy]] if symptoms persist.<ref>Wills L, Garcia J. Parasomnias: Epidemiology and Management. CNS Drugs [serial online]. December 2002;16(12):803-810.</ref> The safest treatment for sleep paralysis is for people to adopt healthier sleeping habits. However, in serious cases more clinical treatments are available. The most commonly used drugs are [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs).<ref name=Med>{{cite journal |last=Stores|first=G. |title=Medication for sleep-wake disorders|journal=Archives of disease in childhood |year=2003 |volume=88 |pages=899–903 |doi=10.1136/adc.88.10.899 |pmid=14500311 |issue=10 |pmc=1719336}}</ref> Despite the fact that these treatments are prescribed for serious cases of RISP, it is important to note that these drugs are not effective for everyone. There is currently no drug that has been found to completely interrupt episodes of sleep paralysis a majority of the time.<ref name=Med />

==Prognosis==
Sleep paralysis poses no serious health risk to those that experience it, despite the fact that it can be an intensely terrifying experience. [[SUNDS]] is a deadly disorder believed to be related to sleep paralysis; however, they are still considered completely separate disorders, so sleep paralysis sufferers should not be alarmed.<ref name=Terrillon />

==Evolution==
Sleep paralysis may represent an evolutionary atavism. According to Tsoukalas (2012) REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the [[tonic immobility]] reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf. "playing possum"). The neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep, a fact which betrays a deep evolutionary kinship. For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, sympathetic activation, and thermoregulatory changes. This theory, which integrates many earlier findings into a unified and evolutionary well informed framework, also sheds light on the phenomenon of sleep paralysis.<ref name=Tsoukalas2012>Tsoukalas, I. (2012). The origin of REM sleep: A hypothesis. ''Dreaming'', 22(4), 253-283.</ref>

==History==
The original definition of sleep paralysis was codified by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' as ''nightmare'', a term that evolved into our modern definition. Such sleep paralysis was widely considered to be the work of [[demon]]s, and more specifically [[Incubus|incubi]], which were thought to sit on the chests of sleepers. In [[Old English language|Old English]] the name for these beings was ''mare'' or ''mære'' (from a [[proto-Germanic language|proto-Germanic]] ''*marōn'', cf. [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''[[mara (folklore)|mara]]''), hence comes the ''mare'' part in ''nightmare''. The word might be etymologically cognate to [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Marōn'' (in the [[Odyssey]]) and [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Mara (demon)|Māra]]''.

Various forms of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[spiritual possession]] were also advanced as causes. In nineteenth century [[Europe]], the vagaries of diet were thought to be responsible. For example, in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] attributes the [[ghost]] he sees to "... an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato..." In a similar vein, the ''[[Household Cyclopedia]]'' (1881) offers the following advice about nightmares:

:"Great attention is to be paid to regularity and choice of diet. Intemperance of every kind is hurtful, but nothing is more productive of this disease than drinking bad wine. Of eatables those which are most prejudicial are all fat and greasy meats and pastry... Moderate exercise contributes in a superior degree to promote the digestion of food and prevent flatulence; those, however, who are necessarily confined to a sedentary occupation, should particularly avoid applying themselves to study or bodily labor immediately after eating... Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long awake in the night. Passing a whole night or part of a night without rest likewise gives birth to the disease, as it occasions the patient, on the succeeding night, to sleep too soundly. Indulging in sleep too late in the morning, is an almost certain method to bring on the paroxysm, and the more frequently it returns, the greater strength it acquires; the propensity to sleep at this time is almost irresistible."<ref>[http://www.mspong.org/cyclopedia/medicine.html#nightmare The Household Cyclopedia - Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Folklore==
* In [[Scandinavian folklore]], sleep paralysis is caused by a [[Mare (folklore)|mare]], a supernatural creature related to incubi and [[Succubus|succubi]]. The mare is a damned woman, who is cursed and her body is carried mysteriously during sleep and without her noticing. In this state, she visits villagers to sit on their rib cages while they are asleep, causing them to experience nightmares. The Swedish film [[Marianne (2011 film)|''Marianne'']] examines the folklore surrounding sleep paralysis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://lesgivresdlabobine.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/entretien-avec-le-realisateur-filip-tegstedt-a-propos-de-marianne/&ei=BLVqTaK9D4nQceTO_Y0M&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEAQ7gEwBg|title=Interview with director Filip Tegstedt, about Marianne |first=Aurore|last=Bjursell|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>

* Folk belief in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] describe the negative figure of the [[hag]] who leaves her physical body at night, and sits on the chest of her victim. The victim usually wakes with a feeling of terror, has difficulty breathing because of a perceived heavy invisible weight on his or her chest, and is unable to move i.e., experiences sleep paralysis. This nightmare experience is described as being "hag-ridden" in the [[Gullah]] lore. The "Old Hag" was a nightmare spirit in British and also Anglophone North American folklore.

* In [[Fiji]], the experience is interpreted as ''kana tevoro'', being "eaten" by a demon. In many cases the demon can be the spirit of a recently dead relative who has come back for some unfinished business, or has come to communicate some important news to the living. Often persons sleeping near the afflicted person say ''kania, kania'', "eat! eat!" in an attempt to prolong the possession for a chance to converse with the dead relative or spirit and seek answers as to why he or she has come back. The person waking up from the experience is often asked to immediately curse or chase the spirit of the dead relative, which sometimes involves literally speaking to the spirit and telling him or her to go away or using expletives.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

* In [[Turkey]] sleep paralysis is called ''karabasan'', and is similar to other stories of demonic visitation during sleep. A supernatural being, commonly known as a ''[[djinn]]'' (''cin'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), comes to the victim's room, holds him or her down hard enough not to allow any kind of movement, and starts to strangle the person. To get rid of the demonic creature, one needs to pray to [[Allah]] with certain lines from the [[Qur'an]].

This term is occasionally used by English speaking authors to refer to the phenomenon both in academic papers and in [[popular psychology|pop psych]] literature.<ref name="shibaru">{{Cite journal |title=High prevalence of isolated sleep paralysis: kanashibari phenomenon in Japan |last=Fukuda |first=K. |last2=Miyasita |first2=A. |last3=Inugami |first3=M. |last4=Ishihara |first4=K. |journal=Sleep |year=1987 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=279–286 |doi= |pmid=3629091 }}</ref>
* In [[Korean culture]], sleep paralysis is called ''gawi nulim'' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=[[:ko:가위눌림|가위눌림]]}}), literally, "being pressed down by a ghost." It is often associated with a belief that a ghost or spirit is lying on top of or pressing down on the sufferer.
* In [[Mongolian culture]], nightmares in general as well as sleep paralysis is referred to by the verb-phrase ''khar darakh'' (written kara darahu), meaning "to be pressed by the Black" or "when the Dark presses." ''Kara'' means black, and may refer to the dark side personified. ''Kharin buu'' means "shaman of the black" (shamans of the dark side only survive in far-northern [[Mongolia]]), while ''tsaghaan zugiin buu'' means "shaman of the white direction" (referring to shamans who only invoke benevolent spirits). Compare 'karabasan' (the dark presser) in Turkish, which may date from pre-Islamic times when the Turks had the same religion and mythology as the Mongols. See [[Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples]] and [[Tengriism]].

===South-East Asia===
* In [[Cambodian culture|Cambodian]], [[Lao culture|Lao]], and [[Thai culture]] sleep paralysis is called ''phǐǐ am'' ({{IPA-th|pʰǐi.ʔam}}, {{IPA-lo|pʰǐi.ʔàm}}) and ''khmout sukkhot''. It is described as an event in which the person is sleeping and dreams that one or more ghostly figures are nearby or even holding him or her down. The sufferer is unable to move or make any noises. This is not to be confused with ''pee khao'' and ''khmout jool'', ghost possession.
* In [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture, sleep paralysis is understood to be caused by a nocturnal pressing spirit, ''dab tsog''. ''Dab tsog'' attacks "sleepers" by sitting on their chests, sometimes attempting to strangle them. Some believe that ''dab tsog'' is responsible for [[Sudden unexpected death syndrome|sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome]] (SUNDS), which claimed the lives of over 100 Southeast Asian immigrants in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Adler (2011) offers a biocultural perspective on sleep paralysis and the sudden deaths. She suggests that an interplay between the [[Brugada syndrome]] (a genetic cardiac disorder) and the traditional meaning of a ''dab tsog'' attack are at the heart of the sudden deaths.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Shelley R. |year=2011 |title=Sleep Paralysis: Night-mares, Nocebos, and the Mind-Body Connection |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4885-2 }}</ref>

* In New Guinea, people refer to this phenomenon as ''Suk Ninmyo'', believed to originate from sacred trees that use human essence to sustain its life. The trees are said to feed on human essence during night as to not disturb the human's daily life, but sometimes people wake unnaturally during the feeding, resulting in the paralysis.
* In Malay of Malay Peninsula, sleep paralysis is known as ''kena tindih'' (or ''ketindihan'' in Indonesia), which means "being pressed."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sleepclinicjakarta.tblog.com/post/1969898557 |title=Klinik Gangguan Tidur }}</ref> Incidents are commonly considered to be the work of a malign agency; occurring in what are explained as blind spots in the field of vision, they are reported as demonic figures.

===South Asia===
* In [[Pakistan]], sleep paralysis is considered to be an encounter with [[Shaitan]] ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: شيطان ) ([[Satan]]), [[evil]] [[jinn]]s or [[demon]]s who have taken over one's body. Like [[Iran]], this [[ghoul]] is known as 'bakhtak' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: بختک) or 'ifrit'. It is also assumed that it is caused by the [[black magic]] performed by enemies and [[jealous]] persons. People, especially children and young girls, wear [[Ta'wiz]] ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: تعویز) ([[Amulet]]) to ward off [[evil eye]]. [[Spell (paranormal)|Spells]], [[incantation]]s and [[curse]]s could also result in [[ghoul]]s [[haunting]] a person. Some homes and places are also believed to be [[Haunting|haunted]] by [[evil]] [[ghost]]s, [[satan]]ic or other [[supernatural]] beings and they could [[Haunting|haunt]] people living there especially during the night. [[Muslim]] holy persons ([[Imam]]s, [[Maulvi]]s, [[Sufi]]s, [[Mullah]]s, [[Fakir|Faqirs]]) perform [[exorcism]] on individuals who are believed to be [[Demonic possession|possessed]]. The homes, houses, buildings and grounds are [[Blessing|blessed]] and [[Consecration|consecrated]] by [[Mullah]]s or [[Imam]]s by reciting [[Qur'an]] and [[Adhan]] ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: أَذَان), the [[Islam]]ic call to [[Salah|prayer]], recited by the [[muezzin]].

In folklore across Arab countries, the 'kaboos' is believed to be a ''[[Shaitan|shayṭān]]'' or a ''[[ifrit|‘ifrīt]]'' that sits, heavily, on people's chests.
* In [[Turkey|Turkish]] culture, sleep paralysis is often referred to as "karabasan" ("The dark presser/assailer"). It is believed to be a creature that attacks people in their sleep, pressing on their chest and stealing their breath. However, folk legends do not provide a reason why the devil or ifrit does that.
* In [[Persian people|Persian]] culture it is known as 'bakhtak' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: بختک), which is a ghost-like creature that sits on the dreamer's chest, making breathing hard for him/her.
* In [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] culture, sleep paralysis is often referred to as "motakka". It is believed to be a demon that attacks people in their sleep, and particularly children of young age, which they breathe heavily as for "motakka" will be stealing their breath away and keep it out of reach.

===In Kashmir===
In Kashmiri mythology this is caused by an invisible creature called a "pasikdhar". Some people believe that a pasikdhar lives in every house and attacks somebody if the house has not been cleaned or if god is not being worshiped in the house. One also experiences this if one has been doing something evil or drives pleasures from the misfortunes of others.

* In African culture, isolated sleep paralysis is commonly referred to as "the witch riding your back."<ref name="Mattek, 2005 Memoirs p. 34"/><ref name="Katherine Roberts"/>
* Ogun Oru is a traditional explanation for nocturnal disturbances among the Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria; ogun oru (nocturnal warfare) involves an acute night-time disturbance that is culturally attributed to demonic infiltration of the body and psyche during dreaming. Ogun oru is characterized by its occurrence, a female preponderance, the perception of an underlying feud between the sufferer's earthly spouse and a 'spiritual' spouse, and the event of bewitchment through eating while dreaming. The condition is believed to be treatable through Christian prayers or elaborate traditional rituals designed to exorcise the imbibed demonic elements.<ref name="pmid17379609">{{cite journal |author=Aina OF, Famuyiwa OO |title=Ogun Oru: a traditional explanation for nocturnal neuropsychiatric disturbances among the Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria |journal=Transcultural psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=44–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17379609 |doi=10.1177/1363461507074968}}</ref>
* In Zimbabwean Shona culture the word Madzikirira is used to refer something really pressing one down. This mostly refers to the spiritual world in which some spirit&mdash;especially an evil one&mdash;tries to use its victim for some evil purpose. The people believe that witches can only be people of close relations to be effective, and hence a witches often try to use one's spirit to bewitch one's relatives.
* In Ethiopian culture the word 'dukak' (ዱካክ - Amharic) is used, which is believed to be an evil spirit that possesses people during their sleep. Some people believe this experience is linked to use of [[Khat]] ( [[:am:ጫት|ጫት]] 'Chat' - Amharic). Khat users experience sleep paralysis when suddenly quitting chewing [[Khat]] after use for a long time. In [[Amharic]], the official language of Ethiopia, the word 'dukak' taken out of the context of [[Khat]] withdrawal related sleep paralysis, means depression. The evil spirit 'dukak' is an [[anthropomorphism]] (anthropomorphic personification) of the depression that often results from the act of quitting chewing [[Khat]]. 'Dukak' often appears in hallucinations of the quitters and metes out punishments to its victims for offending him by quitting. The punishments are often in the form of implausible physical punishments (e.g., the 'dukak' puts the victim in a bottle and shakes the bottle vigorously) or outrageous tasks the victim must perform (e.g., swallow a bag of gravel).<ref name="gorfu06">{{cite journal | last1 = Gorfu| first1 = M. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2006| title = The Prevalence of Khat –Induced Psychotic Reactions among College Students: A Case in Jimma University College of Agriculture | url = http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ejesc/article/viewFile/41977 | journal = Ethiopian Journal of Education and Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 63–84 | issn= 1998-8907 | doi = 10.4314/ejesc.v2i1.41977 }}</ref>
