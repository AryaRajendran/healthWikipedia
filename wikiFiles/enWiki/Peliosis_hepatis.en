'''Peliosis Hepatis''' is an uncommon [[Blood vessel|vascular]] condition characterised by randomly distributed multiple blood-filled cavities throughout the [[liver]]. The size of the cavities usually ranges between a few millimetres to 3&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name="marvin">{{cite book | last = Sleisenger | first = Marvin | title = Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease | publisher = W.B.

It also occasionally affects [[spleen]], [[lymph node]]s, [[lung]]s, [[kidney]]s, [[adrenal gland]]s, [[bone marrow]] and other parts of [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ichijima K, Kobashi Y, Yamabe H, Fujii Y, Inoue Y |title=Peliosis hepatis.

Peliosis hepatis is often erroneously written "peliosis hepati''ti''s", despite its not being one of the [[hepatitis|hepatitides]].  The correct term arises from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pelios'', i.e. discoloured by extravasated blood, livid,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2380479 |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |accessdate=2007-06-11 |format= |work=}}</ref> and the [[Latin language|Latinized]] [[genitive case]] (hepatis<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2320439 |title=Charlton T.

== Pathophysiology ==
The [[pathogenesis]] of peliosis hepatis is unknown. There are several [[hypotheses]], such as, it arises from [[Sinusoid (blood vessel)|sinusoidal]] epithelial damage,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gushiken FC |title=Peliosis hepatis after treatment with 2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine |journal=South. Med. J. |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=625–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10881786}}</ref> increased sinusoidal pressure due to obstruction in blood outflow from the liver, or hepatocellular [[necrosis]].<ref name="marvin"/> 

Two [[morphology (biology)|morphologic]] patterns of hepatic peliosis were described by Yanoff and Rawson.<ref>{{cite journal |author=YANOFF M, RAWSON AJ |title=PELIOSIS HEPATIS. AN ANATOMIC STUDY WITH DEMONSTRATION OF TWO VARIETIES |journal=Archives of pathology |volume=77 |issue= |pages=159–65 |year=1964 |pmid=14088761}}</ref> In the '''phlebectatic''' type, the blood-filled spaces are lined with [[endothelium]] and are associated with [[aneurysm]]al dilatation of the central vein; in the '''parenchymal''' type, the spaces have no endothelial lining and they usually are associated with haemorrhagic [[parenchyma]]l necrosis. Some consider both patterns to be one process, initiated by focal [[necrosis]] of liver parenchyma, observed in parenchymal type, progressing into formation of [[fibrous]] wall and endothelial lining around [[haemorrhage]] of phebectatic type. [[Fibrosis]], [[cirrhosis]], regenerative nodules, and [[tumours]] may also be seen.

== Clinical features ==
The condition is typically asymptomatic and is discovered following evaluation of abnormal [[liver function test]]. However, when severe it can manifest as [[jaundice]], [[hepatomegaly]], [[liver failure]] and [[haemoperitoneum]].

== Treatment ==
Usually directed towards management of underlying cause. Withdrawal of azathioprine leads to remission in [[Kidney transplantation|renal transplant]], bacillary peliosis responds to antibiotics. In rare circumstances partial resection of liver or [[Liver transplantation|transplant]] may be required.
