'''Polytrauma''' or '''multiple trauma''' is a medical term describing the condition of a person who has been subjected to multiple [[Physical trauma|traumatic injuries]], such as a serious head injury in addition to a serious burn. It is defined via an [[Injury Severity Score]] ISS >=16.<ref>''Pathophysiology of polytrauma'' - Keel, M. & Trentz O. - ''Injury'', Volume 36, Issue 6, Pages 691-709</ref> The term has become common among [[US military]] doctors in describing the seriously injured soldiers returning from ''[[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]'' ([[Iraq]]) and ''[[Operation Enduring Freedom]]'' ([[Afghanistan]]). The term however is generic, and has been in use for a long time for any case involving multiple traumata.

==Civilian medicine==
In civilian life, polytraumas are often associated with [[Car accident|motor vehicle accidents]]. This is because car accidents often occur at a high velocities causing multiple injuries. On admission to hospital any trauma patient should immediately undergo [[Medical imaging|x-ray]] diagnosis of their [[cervical spine]], [[Chest X-Ray|chest]] and their [[pelvis]], commonly known as a 'trauma series', to ascertain possible life threatening injuries. Examples would be a fractured cervical [[vertebra]], a severely fractured pelvis, or a [[haemothorax]]. Once the initial survey is complete, x-rays can be taken of the limbs to assess for other possible fractures. It is also quite common in severe trauma for patients to go straight to [[computed tomography|CT]] or a [[Operating theatre|surgery theatre]] if they require emergency treatment.

[[ECMO]] can  be effective in treating some polytrauma patients with pulmonary or cardiopulmonary failure.<ref>http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572%2810%2900124-3/abstract Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe trauma patients with bleeding shock</ref>

A retrospective study of 93 children (average age of 8.0 +/- 4.1 years) with polytrauma and at least one major musculoskeletal injury showed that 80% of the incidents had been caused in this way (motor vehicle accident).<ref>''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1086883 Factors predictive of immobilization Complications in pediatric polytrauma]'' - Loder, Randall T. et al., ''Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma'' 2001, vol. 15, no5, pp. 338-341</ref>

==Military medicine==

===Overview===
Polytrauma often results from blast injuries sustained by [[improvised explosive devices]], or by a hit with a [[rocket-propelled grenade]], with ''"Improvised explosive devices, blasts, landmines, and fragments account[ing] for 65 percent of combat injuries..."''.<ref name="VHA">[http://www1.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1317 Polytrauma Rehabilitation Procedures] - Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook, Thursday September 22, 2005</ref> The combination of high-pressure waves, explosive fragments, and falling debris may produce multiple injuries including [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], [[amputation|loss of limbs]], [[Burn (injury)|burns]], [[Bone fracture|fracture]]s, [[blindness]] and [[hearing loss]],<ref name="Aux">[http://www.legion-aux.org/supportOurTroops.aspx President's Project: Support for VAMC Polytrauma Centers] (from the [[American Legion Auxiliary]] website)</ref> with 60 percent of those injured in this way having some degree of traumatic brain injury.<ref name="VHA"/>

In some respects, the high incidence of polytrauma in military medicine is in fact a sign of medical advancement, for in previous wars soldiers with such multiple damage types simply did not survive in most cases, even if quickly transferred into hospital care. However, the downside is that many of the victims, although surviving, will never fully regain their previous physical and/or mental form (susceptibility to psychological complications such as [[post traumatic stress disorder|PTSS]].<ref name="VHA"/>

===U.S. treatment===

There are currently four rehabilitation centers in the US specialising in polytrauma (as of 2010). They are managed by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] and are located in [[Minneapolis, MN]]; [[Palo Alto, CA]]; [[Richmond, VA]]; and [[Tampa, FL]].<ref name="Aux"/> In addition to the actual intensive care insofar as still required, these hospitals mainly specialize in [[Physical therapy|rehabilitative treatment]]. In addition the Department of Veterans Affairs has 18 polytrauma network sites, located throughout the country. As of April 2007, the Department of Veterans Affairs has treated over 350 service members in their inpatient centers.

The treatment and rehabilitative care for polytrauma [[patient]]s is a very extensive and time-consuming activity. The recommended staffing numbers (FTE  = Full Time Equivalent) for six rehabilitation treatment beds are:<ref name="VHA"/>

<table><tr><td valign=top>
*0.5 FTE - [[Physician]] Discipline FTE Rehabilitation
*5.5 FTE - [[Nurse|Registered Nurse]] (1.0 must be CRRN)
*4.0 FTE - Licensed Practical Nurse and/or Certified Nursing Assistant
*0.5 FTE - Nurse Manager
*0.5 FTE - Clinical Case Manager, Admission and Follow-up
*1.0 FTE - [[Social Worker]] Case Manager

*0.5 FTE - [[Recreational therapy|Recreation Therapist]]
*0.5 FTE - [[Psychotherapy|Counseling Psychologist]]

In other words - 2.8 people are required full-time (24h), for every patient, often for months, while some care may be required for life.
