'''Cervical cancer''' is a [[malignant]] [[neoplasm]] arising from cells originating in the [[cervix uteri]]. One of the most common symptoms of cervical [[cancer]] is abnormal [[vaginal bleeding]], but in some cases there may be no obvious symptoms until the cancer has progressed to an advanced [[cancer staging|stage]].<ref name=Robbins/>  Treatment usually consists of [[surgery]] (including ''local excision'') in early stages, and [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiotherapy]] in more advanced stages of the disease.

[[Cancer screening]] using the [[Pap smear]] can identify precancerous and potentially precancerous changes in cervical cells and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].  Treatment of high-grade changes can prevent the development of cancer in many victims. In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical screening programs has dramatically reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer.<ref name="pmid10735343" />

The cervix is the narrow portion of the uterus where it joins with the top of the vagina.  Most cervical cancers are [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s, arising in the [[squamous epithelium|squamous (flattened) epithelial cells]] that line the cervix.  [[Adenocarcinoma]], arising in glandular [[epithelial cells]] is the second most common type.  Very rarely, cancer can arise in other types of cells in the cervix.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Gray1167.svg|thumb|Cervix in relation to upper part of vagina and posterior portion of uterus.]]
The early stages of cervical cancer may be completely [[asymptomatic]].<ref name=Robbins/><ref name="pmid10735343"/> [[Vaginal bleeding]], contact bleeding, or (rarely) a vaginal mass may indicate the presence of malignancy. Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer. In advanced disease, [[metastasis|metastases]] may be present in the [[abdomen]], [[human lung|lung]]s or elsewhere.

Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pelvic pain, back pain, leg pain, swollen legs, heavy bleeding from the vagina, bone fractures, and/or (rarely) leakage of urine or faeces from the vagina.<ref name='MedLine Plus Cerv Cancer'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000893.htm |title=Cervical cancer |accessdate=2007-12-02 |last=Nanda |first=Rita |date=2006-06-09 |work=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] }}</ref>

[[Genital warts]], which are a form of [[benign]] [[tumor]] of [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer. It is common to have multiple strains at the same time, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts. The medically accepted paradigm, officially endorsed by the American Cancer Society and other organizations, is that a patient must have been infected with HPV to develop cervical cancer, and is hence viewed as a [[sexually transmitted disease]] (although many dispute that, technically, it is the causative agent, not the cancer, that is a sexually transmitted disease), but most women infected with high risk HPV will not develop cervical cancer.<ref name="pmid16362994">{{cite journal | author = Snijders PJ, Steenbergen RD, Heideman DA, Meijer CJ | title = HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis: concepts and clinical implications | journal = J.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ca cervicis uteri T2 SAG.jpg|thumb|Cervical cancer seen on a T2 weighted saggital MR image of the pelvis.]]

===Biopsy===
While the pap smear is an effective [[screening test]], confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or pre-cancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through [[colposcopy]], a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute [[acetic acid]] (e.g. [[vinegar]]) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix.<ref name=Robbins/> Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include [[punch forceps]], [[SpiraBrush CX]], [[SoftBiopsy]] or [[Soft-ECC]].

Colposcopic impression, the estimate of disease severity based on the visual inspection, forms part of the diagnosis.

Further diagnostic and treatment procedures are [[loop electrical excision procedure]] (LEEP) and [[conization]], in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]].

[[File:Squamous carcinoma of the cervix.jpg|right|thumb|This large squamous carcinoma (bottom of picture) has obliterated the cervix and invaded the lower uterine segment. The uterus also has a round [[leiomyoma]] up higher.]]
[[File:Adenosquamous carcinoma high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a ''(cervical) adenosquamous carcinoma'', a type of cervical cancer. [[H&E stain]].]]

===Precancerous lesions===
[[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]], the potential precursor to cervical cancer, is often diagnosed on examination of cervical biopsies by a [[pathology|pathologist]].  For premalignant dysplastic changes, the CIN ([[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]]) grading is used.

The naming and [[histology|histologic]] classification of cervical carcinoma percursor lesions has changed many times over the 20th century.  The [[World Health Organization]] classification<ref name=CAresearchUK /><ref name=DeMay>{{cite book|author=DeMay, M| year=2007| title=Practical principles of cytopathology.  Revised edition.| isbn=978-0-89189-549-7|publisher=American Society for Clinical Pathology Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> system was descriptive of the lesions, naming them mild, moderate or severe [[dysplasia]] or [[carcinoma in situ]] (CIS).  The term, [[Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia]] (CIN) was developed to place emphasis on the spectrum of abnormality in these lesions, and to help standardise treatment.<ref name=DeMay />  It classifies mild dysplasia as CIN1, moderate dysplasia as CIN2, and severe dysplasia and CIS as CIN3.  More recently, CIN2 and CIN3 have been combined into CIN2/3.  These results are what a pathologist might report from a biopsy.

These should not be confused with the [[Bethesda System]] terms for Pap smear ([[cytopathology]]) results.  Among the Bethesda results: [[LSIL|Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL)]] and [[HSIL|High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL)]].  An LSIL Pap may correspond to CIN1, and HSIL may correspond to CIN2 and CIN3,<ref name=DeMay /> however they are results of different tests, and the Pap smear results need not match the histologic findings.

===Cancer subtypes===
[[Histopathology|Histologic]] subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic324.htm#section~workup |title=Cervical Cancer |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author = Garcia A  Hamid O, El-Khoueiry A | date = 2006-07-06 |work=eMedicine |publisher=[[WebMD]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Dolinsky | coauthors= | title=Cervical Cancer: The Basics | date=2006-07-17 | publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania|Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania]] | url =http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/types/article.cfm?c=6&s=17&ss=129&id=8226 | work =OncoLink | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | language = }}</ref>  Though squamous cell carcinoma is the cervical cancer with the most incidence, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix has been increasing in recent decades.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book| author= Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N, Mitchell RN | year = 2007 | title = Robbins Basic Pathology| edition = (8th ed.)| publisher = Saunders Elsevier| pages=718–721 | isbn= 978-1-4160-2973-1}}</ref>

Note that the FIGO stage does not incorporate [[lymph node]] involvement in contrast to the [[TNM staging system|TNM]] staging for most other cancers.

For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage but is not to replace the original clinical stage.

===Staging===
{{Main|Cervical cancer staging}}
Cervical cancer is staged by the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO) staging system, which is based on clinical examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only the following diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, [[colposcopy]], endocervical [[curettage]], [[hysteroscopy]], [[cystoscopy]], [[proctoscopy]], intravenous [[urography]], and [[X-ray]] examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical [[conization]].

==Prevention {{Anchor | prevention}}==
===Screening===

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially precancerous changes in the cervix.

==Treatment==
The treatment of cervical cancer varies worldwide, largely due to large variances in disease burden in developed and developing nations, access to surgeons skilled in radical pelvic surgery, and the emergence of "fertility sparing therapy" in developed nations.  Because cervical cancers are radiosensitive, radiation may be used in all stages where surgical options do not exist.

Microinvasive cancer (stage IA) may be treated by [[hysterectomy]] (removal of the whole uterus including part of the [[vagina]]). For stage IA2, the [[lymph node]]s are removed as well. Alternatives include local surgical procedures such as a [[loop electrical excision procedure]] (LEEP) or [[Cervical conization|cone biopsy]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Shannon | last=Erstad | coauthors= | title=Cone biopsy (conization) for abnormal cervical cell changes | date=2007-01-12 | publisher=[[WebMD]] | url =http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/cone-biopsy-conization-for-abnormal-cervical-cell-changes | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | language = }}</ref>  For 1A1 disease, a cone biopsy (aka ''cervical conization'') is considered curative.

Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the patient is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the patient has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1b cancers and some stage 1a cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.

A radical trachelectomy can be performed abdominally<ref name="pmid15918265">{{cite journal | author = Cibula D, Ungár L, Svárovský J, Zivný J, Freitag P | title = [Abdominal radical trachelectomy--technique and experience] | language = Czech | journal = Ceska Gynekol | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–22 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15918265 | doi =  }}</ref> or vaginally<ref name="pmid15936061">{{cite journal | author = Plante M, Renaud MC, Hoskins IA, Roy M | title = Vaginal radical trachelectomy: a valuable fertility-preserving option in the management of early-stage cervical cancer.

Early stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4&nbsp;cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or [[radiation therapy]]. Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and [[brachytherapy]] (internal radiation). Patients treated with surgery who have high risk features found on pathologic examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy in order to reduce the risk of relapse.

Larger early stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4&nbsp;cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and [[cisplatin]]-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires [[adjuvant]] radiation therapy), or cisplatin chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy.

Advanced stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and [[cisplatin]]-based chemotherapy.

On June 15, 2006, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, [[hycamtin]] and [[cisplatin]] for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=FDA Approves First Drug Treatment for Late-Stage Cervical Cancer | date=2006-06-15 | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | url =http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01391.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | language = }}</ref> Combination treatment has significant risk of [[neutropenia]], [[anemia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]] side effects. Hycamtin is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on the stage of the cancer. With treatment, the 5-year [[relative survival rate]] for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is 92%, and the overall (all stages combined) 5-year survival rate is about 72%.  These statistics may be improved when applied to women newly diagnosed, bearing in mind that these outcomes may be partly based on the state of treatment five years ago when the women studied were first diagnosed.<ref name='ACS Key Stats'>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_1X_What_are_the_key_statistics_for_cervical_cancer_8.asp?sitearea= |title=What Are the Key Statistics About Cervical Cancer? |accessdate=2007-12-02 |date=2006-08-04 |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030194439/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_1X_What_are_the_key_statistics_for_cervical_cancer_8.asp?sitearea= <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-30}}</ref>

With treatment, 80 to 90% of women with stage I cancer and 60 to 75% of those with stage II cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis. Survival rates decrease to 30 to 40% for women with stage III cancer and 15% or fewer of those with stage IV cancer 5 years after diagnosis.<ref name=merck>{{cite web | title =Cervical Cancer| work =Cervical Cancer: Cancers of the Female Reproductive System: Merck Manual Home Edition | url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch252/ch252d.html | publisher=Merck Manual Home Edition | accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, survival improves when radiotherapy is combined with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Committee on Practice Bulletins-Gynecology | title = ACOG practice bulletin. Diagnosis and treatment of cervical carcinomas, number 35, May 2002 | journal = Obstetrics and gynecology | volume = 99 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11978302 | doi =  }}</ref>

As the cancer metastasizes to other parts of the body, prognosis drops dramatically because treatment of local lesions is generally more effective than whole body treatments such as chemotherapy.

Interval evaluation of the patient after therapy is imperative. Recurrent cervical cancer detected at its earliest stages might be successfully treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of the three. Thirty-five percent of patients with invasive cervical cancer have persistent or recurrent disease after treatment.<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | title =Cervical Cancer| work =Cervical Cancer: Pathology, Symptoms and Signs, Diagnosis, Prognosis and Treatment | url=http://www.health.am/cr/cervical-cancer/ | publisher=Armenian Health Network, Health.am }}</ref>

Average [[years of potential life lost]] from cervical cancer are 25.3 (SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975-2000, National Cancer Institute (NCI)). Approximately 4,600 women were projected to die in 2001 in the US of cervical cancer (DSTD), and the annual incidence was 13,000 in 2002 in the US, as calculated by SEER. Thus the ratio of deaths to incidence is approximately 35.4%.

Regular screening has meant that pre cancerous changes and early stage cervical cancers have been detected and treated early. Figures suggest that cervical screening is saving 5,000 lives each year in the UK by preventing cervical cancer.<ref name=chelp>{{cite web | title =Cervical cancer statistics and prognosis | url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=9260 | publisher=Cancer Research UK | accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>
About 1,000 women per year die of cervical cancer in the UK.

In the European Union, there were about 34,000 new cases per year and over 16,000 deaths due to cervical cancer in 2004.<ref name="Arbyn10" />

In the United Kingdom, the age-standardised (European) incidence is 8.5/100,000 per year (2006). It is the twelfth most common cancer in women, accounting for 2% of all female cancers, and is the second most common cancer in the under 35s females, after breast cancer.
The UK's European age-standardised mortality is 2.4/100,000 per year (2007) (Cancer Research UK Cervical cancer statistics for the UK).<ref>http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/cervix/mortality/</ref> With a 42% reduction from 1988-1997 the NHS implemented screening programme has been highly successful, screening the highest risk age group (25–49 years) every 3 years, and those ages 50–64 every 5 years.

In Canada, an estimated 1,300 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2008 and 380 will die.<ref>{{cite journal | author = MacDonald N, Stanbrook MB, Hébert PC | title = Human papillomavirus vaccine risk and reality | language = French | journal = CMAJ | volume = 179 | issue = 6 | pages = 503, 505 | year = 2008 | month = September | pmid = 18762616 | pmc = 2527393 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.081238 }}</ref>

In Australia, there were 734 cases of cervical cancer (2005).  The number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer has dropped on average by 4.5% each year since organised screening began in 1991 (1991–2005).<ref>http://www.papscreen.org.au/browse.asp?ContainerID=c15</ref>
Regular two-yearly Pap tests can reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by up to 90% in Australia, and save 1,200 Australian women dying from the disease each year.<ref>http://www.papscreen.org.au/</ref>

==History==
* 400 BCE - [[Hippocrates]]: cervical cancer incurable
* 1925 - [[Hans Hinselmann|Hinselmann]]: invented [[colposcope]]
* 1928 - [[Georgios Papanikolaou|Papanicolaou]]: developed Papanicolaou technique
* 1941 - Papanicolaou and Trout: [[Pap smear]] screening
* 1946 - Ayer: [[Aylesbury spatula]] to scrape the cervix, collecting sample for Pap smear
* 1951 - First successful in-vitro cell line, [[HeLa]], derived from biopsy of cervical cancer of [[Henrietta Lacks]]
* 1976 - [[Harald zur Hausen|Zur Hausen]] and Gisam: found HPV DNA in cervical cancer and warts
* 1988 - [[Bethesda System]] for reporting Pap results developed
* 2006 - First [[HPV vaccine]] FDA approved

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiologists]] working in the early 20th century noted that cervical cancer behaved like a sexually transmitted disease. In summary:
# Cervical cancer was common in female [[sex worker]]s.
# It was rare in [[nun]]s, except for those who had been sexually active before entering the convent. (Rigoni in 1841)
# It was more common in the second wives of men whose first wives had died from cervical cancer.
# It was rare in Jewish women.<ref name="pmid12674663">{{cite journal | author = Menczer J | title = The low incidence of cervical cancer in Jewish women: has the puzzle finally been solved? | journal = Isr. Med. Assoc. J. | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 120–3 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12674663 | doi =  | url = http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar03feb-11.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref>
# In 1935, Syverton and Berry discovered a relationship between RPV (Rabbit Papillomavirus) and skin cancer in [[rabbit]]s. (HPV is species-specific and therefore cannot be transmitted to rabbits)

This led to the suspicion that cervical cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted agent. Initial research in the 1940s and 1950s put the blame on [[smegma]] (e.g. Heins ''et al.'' 1958).<ref name = "Heins1958">{{cite journal | author = Heins Jr HC, EJ Dennis, HR Pratt-Thomas | title = The possible role of smegma in carcinoma of the cervix | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 726–33 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13583012 | doi =  }}</ref> During the 1960s and 1970s it was suspected that infection with [[herpes simplex virus]] was the cause of the disease. In summary, [[Herpes simplex virus|HSV]] was seen as a likely cause<ref name="pmid4352386">{{cite journal | author = Alexander ER, EJ Dennis, HR Pratt-Thomas | title = Possible Etiologies of Cancer of the Cervix Other Than Herpesvirus | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1485–90 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4352386 | doi =  | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4352386 }}</ref> because it is known to survive in the female reproductive tract, to be transmitted sexually in a way compatible with known risk factors, such as promiscuity and low socioeconomic status. Herpes viruses were also implicated in other malignant diseases, including [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], [[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], [[Marek's disease]] and the Lucké renal adenocarcinoma. HSV was recovered from cervical tumour cells.

A description of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) by [[electron microscopy]] was given in 1949, and HPV-DNA was identified in 1963.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} It was not until the 1980s that HPV was identified in cervical cancer tissue.<ref name="pmid6304740">{{cite journal | author = Dürst M, Gissmann L, Ikenberg H, zur Hausen H | title = A papillomavirus DNA from a cervical carcinoma and its prevalence in cancer biopsy samples from different geographic regions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 80 | issue = 12 | pages = 3812–5 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6304740 | pmc = 394142 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.80.12.3812 }}.</ref>  It has since been demonstrated that HPV is implicated in virtually all cervical cancers.<ref name="pmid16670757"/> Specific viral subtypes implicated are HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 and others.

In work that was initiated in the mid 1980s, the HPV vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at [[Georgetown University]] Medical Center, the [[University of Rochester]], the [[University of Queensland]] in Australia, and the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]].<ref>

==Society and culture==
A 2007 survey of  3,076 American women found only 40% had heard of HPV infection and less than half of those knew it causes cervical cancer.<ref name="pmid17267388">{{cite journal | author = Tiro JA, Meissner HI, Kobrin S, Chollette V | title = What do women in the U.S. know about human papillomavirus and cervical cancer? | journal = Cancer Epidemiol.
