'''Denture-related stomatitis''' (also termed '''denture sore mouth'''<ref name="OMF path textbook" />, '''denture stomatitis'''<ref name="OMF path textbook" />, '''chronic atrophic candidiasis''',<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> '''Candida-associated denture induced stomatitis''',<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook">{{cite book|last=Tyldesley|first=Anne Field, Lesley Longman in collaboration with William R.|title=Tyldesley's Oral medicine|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0192631470|pages=35-40|edition=5th ed.}}</ref> and '''denture-associated erythematous stomatitis''')<ref name="Manfredi 2012">{{cite journal|last=Manfredi|first=M|coauthors=Polonelli, L; Aguirre-Urizar, J; Carrozzo, M; McCullough, M|title=Urban legends series: oral candidosis.|journal=Oral diseases|date=2012 Aug 14|pmid=22998462}}</ref> is a common condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral [[mucous membrane]] occurs beneath a [[denture]]. In about 90% of cases, ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' species are involved. This is normally a harmless component of the oral [[microbiota (disambiguation)|microbiota]] in many people. Denture-related stomatitis is the most common form of [[oral candidiasis]] (a yeast infection of the mouth). It is more common in elderly people, and in those who wear a complete upper denture (a denture which replaces all the upper teeth, worn by someone with no natural teeth in their upper jaw). Denture-related stomatitis is more likely to develop when the denture is left constantly in the mouth, rather than removing it during sleep, and when the denture is not cleaned regularly.

==Classification==
The Newton classification divides denture-related stomatitis into three types based on severity. Type one may represent an early stage of the condition, whilst type two is the most common and type three is uncommon.<ref name="OMF med textbook">{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|pages=201-203|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref><ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> 
* Type 1 - Localized inflammation or pinpoint [[hyperemia]]
* Type 2 - More diffuse [[erythema]] (redness) involving part or all of the mucosa which is covered by the denture
* Type 3 - Inflammatory nodular/papillary [[hyperplasia]] usually on the central hard palate and the [[alveolar ridge]]

==Signs and symptoms==
Despite the alternative name for this condition, "denture sore mouth", it is usually painless and asymptomatic.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> The appearance of the involved mucosa is erythematous and [[edema|edematous]] (swollen),<ref name="OMF med textbook" /> sometimes
with [[petechiae|petechial hemorrhage]].<ref name="OMF path textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W. Neville , Douglas D. Damm, Carl M. Allen, Jerry E.|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0721690033|pages=192-194|edition=2. ed.}}</ref> This usually occurs beneath an upper denture.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" /> --> Sometimes [[angular cheilitis]] can coexist,<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" /> --> which is inflammation of the corners of the mouth, also often associated with ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Stomatitis rarely develops under a lower denture.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> The affected mucosa is often sharply defined, in the shape of the covering denture.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" />

==Causes==
The major risk factor for the development of this condition is wearing an upper complete denture, particularly when it is not removed during sleep and cleaned regularly.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> Older dentures are more likely to be involved.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> Other factors include [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth),<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> [[diabetes]]<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> or a high [[carbohydrate]] diet.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> [[Human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) can rarely be an underlying factor.<ref name="OMF med textbook" /> 

Wearing dental applicances such as dentures alters the oral microbiota.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> A microbial plaque composed of bacteria and/or yeasts forms on the fitting surface of the denture<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> (the surface which rests against the palate) and on the mucosa which is covered. Over time, this plaque may be colonized by Candida species.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> The local environment under a denture is more acidic and less exposed to the cleansing action of [[saliva]], which favors high Candida enzymatic activity and may cause inflammation in the mucosa.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> ''C. albicans'' is the most commonly isolated organism, but occasionally bacteria are implicated.<ref name="OMF med textbook" />  

There is controversy as to whether this condition represents a true infection by ''C. albicans'' or just a reaction to the various micro-organisms present underneath a denture.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> -->  It has been reported that often the surface of the denture shows positive culture for ''Candida'' but [[biopsy|biospsies]] of the mucosa rarely show [[hyphae]] invading [[epithelium]].<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> Similarly, microbiologic swabs of the involved mucosa show a much less heavy colonization than the surface of the denture.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> This has lead some to conclude that the defining feature of a true infection is absent in denture-related stomatitis.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> 

Poorly fitting dentures may cause pressure on the mucosa and mechanical irritation may create a similar clinical appearance, but this is uncommon.<!-- <ref name="OMF path textbook" /> --> An [[orthodontic appliance]] may uncommonly produce a similar result.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> Rarely, allergic reactions of the mucosa in response to incomplete curing of the acrylic resin (the prosthetic material) may also be an involved factor.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> 

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is usually made based upon the clinical appearance, and swabs can be taken of the surface of the denture.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> Investigations to rule out possibility of diabetes may be indicated.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" /> --> Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated,<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" /> but if taken shows [[histology|histologic]] evidence of proliferative or degenerative responses and reduced [[keratinization]] and epithelial [[atrophy]].<ref name="OMF med textbook" />

==Treatment==
The most important aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with ''C. albicans'' which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. [[hypochlorite]], which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. [[benzoic acid]]), yeast lytic enzymes and [[proteolytic enzyme]]s (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which [[Route of administration#Topical|topical]] [[antifungal medication]]s are used (e.g. [[nystatin]], [[amphotericin]], [[miconazole]], [[fluconazole]] or [[itraconazole]]). Often a antimicrobial mouthwash such as [[chlorhexidine]] is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.<ref name="OMF med textbook" />

==Prognosis==
Denture-related stomatitis is usually a harmless condition with no long term consequences. It usually resolves with simple measures such as improved denture hygiene or topical antifungal medication. In severely immunocompromised individuals (e.g. those with HIV), the infection may present a more serious threat. 

==Epidemiology==
Denture-related stomatitis is common and occurs worldwide.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> Usually the people affected are middle aged or elderly, with females being affected slightly more commonly than males.<!-- <ref name="OMF med textbook" />  --> Prevalences of up to 70% have been reported in elderly care home residents.<ref name="OMF med textbook" /> It is by far the most common type of oral candidiasis.<ref name="Tyldesley OM textbook" />
