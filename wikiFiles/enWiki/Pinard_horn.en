A '''Pinard horn''' is a medical device used to monitor the heart rate of a [[fetus]] during pregnancy. It is a type of [[stethoscope]], formerly called a "fetoscope",<ref>The term "fetoscope" now refers to the fetal endoscope used in [[fetoscopy]].</ref> but the term is still sometimes associated with the Pinard stethoscope. The horn is made of wood or metal and is hollow. It is about 8 inches long. It functions similarly to an [[ear trumpet]] by amplifying sound. The wide end of the horn is held against the pregnant woman's belly, while the doctor, nurse, or midwife listens through the other end.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robbie Davis-Floyd, Carolyn Fishel Sargent|title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520207851|pages=360}}</ref>

==History==
The Pinard horn was invented by Dr. [[Adolphe Pinard]], a French obstetrician, during the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robbie Davis-Floyd, Carolyn Fishel Sargent|title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520207851|pages=360}}</ref> Pinard was an early supporter of advancements in prenatal care, including closer fetal health monitoring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Jeffrey P.|title=The Machine in the Nursery: Incubator Technology and the Origins of Newborn Intensive Care|year=1996|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801851735|pages=58}}</ref>

==Current use==
Pinard horns continue to be used around the world, particularly by midwives, but also by doctors and nurses. Pinard horns are the most common fetal stethoscopes in much of Europe, even today, which surprises some doctors from the United States, where a [[Doppler ultrasound]] is standard.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ina May Gaskin, Ani DiFranco|title=Birth Matters: A Midwife's Manifesta|year=2011|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781583229279|pages=112â€“3}}</ref> It is still considered a practical device. It provides an alternative to more expensive technology, such as the Doppler ultrasound procedure. A midwife in Mexico describes using the Pinard horn:
{{blockquote|Sometimes we listen to the fetal heart rate with the Pinard, but if the woman is very sensitive, and it bothers her to push into her belly with the Pinard horn, then we use the Doppler. But the Doppler often transmits a lot of noise; it gets confusing. So better with the Pinard.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robbie Davis-Floyd, Lesley Barclay, Jan Tritten|title=Birth Models that Work|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520248632|pages=310}}</ref>}}

A Pinard horn may be used to determine the position of the fetus. A Pinard horn is more precise than a Doppler ultrasound for this purpose. A Doppler device detects a heart tone farther away from the location of origin. A Pinard horn must be pressed to a location very close to the fetal heart in order to detect it, providing a more accurate indication of fetal position. A doctor, nurse, or midwife can also use [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] to determine fetal position.<ref>{{cite book|last=Penny Simkin, Ruth Ancheta|title=The Labor Progress Handbook: Early Interventions to Prevent and Treat Dystocia|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444337716|pages=61}}</ref>
