'''Donepezil''', marketed under the trade name '''Aricept''' by its developer [[Eisai Co.|Eisai]] and partner [[Pfizer]], is a centrally acting reversible [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid16437430">{{cite journal

It has an [[oral bioavailability]] of 100% and easily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]].  Because it has a [[half-life]] of about 70 hours, it can be taken once a day.

===Alzheimer's disease===
Currently, no definitive proof shows the use of donepezil or other similar agents alters the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 6 to 12-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition and/or behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steele LS, Glazier RH
 |title=Is donepezil effective for treating Alzheimer's disease? |journal=Can Fam Physician
 |volume=45 |issue= |pages=917–9 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10216789 |pmc=2328349 }}</ref>  Pilot studies have reported donepezil therapy may potentially have effects on markers of disease progression, such as [[hippocampal]] volume.  Therefore, many neurologists, psychiatrists, and primary-care physicians use donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In 2005, the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) withdrew its recommendation for use of the drug for mild-to-moderate AD, on the basis of no significant improvement in functional outcome, quality of life, or behavioral symptoms. However, NICE revised its guidelines to suggest donepezil be used in moderate-stage patients for whom the evidence is strongest.  

While the drug is currently indicated for mild to moderate Alzheimer's, evidence from two clinical trials also indicates it may be effective for moderate to severe disease.  An example of this is a [[Karolinska Institute]] paper published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in early 2006, which states donepezil improves cognitive function even in patients with severe AD symptoms.<ref>{{cite web

===Dosage===
[[File:Aricept 10mg 000195lg.jpg|left|thumb|10mg Aricept pill]]
In mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease, a starting dose of 5&nbsp;mg given once daily should be used. In a minimum of four to six weeks, an increase to 10&nbsp;mg is recommended. The usual dose is 5 to 10&nbsp;mg once daily. Moderate to severe AD indicates the same regimen, but in a minimum of three months, a patient may receive a dose of 23&nbsp;mg once daily. Dementia patients should receive 5–10&nbsp;mg once daily. The maximum daily dose is 23&nbsp;mg once daily.<ref name="ReferenceA">Aricept (donepezil hydrochloride) package insert. Woodcliff Lake, NJ: Eisai Co., Ltd.; 2010 Nov.</ref> Clinicians should use caution in prescribing the maximum daily dose as the risk of severe side effects may outweigh the unclear clinical benefits.<ref>How the FDA forgot the Evidence: the case of Donepezil 23 mg. BMJ 2012;344:e1086</ref> In the UK, the maximum licensed dose is 10&nbsp;mg.

===Contraindications===
Donepezil (Aricept) should be used with caution in patient with cardiac disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmias and sick sinus syndrome. 
Patients with gastrointestinal disorders should use caution because nausea or vomiting may occur. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, patients who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The British Medical Journal (BMJ) cautioned that the largest dosage, 23&nbsp;mg, was crafted to extend patent protection rather than for medical reasons,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/22/health/la-he-aricept-fda-20120323 LA Times, 2012-03-22] New Alzheimer's Pill Likely To Cause Misery</ref> and was not shown to be more effective compared to the 10&nbsp;mg dose.

===Other===
Donepezil has been tested (off label) in other cognitive disorders, including [[Lewy body dementia]],<ref name=pmid11215841>{{cite journal |author=Rojas-Fernandez CH

 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18198262 }}</ref>

Donepezil has also been studied in patients with [[mild cognitive impairment]], [[schizophrenia]], [[attention deficit disorder]], post[[coronary bypass]] cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[CADASIL syndrome]], and [[Down syndrome]]. A three-year [[National Institutes of Health]] trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the [[apolipoprotein]] E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study (Petersen 2005). At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. 

Recent studies suggest donepezil can improve speech in children with autism. The studies found the speech of autistic children who were mildly to moderately affected appeared to improve from the use of donepezil.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/22/16-a

== Adverse effects ==
Common side effects include [[bradycardia]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[abdominal pain]], and vivid dreams.  In 2006 Eisai, the manufacturer, issued a statement that a single vascular dementia study found a difference in the percentage of study participants who died in the donepezil group (1.7%) versus the placebo group (0%), and this could be due to an unusually low death rate on the placebo group.  An analysis of all three vascular dementia trials, according to Eisai, "shows no statistically significant differences in observed mortality rates between the donepezil and placebo groups." A physician has reported several cases of mania.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benazzi F |title=Mania associated with donepezil
