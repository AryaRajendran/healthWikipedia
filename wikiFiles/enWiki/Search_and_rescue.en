'''Search and rescue''' ('''SAR''' or '''S&R''') is the search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger.<ref name="CF">{{cite web|url = http://www.casaraontario.ca/~webmaster1/Manuals/NationalSARmanual_full_english.pdf|format=PDF|title = B–GA–209–001/FP–001 DFO 5449 NATIONAL SAR MANUAL|accessdate = 2008-07-12|last = [[Canadian Forces]]|authorlink = |year = 1998|month = May |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803015913/http://www.casaraontario.ca/~webmaster1/Manuals/NationalSARmanual_full_english.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-03}}</ref>

The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include [[mountain rescue]]; ground search and rescue, including the use of [[search and rescue dog]]s; [[urban search and rescue]] in cities; [[combat search and rescue]] on the battlefield and [[air-sea rescue]] over water.

==Definitions==
There are many different definitions of search and rescue, depending on the agency involved.

*[[Canadian Forces]]: "Search and Rescue comprises the search for, and provision of aid to, persons, ships or other craft which are, or are feared to be, in distress or imminent danger."<ref name="CF"/>

*[[United States Coast Guard]]: "The use of available resources to assist persons or property in potential or actual distress."<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/international/affairs/Publications/MMSCode/english/Chap9.htm USCG CHAPTER 9 SEARCH AND RESCUE]</ref>

*[[United States Defense Department]]: A search is "an operation normally coordinated by a Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) or rescue sub-center, using available personnel and facilities to locate persons in distress" and rescue is "an operation to retrieve persons in distress, provide for their initial medical or other needs, and deliver them to a place of safety."<ref name="DoD">{{cite web|url =http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-o/g-opr/nsarc/DOD%20Support%20to%20Civil%20SAR%203003.pdf|format=PDF|title = U.S. Department of Defense DIRECTIVE NUMBER 3003.01|accessdate = 2008-07-12|last = [[U.S. Department of Defense]]|authorlink = |year = 2006|month = January}}</ref>

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
One of the world's earliest well documented SAR efforts ensued following the 1656 wreck of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchant ship ''[[Vergulde Draeck]]'' off the west coast of [[Australia]].  Survivors sent for help, and in response three separate SAR missions were conducted, without success.<ref>Major, R. H. (editor) (1859) ''Early Voyages to Terra Australis, Now Called Australia'', The Hakluyt Society, London (2001 facsimile edition on Google Books)</ref>

In 1983, [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] with 269 occupants was shot down by a Soviet aircraft near [[Sakhalin Island|Sakhalin]]. The Soviets sent SAR helicopters and boats to Soviet waters, while a search and rescue operation was initiated by U.S., South Korean, and Japanese ships and aircraft in international waters, but no survivors were found.<ref>

==Types of search and rescue==

===Mountain rescue===
{{Main|Mountain rescue}}
[[File:Christopherus8 2.jpg|thumb|Rescue helicopter "Christophorus 8"]]
[[Image:Gebirgstrage02 Patient Seilsicherung-2.jpg|thumb|right|Rescue rope training]]

Mountain rescue relates to search and rescue operations specifically in rugged and mountainous terrain.

===Ground search and rescue===
Ground search and rescue is the search for persons who are lost or in distress on land or inland waterways. Traditionally associated with wilderness zones, ground search and rescue services are increasingly required in urban and suburban areas to locate persons with [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[autism]], [[dementia]], or other conditions that lead to wandering behaviour.<ref name="Barry1999">{{cite web|url = http://www.dbs-sar.com/SAR_Research/Barry.htm|title = Alzheimer's Wanders Stir Concerns|accessdate = 2010-01-11|last = Barry|first = Ellen|authorlink = |year = 1999|month = December}}</ref> Ground search and rescue missions that occur in urban areas should not be confused with "Urban SAR", which in many jurisdictions refers to the location and extraction of people from collapsed buildings or other entrapments.<ref name="FEMAUSR">{{cite web|url = http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/|title = Urban Search and Rescue (US&R)|accessdate = 2010-01-11|last = U.S. Department of Homeland Security|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}</ref>

Some ground search teams also employ [[search and rescue dog]]s.

===Urban search and rescue===

{{Main|Urban search and rescue}}

Urban search and rescue (US&R or USAR), also referred to as Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR), is the location and rescue of persons from collapsed buildings or other urban and industrial entrapments. Due to the specialized nature of the work, most teams are multi-disciplinary and include personnel from police, fire and emergency medical services. Unlike traditional ground search and rescue workers, most US&R responders also have basic training in structural collapse and the dangers associated with live electrical wires, broken natural gas lines and other hazards. While [[earthquake]]s have traditionally been the cause of US&R operations, [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] and extreme weather such as [[tornado]]es and [[hurricane]]s have also resulted in the deployment of these resources.<ref name="FEMAAboutUSR">{{cite web|url = http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/about.shtm|title = About US&R|accessdate = 2010-01-11|last = U.S. Department of Homeland Security|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}</ref>

===Combat search and rescue===

{{Main|Combat search and rescue}}

Combat search and rescue (CSAR) is search and rescue operations that are carried out during war that are within or near combat zones.<ref name="ArmyTech">{{cite web|url = http://www.army-technology.com/glossary/combat-search-and-rescue.html|title = Term: Combat Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2009-06-03|last = SPG Media Limited/Army-Technology.com|authorlink = |year = 2009}}</ref>

===Air-sea rescue===

Air-sea rescue (ASR) refers to the combined use of aircraft (such as [[flying boat]]s, [[floatplane]]s, [[amphibious helicopter]]s and non-amphibious helicopters equipped with hoists) and surface vessels to search for and recover survivors of aircraft downed at sea as well as sailors and passengers of sea vessels in distress.<ref name=Algeo>Algeo, John. ''Fifty years among the new words: a dictionary of neologisms, 1941–1991'', pp. 39, 106–107. Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN 0-521-44971-5</ref>

==International divisions of search and rescue responsibility==

===International waters===
International waters are divided into various regions according to the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]] convention.<ref>See the map provided by the [http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/issues/emergencies/gmdss_sar/SARMAP.PDF IMO ocean atlas]</ref> In the [[Arctic]], SAR responsibilities are since May 2011 governed by the [[Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement]].

===United Nations===
[[International Search and Rescue Advisory Group]] (INSARAG) is a UN Organization that promotes the exchange of information between national Urban Search and Rescue Organizations.

==SAR by nation==

===Australia===

* '''National'''
The Australian search and rescue service is provided by [[AusSAR]], which is part of the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] (AMSA).<ref name="AusSAR">{{cite web|url = http://www.amsa.gov.au/Search_and_Rescue/|title = Search & Rescue|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Australian Maritime Safety Authority|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}</ref>

AusSAR operates a 24 hour Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in [[Canberra]] and is responsible for the national coordination of both maritime and aviation search and rescue. AusSAR is also responsible for the management and operation of the Australian ground segment of the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] distress beacon detection system. AusSAR's jurisdiction spans Australia and as well as covering 52.8 million square kilometres of the Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans.<ref name="AusSAR"/>

AusSAR's RCC is staffed by SAR specialists who have a naval, [[merchant marine]], air force, [[civil aviation]] or police service background. The RCC also coordinates medical evacuations, broadcasts maritime safety information and operates the Australian Ship Reporting System (AUSREP).<ref name="AusSAR"/>

In coordinating search and rescue missions, AusSAR will call on assistance from organisations as appropriate,<ref>The first suggestion made to use helicopters in Australian searches for missing people, sea rescues, and general support during bush-fires, floods, etc. was made in a letter to the editor, written from the Brisbane suburb of [[Balmoral, Queensland|Balmoral]], and published in the Brisbane ''Courier-Mail'' at the end of 1953 ([http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/51094737 Value of Helicopter, (Letter to the Editor, from "Wake Up, Australia"), ''Courier Mail'', (Thursday, 31 December 1953), p.2.])</ref> such as the Defence forces, [[Border Protection Command]], trained aviation organisations (Civil SAR Units), emergency medical helicopters, state Police services and trained Air Observers from the [[State Emergency Service]].<ref name="SA-SES_AirObs">{{cite web|url = http://www.ses.sa.gov.au/site/about_us/what_ses_does/air_search_observation.jsp|title = Air Search Observation}}</ref>

There are also other organisations, such as the non-profit [[Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service]] that is based at a number of sites around Australia.

* '''State'''
[[Image:BSAR searchers at Mount Dom Dom P3260158.JPG|thumb|right|BSAR searchers at [[Mount Dom Dom]]]]
[[State police|State Police]] in many states operate state-based search and rescue squads, such as the [[Victoria Police Search and Rescue Squad]], which provides specialist expertise, advice and practical assistance in land search and rescue on most terrain including snow and vertical cliff search and rescue.<ref name="VictoriaSAR">{{cite web|url = http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=174|title= Victoria Police Search and Rescue Squad| accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = State of Victoria|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = June}}</ref>

There are also state-based volunteer search and rescue groups such as the [[Bushwalkers Wilderness Rescue Squad]]<ref name="BWRSAus">{{cite web|url = http://www.bwrs.org.au/|title = A remote area search & rescue service for NSW|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Bushwalkers Wilderness Rescue Squad Inc|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = November}}</ref> in [[New South Wales]] and [[Bush Search and Rescue Victoria]]<ref name="BSARAus">{{cite web|url = http://www.bsar.org|title = Bush Search and Rescue Victoria|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Bush Search and Rescue Victoria|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = October}}</ref> in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. These state-based groups draw searchers from bushwalking, mountaineering and specialist rescue clubs within their State.  A few groups respond on horseback as [[mounted search and rescue]].

The [[State Emergency Service]] is a collection of volunteer-based emergency organisations established in each state or territory which are responsible for many rescue efforts in urban and rural areas and in any rescue that results from flood or storm activity. In rural areas the SES conducts most bush search, vertical and road traffic rescues. In urban areas they assist the police and fire services with USAR.<ref name="SESabout">{{cite web|url = http://www.ses.nsw.gov.au/about/|title = About the SES|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = State of New South Wales|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = December}}</ref>

Search and rescue duties in Canada are the responsibility of the [[Canadian Forces]] and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] in conjunction with provincial and municipal governments and private organizations. The Department of National Defence (DND) has overall responsibility for the coordinated search and rescue system. SAR operations are organized by Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC). The JRCC are manned 24 hours a day by SAR Co-ordinators from the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces. Authority for the provision of maritime SAR  is assigned to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans by the ''Canada Shipping Act'' and the ''Canada Oceans Act''.<ref name="CF" /> The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and other police forces also coordinate ground search and rescue (GSAR) operations, often using volunteer GSAR teams operating in specific districts under provincial coordinating bodies.<ref name="RCMPSAR">{{cite web|url = http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ccaps-spcca/rs-eng.htm|title = RCMP Search and Rescue|accessdate = 27 October 2010|last = [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]|authorlink = |year = 2006|month = December}}</ref>

SAR services in Denmark started in 1957 with seven [[Sikorsky H-19|Sikorsky S-55s]]. Their [[piston engine]]s produced only {{convert|550|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and they had limited fuel capacity, so their operational range was short. To increase the operational area, [[Percival Pembroke|Pembroke]] twin-engined fixed-wing aircraft were employed for search. These aircraft would localize the distressed person(s) and the S-55s would then rescue them. The SAR service was started for respond to fighter-plane crashes as 79 aircraft crashed, with 62 dead, in the period 1950-1955.,<ref name="DAFHIS">{{cite web|url = http://www.flv.dk/flyvevaabnet/historie_flyvevaabnet.htm|title = Flyvevåbnets historie|accessdate = 2008-07-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} {{da}}</ref> but civilian SAR duties are also conducted.

In 1962 eight ship-based [[Aérospatiale Alouette III]]s were received. These were primarily meant for the ships patrolling the North Atlantic, but also supported the S-55s. In 1964 - 1965 the seven S-55s were replaced with eight Sikorsky [[SH-3 Sea King|S-61A]] helicopters.<ref name="DAFS61">{{cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/NR/rdonlyres/C605235C-4851-457B-BFDA-75C3473573CF/0/HS61ASEAKING.pdf|format=PDF|title = Danish air force S-61A fact sheet|accessdate = 2008-07-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803015913/http://forsvaret.dk/NR/rdonlyres/C605235C-4851-457B-BFDA-75C3473573CF/0/HS61ASEAKING.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-03}} {{da}}</ref> This helicopter was originally designed for [[anti-submarine warfare]], but the Danish variant had the heavy dipping [[sonar]] equipment removed and extra fuel tanks added, giving the helicopters longer range. In 1977 [[radar]] was installed and in 1990 [[FLIR]] was added. Further [[avionics]] and navigation systems, including [[GPS]], have also been added over time.

In 1977 the naval air squadron was re-established as an independent squadron in the navy and had their Alouette IIIs replaced with [[Westland Lynx]] helicopters. Their primary operational area was still the North Atlantic, but they continued their support role, although this was reduced with the introduction of the S-61s. In 2006, the first of the S-61s was replaced by one of 14 new [[AgustaWestland AW101|AgustaWestland EH101 Merlin]] helicopters.

Maritime SAR is important because Denmark has a relative long coast line to its land mass.<ref name="DAPD1">{{cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/SOK/Nyt+og+Presse/2007-07-04.htm|title = Temadag om søredning og badesikkerhed|accessdate = 2008-07-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} {{da}}</ref><ref name="DAPD2">{{cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/FTK/Nyt+og+Presse/Billeder+fra+s%C3%B8redningsdagen+2007.htm|title = Pictures from the public display|accessdate = 2008-07-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2008 the SAR forces in Denmark were equipped with eight EH-101, one or two Lynx, 34 naval home guard vessels and 21 rescue vessels<ref name="DAPD1">{{cite web|url = http://www.fomfrv.dk/om_frv/hovedopgaver/kystredning.htm|title = Kystredning i Danmark|accessdate = 2008-07-09}} {{da}}</ref> as well as the naval vessels at sea. The EH-101s operate from bases in [[Aalborg Airport|Aalborg]], [[Skrydstrup]] and [[Roskilde Airport|Roskilde]]. When the sea water temperatures are low a helicopter is also deployed to the island of [[Bornholm Airport|Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Lynx operates from [[Karup Airport|Karup]]. Maritime vessels are spread out through the entire coastline and on islands. The S-61s and EH-101s have a crew of six: Two [[Aviator|pilots]], a [[navigator]], a [[flight engineer]], a [[physician]] and a [[Rescue swimmer#Denmark|rescue swimmer]].

The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|RNLAF]] has a specialized SAR unit, 303 Squadron, which is equipped with [[Agusta-Bell AB 412]]s and based at RNLAF Leeuwarden.

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]]'s Search and Rescue Region extends from the [[South Pole]] to the southern border of the [[Honolulu]] region, including Norfolk, Tonga, Samoa, and [[Cook Islands]].<ref name="NZAIP">{{cite web|url = http://www.aip.net.nz/|title = AIPA New Zealand GEN 3.6 Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = Civil Aviation Auithority of New Zealand|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref>

Smaller searches are controlled by the local [[New Zealand Police|police]], who call on LandSAR for land-based operations, such as for lost [[hiking|hikers]], and the [[Royal New Zealand Coastguard]] for coastal maritime incidents. Larger maritime search and rescue events, as well as reports of overdue aircraft, fall under the control of the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ), based in [[Avalon, New Zealand|Avalon]], which coordinates response from local coastguard, helicopter operators, merchant marine, [[New Zealand Air Force|air force]] and [[New Zealand Navy|naval]] resources.<ref name="NZAIP"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/About-us/RCCNZ-profile.asp|title=About our Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ)|month= | year=undated|publisher=Maritime New Zealand|accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref><ref name="NZRCCcontact">{{cite web|url = http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Commercial/Shipping-safety/Search-and-rescue/Contact-RCCNZ.asp|title = Contact RCCNZ|accessdate = 30 May 2010|last = Maritime New Zealand|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref>

[[Urban Search and Rescue]] falls primarily within the domain of the [[New Zealand Fire Service]], particularly the three USAR Taskforce groups based in Palmerston North, Christchurch, and Auckland. These teams draw together numerous specialists and organisations to achieve an integrated multi-agency response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.org.nz/About-Us/Our-Organisation/Pages/UrbanSearchandRescue.aspx |title=New Zealand Fire Service - Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) |publisher=Fire.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2012-04-08}}</ref>

Among those organisations that act in a support capacity for NZFS are Response Teams (NZRTs). These are regional rescue groups of professional volunteers that train to a minimum industry standard of USAR Category 1R (USAR Responder), which is also standard for NZFS firefighters. Response Teams are registered with the [[Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (New Zealand)|Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management]] (MCDEM), and assist their local MCDEM Groups and communities in emergencies to supplement full-time emergency services. Their additional capabilities, which vary among different teams, include: high angle rope rescue, storm response, swift water response, medics, welfare, and rural fire support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/memwebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/For-the-CDEM-Sector-NZ-Response-Teams-Index |title=The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management: NZ Response Teams |publisher=Civildefence.govt.nz |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2012-04-08}}</ref> Many Response Teams deployed to assist in the rescue and recovery effort of the [[2011 Christchurch Earthquake]].

===Norway===
[[Image:Biskop Hvoslef.jpg|thumb|The veteran Norwegian rescue ship [[Biskop Hvoslef]]]]
[[Norsk Selskab til Skibbrudnes Redning]], also called ''Redningsselskapet'' (English: Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue (NSSR)), is Norway's maritime rescue service. They have 43 search and rescue boats based from Oslo in the south to Båtsfjord in the north. Thirteen of these boats are operated by volunteers.<ref name="Redningsselskapet">{{cite web|url = http://www.nssr.no/|title = Redningsselskapet (in the Norwegian language)|accessdate = 2008-11-13|last = Redningsselskapet|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}</ref>

The NSSR was founded on 9 July 1891, with a clearly defined goal: to save lives at sea. The NSSR is a humanitarian organisation which aims to save lives and recover property at sea. It maintains rescue services along the Norwegian coast, and neighbouring sea areas where such services may be necessary. The NSSR also runs an information service and educational programs designed to improve safety for boaters. The first rescue boats, the [[Colin Archer]]-class, were introduced in 1893. They were powered by only by sails and oars. NSSR’s boats and crew have saved the lives of over 6,200 people. More than 500,000 people have received assistance.<ref name="Redningsselskapet" />

The search and rescue helicopters are operated by the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] (RNoAF), who fly 12 [[Westland Sea King]]s. The Norwegian Sea Kings are due to be replaced by 2020.<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/kampanjer/helicopters/about-the-project.html?id=495661 The NAWSARH Project]</ref>

===Portugal===
Three different agencies are responsible for providing search and rescue in [[Portugal]]. The [[Portuguese Navy]] is responsible for all sea rescues, the [[Portuguese Air Force]]<ref>[http://www.emfa.pt/ Portuguese Air Force]</ref> for all the rescues originating within the airspace, including aircraft crashes and the [[Autoridade Nacional de Protecção Civil]] (ANPC) for all inland rescues. All of the above coordinate closely with each other providing a comprehensive search and rescue service.

[[Image:Portuguese Search and Rescue Area.gif|thumb|200px|Portuguese Search and Rescue Area]]

The Portuguese area of responsibility is the second largest in the world, only to Canada's. It compromises the Lisbon [[Flight Information Region]] (FIR) and Santa Maria FIR.<ref>[http://www.portugal-vacc.org/lppo/index.php The Santa Maria FIR]</ref>

===Poland===
[[Image:W-3 RM Anakonda 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Navy]] [[PZL W-3 Sokół|W-3 Sokół]] SAR helicopter hoists a crew member]]
In Poland most search and rescue operations are undertaken by the airborne units of the [[Polish Armed Forces]]. The Navy currently has the largest SAR fleet of helicopters and also operates a number of small vessels for the purpose of rescuing crewmen of stricken ships. There is also, however a semi-governmental organisation known as the 'Morska Służba Poszukiwania i Ratownictwa' (''Maritime Search and Rescue Service'')<ref>[http://www.sar.gov.pl/ Polish Maritime Search and Rescue Service]</ref> which provides the vast majority of seaborne services to vessels in distress; the service is currently (as of 2010) in the process of overhauling and replacing a large portion of its fleet of [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s.

===South Africa===
Search and Rescue services are offered by various government departments, non governmental organizations, commercial/private organizations and voluntary organizations organisations in South Africa. There is no single organisation responsible for urban, wilderness, swift water, aviation or maritime/sea rescue.

Aviation and maritime incidents are the responsibility of the South African Search and Rescue Organization (SASAR). SASAR is a voluntary organization that functions under the auspices of the Department of Transport. Its main role is to search for, assist and carry out rescue operations for the survivors of aircraft or vessel accidents. Depending on the nature of the accident, the RCC's (ARCC or MRCC) coordinate the search and rescue missions. These operations are carried out by other government departments, non governmental organizations, commercial/private organizations and voluntary organizations.<ref name="SASAR">{{cite web|url = http://www.sasar.gov.za/|title = Who are we?|accessdate = 2008-11-13|last = SASAR|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref>

The society operates 66 search and rescue stations and over 160 ships manned by about 1800 volunteers. of those 1800, more than 300 are on call at any time, and can respond within 15 minutes. In 2011, the volunteers turned out to an emergency 3274 times. The [[Swedish Sea Rescue Society]] does about 70% of all SAR work in Swedish waters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sjoraddning.se/detta-gor-vi/ |title = Vi räddar liv till sjöss | accessdate = 9 March 2012 }}</ref>

[[Rega (air rescue)|REGA]] (Schweizerische '''RE'''ttungsflugwacht / '''G'''arde '''A'''érienne / '''G'''uardia '''A'''erea) is the air rescue service which provides emergency medical assistance in [[Switzerland]], notably in mountains but also in cases of life-threatening emergencies elsewhere. They will also return a citizen to Switzerland from a foreign country if they are in need of urgent medical care. Rega was established on 27 April 1952 by Dr. Rudolf Bucher, who thought that the Swiss rescue organisation needed a specialised air sub-section.<ref>[http://www.rega.ch/en/start_en.aspx REGA official website]</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], maritime search and rescue is coordinated by the Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA) while aeronautical rescue is delegated through the UK Ministry of Defence to the Royal Air Force, and land-based operations are usually coordinated by the local [[Policing in the United Kingdom|Police]] force. The operation itself is carried out with aircraft from the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] or Coastguard, [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]] [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s and police, military or volunteer [[mountain rescue]] or [[ALSAR]] (Association of Lowland Search and Rescue) teams. Aeronautical rescue and associated aircraft coordination is carried out by the UK Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre ([[ARCC]]) based at [[RAF Kinloss]] in the north of Scotland. The centre is responsible for tasking and coordinating all of the UK's search and rescue helicopter and RAF mountain rescue teams.<ref name="kinlossrescue">{{cite web|url = http://www.kinlossrescue.com|title = Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = ARCC Kinloss |authorlink = |year = 2005}}</ref><ref name="RNLIUK">{{cite web|url = http://www.rnli.org.uk/|title = Royal National Lifeboat Institution|accessdate = 2009-11-06|last = [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]]|authorlink = |year = 2009}}</ref>
 
In 2006, the government announced controversial plans to effectively [[privatise]] provision of search and rescue helicopters in order to replace the aging [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]]s currently in use, although they have suggested that crews may, at least partially, still be made up of [[Soldier|military personnel]].<ref name="BBC09May06">{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4753961.stm|title = Private bids plan for air rescue|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = BBC|authorlink = |month = May | date=2006-05-09|work=BBC News}}</ref> In February 2010, [[Soteria SAR]] was announced as the '' preferred bidder'' for the UK SAR programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soteriasar.com/news-article/mod-and-mcadft-selects-soteria-for-sar-h-programme|title=Press Release|date=9 Feb 2010|publisher=Soteria SAR|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> On 8 February 2011, after more controversy, Soteria was disallowed the contract due to irregularities regarding the conduct of their bid team,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-theroleofhmcoasguard/dops_-_sar_helo_harmonisation.htm |title=Search and Rescue (Helicopter) Project |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref> and a spending review carried out by the new Conservative Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/uk-government-suspends-sar-h-helicopter-/ |title=UK Government suspends SAR-H helicopter programme - News - Shephard |publisher=Shephardmedia.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref> The program, [[SAR-H]], was re-opened for bids on 28 November 2011.

In the United States there are many organizations with SAR responsibilities at the national, state and local level.

In January 2008, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) released the [[National Response Framework]] which, serves as the guiding document for a federal response during a national emergency.  Search and Rescue is divided into 4 primary elements, while assigning a federal agency with the lead role for each of the 4 elements.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf-annexes-all.pdf, Section ESF #9-1]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

In the U.S., SAR standards are developed primarily by [[ASTM International]] and the U.S. [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] which are then used by organizations such as the Mountain Rescue Association (MRA), the U.S. National Association of Search and Rescue (NASAR), and the NFPA to develop training that will meet or exceed those standards.<ref name="ASTM">{{cite web|url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/COMMIT/COMMITTEE/F32.htm?L+memberstore+ooef3203+1171348303|title = Committee F32 on Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = O'Toole|first = Thomas F.|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref> Within ASTM International, most standards of relevance to SAR are developed by Committee F32 on Search and Rescue. Formed in 1988, the committee had 85 current members and jurisdiction of 38 approved standards.<ref name="ASTM"/>

===Vietnam===
In [[Vietnam]], the National Committee of Search and Rescue is directly under the command of [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|Ministry of Defence]]. The National Committee of Search and Rescue is responsible for searching, rescueing and disaster relief.<ref>[http://www.vpa.org.vn/vn/regulations/tailieu/780-TTg.htm CỦA THỦ TƯỚNG CHÍNH PHỦ Số 780/TTg NGÀY 23 THÁNG 10 NĂM 1996 VỀ VIỆC THÀNH LẬP ỦY BAN QUỐC GIA TÌM KIẾM - CỨU NẠN TRÊN KHÔNG VÀ TRÊN BIỂN] (Vietnamese language)</ref>

In addition, the Vietnam Firefighting Force is another rescue force which is responsible for rescuing people during fires. The force is under command of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam)|Ministry of Public Security]].<ref>[http://pccc.canhsat.vn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222:t-chc-b-may-lc-lng-cnh-sat-phong-chay-va-cha-chay-&catid=90:t-chc-lc-lng&Itemid=297 Tổ chức bộ máy lực lượng Cảnh sát phòng cháy và chữa cháy] (Vietnamese language)]</ref>
