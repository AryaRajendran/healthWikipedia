'''Mosheh ben Maimon''' (משה בן מימון), called '''Moses Maimonides''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|aɪ|'|m|ɒ|n|ɪ|d|iː|z|}} {{Respell|my|MON|i-deez|}}) and also known as '''Mūsā ibn Maymūn''' ({{lang-ar|موسى بن ميمون}}), or  '''RaMBaM''' (רמב"ם – Hebrew acronym for "'''R'''abbi '''M'''osheh '''B'''en '''M'''aimon"), was a preeminent medieval [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]] and one of the most prolific and influential [[Torah]] scholars and physicians of the [[Middle Ages]]. He was born in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] (present-day [[Spain]]), [[Almoravid Empire]] on [[Passover Eve]], 1135, and died in [[Egypt]] on December 12, 1204.<ref>Davidson 2005, pp. 7–9, 18.  If the traditional birth date of 14 Nisan is not correct, then a date in 1136 is also possible. Location of his death is possibly Tiberias, where his son and [[Tomb of Maimonides|his tomb]] are set. There are several indications to the originality of the location, and traditions about the occasion of his death in Tiberias.</ref> He was a [[rabbi]], [[physician]], and [[philosopher]] in [[Morocco]] and [[Egypt]]. 

Although his writings on Jewish law and ethics were met with acclaim and gratitude from most Jews, even as far off as Iraq and Yemen, and he rose to be the revered head of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish community in Egypt]], there were also vociferous critics of some of his writings, particularly in Spain. Nevertheless, he was posthumously acknowledged to be one of the foremost rabbinical [[Posek|arbiters]] and philosophers in [[Jewish history]], his copious work comprising a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume [[Mishneh Torah]] still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of [[Talmud]]ic law. In the [[Yeshiva]] world he is known as "haNesher haGadol" (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a ''bona fide'' exponent of the [[Oral Torah]].

==Name==
His full Arabic name is Abū ʿImrān Mūsā bin Maimūn bin ʿUbaidallāh al-Qurṭubī ( ابو عمران موسى بن ميمون بن عبد الله القرطبي ) or Mūsā bin Maymūn ({{lang-ar|موسى ابن ميمون}}) for short. His full Hebrew name is Rabbi Mosheh ben Maimon ({{lang-he|רבי משה בן מימון}}), whose acronym forms "Rambam" (רמב"ם). In Latin, the Hebrew "ben" (son of) becomes the Greek−style suffix "-ides" to form "Moses Maimonides".

Maimonides was born in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] during what some scholars consider to be the end of the [[golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula]], after the first centuries of the [[Moors|Moorish]] rule. At an early age, he developed an interest in the exact sciences and philosophy. He read those [[Greek philosophers]] accessible in Arabic translations, and was deeply immersed in the sciences and learning of Islamic culture.<ref>Stroumsa,''Maimonides in his world: portrait of a Mediterranean thinker,'' Princeton University Press, 2009, p.65</ref> Though the [[Geonim|Gaonic]] tradition, especially in its North African version, formed the basis of his legal thought, some scholars have argued recently that [[fiqh|Muslim law]], including [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] legal thought, also had a substantial impact.<ref>Strousma, ''Maimonides in his world,'' pp.66–67</ref> Maimonides was not known as a supporter of [[Kabbalah|mysticism]], although a strong intellectualistic type of mysticism has been discerned in his philosophy.<ref>Abraham Heschel, ''Maimonides'' (New York: Farrar Strauss, 1982), Chapter 15, "Meditation on God," pp. 157–162.</ref> He voiced opposition to poetry, the best of which he declared as false, since it was founded on pure invention. This [[philosopher|sage]], who was revered for his saintly personality as well as for his writings, led an unquiet life, and wrote many of his works while travelling or in temporary accommodation.<ref name = "Americana 18 140">1954 ''Encyclopedia Americana'', vol. 18, p. 140.</ref> Maimonides [[Torah study|studied Torah]] under his father Maimon, who had in turn studied under Rabbi [[Joseph ibn Migash]] – a student of [[Isaac Alfasi]].

During the reign of [[Almoravids]], the position of the Jews was apparently free of significant abuses,<ref name=Stroumsa /> but after another [[Berber (etymology)|Berber]] dynasty, [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], conquered [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] in 1148 they abolished the [[dhimma]] status (i.e. state protection of life and wealth) in some of their territories. The loss of this protected status threatened the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jewish]] and Christian communities with the choice of [[Forced conversion#Islam|conversion to Islam]], [[martyrdom|death]], or [[exile]].<ref name = "Americana 18 140" /> However, the historical records of abuses against Jews in the immediate post-1148 period are subject to different interpretations.<ref name=Bennison>{{Cite journal| last = Bennison| first = A.K.| coauthors = M.A. Gallego García| title = Jewish Trading in Fez on the Eve of the Almohad Conquest| year = 2008| url=http://www.ugr.es/~estsemi/miscelanea/57/3.Gallego.08,33-51.pdf}}</ref> Many Jews were forced to convert, but due to suspicion by the authorities of fake conversions the new converts were also forced to wear identifying clothing.<ref name="EI2-Libas">{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 5| page = 744| first = Y.

During this time, he composed his acclaimed [[Bible commentary|commentary]] on the [[Mishnah]] in the years 1166–1168.<ref>Seder HaDoros (year 4927) quotes Maimonides as saying that he began writing his commentary on the Mishna when he was 23 years old, and published it when he was 30. Because of the dispute about the date of Maimonides's birth it is not clear which year it was actually published</ref>

Following this sojourn in Morocco, together with two sons,<ref>Herbert Alan Davidson
''Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works,'' OUP 2005 p.29.</ref> he sojourned in the [[Holy Land (Biblical)|Holy Land]], before settling in [[Fustat|Fostat]], Egypt around 1168. While in Cairo he studied in [[Yeshiva]] attached to a small [[Maimonides Synagogue|synagogue that bears his name]].<ref name=S.D.>[[S.D. Goitein|Goitein, S.D.]] ''Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders''. Princeton University Press, 1973 (ISBN 0-691-05212-3), p. 208</ref> In the Holy Land, he prayed at the [[Temple Mount]]. He wrote that this day of visiting the Temple Mount was a day of holiness for himself and his descendants. Maimonides shortly thereafter became instrumental in helping rescue Jews taken captive during the Christian [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric]]'s siege of the Egyptian town of [[Bilbays]]. He sent five letters to the Jewish communities of Lower Egypt asking them to pool money together to pay the ransom. The money was collected and then given to two judges sent to Palestine to negotiate with the Crusaders. The captives were eventually released.<ref>Cohen, Mark R. ''Poverty and Charity in the Jewish Community of Medieval Egypt.'' Princeton University Press, 2005 (ISBN 0-691-09272-9), pp. 115–116</ref> Following this triumph the Maimonides family, hoping to increase their wealth, gave their savings to the youngest son David, a merchant. Maimonides directed him to procure goods only at the Sudanese port of [[‘Aydhab]]. After a long arduous trip through the desert, however, David was unimpressed by the goods on offer there, and, against his brother's wishes, boarded a ship for India since great wealth was to be found in the East.<ref>The "India Trade" (a term devised by the Arabist S.D. Goitein) was a highly lucrative business venture where Jewish merchants from Egypt, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East would import and export goods ranging from pepper to brass from various ports along the [[Malabar Coast]] between the 11th–13th centuries. For more info, see the "India Traders" chapter in Goitein, ''Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders,'' 1973 or Goitein, ''India Traders of the Middle Ages,'' 2008.</ref> Before he could reach his destination though, David drowned at sea sometime between 1169–1170. The death of his brother caused Maimonides to become sick with grief. In a letter discovered in the [[Cairo Geniza]], he later explained:

{{quote|The greatest misfortune that has befallen me during my entire life—worse than anything else—was the demise of the saint, may his memory be blessed, who drowned in the Indian sea, carrying much money belonging to me, him, and to others, and left with me a little daughter and a widow.

About eight years have passed, but I am still mourning and unable to accept consolation. And how should I console myself? He grew up on my knees, he was my brother, [and] he was my student.<ref>Goitein, ''Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders,'' p. 207</ref>}}

Subsequently, he was appointed the ''[[Nagid]]'' of the Egyptian Jewish community around 1171.<ref name=S.D./> Arabist [[S.D. Goitein]] believes the leadership he displayed during the ransoming of the Crusader captives led to this appointment.<ref>Cohen, ''Poverty and Charity in the Jewish Community of Medieval Egypt,'' p. 115</ref> With the loss of the family funds tied up in David's business venture, Maimonides was constrained to assume the vocation of physician, for which he was to become famous, having been trained in medicine in both Córdoba and in Fes.

A philosopher by temperament and ideology, a zealous devotee of the contemplative life who eloquently portrayed and yearned for the serenity of solitude and the spiritual exuberance of meditation, he nevertheless led a relentlessly active life that regularly brouht him to the brink of exhaustion."</ref> In a famous letter, he describes his daily routine: After visiting the Sultan's palace, he would arrive home exhausted and hungry, where "I would find the antechambers filled with gentiles and Jews ... I would go to heal them, and write prescriptions for their illnesses ... until the evening ... and I would be extremely weak."<ref>''Responsa Pe’er HaDor'', 143.</ref> As he goes on to say in this letter, even on the Sabbath he would receive members of the community. It is remarkable that despite all this he managed to fit in the composition of massive treatises, including not only medical and other scientific studies but some of the most systematically thought-through and influential treatises on halachah (Rabbinic law) and Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages.<ref>Such views of his works are found in almost all scholarly studies of the man and his significance.  See, for example, the "Introduction" sub-chapter by Howard Kreisel to his overview article "Moses Maimonides," in ''History of Jewish Philosophy'', edited by Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman, Second Edition (New York and London: Routledge, 2003), pp. 245–246.</ref>  It has even been suggested that his "incessant travail" undermined his own health and brought about his death at 69.<ref>The comment on the effect of his "incessant travail" on his health is by Salo Baron, "Moses Maimonides," in Great Jewish Personalities in Ancient and Medieval Time, edited by Simon Noveck (B'nai B'rith Department of Adult Jewish Education, 1959), p. 227, where Baron also quotes from Maimonides' letter to Ibn Tibbon regarding his daily regime including on the Sabbath.</ref>  His Rabbinic writings are still fundamental and unparalleled resources for religious Jews today.

[[File:Keverambam.jpg|thumb|The [[Tomb of Maimonides]] in [[Tiberias]]]]
Maimonides died on December 12, 1204 (20th of [[Tevet]] 4965 ) in [[Fustat]], and it is widely believed that he was briefly buried in the study room ([[Beth midrash|beit hamidrash]]) of the synagogue courtyard, and that, soon after, in accordance with his wishes, his remains were exhumed and taken to [[Tiberias]] where he was re-interred.<ref>The Life of Maimonides [http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/v-exhibitions/rambam/eng/life.html jnul.huji.ac.il], Jewish National and University Library</ref> The [[Tomb of Maimonides]] on the western shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]] in [[Israel]] marks his grave. This location for his final resting-place is, however, not without controversy, for in the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish Cairene community]] a tradition holds that he remained buried in Egypt.<ref>[The End of the Exodus from Egypt [http://www.hsje.org/The%20end%20of%20the%20Exodus%20from%20Egypt.pdf hsje.org], HaAretz Daily Newspaper Israel: Amiram Barkat, April 21, 2005</ref>

Maimonides and his wife, the daughter of one Mishael ben Yeshayahu Halevi, had one child that survived into adult hood,<ref>אגרות הרמב"ם מהדורת שילת</ref> [[Avraham son of Rambam|Avraham]], who was recognized as a great scholar, and who succeeded him as Nagid and as court [[physician]] at the age of eighteen. He greatly honored the memory of his father, and throughout his career defended his father's writings against all critics.  The office of Nagid was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations until the end of the 14th century.

He is widely respected in Spain and a statue of him was erected in Córdoba in [[Córdoba Synagogue|the only synagogue]] in that city which escaped destruction; although no longer functioning as a Jewish house of worship, it is open to the public.

He is sometimes said to be a descendant of [[King David]], although he never made such a claim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Karesh|first=Sarah E.|title=Encyclopedia of Judaism|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0-8160-5457-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&pg=PA305&dq=Maimonides+descendant+%22king+david%22#v=onepage&q=Maimonides%20descendant%20%22king%20david%22&f=false|coauthors=Mitchell M.

Maimonides's Mishneh Torah is considered by traditionalist Jews even today as one of the chief authoritative codifications of Jewish law and ethics.  It is exceptional for its logical construction, concise and clear expression and extraordinary learning, so that it became a standard against which other later codifications were often measured.<ref>Isidore Twersky, ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, "Epilogue," pp. 515–538.</ref>  It is still closely studied in Rabbinic yeshivot (academies). A popular medieval saying that also served as his [[epitaph]] states, ''From [[Moses|Mosheh]] (of the Torah) to Mosheh (Maimonides) there was none like Mosheh.''  It chiefly referred to his Rabbinic writings.

But Maimonides was also one of the most influential figures in medieval Jewish philosophy.  His brilliant adaptation of Aristotelian thought to Biblical faith deeply impressed later Jewish thinkers, and had an unexpected immediate historical impact.<ref>This is covered in all histories of the Jews.  E.g., see even such a brief overview as Cecil Roth, ''A History of the Jews'', Revised Edition (New York: Schocken, 1970), pp. 175–179.</ref>  Some more acculturated Jews in the century that followed his death, particularly in Spain, sought to apply Maimonides's Aristotelianism in ways that undercut traditionalist belief and observance, giving rise to an intellectual controversy in Spanish and southern French Jewish circles.<ref>D.J. Silver, ''Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180–1240'' (Leiden: Brill, 1965), is still the most detailed account.</ref>  The intensity of debate spurred Catholic Church interventions against "heresy" and even a general confiscation of Rabbinic texts and in reaction, the defeat of the more radical interpretations of Maimonides and at least amongst Ashkenazi Jews, a tendency not so much to repudiate as simply to ignore the specifically philosophical writings and to stress instead the Rabbinic and halachic writings; even these writings often included considerable philosophical chapters or discussions in support of halachic observance, as David Hartman observes Maimonides made clear "the traditional support for a philosophical understanding of God both in the Aggadah of Talmud and in the behavior of the hasid [the pious Jew]"<ref>David Hartman, ''Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1976), p. 98.</ref> and so Maimonidean thought continues to influence traditionally observant Jews.<ref>On the extensive philosophical aspects of Maimonides' halachic works, see in particular Isidore Twersky's ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980).  Twersky devotes a major portion of this authoritative study to the philosophical aspects of the Mishneh Torah itself.</ref><ref>The Maimunist or Maimonidean controversy is covered in all histories of Jewish philosophy and general histories of the Jews.  For an overview, with bibliographic references, see Idit Dobbs-Weinstein, "The Maimonidean Controversy," in ''History of Jewish Philosophy'', Second Edition, edited by Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 331–349.  Also see Colette Sirat, ''A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 205–272.</ref>

The most rigorous medieval critique of Maimonides is [[Hasdai Crescas]]' ''[[Or Adonai]]''.  Crescas bucked the eclectic trend, by demolishing the certainty of the Aristotelian world-view, not only in religious matters but even in the most basic areas of medieval science (such as physics and geometry). Crescas's critique provoked a number of 15th century scholars to write defenses of Maimonides. A partial translation of Crescas was produced by [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]] of [[Harvard University]], in 1929.

Because of his path-finding synthesis of Aristotle and Biblical faith, Maimonides also had a fundamental influence on the great Church theologian [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite book

==The 13 principles of faith==<!-- This section is linked from [[Judaism]] -->
{{main|Jewish principles of faith}}

In his commentary on the Mishnah (tractate Sanhedrin, chapter 10), Maimonides formulates his "13 principles of faith". They summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism:
#The [[existence of God]]
#God's [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|unity]] and indivisibility into elements
#God's [[spirituality]] and [[incorporeal]]ity
#God's [[eternity]]
#[[God in Judaism#To God alone may one offer prayer|God alone]] should be the object of [[worship]]
#[[Revelation]] through God's [[prophet]]s
#The preeminence of [[Moses]] among the prophets
#The [[Torah]] that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by God
#The [[Torah]] given by Moses will not be replaced and that nothing may be added or removed from it
#God's awareness of human actions
#Reward of good and punishment of evil
#The coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]]
#The [[resurrection]] of the dead

Maimonides compiled the principles from various Talmudic sources. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbi [[Hasdai Crescas]] and Rabbi [[Joseph Albo]], and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community for the next few centuries. ("Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought," Menachem Kellner). However, these principles have become widely held; today, [[Orthodox Judaism]] holds these beliefs to be obligatory.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Two poetic restatements of these principles (''[[Ani Ma'amin]]'' and ''[[Yigdal]]'') eventually became canonized in the "[[Siddur]]" (Jewish prayer book).

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mishna tora44.jpg|thumb|A recent newly corrected version of [[Mishneh Torah]], Maimonides's main work of Halakha {{pufc|Mishna tora44.jpg|date=12 May 2011}} ]] -->
{{main|Mishneh Torah}}
With ''Mishneh Torah'', Maimonides composed a code of [[Jewish law]] with the widest-possible scope and depth. The work gathers all the binding laws from the [[Talmud]], and incorporates the positions of the [[Geonim]] (post-Talmudic early Medieval scholars, mainly from [[Mesopotamia]]).

While ''Mishneh Torah'' is now considered the fore-runner of the [[Arbaah Turim]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (two later codes), it met initially with much opposition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} There were two main reasons for this opposition. Firstly, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; secondly, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to "cut out" study of the Talmud,<ref>Last section of Maimonides's Introduction to Mishneh Torah</ref> to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law, although Maimonides himself later wrote that this was not his intent. His most forceful opponents were the rabbis of [[Provence]] (Southern France), and a running critique by Rabbi [[Abraham ben David]] (Raavad III) is printed in virtually all editions of Mishneh Torah.  However, it was recognized as a monumental contribution to the systemized writing of [[Halakha]].  Throughout the centuries, it has been widely studied and its halakhic decisions have weighed heavily in later rulings.

In response to those who would attempt to force followers of Maimonides and his ''Mishneh Torah'' to abide by the rulings of his own [[Shulchan Aruch]] or other later works, Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] wrote: "Who would dare force communities who follow the Rambam to follow any other decisor, early or late? ... The Rambam is the greatest of the decisors, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabistan]] and the [[Maghreb]] practice according to his word, and accepted him as their rabbi."<ref>{{PDFLink|1=[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=636&pgnum=70 Avkat Rochel ch. 32]}}</ref>

An oft-cited legal maxim from his pen is: "[[Blackstone's formulation|It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death]]."  He argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely according to the judge's caprice.<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg.

Scholars specializing in the study of the history and subculture of Judaism in premodern China (Sino-Judaica) have noted this work has surprising similarities with the liturgy of the [[Kaifeng Jews]], descendants of Persian Merchants who settled in the Middle Kingdom during the early [[Song Dynasty]].<ref>Leslie, Donald.

{{quote|There is no proof, to be sure, that Kaifeng Jewry ever had direct access to the works of "the Great Eagle," but it would have had ample time and opportunity to acquire or become acquainted with them well before its reservoir of Jewish learning began to run out. Nor do the Maimonidean leanings of the ''kehillah'' contradict the historical evidence that has the Jews arriving in [[Kaifeng]] no later than 1126, the year in which [[Jingkang Incident|the Sung fled the city]]--and nine years before Maimonides was born. In 1163, when the ''kehillah'' built the first of its synagogues, Maimonides was only twenty-eight years old, so that it is highly unlikely that even his earliest authoritative teachings could by then have reached China.<ref>Pollak, ''Mandarins, Jews, and Missionaries,'' pp. 297–298</ref>}}

===Charity (Tzedakah)===
One of the most widely referred to sections of the ''Mishneh Torah'' is the section dealing with [[Tzedakah]]. In Hilkhot Matanot Aniyim (Laws about Giving to Poor People), Chapter 10:7–14, Maimonides lists his famous Eight Levels of Giving (where the first level is most preferable, and the eighth the least):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dannysiegel.com/maimonides_8_degrees.pdf |title=Hebrew Source of Maimonides' Levels of Giving with Danny Siegel's translation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>

#Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need; so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.
#Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person (or public fund) which is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion.
#Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient.
#Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient.
#Giving tzedakah before being asked.
#Giving adequately after being asked.
#Giving willingly, but inadequately.
#Giving "in sadness" (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say "Giving unwillingly."

==Philosophy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}

Through the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' ( which was initially written in Arabic as ''Delalatul Ha'yreen'')   and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers, especially on [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], Thomas Aquinas and [[Duns Scotus]]. He was himself a Jewish Scholastic. Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of Aristotle. Maimonides strove to reconcile [[Wiktionary:Aristotelian|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy]] and science with the teachings of the [[Bible|Torah]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=The Guide to the Perplexed|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3963/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> He was also influenced by [[Asaph ha-Jehoudi]], who was the first [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] medical writer.

===Negative theology===
The principle which inspired his philosophical activity was identical with the fundamental tenet of Scholasticism: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy. Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of Aristotle and the teachings of the Talmud, commonly finding basis in the former for the latter. In some important points, however, he departed from the teaching of Aristotle; for instance, he rejected the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine that God's provident care extends only to humanity, and not to the individual.

Maimonides was led by his admiration for the [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] commentators to maintain many doctrines which the Scholastics could not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of "[[negative theology]]" (also known as "Apophatic theology".) In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes. For instance, one should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; all we can safely say is that God is not non-existent. We should not say that "God is wise"; but we can say that "God is not ignorant," i.e. in some way, God has some properties of knowledge. We should not say that "God is One," but we can state that "there is no multiplicity in God's being." In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of God by describing what God is not; rather than by describing what God "is".

The Scholastics agreed with him that no predicate is adequate to express the nature of God; but they did not go so far as to say that no term can be applied to God in the affirmative sense. They admitted that while "eternal," "omnipotent," etc., as we apply them to God, are inadequate, at the same time we may say "God is eternal" etc., and need not stop, as Maimonides did, with the negative "God is not not-eternal," etc.  In essence what Maimonides wanted to express is that when people give God anthropomorphic qualities they do not explain anything more of what God is, because we cannot know anything of the essence of God.

Maimonides' use of apophatic theology is not unique to this time period or to Judaism. For example, [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Eastern Christian]] theologians, developed apophatic theology for Christianity nearly 900 years earlier. See [[Negative theology]] for uses in other religions.

===Prophecy===
He agrees with "the philosophers" in teaching that, man's intelligence being one in the series of intelligences emanating from God, the [[prophet]] must, by study and meditation, lift himself up to the degree of perfection required in the [[prophet]]ic state. But here, he invokes the authority of "the Law," which teaches that, after that perfection is reached, there is required the "free acts of God," before the man actually becomes a [[prophet]].

===The problem of evil===
Maimonides wrote on [[theodicy]] (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a God with the existence of evil). He took the premise that an omnipotent and good God exists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maimonides|first=Moses|title=The Guide to the Perplexed|year=2007|publisher=BN Publishers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|title=Moses Ben Maimon|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&letter=M&search=maimonides#ixzz1GVE5kJqV |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Pines|first=Shlomo|title=Maimonides (1135–1204)|journal=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006|volume=5|pages=647–654}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Twersky|first=Isadore|title=Maimonides, Moses|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2005|volume=8|pages=5613–5618}}</ref> In his [[Guide for the Perplexed]], Maimonides writes that all bad that exists within human beings are a matter of the individual’s attributes, but all of the merits of humanity are due to their general characteristics (Guide 3;8). He also writes that there are people who are guided by higher purpose and there are those who are guided by physicality and must strive to find the higher purpose with which to guide their actions. Maimonides explains [[evil]] by saying that one who created something by causing its opposite not to exist is not the same as creating something that exists. He applies this principle to evil saying that evil is merely the absence of good, so God didn’t create a thing called evil, rather God created good and evil is something that exists where good is absent (Guide 3;10). God therefore created only the good things and not the bad things – the bad things come secondarily. Maimonides also contests the common view that evil outweighs good in the world by saying that if you look at some individual cases this may be so, but if you look at the whole universe, good is significantly more common than evil (Guide 3;12). He reasons this because man is very lowly compared to the rest of the universe and that when people see mostly evil, they are focused only on themselves and not taking into account the entirety of the [[universe]] which is overwhelmingly good since it contains all of life and all of the heavens.  
 
Maimonides also believes that there are three types of evil in the world; evil caused by nature, evil that people bring upon others and evil brought upon oneself (Guide 3;12). The first type of evil Maimonides reconciles as being very rare but at the same time, necessary for the survival of the species – if man does not change and old generations do not die to make space for new generations, then man cannot exist in its ultimate form. Maimonides writes that the second type of evil is relatively rare and that humanity brings it upon itself. The third type of evil humans bring upon themselves and are the source of most of the ills of the world, they are mostly the result of people falling victim to their physical desires. To prevent the majority of evil which stems from harm we do to ourselves, we must learn how to ignore our bodily urges.

===Astrology===
Maimonides answered an inquiry concerning astrology, addressed to him from [[Marseille]]. He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he had studied astrology, and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. The supposition that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations is ridiculed by him; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose, and would make man a slave of destiny. (See also [[Jewish views of astrology]])

===True beliefs versus necessary beliefs===
In "[[Guide for the Perplexed]]" Book III, Chapter 28,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp164.htm |title=Guide for the Perplexed, on |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Maimonides explicitly draws a distinction between "true beliefs," which were beliefs about God that produced intellectual perfection, and "necessary beliefs," which were conducive to improving social order. Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about God in the latter class.  He uses as an example the notion that God becomes "angry" with people who do wrong.  In the view of Maimonides (taken from [[Avicenna]]) God does not actually become angry with people, as God has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe God does, so that they desist from sinning.

===Resurrection, acquired immortality, and the afterlife===
Maimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal [[active intellect]]; this is his interpretation of the ''noûs poietikós'' of Aristotelian philosophy. It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of God.

The knowledge of God is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature. This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with immortality. One who has attained a correct knowledge of God has reached a condition of existence, which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and even from death itself. Man, therefore is in a position not only to work out his own salvation and immortality.

The resemblance between this doctrine and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s doctrine of immortality is so striking as to warrant the hypothesis that there is a causal dependence of the latter on the earlier doctrine. The differences between the two [[Judaism|Jewish]] thinkers are, however, as remarkable as the resemblance. While Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things ''sub specie æternitatis'', Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the [[Torah]] and the rabbinic understanding of the [[oral law]].

Religious Jews not only believed in immortality in some spiritual sense, but most believed that there would at some point in the future be a messianic era, and a resurrection of the dead. This is the subject of [[Jewish eschatology]]. Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually ''not'' about the resurrection of dead bodies.  This prompted hostile criticism from the rabbis of his day, and sparked a controversy over his true views.

Rabbinic works usually refer to this afterlife as "[[Jewish eschatology|Olam Haba]]" (the World to Come).  Some [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic works]] use this phrase to refer to a messianic era, an era of history right here on Earth; in other rabbinic works this phrase refers to a purely spiritual realm.  It was during Maimonides's lifetime that this lack of agreement flared into a full-blown controversy, with Maimonides charged as a [[heresy|heretic]] by some [[Judaism|Jewish]] leaders.

Some Jews at this time taught that [[Judaism]] did not require a belief in the physical resurrection of the dead, as the afterlife would be a purely spiritual realm.  They used Maimonides's works on this subject to back up their position.  In return, their opponents claimed that this was outright heresy;  for them the afterlife was right here on Earth, where God would raise dead bodies from the grave so that the resurrected could live eternally. Maimonides was brought into this dispute by both sides, as the first group stated that his writings agreed with them, and the second group portrayed him as a heretic for writing that the afterlife is for the immaterial spirit alone. Eventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, the "''Ma'amar Tehiyyat Hametim''" "The Treatise on Resurrection."

Chapter two of the treatise on resurrection refers to those who believe that the world to come involves physically resurrected bodies. Maimonides refers to one with such beliefs, as being an "utter fool" whose belief is "folly".

:If one of the multitude refuses to believe [that angels are incorporeal] and prefers to believe that angels have bodies and even that they eat, since it is written (Genesis 18:8) 'they ate', or that those who exist in the World to Come will also have bodies—we won't hold it against him or consider him a heretic, and we will not distance ourselves from him.  May there not be many who profess this folly, and let us hope that he will go no farther than this in his folly and believe that the Creator is corporeal.

However, Maimonides also writes, that those who claimed that he altogether believed the verses of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] referring to the resurrection were only allegorical, were spreading falsehoods and "revolting" statements.  Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement, and that it is not permissible for a Jew to support anyone who believes differently. He cites [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:2 and 12:13 as definitive proofs of physical resurrection of the dead when they state "many of them that sleep in the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence" and "But you, go your way till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days."

While these two positions may be seen as in contradiction (non-corporeal eternal life, versus a bodily resurrection), Maimonides resolves them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general. In his view, God never violates the laws of nature. Rather, divine interaction is by way of [[angel]]s, whom Maimonides often regards to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms. [This is not always the case. In Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah Chaps. 2–4, Maimonides describes angels that are actually created beings.] Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world's order.<ref>Commentary on the Mishna, Avot 5:6</ref>

In this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again. In his discussion of the [[Jewish principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], the first five deal with knowledge of God, the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption. In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection. All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual.

He writes "It appears to us on the basis of these verses (Daniel 12:2,13) that those people who will return to those bodies will eat, drink, copulate, beget, and die after a very long life, like the lives of those who will live in the Days of the Messiah." Maimonides thus disassociated the resurrection of the dead from both the World to Come and the Messianic era.

In his time, many Jews believed that the physical resurrection was identical to the world to come; thus denial of a permanent and universal resurrection was considered tantamount to denying the words of the Talmudic sages. However, instead of denying the resurrection, or maintaining the current dogma, Maimonides posited a third way: That resurrection had nothing to do with the messianic era (here in this world) or with [[Jewish eschatology|Olam Haba]] (עולם הבא) (the purely spiritual afterlife). Rather, he considered resurrection to be a miracle that the book of Daniel predicted; thus at some point in time we could expect some instances of resurrection to occur temporarily, which would have no place in the final eternal life of the righteous.

===''The Oath of Maimonides''===
The ''[[Oath of Maimonides]]'' is a document about the medical calling and recited as a substitute for the ''[[Oath of Hippocrates]]''. The ''Oath'' is not to be confused with a more lengthy ''Prayer of Maimonides''. These documents may not have been written by Maimonides, but later.<ref name=frank/> The ''Prayer'' appeared first in print in 1793 and has been attributed to [[Marcus Herz]], a German physician, pupil of [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.dal.ca/kellogg/Bioethics/codes/maimonides.htm |title=Oath and Prayer of Maimonides |publisher=Library.dal.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>

==Maimonides and the Modernists==
Maimonides remains one of the most widely debated Jewish thinkers among modern scholars.  He has been adopted as a symbol and an intellectual hero by almost all major movements in modern Judaism, and has proven immensely important to philosophers such as [[Leo Strauss]]; and his views on the importance of [[humility]] have been taken up by modern [[humanism|humanist]] philosophers, such as [[Peter Singer]].  In academia, particularly within  the area of Jewish Studies, the teaching of Maimonides has been dominated by traditional, generally Orthodox scholars, who place a very strong emphasis on Maimonides as a rationalist. The result of this is many sides of Maimonides's thought, for example his opposition to anthropocentrism, have been obviated. There is some movement in postmodern circles, e.g. within the discourse of ecotheology, to claim Maimonides for other purposes{{cn|date=April 2013}}. Maimonides's reconciliation of the philosophical and the traditional has given his legacy an extremely diverse and dynamic quality.

==Works and bibliography==

===Judaic and philosophical works===
Maimonides composed works of Jewish scholarship, [[halakhah|rabbinic law]], philosophy, and medical texts. Most of Maimonides's works were written in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]. However, the ''Mishneh Torah'' was written in Hebrew. His Judaism texts were:
*''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'' (Hebrew ''Pirush Hamishnayot'', Arabic ''siraj''),  written in Judeo-Arabic. This text was one of the first commentaries of its kind; its introductory sections are widely quoted.
*''[[Sefer Hamitzvot]]'' (trans. ''The Book of Commandments'').
*Sefer Ha'shamad (letter of Martydom)
*''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', also known as ''Sefer Yad ha-Chazaka'', a comprehensive [[code of law|code]] of Jewish law;
*''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', a philosophical work harmonising and differentiating Aristotle's philosophy and Jewish theology. Written in Judeo-Arabic. The first translation of this work into Hebrew was done by [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]] in 1204.<ref name=WDL1/>
*''Teshuvot'', collected correspondence and [[responsa]], including a number of public letters (on resurrection and the [[afterlife]], on conversion to other faiths, and ''[[The Yemen Epistle|Iggereth Teiman]]'' – addressed to the oppressed Jewry of [[Yemen]]).
*''Treatise on Logic''  (Arabic: ''Maqala Fi-Sinat Al-Mantiq'') has been printed 17 times, including editions in [[Latin]] (1527), [[German language|German]] (1805, 1822, 1833, 1828), [[French language|French]] (1935), and English (1938), and in an abridged Hebrew form.
*''Hilkhot ha-Yerushalmi'', a fragment of a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud, identified and published by [[Saul Lieberman]] in 1947.

===Medical works===
Maimonides wrote ten known medical works in [[Arabic]] that  have been translated by the  [[Jewish medical ethics|Jewish medical ethicist]] [[Fred Rosner]] into contemporary English.<ref name=rosner/>

*''Extracts from Galen'', or ''The Art of Cure'', is essentially an extract of [[Galen]]'s extensive writings.
*''Commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates'' is interspersed with his own views.
*''Medical Aphorisms of Moses'' titled ''Fusul Musa'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ("Chapters of Moses," ''Pirkei Moshe'' in Hebrew) contains 1500 aphorisms and  many medical conditions are described.
*''Treatise on Hemorrhoids'' discusses also digestion and food.
*''Treatise on Cohabitation'' contains recipes as [[aphrodisiac]]s and anti-aphrodisiacs.
*''Treatise on Asthma'' discusses climates and diets and their effect on asthma and emphasizes the need for clean air.
*''Treatise on Poisons and Their Antidotes'' is an early [[toxicology]] textbook that remained popular for centuries.
*''Regimen of Health'' is a discourse on healthy living and the mind-body connection.
*''Discourse on the Explanation of Fits'' advocates healthy living and the avoidance of overabundance.
*''Glossary of Drug Names'' represents a [[pharmacopeia]] with 405 paragraphs with the names of drugs in Arabic, Greek, Syrian, Persian, Berber, and Spanish.

===Treatise on logic===
Until very recently, it was believed that Maimonides wrote a ''Treatise on logic'' (''Makalah fi-sina'at al-mantik'' in Arabic) in his twenties or even in his teen<ref>Abraham Heschel, ''Maimonides'' (New York: Farrar Strauss, 1982 p. 22 ("at sixteen")</ref> years. This is not the case. Maimonides was not the author at all.<ref>Davidson, Herbert A. ''Moses Maimonides: The Man and his Works'', (OUP 2005) 313 et seq.</ref> The work illustrates the essentials of Aristotelian logic to be found in the teachings of the great Arabic philosophers such as Avicenna and, above all, [[Al-Farabi]], "the Second Master" to employ Maimonides' words, the "First Master" being [[Aristotle]].  In his work devoted to the Treatise, Rémi Brague stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein.  This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Alfarabi's works on logic.  In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called ''The words of Logic'' which happily describe the matter of the work. The Pseudo-Maimonides explains to the honest man, the technical meaning of the words used by logicians. The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to. Although Pseudo-Maimonides starts from the lexical items and produces a sort of lexicon, the Treatise is an organised work in which the chapters succeed each other rationally.  Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions.  The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples.  At the end of each chapter, Pseudo-Maimonides carefully draws up the list of words studied.
