It is named after the eminent [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821-1902). However, the elements comprising Virchow's triad were neither proposed by Virchow, nor did he ever suggest a triad to describe the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis. In fact, it was decades following Virchow's death before a consensus was reached proposing that thrombosis is the result of alterations in blood flow, vascular endothelial injury, or alterations in the constitution of the blood. Still, the modern understanding of the factors leading to embolism are similar to the description provided by Virchow. Its nebulous origins notwithstanding, Virchow's triad remains a useful concept for clinicians and pathologists alike in understanding the contributors to thrombosis.<ref name="pmid18783400">{{cite journal

==The triad==
The triad consists of three components:

Rudolf Virchow elucidated the etiology of [[pulmonary embolism]], whereby [[thrombi]] occurring within the [[veins]], particularly those of the extremities, become dislodged and migrate to the pulmonary vasculature. He published his description in 1856 <ref>{{cite book

Although the concept of the triad is usually attributed to Virchow, he did not include endothelial injury in his description.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1223}}</ref> This has been attributed to a dispute Virchow had with [[Jean Cruveilhier]], who considered local trauma of primary importance in the development of pulmonary artery thrombosis.<ref name="urlVirchows triad revisited. - Free Online Library">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Virchow%27s+triad+revisited.(Letters+to+the+Editor)(Letter+to+the...-a0114134751
