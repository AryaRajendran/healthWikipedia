Outside the psychiatric definitions of graphomania and related conditions, the word is used more broadly to label the urge and need to write excessively, whether professional or not. [[Max Nordau]], in his attack to what he saw as [[degenerate art]], frequently used the term 'graphomania' to label the production of the artists he condemned (most notably [[Richard Wagner]]<ref>Nordau M., [[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|''Degeneration'']]: "We will take a closer view of the graphomaniac Wagner.. He displays in the general constitution of his mind ... all the signs of graphomania, namely, incoherence, fugitive ideation, and a tendency to idiotic punning." p171-2; London: Heinemann. 1895 [http://www.archive.org/details/degeneration035137mbp]</ref> or the French [[symbolist poets]] <ref>''Ibid.''</ref>)

According to [[Milan Kundera|Kundera]], graphomania is the groundless claim, sometimes being large-scale, of being a writer:

{{quote|
"The irresisitable proliferation of graphomania among politicians, taxi drivers, childbearers, lovers, murderers, thieves, prostitutes, officials, doctors, and patients shows me that everyone without exception bears a potential writer within him, so that the entire human species has good reason to go down the streets and shout: 'We are all writers!'"|[[Milan Kundera]]|[[The Book of Laughter and Forgetting]]<ref>1978</ref>
}}

Kundera's feeling about graphomania may be explained by the fact that such a [[pejorative]] meaning of graphomania is actually often used in Post-Soviet block to denote foolish, unprofessional and excessive writings (not only in the form of literature, but also science), while [[logorrhea]] as a noun (with its negative, pejorative meaning) is not as often used.<ref>Both Graphomania and Logorrhea have phonetically equal translations to Slavic languages.</ref>  The word "logophiliac" is used in a similar disparaging fashion by cognoscenti in the US.
