'''Adalimumab''' (HUMIRA, [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]]) is the third [[TNF inhibitor]], after [[infliximab]] and [[etanercept]], to be approved in the [[United States]].  Like infliximab and etanercept, adalimumab binds to [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα), preventing it from activating TNF receptors. Adalimumab was constructed from a fully human [[monoclonal antibody]], while infliximab is a mouse-human [[Chimera (protein)|chimeric]] antibody and etanercept is a [[TNF]] receptor-IgG [[fusion protein]]. TNFα inactivation has proven to be important in [[downregulation|downregulating]] the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reactions associated with [[autoimmune disease]]s. As of 2008 adalimumab has been approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], moderate to severe chronic [[psoriasis]] and [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]]. Although only approved for [[ulcerative colitis]] from late 2012 by the FDA in the disease's management, it has been used for several years in cases that have not responded to conventional treatment at standard dosing for Crohn's Disease.

However, because TNFα is part of the immune system that protects the body from infection, treatment with adalimumab may increase the risk of infections. 

HUMIRA ("Human Monoclonal Antibody in Rheumatoid Arthritis") is marketed in both preloaded 0.8 mL [[syringe]]s and also in preloaded [[autoinjector|pen device]]s (called Humira Pen), both [[injection (medicine)|injected subcutaneously]], typically by the patient at home. For subcutaneous injection, the injection sites should be rotated. If solution is discolored do not use. Individuals with latex allergies must take caution as the needle caps of the pre-filled syringe may contain latex.<sup>22</sup> It cannot be administered [[route of administration|orally]] because the [[digestive system]] would destroy the drug.

Adalimumab was the first fully human monoclonal antibody drug approved by the FDA. It was derived from [[phage display]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brekke OH , Sandlie I |title=Therapeutic antibodies for human diseases at the dawn of the twenty-first century |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |volume=2 |pages=52–62 |date=January 2003 |doi=10.1038/nrd984 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n1/full/nrd984.html |issue=1 |pmid=12509759}}</ref> and was discovered through a collaboration between [[BASF|BASF Bioresearch Corporation]] (Worcester, Massachusetts, a unit of BASF) and [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] as D2E7,<ref name=Kempeni99>{{cite journal |author=Kempeni J |date=January 1999 |title=Preliminary results of early clinical trials with the fully human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody D2E7 |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |volume=58 |issue=suppl 1 |pages=I70–2 |pmid=10577977 |doi=10.1136/ard.58.2008.i70 |url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/58/suppl_1/I70.full |pmc=1766582}}</ref> then further manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation and developed by BASF Knoll (BASF Pharma) and, ultimately, manufactured and marketed by [[Abbott Laboratories]] after the acquisition of BASF Pharma by Abbott.

In 2009, HUMIRA had over $5 billion in annual sales.,<ref name="abbott.com">http://www.abbott.com/static/content/microsite/annual_report/2006/humira.html</ref> whilst in 2012 the drug reached $4.3 billion of sales in the US alone,<ref>http://www.drugs.com/stats/top100/2012/sales</ref> achieving $9.3 billion in worldwide sales for that year.<ref>http://www.abbott.com/press-release/abbott-reports-fourthquarter-and-fullyear-2012-results.htm</ref>

==History==
Adalimumab was discovered as a result of the collaboration between BASF Bioresearch Corporation (Worcester, Massachusetts, a unit of [[BASF]]) and [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] which began in 1993.<ref>[http://www.cambridgeantibody.com/home/news_and_resources/news_archive/2003/cambridge_antibody_technology__humira] Cambridge Antibody Technology website</ref>

The drug candidate was discovered initially using CAT's phage display technology and named D2E7.<ref name=Kempeni99/> The key components of the drug were found by guiding the selection of human antibodies from phage display repertoires to a single epitope of an antigen TNF alpha.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jespers LS, Roberts A, Mahler SM, Winter G, Hoogenboom HR |title=Guiding the selection of human antibodies from phage display repertoires to a single epitope of an antigen |journal=Biotechnology (N.Y.) |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=899–903 |year=1994 |month=September |pmid=7521646 |doi=10.1038/nbt0994-899 }}</ref> The ultimate clinical candidate, D2E7, was created and manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation and taken through most of the drug development process by BASF Knoll, then further development, manufacturing and marketing by [[Abbott Laboratories]], after Abbott acquired the pharmaceutical arm of BASF Knoll.<ref>http://www2.basf.us/corporate/news2000/newsknoll_pharma_121500.html</ref>

On 2 January 2013, Abbott Laboratories separated into two independent companies, Abbott and AbbVie.<ref>http://www.abbott.com/press-release/abbott-completes-separation-of-researchbased-pharmaceuticals-business.htm</ref> As a result [[AbbVie]] are taking responsibility for the further development and marketing of Humira.<ref>http://www.abbvie.com/products/home.html</ref>

== Indication ==
Adalimumab, like its [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] inhibitor competitors, [[infliximab]] and [[etanercept]], has proven versatile in its effectiveness in treating several conditions.

=== Rheumatoid arthritis ===
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) in adults. It has also been shown to have efficacy in moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children 4 years of age and older, and is approved for use in the treatment of that condition. In RA it can be used alone or with methotrexate or similar medicines.

=== Psoriatic arthritis ===
Adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott Laboratories) is a  fully human TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and undergoing trials for use in treating other conditions, including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scheinfeld | first1 = N | title = Adalimumab (HUMIRA): a review | journal = J Drugs Dermatol | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12884458 }}</ref>

=== Ankylosing spondylitis ===
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of, and is approved for treatment of, [[ankylosing spondylitis]] (AS) in adults.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ankylosing Spondylitis|url=http://www.humira.com/as/default.aspx|work=Humira (adalimumab) drug information website|publisher=Abbott Laboratories|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>

=== Crohn’s disease ===

=== Ulcerative colitis ===
Adalimumab may be effective and well tolerated in [[Ulcerative colitis]]. Its efficacy in maintaining clinical remission needs to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fiorino G, Peyrin-Biroulet L, Repici A, Malesci A, Danese S |title=Adalimumab in ulcerative colitis: hypes and hopes |journal=Expert Opin Biol Ther |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=109–16 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21133817 |doi=10.1517/14712598.2011.541435 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14712598.2011.541435}}</ref>  It has been approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate-to-severe cases in adults.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm321650.htm |title=FDA approves Humira to treat ulcerative colitis |date=Sept. 28, 2012 |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

=== Plaque psoriasis ===
Adalimumab has been shown to treat moderate to severe chronic (lasting a long time) [[plaque psoriasis]] (Ps) in adults who have the condition in many areas of their body and who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or [[phototherapy]] (treatment using ultraviolet light alone or with pills).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Croom | first1 = Katherine F | last2 = McCormack | first2 = Paul L | title = Adalimumab | journal =Am J Clin Dermatol | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–50 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19170412 | doi = 10.2165/0128071-200910010-00008 }}</ref> Adalimumab has been shown to be effective therapy when used either continuously or intermittently in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

=== Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ===
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children four years of age and older. For patients 15&nbsp;kg (33&nbsp;lbs) to 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;lbs) administer 20&nbsp;mg subcutaneously every other week. For patients weighing more than 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;lbs) administer 40&nbsp;mg subcutaneously every other week.<sup>22</sup>

== Safety ==
[[File:Components of a Adalimumab-Humira pen - annotated.jpg|225px|thumbnail|Components of a Humira [[autoinjector]] pen. See file details for explanation of parts.]]
Because adalimumab suppresses [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]], which is part of the immune system, latent infections, such as tuberculosis, can be reactivated, and the immune system may be unable to fight new infections. This has led to fatal infections.<ref>Karen M. Frank, et al, Investigation of the cause of death in a gene-therapy trial, N Engl J Med 361:161, July 9, 2009</ref>

According to the product labeling, after a number of studies and reports of adverse events in patients receiving adalimumab, including serious and sometimes fatal blood disorders, serious [[infection]]s including [[tuberculosis]] (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria, rare reports of [[lymphoma]]<ref>http://www.fdable.com/advanced_aers_query/c92ac23d3e2c43d72f398360cda8ce5c</ref> and solid tissue [[cancer]]s, rare reports of serious [[liver]] injury, rare reports of [[demyelinating]] [[central nervous system]] disorders, rare reports of cardiac failure, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a [[black box warning]] to doctors which appears in the product labeling of adalimumab and the other [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] drugs instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully.<ref>FDA label - http://www.rxabbott.com/pdf/humira_medguide.pdf</ref> Anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions may occur.<sup>22</sup>

==Royalty litigation==
In March 2003, British company [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for HUMIRA" with [[Abbott Laboratories]] in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of [[London]]. In November 2004, the trial began, and in December 2004, the Judge, [[Hugh Laddie|The Hon. Mr Justice Laddie]], ruled for CAT. In an unusual step, a draft of the judgement was not made available in advance.

A short version of the full statement of the proceedings was released.<ref>http://www.chandb.com/MBE/assessment_041220_CaT_Abbott_judgement_summary.doc</ref> In it Justice Laddie remarked, "Abbott was in error when it made its first royalty payment to CAT calculated on the basis that only 2% of the Net Sales was due. It should have calculated on the basis of the full royalty of just over 5% and should have paid and continued to pay CAT accordingly." Justice Laddie went on to observe "...that the construction advanced by Abbott does violence to the language of the agreements, renders them obscure and makes little or no commercial sense. For this reason CAT wins the action."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4112235.stm | work=BBC News | title=Biotech firm wins royalty fight | date=2004-12-20 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2924694/Drug-maker-CAT-surges-after-royalty-settlement.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Drug maker CAT surges after royalty settlement | first=Rosie | last=Murray- | date=2005-10-27 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> Of this sum, the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that HUMIRA remains on the market. The MRC also is to receive a further £5.1M (sterling) in respect of past royalties.<ref>http://www.mrctechnology.org/resources/PR/MRC_Humira_PRESS_RELEASE.pdf</ref>

==Patent litigation==
On May 29, 2009, Johnson & Johnson's Centocor unit, the maker of Remicade, which is also a TNF inhibitor, won a ruling for $1.67 billion from Abbott Laboratories, the maker of Humira, for patent infringement on the process for making Humira.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ai9qZo._7.sw | work=Bloomberg | title=J&J Wins Record .67 Billion Verdict From Abbott (Update2) | date=30 June 2009}}</ref> However, this judgement was overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]].<ref>[www.patentlyo.com/files/10-1144.pdf] Centocor v.
