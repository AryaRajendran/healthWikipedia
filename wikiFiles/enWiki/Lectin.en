'''Lectins''' are carbohydrate-binding [[protein]]s (not to be confused with [[glycoprotein]]s, which are proteins containing sugar chains or residues) that are highly specific for sugar [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]], particularly, the high specificity of plant lectins for foreign glycoconjugates (e.g. those of fungi, invertebrates and animals).<ref>{{cite book |authors= Els.

The name "lectin" is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''legere'', meaning, among other things, "to select".(lek'tin)

==History==
Although they were first discovered more than 100 years ago in plants, lectins are now known to be present throughout nature. It is generally believed that the earliest description of a lectin was given by [[Peter Hermann Stillmark]] in his doctoral thesis presented in 1888 to the [[University of Dorpat]]. Stillmark isolated [[ricin]], an extremely toxic [[hemagglutinin]], from seeds of the [[Ricinus|castor plant (''Ricinus communis'')]].
The first lectin to be purified on a large scale and available on a commercial basis was [[concanavalin A]], which is now the most-used lectin for characterization and purification of sugar-containing molecules and cellular structures. The [[legume lectin]]s are probably the most well-studied lectins.

==Biological functions==
Most lectins do not possess enzymatic activity and are not produced naturally by the immune system. Lectins occur ubiquitously in nature. They may bind to a soluble carbohydrate or to a carbohydrate [[functional group|moiety]] that is a part of a [[glycoprotein]] or [[glycolipid]]. They typically [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]] certain animal cells and/or precipitate [[glycoconjugate]]s.

 [[File:gs4 sugar all.png|thumb|An [[oligosaccharide]] (shown in grey) bound in the binding site of a plant lectin (''[[Griffonia simplicifolia]]'' isolectin IV in complex with the Lewis b [[blood group]] determinant). Only a part of the oligosaccharide (central, in grey) is shown for clarity.]]

===Functions in animals===
Lectins serve many different biological functions in animals, from the regulation of [[cell adhesion]] to [[glycoprotein]] synthesis and the control of protein levels in the blood. They may also bind soluble extracellular and intercellular glycoproteins.
Some lectins are found on the surface of mammalian liver cells that specifically recognize [[galactose]] residues. It is believed that these cell-surface receptors are responsible for the removal of certain glycoproteins from the circulatory system.
Another lectin is a receptor that recognizes hydrolytic enzymes containing [[mannose-6-phosphate]], and targets these proteins for delivery to the [[lysosome]]s. [[I-cell disease]] is one type of defect in this particular system.
Lectins are also known to play important roles in the [[immune system]] by recognizing carbohydrates that are found exclusively on [[pathogen]]s, or that are inaccessible on host cells. Examples are the lectin [[mannan-binding lectin pathway|complement activation pathway]] and [[mannose-binding lectin]].

===Functions in plants===
[[File:Phytohemagglutinin L.png|thumb|left|Leucoagglutinin, a toxic [[phytohemagglutinin]] found in raw ''[[Vicia faba]]'']]
The function of lectins in plants ([[legume lectin]]) is still uncertain.  Once thought to be necessary for [[rhizobia]] binding, this proposed function was ruled out through lectin-knockout [[transgene]] studies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The large concentration of lectins in plant seeds decreases with growth, and suggests a role in plant [[germination]] and perhaps in the seed's survival itself.  The binding of [[glycoprotein]]s on the surface of parasitic cells is also believed to be a function. Several plant lectins have been found to recognise non-carbohydrate ligands that are primarily hydrophobic in nature, including adenine, auxins, cytokinin, and indole acetic acid, as well as water-soluble porphyrins. It has been suggested that these interactions may be physiologically relevant, since some of these molecules function as [[phytohormone]]s.<ref name="pmid16525538">{{cite journal | author = Komath SS, Kavitha M, Swamy MJ | title = Beyond carbohydrate binding: new directions in plant lectin research | journal = Org. Biomol.

Lectins are similar to antibodies in their ability to agglutinate red blood cells; however, lectins are not the product of immune system. The toxicity of lectins has been identified by consumption of food with high content of lectins, which can lead to diarrhea, nausea, bloating, vomiting, even death (as from ricin). Many legume seeds have been proven to contain high lectin activity, termed as hemagglutinating activity. Soybean is the most important grain legume crop, the seeds of which contain high activity of soybean lectins (soybean agglutinin or SBA). SBA is able to disrupt small intestinal metabolism and damage small intestinal villi via the ability of lectins to bind with [[brush border]] surfaces in the distal part of small intestine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Heat processing can reduce the toxicity of lectins, but low temperature or insufficient cooking may not completely eliminate their toxicity, as some plant lectins are resistant to heat. (It is believed that undercooking red kidney beans increases toxicity.)  In addition, lectins can result in irritation and over-secretion of mucus in the intestines, causing impaired absorptive capacity of the intestinal wall.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Use in science, medicine and technology==
===Use in medicine and medical research===
Purified lectins are important in a clinical setting because they are used for [[blood typing]].<ref>[http://glycob.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/11/53R.full  The History of Lectins by N.Sharon]</ref> Some of the glycolipids and glycoproteins on an individual's red blood cells can be identified by lectins.
* A lectin from ''[[Dolichos]] biflorus'' is used to identify cells that belong to the A1 blood group.
* A lectin from ''[[Ulex]] europaeus'' is used to identify the H blood group antigen.
* A lectin from ''[[Vicia]] graminea'' is used to identify the N blood group antigen.
* A lectin from [[coconut milk]] is used to identify Theros antigen.
* A lectin from '' Dorex'' is used to identify R antigen.
In neuroscience, the [[anterograde labeling method]] is used to trace the path of [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] [[axon]]s with [[PHA-L]], a lectin from the [[kidney bean]].<ref name="Carlson">{{cite book | author = Carlson, Neil R. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Physiology of behavior | edition = | language = | publisher = Pearson Allyn & Bacon | location = Boston | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-205-46724-5 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

A lectin ([[BanLec]]) from bananas inhibits [[HIV-1]] in vitro.<ref>http://www.jbc.org/content/285/12/8646.abstract "A Lectin Isolated from Bananas Is a Potent Inhibitor of HIV Replication" 2010</ref>
Achylectins, isolated from ''Tachypleus tridentatus'', show specific agglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes.  Anti-B agglutinins such as anti-BCJ and anti-BLD separated from ''Charybdis japonica'' and ''Lymantria dispar'', respectively, are of value both in routine blood grouping and research. <ref> http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/11250003.2010.492794 Prospect for lectins in arthropods 2010</ref>

===Use in studying carbohydrate recognition by proteins===
Lectins from legume plants, such as [[Phytohaemagglutinin|PHA]] or [[concanavalin A]], have been widely used as model systems to understand the molecular basis of how proteins recognize carbohydrates, because they are relatively easy to obtain and have a wide variety of sugar specificities. The many [[crystal structures]] of legume lectins have led to a detailed insight of the atomic interactions between carbohydrates and proteins.

===Use as a biochemical tool===
[[Concanavalin A]] and other commercially available lectins have been widely used in [[affinity chromatography]] for purifying glycoproteins.<ref>[http://www.gelifesciences.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/catalog/sv/GELifeSciences/products/AlternativeProductStructure_17334/]</ref>

In general, proteins may be characterized with respect to [[glycoform]]s and [[carbohydrate]] structure by means of [[affinity chromatography]], [[blotting]], [[affinity electrophoresis]] and [[immunoelectrophoresis|affinity immunoelectrophoreis]] with lectins as well as in [[microarray]]s, as in [[wikt:evanescent|evanescent]]-field fluorescence-assisted lectin microarray.<ref>[http://www.gpbio.jp/english/tech.html Glyco Station, Lec Chip, Glycan profiling technology]</ref>

===Use in biochemical warfare===
One example of the powerful biological attributes of lectins is the biochemical warfare agent [[ricin]]. The protein ricin is isolated from seeds of the [[castor oil plant]] and comprises two [[protein domains]]. [[Abrin]] from the [[Rosary pea|jequirity pea]] is similar:
* One domain is a lectin that binds cell surface galactosyl residues and enables the protein to enter cells
* The second domain is an N-[[glycosidase]] that cleaves nucleobases from ribosomal RNA, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death.

==Toxicity==
===Digestion and immune distress===
Foods with high concentrations of lectins, such as [[bean]]s, [[cereal grain]]s, [[seed]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, and [[potato]]es, may be harmful if consumed in excess in uncooked or improperly cooked form. Adverse effects may include [[nutritional deficiencies]], and [[immune reaction|immune]] ([[allergic reaction|allergic]]) reactions.<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=880100&fulltextType=RV&fileId=S0007114500000271# British Journal of Nutrition (2000), 83: 207-217 Cambridge University Press]</ref> Possibly, most effects of lectins are due to gastrointestinal distress through interaction of the lectins with the gut epithelial cells. A recent [[in vitro]] study has suggested that the mechanism of lectin damage may occur by interfering with the repair of already-damaged epithelial cells.<ref name="pmid17668065">{{cite journal | author = Miyake K, Tanaka T, McNeil PL | title = Lectin-Based Food Poisoning: A New Mechanism of Protein Toxicity | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = e687 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17668065 | pmc = 1933252 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000687 | url =  | editor1-last = Steinhardt | editor1-first = Richard }}</ref>

===Lectin and Leptin Resistance===

Lectin may cause [[leptin]] resistance, affecting its functions (signal have high levels of leptin and several effects gathering to protect from lipid overload), as indicated by studies on effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on the function of leptin and the leptin receptor.<ref>T Jönsson, S Olsson, B Ahrén , T C Bøg-Hansen, A Dole and S Lindeberg (2005). "Agrarian diet and diseases of affluence&nbsp;– Do evolutionary novel dietary lectins cause leptin resistance?". BioMed Central Ltd.. {{doi|10.1186/1472-6823-5-10}}. . http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6823/5/10.</ref>
Such leptin resistance may translate into diseases, notably it could be responsible for obesity in humans who have high levels of leptin.
