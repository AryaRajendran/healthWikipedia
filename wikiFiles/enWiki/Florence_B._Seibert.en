'''Florence B. Seibert''' (October 6, 1897 – August 23, 1991)<ref name=SSDI>{{cite web|title=Florence B. Seibert|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/PageDetail.aspx?recordId=72206999|work=Social Security Death Index|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[Biochemistry|biochemist]] known for isolating a pure form of [[tuberculin]] used in the standard [[tuberculosis|TB]] test. She is a member of the U.S. [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], Seibert is said to have read biographies of famous scientists as a teenager which inspired her interest in science. As a child she contracted [[polio]] which left her walking with a limp, though the disability did not interfere with her life or work.

Seibert did her undergraduate work at [[Goucher College]] and earned her [[Ph.D.]] in biochemistry from [[Yale University]]. At Yale she studied the [[intravenous]] [[medical injection|injection]] of milk [[proteins]] under the direction of [[Lafayette Mendel]]. She developed a method to prevent these proteins from being contaminated with [[bacteria]].

==Professional achievements and awards==
In 1923 Seibert worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the [[University of Chicago]]. She was financed by the Porter Fellowship of the [[American Philosophical Society]], an award that was competitive for both men and women.

Seibert served as an instructor in [[pathology]] from 1924-28 at the University of Chicago and was hired as an assistant professor in biochemistry in 1928. At the University of Chicaco she developed a method for purifying the [[crystal|crystalline]] tuberculin derivative under the supervision of Esmond R. Long.<ref name=CHF>{{cite web|title=Esmond R. Long and Florence B. Seibert|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/chemistry-in-history/themes/pharmaceuticals/diagnosing-diseases/long-and-seibert.aspx|work=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> This purified protein derivative (PPD) was used in the standard TB test. The previous tuberculin derivative, [[Robert Koch|Koch's]] substance, had produced false negative results in tuberculosis tests since the 1890s because of impurities in the material.

In 1932, she became assistant professor in biochemistry at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at the Henry Phipps Institute and rose through the ranks to full professor and professor emeritus in 1959, when she retired. After her retirement she did volunteer work for many years in [[cancer]] research. She died at the Palm Springs Nursing Home in St. Petersburg.<ref name=NYT/><br />
Siebert received the Trudeau Medal from the National Tuberculosis Association in 1938, the [[Garvan–Olin Medal|Francis P. Garvan Medal]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1942,<ref name=Garvan>{{cite web|title=Francis P. Garvan-John M. Olin Medal|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node_id=1319&content_id=CTP_004521&use_sec=true&sec_url_var=region1&__uuid=|work=American Chemical Society|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> and an induction to the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1990.
