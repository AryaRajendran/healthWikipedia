'''Specific developmental disorders''' are disorders in which development is delayed in one specific area or areas,<ref name = "Vyas">Ahuja Vyas: ''Textbook of Postgraduate Psychiatry'' (2 Vols.), 2nd ed. 1999</ref> and in which basically all other areas of development are not affected.<ref name = "MedicineNet">http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11249</ref> Specific developmental disorders are as opposed to [[pervasive developmental disorders]]<ref name = "MedicineNet" /> that are characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including [[socialization]] and [[communication]].<ref>http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/pdd/pdd.htm</ref>

==ICD-10 taxonomy==
The tenth revision of the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) has four categories of specific developmental disorder: specific developmental disorders of speech and language, specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and mixed specific developmental disorder.<ref>http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F80</ref>

==DSM taxonomy==
In the third edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-III),<ref>Dennis Cantwell & Lorian Baker: ''Developmental Speech and Language Disorders'', 1987, page 4</ref> SDD was opposed to the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). There were two factors that were considered:
* The specificity of the impairment: in SDD there is one single domain that is affected, whereas in PDD multiple areas of functioning are affected.<ref name = "Rutter">Sir Michael Rutter, Eric A. Taylor: ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'', 4th ed. 2005</ref> 
* The nature of the impairment: development in SDD is delayed but not otherwise abnormal, whereas in PDD there are behavioral deviations that are not typical for any developmental stage.<ref name = "Rutter" />
In the fourth edition of the DSM specific developmental disorders are no longer grouped together.<ref name = "Campbell">Robert Jean Campbell, III: ''Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary,'' 2003, page 184</ref> Instead they are reclassified as communication disorders, learning disorders, and motor skills disorders.<ref name = "Vyas" />
