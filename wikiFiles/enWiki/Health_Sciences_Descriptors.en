'''DeCS – Health Sciences Descriptors''' is a structured and trilingual [[thesaurus]] created by [[Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information|BIREME]] – [[Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information]] – in 1987 for [[Index (database)|indexing]] [[scientific journal]] articles, books, proceedings of congresses, technical reports and other types of materials, as well as for searching and recovering scientific information in LILACS, [[Medline|MEDLINE]] and other databases. In the [[Virtual Health Library|VHL]], [[Virtual Health Library]], DeCS is the tool that permits the navigation between [[Storage record|records]] and sources of information through controlled concepts and organized in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Spanish and English.

It was developed from [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] – [[Medical Subject Headings]] from the [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] – [[National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]] – in order to permit the use of common terminology for searching in three languages, providing a consistent and unique environment for [[information retrieval]] regardless of the language. In addition to the original MeSH terms,<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh Medical Subject Headings]</ref> four specific areas were developed: [[Public Health]] (1987), [[Homeopathy]] (1991), [[Clinical surveillance|Health Surveillance]] (2005), and Science and Health (2005).

The concepts that compose the DeCS vocabulary are organized in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical structure]] permitting searches in broader or more specific terms or all the terms that belong to a single hierarchy.  

Its main purpose is to serve as a unique language for indexing and recovery of information among the components of the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System,<ref>[http://metodologia.lilacs.bvs.br/php/level.php?lang=en&component=19&item=5 Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System]</ref> coordinated by BIREME and that encompasses 37 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, permitting a uniform dialog between nearly 600 libraries.  

DeCS participates in the unified terminology development project, [[Unified Medical Language System|UMLS]] – [[Unified Medical Language System]] of the NLM, with the responsibility of contributing with the terms in Portuguese and Spanish.<ref>[http://bvsmodelo.bvsalud.org/php/level.php?lang=en&component=27&item=1 Methodologies and Applications.
