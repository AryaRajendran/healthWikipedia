'''Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care''' (MC4) is a combat health support [[information management]] system of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].  

MC4 integrates, fields and supports medical (patient) information for tactical medical forces, enabling a comprehensive, lifelong electronic medical record for all Service members, as well as enhancing medical situational awareness for operational commanders. By accomplishing this mission, the MC4 Product Management Office (PMO) provides the U.S. Army’s solution to the Presidential and Congressional objectives set-forth by U.S. Code [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]] in 1997, which called for a medical tracking system for all deployed Service members.

== Software & Hardware ==
MC4 systems include ruggedized, cutting-edge hardware and joint, government software. 

MC4 PMO performs systems engineering and integration with the Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP), and key software developers, to ensure compatibility between software applications and reliable hardware devices. 

The data generated in MC4 is securely shared with higher levels of care, joint medical surveillance and data systems worldwide. MC4 PMO’s use of emerging technologies and software used by all military Services ensures each user is equipped with state-of-the-art system capabilities that transcend military stovepipe systems.   

The deployment of ruggedized hardware – including laptops, handhelds, printers and servers – guarantees deployable medical professionals receive durable technologies that long withstand harsh battlefield conditions.

== Training, Fielding & Support ==
MC4 PMO provides hands-on classroom training to thousands of medical professionals each year prior to deployment. 

First deployed in 2003, MC4 has fielded systems to tactical medical units throughout [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and [[Afghanistan]], making it the most comprehensive information management/information technology medical system deployed to date.

To ensure users fully utilize the system, MC4 support personnel overseas provide onsite support and refresher trainings. 

This commitment is supported by four regional support centers in the U.S. and Europe, and a 24-7, online helpdesk, providing a worldwide sustainment and technical support structure.

== Supporting the Future ==
The U.S. Army recognizes that the MC4 system is an evolving capability required to support current and emerging medical information technologies needed by deployed medical forces.  

As such, MC4 PMO is strategically integrating with future Army systems, including the Future Combat System (FCS) and the [[Future Force Warrior]] Program. MC4 will provide an interface to these systems that enables automated assessment and remote monitoring capabilities for deployed medical forces.
