The '''Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services''' ('''CMS'''), previously known as the '''Health Care Financing Administration''' ('''HCFA'''), is a federal agency within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) that administers the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program and works in partnership with state governments to administer [[Medicaid]], the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), and [[health insurance]] portability standards.  In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in [[long-term care]] facilities (more commonly referred to as [[nursing home]]s) through its survey and certification process, and clinical laboratory quality standards under the [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]].

==History==
President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Social Security Amendments of 1965|Social Security Act]] on July 30, 1965, establishing both Medicare and Medicaid. The [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) became responsible for the administration of Medicare and the Social and Rehabilitation Service (SRS) became responsible for the administration of Medicaid. Both agencies were organized under what was then known as the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW).

In 1977, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was established under HEW. HCFA became responsible for the coordination of Medicare and Medicaid. The responsibility for enrolling beneficiaries into Medicare and processing premium payments remained with SSA.

The CMS developed and uses several systems to classify Medicare cases. Hospital cases are classified using the [[Diagnosis-related group|Diagnosis-Related Group]] (DRG); outpatient cases are classified using the [[Ambulatory Patient Group]] (APG). These systems are used to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital or provider for each service or product.

== Workforce ==

The CMS employs approximately 4,100 employees, of which 2,700 are located at its headquarters in [[Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland|Woodlawn, Maryland]]. The remaining employees are located in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the 10 regional offices listed below, and in various field offices located throughout the United States.

The head of the CMS is the Administrator of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The position is [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate]].<ref name=kliff2011>{{Citation
