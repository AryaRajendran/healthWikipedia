The '''Epworth Sleepiness Scale''' ('''ESS''') is a [[Likert_Scale|scale]] intended to measure daytime [[sleep]]iness that is measured by use of a very short questionnaire.  This can be helpful in  diagnosing [[sleep disorder]]s. It was introduced in 1991 by Dr Murray Johns of [[Epworth Hospital]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]].<ref name=Johns1991>{{cite journal |author=Johns MW |title=A new method for measuring daytime sleepiness: the Epworth sleepiness scale |journal=Sleep |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |year=1991 |pmid=1798888 |doi=}}</ref>

==The questionnaire==
The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives, though not necessarily every day.<ref name=Johns1991/> The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0–9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10–24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought.<ref name=Johns1991/> For instance, scores of 11-15 are shown to indicate the possibility of mild to moderate sleep apnea, where a score of 16 and above indicates the possibility of severe sleep apnea or narcolepsy.<ref name=Johns1991/> Certain questions in the scale were shown to be better predictors of specific sleep disorders, though further tests may be required to provide an accurate diagnosis. <ref name=Johns1991/> 

The questionnaire was originally created with the intent to preserve the exact wording of the questionnaire to provide a standardized test and to preserve its [[Validity_(statistics)|validity]]; the author of the ESS recommends that the administrator of the questionnaire does not discuss the results of the ESS with the subject until it is completed, as this may affect the subject's responses on the questionnaire. <ref>[http://epworthsleepinessscale.com/about-epworth-sleepiness/ The Epworth Sleepiness Scale: What the Epworth Sleepiness Scale is and how to use it]</ref>

==Calibration==
The Epworth sleepiness scale has been validated primarily in [[sleep apnea|obstructive sleep apnea]], though it has also shown success in detecting [[narcolepsy]] and [[idiopathic hypersomnia]].<ref name=Johns1991/> It is used to measure [[excessive daytime sleepiness]] and is repeated after the administration of treatment (e.g., [[positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) to document improvement of symptoms.<ref name="pmid7494915">{{cite journal |author=Hardinge FM, Pitson DJ, Stradling JR |title=Use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to demonstrate response to treatment with nasal continuous positive airways pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea |journal=Respir Med |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=617–20 |year=1995 |pmid=7494915 |doi=10.1016/0954-6111(95)90230-9}}</ref> In [[narcolepsy]], the Epworth sleepiness scale has both a high [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] (100%) and [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] (93.5%).<ref name="Johns">{{ cite journal | last=Johns | first=MW | title=Sensitivity and specificity of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), the maintenance of wakefulness test and the epworth sleepiness scale: failure of the MSLT as a gold standard | journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 | date=March 2000 | pmid=10733683 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119047612/HTMLSTART | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2000.00177.x | accessdate=2008-07-22 }}</ref> 

The Epworth sleepiness scale has been used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of other similar measurements of sleep quality. <ref name="pas_15_2_137">{{ cite journal | author=Levine DW, Kripke DF, Kaplan RM, Lewis MA, Naughton MJ, Bowen DJ, Shumaker SA | title=Reliability and validity of the Women's Health Initiaive Insomnia Rating Scale | journal=Psychological Assessment | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=137–148 | year=2003 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.15.2.137 }}</ref> <ref name="pas_23_3_587">{{ cite journal | author=Koffel E | title=Further validation of the Iowa Sleep Disturbances Inventory | journal=Psychological Assessment | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=587–598 | year=2011 | doi=10.1037/a0022818 }}</ref>
