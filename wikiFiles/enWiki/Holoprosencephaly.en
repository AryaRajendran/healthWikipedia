'''Holoprosencephaly''' ('''HPE''', once known as '''arhinencephaly''') is a [[cephalic disorder]] in which the [[prosencephalon]] (the [[forebrain]] of the [[embryo]]) fails to [[Prenatal development|develop]] into two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]s. Normally, the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of [[human pregnancy]]. The condition also occurs in other species.

The condition can be mild or severe. According to the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] (NINDS), "in most cases of holoprosencephaly, the [[malformation]]s are so severe that babies die before birth.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/holoprosencephaly/holoprosencephaly.htm NINDS Holoencephalopathy Information Page]</ref>

When the embryo's forebrain does not divide to form bilateral [[cerebral hemispheres]] (the left and right halves of the brain), it causes [[Congenital abnormality|defects]] in the development of the [[face]] and in brain structure and function.

In less severe cases, babies are born with normal or near-normal [[brain development]] and facial deformities that may affect the eyes, nose, and upper lip.

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of holoprosencephaly range from mild (no facial/organ defects, [[anosmia]], or only a single central [[incisor]]) to moderate to severe (cyclopia).

There are three classifications of holoprosencephaly.
[[Image:Alobar holoprosencephaly.jpg|thumb|[[Gross pathology]] specimen from a case of alobar holoprosencephaly.]]
* Alobar holoprosencephaly, the most serious form, in which the brain fails to separate, is usually associated with severe facial anomalies, including lack of a nose and the eyes merged to a single median structure, see [[Cyclopia]]
* Semilobar holoprosencephaly, in which the brain's hemispheres have somewhat divided, is an intermediate form of the disease.
* Lobar holoprosencephaly, in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain hemispheres, is the least severe form. In some cases of lobar holoprosencephaly, the patient's brain may be nearly normal.
* Syntelencephaly, or middle interhemispheric variant of holoprosencephaly (MIHV), in which the posterior [[frontal lobe]] and the [[parietal lobe]] are not properly separated, but the [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostro]][[Anatomical terms of location|basal]] forebrain properly separates; it is possible that this is not a variant of HPE at all, but is currently classified as such<ref name="Peds NeuroRad">{{cite book | pages=92–95 | chapter = Brain Malformations | title = Pediatric Neuroradiology: Brain, Head, Neck and Spine | editor = Totori-Donati, Paolo; Rossi, Andrea; Raybaud, C. | year = 2005 | volume = 1 | isbn = 3-540-41077-5 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | author = Totori-Donati, Paolo; Rossi, Andrea; Biancheri, Roberta }}</ref>

== Presentation ==
Holoprosencephaly consists of a spectrum of defects or malformations of the brain and face. At the most severe end of this spectrum are cases involving serious malformations of the brain, malformations so severe that they often cause [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]]. At the other end of the spectrum are individuals with facial defects&nbsp;which may affect the [[Human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and upper [[lip]] - and normal or near-normal brain development. [[Seizures]] and [[mental retardation]] may occur.

The most severe of the facial defects (or [[Birth defect|anomalies]]) is [[cyclopia]], an abnormality characterized by the development of a single [[Human eye|eye]], located in the area normally occupied by the root of the [[human nose|nose]], and a missing nose or a nose in the form of a [[Proboscis (anomaly)|proboscis]] (a tubular appendage) located above the eye. The condition is also referred to as cyclocephaly or synophthalmia, and is very rare.

== Causes ==
The exact cause(s) of HPE are yet to be determined, although the presence of toxins may be suspected. However, it often seems that there is no specific cause at all.<ref name="Carter">{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/hpe/about/ | title=About Holoprosencephaly | author=The Carter Centers for Brain Research in Holoprosencephaly and Related Malformations}}</ref>

=== Genetics ===
[[Armand Marie Leroi]] describes the cause of [[cyclopia]] as a genetic malfunctioning during the process by which the [[embryo]]nic brain is divided into two.<ref name="Mutants">[[Armand Marie Leroi]], ''[[Mutant]]s: On the Form, Varieties and Errors of the Human Body'', 2003, Harper Perennial, London. ISBN 0-00-653164-4</ref> Only later does the [[visual cortex]] take recognizable form, and at this point an individual with a single [[forebrain]] region will be likely to have a single, possibly rather large, eye (at such a time, individuals with separate cerebral hemispheres would form two eyes)

Increases in [[Gene expression|expression]] of such [[gene]]s as [[Pax-2]], as well as inhibition of [[Pax-6]], from the [[notochord]] have been implicated in normal differentiation of cephalic midline structures. Inappropriate expression of any of these genes may result in mild to severe forms of holoprosencephaly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Other [[candidate gene]]s have been located, including the [[Sonic hedgehog|SHH]] (holoprosencephaly type 3 aka HPE3), [[TGIF (cell biology)|TGIF]], [[ZIC2]] and [[SIX3]] genes.<ref>The Carter Center for Research in holoprosencephaly [http://www.stanford.edu/group/hpe/] and [http://www.holoprosencephaly.net]</ref>

Although many children with holoprosencephaly have normal [[chromosomes]], specific [[chromosomal abnormalities]] have been identified in some patients ([[trisomy]] of [[chromosome 13]], also known as [[Patau syndrome]]). There is evidence that in some families, HPE is inherited ([[autosomal dominant]] as well as [[Autosomal recessive|autosomal]] or [[X-linked recessive]] [[inheritance]]) {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. Features consistent with familial transmission of the disease (e.g., a single central [[maxillary incisor]]) should be carefully assessed in parents and family members.

=== Non-genetic factors ===
Numerous possible [[risk factor]]s have been identified, including [[gestational diabetes]], [[Perinatal infection|transplacental infections]] (the "[[TORCH complex]]"), [[first trimester bleeding]], and a history of [[miscarriage]].<ref name="Carter"/><ref name="California">{{cite journal| coauthors=Croen, Lisa A.; Shaw, Gary M.; Lammer, Edward J. |year=2000 |title=Risk Factors For Cytogenetically Normal Holoprosencephaly in California: A Population-Based Case-Control Study |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|publisher=[[Wiley-Liss]] |volume=90 |pages=320–325 |accessdate=September 11, 2009 | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(20000214)90:4<320::AID-AJMG11>3.0.CO;2-8| pmid=10710231| last1=Croen| first1=LA| issue=4}}</ref> As well, the disorder is found twice as often in [[female]] babies.<ref name="California"/> However, there appears to be no correlation between HPE and [[maternal age]].<ref name="California"/>

There is evidence of a correlation between HPE and the use of [[Drugs in pregnancy|various drugs]] [[Drugs in pregnancy#Classification of a few important drugs/vaccines|classified]] as being potentially unsafe for pregnant and [[lactating]] mothers. These include [[insulin]], [[birth control pills]], [[aspirin]], [[lithium]], [[thorazine]], [[retinoic acid]], and the [[anticonvulsants]].<ref name="California"/> There is also a correlation between [[alcohol consumption]] and HPE, along with [[nicotine]], the [[List of additives in cigarettes|toxins in cigarettes]] and [[List of cigarette smoke constituents|toxins in cigarette smoke]] when used [[Effects of smoking during pregnancy|during pregnancy]]).<ref name="California"/>

== Prognosis ==
HPE is not a condition in which the brain deteriorates over time. Although serious seizure disorders, autonomic dysfunction, complicated [[endocrine]] disorders and other life-threatening conditions may sometimes be associated with HPE, the mere presence of HPE does not mean that these serious problems will occur or develop over time without any previous indication or warning. These abnormalities are usually recognized shortly after [[birth]] or early in life and only occur if areas of the brain controlling those functions are fused, malformed or absent.

Prognosis is dependent upon the degree of fusion and malformation of the brain, as well as other health complications that may be present.

The more severe forms of encephalopathy are usually fatal. This disorder consists of a spectrum of defects, malformations and associated abnormalities. [[Disability]] is based upon the degree in which the brain is affected. Moderate to severe defects may cause mental retardation, [[spastic]] quadriparesis, [[athetoid]] movements, endocrine disorders, [[epilepsy]] and other serious conditions; mild brain defects may only cause learning or behavior problems with few motor impairments.

Seizures may develop over time with the highest risk before 2 years of age and the onset of [[puberty]]. Most are managed with one [[medication]] or a combination of medications. Typically, seizures that are difficult to control appear soon after birth, requiring more aggressive medication combinations/doses.

Most children with HPE are at risk of having elevated blood [[sodium]] levels during moderate-severe illnesses, that alter fluid intake/output, even if they have no previous diagnosis of diabetes insipidus or [[hypernatremia]].
