The '''Bureau of Health Professions''' is a part of the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].

[[HRSA]] programs train health care professionals and place them where they are needed most. Grants support scholarship and loan repayment programs at colleges and universities to meet critical workforce shortages and promote diversity within the health professions.

== Key Facts ==

* [[HRSA]] closely tracks trends in the national healthcare workforce, and issues targeted grants to colleges and universities for scholarship, student loan and debt repayment programs designed to stimulate interest in clinical specialties in which shortages are expected. About 8,000 students graduate each year from these HRSA-supported institutions — and one of every three goes to work serving the disadvantaged.
* [[HRSA]] promotes the recruitment, training and placement of minority candidates in [[Health Professional Shortage Areas]] (HPSAs) to ensure that the workforce is culturally sensitive and linguistically capable to serve patients of every background.
* [[HRSA]] is the lead federal agency responsible for collecting data, and certifying communities as Health Professional Shortage Areas. The designation takes into consideration such factors as the prevailing rate of poverty and infant mortality; the number of physicians per 1,000 residents; and travel distances to nearest available care.  The HPSA designation determines eligibility for numerous federal and state aid programs, including the National Health Service Corps, Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program and Rural Health Clinic Certification.

== History ==

[[HRSA]]’s health professions programs began in June 1967 and were originally part of the Public Health Service.  Over the next decade, these programs were transferred to the National Institutes of Health. By 1980 the programs were transferred to one of HRSA’s predecessor agencies, the Health Resources Administration.
