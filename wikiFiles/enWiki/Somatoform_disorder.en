In [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]], a '''somatoform disorder''' is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by symptoms that suggest [[physical illness]] or injury – symptoms that cannot be explained fully by a general medical condition or by the direct effect of a substance, and are not attributable to another mental disorder (e.g., [[panic disorder]]).<ref name="dsm-iv">American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR. American Psychiatric Pub. ISBN 978-0-89042-025-6. pp 485</ref> The symptoms of a somatoform disorder are considered to be due to a hard wiring problem within the brain where thoughts are sent down into the body through the Autonomic Nervous System to become symptoms instead of being sent up into the conscious area of the brain{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. In people who have a somatoform disorder, medical test results are either normal or do not explain the person's symptoms, and history and physical examination do not indicate the presence of a medical condition that could cause them. Patients with this disorder often become worried about their health because doctors are unable to find a cause for their symptoms. This may cause severe distress. Preoccupation with the symptoms may portray a patient's exaggerated belief in the severity of their ill-health.<ref>Oyama, Oliver.

Web. 30 Nov. 2011. <http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1333.html>.</ref> Symptoms are sometimes similar to those of other illnesses and may last for several years. Usually, the symptoms begin appearing during adolescence, and patients are diagnosed before the age of 30 years.<ref name="pmid9107152">{{cite journal |author=La France, Jr. W.

Somatoform disorders are not the result of conscious [[malingering]] (fabricating or exaggerating symptoms for secondary motives) or [[factitious disorders]] (deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms) – sufferers perceive their plight as real. Additionally, a somatoform disorder should not be confused with the more specific diagnosis of a [[somatization disorder]]. Various laboratory tests, physical examinations, and surgeries on these individuals show no evidence supporting the idea that these exaggerating symptoms are present.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curt|first=LaFrance|coauthors=Jr, W Curt|title=Somatoform disorders|journal=Seminars in neurology|date=01|year=2009|month=07|volume=29|issue=3|pages=234|doi=10.1055/s-0029-1223875|pmid=19551600|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Somatoform+disorders&rft.jtitle=Seminars+in+neurology&rft.au=LaFrance%2C+Jr%2C+W+Curt&rft.date=2009-07-01&rft.volume=29&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=234&rft_id=info:pmid/19551600&rft.externalDocID=19551600|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>  
Mental disorders are treated separately from physiological or neurological disorders. Somatoform disorder is difficult to diagnose and treat since doing so requires psychiatrists to work with neurologists on patients with this disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=LaFrance, C.W. |title=Somatoform Disorders| journal = SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY, V. 29 (3), 06/2009, pp. 234–246}}</ref> Those that do not pass the diagnostic criteria for a somatoform disorder but still present physical symptoms are usually referred to as having "somatic preoccupation".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Oyama O., Paltoo C., Greengold J. | year = 2007 | title = Somatoform disorders | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/234242021?accountid=14771 | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 76 | issue = 9| pages = 1333–8 }}</ref>

==Recognized somatoform disorders==
The somatoform disorders are actually a group of disorders, all of which fit the definition of physical symptoms that mimic physical disease or injury for which there is no identifiable physical cause; as such, they are a [[diagnosis of exclusion]]. They are recognized by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as the following:<ref name="dsm-iv"/>
*[[Conversion disorder]]: A somatoform disorder  involving the actual loss of bodily function such as blindness, paralysis, and numbness due to excessive anxiety 
*[[Somatization disorder]]: A disorder characterized by multiple physical complaints which do not have a medical explanation.<ref>Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D.M. (2011). Psychology: Second Edition. New York, NY: Worth</ref>
*[[Hypochondriasis]]: A somatoform disorder involving persistent and excessive worry about developing a serious illness. 
*[[Body dysmorphic disorder]]
*[[Pain disorder]]
*Undifferentiated somatoform disorder – only one unexplained symptom is required for at least 6 months.
Included among these disorders are false pregnancy, psychogenic urinary retention, and mass psychogenic illness (so-called mass hysteria).

*Somatoform disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=FjFRlHUdrXIC&lpg=PA444&dq=Somatoform%20disorder%20Not%20otherwise%20specified&pg=PA444#v=onepage&q=Somatoform%20disorder%20Not%20otherwise%20specified&f=false | title = Essentials of Clinical Psychiatry | isbn = 9781585620333 | author1 = Hales | first1 = Robert E | last2 = Yudofsky | first2 = Stuart C | year = 2004}}</ref>

The [[ICD-10]] classifies conversion disorder as a [[dissociative disorder]].

==Proposed somatoform disorders==
Additional proposed somatoform disorders are:
* Abridged somatization disorder<ref name="pmid2918297">{{cite journal |author=Escobar JI, Rubio-Stipec M, Canino G, Karno M |title=Somatic symptom index (SSI): a new and abridged somatization construct. Prevalence and epidemiological correlates in two large community samples |journal=J. Nerv. Ment.

* Multisomatoform disorder<ref name="pmid9107152">{{cite journal |author=Kroenke K, Spitzer RL, deGruy FV, ''et al.'' |title=Multisomatoform disorder. An alternative to undifferentiated somatoform disorder for the somatizing patient in primary care |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=352–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9107152 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1997.01830160080011}}</ref> – at least 3 unexplained somatic complaints from the PRIME-MD scale for at least 2 years of active symptoms

These disorders have been proposed because the recognized somatoform disorders are either too restrictive or too broad. In a study of 119 primary care patients, the following prevalences were found:<ref name="pmid15014690">{{cite journal |author=Lynch DJ, McGrady A, Nagel R, Zsembik C |title=Somatization in Family Practice: Comparing 5 Methods of Classification |journal= Primary care companion to the Journal of clinical psychiatry|volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=85–89 |year=1999 |pmid=15014690 |doi= 10.4088/PCC.v01n0305|pmc=181067}}</ref>
* [[Somatization disorder]] – 1%
* Abridged somatization disorder – 6%
* Multisomatoform disorder – 24%
* Undifferentiated somatoform disorder – 69%

==DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic Criteria for Somatization Disorder==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] fourth edition, DSM IV-TR, defines somatization disorder as:<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref>

A. A history of many physical complaints beginning before age 30 years, occurring over several years, resulting in
seeking treatment, or signiﬁcant impairment.

B. Each one of the following criteria must have been met, with individual symptoms occurring at any time:

1. Four pain symptoms (related to different sites or functions)

2. Two gastrointestinal symptoms (other than pain)

3. One sexual symptom (other than pain)

4. One "pseudoneurological" symptom (not limited to pain)

C. Either (1) or (2):

1. after appropriate investigation, each of the symptoms cannot be fully explained by a known general medical condition (GMC) or direct effects of a substance.

2. when there is a related GMC, the physical complaints or resulting impairment are in excess of what would be expected from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory ﬁndings.

D. The symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned(as in factitious disorder or malingering).
