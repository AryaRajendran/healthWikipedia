'''Bilirubin''' (formerly referred to as '''hematoidin''') is the yellow breakdown product of normal [[heme]] [[catabolism]]. Heme is found in [[hemoglobin]], a principal component of [[red blood cell]]s. Bilirubin is excreted in [[bile]] and [[urine]], and elevated levels may indicate certain diseases. It is responsible for the yellow color of [[bruise]]s, the background straw-yellow color of urine (via its reduced breakdown product, [[urobilin]] – the more obvious but variable bright yellow colour of urine is due to [[thiochrome]], a breakdown product of [[thiamine]]), the brown color of [[feces]] (via its conversion to [[stercobilin]]), and the yellow discoloration in [[jaundice]].

It has also been found in plants.<ref name="pmid19206232">{{Cite journal

== Chemistry ==
Bilirubin consists of an open chain of four [[pyrrole]]-like rings ([[tetrapyrrole]]). In [[heme]], by contrast, these four rings are connected into a larger ring, called a [[porphyrin]] ring.

Bilirubin can be "conjugated" with a molecule of [[glucuronic acid]] which makes it soluble in water (see below). This is an example of [[glucuronidation]].

Bilirubin is very similar to the [[pigment]] [[phycobilin]] used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment [[phytochrome]] used by plants to sense light. All of these contain an open chain of four pyrrolic rings.

Like these other pigments, some of the double-bonds in bilirubin [[Cis-trans isomerism|isomerize]] when exposed to light. This is used in the [[phototherapy]] of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McDonagh|first=Antony F|coauthors=Palma, LA; Lightner DA|title=Blue Light and Bilirubin Excretion|journal=Science|date=11|year=1980|month=April|volume=208|pages=145–151|bibcode=1980Sci...208..145M|last2=Palma|last3=Lightner|doi=10.1126/science.7361112|pmid=7361112|issue=4440}}</ref> This allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile.

Some textbooks and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of bilirubin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsta.org/main/news/stories/college_science.php?news_story_ID=48991 |title=Bilirubin's Chemical Formula |accessdate=2007-08-14 |format= |work=}}</ref> The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer.

== Function ==
Bilirubin is created by the activity of [[biliverdin reductase]] on [[biliverdin]], a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Bilirubin, when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, in addition to the demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of bilirubin,<ref name="PMID 3029864">{{cite journal |author=Stocker R, Yamamoto Y, McDonagh AF, Glazer AN, Ames BN |title=Bilirubin is an antioxidant of possible physiological importance |journal=Science |volume=235 |pages=1043–6 |year=1987 |bibcode=1987Sci...235.1043S |last2=Yamamoto |last3=McDonagh |last4=Glazer |last5=Ames |doi=10.1126/science.3029864 |pmid=3029864 |issue=4792}}</ref> has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin's main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant.<ref name="pmid12456881">{{cite journal |author=Baranano DE, Rao M, Ferris CD, Snyder SH |title=Biliverdin reductase: A major physiologic cytoprotectant |journal=Proc.

== Metabolism ==
[[File:Heme Breakdown.png|thumb|250px|left|Heme metabolism]]

=== Unconjugated ===
[[Erythrocyte]]s (red blood cells) generated in the [[bone marrow]] are disposed of in the [[spleen]] when they get old or damaged. This releases [[hemoglobin]], which is broken down to [[heme]] as the globin parts are turned into [[amino acids]]. The heme is then turned into unconjugated bilirubin in the reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen. This unconjugated bilirubin is not soluble in water, due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. It is then bound to [[serum albumin|albumin]] and sent to the [[liver]]. 

The measurement of direct bilirubin depends on its reaction with diazosulfanilic acid to create [[azobilirubin]]. However, unconjugated bilirubin also reacts slowly with diazosulfanilic acid, so that the measured indirect bilirubin is an underestimate of the true unconjugated concentration.

=== Conjugated ===
In the liver bilirubin is conjugated with [[glucuronic acid]] by the enzyme [[glucuronyltransferase]], making it soluble in water. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. However 95% of the secreted bile is reabsorbed by the small intestine. This bile is then resecreted by the liver into the small intestine. This process is known as [[enterohepatic circulation]].

About half of the conjugated bilirubin remaining in the large intestine (about 5% of what was originally secreted) is metabolised by colonic bacteria to form [[urobilinogen]], which may be further oxidized to [[urobilin]] and [[stercobilin]]. Urobilin, stercobilin and their degradation products give feces its brown color.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuntz|first=Erwin|title=Hepatology: Textbook and Atlas|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Germany|isbn=978-3-540-76838-8|pages=38}}</ref>  However, just like bile, some of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed and 95% of what is reabsorbed is resecreted in the bile which is also part of [[enterohepatic circulation]]. A small amount of the reabsorbed urobilinogen (about 5%) is excreted in the urine following further oxidation to [[urobilin]] which gives urine its characteristic yellow color. This whole process results in only 1–20% of secreted bile being lost in the feces. The amount lost depends on the secretion rate of bile.

Although the terms direct and indirect bilirubin are used equivalently with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, this is not quantitatively correct, because the direct fraction includes both conjugated bilirubin and δ bilirubin (bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease).<ref>Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 18th Edition, chap.352</ref> Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate conjugated bilirubin levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin).

=== Urine ===
Under normal circumstances, a tiny amount of urobilinogen, if any, is excreted in the [[urine]]. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, some of the conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving [[hemolytic anemia]], an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.

== Toxicity ==
Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in a new-born can lead to accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the [[basal nuclei]]) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, [[seizure]]s, abnormal [[reflexes]] and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as [[kernicterus]]. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the [[blood–brain barrier]] has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions that may lead to [[hyperbilirubinaemia]], neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the feces (this is largely why the feces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme [[glucuronidase|β-glucuronidase]] and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the [[enterohepatic circulation]].

== Associated Health Benefits ==
Recent research has indicated that in the absence of liver disease, individuals with high levels of total bilirubin may experience various health benefits exceeding those with lower levels of bilirubin. Studies have found higher levels of bilirubin in elderly individuals are associated with higher functional independence.<ref name=Kao>{{cite journal|last=Kao|first=TW|coauthors=Chou, CH; Wang, CC; Chou, CC; Hu, J; Chen, WL|title=Associations between serum total bilirubin levels and functional dependence in the elderly.|journal=Internal medicine journal|date=2012 Nov|volume=42|issue=11|pages=1199–207|pmid=22032210|doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02620.x}}</ref> Studies have also revealed that levels of serum bilirubin are inversely related to risk of certain heart diseases.<ref name=Novotný>{{cite journal|last=Novotný|first=L|coauthors=Vítek, L|title=Inverse relationship between serum bilirubin and atherosclerosis in men: a meta-analysis of published studies.|journal=Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)|date=2003 May|volume=228|issue=5|pages=568–71|pmid=12709588}}</ref><ref>Gilbert syndrome, UGT1A1*28 allele, and cardiovascular disease risk: possible protective effects and therapeutic applications of bilirubin.</ref>

== Blood tests ==
Bilirubin is broken down by light. Tubes containing blood or (especially) serum to be used in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination.

Bilirubin (in blood) is in one of two forms:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Abb.''' || '''Name(s)'''  || '''Water-soluble?''' || '''Reaction'''
 |-
 | "BC" || "Conjugated" or<br />"Direct bilirubin"   || Yes (bound to [[glucuronic acid]]) || Reacts quickly when dyes (diazo reagent) are added to the blood specimen to produce [[azobilirubin]] "Direct bilirubin"
 |-
 | "BU" || "Unconjugated" or "Indirect bilirubin" || No || Reacts more slowly. Still produces azobilirubin. Ethanol makes all bilirubin react promptly then calc: Indirect bilirubin = Total bilirubin – Direct bilirubin
|}

Total bilirubin ("TBIL") measures both BU and BC. Total and direct bilirubin levels can be measured from the blood, but indirect bilirubin is calculated from the total and direct bilirubin.

Indirect bilirubin is fat-soluble and direct bilirubin is water-soluble.

=== Measurement methods ===
Originally the [[Van den Bergh reaction]] was used for a qualitative estimate of bilirubin.

This test is performed routinely in most [[Medical laboratory|medical laboratories]] and can be measured by a variety of methods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Watson D, Rogers JA |title=A study of six representative methods of plasma bilirubin analysis |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=14 |pages=271–8 |year=1961 |month=May |pmid=13783422 |pmc=480210 |url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13783422 |doi=10.1136/jcp.14.3.271 |issue=3}}</ref>

Total bilirubin is now often measured by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct bilirubin is often measured by the method of Jendrassik and Grof.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rolinski B, Küster H, Ugele B, Gruber R, Horn K |title=Total bilirubin measurement by photometry on a blood gas analyzer: potential for use in neonatal testing at the point of care |journal=Clin.

== Blood levels==
There are no normal levels of bilirubin as it is an excretion product, and levels found in the body reflects the balance between production and excretion. Different sources provide [[Reference ranges for common blood tests|reference range]]s that are similar but not identical. Some examples for adults are provided below (different reference ranges are often used for newborns):

=== Hyperbilirubinemia ===
''Hyperbilirubinemia'' results from a higher-than-normal level of bilirubin in the blood.

Mild rises in bilirubin may be caused by:
*[[Hemolysis]] or increased breakdown of red blood cells
*[[Gilbert's syndrome]] – a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population
*[[Rotor syndrome]]: non-itching jaundice, with rise of bilirubin in the patient's serum, mainly of the conjugated type.

Moderate{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} rise in bilirubin may be caused by:
* [[Pharmaceutical drug]]s (especially [[antipsychotic]], some [[sex hormone]]s, and a wide range of other drugs)
:[[Sulfonamide]]s are contraindicated in infants less than 2 months old (exception when used with [[pyrimethamine]] in treating [[toxoplasmosis]]) as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to [[kernicterus]].<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch170/ch170n.html?qt=kernicterus&alt=sh#sec14-ch170-ch170n-404f Sulfonamides: Bacteria and Antibacterial Drugs: Merck Manual Professional<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* [[Hepatitis]] (levels may be moderate or high)
* [[Chemotherapy]]
* Biliary stricture (benign or malignant)

Very high{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} levels of bilirubin may be caused by:
* [[Neonatal jaundice|Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia]], where the newborn's liver is not able to properly process the bilirubin causing [[jaundice]]
* Unusually large bile duct obstruction, e.g. stone in common bile duct, tumour obstructing common bile duct etc.
* Severe liver failure with [[cirrhosis]] (e.g. [[primary biliary cirrhosis]])
* [[Crigler–Najjar syndrome]]
* [[Dubin–Johnson syndrome]]
* [[Choledocholithiasis]] (chronic or acute).

Cirrhosis may cause normal, moderately high or high levels of bilirubin, depending on exact features of the cirrhosis

To further elucidate the causes of jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler to look at other [[liver function tests]] (especially the enzymes [[alanine transaminase]], [[aspartate transaminase]], [[gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase]], [[alkaline phosphatase]]), [[blood film]] examination ([[hemolysis]], etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.).

=== Jaundice ===
[[Jaundice]] may be noticeable in the [[sclera]] (white) of the eyes at levels of about 2 to 3&nbsp;mg/dL (34 to 51 μmol/L),<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec03/ch022/ch022d.html Merck Manual Jaundice] Last full review/revision July 2009 by Steven K. Herrine</ref> and in the skin at higher levels.
For conversion, 1&nbsp;mg/dL = 17.1 µmol/L.<ref>SI Units for Clinical Data; http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/clinical_data.html</ref>

Jaundice is classified depending upon whether the bilirubin is free or conjugated to [[glucuronic acid]] into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}<!-- not according to [[jaundice]]--> .

== Urine tests ==
Urine levels of bilirubin may also be clinically significant.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003595|Bilirubin – urine}}</ref>
