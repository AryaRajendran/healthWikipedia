A '''poison control center''' is a [[medical]] facility that is able to provide immediate, free, and expert treatment advice and assistance over the [[telephone]] in case of exposure to [[poison]]ous or hazardous substances. Poison control centers answer questions about potential poisons in addition to providing treatment management advice about household products, [[medicines]], [[pesticides]], [[plants]], [[bites]] and [[Stinger (organ)|stings]], [[food poisoning]], and [[Vapor|fumes]]. More than 72%<ref name=AAPCC>{{cite web|title=American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS) Annual Report|url=www.aapcc.org|date=2009}}</ref> of poison exposure cases are managed simply by phone, greatly reducing the need for costly emergency room and doctor visits.<ref name="Miller-1997">{{Cite journal| author = Miller T, Lestina D | title = Costs of poisoning in the United States and savings from poison control centers: a benefit-cost analysis | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 239–245 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9018189 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(97)70275-0}}</ref>  

In the United States and many of its territories poison control centers can be reached by calling 1-800-222-1222.  Free, private, expert help is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and in more than 150 languages.

In Canada consult the Canadian Association of Poison Control Centers

Many other countries also have a poison control center network.  The WHO maintains a  [http://www.who.int/ipcs/poisons/centre/en/ worldwide directory].

For those currently exposed to a poison in a country that does not have a poison control system, visit a local doctor or hospital.

==History==
After [[World War II]] there was a proliferation of new [[drug]]s and [[chemicals]] in the marketplace, and consequently suicide and childhood [[poison]]ings from these agents drastically increased. Around this time up to half of all accidents in children were poisonings with a substantial number of fatalities.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Grayson R | title = The poison control movement in the United States | journal = Ind Med Surg | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 296–7 | year = 1962 | pmid = 13901334}}</ref> These factors led to the medical community developing a response to both unintentional and intentional poisonings. In [[Europe]] in the late 1940s special toxicology wards were set up, initial wards were started in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Budapest]], and the [[Netherlands]] began a poison information service.<ref name="Pediatr Clin North Am1970-Govaerts">{{Cite journal| author = Govaerts M | title = Poison control in Europe | journal = Pediatr Clin North Am | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 729–39 | year = 1970 | pmid = 5491436}}</ref> In the [[USA]] the first poison information center was started in [[Chicago]] in 1953.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Press E, Mellins R | title = A poisoning control program | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 44 | issue = 12 | pages = 1515–1525 | year = 1954|pmid = 13207477 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.44.12.1515 | pmc = 1621008}}</ref> By 1957 there were 17 poison control centers in the US, with the Chicago center serving as a model; these centers dealt mainly with physician enquiries by giving ingredient and toxicity information about products, along with treatment recommendations. Over time the poison control centers started taking calls from the general public. The majority of poison centers were not part of a patient treatment facility; they strictly provided information.

In 1958 the [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] (AAPCC) was founded to promote cooperation between poison centers in different cities and to standardize the operation of these centers. An additional part of the AAPCC's activities was poison prevention and education programs for both physicians and the general public. In 1968 the American Academy of Clinical Toxicologists (AACT) was established by a group of medical doctors. The AACT’s main objective was to apply principles of [[toxicology]] to patient treatment and improve the standard of care on a national basis. In the 1960s and 1970s a rapid proliferation of poison centers emerged and by 1978 there were 661 centers in the USA. This trend reversed during the 1980s and 1990s with a number of centers closing or merging. In 2000 there were 51 certified centers in the USA.<ref name="Clinical toxicology2001-ford">{{Cite book| editor = Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T. | title = Clinical toxicology | year = 2001 | publisher = WB Saunders Company | isbn = 0-7216-5485-1}}</ref> Today there are 61 centers operating.<ref name="pmid18163234">{{Cite journal|author=Bronstein AC, Spyker DA, Cantilena LR, Green J, Rumack BH, Heard SE |title=2006 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS) |journal=Clin Toxicol (Phila) |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=815–917 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18163234 |doi=10.1080/15563650701754763 |url=}}</ref>

A similar movement evolved in Europe but unlike the American movement the majority were centralized toxicology treatment centers with integrated poison information centers. The [[France|French]] developed an inpatient unit for the treatment of poisoned patients in the late 1950s. In [[England]] the National Poison Information Service was developed at [[Guy's Hospital]] under Dr Roy Goulding.<ref name="Pediatr Clin North Am1970-Govaerts"/>  At around the same time Dr Henry Mathew started a poison treatment center in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Proudfoot A | title = Clinical toxicology&mdash;past, present and future | journal = Hum Toxicol | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 481–487 | year = 1988|pmid = 3056845 | doi = 10.1177/096032718800700516}}</ref> In 1964 the European Association for Poison Control Centers was formed at [[Tours]], [[France]].<ref name="Pediatr Clin North Am1970-Govaerts"/><ref name="Persson">{{Cite journal|author=Persson H |title=European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists |journal=J.

The [[New Zealand]] center started in [[Dunedin]] in December 1964, while in [[Australia]], the [[New South Wales]] Poisons Information Center was established in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web| last = | first = | title =History of the New Zealand Poison Centre  | publisher = New Zealand National Poison Centre  | date =  | url =http://poisons.co.nz/history.php?PHPSESSID=448b2d797d85627dffcff23a86c57505 | accessdate = 2008-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last = | first = | title =About the NSW Poisons Information Centre  | publisher = NSW Poisons Information Centre  | date = 14 January 2008 | url =http://www.chw.edu.au/poisons/about.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-20}}</ref>

==Today==
===USA===
The [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] manages a 24-hour hotline, (1-800-222-1222) which is continuously staffed by pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and poison information specialists who have received dedicated training in the field of toxicology. Calls to the number are automatically routed to the poison control center that covers the territory from which the call is placed.  It has a [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TTY/TDD]] number for the hearing impaired. Poison educators across the country also offer poison prevention training and education sessions to community institutions, along with educational materials.<ref>{{Cite web| last = | first = | title =American Association of Poison Control Centers  | publisher = AAPCC | date = | url =http://www.aapcc.org/DNN/ | accessdate = 2008-12-01}}</ref>

===Rest of the world===
Most countries have a poison control center with staffing similar to the American centers. A worldwide directory of poison centers is available from the [[World Health Organization]]'s website.<ref>{{Cite web| last = The International Programme on Chemical Safety| first = | title =World directory of poisons centres  | publisher = [[World Health Organization]]  | date = | url =http://www.who.int/ipcs/poisons/centre/directory/en/ | accessdate = 2008-01-20}}</ref>
