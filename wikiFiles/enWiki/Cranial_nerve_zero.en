The '''terminal nerve''', or '''cranial nerve zero''', was discovered by German scientist [[Gustav Fritsch]] in 1878 in the [[brain]]s of [[shark]]s. It was first found in [[human]]s in 1913,<ref name="Sex and the Secret Nerve">R. Douglas Fields, [http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ARTICLEID_CHAR=6F5419B5-2B35-221B-6F690390F54BE729 Sex and the Secret Nerve], February/March 2007; Scientific American Mind</ref> although its presence in humans remains controversial. However, a study has indicated that the terminal nerve is a common finding in the adult human brain.<ref name="ape">{{cite journal |author=Fuller GN, Burger PC |title=Nervus terminalis (cranial nerve zero) in the adult human |journal=Clin. Neuropathol. |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=279–83 |year=1990 |pmid=2286018}}</ref>

==Anatomy==
The terminal nerve appears just ahead of the other [[cranial nerves]] bilaterally as a microscopic [[plexus]] of [[myelination|unmyelinated]] [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nerve fascicle]]s in the [[subarachnoid]] space that covers [[gyrus rectus]]. This plexus appears near the [[cribriform plate]] and travels posteriorly toward the [[olfactory trigone]], [[medial olfactory gyrus]], and [[lamina terminalis]].<ref name="ape" />

The nerve is often overlooked in [[autopsies]] because it is unusually thin for a cranial nerve, and is often torn out upon exposing the brain. Careful [[dissection]] is necessary to visualize the nerve. Its purpose and mechanism of function is still open to debate; consequently, nerve zero is often not mentioned in [[anatomy]] textbooks.<ref name="Sex and the Secret Nerve"/>

==Function==
Although very close to<ref name="pmid15570592">{{cite journal |author=Von Bartheld CS |title=The terminal nerve and its relation with extrabulbar "olfactory" projections: lessons from lampreys and lungfishes |journal=Microsc. Res. Tech. |volume=65 |issue=1–2 |pages=13–24 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15570592 | doi=10.1002/jemt.20095}}</ref> (and often confused for a branch of) the [[olfactory nerve]], nerve zero is not connected to the [[olfactory bulb]], where smells are analyzed. This fact suggests that the nerve is either [[vestigial]] or may be related to the sensing of [[pheromones]]. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that nerve zero projects to the medial and lateral [[Septal nucleus|septal nuclei]], and the [[preoptic area]]s, all of which are involved in regulating [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] in [[mammal]]s.<ref name="Sex and the Secret Nerve"/>

==Development==
The [[zebrafish]] has been used as a developmental model in recent research.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whitlock KE |title=Development of the nervus terminalis: origin and migration |journal=Microsc. Res. Tech. |volume=65 |issue=1–2 |pages=2–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15570589 |doi=10.1002/jemt.20094}}</ref>

The connections between cranial nerve zero and the olfactory system has been extensively studied in human embryos. It was found to enter the brain at stages 17 and 18 from olfactory origins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Müller F, O'Rahilly R |title=Olfactory structures in staged human embryos |journal=Cells Tissues Organs (Print) |volume=178 |issue=2 |pages=93–116 |year=2004 |pmid=15604533 |doi=10.1159/000081720 |url=}}</ref>
