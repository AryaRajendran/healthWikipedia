Treatment for [[Parkinson's Disease]] (PD), due to its chronic nature, requires broad-based management including patient and family education, support group services, general wellness maintenance, exercise, and nutrition. At present, there is no cure for PD, but medications or surgery can provide relief from the symptoms.

While many medications treat Parkinson's, none actually reverse the effects of the disease or cure it. Furthermore, the gold standard treatment varies with the disease state. People with Parkinson's therefore often must take a variety of medications to manage the disease's symptoms.<ref>http://www.pdf.org/en/meds_treatments</ref> Several medications currently in development seek to better address motor fluctuations and nonmotor symptoms of PD. However, none are yet on the market with specific approval to treat Parkinson's.<ref>http://www.pdf.org/fall08_medications</ref>

==Pharmacologic==
The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are Levodopa, dopamine [[agonists]] and MAO-B inhibitors.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>  The most commonly used treatment approach varies depending on the disease stage. Two phases are usually distinguished: an initial phase in which the individual with PD has already developed some disability for which he needs pharmacological treatment, and a second stage in which the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage.<ref name="Nice-pharma">{{cite book |chapter= Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson’s disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 59–100}}</ref> Treatment in the initial state aims to attain an optimal tradeoff between good management of symptoms and side-effects resulting from enhancement of dopaminergic function.  The start of L-DOPA treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of causing the onset of dyskinesias to be retarded.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> In the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication, and overuse by some patients, also have to be controlled.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation can relieve the associated movement disorders.<ref name="pmid20937936"/>

===Levodopa===

[[File:Basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's.png|thumb|Circuits of the basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's disease. Model of the effect of medication on motor symptoms: [[levodopa]], [[dopamine agonists]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]] stimulate excitatory signals from the [[thalamus]] to the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] by effects on the [[striatum]], compensating for decreased dopaminergic signals from [[substantia nigra]] (seen at bottom right).]]

Levodopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) has been the most widely used treatment for over 30 years.<ref name="Nice-pharma">{{cite book |chapter= Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson’s disease| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 59–100}}</ref> L-DOPA is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|dopa-decarboxylase]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptomatology.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

Only 5-10% of L-DOPA crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]]. The remaining is often metabolised to dopamine elsewhere, causing a wide variety of side effects including [[nausea]], [[dyskinesia]]s and stiffness.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> [[Carbidopa]] and [[benserazide]] are  peripheral [[dopa decarboxylase inhibitor]]s.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> They inhibit the metabolism of L-DOPA in the periphery thereby increasing levodopa delivery to the central nervous system. They are generally given as combination preparations with levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Existing preparations are [[carbidopa/levodopa]] (co-careldopa, trade names ''Sinemet'', ''Parcopa'', ''Atamet'') and [[benserazide|benserazide/levodopa]] (co-beneldopa, trade name ''Madopar''). Levodopa has also been related to a [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]], which is a compulsive overuse of the medication, and punding.<ref name="pmid20123548">{{cite journal |author=Ceravolo R, Frosini D, Rossi C, Bonuccelli U |title=Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: definition, epidemiology, risk factors, neurobiology and management |journal=Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. |volume=15 Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=S111–5 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=20123548 |doi=10.1016/S1353-8020(09)70847-8 |url=}}</ref>

There are controlled [[Slow-release|release]] versions of ''Sinemet'' and ''Madopar'' that spread out the effect of the levodopa. [[Duodopa]] is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate release preparations.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

[[Tolcapone]] inhibits the catechol-O-methyltransferase [[COMT]] enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging the therapeutic effects of levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, have been used to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it's limited in its availability.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> A similar drug, [[entacapone]] has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Entacapone is available for treatment alone (''COMTan'') or combined with carbidopa and levodopa (''[[Stalevo]]'').<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

Levodopa results in a reduction in the endogenous formation of L-DOPA, and eventually becomes counterproductive. Levodopa preparations lead in the long term to the development of motor complications characterized by involuntary movements called [[dyskinesia]]s and fluctuations in the response to medication.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>  When this occurs PD patients change rapidly from stages with good response to medication and few symptoms ("on" state) to phases with no response to medication and important motor symptoms ("off" state).<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> For this reason levodopa doses are kept as low as possible while maintaining functionality.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Delaying the initiation of dopatherapy, using instead alternatives for some time, is also common practice.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> A former strategy to reduce motor complications was to withdraw patients from L-DOPA for some time. It is discouraged now since it can bring dangerous side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Most people will eventually need levodopa and later develop motor complications.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

The on-off phenomenon is an almost invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate that the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and that progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Re-distribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction, the use of selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intra-duodenal administration of levodopa.

It is critical that patients identify their on/off symptoms as early and with as much accuracy as possible. Your medical team will need accurate information to add additional therapies, shorten the time between doses, or suggest dietary or lifestyle changes.  Patients experiencing on/off may wish to use a free on-line tool that graphs the vaccilations quickly and easily.  The free on-line tool is available at www.datadrivenheatlh.org.

===Dopamine agonists===
[[Dopamine agonist]]s in the brain have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic post-synaptic receptors.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms with the aim of delaying motor complications.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg MM |title=Medical management of Parkinson's disease |journal=P & T |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=590–606 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=19750042 |pmc=2730785}}</ref> When used in late PD they are useful at reducing the off periods.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Dopamine agonists include [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[piribedil]], [[cabergoline]], [[apomorphine]], and [[lisuride]].

Agonists produce significant, although mild, side effects including [[somnolence]], [[hallucination]]s, [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], and [[constipation]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Sometimes side effects appear even at a the minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician to search for a different agonist or kind of drug.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> When compared with levodopa, while they delay motor complications they control worse symptoms.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Nevertheless they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years.<ref name="pmid15172778">{{cite journal |author=Samii A, Nutt JG, Ransom BR |title=Parkinson's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9423 |pages=1783–93 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15172778 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16305-8 }}</ref> They are also more expensive.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects more common in older patients.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> All this has led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to levodopa in the latter.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Agonists at higher doses have also been related to a wide variety of impulse control disorders.<ref name="pmid20123548"/>

[[Apomorphine]], which is a non-orally administered dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare it has been recommended that patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Apomorphine can be administered via subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial "apomorphine challenge" in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and [[primary caregiver]] (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]]. Apomorphine is also available in a more acute dose as an [[autoinjector]] pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require [[domperidone]] (an antiemetic).

A study performed by the Cochrane review enrolled 5247 patients with early PD and evaluated the efficacy of dopamine agonists compared to levodopa. The results show that patients who took dopamine agonists were less likely to develop dyskinesia (p<0.00001), dystonia (p=0.0002), and motor fluctuations (p=0.002) although were more likely to discontinue therapy due to negative side effects such as nausea, edema, constipation, etc.

===MAO-B inhibitors===
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitor]]s ([[Selegiline]] and [[rasagiline]]) increase the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking levodopa when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Although an initial study had as result that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death this has been later disproven.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

Metabolites of selegiline include L-amphetamine and L-methamphetamine (not to be confused with the more notorious and potent dextrorotary isomers).  This might result in side effects such as insomnia. Another side effect of the combination can be [[stomatitis]]. Unlike other non selective [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]], tyramine-containing foods do not cause a hypertensive crisis.

===Other drugs===
There is some indication that other drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[anticholinergic]]s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced they are not first choice treatments.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> In addition to motor PD is accompanied by an ample range of different symptoms. Different compounds are used to improve some of these problems.<ref name="Nice-NonMotor">{{cite book |chapter= Non-motor features of Parkinson’s disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 113–133}}</ref> Examples are the use of [[clozapine]] for psychosis, [[cholinesterase inhibitors]] for dementia and [[modafinil]] for day [[somnolence]].<ref name="Nice-NonMotor"/><ref name="pmid19559160"/>

A preliminary study indicates that taking the drug [[donepezil]] (''Aricept'') may help prevent falls in people with Parkinson's.  Donepezil boosts levels of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]], and is currently an approved therapy for the cognitive symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>[http://www.pdf.org/en/science_news/release/pr_1289501578 Donepezil (Aricept) Reduces Falls in People with Parkinson’s].  [[Parkinson's Disease Foundation]] Science News.  11 November 2010.</ref>  In the study, participants taking donepezil experienced falls half as often as those taking a placebo, and those who previously fell the most showed the most improvement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chung, KA. |title=Effects of a central cholinesterase inhibitor on reducing falls in Parkinson disease |journal=Neurology |date=October 2010 |volume=75 |issue=10 |pages=1263–1269 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181f6128c |last2=Lobb |first2=B.

The introduction of [[clozapine]] (''Clozaril'') represents a breakthrough in the treatment of psychotic symptoms of PD. Prior to its introduction, treatment of psychotic symptoms relied on reduction of dopamine therapy or treatment with first generation antipsychotics, all of which worsened motor function. Other [[atypical antipsychotic]]s useful in treatment include [[quetiapine]] (''Seroquel''), [[ziprasidone]] (''Geodon''), [[aripiprazole]] (''Abilify''), and [[paliperidone]] (''Invega''). Clozapine is believed to have the highest efficacy and lowest risk of extrapyramidal side effect.<ref name="pmid19559160">{{cite journal |author=Hasnain M, Vieweg WV, Baron MS, Beatty-Brooks M, Fernandez A, Pandurangi AK |title=Pharmacological management of psychosis in elderly patients with parkinsonism |journal=Am.

==Surgical==
[[Image:Parkinson surgery.jpg|thumb|Illustration showing an electrode placed deep seated in the brain]]
Treating PD with surgery was once a common practice. But after the discovery of levodopa, surgery was restricted to only a few cases.<ref name="Nice-surgery">{{cite book |chapter= Surgery for Parkinson’s disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 101–111}}</ref>  Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, and surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient.<ref name="Nice-surgery"/>

Less than 10% of PD sufferers qualify as suitable candidates for a surgical response. There are three different mechanisms of surgical response for PD: [[ablation|ablative surgery]], (the irreversible burning or freezing of brain [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]) stimulation surgery or deep brain stimulation (DBS), and transplantation or restorative surgery.<ref>[http://www.neurologychannel.com/parkinsonsdisease/surgery.shtml Parkinson's disease surgery] neurology Channel. Retrieved on 2010-02-02</ref>

Target areas for DBS or lesions include the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]] (the lesion technique being called [[pallidotomy]]) or the [[subthalamic nucleus]].<ref name="Nice-surgery"/>

===Neuroablative Lesion Surgery===
Neuroablative Lesion surgery (NAS) locates and destroys, by heat, the parts of the brain that are associated with producing Parkinsonian [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms. The procedures generally involve a thalamotomy and/or pallidotomy.

A thalamotomy is the destruction of a part of the thalamus, in particular the ventralis intermedius, in order to suppress tremor in 80-90% of patients.
If rigidity and akinesia are apparent, the subthalamis nucleus is then the sight of ablation. 

A pallidotomy involves the destruction of the globus pallidus, in particular the globus pallidus interna, in patients with Parkinson's that suffer from rigidity and akinesia. 

Because it is difficult to accurately measure the amount of tissue to be destroyed, it is not uncommon for [[tremor]]s to persist through multiple courses of surgery since tissue is irreversibly damaged and removed and it is safer to test smaller areas of tissue to prevent serious complications, such as a [[stroke]] or [[paralysis]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. This method has been generally replaced by deep brain surgery.

===Deep Brain Stimulation===
[[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) is presently the most used method of surgical treatment because it does not destroy brain tissue, it is reversible, and it can be tailored to each individual at their particular stage of disease. DBS employs three hardware components: a [[neurostimulator]], also called an implanted pulse generator (IPG), which generates electrical impulses used to modulate neural activity, a lead wire which directs the impulses to a number of metallic [[electrode]]s towards the tip of the lead near the stimulation target, and an extension wire that connects the lead to the IPG. The IPG, which is battery-powered and encased in titanium, is traditionally implanted under the collarbone, and is connected by the subcutaneous extension to the lead, which extends from outside the skull under the scalp down into the brain to the target of stimulation. The entire three component system is sometimes referred to as a [[brain pacemaker]], as the system operates on many of the same principles as [[Artificial pacemaker|medical cardiac pacing]].

The pre-operative targeting of proper implantation sites can be accomplished via the indirect and direct methods. 

The indirect method utilizes computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventriculography to locate the anterior and posterior commissures and then employs pre-determined coordinates and distances from the intercommissural line in order to define the target area. Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps can also be used to verify the target area (Nolte, 2012). The direct method provides visualization and targeting of deep nuclei by applying stereotactic pre-operative MRI, which unlike the indirect method, takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei’s size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals (Nolte, 2012)

Electrophysial functional mapping (EFM), a tool utilized in both methods in order to verify the target nuclei, has come under scrutiny due to its associated risks of hemorrhages, dysarthria or tetanic contractions. Recently, Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI), a type of MRI has shown incredible resolving power in its ability to distinguish these deep brain nuclei and is being used in DBS in order to reduce the over-use of EFM (Abosch, 2010). 

DBS is recommended to PD patients without important neuropsychiatric [[contraindication]]s who suffer motor fluctuations and tremor badly controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication.<ref name="pmid20937936">{{cite journal |author=Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, ''et al.'' |title=Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson Disease: An Expert Consensus and Review of Key Issues |journal=Arch Neurol |volume= 68|issue= 2|pages= 165–165|year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20937936 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.260 |url=}}</ref>

DBS is effective in suppressing symptoms of PD, especially tremor. A recent clinical study led to recommendations on identifying which Parkinson's patients are most likely to benefit from DBS.<ref name="pmid20937936" />

==Diet==
{{See also|Dietary management of Parkinson's disease}}
Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, therefore, it is common to experience [[constipation]] and [[gastroparesis]] (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period of time than normal).<ref name="pmid19691125"/> A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-[[Dietary fiber|fiber]] foods and plenty of water.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> When taken together the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> Therefore when levodopa is introduced excessive [[Protein (nutrient)|proteins]] are discouraged, while in advanced stages additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.<ref name="pmid19691125">{{cite journal |author=Barichella M, Cereda E, Pezzoli G |title=Major nutritional issues in the management of Parkinson's disease |journal=Mov.

==Palliative care==
[[Palliative care]] is often required in the final stages of the disease, often when dopaminergic treatments have become ineffective. The aim of palliative care is to achieve the maximum quality of life for the person with the disease and those surrounding him or her. Some central issues of palliative are; caring for patients at home while adequate care can be given there; reducing or withdrawing dopaminergic drug intake to reduce drug side effects and complications; preventing [[pressure ulcer]]s by management of pressure areas of inactive patients; facilitating the patient's end of life decisions for the patient as well as involved friends and relatives.<ref name="Nice-palliative">{{cite book |chapter= Palliative care in Parkinson’s disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 147–151}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Charcot1893.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1893 photograph of [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], who made important contributions to the understanding of the disease, including the proposal of [[anticholinergic]]s as treatments for tremor]]
The positive albeit modest effects of [[anticholinergic]] [[alkaloid]]s obtained from the plant of the [[Atropa belladona|belladona]] were described during 19th century by  [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]], Erb and others. Modern surgery for tremor, consisting of the lesioning of some of the basal ganglia structures was first tried in 1939, and was improved over the following 20 years.<ref name="pmid19892136">{{cite journal |author=Lanska DJ |title=Chapter 33: the history of movement disorders |journal=Handb Clin Neurol |volume=95 |issue= |pages=501–46 |year=2010 |pmid=19892136 |doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(08)02133-7 |url=}}</ref> Before this date surgery consisted in lesioning the [[corticospinal pathway]] with [[paralysis]] instead of tremor as result. Anticholinergics and surgery were the only treaments until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically.<ref name="pmid19892136"/><ref name="pmid9361073">{{cite journal |author=Guridi J, Lozano AM |title=A brief history of pallidotomy |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1169–80; discussion 1180–3 |year=1997 |month=November |pmid=9361073 |doi= 10.1097/00006123-199711000-00029|url=}}</ref> 

[[Levodopa]] was first synthesized in 1911 by [[Casimir Funk]], but it received little attention until the mid 20th century.<ref name="pmid18781671"/> It entered clinical practice in 1967, and the first large study reporting improvements in people with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with levodopa was published in 1968.

==Research directions==
{{See also|Parkinson's disease clinical research}}
There are no new PD treatments expected in the short time, however several lines of research are active for new treatments.<ref name=Dimond/> Such research directions include the search of new [[animal model]]s of the disease, and the potential usefulness of gene therapy, [[stem cell]]s transplants and [[neuroprotective]] agents.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>

===Animal models===
The tragedy of a group of drug addicts in California in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated and illicitly produced batch of the synthetic [[opiate]] [[MPPP]] brought to light [[MPTP]] as a cause of parkinsonian symptoms.<ref name="pmid6823561">{{cite journal |author=Langston JW, Ballard P, Tetrud JW, Irwin I |title=Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis |journal=Science |volume=219 |issue=4587 |pages=979–80 |year=1983 |month=February |pmid=6823561 |doi= 10.1126/science.6823561|url=}}</ref> Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide [[rotenone]], the herbicide [[paraquat]] and the fungicide [[maneb]].<ref name="pmid19729209">{{cite journal |author=Cicchetti F, Drouin-Ouellet J, Gross RE |title=Environmental toxins and Parkinson's disease: what have we learned from pesticide-induced animal models? |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy is currently under investigation.<ref name="pmid20495568"/><ref name="pmid20155994">{{cite journal |author=Feng, LR, Maguire-Zeiss KA |title=Gene Therapy in Parkinson's Disease: Rationale and Current Status |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=177–92 |year=2010|pmid=20155994 |pmc=2886503 |doi=10.2165/11533740-000000000-00000}}</ref> It involves the use of a non-infectious [[virus]] to shuttle a gene into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an [[enzyme]] which helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> As of 2010 there are four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>

=== Neuroprotective treatments ===
[[File:GDNF.jpg|thumb|While several chemical compounds such as GNDF (chemical structure pictured) have been proposed as neuroprotectors in PD, none has proven its efficacy.]]
Investigations on [[neuroprotective|neuroprotection]] are at the forefront of PD research. Currently, there are no proven neuroprotective agents or treatments available for Parkinson Disease (Medscape). While still theoretical, [[neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] therapy is based on the idea that certain [[neuron]]s that produces [[dopamine]] and are susceptible to premature [[degeneration]] and cell death can be protected by the introduction of neuroprotective [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. This protection can occur before any symptoms manifest based on genetic risk, and also during early or late-stage PD when other treatments have ceased their impact due to the progression of the disease. Accordingly, neuroprotective therapy seeks to delay the introduction of levodopa.

Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> However none of them has been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Agents currently under investigation include [[apoptosis|anti-apoptotic]]s ([[omigapil]], [[CEP-1347]]), [[glutamate|antiglutamatergic]]s, [[monoamine oxidase]] inhibitors ([[selegiline]], [[rasagiline]]), [[mitochondrial|promitochondrial]]s ([[coenzyme Q10]], [[creatine]]), [[calcium channel blocker]]s ([[isradipine]]) and [[growth factor]]s ([[GDNF]]).<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Preclinical research also targets [[alpha-synuclein]].<ref name=Dimond>{{citation |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/no-new-parkinson-disease-drug-expected-anytime-soon/77899336/ |title=No New Parkinson Disease Drug Expected Anytime Soon |author=Dimond PF |date=2010-08-16|work=GEN news highlights |publisher=GEN-Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News|accessdate=2010-10-25 }}</ref>

====Selegiline====
Selegiline is in a group of medications called monoamine oxidase type B ([[Monoamine oxidase B|MAO-B]]) [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibitors]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697046.html Selegiline Information] MedLine Plus. Retrieved on 2010-02-02</ref>
Selegiline is used to help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in people who are taking levodopa and carbidopa combination (Sinemet). Selegiline may help people with Parkinson's disease by... stopping the effects of levodopa/carbidopa from wearing off, and increasing the length of time that levodopa/carbidopa will continue to control symptoms.

====Rasagiline====
In response to potentially toxic [[amphetamine]] [[metabolite]]s caused by selegiline, another promising treatment is in MAO B [[propargyl]] [[amines|amine]] inhibitor [[rasagiline]] (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))). The oral [[bioavailability]] of rasagiline is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5–1 hours and its half-life is 1.5-3.5 hours. Rasagiline undergoes extensive hepatic [[metabolism]] primarily by [[cytochrome]] P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). [[Rasagiline]] is initiated at 1&nbsp;mg once-daily dosage as [[monotherapy]] in early PD patients and at 0.5–1&nbsp;mg once-daily as adjunctive to levodopa in advanced PD patients.<ref>[http://www.treatparkinson.com/ Treat Parkinson Disease Effectively] Retrieved on 2010-02-02</ref>

=== Neural transplantation ===
Since early in the eighties [[fetus|fetal]], [[pig|porcine]], [[Common carotid artery|carotid]] or [[retina]]l tissues have been used in cell transplants for PD patients.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>
Although there was initial evidence of [[Mesencephalon|mesencephalic]] dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, the [[Double-blind#Double-blind_trials|best constructed studies]] up to date indicate that cell transplants have no effect.<ref name="pmid20495568">{{cite journal |author=Obeso JA, Rodriguez-Oroz MC, Goetz CG, ''et al.'' |title=Missing pieces in the Parkinson's disease puzzle |journal=Nat Med |volume= 16|issue= 6|pages= 653–61|year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20495568 |doi=10.1038/nm.2165 |url=}}</ref> An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to [[dystonia]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Redmond DE |title=Cellular replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease--where we are today? |journal=The Neuroscientist |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=457–88 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12374430 |doi=10.1177/107385802237703}}</ref> [[Stem cell]]s transplants are a main research recent target: they are easy to manipulate and when transplanted into the brains of [[rodent]]s and [[monkey]]s cells survive and improve behavioral abnormalities of the animals.<ref name="pmid20495568"/><ref name="Science Daily">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061204123212.htm |title=Stem Cell Research Aims to Tackle Parkinson's Disease |accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> Nevertheless use of fetal stem cells is [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]].<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Some have proposed that such controversy may be overcome with the use of [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s from adults.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>
