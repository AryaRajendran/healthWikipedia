'''Transfusion-associated [[graft versus host disease]] (TA-GvHD)''' is a rare complication of [[blood transfusion]], in which the donor [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] mount an immune response against the recipient's lymphoid tissue.<ref name="urlComplications of Transfusion: Transfusion Medicine: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec11/ch146/ch146e.html#sec11-ch146-ch146d-1107 |title=Complications of Transfusion: Transfusion Medicine: Merck Manual Professional |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref> Donor lymphocytes are usually identified as foreign and destroyed by the recipient's immune system. However, in situations where the recipient is immunocompromised (inborn [[immunodeficiency]], acquired immunodeficiency, [[malignancy]]), or when the donor is homozygous and the recipient is heterozygous for an [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] [[haplotype]] (as can occur in directed donations from first-degree relatives), the recipient's immune system is not able to destroy the donor lymphocytes. This can result in [[graft versus host disease]].

==Epidemiology and pathogenesis==
The incidence in immunocompromised patients receiving blood transfusions is estimated to be 0.1 - 1.0%, mortality around 80 - 90%. Mortality is higher in TA-GvHD than in GvHD associated with [[bone marrow transplantation]], where the [[engraft]]ed lymphoid cells in the [[bone marrow]] are of donor origin; therefore, the immune reaction is not directed against them.

The most common [[cause of death]] in TA-GvHD is infections and hemorrhages, secondary to pancytopenia and liver dysfunction.

==Presentation and diagnosis==
===Clinical manifestations===
The clinical presentation is the same as GvHD occurring in other settings, such as bone marrow transplantation. TA-GvHD can develop four to thirty days after the transfusion. Typical symptoms include:
:*[[fever]]
:*erythematous [[maculopapular rash]], which can progress to generalised [[erythroderma]]
:*[[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] in extreme cases

Other symptoms can include cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, and profuse [[diarrhea]] (up to 8 [[liter]]s/day).

===Laboratory manifestations===
Laboratory findings include [[pancytopenia]], abnormal [[liver function tests|liver enzymes]], and electrolyte imbalance (when diarrhea is present).

===Diagnosis===
TA-GvHD can be suspected from a [[biopsy]] of the affected skin, and established by [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] analysis of the circulating lymphocytes. This testing can identify circulating lymphocytes with a different HLA type than the tissue cells of the host.

==Treatment and prevention==
'''Treatment''' is only supportive, as no available form of therapy has proven effective in treating TA-GvHD. 

'''Prevention''' includes [[gamma ray|gamma]] [[irradiation]] of the lymphocyte-containing blood products. This procedure should be performed in transfusions when:
:* The recipient is immunocompromised.
:* The blood components are from a family donor.
:* HLA-matched platelets are transferred.
Another means of prevention is the use of third- or fourth-generation [[leukoreduction]] filters, although the efficacy of this procedure has not yet been documented.
