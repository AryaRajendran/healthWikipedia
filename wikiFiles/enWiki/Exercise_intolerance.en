'''Exercise intolerance''' is a condition where the [[patient]] is unable to do [[physical exercise]] at the level or for the duration that would be expected of someone in his or her general [[physical body|physical]] condition, or experiences unusually severe post-exercise [[pain]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or other negative effects. Exercise intolerance is not a [[disease]] or [[syndrome]] in and of itself, but a [[symptom]]. 

Since there are many possible specific reasons why exercise could be inhibited, this is a rather slippery term.  For instance, the patient may experience unusual breathlessness ([[dyspnea]]), muscle pain ([[myalgia]]), or increasing muscle [[weakness (medical)|weakness]] while exercising, or may, after exercise, experience severe [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[dizziness]] or extreme fatigue. In most cases, the specific reason that exercise is not tolerated is of considerable significance when trying to isolate the cause down to a specific disease.

==Causes==
Exercise intolerance is primarily found in cardiorespiratory disorders. It is also a common symptom in [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. Several heart conditions, such as a [[cardiac arrhythmia]] (abnormal heart rate or rhythm) or an [[aortic valve insufficiency]], if severe enough can cause activity problems such as shortness of breath and/or exercise intolerance. People with acute back pain from an injury or chronic back pain (e.g., from a degenerative condition) may also experience exercise limitations due to muscle spasms or limited range of spinal motion. [[Overtraining]] and (undiagnosed) [[anemia]] can also cause the intolerance. Exercise intolerance may result from mutations in [[mitochondrial]] [[Coenzyme_Q_-_cytochrome_c_reductase|Complex III]], a complex of Co-enzyme Q10 ([[ubiquinol]]) and several proteins. Ubiquinol depletion caused by statin drug usage may also lead to muscle fatigue or exercise intolerance in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thibault|first=A|coauthors=et al.|title=Phase I study of lovastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, in patients with cancer|journal=Clin Cancer Res.|date=March 1996|year=1996|volume=2|issue=3|pages=483â€“91|pmid=9816194|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/2/3/483.full.pdf|accessdate=5/8/2012}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Exercise is key for many heart and back patients, and a variety of specific exercise techniques are available for both groups. Some exercise specialists are trained in modifications specific to these patients{{Who|date=August 2009}}. 

===Hazards===
Certain conditions in particular exist where exercise, particularly rehabilitation, may be contraindicated, including:

*decompensated heart failure
*recent [[myocardial infarction]]
*hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy from recent myocarditis
*active or suspected myocarditis or pericarditis
*low left ventricular ejection fraction
*severe aortic stenosis
*unstable ischemia
*unstable arrythmia
*irregular or resting pulse greater than 100 bpm
*resting systolic blood pressure >200&nbsp;mm Hg or resting diastolic blood pressure >110&nbsp;mm Hg
*severe pulmonary hypertension
*severe chronic fatigue syndrome
*suspected or known dissecting aneurysm
*recent systemic or pulmonary embolus
*pneumothorax and haemoptysis
*thrombophlebitis

Other conditions may also preclude exercising under certain conditions. Passive [[physiotherapy]] can in some instances be an alternative for some patients unable to safely self-power.
