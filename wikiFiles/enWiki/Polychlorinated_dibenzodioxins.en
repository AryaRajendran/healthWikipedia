'''Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins''' ('''PCDD'''s), or simply '''dioxins''', are a group of [[organic compounds|organic]] [[polyhalogenated compound]]s that are significant environmental [[pollutant]]s.   They are commonly but inaccurately referred to as dioxins for simplicity, because every PCDD [[molecule]] contains a [[1,4-Dioxin|dioxin]] skeletal structure as the central ring. This gives the molecule a [[Dibenzodioxin|dibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] ring system. Members of the PCDD family [[bioaccumulate]] in humans and [[wildlife]] because of their [[lipophilic]] properties, and may cause developmental disturbances and [[cancer]].

Dioxins occur as by-products in the manufacture of some [[organochlorine]]s, in the incineration of chlorine-containing substances such as [[PVC]] (polyvinyl chloride), in the chlorine bleaching of paper, and from natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires.<ref name="beychok1987">{{cite journal|author=Beychok, Milton R. |year=1987 |month=January |title=A data base for dioxin and furan emissions from refuse incinerators |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=29–36 |doi=10.1016/0004-6981(87)90267-8}}</ref> There have been many incidents of dioxin pollution resulting from industrial emissions and accidents; the earliest such incidents were in the mid 19th century during the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name="weber2008">{{cite journal | author=Weber R, Tysklind M, and Gaus C | title=Dioxin&nbsp;— Contemporary and future challenges of historical legacies (Editorial, dedicated to Otto Hutzinger) | journal=Env Sci Pollut Res | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=96–100 (p.97) | year=2008 | doi=10.1065/espr2008.01.473}}</ref>

The word "dioxins" may also refer to other similarly acting chlorinated compounds (see [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]]).

== Chemical structure of dibenzo-''p''-dioxins ==
[[File:Dibenzo-p-dioxin-numbering-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|200px|The [[skeletal formula]] and [[substituent]] numbering scheme of the parent compound [[Dibenzo-1,4-dioxin|dibenzo-''p''-dioxin]]]]

The structure of [[Dibenzo-1,4-dioxin|dibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] comprises two [[benzene ring]]s joined by two oxygen bridges. This makes the compound an [[aromatic]] di[[ether]]. The name dioxin formally refers to the central dioxygenated ring, which is stabilized by the two flanking [[benzene ring]]s.

In PCDDs, chlorine atoms are attached to this structure at any of 8 different places on the molecule, at positions 1–4 and 6–9. There are 75 different PCDD [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] (that is: related dioxin compounds).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7127/ Nomenclature and physico-chemical properties of PCDDs and PCDFs. In: Dioxins in the Environment: What are the health risks? INSERM Collective Expert Evaluation Reports (2000)]. Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (2011-03-18). Retrieved on 2011-06-09.</ref>

The toxicity of PCDDs depends on the number and positions of the chlorine atoms.  Congeners that have chlorines in the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions have been found to be significantly toxic. In fact, 7 congeners have chlorine atoms in the relevant positions which were considered toxic by the World Health Organization toxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) scheme.<ref name="pmid16829543">{{cite journal |author=Van den Berg M, Birnbaum LS, Denison M, ''et al'' |title=The 2005 World Health Organization reevaluation of human and Mammalian toxic equivalency factors for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds |journal=Toxicol.

== Historical perspective ==
[[File:Dioxin-2D-skeletal.svg|right|220px|thumb|Structure of ''2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin'' (TCDD)]]

Low concentrations of dioxins existed in nature prior to [[industrialization]] as a result of natural combustion and geological processes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/dioxin/pdf/task6.pdf |title= Compilation of EU Dioxin Exposure and Health Data |accessdate=2007-06-04 |format= PDF |work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/dioxinqa.html#g9 |title=FDA/CFSAN&nbsp;— Questions and Answers about Dioxins |accessdate=2007-06-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070601173236/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/dioxinqa.html#g9 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> Dioxins were first unintentionally produced as by-products from 1848 onwards as [[Leblanc process]] plants started operating in Germany.<ref name="weber2008"/> The first intentional synthesis of chlorinated dibenzodioxin was in 1872.

The most toxic dioxin, [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] (TCDD), became well known as a contaminant of [[Agent Orange]], a herbicide used in the Vietnam War.<ref name="pmid16445906">{{cite journal |author=Schecter A, Birnbaum L, Ryan JJ, Constable JD |title=Dioxins: an overview |journal=Environ.

== Sources of dioxins ==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] inventory of sources of dioxin-like compounds is possibly the most comprehensive review of the sources and releases of dioxins,<ref name="epaSources">[http://oaspub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=459709 An Inventory of Sources and Environmental Releases of Dioxin-Like Compounds in the U.S. for the Years 1987, 1995, and 2000] EPA/600/P-03/002f, Final Report, November 2006</ref> but other countries now have substantial research as well.

[[File:PCDD sediment core.svg|thumb|Concentration profile of PCDD in a dated sediment core from [[Esthwaite Water]], [[Cumbria]], [[UK]].]]

Occupational exposure is an issue for some in the chemical industries, historically for those making chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides or in the application of chemicals, notably [[herbicide]]s. In many developed nations there are now emissions regulations which have dramatically decreased the emissions<ref name="epaSources"/> and thus alleviated some concerns, although the lack of continuous sampling of dioxin emissions causes concern about the understatement of emissions. In [[Belgium]], through the introduction of a process called [[AMESA]], continuous sampling showed that periodic sampling understated emissions by a factor of 30 to 50 times. Few facilities have continuous sampling.

Dioxins are produced in small concentrations when organic material is burned in the presence of [[chlorine]], whether the chlorine is present as [[chloride]] [[ion]]s or as [[organochlorine compound]]s, so they are widely produced in many contexts. According to the most recent US EPA data, the major sources of dioxins are broadly in the following types:<ref name="epaSources"/>

*Combustion sources, e.g. municipal waste or medical waste incinerators and private backyard barrel burning
*Metal smelting
*Refining and process sources
*Chemical manufacturing sources
*Natural sources
*Environmental reservoirs

When first carried out in 1987, the original US EPA inventory of dioxin sources revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known dioxin sources. As a result, US EPA implemented new emissions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stack emissions from incinerators. Incineration of [[municipal solid waste]], [[medical waste]], [[sewage sludge]], and [[hazardous waste]] together now produce less than 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, and is now the largest source of dioxin emissions, producing about one third of the total output.<ref name="epaSources"/>

In incineration, dioxins can also reform or form ''de novo'' in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] above the stack as the exhaust gases cool through a temperature window of 600 to 200&nbsp;°C. The most common method of reducing the quantity of dioxins reforming or forming ''de novo'' is through rapid (30 millisecond) [[quenching]] of the exhaust gases through that 400 °C window.<ref name="pmid17410797">{{cite journal |author=Cheung WH, Lee VK, McKay G |title=Minimizing dioxin emissions from integrated MSW thermal treatment |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=2001–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17410797| doi = 10.1021/es061989d}}</ref> Incinerator emissions of dioxins have been reduced by over 90% as a result of new emissions control requirements. Incineration in developed countries is now a very minor contributor to dioxin emissions.

Dioxins are also generated in reactions that do not involve burning&nbsp;— such as chlorine bleaching fibers for paper or textiles, and in the manufacture of chlorinated phenols, particularly when reaction temperature is not well controlled.<ref>P.S. Kulkami, J.G. Crespo, C.A.M. Afonso: Dioxins sources and current remediation technologies - a review. Environment International 2008:34:139-153.</ref> Compounds involved include the wood preservative [[pentachlorophenol]], and also [[herbicide]]s such as [[2,4-D|2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (or 2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). Higher levels of chlorination require higher reaction temperatures and greater dioxin production. Dioxins may also be formed during the [[photochemical]] breakdown of the common antimicrobial compound [[triclosan]].<ref name="pmid15779749">{{cite journal |author=Latch DE, Packer JL, Stender BL, VanOverbeke J, Arnold WA, McNeill K |title=Aqueous photochemistry of triclosan: formation of 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and oligomerization products |journal=Environ.

==Sources of human intake==
[[File:Dioxin chart.png|thumb|400px|right|A chart illustrating how much dioxin the average American consumes per day. (Note: pg = picogram, or one trillionth of a gram, or 10<sup>−12</sup> g) .<ref name="pmid11346131"/>]]

Tolerable daily, monthly or annual intakes have been set by the [[World Health Organization]] and a number of governments. Dioxins enter the general population almost exclusively from ingestion of food, specifically through the consumption of fish, meat, and dairy products since dioxins are fat-soluble and readily climb the [[food chain]].<ref name="pmid11346131">{{cite journal |author=Schecter A, Cramer P, Boggess K, ''et al'' |title=Intake of dioxins and related compounds from food in the U.S. population |journal=J.

Rappe: Exposure of populations to dioxins and related compounds. Food Additives and Contaminants 2000:17:241-259.</ref>

Most controversial is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (US EPA) assessment's (draft) finding that any [[reference dose]] that were to be set would be far below current average intakes. This is based on linear extrapolation model of cancer risk, which is not generally accepted for chemicals promoting cancer caused by other factors rather than initiating the cancer by itself.<ref>Y.P.

Dioxins are also in typical [[Smoke constituents|cigarette smoke]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ball M, Paepke O, Lis A |title= Polychlordibenzodioxine und Polychlordibenzofurane in Cigarettenrauch |journal= Beitr.

In that same document, the US EPA acknowledged that dioxin in cigarettes is "anthropogenic" (man-made, "not likely in nature").

==Metabolism==
Dioxins are absorbed primarily through dietary intake of fat, as this is where they accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly chlorinated dioxins are stored in fatty tissues and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted. The estimated elimination [[half-life]] for highly chlorinated dioxins (4–8 chlorine atoms) in humans ranges from 4.9 to 13.1 years.<ref>Milbrath MO, Wenger Y, Chang C, Emond C, Garabrant D, Gillespie BW, Jolliet O. Apparent half-lives of dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls as a function of age, body fat, smoking status, and breast-feeding. Environmental Health Perspectives, 2009:117: 417-425</ref>

The persistence of a particular dioxin congener in an animal is thought to be a consequence of its structure. Dioxins with no lateral (2, 3, 7, and 8) chlorines, which thus contain hydrogen atoms on adjacent pairs of carbons, can more readily be oxidized by [[cytochrome P450|cytochromes P450]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The oxidized dioxins can then be more readily excreted rather than stored for a long time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

== Toxicity ==
[[File:Dioxin-3D-vdW.png|right|220px|thumb|[[Space-filling model]] of 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin.]]

[[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] (TCDD) is considered the most toxic of the [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]]s (for the mechanism of action, see [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] and [[Aryl hydrocarbon receptor]]). Other dioxin congeners including PCDFs and PCBs with dioxin-like toxicity, are given a toxicity rating from 0 to 1, where TCDD = 1 (see [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]]). This toxicity rating is called the Toxic Equivalence Factor concept, or [[TEF]]. TEFs are consensus values and, because of the strong species dependence for toxicity, are listed separately for mammals, fish, and birds. TEFs for mammalian species are generally applicable to human risk calculations. The TEFs have been developed from detailed assessment of literature data to facilitate both risk assessment and regulatory control.<ref name="pmid16829543"/> Many other compounds may also have dioxin-like properties, particularly non-ortho [[PCBs]], one of which has a TEF as high as 0.1.

The total dioxin toxic equivalence (TEQ) value expresses the toxicity as if the mixture were pure TCDD. The TEQ approach and current TEFs have been adopted internationally as the most appropriate way to estimate the potential health risks of mixture of dioxins. Recent data suggest that this type of simple scaling factor may not be the most appropriate treatment for complex mixtures of dioxins; both transfer from the source and absorption and elimination vary among different congeners, and the TEF value is not able to accurately reflect this.<ref>Tuomisto, J. The toxic equivalency principle and its application in dioxin risk assessment. In: R. Pohjanvirta (editor): The AH Receptor in Biology and Toxicology. Wiley, 2011. ISBN 978-0-470-60182-2.</ref>

Dioxins and other [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) are subject to the [[Stockholm Convention]]. The [[treaty]] obliges signatories to take measures to eliminate where possible, and minimize where not possible to eliminate, all sources of dioxin.

== Health effects in humans ==
[[File:Chloracne-in-herbicide-worker.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Chloracne]] on the ear and neck of a [[herbicide]] production worker.]]
Dioxins build up primarily in fatty tissues over time ([[bioaccumulate]]), so even small exposures may eventually reach dangerous levels. In 1994, the US EPA reported that dioxins are a probable [[carcinogen]], but noted that non-cancer effects (reproduction and sexual development, immune system) may pose a greater threat to human health. [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]], the most toxic of the dibenzodioxins, is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC). TCDD has a half-life of approximately 8 years in humans, although at high concentrations, the elimination rate is enhanced by metabolism.<ref name="pmid12107649">{{cite journal |author=Geusau A, Schmaldienst S, Derfler K, Päpke O, Abraham K |title=Severe 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) intoxication: kinetics and trials to enhance elimination in two patients |journal=Arch.

Recent studies have shown that high exposure to dioxins changes the ratio of male to female births among a population such that more females are born than males.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN1836384520071018?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews |title=Dioxin pollution leads to more baby girls -study |work= Reuters |accessdate=2007-10-22 | date=2007-10-18}}</ref>

Dioxins accumulate in food chains in a fashion similar to other chlorinated compounds ([[bioaccumulation]]). This means that even small concentrations in contaminated water can be concentrated up a food chain to dangerous levels because of the long biological half life and low water solubility of dioxins.

== Toxic effects in animals ==
While it has been difficult to establish specific health effects in humans due to the lack of controlled dose experiments, studies in animals have shown that dioxin causes a wide variety of toxic effects.<ref name=Pohjanvirta>R. Pohjanvirta, J. Tuomisto, Short-term toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop- dioxin in laboratory animals: effects, mechanisms, and animal models, Pharmacological Reviews 1994: 46: 483–549.</ref> In particular, [[Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] (see this) has been shown to be [[teratogenic]], [[mutagenic]], [[carcinogenic]], [[immunotoxic]], and [[hepatotoxic]]. Furthermore, alterations in multiple [[endocrine]] and [[growth factor]] systems have been reported. The most sensitive effects, observed in multiple species, appear to be developmental, including effects on the developing [[immune]], [[nervous]], and [[reproductive]] systems.<ref name="pmid10912242">{{cite journal |author=Birnbaum LS, Tuomisto J |title=Non-carcinogenic effects of TCDD in animals |journal=Food additives and contaminants |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=275–88 |year=2000 |pmid=10912242 |doi=10.1080/026520300283351}}</ref> The most sensitive effects are caused at [[body burden]]s relatively close to those reported in humans.

The LD50 of dioxin also varies wildly between species with the most notable disparity being between the ostensibly similar species of hamster and guinea pig. The oral LD50 for guinea pigs is as low as 0.5 to 2 μg/Kg body weight, whereas the oral LD50 for hamsters can be as high as 1 to 5&nbsp;mg/Kg body weight, a difference of as much as thousandfold or more, and even among rat strains there may be thousandfold differences.<ref name=Pohjanvirta/>

[[File:US-Huey-helicopter-spraying-Agent-Orange-in-Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. Army [[Huey helicopter]] spraying [[Agent Orange]] over Vietnamese agricultural land]]
{{Main|Agent Orange}}
Agent Orange was the code name for one of the [[herbicide]]s and [[defoliant]]s used by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] as part of its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]], during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1961 to 1971.

A 50:50 mixture of [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]], it was manufactured for the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] primarily by [[Monsanto Corporation]] and [[Dow Chemical]]. The [[2,4,5-T]] used to produce Agent Orange was later discovered to be contaminated with [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]], an extremely toxic [[dioxin compound]]. It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped [[Drum (container)|55 US gallon (200 L) barrels]] in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called "[[Rainbow Herbicides]]".<ref name="hay-1982-p151">Hay, 1982: [http://books.google.com/books?id=V524J4zh06MC&pg=PA151 p. 151]</ref>

During the Vietnam war, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed {{convert|20000000|USgal|L|sigfig=2}} of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of [[Operation Ranch Hand]].<ref name="pellow-2007-159">Pellow, David N.

The US began to target food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]. In 1965, 42% of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops.<ref name="kolko-144-145" /> Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the destruction and [[famine]] in the countryside by fleeing to the U.S.-dominated cities. The urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled: from 2.8 million people in 1958, to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled [[urbanization]]; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in [[Saigon]] [[slums]], while many South Vietnamese elites and U.S. personnel lived in luxury.<ref name="pp. 4">Luong, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&pg=PA4 pp. 4]</ref>

According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange, resulting in 400,000 people being killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with [[birth defects]].<ref name="last-ghost">York,Geoffrey; Mick, Hayley; [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080711.worange1107/BNStory/Front/home/?pageRequested=all "Last Ghost of the Vietnam War"], ''The Globe and Mail'', July 12, 2008</ref>

* Between 1965 and 1968 production of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol in [[Spolana]] [[Neratovice]] plant in [[Czechoslovakia]] seriously poisoned about 60 workers with dioxins; after 3 years of investigations of the health problems of workers, Spolana stopped manufacture of 2,4,5-T (most of which was supplied to the US military in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]).

* Also during 1965 through 1968, [[Albert Kligman|Dr. Albert M. Kligman]] was contracted by the Dow Chemical Company to perform threshold tests for TCDD on inmates at [[Holmesburg Prison]] in [[Philadelphia]] after Dow studies revealed adverse effects on workers at Dow's [[Midland, Michigan]] plant were likely due to TCDD.  A subsequent test by Dow in rabbit ear models when exposed to 4–8μg usually caused a severe response.  The human studies carried out in Holmesburg failed to follow Dow's original protocol and lacked proper informed consent by the participants.

* Explosions resulting from the terrorist attacks on the US on [[September 11, 2001]], released massive amounts of dust into the air. The air was measured for dioxins from September 23, 2001, to November 21, 2001, and reported to be "likely the highest ambient concentration that have ever been reported [in history]." The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] report dated October 2002 and released in December 2002 titled "Exposure and Human Health Evaluation of Airborne Pollution from the World Trade Center Disaster" authored by the EPA Office of Research and Development in Washington states that dioxin levels recorded at a monitoring station on [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]] near [[New York City Hall|City Hall Park]] in [[New York City|New York]] between October 12 and 29, 2001, averaged 5.6 parts per trillion, or nearly six times the highest dioxin level ever recorded in the U.S. Dioxin levels in the rubble of the [[World Trade Centers]] were much higher with concentrations ranging from 10 to 170 parts per trillion. The report did no measuring of the toxicity of indoor air.

* In a 2001 case study,<ref name="pmid11564625"/> physicians reported clinical changes in a 30-year-old woman who had been exposed to a massive dosage (144,000 pg/g blood fat) of dioxin equal to 16,000 times the normal body level; the highest dose of dioxin ever recorded in a human. She suffered from [[chloracne]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[epigastric]] pain, [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[leukocytosis]], [[anemia]], [[amenorrhoea]] and [[thrombocytopenia]]. However, other notable laboratory tests, such as immune function tests, were relatively normal. The same study also covered a second subject who had received a dosage equivalent to 2,900 times the normal level, who apparently suffered no notable negative effects other than chloracne. These patients were provided with [[olestra]] to accelerate dioxin elimination.<ref name="pmid10520643">{{cite journal |author=Geusau A, Tschachler E, Meixner M, ''et al'' |title=Olestra increases faecal excretion of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9186 |pages=1266–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10520643| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04271-3}}</ref>

[[File:Viktor Yuschenko.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Yushchenko]] with chloracne after his TCDD poisoning incident]]
* In 2004, in a notable individual case of dioxin poisoning, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician [[Viktor Yushchenko]] was exposed to the second-largest measured dose of dioxins, according to the reports of the physicians responsible for diagnosing him.

* In the early 2000s, residents of the city of [[New Plymouth]], [[New Zealand]], reported many illnesses of people living around and working at the Dow Chemical plant. This plant ceased production of 2,4,5-T in 1987.

* DuPont has been sued by 1,995 people who claim dioxin emissions from DuPont's plant in [[DeLisle, Mississippi]], caused their cancers, illnesses or loved ones' deaths; of these only 850 were pending as of June 2008. In August 2005, Glen Strong, an [[oyster]] fisherman with the rare blood cancer [[multiple myeloma]], was awarded $14 million from DuPont, but the ruling was overturned June 5, 2008, by a [[Mississippi]] jury who found DuPont's plant had no connection to Mr. Strong's disease.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.netscape.cnn.com/news_story.jsp?idq=/ff/story/0001/20080605/1630797316.htm&TickerSymbols=DD |title=Miss. jury rules for DuPont in $14m dioxin case |accessdate=2008-08-22 |work=CNN}}</ref> In another case, parents claimed dioxin from pollution caused the death of their 8-year-old daughter; the trial took place in the summer of 2007, and a jury wholly rejected the family's claims, as no scientific connection could be proven between DuPont and the family's tragic loss.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2007/06/12/80735.htm |title=Jury Finds DuPont Dioxins Not Responsible for Child's Death |accessdate=2008-08-22 |work=}}</ref> DuPont's DeLisle plant is one of three [[titanium dioxide]] facilities (including [[Edgemoor, Delaware]], and [[New Johnsonville, Tennessee]]) that are the largest producers of dioxin in the country, according to the US EPA's Toxic Release Inventory.

* In 2007, thousands of tonnes of foul-smelling refuse were piled up in [[Naples]], Italy and its surrounding villages, defacing entire neighbourhoods. Authorities discovered that Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins levels in buffalo milk used by 29 mozzarella makers exceeded permitted limits, after further investigation they impounded milk from 66 farms. Authorities suspected the source of the contamination was from waste illegally disposed of on land grazed by buffalo. Prosecutors in Naples placed 109 people under investigation on suspicion of fraud and food poisoning. Sales of Mozzarella cheese fell by 50% in Italy.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/italys-toxic-waste-crisis-the-mafia-ndash-and-the-scandal-of-europes-mozzarella-799289.html?service=Print |title=Italy's toxic waste crisis, the Mafia – and the scandal of Europe's mozzarella |accessdate=2008-03-28 |work=The Independent | location=London | first1=Michael | last1=McCarthy | first2=John | last2=Phillips | date=2008-03-22}}</ref>

* In December 2008 in [[Ireland]] dioxin levels in [[pork]] were disclosed to have been between 80 and 200 times the legal limit. All Irish pork products were withdrawn from sale both nationally and internationally.{{Main|Irish pork crisis of 2008}} In this case the dioxin toxicity was found to be mostly due to dioxin-like polychlorinated [[dibenzofurans]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], and the contribution from actual polychlorinated dibenzodioxins was relatively low. It is thought that the incident resulted from the contamination of [[fuel oil]] used in a drying burner at a single feed processor, with PCBs. The resulting combustion produced a highly toxic mixture of PCBs, dioxins and [[furan]]s, which was included in the feed produced and subsequently fed to a large number of pigs.<ref>[http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/publications/2010/DioxinReport211209revised190110.pdf Report Inter-Agency Review Group Dioxin (Dec 2008)].

* According to the last available data,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tarantosociale.org/tarantosociale/docs/2000.pdf |format=PDF| title=Peacelink|accessdate=2009-01-31 |work=}}</ref> in 2005 the production of dioxin by the steel industry ILVA in [[Taranto]] ([[Italy]]) accounted for 90.3 per cent of the overall Italian emissions, and 8.8 per cent of the European emissions.

* German dioxin incidence: In January 2011 about 4700 German farms were banned from making deliveries after self-checking of an animal feed producer had showed levels of dioxin above maximum levels.  This incident appeared to involve PCDDs and not PCBs.<ref name="eu"/> Dioxins were found in animal feed and eggs in many farms. The maximum values were exceeded twofold in feed and maximally fourfold in some individual eggs.<ref name=eu/> Thus the incident was minor as compared with the Belgian crisis in 1999, and delivery bans were rapidly cleared.<ref name=germany>http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/dioxin_germany_information_note_en.pdf</ref>

==Dioxin testing==
The analyses used to determine these compounds' relative toxicity share common elements that differ from methods used for more traditional analytical determinations. The preferred methods for dioxins and related analyses use high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Concentrations are determined by measuring the ratio of the analyte to the appropriate isotopically labeled internal standard.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/fem/methcollectns.htm Method Collections | Measurement Science | Office of the Science Advisor | US EPA].

* Polychlorinated [[dibenzofurans]] (PCDFs) – A group of compounds, produced by the same conditions as dioxins and commonly co-present with dioxins in contamination incidents.  They have the same toxic mode of action and are included in the [[toxic equivalent]] scheme for the purposes of assessing dioxin levels.
