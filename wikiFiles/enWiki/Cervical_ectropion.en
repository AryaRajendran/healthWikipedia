'''Cervical ectropion''' (or '''cervical eversion''') is a condition in which the central (endocervical) columnar epithelium protrudes out through the [[External orifice of the uterus|external os]] of the [[cervix]] and onto the [[vaginal portion of cervix|vaginal portion of the cervix]], undergoes [[squamous metaplasia]], and transforms to stratified squamous epithelium.<ref>Katz: Comprehensive Gynecology, 5th Edition.</ref>  Although not an abnormality, it is indistinguishable from early [[cervical cancer]]; therefore, further diagnostic studies (e.g., [[Pap smear]], biopsy) must be performed for a differential diagnosis.<ref>Mosby's Guide to Physical Examination, 7th Edition.  Page 558.</ref>

==Formation==
The squamocolumnar junction, where the columnar secretory epithelium of the [[endocervical canal]] meets the stratified squamous covering of the ectocervix, is located at the external os before puberty. As [[estrogen]] levels rise during puberty, the cervical os opens, exposing the endocervical columnar epithelium onto the ectocervix.  This area of columnar cells on the ectocervix forms an area that is red and raw in appearance called an ectropion (cervical erosion).  It is then exposed to the acidic environment of the [[vagina]] and, through a process of [[squamous metaplasia]], transforms into stratified squamous epithelium.<ref>Standring: Gray's Anatomy, 40th ed.</ref>

==Causes==
Cervical ectropion is a normal phenomenon, especially in the ovulatory phase in younger women, during pregnancy, and in women taking the [[oral contraceptive]] pill, which increases the total estrogen level in the body.<ref>Standring: Gray's Anatomy, 40th ed.</ref> It also may be a congenital problem by persistence of the squamocolumnar junction which is normally present prior to birth.  Additionally, it can be caused by scarring of the external os during vaginal intercourse.

[[Mucopurulent cervicitis]] may increase the size of the cervical ectropion.<ref>Bope: Conn's Current Therapy 2011, 1st Edition.</ref>

==Symptoms==
Cervical ectropion can be associated with excessive but non-[[purulent]] vaginal discharge due to the increased surface area of [[columnar epithelium]] containing mucus-secreting glands. It may also give rise to post-[[coitus|coital]] bleeding, as fine blood vessels present within the columnar epithelium are easily traumatised.

==Treatment==
Usually no treatment is indicated for clinically asymptomatic cervical ectropions. Hormonal therapy may be indicated for symptomatic erosion. If it becomes troublesome to the patient, it can be treated by discontinuing oral contraceptives, or by using ablation treatment under local anaesthetic. Ablation involves using a preheated probe (100 degrees Celsius) to destroy 3&ndash;4mm of the epithelium. In [[post-partum]] erosion, observation and re-examination are necessary for 3 months after labour.
