'''Pulmonary angiography''' (or '''pulmonary arteriography''') is a [[cardiology|cardiological]] [[medicine|medical]] procedure.   Pulmonary [[blood vessel]]s are [[X-ray#Medical uses|x-rayed]] to detect [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.

Direct angiography is the injection of [[radiocontrast]] into the circulation with subsequent [[fluoroscopy]] (direct X-ray visualisation) of the lungs. A more common form of direct angiography, is the catheterisation of the right atrium of the heart and injection of radiocontrast into the right heart.

A popular form of pulmonary angiography is ''[[computed tomography]] pulmonary angiography'' ([[CTPA]]). This involves venous contrast only.

Invasive pulmonary angiography was first performed in 1931 by [[Egas Moniz]] and colleagues.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Moniz E, Carvalho L, Lima A | title=Angiopneumographie | journal=Presse Med | year=1931 | volume=39 | pages=996â€“99}}</ref> Robb and Steinberg described pulmonary angiography by infusion of peripheral radiocontrast.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Robb GP, Steinberg I | title=A practical method of visualization of the chambers of the heart, the pulmonary circulation, and the great blood vessels in man | journal=J Clin Invest | year=1938 | volume=17 | pages=507 | pmc=434806|doi=10.1172/JCI100977}}</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mgl9G8oU1IkC&pg=PA566</ref>
