'''Diffuse lamellar keratitis''' (DLK) is a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[inflammation]] of the [[cornea]] which may occur after [[refractive surgery]], such as [[LASIK]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hagele |first=Glenn |url=http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/lasik-intralasik-dlk.htm |title=Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis - DLK and Lasik, Bladeless Lasik, Sands of Sahara |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref>  Its incidence has been estimated to be 1 in 500 patients,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refractivesource.com/patients/complications/dlk.htm |title=Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis (DLK) â€“ |publisher=Refractivesource.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref> though this may be as high as 32% in some cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasikcomplications.com/dlk.htm |title=DLK - Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis |publisher=LASIK Complications |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
DLK is predominantly associated with Lasik, as the creation of a flap creates a potential space for cells to accumulate. Individuals with [[atopy|atopic conditions]] with pre-existing [[allergic conjunctivitis]], or [[ocular rosacea]], are more prone to developing the condition after surgery. Some authors have reported that moderate to severe eye allergies and chronic allergic conjunctivitis are an absolute contraindication to the LASIK procedure.<ref>{{Cite pmid|21822133}}</ref> This is in distinction to findings of earlier studies.<ref>{{Cite pmid|11566533 }}</ref> Keratitis can also occur after [[photorefractive keratectomy]] (PRK), although because it occurs in the setting of infection, it is distinct from the sterile [[white blood cell|infiltrates]] of DLK.<ref>{{cite pmid|23275825}}</ref> DLK can also occur following [[myopia|myopic]] keratomileusis, in which a disc of corneal tissue is removed, shaped and sutured back into place, although this technique is more historical, having been replaced by Lasik and PRK.<ref>{{Cite pmid|9754183 }}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients typically present within one week of surgery with eye pain, [[photophobia]], [[conjunctivitis]], or excessive tear production.

== Pathology ==
DLK is usually seen after refractive surgery.  [[Neutrophil granulocyte|Neutrophils]] infiltrate the corneal [[stroma of cornea|stroma]] in a diffuse, multifocal pattern.  Infiltration is confined to the surgical flap interface with no posterior or anterior extension, and overlying epithelium most often remains intact.  As it is a sterile process, cultures based on swab tests are negative.

== Stages ==
There are 4 stages of disease, with stage 4 being the rarest and most severe.

* '''Stage 1''' Cells infiltrate the periphery of the flap, without involving central cornea. 
* '''Stage 2''' Peripheral cells migrate to the center of the cornea, and impair vision; presentation is usually 2 to 3 days after surgery.
* '''Stage 3''' Cells at the central cornea form clumps of dense cell aggregates.
* '''Stage 4''' Otherwise known as central toxic keratopathy, stage 4 characteristically has no inflammatory cells at the anterior chamber or cornea, but there is central stromal necrosis, and the cornea becomes opacified; onset is usually 3 to 9 days after refractive surgery.<ref>{{cite pmid|23231367}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Depending on severity, therapies may range from topical or oral anti-inflammatories to irrigation and surgical repair.
