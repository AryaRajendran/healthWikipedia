The '''General Medical Council''' ('''GMC''') is a fee-based registered [[Charitable organization|charity]]<ref>[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Library/start/gmc.pdf Application for registration as a charity by the General Medical Council - 2 April 2001]</ref> with statutory obligation to maintain a register of [[physician|medical practitioners]] within the [[United Kingdom]]. The current chair of the council is [[Peter Rubin|Professor Sir Peter Rubin]] and current chief executive and registrar is [[Niall Dickson]].

==History==
{{main|History of medical regulation in the UK}}

The GMC was established by the [[Medical Act 1858]].

==Purpose==
All the GMC's functions derive from a statutory requirement for the establishment and maintenance of a register, which is the definitive list of doctors as provisionally or fully "registered medical practitioners", within the public sector in Britain.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/about/legislation/medical_act.asp#1] - GMC website.</ref> The GMC controls entry to the List of Registered Medical Practitioners ("the medical register"). The Medical Act 1983 (amended) notes that, "The main objective of the General Council in exercising their functions is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public."<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/about/legislation/medical_act.asp#1.</ref>
 
Secondly, the GMC regulates and sets the standards for [[Medical school (United Kingdom)|medical schools in the UK]], and liaises with other nations' medical and university regulatory bodies over medical schools overseas, leading to some qualifications being mutually recognised. Since 2010, it also regulates postgraduate medical education.

Thirdly, the GMC is responsible for a licensing and revalidation system for all practising doctors in the UK, separate from the registration system, which was given legal effect by order of the Privy Council on 3rd December 2012.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/LtP_and_Reval_Regs_2012.pdf_50435434.pdf] - GMC website.</ref>

==Activities and powers==
Due to the [[Medical ethics|principle of autonomy and law of consent]] there is no legislative restriction on who can treat patients or provide medical or health-related services. In other words, it is not a criminal offence to provide what would be considered medical assistance or treatment to another person – and not just in an emergency. This is in contrast with the position in respect of animals, where it is a criminal offence under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 for someone who is not a registered veterinary surgeon (or in certain more limited circumstances a registered veterinary nurse) to provide treatment (save in an emergency) to an animal.<ref>{{cite book | author=Grubb A, Laing J, McHale J | title=Principles of Medical Law | pages=88 | isbn=0-19-954440-9 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2011}}</ref>

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], since the enactment of the 1858 Act, has conferred on the GMC powers to grant various legal benefits and responsibilities to those medical practitioners who are registered with the GMC - a public body and association, as described, of the Medical Act of 1983, by Mr Justice Burnett in [[British Medical Association]] v General Medical Council.
 
{{cquote|Registration brings with it the privileges, as they are described, set out in Part 6 of the Act.  In reality, they comprise prohibitions for all those not registered. Section 46 prohibits any person from recovering in a court of law any charge rendered for medical advice, attendance or surgery unless he is registered. Section 47 provides that only those registered can act as physicians, surgeons or medical officers in any NHS hospital, prison, in the armed forces or other public institutions. Section 48 invalidates certificates, such as sick notes or prescriptions, if signed by someone who is unregistered. Section 49 imposes penalties via criminal offences for pretending to be a registered medical practitioner.<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/2602.html British Medical Association, R (on the application of) v General Medical Council &#91;2008&#93; EWHC 2602 (Admin) (3 October 2008) ]</ref>}}
Through which, by an Order in the Privy Council,<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3135/part/I/made/data.pdf The Medical Act 1983 (Amendment) Order 2002]</ref> the GMC describes "The main objective of the General Council in exercising their functions is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public".

The GMC is funded by annual fees required from those wishing to remain registered and fees for examinations. Fees for registration have risen significantly in the last few years: 2007 fees = £290, 2008 fees = £390, 2009 fees = £410, 2010 fees = £420, 2011 fees = £420, with a 50% discount for doctors earning under £26,000.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/fees.asp GMC website – fees]</ref><ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/8397.asp GMC website – press release – Fees cut for newly qualified doctors]</ref> 

In 2011, following the Command Paper "Enabling Excellence-Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers", registration fees were reduced by the GMC in accordance with the Government's strategy for reforming and simplifying the system for regulating healthcare workers in the UK and social workers and social care workers in England and requiring that <ref>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124374.pdf Enabling Excellence Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers - para 1.7]</ref> "[A]t a time of pay restraint in both the public and private sectors, the burden of fees on individual registrants needs to be minimised."

===Registering doctors in the UK===

{{cquote|The GMC maintains a register of medical practitioners. However, no law expressly prohibits any unregistered or unqualified person from practicing most types of medicine or even surgery. A criminal offence is committed only when such a person deliberately and falsely represents himself as being a registered practitioner or as having a medical qualification. The rationale of the criminal law is that people should be free to opt for any form of advice or treatment, however bizarre…<ref>{{cite book |author=Cave, Emma; Brazier, Margaret |title=Medicine, patients and the law |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=6 |isbn=0-14-103020-8 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JFgdAQAAMAAJ}}</ref>}}
Registration with the GMC confers a number of privileges and duties.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/information_for_doctors/privileges.asp GMC website – responsibilities and privileges of registered doctors]</ref> GMC registration may be either provisional or full. Provisional registration is granted to those who have completed medical school and enter their first year (F1) of medical training; this may be converted into full registration upon satisfactory completion of the first year of postgraduate training.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/education/postgraduate/foundation_programme.asp GMC website – the Foundation programme]</ref> In the past, a third type of registration ("limited registration") was granted to foreign graduates who had completed the [[Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test|Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board]] examination but required a period of work in the UK before their registration could be converted to "full". Limited registration was abolished on 19 October 2007 and now international medical graduates can apply for provisional or full registration depending on their level of experience – they still have to meet the GMC’s requirement for knowledge and skills and for English language.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/before_you_apply/imgs.asp GMC website – information for international medical graduates]</ref>

The GMC administers the [[Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test]] (PLAB), which has to be sat by non-[[European Union]] overseas doctors before they may practice medicine in the UK as a registered doctor.

A registered practitioner found to have committed some offences can be removed ("struck off") from the Medical Register.

===Licensing and revalidating doctors in the UK===

The GMC is now empowered to license and regularly revalidate the practice of doctors in the UK. When the licensing scheme was introduced in 2009, 13,500 (6.1%) of registered doctors chose not to be licensed.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/4893.asp] - GMC website.</ref> Unlicensed but registered doctors are likely to be non-practising lecturers, managers, or practising overseas<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/Patient_leaflet__Low_res___English_Version__28153330.pdf] - GMC website - patients and carers guide.</ref>, or retired. Whereas all registered doctors in the UK were offered a one-off automatic practise license in November 2009, since December 2012 no license will be automatically revalidated, but will be subject to a revalidation process every five years.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/revalidation.asp] - GMC website - revalidation.</ref> No doctor may now be registered for the first time without also being issued a license to practice<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/GMC_briefing_on_licensing_for_overseas_medical_regulators_16_November_2009_V2.pdf_34006572.pdf] - GMC website - overseas regulators briefing.</ref>, although a licensed doctor may give up their licence if they choose. No unlicensed but registered doctor in the UK is subject to revalidation. However, unlicensed but registered doctors in the UK are still subject to fitness-to-practice proceedings, and required to follow the GMC's good medical practice guidance.

===Setting standards of good medical practice===

The GMC sets standards of professional and ethical conduct that doctors in the UK are required to follow. The main guidance that the GMC provides for doctors is called Good Medical Practice.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/news_consultation/20477.asp Good Medical Practice] - GMC website.</ref>  This outlines the standard of professional conduct that the public expects from its doctors and provides principles that underpin the GMC’s fitness to practise decisions. Originally written in 1995, a revised edition came into force in November 2006, and another with effect from 22 April 2013. The content of Good Medical Practice has been rearranged into four domains of duties. Their most significant change is the replacement of a duty to, "Act without delay if you have good reason to believe that you or a colleague may be putting patients at risk," to a new duty to, "Take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is being compromised". Alongside the guidance booklet are a range of explanatory guidelines, including a new one one about the use of social media. The GMC also provides additional guidance for doctors on specific ethical topics, such as treating patients under the age of 18, end of life care, and conflicts of interest.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance.asp GMC website – ethical guidance]</ref>

===Medical education===

The GMC regulates medical education and training in the United Kingdom. It runs 'quality assurance' programmes for UK medical schools and postgraduate [[Deanery (NHS)|deaneries]] to ensure that the necessary standards and outcomes are achieved.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/education/index.asp GMC website – education]</ref>

In February 2008 the then [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Alan Johnson]], agreed with recommendations of the Tooke Report<ref>[http://www.mmcinquiry.org.uk/index.htm Tooke Report website]</ref> which advised that the [[Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board]] should be assimilated into the GMC.<ref>[http://www.mmcinquiry.org.uk/Final_8_Jan_08_MMC_all.pdf Tooke Report] Recommendation 30, p. 145</ref>  Whilst recognising the achievements made by PMETB, [[John Tooke|Professor John Tooke]] concluded that regulation needed to be combined into one body; that there should be one organisation that looked after what he called 'the continuum of medical education', from the moment someone chooses a career in medicine until the point that they retire. The merger, which took effect on 1 April 2010, was welcomed by both PMETB and the GMC.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/6583.asp GMC website – press release – New era for medical education and training]</ref>

===Concerns about doctors===

A registered medical practitioner may be referred to the GMC if there are doubts about their fitness to practise in the UK. These are divided into concerns about health and other concerns about ability or behaviour. In the past these issues were dealt with separately and differently, but now pass through a single fitness to practise process.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/reforms/transitional_arrangements_FAQ.asp Transitional arrangements] - FAQ on GMC website.</ref> The GMC has powers to issue advice or warnings to doctors, accept undertakings from them, or refer them to a fitness to practise panel. The GMC’s fitness to practise panels can accept undertakings from a doctor, issue warnings, impose conditions on a doctor’s practice, suspend a doctor, or erase them from the medical register ('struck off').<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/hearings_and_decisions/fitness_to_practise_panels.asp GMC website – Fitness to Practise panels]</ref> The GMC is concerned with ensuring that doctors are safe to practise. Its role is not, for example, to fine doctors or to compensate patients following problems.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/complaints_and_role_of_the_gmc.asp GMC Website – Complaints and the role of the GMC]</ref> The outcomes of hearings are made available on the GMC website.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/hearings_and_decisions/fitness_to_practise_decisions.asp GMC website – Decisions]</ref>

==Reform==
Since 2001, the GMC has itself become answerable to the [[Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence]] (CHRE), which oversees GMC activity and may challenge fitness to practise verdicts which it considers too lenient.<ref>[https://www.chre.org.uk/overseeingregulators/306/ CHRE website – Final fitness to practise decisions]</ref>

The GMC is also accountable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] through the Health Select Committee. In its first report on the GMC, the Committee described the GMC as "a high-performing medical regulator", but called for some changes to fitness to practise rules and practices, including allowing the GMC the right to appeal verdicts of its panels which it considers too lenient.<ref>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/health-committee/news/11-07-26-nmcreportpublished/</ref>

In the 2000s, the GMC implemented wide-ranging reforms of its organisation and procedures. In part, such moves followed [[Harold Shipman|the Shipman affair]]. They followed a direction set by the UK government in its white paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety.<ref>http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7013/7013.pdf</ref> One of the key changes was to reduce the size of the Council itself, and changing its composition to an equal number of medical and lay members, rather than the majority being doctors.<ref>http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/1517.asp GMC press release - GMC Council appointments</ref>

In 2011, the GMC proposed further changes to separate its role in investigating cases from its role in managing doctors' hearings by establishing a new body to run hearings, to be called the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.<ref>http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/10151.asp GMC press release - New tribunal service for doctors gets the go-ahead</ref> The GMC had previously been subject to criticism for combining these two roles under one roof.<ref>http://www.hospitaldr.co.uk/blogs/our-news/gmc-to-retain-adjudication-on-fitness-to-practise</ref>

A forthcoming reform to medical registration is the introduction of [[revalidation]] of doctors, more similar to the periodic process common in American states, in which the professional is expected to prove his or her professional development and skills. Revalidation is scheduled to start in 2012.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/8054.asp GMC website – Revalidation date set for 2012]</ref>

On 16 February 2011, The [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Andrew Lansley]], made a Written Ministerial Statement in the Justice section entitled ‘Health Care Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers’ in which he said:<ref>[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wms/?id=2011-02-16a.85WS.1 Health Care Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers - Hansard source (Citation: HC Deb, 16 February 2011, c85WS)]</ref>

{{cquote|I have today laid before Parliament a Command Paper, "Enabling Excellence-Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers" (Cm 8008) <ref>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124374.pdf Enabling Excellence Autonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workers]</ref> setting out the Government's proposals for how the system for regulating health care workers across the United Kingdom and social workers in England should be reformed.}}  
Within the Command Paper:- {{cquote|Should any regulators wish to propose mergers with other regulatory bodies to reduce costs as part of this work, the Government will view these proposals sympathetically. If the sector itself is unable to identify and secure significant cost reductions over the next three years, and contain registration fees, then the Government will revisit the issue of consolidating the sector into a more cost-effective configuration.}}
[[Liam Donaldson|Sir Liam Donaldson]], a former chief medical officer had recently told the [[Stafford Hospital scandal|Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust public inquiry]] that he had been involved in discussions about the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] merging with the General Medical Council, but proponents had "backed off" from the idea and the [[Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence]] was created instead to share best practice. Sir Liam said the CHRE had been "reasonably successful" but it would be "worth looking at the possibility of a merger" between the GMC and NMC.<ref>[http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/clinical-subjects/patient-safety/nurses-see-patients-as-diseased-objects/5035392.article Nurses see patients as 'diseased objects' Nursing Times 23 September 2011]</ref>

==Criticism==

===Self-regulation and complaints handling===
Due to its nature the GMC is positioned between the medical profession and the public, and has drawn criticism from both sides - from professionals for being unduly harsh in its decisions on fitness to practise and from the public for being too lenient.

Concern has also resulted from several studies which have shown that GMC handling of complaints appear to differ depending on race or "overseas qualification", but it has been suggested that this might be due to indirect factors.<ref>Simon Bowers. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/racism/Story/0,,349543,00.html GMC cleared of race bias charge]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2002-08-02. Accessed 2006-09-21.</ref>

The mortality and morbidity amongst doctors going through these procedures has attracted attention. In 2003/4 between 4 and 5% of doctors undergoing Fitness to Practice scrutiny died.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/5b___Report_of_the_Health_Review__Final_.pdf_25399045.pdf Health Review Group report, May 2005, p. 50]</ref> In response to a request for information in accordance with the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], the GMC revealed that 68 doctors had died recently whilst undergoing a fitness to practice investigation,<ref>[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/57592/response/148232/attach/html/2/DOC001.PDF.pdf.html Deaths during GMC investigation - 4 February 2011]</ref> fuelling doubts about the hearings and sanctions being proportionate and fair.

In a warning on 'over-regulation', the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]] chair Dr [[Clare Gerada]] commented:{{cquote|We already spend up to £1bn regulating doctors. We are one of the most over-regulated professions around and there will always be people who fall through. If we pile on more and more regulation we will never win.<ref>[http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/newsarticle-content/-/article_display_list/12822006/gerada-warning-on-over-regulation-after-documentary-secretly-films-gp-consultations Gerada warning on 'over-regulation' after documentary secretly films GP consultations - Pulse 04 Oct 2011]</ref>}}

Academics at [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ King's College London] researched the effects of increased regulatory transparency on the medical profession and found significant unintended consequences.  As doctors reacted anxiously to 'spectacles' of regulation and media headlines, they practised more defensively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|coauthors=Fischer, Michael D.|title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21155435}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|coauthors=Fischer, Michael Daniel|title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035}}</ref>

===Charity status===
The GMC was registered as a charity with the Charity Commission of England and Wales on 9 November 2001. The Commissioners having considered the court and the Commission's jurisdiction to consider an organisation's status, which had previously been considered by the courts, in issues of charitable status. 

Charities do not normally have to pay income tax or corporation tax, capital gains tax or stamp duty. Following the granting of charitable status the GMC obtained tax relief backdated to 1 April 1994.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/11_Implications_of_Charitable_Status_Paper.pdf_25398167.pdf Council 21-22 May 2002 To consider Implications of Charitable Status]</ref> Charities pay no more than 20% of normal business rates on the buildings they use and occupy. The GMC received confirmation of 80% business rates relief effective from April 1995.
 
According to accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 submitted by the GMC to the Charity Commission <ref>[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1089278&SubsidiaryNumber=0 Annual Accounts and Report submission to 31 December 2010 - 1089278 - General Medical Council]</ref> Income was £101.34m, Spending £87.34m  with a Retained Income of £14m for the year and Reserves of £40.672m.<ref>[http://www.gmc-uk.org/GMC_Trustees__Annual_Report_and_Accounts_for_the_Year_Ended_31_December_2010_45187200.doc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010]</ref>

===Shipman Inquiry===
The GMC was most heavily criticised by Dame [[Janet Smith (judge)|Janet Smith]] as part of her inquiry into the issues arising from the case of Dr [[Harold Shipman]]. "Expediency," says Dame Janet, "replaced principle." Dame Janet maintained that the GMC failed to deal properly with Fitness to Practise (FTP) cases, particularly involving established and respected doctors.<ref>Shipman inquiry. Safeguarding patients: lessons from the past—proposals for the future. 5th report, 2004. [http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/fifthreport.asp Online version].</ref>

In response to the Shipman report, Sir [[Liam Donaldson]], the then [[Chief Medical Officer, United Kingdom|Chief Medical Officer]], published a report titled ''Good doctors, safer patients'', which appeared in 2006.<ref>Donaldson, L. [http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4137232&chk=KW63va ''Good doctors, safer patients: Proposals to strengthen the system to assure and improve the performance of doctors and to protect the safety of patients; a report by the Chief Medical Officer'']. Department of Health, 2006-07-14. Accessed 2006-09-17.</ref> Donaldson echoed concerns about GMC FTP procedures and other functions of the Council. In his view, complaints were dealt with in a haphazard manner, the GMC caused distress to doctors over trivial complaints while tolerating poor practice in other cases. He accused the Council of being "secretive, tolerant of sub-standard practice and dominated by the professional interest, rather than that of the patient".  Former President of the General Medical Council, Sir Donald Irvine, called for the current Council to be disbanded and re-formed with new members.<ref>The Royal Society of Medicine. [http://www.rsm.ac.uk/media/pr209.htm ''Current GMC should be disbanded, says former President'']. Accessed 2006-09-16.</ref>

===Penny Mellor===
In July 2010 the GMC was severely criticized in an open letter in the [[British Medical Journal]] by Professionals Against Child Abuse for the decision to include Penny Mellor on the GMC's Expert Group on Child Protection. According to the letter, Penny Mellor had been convicted and imprisoned for conspiring to abduct a child, and had led protracted hostile campaigns including false allegations against doctors and other professionals involved in child protection cases. She had also campaigned against Sir [[Roy Meadow]] and Professor [[David Southall]], who were erased from the medical register by the GMC but subsequently re-instated after court rulings.[http://paca.org.uk/2010/08/25/open-letter-to-the-chair-of-the-gmc-professor-rubin/] Penny Mellor subsequently resigned from the Expert Group.

==Other bodies regulating healthcare professionals==

===UK===
The [[Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence]] (CHRE), is an independent body accountable to the UK Parliament, with the remit to promote the health and well-being of patients and the public in the regulation of health professionals. It advises the four UK government health departments on issues relating to the regulation of health professionals; scrutinising and overseeing the work of the nine regulatory bodies:-

* [[Health Professions Council]] (regulates other health professions in the UK)
* [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (regulates nurses and midwives)
* [[General Optical Council]]
* [[General Dental Council]]
* [[General Chiropractic Council]]
* [[General Osteopathic Council]]
* [[General Pharmaceutical Council]]
* [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]]
* General Medical Council

In response to the Government's recent proposals the [[Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence]] has made a call for ideas in their December 2011 paper 'Cost effectiveness and efficiency in health professional regulation' <ref>[http://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/pdf_1324311061.pdf - Cost effectiveness and efficiency in health professional regulation (December 2011)]</ref> for 'right-touch regulation' described as being {{cquote|based on a careful assessment of risk, which is targeted and proportionate, which provides a framework in which professionalism can flourish and organisational excellence can be achieved.}}

===Elsewhere===
Other countries, including [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[Singapore]], have a central regulator similar to the GMC. In the [[USA]], each state has its own regulatory board for doctors. In [[Germany]], each state has an ''Ärztekammer'' with lawful authority to regulate the medical profession, there is no federal level authority for the Federal Republic of Germany. Nevertheless, the ''[[German Medical Association|Bundesärztekammer]]'', a voluntary association of private law, was founded to support the professions' interests.  The [[Irish Medical Council]] acts as regulator in the [[Republic of Ireland]].
