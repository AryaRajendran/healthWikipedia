The '''London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine''' (informally the '''LSHTM''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[London]], United Kingdom specialised in [[public health]] and [[tropical medicine]] and a constituent college of the [[University of London]]. It was founded by [[Patrick Manson|Sir Patrick Manson]] in 1899.

The university is one of the most prestigious institutions in the world in the fields of public health and tropical medicine. 

The LSHTM's mission is to contribute to the improvement of health worldwide through the pursuit of excellence in research, postgraduate teaching and advanced training in national and international public health and tropical medicine, and through informing policy and practice in these areas. It had a total income of £101.7&nbsp;million in 2009/10, of which £62.5&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts.<ref name=fincdata>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415728&c=2|title=Wealth and Health: Financial data for UK higher education institutions, 2009–10|accessdate=15 December 2011|publisher=Times Higher Education| date=7 April 2011}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Seamens Hospital, Royal Albert Dock, London. (3525901692).jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital]] in the early 20th century.]]
The School was founded in 1899 by Sir [[Patrick Manson]] as the '''London School of Tropical Medicine''' and located at the [[Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital]] in the [[London Docklands]].<ref name="ActaTrop2001-Cook">{{cite journal | author=Cook GC, Webb AJ | title=The Albert Dock Hospital, London: the original site (in 1899) of Tropical Medicine as a new discipline | journal=Acta Trop | year=2001 | pages=249–55 | volume=79 | issue=3 | pmid=11412810 | doi=10.1016/S0001-706X(01)00127-9}}</ref>  Just prior to this teaching in tropical medicine had been commenced in 1899 at the Extramural School at Edinburgh and even earlier at London's Livingstone College founded in 1893 by Charles F. Harford-Battersby (1865–1925). Before giving lectures at St. George's Hospital, London, in 1895, Livingstone College afforded Manson his first opportunity to teach courses in tropical medicine.<ref>Johnson, Ryan (1910)Colonial Mission and Imperial Tropical Medicine: Livingstone College, London, 1893–1914, Social History of Medicine Volume23, Issue3 Pp. 549-566</ref> Manson's early career was as a physician in the Far East where he deduced the correct etiology of filariasis, a parasitic vector based disease, transmitted through the bite of a mosquito. On his return to London, he was appointed Medical Advisor to the Colonial Office. He strongly believed that doctors should be trained in tropical medicine to treat British colonial administrators and others working throughout Britain's tropical empire. He also encouraged and mentored [[Ronald Ross]] during this period to uncover the correct etiology of malaria, which Ross subsequently discovered in 1898, winning the [[Nobel Prize]] for his efforts. The original School was established as part of the [[Seamen's Hospital Society]].

In 1920 the School moved, with the [[Hospital for Tropical Diseases]], to Endsleigh Gardens in central London, taking over a former hotel which had been used as a hospital for officers during the First World War.<!--

In 1921 the Athlone Committee recommended the creation of an institute of state medicine, which built on a proposal by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to develop a London-based institution that would lead the world in the promotion of public health and tropical medicine. This enlarged School, now named the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine was granted its [[Royal Charter]] in 1924.

The School moved to its present location in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in 1929. 
 
The School is part of the University of London and is the University's major resource for postgraduate teaching and research in public health and tropical medicine. On successful completion of their studies, students gain a University of London degree.

==Building==

A competition to design a new School building to be sited in Gower Street, was held involving five architects, all experienced in laboratory design and construction. This was won in 1925 by Morley Horder and Verner Rees who located the main entrance in Keppel Street. This building was opened in 1929 by HRH the Prince of Wales. The purchase of the site and the cost of a new building was made possible through a gift of $2m from the Rockefeller Foundation.

===Faculties===

====Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health====

The Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health aims to be a methodological centre of excellence for research in national and global health issues, to expand the limits of epidemiological thinking & multi-disciplinary research to further understanding of health issues in their full complexity, to develop, refine and disseminate tools & methods for research design, data collection, analysis and evaluation, and to conduct rigorous research in national and global health. Research publications for Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health can be found in [http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/view/divisions/EPAA/ LSHTM Research Online] 

The Faculty has expertise in: 

*Clinical trials
*Analysis of routinely collected statistics
*Indirect techniques for measuring mortality in developing countries
*Conduct and analysis of observational studies
*Large-scale field trials
*Design and evaluation of interventions
*National and global health

====Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases====
The Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (ITD) was formed in August 1997 and encompasses all of the laboratory-based research in the School as well as that on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of infectious and tropical diseases. It is currently headed by Simon Croft, who is Professor of Parasitology. The Faculty is organised into four large research departments. The range of disciplines represented in the aculty is very broad and inter-disciplinary research is a feature of much of our activity. Research publications for the Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases can be found in [http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/view/divisions/ITAA/ LSHTM Reseach Online] The spectrum of diseases studied is wide and there are major research groups working on topics which include: 

*HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
*malaria and other vector borne diseases
*tuberculosis
*vaccine development and evaluation
