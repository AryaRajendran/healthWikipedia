{{italic title}}
'''''Trypanosoma brucei''''' is a protozoan with flagella  ([[protist]]) species that causes [[African trypanosomiasis]] (or sleeping sickness) in humans and [[nagana]] in animals in [[Africa]]. There are 3 sub-species of ''T. brucei'': ''T. b. brucei'', ''T. b. gambiense'' and ''T. b. rhodesiense''.

These [[obligate parasite]]s have two hosts - an [[insect]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and [[mammalian]] host. Due to the large difference between these hosts the trypanosome undergoes complex changes during its [[African trypanosomiasis#Life cycle|life cycle]] to facilitate its survival in the insect gut and the mammalian bloodstream. It also features a unique and notable variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat in order to avoid the host's immune system. There is an urgent need for the development of new drug therapies as current treatments can prove fatal to the patient as well as the trypanosomes.

==Infection: Trypanosomiasis==

{{main|African Trypanosomiasis}}

The insect vector for ''T. brucei'' is the [[tsetse fly]]. The parasite lives in the midgut of the fly (procyclic form), whereupon it migrates to the salivary glands for injection to the mammalian host on biting. The parasite lives within the bloodstream (bloodstream form) where it can reinfect the fly vector after biting. Later during a ''T. brucei'' infection the parasite may migrate to other areas of the host. A ''T. brucei'' infection may be transferred human to human via bodily fluid exchange, primarily blood transfer.

There are three different sub-species of ''T. brucei'', which cause different variants of trypanosomiasis.
*''T. brucei gambiense'' - Causes slow onset chronic trypanosomiasis in humans.  Most common in central and western Africa and Everglades, where humans are thought to be the primary [[natural reservoir|reservoir]].<ref name=Barrett>{{cite journal |author=Barrett MP, Burchmore RJ, Stich A, ''et al.'' |title=The trypanosomiases |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9394 |pages=1469–80 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14602444 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14694-6 }}</ref>
*''T. brucei rhodesiense'' - Causes fast onset acute trypanosomiasis in humans.  Most common in southern and eastern Africa, where game animals and livestock are thought to be the primary [[natural reservoir|reservoir]].<ref name=Barrett/>
*''T. brucei brucei'' - Causes [[nagana|animal African trypanosomiasis]], along with several other species of [[trypanosoma]].  ''T. b. brucei'' is not human infective due to its susceptibility to lysis by Trypanosome Lytic Factor-1 (TLF-1)]].<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23059119</ref>  However, as it shares many features with ''T. b. gambiense'' and ''T. b. rhodesiense'' (such as [[#The VSG coat|antigenic variation]]) it is used as a model for human infections in [[cell culture|laboratory]] and [[animal testing|animal studies]].

==Cell structure==
The structure of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is fairly typical of [[eukaryote]]s (see [[eukaryotic cell]]). All major organelles are seen, including the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondria]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]] etc. Unusual features include the single large mitochondria with the [[mitochondrial DNA]] structure known as the [[kinetoplast]], and its association with the [[basal body]] of the [[flagellum]]. The [[cytoskeleton]] is made up primarily of [[microtubules]]. The cell surface of the bloodstream form features a dense coat of variable surface glycoproteins (VSGs) which is replaced by an equally dense coat of procyclins when the parasite differentiates into the procylic in the tsetse fly midgut.

[[File:TrypanosomatidMorphologies PlainSVG.svg|thumb|right|The six main morphologies of trypanosomatids. The different life cycle stages of ''Trypanosoma brucei'' fall into the promastigote and epimastigote morphological categories.]]
[[Trypanosomatida|Trypanosomatids]] show specific cellular forms of which two are adopted by ''Trypanosoma brucei'' at different stages of the life cycle:
*Epimastigote - Basal body anterior of nucleus, with a long flagellum attached along the cell body.
*Trypomastigote - Basal body posterior of nucleus, with a long flagellum attached along the cell body.
These names are derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''mastig-'' meaning [[whip]], referring to the trypanosome's whip-like flagellum.

''T. brucei'' is found as a trypomastigote  in the slender, stumpy, procyclic and metacyclic forms.  The procylic form differentiates to the proliferitive epimastigote form in the salivary glands of the insect.  Unlike some other trypanosomatids, the promastigote and amastigote form do not form part of the ''T.brucei'' life cycle.

===Genome===
The [[genome]] of ''T. brucei'' is made up of:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ogbadoyi E, Ersfeld K, Robinson D, Sherwin T, Gull K |title=Architecture of the Trypanosoma brucei nucleus during interphase and mitosis |journal=Chromosoma |volume=108 |issue=8 |pages=501–13 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10794572 |doi= 10.1007/s004120050402|url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00412/bibs/0108008/01080501.htm}}</ref>
*11 pairs of large [[chromosome]]s of 1 to 6 megabase pairs.
*3-5 intermediate chromosomes of 200 to 500 kilobase pairs.
*Around 100 mini chromosomes of around 50 to 100 kilobase pairs. These may be present in multiple copies per [[haploid]] genome.
The large chromosomes contain most [[gene]]s, while the small chromosomes tend to carry genes involved in [[antigen]]ic variation, including the VSG genes. The genome has been sequenced and is available online [http://www.genedb.org].

The mitochondrial genome is found condensed into the [[kinetoplast]], an unusual feature unique to the  [[kinetoplastea]] class. It and the [[basal body]] of the [[flagellum]] are strongly associated via a cytoskeletal structure.

===VSG surface coat===
''Main section: [[#The VSG coat|The VSG coat]]''

The surface of the trypanosome is covered by a dense coat of Variable Surface Glycoprotein (VSG), which allows persistence of an infecting trypanosome population in the host. See below.

===Cytoskeleton===
The [[cytoskeleton]] is predominantly made up of [[microtubules]], forming a subpellicular corset. The microtubules lie parallel to each other along the long axis of the cell, with the number of microtubules at any point roughly proportional to the circumference of the cell at that point. As the cell grows (including for mitosis) additional microtubules grow between the existing tubules, leading to semiconservative inheritance of the cytoskeleton. The microtubules are orientated + at the posterior and - at the anterior.

[[Microfilament]] and [[intermediate filament]]s also play an important role in the cytoskeleton, but these are generally overlooked.

====Flagellar structure====
[[Image:Trypanosome Flagellum Structure.png|thumbnail|''Trypanosoma Brucei flagellar'' structure.]]
The trypanosome flagellum has two main structures. It is made up of a typical flagellar axoneme which lies parallel to the paraflagellar rod, a lattice structure of proteins unique to the [[kinetoplastida]], [[euglenoid]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s.

The microtubules of the flagellar [[axoneme]] lie in the normal 9+2 arrangement, orientated with the + at the anterior end and the - in the basal body. The a cytoskeletal structure extends from the basal body to the kinetoplast. The flagellum is bound to the cytoskeleton of the main cell body by four specialised microtubules, which run parallel and in the same direction to the flagellar tubulin.

The flagellar function is twofold - locomotion via oscilations along the attached flagellum and cell body, and attachment to the fly gut during the procyclic phase.

==VSG coat==
The surface of the trypanosome is covered by a dense coat of ~1x10<sup>7</sup> molecules of Variable Surface [[Glycoprotein]] (VSG).<ref name=Barry>{{cite journal |author=Barry JD, McCulloch R |title=Antigenic variation in trypanosomes: enhanced phenotypic variation in a eukaryotic parasite |journal=Adv Parasitol. |volume=49 |pages=1–70 |year=2001 |pmid=11461029 |doi=10.1016/S0065-308X(01)49037-3 |series=Advances in Parasitology |isbn=978-0-12-031749-3 }}</ref> This coat enables an infecting ''T. brucei'' population to persistently evade the host's [[immune system]], allowing chronic infection.  The two properties of the VSG coat that allow immune evasion are:
*Shielding - the dense nature of the VSG coat prevents the immune system of the mammalian host from accessing the [[cell membrane|plasma membrane]] or any other invariant surface [[epitopes]] (such as [[ion channels]], [[membrane transporter|transporters]], [[cell receptor|receptors]] etc.) of the parasite.  The coat is uniform, made up of millions of copies of the same molecule; therefore the only parts of the trypanosome the immune system can 'see' are the [[n-terminus|N-terminal]] [[secondary structure|loops]] of the VSG that make up the coat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Overath P, Chaudhri M, Steverding D, Ziegelbauer K |title=Invariant surface proteins in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Parasitol. Today (Regul. Ed.) |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=53–8 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=15275499 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0169-4758(94)90393-X |doi=10.1016/0169-4758(94)90393-X}}</ref>
*Periodic [[antigenic variation]] - the VSG coat undergoes frequent [[stochastic]] genetic modification - 'switching' - allowing variants expressing a new VSG coat to escape the [[adaptive immunity|specific immune response]] raised against the previous coat.

===Antigenic variation===
[[Sequencing]] of the ''T. brucei'' [[genome]] has revealed a huge ''VSG'' gene archive, made up of thousands of different ''VSG'' [[genes]].  All but one of these are 'silent' VSGs, as each trypanosome [[gene expression|expresses]] only one ''VSG'' gene at a time.  VSG is highly [[immunogenic]], and an [[adaptive immunity|immune response]] raised against a specific VSG will rapidly kill trypanosomes expressing this ''VSG''.  This can also be observed [[in vitro]] by a [[complement system|complement-mediated]] [[lysis]] [[assay]].  However, with each [[cell division]] there is a possibility that one or both of the [[offspring|progeny]] will switch expression to a silent ''VSG'' from the archive (see below).  The frequency of such a switch has been measured to be approximately 1:100.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turner CM |title=The rate of antigenic variation in fly-transmitted and syringe-passaged infections of Trypanosoma brucei |journal=FEMS Microbiol Lett. |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=227–31 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9252591 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-1097(97)00266-8 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1997.tb10486.x}}</ref>  This new VSG will likely not be recognised by the specific immune responses raised against previously expressed VSGs.  It takes several days for an immune response against a specific  to develop, giving trypanosomes which have undergone VSG coat switching some time to reproduce (and undergo further VSG coat switching events) unhindered.  Repetition of this process prevents extinction of the infecting trypanosome population, allowing chronic persistence of parasites in the host.  The clinical effect of this cycle is successive 'waves' of parasitaemia (trypanosomes in the blood).<ref name=Barry/>

===VSG structure===
''VSG'' genes are hugely variable at the [[DNA sequencing|sequence]] level.  However, for them to fulfill their shielding function, different VSGs have strongly conserved [[protein structure|structural]] features.  VSGs are made up of a highly variable [[n-terminus|N terminal]] [[protein domain|domain]] of around 300 to 350 [[list of standard amino acids|amino acids]], and a more conserved [[c-terminus|C terminal]] domain of around 100 amino acids. The C terminal domain forms a structural bundle of four [[alpha helix|alpha helices]], while the N terminal domain forms a 'halo' around the helices. The [[tertiary structure]] of this halo is well conserved between different VSGs (in spite of wide variation in amino acid sequence) allowing different VSGs to form the physical barrier required to shield the trypanosome's surface. VSG is anchored to the cell membrane via a [[glycophosphatidylinositol|glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor]] - a [[covalent]] linkage from the C terminus, to approximately four sugars, to a [[phosphatidylinositol]] phospholipid acid which lies in the cell membrane.  VSGs form [[homodimers]].

===VSG archive structure===
The ''VSG'' gene archive is the collection of silent VSGs in the ''T. brucei'' [[genome]].  Some of these are full-length, intact [[genes]]; others are [[pseudogenes]]) typically with omitted sections or premature [[stop codon]]s.  Expression of an [[antigen]]ically novel VSG can occur by simply switching to a different full-length VSG gene.  However, only 5% of the archive is made up of such complete silent VSGs.  To utilise the rest of the silent VSG archive, ‘mosaic’ VSGs can be formed by replacing part of the expressed VSG with a [[protein structure|structurally homologous]] region from the archive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marcello L, Barry JD |title=Analysis of the VSG gene silent archive in Trypanosoma brucei reveals that mosaic gene expression is prominent in antigenic variation and is favored by archive substructure |journal=Genome Res. |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=1344–52 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17652423 |pmc=1950903 |doi=10.1101/gr.6421207 }}</ref>  The combinatorial nature of mosaic formation in conjunction with the huge silent VSG archive gives the parasite a theoretically limitless VSG library, and is the major barrier to [[vaccine]] development.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbour AG, Restrepo BI |title=Antigenic variation in vector-borne pathogens |journal=Emerging Infect Dis. |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=449–57 |year=2000 |pmid=10998374 |doi=10.3201/eid0605.000502 |pmc=2627965 }}</ref>

===VSG expression===
One major focus in trypanosome research is how the majority of VSG genes are kept silent, and how these genes are switched. The expressed VSG is always located in an Expression Site - found at the [[telomeres]] of the large and intermediate chromosomes. Each is a polycistronic unit, containing a number of Expression Site-Associated Genes (ESAGs) all expressed along with the active VSG. While there are at least 20 known expression sites, only a single one is ever active at one time. A number of mechanisms appear to be involved in this process, but the exact nature of the silencing is still unclear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pays E |title=Regulation of antigen gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=517–20 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16126458 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2005.08.016 }}</ref>

The VSG can be switched either by changing the active expression (from the active to a previously silent site) or by changing the VSG gene in the active site. The genome contains many copies of possible VSG genes, both on minichromosomes and in repeated sections in the interior of the chromosomes. These are generally silent, typically with omitted sections or premature stop codons, but are important in the evolution of new VSG genes. It is estimated up to 10% of the ''T.brucei'' genome may be made up of VSG genes or [[pseudogenes]]. Any of these genes can be moved into the active site by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] for expression. Again, the exact mechanisms that control this are still only partially known.

==Cell division==
[[Image:Trypanosome Cell Cycle.png|thumbnail|Trypanosome cell cycle (procyclic form).]]
The mitotic division of ''T.brucei'' is unusual compared to most eukaryotes. The nuclear membrane remains intact and the chromosomes do not condense during mitosis. The basal body, unlike the [[centrosome]] of most eukaryotic cells, does not play a role in the organisation of the spindle and instead is involved in division of the kinetoplast.

Stages of mitosis:
#The basal body duplicates and both remain associated with the kinetoplast.
#Kinetoplast DNA undergoes synthesis then the kinetoplast divides coupled with separation of the two basal bodies.
#Nuclear DNA undergoes synthesis while a new flagellum extends from the younger, more posterior, basal body.
#The nucleus undergoes mitosis.
#[[Cytokinesis]] progresses from the anterior to posterior.
#Division completes with abscission.
