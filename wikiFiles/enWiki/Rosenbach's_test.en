'''Rosenbach's test''' is a [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] [[medical test]] to detect the presence of [[bile]] in [[urine]]. To carry out the test, the urine is passed through the same filter paper several times. The filter paper is then dried, and a drop of [[nitric acid]] is added. In the presence of bile, the characteristic bile pigment colours appear (a yellow spot with rings of red, violet, blue and green around it).<ref>[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Rosenbach%27s+test Rosenbach's test] at Mondofacto medical dictionary online</ref>

The test is named after [[Ottomar Rosenbach]].
