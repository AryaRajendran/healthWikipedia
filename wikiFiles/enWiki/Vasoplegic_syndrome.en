'''Vasoplegic syndrome (VPS)''' is a postperfusion syndrome characterized low systemic vascular resistance and a high cardiac output.

==Definition==
Vasoplegic syndrome is defined as low systemic vascular resistance ( SVR index <1,600 dyn∙seg/cm5/m2 ) and high cardiac output ( cardiac index >2.5 l/min/m2 ) within the first 4 postoperative hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccforum.com/content/11/S2/P254 |title=Critical Care &#124; Full text &#124; Vasoplegic syndrome after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery – associated factors and clinical outcomes: a nested case-control study |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Causes==
VPS occurs more frequently after on pump [[CABG]] surgery verses off pump CABG surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sun X, Zhang L, Hill PC, ''et al.'' |title=Is incidence of postoperative vasoplegic syndrome different between off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery? |journal=Eur J Cardiothorac Surg |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=820–5 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18715792 |doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.07.012 |url=}}</ref>  Hypothermia during surgery may also increase ones risk of developing VPS post operatively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xu J, Long C, Qi R, Xie L, Shi S, Zhang Y |title=[Study of mechanism of vasoplegic syndrome for open heart surgery] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=127–30 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11953144 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is some evidence to support the use of methylene blue in the treatment of this condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=911 |title=BestBets: Is Methylene Blue of benefit in treating adult patients who develop vasoplegic syndrome during Cardiac Surgery |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stawicki SP, Sims C, Sarani B, Grossman MD, Gracias VH |title=Methylene blue and vasoplegia: who, when, and how? |journal=Mini Rev Med Chem |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=472–90 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18473936 |doi= 10.2174/138955708784223477|url=http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?MRMC/2008/00000008/00000005/0006N.SGM}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
One case series reports a rate of 1 in 120 cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gomes WJ, Carvalho AC, Palma JH, Gonçalves Júnior I, Buffolo E |title=[Vasoplegic syndrome: a new dilemma] |journal=Rev Assoc Med Bras |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=304 |year=1994 |pmid=7633508 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
