'''Phyllodes tumors''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''phullon'' leaf), also '''cystosarcoma phyllodes''', '''cystosarcoma phylloides''' and '''phylloides tumor''', are typically large, fast growing masses that form from the periductal [[stromal cell]]s of the [[breast]]. They account for less than 1% of all breast [[Neoplasia|neoplasms]].

==Classification==
Phyllodes tumors are a [[fibroepithelial tumor]] composed of an epithelial and a cellular stromal component. They may be considered [[benign]], borderline, or [[malignant]] depending on histologic features including stromal cellularity, infiltration at the tumor's edge, and [[mitoses|mitotic activity]].  All forms of phyllodes tumors are regarded as having malignant potential. They are also known as '''''serocystic disease of Brodie'''''.

They are classified as a [[fibroepithelial tumor]] by [[ICD-O]], but not by [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]].

Approximately 60-70% of examined tumors are benign; the proportion of benign cases is higher in young women.<ref name="Guillot_2011">{{cite pmid|21251125}}</ref>

This was predominantly the tumor of adult women, with very few examples reported in adolescents. 
Patients typically present with a firm, palpable mass.  These tumors are very fast growing, and can increase in size in just a few weeks.  Occurrence is most common between the ages of 40 and 50, prior to [[menopause]]. This is about 15 years older than the typical age of patients with [[fibroadenoma]], a condition with which phyllodes tumors may be confused. They have been documented to occur at any age above 12 years.

==Treatment==
The common treatment for phyllodes is [[wide local excision]].  Other than surgery, there is no cure for phyllodes, as chemotherapy and radiation therapy are not effective.  The risk of developing local recurrence or [[metastasis|metastases]] is related to the  histologic grade, according to the above-named features. Despite wide excision a very high percentage of surgeries yielded incomplete excision margins that required revision surgery.<ref name="Guillot_2011"/>

A large recent study has derived a risk calculator for relapse risk of phyllodes tumors after surgery.<ref name="PMID22049216"> This is available at www.phyllodes.com.

 |pmid=22049216 |doi=10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200368}}</ref>

A recent study (Aug 2009) by Barth ''et al.'' suggests that radiation treatment after [[breast-conserving surgery]] with negative margins significantly reduces the 
local recurrence rate for borderline and malignant tumors.<ref name="PMID19424757">{{cite journal |author=Barth RJ Jr, Wells WA, Mitchell SE, Cole BF |title=A prospective, multi-institutional study of adjuvant radiotherapy after resection of malignant phyllodes tumors. |journal=Ann Surg Oncol. |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=2288–94 |year=2009
 |pmid=19424757 |doi=10.1245/s10434-009-0489-2}}</ref>

==Spectrum==
Phyllodes tumors are considered to be on a [[spectrum]] of disease<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deen SA, McKee GT, Kissin MW |title=Differential cytologic features of fibroepithelial lesions of the breast |journal=Diagn. Cytopathol. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=53–6 |year=1999 |pmid=9951596 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0339(199902)20:2<53::AID-DC1>3.0.CO;2-T}}</ref> that consists of [[fibroadenoma]], fibroadenoma variant and benign phyllodes.  Some would extend the spectrum to include malignant phyllodes tumors and frank [[sarcoma]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
