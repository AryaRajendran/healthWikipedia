'''Hemolytic disease of the newborn''', also known as '''hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn''', '''HDN''', '''HDFN''', or '''erythroblastosis fetalis''',<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952444|erythroblastosis fetalis}}</ref> is an [[alloimmune]] condition that develops in a [[fetus]], when the [[IgG]] molecules (one of the five main types of [[antibody|antibodies]]) produced by the mother pass through the [[placenta]]. Among these antibodies are some which attack the [[red blood cell]]s in the fetal circulation;  the red cells are broken down and the fetus can develop [[reticulocytosis]] and [[anemia]].  This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure ([[hydrops fetalis]]) can occur.  When the disease is moderate or severe, many [[erythroblast]]s are present in the fetal blood and so these forms of the disease can be called ''erythroblastosis fetalis'' (or ''erythroblastosis foetalis'').

==Symptoms==
[[Hemolysis]] leads to elevated [[bilirubin]] levels.  After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the [[symptom]]s of [[jaundice]] (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes) increase within 24 hours after birth.  Like any other severe [[neonatal jaundice]], there is the possibility of acute or chronic [[kernicterus]]. Profound anemia can cause high-output [[heart failure]], with [[pallor]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] and/or [[splenomegaly|spleen]], generalized [[edema|swelling]], and [[shortness of breath|respiratory distress]].  The prenatal manifestations are known as [[hydrops fetalis]]; in severe forms this can include [[petechia]]e and [[purpura]].  The infant may be [[stillbirth|stillborn]] or die shortly after birth.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Causes==
Antibodies are produced when the body is exposed to an [[antigen]] foreign to the make-up of the body.  If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it ''in utero'' and persist after delivery.   The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i.e., produces IgG [[antibodies]] against) a particular antigen are:

*[[Fetal-maternal hemorrhage]] can occur due to trauma, abortion, childbirth, ruptures in the [[placenta]] during [[pregnancy]], or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these antibodies are then able to cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream to attach to the [[red blood cell]]s and cause [[hemolysis]]. In other words, if a mother has anti-RhD (D being the major Rhesus antigen) IgG antibodies as a result of previously carrying a RhD-positive fetus, this antibody will only affect a fetus with RhD-positive blood.

*The woman may have received a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]].  [[ABO|ABO blood group system]] and the D antigen of the [[Rhesus blood group system]] typing are routine prior to transfusion.  Suggestions have been made that women of child bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or [[Kell antigen system|Kell<sub>1</sub>]]-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization, but this would strain the resources of blood transfusion services, and it is currently considered uneconomical to screen for these blood groups.  HDFN can also be caused by antibodies to a variety of other [[blood group system]] antigens, but Kell and Rh are the most frequently encountered.

*The third sensitization model can occur in women of blood type O. The [[immune response]] to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads to the production of IgM anti-A and IgM anti-B antibodies early in life.  On rare occasions, IgG antibodies are produced.  In contrast, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens.

== Serological diagnoses ==
*ABO system
**[[ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn]] can range from mild to severe, but generally it is a mild disease.
*** anti-A antibodies
*** anti-B antibodies
*Rhesus system
**[[Rhesus disease|rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (often called Rh disease) is the most common form of severe HDN.  The disease varies from mild to severe.
**[[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-RhE)|rhesus E hemolytic disease of the newborn]] is a mild condition
**[[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Rhc)|rhesus c hemolytic disease of the newborn]] can range from a mild to severe disease - is the third most common form of severe HDN
**rhesus e hemolytic disease of the newborn - rare
**rhesus C hemolytic disease of the newborn - rare
**antibody combinations (i.e. anti-Rhc and anti-RhE antibodies occurring together) - can be severe
*Kell system
**[[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)|anti-Kell hemolytic disease of the newborn]]
***anti-K<sub> 1</sub> antibodies - disease ranges from mild to severe - over half of the cases are caused by multiple blood transfusions - is the second most common form of severe HDN
***anti-K<sub> 2</sub>, anti-K<sub> 3</sub> and anti-K<sub> 4</sub> antibodies - rare
*Other blood group antibodies (Kidd, Lewis, Duffy, MN, P and others).

==Diagnosis==
The [[diagnosis]] of HDN is based on history and laboratory findings:

''Blood tests done on the newborn baby''
* Biochemistry tests for [[jaundice]]
* Peripheral blood [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] shows increased [[reticulocyte]]s.  [[Erythroblast]]s (also known as nucleated red blood cells) occur in moderate and severe disease.
* Positive [[Coombs test#Direct Coombs test|direct Coombs test]] (might be negative after fetal interuterine blood transfusion)
''Blood tests done on the mother''  
* Positive [[Coombs test#Indirect Coombs test|indirect Coombs test]]

==Treatment==
Before birth, options for treatment include intrauterine [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] or early induction of labor when pulmonary maturity has been attained, fetal distress is present, or 35 to 37 weeks of [[gestation]] have passed. The mother may also undergo [[exchange transfusion|plasma exchange]] to reduce the circulating levels of antibody by as much as 75%.
  
After birth, treatment depends on the severity of the condition, but could include temperature stabilization and monitoring, [[phototherapy]], transfusion with compatible packed red blood, [[exchange transfusion]] with a [[blood type]] compatible with both the infant and the mother, [[sodium bicarbonate]] for correction of [[acidosis]] and/or assisted ventilation.   
  
Rhesus-negative mothers who have had a pregnancy who are pregnant with a rhesus-positive infant are offered Rh immune [[globulin]] (RhIG) at 28 weeks during pregnancy, at 34 weeks, and within 72 hours after delivery to prevent sensitization to the D antigen. It works by binding any fetal red cells with the D antigen before the mother is able to produce an immune response and form anti-D IgG. A drawback to pre-partum administration of RhIG is that it causes a positive antibody screen when the mother is tested, which can be difficult to distinguish from natural immunological responses that result in antibody production.

==Complications and similar conditions ==
Complications of HDN could include [[kernicterus]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]], inspissated (thickened or dried) bile syndrome and/or greenish staining of the [[teeth]], [[hemolytic anemia]] and damage to the liver due to excess bilirubin. Similar conditions include [[Hemolytic anemia#Acquired|acquired hemolytic anemia]], congenital [[toxoplasma]] and [[syphilis]] infection, congenital obstruction of the [[bile duct]] and [[cytomegalovirus]] infection.

==In animals==
[[File:Djaenisse moultea.JPG|thumb|Mule foal, 7-days-old, in the last stage of hemolytic disease; symptoms appeared only on Day 6]]
Hemolytic disease is a well-known condition in newborn foals, especially in [[Thoroughbred]]s and [[mule]]s. Mares or jennies which have been sensitized by a previous pregnancy develop antibodies by fetal blood cells crossing the placental barrier. The iso-antibodies do not transcend the fetal barrier, but are present in [[colostrum]]. The [[Neonatal Fc receptor]] which in case of humans transfer the maternal antibody from mother through placenta to fetus, in this case is involved in transporting the IgG1 antibodies from mother animal's mammary gland into milk and then again from the ingested milk across the newborn intestine into the newborn animal's circulation.<ref>Immunology. 2002 November; 107(3): 288–296.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1782797/</ref> The [[Placentation#Placentation_in_mammals|placenta]] of mammals can be of many varieties and unless it is [[hemochorial placenta|hemochorial]] like humans and some rodents, the IgG of mother cannot directly cross the placenta and passively immunize the fetus. Horse (and also ruminants) have [[epitheliochorial placenta]]. Thus IgG1 will enter the bloodstream of the foal only after birth when colostrum immunoglobulins are exposed to FcRn in the newborn intestine, in the first days of life. Hence, hemolytic disease will develop only after birth : first to 4th day in foal&nbsp;<ref>The Merck Veterinary Manual, 3rd ed. Merck and co. Inc. Rahway, N.J., USA, 1967.</ref> and 3 to 7 days in newborn mules. Affected animals show lethargy, recumbency, tachycardia, and progressive icterus of eye and mouth mucosae, which rapidly leads to death. The condition is also described in newborn pigs and other animals&nbsp;<ref>[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/10203.htm Hemolytic disease in animals]</ref>
