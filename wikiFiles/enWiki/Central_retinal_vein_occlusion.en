The [[central retinal vein]] is the venous equivalent of the [[central retinal artery]] and, like that blood vessel, it can suffer from [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] ('''central retinal vein occlusion''', also '''CRV'''<ref>Ophthalmology at a Glance, Jane Olver & Lorraine Cassidy, Blackwell Science 2005.</ref>), similar to that seen in [[ocular ischemic syndrome]]. Since the central retinal artery and vein are the sole source of blood supply and drainage for the retina, such occlusion can lead to severe damage to the retina and blindness, due to [[ischemia]] (restriction in blood supply) and [[macular edema|edema]] (swelling).<ref>Hayreh SS, Zimmerman MB, Podhajsky P. "Incidence of various types of vein occlusion and their recurrent demographic characteristics." Am J Ophthalmol. 1994; 117:429-441.</ref>

It can also cause [[glaucoma]].

Nonischemic CRVO is the milder form of the disease. It may progress to the more severe ischemic type.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1223746-overview</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of Anti-VEGF drugs like [[Lucentis]] or intravitreal steroid implant (Ozurdex) and Pan-Retinal Laser Photocoagulation usually. Underlying conditions also require treatment. Non-Ischemic CRVO has better visual prognosis than Ischemic CRVO.
