A '''hemangioma''' is a benign, and usually a self-[[involution (medicine)|involuting]] [[tumor]], (swelling or growth) of the [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells that line [[blood vessel]]s and is characterised by increased number of normal or abnormal vessels filled with blood. It usually appears during the first weeks of life and generally resolves by age 10. In more severe cases hemangiomas may leave residual tissue damage.  In infancy, it is the most common tumor.<ref name="pmid16950977">{{cite journal |author=Haggstrom AN, Drolet BA, Baselga E, ''et al.'' |title=Prospective study of infantile hemangiomas: clinical characteristics predicting complications and treatment |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=882–7 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16950977 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0413 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16950977}}</ref> The word "hemangioma" comes from the Greek ''haema-'' (αίμα), "blood"; ''angeio'' (αγγείο), "vessel"; ''-oma'' (-ωμα), "tumor".

==Terminology==
The terminology used to define, describe and categorize [[vascular anomalies]], abnormal lumps made up of blood vessels, has changed. The term ''hemangioma'' was originally used to describe any vascular [[tumor]]-like structure, whether it was present at or around birth or appeared later in life. Mulliken et al. categorized these conditions into two families: a family of self-[[involution (medicine)|involuting]] tumors, growing [[lesion]]s that eventually disappear, and another family of malformations, enlarged or abnormal vessels present at birth and essentially permanent. The importance of this distinction is that it makes it possible for early-in-life differentiation between lesions that will resolve versus those that are permanent. Examples of permanent malformations include [[port-wine stain]]s ([[capillary]] vascular malformation) and masses of abnormal swollen [[vein]]s (venous malformations).<ref name="pmid7063565">{{cite journal |author=Mulliken JB, Glowacki J |title=Hemangiomas and vascular malformations in infants and children: a classification based on endothelial characteristics |journal=Plast.

Unfortunately{{to whom|date=March 2013}} it is taking some time for other branches of medicine to adopt the new terminology which causes confusion.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}<!-- who says this is unfortunate; it is fairly common in esoteric technical language for verious disciplines and specialties to begin to use English words in somewhat defferent senses. -->

==Signs and symptoms==
Hemangiomas are connected to the [[circulatory system]].  The appearance depends on location. If they are on the surface of the skin, they are reminiscent of a ripe strawberry (hence, they are sometimes referred to as "strawberry hemangiomas"); however, if they are just under the skin they present as a bluish swelling. Sometimes they grow in internal organs such as the [[liver]], [[larynx]], or small and large intestine.<ref>http://www.lacolon.com/patient-education/gi-associated-hemangiomas-and-vascular-malformations</ref> In most cases, hemangiomas will disappear over time. Some are formed during [[gestation]]; the most common are not [[congenital]], but appear during the first few weeks of life. They are often initially misdiagnosed as a scratch or [[bruise]]; but the correct [[diagnosis]] becomes obvious with further growth. Typically, at the earliest phase in a superficial lesion, one will see a bluish red area with obvious blood vessels and surrounding [[pallor]]. Sometimes they present as a flat red or pink area. Hemangiomas are the most common childhood tumor, occurring in approximately ten percent of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s, and are less prevalent in other ethnicities. Females are three to five times as likely to have hemangiomas as males. Hemangiomas are also more common in [[twin]] [[pregnancies]]. Approximately 80% are located on the face and neck, or on the legs and arms; with the next most prevalent location being the liver. In infants, It may present itself soon after birth and is different than other [[vascular]] abnormalities present. They grow to around 80% of their maximum size in the first 3 months and most reach maximum size at around 5 months.<ref name="dermnet">{{cite web|last=Oakley|first=Amanda|title=Infantile haemangioma.|url=http://dermnetnz.org/vascular/haemangioma.html|publisher=[http://dermnetnz.org/ DermNet NZ]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref>

==Causes==
The cause of hemangioma is currently unknown; however, several studies have suggested the importance of [[estrogen]] signaling in hemangioma proliferation. In 2007, a paper from the Stanford Children's Surgical Laboratory revealed that localized soft tissue [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] coupled with increased circulating estrogen after birth may be the stimulus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinman ME, Greives MR, Churgin SS, ''et al.'' |title=Hypoxia-induced mediators of stem/progenitor cell trafficking are increased in children with hemangioma |journal=Arterioscler.

===Review of Histology===
[[File:Capillary hemangioma - very high mag.jpg|thumb|250px|Capillary hemangioma.]]
Under the microscope, hemangiomas are unencapsulated aggregates of closely packed, thin-walled capillaries, usually with endothelial lining. Blood-filled vessels are separated by scant connective tissue. Their lumens may be thrombosed and organized. Hemosiderin pigment due to vessel rupture sometimes can be noticed.<ref>Kumar Vinay: ''Robbins and Coltran pathologic basis of disease 8ed.''. pp. 520-521 Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier, 2010. ISBN 978-0-8089-2402-9</ref> Glut1 is a histochemical marker, highly specific for Haemangioma and can be used to differentiate Haemangioma from vascular malformations.<ref name="pmid10665907">{{cite journal |author=North PE, Waner M, Mizeracki A, Mihm MC Jr.|title=GLUT1: a newly discovered immunohistochemical marker for juvenile hemangiomas.|journal=Hum Pathology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–22|year=2000|month=Jan |pmid=10665907}}</ref>

==Complications==
The vast majority of hemangiomas are not associated with complications. Hemangiomas may break down on the surface, called [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]]. If the ulceration is deep, significant [[bleeding]] may occur in rare occasions. Ulceration on the deeper area can be painful and problematic. If a hemangioma develops in the [[larynx]], [[breathing]] can be compromised. A hemangioma can grow and block one of the [[human eye|eye]]s, causing an occlusion [[amblyopia]]. Very rarely, extremely large hemangiomas can cause high-output [[heart failure]] due to the amount of blood that must be pumped to excess blood vessels. Lesions adjacent to [[bone]] can also cause erosion of the bone.

The most frequent complaints about hemangiomas, however, stem from psychosocial complications: the condition can affect a person's appearance and can provoke attention and malicious reactions from others. Particular problems occur if the lip or nose is involved, as distortion can be difficult to treat [[surgically]]. The potential for psychological injury develops from school age onward. It is therefore important to consider treatment prior to school if adequate spontaneous improvement has not occurred.

Children with large segmental hemangiomas of the head and neck can be associated with a disorder called [[PHACES Syndrome]].<ref name="pmid18223093">{{cite journal |author=Oza VS, Wang E, Berenstein A, ''et al.'' |title=PHACES association: a neuroradiologic review of 17 patients |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=807–13 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18223093 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.A0937 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18223093}}</ref><ref name="pmid18174492">{{cite journal |author=Heyer GL, Dowling MM, Licht DJ, ''et al.'' |title=The cerebral vasculopathy of PHACES syndrome |journal=Stroke |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=308–16 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18174492 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.485185 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18174492}}</ref>

Most hemangiomas disappear without treatment, leaving minimal or no visible marks. Large hemangiomas can leave visible skin changes secondary to severe stretching of the skin or damage to surface texture. When hemangiomas interfere with vision, breathing, or threaten significant cosmetic injury (facial lesions and  in particular, nose and lips), they are usually treated.<ref>Hunzeker C, Geronemus R. "Treatment of Superficial Infantile Hemangiomas of the Eyelid Using the 595-nm Pulsed Dye Laser" Dermatol. Surg. 36(5):590-597 2010 [http://www.laserskinsurgery.com/f/Tx_of_Superficial_Infantile_Hemangiomas_of_the_Eye.pdf]</ref> 

Until recently, the mainstay of treatment was oral [[corticosteroid]] therapy, but there are now alternative treatments. A randomized trial showed that the [[beta-blocker]] [[propranolol]] reduced severe hemangiomas in infants.<ref name="pmid18550886">{{cite journal |author=Hogeling M et al. |title=A randomized controlled trial of propranolol for infantile hemangiomas |journal=Pediatrics |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=e259-e266 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid= |url=http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/128/2/e259.short |doi= 10.1542/peds.2010-0029}}</ref> The [[topically]] applied [[beta blocker]] solution/gel [[Timolol]] is also being trialled for small facial hemangiomas that do not justify systemic treatment.<ref name="timololgel">{{cite journal |author=Guo S, Ni N |title=Topical treatment for capillary hemangioma of the eyelid using beta-blocker solution |journal=Arch. Ophthalmol. |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=255–6 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20142555 |doi=10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.370 |url=}}; {{cite journal |author=Pope E, Chakkittakandiyil A |title=Topical timolol gel for infantile hemangiomas: a pilot study |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=564–5 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20479314 |doi=10.1001/archdermatol.2010.67 |url=}}</ref> Other treatments that have been used include [[interferon]]<ref name="pmid17337066">{{cite journal |author=Wilson MW, Hoehn ME, Haik BG, Rieman M, Reiss U |title=Low-dose cyclophosphamide and interferon alfa 2a for the treatment of capillary hemangioma of the orbit |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=114 |issue=5 |pages=1007–11 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17337066 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2006.11.031 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0161-6420(06)01612-5}}</ref> or [[vincristine]]. They may be considered if first-line therapy fails. 

Surgical removal is sometimes indicated, particularly if there has been delay in commencing treatment and structural changes have become irreversible. Surgery may also be necessary to correct distortion of facial features, again in the case of inadequate or failed early medical intervention. Blockage of the airway will often require a [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] to be performed, which involves the insertion of an external airway through the front of the neck into the trachea below the level of the obstruction. 

Smaller raised lesions are sometimes treated with injection of corticosteroid directly into the lesion. A pulsed [[dye laser]] can be useful for very early, flat, superficial lesions, if they appear in cosmetically significant areas or for those lesions that leave residual surface blood vessels in the case of incomplete resolution.<ref>Rizzo C, Brightman L, Chapas A, Hale E, Cantatore-Francis J, Bernstein L, Geronemus R. "Outcomes of Childhood Hemangiomas Treated with the Pulsed Dye Laser with Dynamic Cooling: A Retrospective Chart Analysis" Dermatol. Surg. 35(12):1947-1954. 2009 [http://www.laserskinsurgery.com/f/Outcomes_of_Childhood_Hemangiomas_Treated_with_the.pdf]</ref> Sometimes a pulsed dye laser can be used to accelerate healing. Unfortunately, raised lesions or lesions under the skin do not respond to laser treatment. Ulceration will usually heal with topical medication and special dressings under medical supervision.
Applying pressure is not beneficial, thus not recommended.

==Prognosis==
Hemangiomas go through three stages of development and decay: 

#In the proliferation stage, a hemangioma grows very quickly. This stage can last up to twelve months.
#In the rest stage, there is very little change in a hemangioma's appearance. This usually lasts until the infant is one to two years old.
#In the involution phase, a hemangioma finally begins to diminish in size. 50% of lesions will have disappeared by 5 years of age, and the vast majority will have gone by 10
