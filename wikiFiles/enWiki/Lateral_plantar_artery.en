The '''lateral plantar artery''' ('''external plantar artery'''), much larger than the medial, passes obliquely lateralward and forward to the base of the fifth [[metatarsal]] bone. 

It then turns medialward to the interval between the bases of the first and second metatarsal bones, where it unites with the deep plantar branch of the [[dorsalis pedis artery]], thus completing the [[plantar arch]]. 

As this artery passes lateralward, it is first placed between the [[calcaneus]] and [[Abductor hallucis]], and then between the [[Flexor digitorum brevis]] and [[Quadratus plant√¶]] as it runs forward to the base of the [[little toe]] it lies more superficially between the [[Flexor digitorum brevis]] and [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|Abductor digiti quinti]], covered by the [[plantar aponeurosis]] and integument. 

The remaining portion of the vessel is deeply situated; it extends from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone to the proximal part of the first interosseous space, and forms the plantar arch; it is convex forward, lies below the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones and the corresponding [[Interossei]], and upon the oblique part of the [[Adductor hallucis]].
