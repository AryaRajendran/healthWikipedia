The '''mylohyoid muscle''' is a [[muscle]] running from the [[Human mandible|mandible]] to the [[hyoid bone]], forming the floor of the [[oral cavity]].  It is named for its two attachments, with the prefix "mylo" coming from the Greek word for "molar".<ref>http://www.anatomy.usyd.edu.au/glossary/glossary.cgi?page=m</ref>  These muscles are mesodermal in origin.  The mylohyoid muscle is derived from the first pharyngeal arch.

==Structure==
The mylohyoid muscle is flat and triangular, and is situated immediately above the anterior belly of the [[digastric muscle]].  It forms, with its fellow of the opposite side, a muscular floor for the cavity of the [[mouth]]. Each [[submandibular gland]] is divided into superficial and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle.

It arises from the whole length of the mylohyoid line of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], extending from the symphysis in front to the last [[molar (tooth)|molar]] tooth behind. The posterior fibers pass inferomedially to insert into the body of the [[hyoid bone]]. It thus belongs to the [[suprahyoid muscles]].

The middle and anterior fibers are inserted into a median fibrous raphé extending from the [[symphysis menti]] to the [[hyoid bone]], where they joint at an angle with the fibers of the opposite muscle. This median raphé is sometimes absent; the fibers of the two muscles are then continuous.

==Innervation==
Along with the anterior belly of the [[digastric muscle]], the mylohyoid muscle is innervated by the [[mylohyoid nerve]], a branch of the [[inferior alveolar nerve]], which is a branch of the [[mandibular nerve]] V3, a division of the [[trigeminal nerve]] also known as cranial nerve V.

==Actions==
The mylohyoid depresses the [[Human mandible|mandible]] and elevates the [[hyoid]], the floor of the [[oral cavity]], and the tongue. This is particularly important during swallowing and speaking.

==Variations==
It may be united to or replaced by the anterior belly of the [[digastric muscle]]; accessory slips to other hyoid muscles are frequent.
