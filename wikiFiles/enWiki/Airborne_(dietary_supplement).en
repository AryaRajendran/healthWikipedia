'''Airborne''' is a [[dietary supplement]] containing [[herbal extract]]s, [[amino acids]], [[antioxidants]], [[electrolytes]], synthetic [[vitamin]]s, and other ingredients marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] supporting the [[immune system]], though the benefit to users remains unestablished. The former owners were fined by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for deceptive advertising and were the subject of successful class action lawsuits. Airborne was created by  Victoria Knight-McDowell in the early 1990s. It is offered for sale [[Over-the-counter substance|over-the-counter]] in many [[United States|U.S.]] retail stores in three different forms: tablet, chewable lozenge, or powder. 

== History ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2011}}
The formula for Airborne was developed by Victoria Knight-McDowell, a former  school teacher <ref name=Aug.14,08>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/08/airborne.shtm Makers of Airborne Settle FTC Charges of Deceptive Advertising; Agreement Brings Total Settlement Funds to $30 Million] For release August 14, 2008</ref> from [[Carmel, California]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}. She began brewing herbal and vitamin cocktails in the early 1990s and selling them in tablet form to local drug stores. Later on, Knight-McDowell contracted cartoonist [[Lloyd Dangle]] to create Airborne's brand and packaging{{cn|date=April 2013}}. In 1997 specialty grocery chain [[Trader Joe's]] ordered 300 cases{{cn|date=April 2013}} of Airborne tablets to sell, and by 1999 other larger chains, such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Rite Aid]], began stocking Airborne.

== Products ==
Airborne immune support supplements are available in three forms:  Original effervescent tablets which, when dissolved in water, offer fast-acting absorption, available in Zesty Orange, Lemon Lime, Pink Grapefruit and Very Berry flavors;  On-the-Go powder packets which are easily added to water bottles, in Lemonade and Very Berry flavors;  and new Airborne chewable tablets, which can be taken anytime without water, in Citrus and Berry flavors.

== Testing, research, and controversy ==
Although the manufacturer recommends that Airborne be taken "at the first sign of a cold symptom, or before entering crowded environments, like airplanes and offices," Airborne has not undergone any testing by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Furthermore, the manufacturer itself makes no actual claims with regard to user health (the claims are all along the lines of "all natural", "dissolves quickly", etc.) Because it is sold as a dietary supplement and not as a drug, current American law allows it to be marketed without prior review and approval of testing results that demonstrate that it provides a medical remedy. However, all claims on the label for consumer products have to be truthful and supported by scientific evidence.

There are no studies supporting Airborne's effectiveness that meet scientific standards.  The "GNG Pharmaceutical Services Inc." study often referenced in the debate over Airborne's effectiveness was sponsored by the Knight-McDowell Labs, manufacturers of Airborne.{{Ref|tcnj}}  In February 2006, [[ABC News]] discovered that GNG Pharmaceutical Services has no official clinic, scientists, or even doctors. In fact the company comprises only two men, who started the company just to perform this study. Because of the bad publicity that this controversy has brought forth, Knight-McDowell Labs has removed all references to the study from their packaging and web site.<ref>{{cite web

A medical report on  Airborne addressed some of these concerns, specifically regarding its large amounts of vitamin C:

<blockquote>There are some concerns. First, there is no conclusive evidence that this product or any of its ingredients prevents colds or shortens their duration. Second, the adult tablet contains 1 g of vitamin C, and the directions for use advise taking 1 tablet at the first sign of a cold and repeating the dose every 3 hours as necessary. Vitamin C in doses higher than 1 g increases oxalate and urate excretion and may cause [[kidney stones]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = J Am Soc Nephrol | year = 2004 | volume = 15 | pages = 3225–32 | doi = 10.1097/01.ASN.0000146012.44570.20 | pmid = 15579526 | last1 = Taylor | first1 = EN | last2 = Stampfer | first2 = MJ | last3 = Curhan | first3 = GC | title = Dietary factors and the risk of incident kidney stones in men: new insights after 14 years of follow-up | issue = 12 | unused_data = EN Taylor et al.}}</ref> Third, the safety of this herbal extraction combination has not been established.

=== Class action lawsuits and settlements ===
The former makers of Airborne had been accused by the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] of using [[false advertising]]<ref name=Aug.14,08>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/08/airborne.shtm Makers of Airborne Settle FTC Charges of Deceptive Advertising; Agreement Brings Total Settlement Funds to $30 Million] For release August 14, 2008</ref> in its marketing and making unproven claims<ref name=findlaw>[http://news.lp.findlaw.com/ap_stories/f/1310/12-16-2008/20081216090505_12.html Airborne paid an additional $7 million settlement]</ref> that it could help ward off harmful bacteria and germs and help prevent the [[Influenza|flu]] and the [[common cold]].

A class action lawsuit was filed against the former owners of Airborne Health, Inc. (and other defendants) alleging that Airborne falsely advertised certain therapeutic properties, including the ability to cure or prevent the common cold, when marketing products under the Airborne brand name. Defendants denied any wrongdoing or illegal conduct but have agreed to settle the litigation.<ref>{{cite web | title= Airborne Settlement|url=http://www.airbornehealthsettlement.com/|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

The [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI) participated in the class action lawsuit against Airborne. Their  senior nutritionist had this to say:

: "There's no credible evidence that what's in Airborne can prevent colds or protect you from a germy environment," said CSPI senior nutritionist David Schardt, who reviewed Airborne's claims. "Airborne is basically an overpriced, run-of-the-mill vitamin pill that's been cleverly, but deceptively, marketed."<ref name=Neutraceuticals_World>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb223/is_/ai_n29429374 CSPI participates in class action against the makers of Airborne]. ''Nutraceuticals World'', April, 2008,</ref>

On March 4, 2008, the former owners of Airborne Health Inc. agreed to pay $23.3 million to settle the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news | title = Airborne settles lawsuit for $23.3 million | publisher = CNN  | date = 2008-03-04 | url = http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/04/news/companies/airborne_settlement/?postversion=2008030413 | accessdate = 2008-03-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080307032716/http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/04/news/companies/airborne_settlement/?postversion=2008030413| archivedate= 7 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Customers with proof of purchase will be refunded for any Airborne they have ever bought. Those without proof of purchases will be reimbursed for up to six packages.  Any claims must have been postmarked or received prior to September 15, 2008 in order to be considered "timely".<ref>{{cite web | title = DAVID WILSON VS. AIRBORNE HEALTH, INC., ET AL | url=http://www.airbornehealthsettlement.com/docs/claim%20form.pdf | accessdate = 2008-03-06 |format=PDF}}</ref>

On August 14, 2008, a press release from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) stated that the former owners of Airborne Health, Inc. has agreed to pay up to $30 million to settle FTC charges. According to the FTC’s complaint:

: "there is no competent and reliable scientific evidence to support the claims made by the defendants that Airborne tablets can prevent or reduce the risk of colds, sickness, or infection; protect against or help fight germs; reduce the severity or duration of a cold; and protect against colds, sickness, or infection in crowded places such as airplanes, offices, or schools."

The FTC complaint also states that the company's former owners and founders, Victoria Knight-McDowell and Thomas John McDowell "made false claims that Airborne products are clinically proven to treat colds."<ref name="Aug.14,08"/>

Shortly after the settlements, a new management team was brought in to run the company. This management team was led by Marti Morfitt, former CEO and director of CNS, Inc. In October 2009, Airborne was purchased by GF Capital Management and Advisors, LLC – a New York City-based private equity firm. GF Capital said that the entire management team, including CEO Marti Morfitt, will remain intact.<ref name='GF_sale_2009'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Airborne Purchased by GF Capital | date=2009-10-12 | publisher=[[Reuters]] | url =http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS75820+12-Oct-2009+BW20091012 | work =Press Release | pages = | accessdate=2009-10-12 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091015162740/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS75820+12-Oct-2009+BW20091012| archivedate= 15 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  In March 2012, Schiff Nutrition acquired Airborne, Inc. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120402005634/en/Schiff-Nutrition-Acquires-Airborne-Leading-Brand-Immunity |title=Schiff Nutrition Acquires Airborne, Inc., a Leading Brand in Immunity Support |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>

==Ingredients==
According to the official website, Airborne contains a special blend of [[zinc]], [[ginger]], [[Echinacea]] and 13 other [[vitamins]], [[minerals]] and [[herbs]].<ref name="What's in Airborne">{{cite web|url=http://airbornehealth.com/about/whats-in-airborne| title=What's in Airborne |date=|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Each [[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] of Airborne contains 5 [[calories]].

The complete list of ingredients is the following:
* [[Vitamin A]] as [[retinyl palmitate]] According to the manufacturer's presentation of the product, Vitamin A supplementation supports the body's [[immune system]] by protecting the cell-mediated immunity and works synergistically with other [[antioxidants]] that support the immune system such as [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]], [[selenium]], and [[manganese]];
* Vitamin C ([[ascorbic acid]]) which, according to the official Airborne website, is needed to modulate the high levels of [[stress hormones]] and preserve the levels of vitamin C necessary to maintain a healthy immune system;
* [[Vitamin E]] (as [[delta-Tocopherol|delta-tocopheryl acetate]]) which boosts the immune system through its [[antioxidant]] properties that enhances and augments antibody production;<ref name="What's in Airborne"/>
* [[Riboflavin]] (vitamin B<sub>2</sub>) is claimed to have a role in the formation and functioning of some other vitamins;
* [[Magnesium]] (as [[magnesium oxide|oxide]] and [[magnesium sulfate|sulfate]]);
* [[Zinc]] (as [[zinc sulfate|sulfate]]);
* [[Selenium]] (as [[amino acid]] [[chelate]]);
* [[Manganese]] (as [[gluconate]]);
* [[Sodium]];
* [[Potassium]];
* Herbal extract proprietary blend containing: [[maltodextrin]], [[Lonicera]] (flower), [[Forsythia]] (fruit), [[Schizonepeta]] (aboveground parts), ginger (dried rhizome), Chinese Vitex (fruit), [[Isatis]] (root) and Echinacea (aboveground parts)
* [[Amino acids]]: [[glutamine]] (as <sub>L</sub>-glutamine) and [[lysine]] (as <sub>L</sub>-lysine HCl);
* Other ingredients: [[sorbitol]], [[citric acid]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[potassium bicarbonate]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] flavor, [[mineral oil]], [[acesulfame potassium]], and [[sucralose]].

However, it seems that Echinacea and vitamin C, the most commonly touted cold remedies, when tested in careful clinical studies, are ineffective in treating colds. Only Zinc, as a throat lozenge but not an effervescent tablet, has been effective in decreasing cold symptoms<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0816/is_3_23/ai_n19153244/| title=Deconstructing airborne: how to recognize medical nonsense|date=|accessdate=2010-04-26 | work=Pediatrics for Parents | first=Mark | last=Crislip | year=2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100506235033/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0816/is_3_23/ai_n19153244/| archivedate= 6 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the effectiveness of Airborne based on the zinc compound is in any case debatable given that a tablet contains only 10% of the daily recommended dose.

==Side effects==
The official website does not list any side effects that one might experience after taking Airborne, aside from "some sensitivity to any of the vitamins or herbal extracts".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airbornehealth.com/faqs/how-to-use/#faq_11|title=Are there any side effects from Airborne?|date=|accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100323061808/http://airbornehealth.com/faqs/how-to-use/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

People who might be allergic to one of the ingredients of the product are advised to avoid using it or consult a doctor before taking it. Also, people who are taking other type of [[medication]] at the same time or who suffer from different medical conditions are recommended to consult their physician before taking Airborne.

Side effects from vitamin overdoses may occur, especially in patients with [[kidney failure]]. On the other hand, the nutritional label of the original Airborne product stated that the amount of Vitamin A included in one tablet of the product represents 100% of the daily value. Yet, the manufacturers recommend that users should take a pill 3 times a day which means that they will exceed the recommended daily dose of Vitamin A by an extra 200%. Vitamin A toxicity can cause [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[irritability]], [[drowsiness]], [[altered mental status]], [[blurred vision]], [[headache]] and [[muscle pain]] and [[weakness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/126104-overview|title=Vitamin A Toxicity|date=|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> In very large doses, Vitamin C in kidney failure patients can cause severe side effects such as oxalate deposits in [[bone]] and [[soft tissues]] and may interfere with the absorption and [[metabolism]] of [[vitamin B12]]. Very high doses of vitamin E may produce [[headaches]], [[tiredness]], double vision, and [[diarrhea]] in humans and very high doses, higher than 800&nbsp;mg, may increase [[blood clotting]] time, especially for people on blood thinners. Also, magnesium overdose may occur and signs of magnesium toxicity can include changes in mental status, nausea, diarrhea, [[appetite loss]], [[muscle weakness]], [[difficulty breathing]], extremely [[low blood pressure]], and [[irregular heartbeat]].

==Dosing==
Airborne may be taken "whenever one feels his immune system needs support".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airbornehealth.com/faqs/how-to-use/#faq_1|title=How to Use|date=|accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100323061808/http://airbornehealth.com/faqs/how-to-use/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The tablets are intended to be dissolved into a glass of water and the dose can be repeated every 3 hours as necessary, without exceeding 2 doses in a day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airbornehealth.com/faqs/how-to-use/#faq_1|title=How do I take Airborne?|date=|accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100323061808/http://airbornehealth.com/faqs/how-to-use/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
