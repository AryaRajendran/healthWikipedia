The '''human skull''' is a [[bone|bony]] structure, part of the [[human skeleton|skeleton]], that is in the [[human head]] and which supports the structures of the face and forms a cavity for the [[Human brain|brain]].

The [[adult]] [[human]] [[skull]] is said to consist of two categorical parts of different [[embryology|embryological]] origins: The ''[[neurocranium]]'' and the ''[[viscerocranium]]''. The neurocranium (or ''braincase'') is a protective [[cranial vault|vault surrounding the brain]] and [[brain stem]]. The viscerocranium (also ''splanchnocranium'' or ''facial skeleton'') is formed by the bones supporting the [[face]].

Except for the [[Human mandible|mandible]],<ref>and the [[hyoid bone]], though this is not usually considered part of the skull</ref> all of the bones of the skull are joined together by [[sutures of skull|sutures]], [[synarthrosis|synarthrodial]] (immovable) [[joints]] formed by bony [[ossification]], with [[Sharpey's fibres]] permitting some flexibility.

Various sources provide different numbers for the count of constituent bones of the human neuro- and viscerocranium. The reasons for such counting discrepancies are numerous. Different [[textbook]]s classify the bones of the human skull differently, e.g. they may (also) include (parts of) bones that are ordinarily considered neurocranial bones in their list of facial bones. Some textbooks count paired bones (where there is one bone on each side) only once instead of twice. Some sources describe the [[maxilla]]'s left and right parts as two bones. Likewise, the [[palatine bone]] is also sometimes described as two bones. The [[hyoid bone]] is usually not considered part of the skull, as it does not [[Articulation (anatomy)|articulate]] with any other bones, but some sources include it. Some sources include the [[ossicles]], three of which on each side are encased within the [[temporal bone]]s, though these are also usually not considered part of the skull. Extra [[sutural bones]] may also variably be present, but they are not counted. For all of these reasons, it may not be easy<ref>or even very useful</ref> to reach agreement on an authoritative bone count for the neuro- and viscerocranium and the human skull. However, such discrepancies between various sources are only differences in how to classify and/or describe the anatomy of the human skull, and regardless of what classification/description is used, the basic anatomy remains the same. With that in mind, as one possible classification, the human skull could for example be said to consist of twenty two bones: Eight bones of the neurocranium ([[occipital bone]], 2 [[temporal bone]]s, 2 [[parietal bone]]s, [[sphenoid bone]], [[ethmoid bone]], [[frontal bone]]), and fourteen bones of the viscerocranium ([[vomer]], 2 [[conchae]], 2 [[nasal bone]]s, 2 [[maxilla]], [[mandible]], 2 [[palatine bone]], 2 [[zygomatic bone]]s, 2 [[lacrimal bone]]s).

The skull also contains the [[sinus cavity|sinus cavities]], which are air-filled cavities lined with [[respiratory epithelium]], which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are debatable; they contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength, they contribute to resonance of the voice, and assist in the warming and moistening of air drawn in through the nasal cavity.

==Development of the skull==
[[Image:fetal skull11w.jpg|thumb|The lower inner surface of the neurocranium- 11 weeks' fertilization age]]
The skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by [[intramembranous ossification|intramembranous]] and [[endochondral ossification]]. The [[skull roof]], comprising the bones of the splanchnocranium (face) and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, is formed by intramembranous (or ''dermal'') ossification, though the [[temporal bone]]s are formed by endochondral ossification. The [[endocranium]], the bones supporting the brain (the [[occipital bone|occipital]], [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], and [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]]) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous.<ref>{{cite book |title= Human Embryology & Developmental Biology|last= Carlson|first= Bruce M.|authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Mosby |location= |isbn=0-8151-1458-3 |page= |pages=166–170 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> The geometry of the cranial base and its fossas: [[anterior cranial fossa|anterior]], [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior]] changes rapidly, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. The first trimester is crucial for development of skull defects.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Wojciech |last1=Derkowski |first2=Alicja |last2=Kędzia |first3=Michał |last3=Glonek |pmid=14507064 |url=http://www.fm.viamedica.pl/darmowy_pdf.phtml?indeks=25&indeks_art=369 |year=2003 |title=Clinical anatomy of the human anterior cranial fossa during the prenatal period |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=271–3 |journal=Folia morphologica}}</ref>

At birth, the human skull is made up of 44 separate bony elements. As growth occurs, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the [[frontal bone]]). The bones of the [[skull roof|roof of the skull]] are initially separated by regions of dense [[connective tissue]] called "[[fontanels]]". There are six [[fontanels]]: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the "obstetrical hinge", which is where the [[Squama occipitalis|squamous]] and [[Lateral parts of occipital bone|lateral parts]] of the [[occipital bone]] meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the [[Great cerebral vein|great cerebral vein of Galen]]. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating [[Suture (anatomical)|suture]]s. The five sutures are the two squamous, one coronal, one lambdoid, and one sagittal sutures. The posterior fontanel usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanel is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a "soft spot" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing his or her pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanel.

== Pathology ==
If the brain is bruised or injured it can be life-threatening. Normally the skull protects the brain from damage through its hard unyieldingness; the skull is one of the least deformable structures found in nature with it needing the force of about 1 ton{{Clarify|reason=unit of mass, not a unit of force|date=March 2013}} to reduce the diameter of the skull by 1&nbsp;cm.<ref>Holbourn, A. H. S. (1943). MECHANICS OF HEAD INJURIES. The Lancet, 242: (6267), 438-441. {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(00)87453-X}}</ref> In some cases, however, of [[head injury]], there can be raised [[intracranial pressure]] through mechanisms such as a [[subdural haematoma]]. In these cases the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the [[foramen magnum]] ("coning") because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant [[brain damage]] or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with [[concussion]] must be watched extremely carefully.

Dating back to [[Neolithic]] times, a skull operation called [[trepanation]] was sometimes performed. This involved drilling holes in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the "patients" sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanation was performed for ritualistic or religious reasons and not only as an attempted life-saving technique.

== Craniometry and morphology of human skulls ==
Like the face of a living individual, a human skull and teeth can also tell, to a certain degree, the life history and origin of its owner. [[forensics|Forensic]] scientists and [[archeology|archaeologist]]s use  [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and nonmetric traits to estimate what the bearer of the skull looked like. When a significant amount of bones are found, such as at [[Spitalfields]] in the UK and [[Jōmon]] [[shell mound]]s in Japan, [[Osteology|osteologists]] can use traits, such as the proportions of length, height and width, to know the relationships of the population of the study with other living or extinct populations.

The German physician [[Franz Joseph Gall]] in around 1800 formulated the theory of [[phrenology]], which attempted to show that specific features of the skull are associated with certain personality traits or intellectual capabilities of its owner. This theory is now considered to be obsolete.

== Sexual dimorphism ==
In the past, specifically in the mid-nineteenth century, anthropologists found it crucial to distinguish between male and female skulls. An anthropologist of the time, McGrigor Allan, argued that the female brain was similar to that of an animal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fee|first=Elizabeth|title=Nineteenth-Century Craniology: The Study of the Female Skull.|year=1979|pages=415–473}}</ref>  This allowed anthropologists to declare that women were in fact more emotional and less like their rational male counterparts.  McGrigor then concluded that women’s brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time.<ref name="Fee 1979 415–453">{{cite book|last=Fee|first=Elizabeth|title=Nineteenth-Century Craniology: The Study of the Female Skull.|year=1979|pages=415–453}}</ref>  To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull. These cranial measurements are the basis of what is known as [[craniology]].  These cranial measurements were also used to draw a connection between females and Negroes.  French craniologist, F. Pruner, went on to describe this relationship as: “The Negro resemble[ing] the female in his love for children, his family, and his cabin".<ref name="Fee 1979 415–453"/>  Pruner also went on to say that the negro is what the female is to the white man, “a loving being and a being of pleasure”.<ref name="Fee 1979 415–453"/>  New forms of cranial measurement continued to progress well into the early twentieth century in an effort to further implement the sexual dimorphism between male and female skulls.

Research today shows that while in early life there is little difference between male and female skulls, in adulthood male skulls tend to be larger and more robust than female skulls, which are lighter and smaller, with a cranial capacity about 10 percent less than that of the male.<ref name="The Interior of the Skull">{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_interior_of_the_skull.html |title=The Interior of the Skull
 |work=Gray's Anatomy |accessdate=2010-111-28}}</ref> However, new studies show that women's skulls are thicker and thus men may be more susceptible to head injury than women.<ref name="Men May Be More Susceptible To Head Injury Than Women, Study Suggests">{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080121122138.htm|title=Men May Be More Susceptible To Head Injury Than Women, Study Suggests|work=Science Daily |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Investigation of the critical geometric characteristics of living human skulls utilising medical image analysis techniques | author=Li, Ruan, Xie, and Wang | journal=International Journal of Vehicle Safety | year=2007 | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=345–367 | doi=10.1504/IJVS.2007.016747}}</ref>  The male body is larger than the female body, which accounts for the larger size of the male skull; proportionally, the male skull is about the same size as the female skull. Male skulls typically have more prominent [[supraorbital ridge]]s, a more prominent [[glabella]], and more prominent [[parietal bone|temporal lines]]. Female skulls generally have rounder [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]s, and narrower jaws. Male skulls on average have larger, broader [[palate]]s, squarer [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]s, larger [[mastoid process]]es, larger [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]]es, and larger [[occipital condyle]]s than those of females. Male [[Human mandible|mandibles]] typically have squarer chins and thicker, rougher muscle attachments than female mandibles.
