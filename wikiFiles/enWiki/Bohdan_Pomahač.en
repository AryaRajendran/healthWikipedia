'''Bohdan Pomahač''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈboɦdan ˈpomaɦatʃ}}; born 1971) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[plastic surgeon]]. He led the team that performed the first full [[face transplant]] in [[United States]] and the third overall in the world.<ref name="Herald Sun"/>

==Biography==
Pomahač's parents were a chemical engineer and a school teacher.  The family lived in the industrial city of [[Ostrava]], today's [[Czech Republic]], in a small three-room apartment, and used to spend weekends at their weekend house in [[Morávka (Frýdek-Místek District)|Morávka]], a municipality in the [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]] mountain range.<ref name="cztv">{{cz icon}}{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/10289904114-tvare-jsou-zrcadla-nasich-zivotu/210542151200001/|title=Tváře jsou zrcadla našich životů|accessdate=2011-03-23|work=Česká televize}}</ref>

As a teenager, Pomahač became a passionate chess player, devoting as many as 40 hours a week to his hobby. He was inspired by [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Garry Kasparov]] and made it to the major chess league in the country.<ref name="cztv"/>

After finishing high school in Ostrava, Pomahač became a student at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]] [[Palacký_University_of_Olomouc#Medicine_and_Dentistry|Faculty of Medicine]]. During the 6 years study, Pomahač went on [[Student exchange program|exchange]] to [[Boston]], [[USA]], which influenced his subsequent career choice.<ref name="cztv"/>

Pomahač left for the USA immediately after finishing his studies in the Czech Republic in 1996. He was employed at the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], where he worked for 90-120 hours a week.<ref name="cztv"/>

In 2000, Pomahač married Hana Augustinová, an eye doctor and also a Palacký University of Olomouc graduate. Together with their two children they live in [[Dover, Massachusetts|Dover]], a small village not far from Boston. They visit the [[Czech Republic]] once a year, when their children undergo Czech language tests in a school.<ref name="cztv"/>

===Face transplants===
{{main|Isabelle Dinoire|Dallas Wiens}}
Although face transplants were not the centre of his research work, by 2004 he became increasingly interested in the subject and devoted much of his free time to it. Great incentive came when Pomahač met [[Isabelle Dinoire]], the first person to undergo partial face transplant in 2005 in [[France]]. Dinoire told him that if the face had not been accepted, she was ready to undergo the procedure again.<ref name="cztv"/> When Pomahač asked another patient why he sought repeated surgery, he told the doctor: “I just want a cab to stop when I’m at the curb.”<ref name="post">{{en icon}}{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/boston-hospital-team-performs-first-full-face-transplant-in-us/2011/03/21/AB9SD68_story.html|title=Boston hospital team performs first full face transplant in U.S.|accessdate=2011-03-23|work=The Washington Post|first=Thomas S.|last=Monson|date=2011-03-22}}</ref>

In 2007 Pomahač became the head of the hospital's burn trauma centre and also head of the team specializing in facial transplants.

On April 9, 2009  Pomahač performed the second partial face transplant in the USA (and seventh in the world). During a 17-hour operation, a surgical team led by Pomahač, replaced the nose, upper lip, cheeks, and roof of the mouth - along with corresponding muscles, bones and nerves - of James Maki, age 59. Mr. Maki's face was severely injured after falling onto the electrified third rail at a Boston subway station in 2005. In May 2009, he made a public media appearance and declared he was happy with the result.<ref>{{en icon}}{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1186170/Face-transplant-man-reveals-joy-new-look-years-falling-electrified-rail-line.html|title=Face transplant man reveals joy of new look five years after falling on electrified rail line|accessdate=2011-03-23|work=Mail Online|location=London|first=Julian|last=Gavaghan|date=2009-05-22}}</ref> This procedure was also shown in the eighth episode of the ABC documentary series ''[[Boston Med]]''.

After that procedure was successfully completed, the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] awarded a $3.4 million grant to the hospital in December 2009 to fund five face transplants, according to Col. Janet Harris, director of the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program for the Army Medical Research and Material Command.<ref name="post"/>

On March 22, 2011, Pomahač performed the first full face transplant in the USA (and third in the world, after [[Face_transplant#Full_face_transplant|full face transplants in Spain and France]]) on [[Dallas Wiens]], 25, who was injured by an electric shock that removed his face. Pomahač led the team of physicians, nurses and anaesthesiologists for more than 15 hours to replace Mr Wiens's nose, lips, facial skin, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them to provide sensation.<ref name="Herald Sun">{{en icon}}{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/burned-dad-faces-up-to-life-as-marvel/story-e6frf7lf-1226026439013|title=David Wiens given first full face transplant in the US|accessdate=2011-03-23|work=Herald Sun}}</ref>

Two other patients are already on the list for other operations funded by the Defense Department. They are Mitch Hunter of Indianapolis, an Army veteran who was in a car crash after his Army stint, and Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman who lost her hands, nose, lips and eyelids in 2009 when she was mauled by a chimpanzee.<ref name="post"/>

== Historical connections to transplantations ==
Pomahač studied at the  [[Palacký University of Olomouc]] [[Palacký_University_of_Olomouc#Medicine_and_Dentistry|Faculty of Medicine]]. The University conducts practical education in [[Olomouc]] hospital, where the world's first successful human [[organ transplant]] was performed by [[Eduard Zirm|Eduard Konrad Zirm]] in 1905.<ref>{{de icon}}{{Cite web|url=http://www.drzirm.org/|title=Die erste erfolgreiche Organtransplantation durchgeführt von Dr. Eduard Konrad Zirm - 7. Dezember 1905|accessdate=2011-03-23|work=drzirm.org}}</ref>

[[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], where Pomahač works, was the place of the second successful human [[organ transplant]] performed by [[Joseph Murray]] in 1954.

=== Etymology ===
"''Pomahač''" means "''helper''" and forename "[http://krestni-jmena.cz/vyznam/?name=Bohdan Bohdan]" means gift of God or given by God in the [[Czech language]].
