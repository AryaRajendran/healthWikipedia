The '''pyramidal tracts''' refers to both the '''corticospinal''' and [[corticobulbar tract|'''corticobulbar''' tracts]].

The '''corticospinal''' tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It contains mostly [[axon]]s originated from the motor cortex. The corticospinal tract is made up of two separate tracts in the spinal cord: the [[lateral corticospinal tract]] and the [[anterior corticospinal tract]]. The corticospinal tract also contains the [[Betz Cell]] (the largest pyramidal cells) that are not found in any other region of the body. An understanding of these tracts leads to an understanding of why one side of the body is controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract is concerned specifically with discrete voluntary skilled movements, such as precise movement of the fingers and toes. The brain sends impulses to the spinal cord relaying the message. This is imperative in understanding that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, while the right hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body. The signals cross in the [[medulla oblongata]], this process is also known as decussation. 

The [[corticobulbar tract]] carries information to motor neurons of the cranial nerve nuclei, rather than the spinal cord.<ref>Chapter 9 of "Principles of Physiology" (3rd edition) by Robert M. Berne and Mathew N. Levy. Published by Mosby, Inc. (2000) ISBN 0-323-00813-5.</ref>

==The motor pathway==
The corticospinal tract originates from [[pyramidal cells]] in layer V of the [[cerebral cortex]]. About half of its fibres arise from the [[primary motor cortex]]. Other contributions come from the [[supplementary motor area]], [[premotor cortex]], [[somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal lobe]], and [[cingulate gyrus]]. The average fiber diameter is in the region of 10μm; around 3% of fibres are extra-large (20μm) and arise from [[Betz cell]]s, mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex.

===Upper motor neurons===
The neuronal cell bodies in the [[motor cortex]], together with their axons that travel down through the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]] are commonly referred to as [[upper motor neuron]]s.

====Decussation and synapses====
Some of the [[neuron]]al cell bodies in the motor cortex send long axons to the motor [[cranial nerve]] nuclei mainly of the contralateral side of the [[midbrain]] ([[cortico-mesencephalic tract]]), [[pons]] ([[Corticopontine tract]]), and [[medulla oblongata]] ([[cortico-bulbar tract]]), decussating just before they reach their target nuclei. These are called [[geniculate fibers]]. Many more motor cortex neurons, however, extend fibers all the way down to the [[spinal cord]] (corticospinal tract).

* Most of the corticospinal fibers (about 80%) cross over to the contralateral side in the [[medulla oblongata]] ([[pyramidal decussation]]). Those that cross in the medulla oblongata travel in the [[lateral corticospinal tract]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
* 10% Enter <!--Or "Ten percent enter-->the lateral corticospinal tract on the same side.
* The remainder of them (10%) travel in the [[anterior corticospinal tract]].  The majority of fibers from this tract cross over near the level that they exit the [[spinal cord]], however a small portion will synapse in the anterior horn on the ipsilateral side. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Whichever of these two tracts it travels in, a corticospinal [[axon]] will [[synapse]] with another neuron in the [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|ventral horn]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. This ventral horn neuron is considered a second-order neuron in this pathway, but is not part of the corticospinal tract itself.

====From cerebral to motor neurons====
The motor axons move closer together as they travel down through the cerebral [[white matter]], and form part of the ''posterior limb'' of the [[internal capsule]].

The motor fibers continue down into the [[brainstem]]. The bundle of corticospinal axons is visible as two column-like structures ("[[Pyramid of medulla oblongata|pyramids]]") on the ventral surface of [[medulla oblongata]]. However, the name '''pyramidal tract''' comes from the pyramidal/conical shape of the neuron cell bodies (soma) that comprise it.

After the decussation, the axons travel down the [[spinal cord]] as the [[lateral corticospinal tract]]. Fibers that do not cross over in the [[medulla oblongata]] travel down the separate [[anterior corticospinal tract]], and most of them cross over to the contralateral side in the [[spinal cord]], shortly before reaching the [[lower motor neuron]]s.

===Lower motor neurons===
In the spinal cord, the axons of the upper motor neuron connect (most of them via [[interneurons]], but to a lesser extent also via direct [[synapse]]s) with the [[lower motor neuron]]s, located in the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|ventral horn]] of the spinal cord. 

In the [[brain stem]], the [[lower motor neuron]]s are located in the motor [[cranial nerve]] nuclei ([[oculomotor]], [[trochlear]], motor nucleus of the [[trigeminal nerve]], [[abducens]], [[facial nerve]], [[Accessory nerve|accessory]], [[hypoglossal]]). The [[lower motor neuron]] [[axons]] leave the [[brain stem]] via motor [[cranial nerves]] and the [[spinal cord]] via anterior roots of the [[spinal nerve]]s, respectively, ending up at the [[neuromuscular plate]] and providing motor innervation for voluntary muscles.

* [[Spinocerebellar tract]]
* [[Visual pathway]]
* [[Olfactory system]]
* [[Posterior column pathway]]

==Corticospinal tract damage==
Damage to the descending motor pathways anywhere along the trajectory from the cerebral cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord gives rise to a set of symptoms called the "[[Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome]]". A few days after the injury to the upper motor neurons, a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears, including [[spasticity]], the decreased vigor (and increased threshold) of superficial [[reflexes]], a loss of the ability to perform [[dexterity|fine movements]], and an [[extensor]] [[plantar]] response known as the [[Babinski sign]].<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=neurosci&part=A1191</ref>

==Neurons==
The [[neurons]] of the these tracts are referred to as pyramidal tract neurons (PTN), because their axons form part of the pyramidal tracts leading to the spinal cord (or the cranial nerve nuclei with the corticobulbar tract), which in turn are named such because in cross-section they resemble pyramids as they pass through the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]].<ref>[http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_06/a_06_cl/a_06_cl_mou/a_06_cl_mou.html The Brain From Top To Bottom<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Pyramidal tract neurons, however, are not to be confused with [[pyramidal neurons]]: a super-class of neurons, found in many parts of the brain including the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, whose name derives from the pyramid-like shape of the cell body (soma). In fact, corticospinal neurons are both pyramidal tract neurons (because their axons pass through the medullary pyramids) and [[pyramidal neurons]] (because their cell body is shaped like a pyramid).

==Extrapyramidal motor pathways==
These are motor pathways that lie outside the corticospinal tract and are beyond voluntary control. Their main function is to support voluntary movement and help control posture and [[muscle tone]]. See [[extrapyramidal motor system]].
