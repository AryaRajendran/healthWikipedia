'''Cardiomyopathy''' (literally "heart muscle disease") is the measurable deterioration of the function of the [[myocardium]] (the heart muscle) for any reason, usually leading to [[heart failure]]; common symptoms are [[dyspnea]] (breathlessness) and [[peripheral edema]] (swelling of the legs). People with cardiomyopathy are often at risk of dangerous forms of [[arrhythmia|irregular heart beat]] and [[sudden cardiac death]].<ref name="ref1">{{cite book | last = Kasper | first = Denis Lh.

* An ''extrinsic'' cardiomyopathy is a cardiomyopathy where the primary [[pathology]] is outside the myocardium itself. Most cardiomyopathies are extrinsic, by far the most common cause of an extrinsic cardiomyopathy is [[ischemia]]. Ischemia can be understood as poor oxygen supply of the heart muscle (the demand for oxygen is higher than the current supply). The World Health Organization calls these ''specific cardiomyopathies'':<ref name="ref2" />

* An ''intrinsic'' cardiomyopathy is defined as weakness in the muscle of the heart not due to an identifiable external cause.  This definition was used to categorize previously idiopathic cardiomyopathies although specific external causes have since been identified for many.  For example, alcoholism has been identified as a cause for some forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. To make a diagnosis of an intrinsic cardiomyopathy, significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out first (amongst other causes).  The term intrinsic cardiomyopathy does not describe the specific [[etiology]] of weakened heart muscle.  The intrinsic cardiomyopathies consist of a variety of disease states, each with their own causes. Many intrinsic cardiomyopathies now have identifiable external causes including [[medication|drug]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]] toxicity, certain [[infection]]s (including [[Hepatitis C]]), and various [[genetics|genetic]] and [[idiopathic]] (i.e., unknown) causes.

It is also possible to classify cardiomyopathies functionally, as involving dilation, hypertrophy, or restriction.<ref name="FusterHurst2004">{{cite book|author1=Valentin Fuster|author2=John Willis Hurst|title=Hurst's the heart|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eWQAJDrVV7gC&pg=PA1884|accessdate=11 November 2010|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-143225-2|pages=1884–}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
{{refimprove|date=April 2012}}
Symptoms and signs may mimic those of almost any form of heart disease. Chest pain is common. Mild myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is frequently asymptomatic; severe cases are associated with heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic embolization. Manifestations of the underlying disease (e.g., [[Chagas' disease]]) may be prominent. Most patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis report a recent viral [[prodrome]] preceding cardiovascular symptoms.

EKG abnormalities are often present, although the changes are frequently nonspecific. A pattern characteristic of left ventricular hypertrophy may be present. Flat or inverted [[T wave]]s are most common, often with low-voltage [[QRS complex]]es. Intraventricular conduction defects and bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, are also common. An echocardiogram is useful to detect wall motion abnormalities or a pericardial effusion. Chest radiographs can be normal or can show evidence of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and condition of disease, but may include medication (conservative treatment) or iatrogenic/implanted [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] for slow heart rates, [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|defibrillators]] for those prone to fatal heart rhythms, [[ventricular assist device]]s (LVADs) for severe heart failure, or [[ablation]] for recurring dysrhythmias that cannot be eliminated by medication or cardioversion. The goal of treatment is often symptom relief, and some patients may eventually require a [[heart transplant]]. Treatment of cardiomyopathy (and other heart diseases) using alternative methods such as [[stem cell therapy]] is commercially available but is not supported by convincing evidence.
