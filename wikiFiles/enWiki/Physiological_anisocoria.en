'''Physiological anisocoria''' is when human [[pupil]]s differ in size. It is generally considered to be benign, though it must be distinguished from [[Congenital Horner's syndrome]], pharmacological dilatation or other conditions connected to the [[sympathetic nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doetsch|first=H.|title=Anisocoria as a physiological phenomenon|journal=Art Wochensch.|year=1950|month=May|volume=26|series=5|issue=20|pages=331–3}}{{update inline|date=December 2012}}</ref>
The prevalence of physiological anisocoria has not been found to be influenced by the sex, age, or [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] color of the subject.

==Characteristics==
The main characteristic that distinguishes physiological anisocoria is an increase of pupil size with lower light or reduced illumination, such that the pupils differ in size between the two eyes. At any given eye examination, up to 41% of healthy patients can shown an anisocoria of 0.4&nbsp;mm or more at one time or another. It can also occur as the difference between both pupils varies from day to day.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Corbett|first=J.|coauthors=Lam BL, Thompson HS|title=The prevalence of simple anisocoria|journal=Am J Ophthalmol.|date=15|year=1987|month=July|volume=104|issue=1|pages=69–73.|pmid=3605282}}</ref>  A normal population survey showed that during poor light or near dark conditions, differences of 1&nbsp;mm on average between pupils was found.<ref>{{cite journal|last=London|first=Richard|coauthors=Ellen Richrer Erringer, Harry J.

The presence of physiologic anisocoria has been estimated at 20% of the normal population, so some degree of pupil difference may be expected in at least 1 in 5 clinic patients.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Causes==
When detected during childhood, without any other symptoms and when other disorders are discarded through clinical tests, it should be considered a developmental or genetic phenomena.
Asymmetric pupil or dyscoria, potential causes of anisocoria, refer to an abnormal shape of the pupil which can happens due to developmental and intrauterine anomalies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Optometry College|first=.|title=Pupil Anomalies: Reaction and Red Flags|url=http://www.pacificu.edu/optometry/ce/courses/19433/pupilanompg2.cfm|publisher=Pacifica University Oregon|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>
