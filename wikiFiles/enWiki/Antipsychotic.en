[[File:Zyprexa.PNG|thumb|right|[[Olanzapine]] (Zyprexa), an example of a second-generation antipsychotic]]
An '''antipsychotic''' (or '''neuroleptic''') is a [[psychiatric medication]] primarily used to manage [[psychosis]] (including [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s, or [[disordered thought]]), particularly in [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], and is increasingly being used in the management of non-psychotic disorders ([[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System|ATC]] code N05A). A first generation of antipsychotics, known as [[typical antipsychotics]], was discovered in the 1950s. Most of the drugs in the second generation, known as [[atypical antipsychotics]], have been developed more recently, although the first atypical antipsychotic, [[clozapine]], was discovered in the 1950s and introduced clinically in the 1970s. Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's [[dopamine pathway]]s, but atypicals tend to act on [[serotonin]] as well.

A number of [[adverse effect|(adverse)]] effects have been observed, including [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] effects on [[motor control]]&nbsp;– including [[akathisia]] (constant discomfort to a varying degree causing restlessness), [[tremor]], and [[dystonia|abnormal muscle contractions]]), an involuntary movement disorder known as [[tardive dyskinesia]], and elevations in [[prolactin]] (resulting in [[gynecomastia|breast enlargement]] in men, [[galactorrhea|breast milk discharge]], or sexual dysfunction).<ref name="Stahl">{{cite book|author= Stahl, S. M. | title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2008}}</ref> Some atypical antipsychotics have been associated with [[metabolic syndrome]] and, in the case of [[clozapine]], lowered [[white blood cell]] counts.<ref name="Stahl"/> Some studies have suggested antipsychotics may be associated with a decrease in [[life expectancy]] of 20%. Antipsychotics profoundly reduce brain functioning i.e. intelligence and memory to the extent the that patient can not work or study while receiving treatment. Minor decreases in brain volume have been reported.

In some instances a return of psychosis can occur, requiring increasing the dosage, due to cells producing more neurochemicals to compensate for the drugs ([[Tardive Psychosis|tardive psychosis]]), and there is a potential for permanent [[chemical dependence]] leading to psychosis worse than before treatment began, if the drug dosage is ever lowered or stopped ([[tardive dysphrenia]]).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442101 Extrapyramidal motor side-effects of first- ... [Br J Psychiatry. 2012&#93; - PubMed - NCBI]. Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (4 April 2012).</ref> Most side-effects disappear rapidly once the medication is discontinued or reduced, but others, particularly tardive dyskinesia, may be irreversible.

Temporary withdrawal symptoms including insomnia, agitation, psychosis, and motor disorders may occur during dosage reduction of antipsychotics, and can be mistaken for a return of the underlying condition.<ref name="Dilsaver-1988"/><ref name="Moncrieff-2006"/>

The development of new antipsychotics with fewer of these adverse effects and with greater relative effectiveness as compared to existing antipsychotics ([[efficacy]]), is an ongoing field of research. Sometimes, however, patients are switched back to typical antipsychotics because the newer ones are less effective in those patients.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Medical uses==
Common conditions with which antipsychotics might be used include [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[delusional disorder]]. Antipsychotics might also be used to counter psychosis associated with a wide range of other diagnoses, such as [[psychotic depression]]. However, not all symptoms require treatment with medication, and hallucinations and delusions should only be treated if they cause distress or dysfunction for the patient.<ref name="alcouncil.com">[http://www.alcouncil.com/docs/2008Conference/handouts/powers/Choosing%20the%20right%20neuroleptic%20for%20a%20patient.pdf Choosing the right neuroleptic for a Patient (2008)]. (PDF) .</ref>

In addition, antipsychotics are increasingly used to treat non-psychotic disorders. For example, they are sometimes used [[off-label use|off-label]] to manage aspects of [[Tourette syndrome]] or [[autism spectrum disorder]]s. They have multiple off-label uses as an [[augmentation (psychiatry)|augmentation]] agent (i.e. in addition to another medication), for example in "treatment-resistant" depression<ref>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:EdQ-6N0zzc4J:www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0306.pdf+antipsychotics+atypical+depression&hl=en&gl=us&sig=AHIEtbReoz7KlvOCNxeRQQ6XTnW0Tx5KDw Docs.Google.com]</ref> or [[OCD]].<ref>[http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=52416. Focus.psychiatryonline.org.</ref> Off-label uses of antipsychotics may include depression, anxiety, mood stabilization, cognitive enhancement, management of aggression, impulsivity, or suicidality, or sleep.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Groleger U |title=Off-label use of antipsychotics: rethinking 'off-label' |journal=Psychiatria Danubina |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=350–3 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18000487}}</ref>

Antipsychotics have also been increasingly used off-label in cases of [[dementia]] in older people, and for various disorders and difficulties in children and teenagers. A survey of children with [[pervasive developmental disorder]] found that 16.5% were taking an antipsychotic drug, most commonly to alleviate mood and behavioral disturbances characterized by irritability, aggression, and agitation. Recently, risperidone was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autism.<ref>[http://www.jci.org/articles/view/32483 Antipsychotics in the treatment of autism (2008)]. Jci.org (2 January 2008).</ref>

Antipsychotics are sometimes administered as part of compulsory psychiatric treatment via [[involuntary commitment|inpatient (hospital) commitment]] or [[outpatient commitment]]. They may be administered orally or, in some cases, through long-acting (depot) injections administered in the [[dorsogluteal muscle|dorsgluteal]], [[ventrogluteal area|ventrogluteal]] or [[deltoid muscle]].

===Efficacy===
There have been a large number of studies of the [[efficacy]] of typical antipsychotics, and an increasing number on the more recent atypical antipsychotics.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommend antipsychotics for managing acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and as a longer-term maintenance treatment for reducing the likelihood of further episodes.<ref>American Psychiatric Association (2004) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia. Second Edition.</ref><ref>The Royal College of Psychiatrists & The British Psychological Society (2003). [http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=289559 ''Schizophrenia. Full national clinical guideline on core interventions in primary and secondary care''] (PDF). London: Gaskell and the British Psychological Society.</ref> They state that response to any given antipsychotic can be variable so that trials may be necessary, and that lower doses are to be preferred where possible. A number of studies have looked at levels of "compliance" or "adherence" with antipsychotic regimes and found that discontinuation (stopping taking them) by patients is associated with higher rates of relapse, including hospitalization.

Nevertheless, a 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of trials in people diagnosed with schizophrenia found that less than half (41%) showed any therapeutic response to an antipsychotic, compared to 24% on placebo, and that there was a decline in treatment response over time, and possibly a bias in which trial results were published.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v14/n4/abs/4002136a.html How effective are second-generation antipsychotic drugs?

Nature.com.</ref> In addition, a 2010 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review of trials of Risperidone, one of the biggest selling antipsychotics and the first of the new generation to become available in [[generic drug|generic]] form, found only marginal benefit compared with placebo and that, despite its widespread use, evidence remains limited, poorly reported and probably biased in favor of risperidone due to pharmaceutical company funding of trials.<ref>[http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/Evidence/Drug-Specific-Reviews/Cochrane-review-Risperidone-versus-placebo-for-schizophrenia/Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia.

Antipsychotic [[polypharmacy]] (prescribing two or more antipsychotics at the same time for an individual) is said to be a common practice but not necessarily evidence-based or recommended, and there have been initiatives to curtail it.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Patrick V, Levin E, Schleifer S |title=Antipsychotic polypharmacy: is there evidence for its use? |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Practice |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=248–57 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=16041235|doi=10.1097/00131746-200507000-00005}}</ref> Similarly, the use of excessively high doses (often the result of polypharmacy) continues despite clinical guidelines and evidence indicating that it is usually no more effective but is usually more harmful.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ito H, Koyama A, Higuchi T |title=Polypharmacy and excessive dosing: psychiatrists' perceptions of antipsychotic drug prescription |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=187|pages=243–7 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16135861 |doi=10.1192/bjp.187.3.243|issue=3}}</ref>

A review by the US [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] found that much of the evidence for the off-label use of antipsychotics (for example, for depression, dementia, OCD, PTSD, Personality Disorders, Tourette's) was of insufficient scientific quality to support such use, especially as there was strong evidence of increased risks of stroke, tremors, significant weight gain, sedation, and gastrointestinal problems.<ref>[http://www.ahrq.gov/news/press/pr2007/antipsypr.htmEvidence Lacking to Support Many Off-label Uses of Atypical Antipsychotics (2007)]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}.

Aggressive challenging behavior in adults with [[intellectual disability]] is often treated with antipsychotic drugs despite lack of an evidence base. A recent [[randomized controlled trial]], however, found no benefit over [[placebo]] and recommended that the use of antipsychotics in this way should no longer be regarded as an acceptable routine treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Romeo R, Knapp M, Tyrer P, Crawford M, Oliver-Africano P |title=The treatment of challenging behaviour in intellectual disabilities: cost-effectiveness analysis |journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=633–43 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19460067 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01180.x}}</ref>

A 2006 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review of controlled trials of antipsychotics in old age [[dementia]] reported that one or two of the drugs showed a modest benefit compared to placebo in managing aggression or psychosis, but that this was combined with a significant increase in serious adverse events. They concluded that this confirms that antipsychotics should not be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis, but may be an option in the minority of cases where there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atypical antipsychotics for aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003476.pub2/abstract|work=The Cochrane Collaboration.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|accessdate=27 July 2012|author=Clive G Ballard , Jonathan Waite, Jacqueline Birks|format=Abstract|date=8|month=October|year=2008}}</ref>

Some doubts have been raised about the long-term effectiveness of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, in part because two large international [[World Health Organization]] studies found individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to have better long-term outcomes in developing countries (where there is lower availability and use of antipsychotics and mental health problems are treated with more informal, community-led methods only) than in developed countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jablensky A, Sartorius N, Ernberg G, Anker M, Korten A, Cooper J, Day R, Bertelsen A |title=Schizophrenia: manifestations, incidence and course in different cultures.

Some argue that the evidence for antipsychotics from discontinuation-relapse studies may be flawed, because they do not take into account that antipsychotics may sensitize the brain and provoke psychosis if discontinued, which may then be wrongly interpreted as a relapse of the original condition.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Moncrieff J |title=Does antipsychotic withdrawal provoke psychosis?

A review of the methods used in trials of antipsychotics, despite stating that the overall quality is "rather good," reported issues with the selection of participants (including that in schizophrenia trials up to 90% of people who are generally suitable do not meet the elaborate inclusion and exclusion criteria, and that negative symptoms have not been properly assessed despite companies marketing the newer antipsychotics for these); issues with the design of trials (including pharmaceutical company funding of most of them, and inadequate [[blind experiment|experimental "blinding"]] so that trial participants could sometimes tell whether they were on placebo or not); and issues with the assessment of outcomes (including the use of a minimal reduction in scores to show "response," lack of assessment of quality of life or recovery, a high rate of discontinuation, selective highlighting of favorable results in the abstracts of publications, and poor reporting of side-effects).<ref>[http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/2/275#BIB87Methodological Issues in Current Antipsychotic Drug Trials (2008)].

===Typicals versus atypicals===
While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]] in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Geddes J, Freemantle N, Harrison P, Bebbington P |title=Atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: systematic overview and meta-regression analysis |journal=BMJ|volume=321 |issue=7273 |pages=1371–6 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11099280 |pmc=27538|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11099280 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7273.1371}}</ref> One review concluded there were no differences<ref name=Horacek2006/> while another<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Leucht S, Wahlbeck K, Hamann J, Kissling W |title=New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9369 |pages=1581–9 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12747876|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13306-5}}</ref> found that atypicals were "only moderately more efficacious".<ref name=Horacek2006/> These conclusions were, however, questioned by another review, which found that clozapine, amisulpride, and olanzapine and risperidone were more effective<ref name=Horacek2006/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Davis JM, Chen N, Glick ID |title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=553–64 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12796218 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.60.6.553}}</ref> [[Clozapine]] has appeared to be more effective than other atypical antipsychotics,<ref name=Horacek2006/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Tuunainen A, Wahlbeck K, Gilbody SM |title=Newer atypical antipsychotic medication versus clozapine for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD000966 |year=2000 |pmid=10796559|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000966|editor1-last=Tuunainen|editor1-first=Arja}}</ref> although it has previously been banned due to its potentially lethal side effects. While controlled clinical trials of atypicals reported that extrapyramidal symptoms occurred in 5–15% of patients, a study of bipolar disorder in a real world clinical setting found a rate of 63%, questioning the generalizability of the trials.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ghaemi SN, Hsu DJ, Rosenquist KJ, Pardo TB, Goodwin FK |title=Extrapyramidal side effects with atypical neuroleptics in bipolar disorder |journal=Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=209–13 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16412546|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2005.10.014}}</ref>

In 2005 the US government body [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lieberman JA |title=Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=353 |issue=12 |pages=1209–23 |year=2005 |month=September|pmid=16172203 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051688|author-separator=,|author2=Stroup TS|author3=McEvoy JP|display-authors=3|last4=Swartz|first4=Marvin S.|last5=Rosenheck|first5=Robert A.|last6=Perkins|first6=Diana O.|last7=Keefe|first7=Richard S.E.|last8=Davis|first8=Sonia M.|last9=Davis|first9=Clarence E.}}</ref> This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, [[perphenazine]], among 1493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only [[olanzapine]] outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging {{convert|44|lb}} over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean and maximal doses used for olanzapine were considerably higher than standard practice, and this has been postulated as a biasing factor that may explain olanzapine's superior efficacy over the other atypical antipsychotics studied, where doses were more in line with clinically relevant practices.<ref name="Bobo 2006">Meltzer and Bobo (2006) "Interpreting the Efficacy Findings in the CATIE Study: What Clinicians Should Know" CNS Spectr.11(7 Suppl 7):14-24</ref> No other atypical studied ([[risperidone]], [[quetiapine]], and [[ziprasidone]]) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis<ref name="pmid19058842">{{cite journal|last1=Leucht|first1=Stefan|last2=Corves|first2=Caroline|last3=Arbter|first3=Dieter|last4=Engel|first4=Rolf R|last5=Li|first5=Chunbo|last6=Davis|first6=John M|title=Second-generation versus first-generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia: a meta-analysis|journal=The Lancet|volume=373|issue=9657|pages=31–41|year=2009|month=January|pmid=19058842|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61764-X|url=http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/NLPs/2ndv1stGenNeurolepticsLancetLeucht2009.pdf}}</ref> by Dr. Leucht published in Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002).

A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Stroup T|title=Effectiveness of olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia following discontinuation of a previous atypical antipsychotic |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=611–22|year=2006 |pmid= 16585435 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.4.611 |last2=Lieberman |first2=JA |last3=McEvoy |first3=JP|last4=Swartz |first4=MS |last5=Davis |first5=SM |last6=Rosenheck |first6=RA |last7= Perkins |first7=DO |last8=Keefe|first8=RS |last9=Davis |first9=CE}}</ref> This phase consisted of a second randomization of the patients that discontinued taking medication in the first phase. Olanzapine was again the only medication to stand out in the outcome measures, although the results did not always reach statistical significance (which means they were not reliable findings) due in part to the decrease of power. The atypicals again did not produce fewer extrapyramidal effects than perphenazine. A subsequent phase was conducted<ref>{{Cite journal|author=McEvoy J |title=Effectiveness of clozapine versus olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia that did not respond to prior atypical antipsychotic treatment |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=600–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16585434|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.4.600 |last2=Lieberman |first2=JA |last3=Stroup |first3=TS |last4=Davis |first4=SM|last5=Meltzer |first5=HY |last6=Rosenheck |first6=RA |last7=Swartz |first7=MS |last8=Perkins |first8=DO |last9=Keefe|first9=RS}}</ref> that allowed clinicians to offer [[clozapine]] which was more effective at reducing medication drop-outs than other neuroleptic agents. However, the potential for clozapine to cause toxic side effects, including agranulocytosis, limits its usefulness.

It had been hoped that patient adherence to antipsychotics would be higher with the atypicals, but a 2008 review found that the data have failed to substantiate the notion that novel antipsychotic drug use leads to improved medication compliance and favorable clinical outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Voruganti LP, Baker LK, Awad AG |title=New generation antipsychotic drugs and compliance behaviour |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=21 |issue=2|pages=133–9 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18332660 |doi= 10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f52851}}</ref>

Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.<ref>[http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/1/17 How CATIE brought us back to Kansas: a critical re-evaluation of the concept of atypical antipsychotics and their place in the treatment of schizophrenia (2008)].

==Adverse effects==
Antipsychotics are associated with a range of side effects. It is well-recognized that many people stop taking them (around two-thirds even in controlled drug trials) due in part to adverse effects.<ref name="Bellack06">{{Cite journal|author=Bellack AS |title=Scientific and Consumer Models of Recovery in Schizophrenia: Concordance, Contrasts, and Implications |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=432–42 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16461575 |pmc=2632241 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044}}</ref> Potential adverse effects include [[Extrapyramidal side effect|extrapyramidal]] reactions (such as acute [[dystonia]]s, [[akathisia]], and [[parkinsonism|Parkinsonian]] symptoms such as rigidity and [[tremor]]), [[tardive dyskinesia]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypotension]], [[impotence]], lethargy, [[seizure]]s, intense dreams or nightmares, and [[hyperprolactinaemia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mangrella M |title=[Intensive hospital monitoring of adverse reactions to benzodiazepines and neuroleptic agents] |language=Italian |journal=Minerva Medica |volume=89 |issue=7–8 |pages=293–300 |year=1998 |pmid= 9824992|author-separator=,|author2=Motola G|author3=Russo F|display-authors=3|last4=Mazzeo|first4=F|last5=Falcone|first5=G|last6=d'Alessio|first6=O|last7=Piucci|first7=B|last8=Rossi|first8=F}}</ref> Side effects from antipsychotics can in some cases be managed by the use of other medications.

* Clozapine also has a risk of inducing agranulocytosis, a potentially dangerous reduction in the number of white blood cells in the body. Because of this risk, patients prescribed clozapine require regular blood tests to catch the condition early if it does occur and prevent harm to the patient.<ref name="GoodmanGilman">{{Cite book|last=Baldessarini |first=Ross J. |coauthors=Frank I.

* One of the more serious potential side effects is [[tardive dyskinesia]], in which the sufferer may show repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements (that are permanent and have no cure) often of the lips, face, legs, or torso. [[Tardive dyskinesia]] tends to appear only with long-term use of antipsychotics, and is more likely to occur with the use of typical antipsychotics.<ref name="Stahl" />
* A potentially serious side effect of some antipsychotics is the tendency to lower an individual's seizure threshold. Chlorpromazine and clozapine, in particular, have a relatively high seizurogenic potential. Fluphenazine, haloperidol, pimozide and risperidone exhibit a relatively low risk. Caution should be exercised in individuals that have a history of seizurogenic conditions such as [[epilepsy]], or [[brain damage]].
* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], in which the drugs appear to cause the temperature regulation centers to fail, resulting in a medical emergency, as the patient's temperature suddenly increases to dangerous levels.
* [[Dysphoria]].
* Drug-induced parkinsonism due to [[dopamine D2 receptor]] blockade may mimic [[idiopathic]] parkinsonism. The typical antipsychotics are more prone to cause this than the atypical antipsychotics.
* [[Sexual dysfunction]], which may rarely continue after withdrawal, similar to [[Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction]].
* [[Akathisia]], inability to sit still or remain motionless. Both typicals and atypicals can lead to akathisia.<ref>{{Cite journal

Side effects can vary significantly from individual to individual, and there is no way to predict whether a given individual will or will not experience side effects to a given antipsychotic.

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal symptoms from antipsychotics may emerge during dosage reduction and discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can include [[nausea]], [[emesis]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhea]], [[rhinorrhea]], [[diaphoresis]], [[myalgia]], [[paresthesia]], [[anxiety]], agitation, restlessness, and [[insomnia]]. The psychological withdrawal symptoms can include psychosis, and can be mistaken for a relapse of the underlying disorder. Conversely, the withdrawal syndrome may also be a trigger for relapse. Better management of the withdrawal syndrome may improve the ability of individuals to discontinue antipsychotics.<ref name="Dilsaver-1988">{{Cite journal| last1 = Dilsaver | first1 = SC. | last2 = Alessi | first2 = NE. | title = Antipsychotic withdrawal symptoms: phenomenology and pathophysiology | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–6 | month = Mar | year = 1988 | doi =  10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05116.x| pmid = 2899377 }}</ref><ref name="Moncrieff-2006">{{Cite journal| last1 = Moncrieff | first1 = J. | title = Why is it so difficult to stop psychiatric drug treatment?

Withdrawal effects may also occur when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (presumably due to variations of potency and receptor activity). Such withdrawal effects can include [[cholinergic]] rebound, an activation syndrome, and motor syndromes including [[dyskinesias]].

===Structural effects===
Many studies now indicate that chronic treatment with antipsychotics affects the brain at a structural level, for example increasing the volume of the [[basal ganglia]] (especially the [[caudate nucleus]]), and reducing cortical [[grey matter]] volume in different brain areas. The effects may differ for typical versus atypical antipsychotics and may interact with different stages of disorders.<ref name=Vita2007>{{Cite journal|author=Vita A, De Peri L |title=The effects of antipsychotic treatment on cerebral structure and function in schizophrenia |journal=International Review of Psychiatry |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=429–36 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17671875 |doi=10.1080/09540260701486332}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Beng-Choon Ho, MRCPsych; Nancy C.

* [[Amisulpride]] (Solian) - Selective dopamine antagonist. Higher doses (greater than 400&nbsp;mg) act upon post-synaptic dopamine receptors resulting in a reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as psychosis. Lower doses, however, act upon dopamine autoreceptors, resulting in increased dopamine transmission, improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower doses of amisulpride have also been shown to have [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects in non-schizophrenic patients, leading to its use in [[dysthymia]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobias]]. Amisulpride has not been approved for use by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] in the United States.
* [[Asenapine]] (Saphris) is a 5-HT2A- and D2-receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.
* [[Paliperidone]] (Invega) - Derivative of risperidone that was approved in 2006, it offers a [[OROS|controlled release]] once-daily dose, or a once-monthly [[depot injection]].
* [[Iloperidone]] (Fanapt, Fanapta, and previously known as Zomaril) - Approved by the FDA in 2009, it is fairly well tolerated, although [[hypotension]], [[dizziness]], and [[somnolence]] were very common side effects.
* [[Zotepine]] (Nipolept, Losizopilon, Lodopin, Setous)- An atypical antipsychotic indicated for acute and chronic schizophrenia. It was approved in Japan circa 1982 and Germany in 1990.
* [[Sertindole]] (Serdolect, and Serlect in Mexico). Sertindole was developed by the Danish pharmaceutical company [[H. Lundbeck]]. Like the other atypical antipsychotics, it is believed to have [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] activity at dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.

==Mechanism of action==
All antipsychotic drugs tend to block [[dopamine receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptors]] in the [[dopamine]] pathways of the [[Human brain|brain]]. This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] has been linked to psychotic experiences. It is the blockade of dopamine receptors in this pathway that is thought{{By whom|date=October 2012}} to control psychotic experiences. It has also been proven{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} less dopamine released in the prefrontal cortex in the brain, and excess dopamine released from all other pathways, has also been linked to psychotic expieriences, caused by abnormal dopaminergic function as a result of patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Various neuroleptics such as [[haloperidol]] and [[chlorpromazine]] suppress dopamine chemicals throughout its pathways, in order for dopamine receptors to function normally.

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block dopamine receptors in the [[mesocortical pathway]], [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]], and the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. Blocking D<sub>2</sub> receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some of the unwanted [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]], in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[thioridazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side effects.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have a similar blocking effect on D<sub>2</sub> receptors. Some also block or partially block [[serotonin]] receptors (particularly 5HT<sub>2A, C</sub> and 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors):ranging from risperidone, which acts overwhelmingly on serotonin receptors, to amisulpride, which has no serotonergic activity. The additional effects on serotonin receptors may be why some of them can benefit the "negative symptoms" of schizophrenia.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Murphy BP, Chung YC, Park TW, McGorry PD |title= Pharmacological treatment of primary negative symptoms in schizophrenia: a systematic review |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=88 |issue=1–3 |pages=5–25 |year=2006 |month= December |pmid=16930948 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2006.07.002}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Thorazine advert.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Thorazine ([[chlorpromazine]]) from the 1950s, reflecting the perceptions of psychosis, including the now-discredited perception of a tendency towards violence, from the time when antipsychotics were discovered<ref>The text reads: ''When the patient lashes out against "them" - THORAZINE (brand of chlorpromazine) quickly puts an end to his violent outburst. 'Thorazine' is especially effective when the psychotic episode is triggered by delusions or hallucinations. At the outset of treatment, Thorazine's combination of antipsychotic and sedative effects provides both emotional and physical calming. Assaultive or destructive behavior is rapidly controlled. As therapy continues, the initial sedative effect gradually disappears. But the antipsychotic effect continues, helping to dispel or modify delusions, hallucinations and confusion, while keeping the patient calm and approachable. SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH LABORATORIES leaders in psychopharmaceutical research.''</ref>]]

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, [[chlorpromazine]], was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]]. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a non-permanent "pharmacological [[lobotomy]]".<ref name=pieters>{{Cite journal|last=Pieters|first=Toine|coauthors=Majerus, Benoît|title=The introduction of chlorpromazine in Belgium and the Netherlands (1951–1968); tango between old and new treatment features|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|date=1 December 2011|volume=42|issue=4|pages=443–452|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2011.05.003}}</ref> Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than lobotomy, even though it was known to be capable of causing severe sedation. The underlying [[neurochemistry]] involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.

The discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to greatly reduced use of restraint, seclusion, and sedation in the management of agitated patients,<ref name=pieters /> and also led to further research that resulted in the development of [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, [[Henri Laborit]] described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.<ref>Healy, D. 2005.

Thus, the word means ''taking hold of one's nerves''. This may refer to common side effects such as reduced activity in general, as well as lethargy and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and in some cases harmful, they were at one time, along with akathisia, considered a reliable sign that the drug was working.<ref name=pieters /> The term "ataraxy" was coined by the neurologist Howard Fabing and the classicist Alister Cameron to describe the observed effect of psychic indifference and detachment in patients treated with chlorpromazine.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-63353-6| last = Owens| first = David Griffith Cunningham| title = A guide to the extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic drugs| date = 1999-04-13|url = http://books.google.ie/books?id=RwRSahg71GkC&pg=PA12| page = 12}}</ref> This term derived from the Greek adjective "[[wikt:ἀτάρακτος|ἀτάρακτος]]" (''[[wikt:ataractic|ataraktos]]'') which means "not disturbed, not excited, without confusion, steady, calm".<ref name="king"/> In the use of the terms "[[tranquilizer]]" and "ataractic", medical practitioners distinguished between the "major tranquilizers" or "major ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat psychoses, and the "minor tranquilizers" or "minor ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat [[neurosis|neuroses]].<ref name="king"/> While popular during the 1950s, these terms are infrequently used today. They are being abandoned in favor of "antipsychotic", which refers to the drug's desired effects.<ref name="king"/> Today, "minor tranquilizer" can refer to [[anxiolytic]] and/or [[hypnotic]] drugs such as the [[benzodiazepines]] and [[nonbenzodiazepines]] which have some antipsychotic properties and are recommended for concurrent use with antipsychotics, and are useful for insomnia or drug-induced psychosis.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Saunders| isbn = 0-7216-5257-3 last = Tasman| first = Allan| title = Psychiatry Volume 2| page = 956}}</ref> They are powerful (and potentially addictive) sedatives.

Antipsychotics are broadly divided into two groups, the [[typical antipsychotic|typical or first-generation antipsychotics]] and the [[atypical antipsychotic|atypical or second-generation antipsychotics]]. The typical antipsychotics are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical antipsychotics are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see [[dopamine antagonist]] and [[serotonin antagonist]]), multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and [[dopamine partial agonists]], which are often categorized as atypicals.<ref name=Horacek2006>{{Cite journal|author=Horacek J |title=Mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the neurobiology of schizophrenia|journal=CNS Drugs |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=389–409 |year=2006 |pmid=16696579|doi=10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004|author-separator=,|author2=Bubenikova-Valesova V|author3=Kopecek M|display-authors=3|last4=Palenicek|first4=Tomas|last5=Dockery|first5=Colleen|last6=Mohr|first6=Pavel|last7=h??Schl|first7=Cyril}}</ref>

==Controversy==
According to [[The Guardian]] newspaper: "At the heart of years of dissent against psychiatry through the ages has been its use of drugs, particularly antipsychotics, to treat distress. Do such drugs actually target any "psychiatric condition"? Or are they chemical control—a socially-useful reduction of the paranoid, deluded, distressed, bizarre and odd into semi-vegetative zombies?"<ref name="guard 1" />

Use of this class of drugs has a history of criticism in residential care. As the drugs used can make patients calmer and more compliant, critics claim that the drugs can be overused. Outside doctors can feel under pressure from care home staff.<ref>''GPs under 'pressure' to issue neuroleptics, claims professor'', Chemist + Druggist, 15 January 2009</ref> In an official review commissioned by UK government ministers it was reported that the needless use of anti-psychotic medication in dementia care was widespread and was linked to 1800 deaths per year.<ref>Triggle, Nick.

There has also been controversy about the role of [[pharmaceutical]] companies in [[marketing]] and promoting antipsychotics, including allegations of downplaying or covering up adverse effects, expanding the number of conditions or illegally promoting off-label usage; influencing drug trials (or their publication) to try to show that the expensive and profitable newer atypicals were superior to the older cheaper typicals that were out of patent. Following charges of illegal marketing, settlements by two large pharmaceutical companies in the US set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations.<ref name=bied2010/> One case involved [[Eli Lilly and Company]]'s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]].

Harvard medical professor [[Joseph Biederman]] conducted research on bipolar disorder in children that led to an increase in such diagnoses. A 2008 Senate investigation found that Biederman also received $1.6 million in speaking and consulting fees between 2000 and 2007&nbsp;— some of them undisclosed to Harvard&nbsp;— from companies including makers of antipsychotic drugs prescribed for children with bipolar disorder. [[Johnson & Johnson]] gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, where research was conducted, in part, on [[Risperdal]], the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment.<ref name=bied2010/>

Pharmaceutical companies have also been accused of attempting to set the mental heath agenda through activities such as funding consumer advocacy groups.<ref>{{cite web| author= Gosden R; Beader S |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/pharm-agenda.html |title=Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies | year=2001}}</ref>
