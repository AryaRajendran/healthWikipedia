'''Tympanosclerosis''' (also known as '''myringosclerosis''' or '''intratympanic tympanosclerosis''') is a condition caused by [[calcification]] of tissues in the middle ear, sometimes resulting in a detrimental effect to hearing.<ref name="forseni">{{cite journal | author = Forséni M, Bagger-Sjöbäck D, Hultcrantz M | title = A study of inflammatory mediators in the human tympanosclerotic middle ear | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology--Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 127 | issue = 5 | pages = 559–64 | year = 2001 | month = May | pmid = 11346433 | doi = | url = http://archotol.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11346433 | issn = | accessdate = 2010-01-26}}</ref><ref name="asiri">{{cite journal | author = Asiri S, Hasham A, al Anazy F, Zakzouk S, Banjar A | title = Tympanosclerosis: review of literature and incidence among patients with middle-ear infection | journal = The Journal of Laryngology and Otology | volume = 113 | issue = 12 | pages = 1076–80 | year = 1999 | month = December | pmid = 10767919 | doi = | url = | issn =}}</ref>

==Classification==
''Myringosclerosis'' refers to a calcification only within the [[tympanic membrane]] and is usually less extensive than ''intratympanic tympanosclerosis'', which refers to any other location within the middle ear such as the [[ossicular chain]], middle ear [[mucosa]] or, less frequently, the [[mastoid cavity]].<ref name="isaacson">{{cite journal | author = Isaacson JE, Vora NM | title = Differential diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 1125–32 | year = 2003 | month = September | pmid = 14524400 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref>
==Signs and symptoms==
Few symptoms present as a result of tympanosclerosis. Myringosclerosis rarely results with any symptoms.<ref name="isaacson"/> Tympanosclerosis, on the other hand, can result with significant [[hearing loss]]<ref name="isaacson"/> or chalky, white patches on the middle ear or temporal membrane.<ref name="forseni"/>

==Causes==
The aetiology for tympanosclerosis is not extensively understood. There are several probable factors which could result in the condition appearing, including:
*Long term [[otitis media]] (or 'glue ear')<ref name="asiri"/>
*Insertion of a [[tympanostomy tube]].<ref name="kay">{{cite journal | author = Kay DJ, Nelson M, Rosenfeld RM | title = Meta-analysis of tympanostomy tube sequelae | journal = Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery : Official Journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 374–80 | year = 2001 | month = April | pmid = 11283489 | doi = 10.1067/mhn.2001.113941| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0194599801508633 | issn = | accessdate = 2010-01-26}}</ref><ref name="johnston">{{cite journal | author = Johnston LC | title = Tympanic membrane abnormalities and hearing levels at the ages of 5 and 6 years in relation to persistent otitis media and tympanostomy tube insertion in the first 3 years of life: a prospective study incorporating a randomized clinical trial | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = e58–67 | year = 2004 | month = July | pmid = 15231974 | doi = 10.1542/peds.114.1.e58| url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15231974 | issn = | accessdate = 2010-01-26 | author-separator = , | author2 = Feldman HM | author3 = Paradise JL | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Bernard | first4 = BS | last5 = Colborn | first5 = DK | last6 = Casselbrant | first6 = ML | last7 = Janosky | first7 = JE}}</ref><ref name="lous">{{cite journal | author = Lous J, Burton MJ, Felding JU, Ovesen T, Rovers MM, Williamson I | title = Grommets (ventilation tubes) for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Online) | volume = | issue = 1 | pages = CD001801 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15674886 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001801.pub2 | issn =  | editor1-last = Lous | editor1-first = Jørgen}}</ref> If aspiration is performed as part of the insertion, the risk of tympanosclerosis occurring increases.<ref name="mcrae">{{cite journal | author = McRae D, Gatland DJ, Youngs R, Cook J | title = Aspiration of middle ear effusions prior to grommet insertion an etiological factor in tympanosclerosis | journal = The Journal of Otolaryngology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–31 | year = 1989 | month = August | pmid = 2769837 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> Risk also increases if a larger tube is used,<ref name="hampal">{{cite journal | author = Hampal S, Flood LM, Kumar BU | title = The mini-grommet and tympanosclerosis | journal = The Journal of Laryngology and Otology | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–4 | year = 1991 | month = March | pmid = 2019798 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> or if the procedure is repeated.<ref name="maw">{{cite journal | author = Maw AR | title = Development of tympanosclerosis in children with otitis media with effusion and ventilation tubes | journal = The Journal of Laryngology and Otology | volume = 105 | issue = 8 | pages = 614–7 | year = 1991 | month = August | pmid = 1919311 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref>

*There is ongoing research as to whether or not [[cholesteatoma]] is associated with tympanosclerosis. If there is an association, it is likely that the two conditions co-exist together.<ref name="asiri"/>

==Pathophysiology==
Increased [[fibroblast]] activity results in deposition of [[collagen]]. [[Calcium phosphate]] [[plaque]]s{{Disambiguation needed|date=January 2012}} then form in the [[lamina propria]] of the tympanic membrane.<ref name="forseni"/><ref name="asiri"/>

==Diagnosis==
If lesions are typical, non-extensive and with no detriment to hearing, investigation into the condition is rarely required. Audiometry is used to determine the extent of hearing loss, if any.<ref name="isaacson"/> Tympanometry produces tympanograms which can be different when tympanosclerosis is present.<ref name="onusko">{{cite journal | author = Onusko E | title = Tympanometry | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 70 | issue = 9 | pages = 1713–20 | year = 2004 | month = November | pmid = 15554489 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> [[Computerised tomography]] (CT) can be used to determine if disease is present in the middle ear.<ref name="swartz">{{cite journal | author = Swartz JD, Goodman RS, Russell KB, Marlowe FI, Wolfson RJ | title = High-resolution computed tomography of the middle ear and mastoid.

Cholesteatoma is similar in appearance but the whiteness is behind the tympanic membrane, rather than inside.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Treatment==
Hearing aids are a common treatment for hearing loss disorders. A more specific treatment is surgical, involving excision of the sclerotic areas and then further repair of the ossicular chain. There are several techniques, sometimes involving two surgeries;<ref name="asiri"/><ref name="bayazit">{{cite journal | author = Bayazit YA, Ozer E, Kara C, Gökpinar S, Kanlikama M, Mumbuç S | title = An analysis of the single-stage tympanoplasty with over-underlay grafting in tympanosclerosis | journal = Otology & Neurotology : Official Publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–4 | year = 2004 | month = May | pmid = 15129093 | doi = 10.1097/00129492-200405000-00001| url = http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1531-7129&volume=25&issue=3&spage=211 | issn = | accessdate = 2010-01-26}}</ref> success rates are, however, variable.<ref name="vincent">{{cite journal | author = Vincent R, Oates J, Sperling NM | title = Stapedotomy for tympanosclerotic stapes fixation: is it safe and efficient?

==Epidemiology==
Myringosclerosis seems to be more common than tympanosclerosis.<ref name="asiri"/> Most research has not been conducted upon the general, healthy population, but rather those with otitis media or patients who have had tympanostomy tubes in prior procedures. Of the children studied who had 'glue ear', and who were treated with tympanostomy tubing, 23-40% of cases had tympanosclerosis.<ref name="kay"/><ref name="maw"/><ref name="pereira">{{cite journal | author = Pereira MB, Pereira DR, Costa SS | title = Tympanostomy tube sequelae in children with otitis media with effusion: a three-year follow-up study | journal = Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 415–20 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16446953  | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-72992005000400003&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en | issn = | accessdate = 2010-01-26 | doi = 10.1590/S0034-72992005000400003}}</ref><ref name="schilder">{{cite journal | author = Schilder AG, Zielhuis GA, Haggard MP, van den Broek P | title = Long-term effects of otitis media with effusion: otomicroscopic findings | journal = The American Journal of Otology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 365–72 | year = 1995 | month = May | pmid = 8588632 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> One study suggested that people with [[atherosclerosis]] were more likely to have tympanosclerosis than otherwise healthy individuals.<ref name="ferri"/>
