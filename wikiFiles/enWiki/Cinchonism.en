'''Cinchonism''' or '''quinism''' is a [[pathology|pathological]] condition in humans caused by an overdose of [[quinine]] or its natural source, [[cinchona]] bark.  Quinine is medically used to treat [[malaria]].  In much smaller amounts, quinine is an ingredient of [[Tonic water|tonic]] drinks, acting as a [[bittering agent]].  Cinchonism can occur from therapeutic doses of quinine, either from one or several large doses. [[Quinidine]] (Class 1A [[antiarrhythmic agent|anti-arrhythmic]]) can also cause cinchonism symptoms to develop with as little as a single dose.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s of mild cinchonism (which may occur from standard therapeutic doses of quinine) include [[flushed]] and sweaty skin, ringing of the ears ([[tinnitus]]), blurred vision, impaired hearing, confusion, reversible high-frequency hearing loss, headache, abdominal pain, rashes, [[drug-induced lichenoid reaction]] ([[Lichen planus|lichenoid]] [[photosensitivity]]),<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Dawson, T.

Large doses of quinine may lead to severe symptoms of cinchonism: skin rashes, deafness (reversible), [[somnolence]], diminished visual acuity or blindness, [[anaphylactic shock]], and disturbances in [[cardiac arrhythmia|cardiac rhythm]] or conduction, death from cardiotoxicity. Quinine may also trigger a rare form of hypersensitivity reaction in malaria patients termed [[blackwater fever]] that results in massive [[hemolysis]], [[hemoglobinemia]], [[hemoglobinuria]], and [[renal failure]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Patients treated with quinine may also suffer from [[hypoglycemia]] (especially if administered [[intravenous]]ly) and [[hypotension]] (low [[blood pressure]]).

Most symptoms of cinchonism (except in severe cases) are reversible and disappear once quinine is withdrawn.

Quinine, like chloroquine, inactivates enzymes in the [[lysosomes]] of cells, and has an anti-inflammatory effect, hence its use in [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. However switching off these enzymes can also cause abnormal accumulation of glycogen and phospholipids in lysosomes, causing a toxic [[myopathy]]. It is possible this is the root cause of cinchonism.
