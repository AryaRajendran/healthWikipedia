The '''American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists''' ('''AAPLOG''') was originally put together in 1957 by a group of [[gynecology|gynecologists]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] led by Dr. William Hartherford. Hartherford created the organization to support the [[pro-life]] cause and to raise public awareness about the subject.

After Hartherford's death, an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]], Benjamin B. Travelli, overtook leadership of the organization. He resigned from the position in 1999 and was followed by the present leader Dennis P. Dunne.

AAPLOG is the one of the largest special interest groups recognized by the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), claiming over "2,500 members and associates",<ref>http://www.aaplog.org</ref> approximately 5% of ACOG's total membership.<ref>[http://www.acog.org/from_home/ACOGFactSheet.pdf ACOG Fact Sheet] (PDF)</ref>
