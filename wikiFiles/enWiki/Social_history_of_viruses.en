The '''social history of viruses''' describes the  influence of viruses and viral infections on human history. Viruses are the most abundant biological entity on Earth and they have infected plants and animals, including humans, for millions of years. [[Epidemic]]s caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the [[Neolithic period]]. Previously [[hunter-gatherer]]s, humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities, which allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]].

Despite having no idea that viruses existed, [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Edward Jenner]] were the first to develop [[vaccine]]s to protect against viral infections. The sizes and shapes of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the [[electron microscope]] in the 1930s, when the science of [[virology]] gained momentum.

In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They have driven evolution by [[horizontal gene transfer|transferring genes]] across species, play important roles in [[ecosystem]]s, and are essential to life.

Contemporary humans lived in small communities, and those who succumbed to infection either died or developed immunity. This [[adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] is only passed down to offspring temporarily, by [[antibody|antibodies]] in  breast milk and other antibodies that cross the [[placenta]] from the mother's blood to the unborn child's. Therefore, sporadic outbreaks probably occurred in each generation. In about 9000&nbsp;BC, when many people began to settle on the fertile flood plains of the [[River Nile]], the population became dense enough for the virus to maintain a constant presence due to the high concentration of susceptible people.<ref name="Tucker, p. 6">Tucker, p. 6</ref> Other epidemics of viral diseases, such as [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[polio]], which depend on large concentrations of people, also first occurred at this time.<ref>Clark, p. 20</ref>

A quarter of the Athenian army died from the infection along with many of the city's civilians.<ref>Zimmer, p. 82</ref>

[[Measles]] is an old disease, but it was not until the 10th century that the Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (865–925) (known as "Rhazes") first identified it.<ref name="Levins, pp. 297–298">Levins, pp. 297–298</ref> Rhazes used the Arabic name "hasbah" for measles, but it has had many other names including "rubeola" from the Latin word rubeus, which means red, and "morbilli", which means "small plague".<ref>Dobson, pp. 140–141</ref>

The close similarities between measles virus, [[canine distemper|canine distemper virus]], and [[rinderpest]] virus have given rise to speculation that measles was first transmitted to humans from domesticated dogs or cattle.<ref name="Karlen, p.57">Karlen, p. 57</ref> The measles virus appears to have fully diverged from the then-widespread rinderpest virus by the 12th century.<ref name="Furuse2010">{{cite journal |author=Furuse Y, Suzuki A, Oshitani H |title=Origin of measles virus: divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries |journal=Virol.

A measles infection confers lifelong immunity.

One of the earliest descriptions of a virus-infected plant can be found in a poem written by the Japanese [[Empress Kōken]] (718–770), in which she describes a plant in summer with yellowing leaves. The plant, later identified as ''[[Eupatorium lindleyanum]]'', is often infected with [[tomato yellow leaf curl virus]].<ref>Mahy, (a) p.  10</ref>

The rapidly growing population of Europe and the rising concentrations of people in its towns and cities became a fertile ground for many infectious and contagious diseases, of which the [[Black Death]]&nbsp;– a bacterial infection&nbsp;– is probably the most notorious.<ref name="pmid11632234">{{cite journal |author=Gottfried RS |title=Population, plague, and the sweating sickness: demographic movements in late fifteenth-century England |journal=The Journal of British Studies |volume=17 |issue= |pages=12–37 |year=1977 |pmid=11632234 |doi= 10.1086/385710|url=}}</ref> Except for smallpox and influenza, documented outbreaks of infections now known to be caused by viruses were rare.

Measles was endemic throughout the highly populated countries of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.<ref>Gilchrist, p. 41</ref> In England the disease, then called "mezils", was first described in the 13th century, and was probably one of the 49&nbsp;plagues that occurred between 526 and 1087.<ref name="pmid20459960"/>

Later invasions of Mongols, led by [[Genghis Khan]] and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent.<ref name="Barrett 87">Barrett, p. 87</ref> At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%.

In 1546 [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (1478–1553) wrote a classic description of measles. He thought the disease was caused by "seeds" (''seminaria'') that were spread from person to person.

Many paintings can be found in the museums of Europe depicting [[tulips]] with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the [[still life]] studies of [[Johannes Bosschaert]], were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this [[tulip mania]] in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house.<ref>Crawford (2011), pp. 121–122</ref> It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a [[Tulip breaking virus|virus]] accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from [[jasmine]].<ref>Mahy, (a) pp. 10–11</ref> Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment.

Until the Irish [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845–1852, the commonest cause of disease in potatoes was not the [[Phytophthora infestans|mould]] that causes blight but a virus. The disease, called "curl", is caused by [[potato leafroll virus]], and it was widespread in England in the 1770s, where it destroyed 75% of the potato crop. At that time, the Irish potato crop remained relatively unscathed.<ref>{{cite book |author=Zuckerman, Larry |title=The potato: how the humble spud rescued the western world |publisher=North Point Press |location=San Francisco |year=1999 |page=21 |isbn=0-86547-578-4}}</ref>

Lady [[Mary Wortley Montagu]] (1689–1762) was an aristocrat, a writer and the wife of a [[Member of Parliament]]. In 1716, her husband, Edward Wortley Montagu was appointed British Ambassador in Istanbul. She followed him there and two weeks after her arrival discovered the local practice of protection against smallpox by [[variolation]]&nbsp;– the injection of pus from smallpox victims into the skin.<ref name="Tucker, p. 6"/> Her younger brother had died of smallpox, and she too had had the disease. Determined to spare her five-year-old son Edward from similar suffering, she ordered the embassy surgeon, Charles Maitland to variolate him. On her return to London, she asked Maitland to variolate her four-year-old daughter in the presence of the king's physicians.<ref>Tucker, pp. 16–17</ref> Later, Montagu persuaded the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince and Princess of Wales]] to sponsor a public demonstration of the procedure. Six prisoners who had been condemned to death and were awaiting execution at Newgate Prison were offered a full pardon for serving as the subjects of the public experiment. They accepted, and in 1721 were variolated. All the prisoners recovered from the procedure;  to test its protective effect one of them, a nineteen-year-old woman, was ordered to sleep in the same bed as a ten-year-old smallpox victim for six weeks. She did not contract the disease.<ref>Tucker, p. 17</ref>

The experiment was repeated on eleven orphan children, all of whom survived the ordeal, and by 1722  even [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]'s grandchildren had been inoculated.<ref>Lane, p. 137</ref> But the practice was not entirely safe and caused many deaths. The procedure was expensive; some medical practitioners charged between £5 and £10 and some sold the method to other practitioners for fees between £50 to £100, or for half of the profits. Variolation became a lucrative franchise but it remained beyond the means of many until the late 1770s.<ref>Lane, pp. 138–139</ref> At the time nothing was known about viruses or the [[immune system]], and no one knew how the procedure afforded protection.<ref>Zimmer, p. 83</ref>
[[File:Jenner cartoon from 1802.jpg|left|thumb|A cartoon from 1802 depicting Jenner vaccinating&nbsp;– the recipients are shown with cows emerging from their bodies.]]

[[Edward Jenner]] (1749–1823), a British rural physician, was variolated as a boy. He had suffered greatly from the ordeal but survived fully protected from smallpox. Jenner knew of a local belief that dairy workers who had contracted a relatively mild infection called [[cowpox]] were immune to smallpox. He decided to test the "theory" (though he was probably not the first to do so). On 14&nbsp;May 1796 he selected "a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox".<ref>Reid, p. 18</ref> The boy,  [[James Phipps]] (1788–1853),  survived the experimental inoculation with cowpox virus and suffered only a mild fever. On 1&nbsp;July 1796, Jenner took some "smallpox matter" (probably infected pus) and repeatedly inoculated Phipps's arms with it. Phipps survived, and was subsequently inoculated with smallpox more than 20&nbsp;times without succumbing to the disease. Vaccination&nbsp;– the word is derived from the Latin ''vacca'' meaning "cow"&nbsp;– had been invented.<ref>Reid, p. 19</ref> Jenner's method was soon shown to be safer than variolation and by 1801 more than 100,000 people had been vaccinated.

Despite objections from those medical practitioners  who still practised variolation, and who foresaw a decline in their income, free vaccination of the poor was introduced in the UK in 1840. Because of associated deaths, variolation was declared illegal in the same year.<ref>Lane, p. 140</ref> Vaccination was made compulsory in England and Wales by the 1853 [[Vaccination Act]] and parents could be fined £1 if their children were not vaccinated before they were three months of age. But the law was not adequately enforced, and the system for providing vaccinations,  unchanged since 1840, was ineffective. After an early compliance by the population only a small proportion were vaccinated.<ref name="isbn1-58046-036-4">{{cite book |author=Deborah Brunton |title=The politics of vaccination: practice and policy in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, 1800–1874 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y., USA |year=2008 |pages=39–45 |isbn=1-58046-036-4}}</ref> Compulsory vaccination was not well received and, following  protests, the Anti Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League were formed in 1866.<ref>Glynn and Glynn, p. 153</ref><ref>Brunton, p. 91</ref> The antivaccination Following the anti-vaccination campaigns there was a severe outbreak of smallpox in Gloucester in 1895, the city's first  in twenty years; 434 people died, including 281 children.<ref>Glynn and Glynn, p. 161</ref> Despite this, the British government conceded to the protesters and the Vaccination Act of 1898 abolished fines and made provision for a "conscientious objector" clause&nbsp;– the first use of the term&nbsp;– for parents who did not believe in vaccination.

===Louis Pasteur and rabies===
[[File:Louis Pasteur, foto av Félix Nadar.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Louis Pasteur]]
Rabies is an often fatal disease caused by the infection of mammals with [[rabies virus]]. Today it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as  foxes and bats, but it is one of the oldest known virus diseases: ''rabies'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word (''rabhas'') that dates from 3000 BC,<ref name="Shors, p. 352"/>  which means "madness" or "rage"<ref name="isbn0-471-90341-8">{{cite book |author=Zuckerman, Arie J. |title=Principles and practice of clinical virology |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1987 |page=459 |isbn=0-471-90341-8}}</ref> and the disease has been known for over 4000&nbsp;years.<ref name="Mahy 243"/> Descriptions of rabies can be found in  [[Mesopotamia]]n texts,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Rabies and Rabid Dogs in Sumerian and Akkadian Literature | author=Yuhong, Wu | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | year=2001 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=32–43 | jstor=606727 | doi=10.2307/606727}}</ref> and the ancient Greeks called it "lyssa" or "lytta"  meaning madness.<ref name="Mahy 243"/>  References to rabies can be found in the [[Laws of Eshnunna]], which date from 2300&nbsp;BC. [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) wrote one of the earliest undisputed descriptions of the disease and how it was passed to humans. [[Celsus]], in the first century AD, first recorded the symptom called hydrophobia and suggested that the saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison&nbsp;– to describe this he used the word "virus".<ref name="Mahy 243"/> Rabies does not cause epidemics, but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms, which include insanity, [[wikt:hydrophobia|hydrophobia]], and death.<ref name="Mahy 243"/>

In France during the time of Louis Pasteur ( 1822–1895) there were only a few hundred rabies infections in humans each year, but cures were desperately sought. Aware of the possible danger, Pasteur  began to look for the "microbe" in mad dogs.<ref>Reid, pp. 93–94</ref>  Pasteur showed that when the dried spinal cords from dogs that had died from rabies were crushed and injected into healthy dogs they did not become infected. He repeated the experiment several times on the same dog with tissue that had been dried for fewer and fewer days, until the dog survived even after injections of fresh rabies-infected spinal tissue. Pasteur had immunised the dog against rabies as he later did with 50 more.<ref>Reid, p. 96</ref>
[[File:Rabies cartoon circa 1826.jpg|left|thumb|A cartoon from 1826 depicting a rabid dog on a London street]]

Although he had little idea how his method worked, he went on to test it on a boy. [[Joseph Meister]] (1876–1940) was brought to Pasteur by his mother on 6&nbsp;July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. A bricklayer had defended the boy from the dog with an iron bar, but only after the salivating dog had bitten the boy 14&nbsp;times. Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he was well aware of the consequences for him if things were to go wrong. Pasteur decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal cord over the following 10&nbsp;days.<ref>Reid, pp. 97–98</ref> Later Pasteur wrote, "as the death of this child appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease&nbsp;... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs".<ref>Dobson, p. 159</ref>  Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27&nbsp;July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog.<ref>Dobson, pp. 159–160</ref> Pasteur's method of treatment  remained in use for over 50&nbsp;years.<ref name="pmid9218283">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(96)00314-3 |author=Dreesen DW |title=A global review of rabies vaccines for human use |journal=Vaccine |volume=15 |pages=S2–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9218283}}</ref>

Little was known about the cause of the disease until 1903 when [[Adelchi Negri]] (1876–1912) first saw microscopic lesions&nbsp;– now called [[Negri bodies]]&nbsp;– in the brains of rabid animals.<ref name="pmid8804019">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.1996.tb00893.x |author=Kristensson K, Dastur DK, Manghani DK, Tsiang H, Bentivoglio M |title=Rabies: interactions between neurons and viruses.

[[Paul Remlinger]] (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150&nbsp;[[nanometre]]s long, now known to be the size of [[rhabdovirus]] particles&nbsp;– the virus that causes rabies.<ref name="Mahy 243"/>

==20th and 21st centuries==
{{see also|History of virology}}
At the turn of the 20th century, evidence for the existence of viruses was obtained from experiments with filters that had pores too small for bacteria to pass through; the term "filterable virus" was coined to describe them.<ref>Crawford (2000), p. 14</ref> Although the modern concept of a virus was at that time slowly beginning to gain acceptance, the word is ancient. In Latin it means a "slimy liquid, poison offensive odour or taste", and it first appears in the medical literature in the 18th century to describe a poisonous fluid.<ref>Baker, p. 55</ref>

Until the 1930s most scientists believed that viruses were small bacteria, but following the invention of the [[electron microscope]] in 1931 they were shown to be completely different, to a degree that not all scientists were convinced they were anything other than accumulations of toxic proteins.<ref name="pmid10905259">{{cite journal |author=Kruger DH, Schneck P, Gelderblom HR |title=Helmut Ruska and the visualisation of viruses |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9216 |pages=1713–7 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10905259 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02250-9|url=}}</ref> The situation changed radically when it was discovered that viruses contain genetic material in the form of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]].<ref>Crawford (2000), p. 15</ref> Once they were recognised as distinct biological entities they were soon shown to be the cause of numerous infections of plants, animals, and even of bacteria.<ref>Oldstone, pp. 22–40</ref>

Of the many diseases of humans that were found to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. But the diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more difficult to control.<ref>Baker, p. 70</ref> Other diseases, such as those caused by [[arboviruses]], are presenting new challenges.<ref>Levins, pp. 123–125, 157–168, 195–198, 199–205 and others</ref>

As humans have changed their behaviour during the course of history, so have viruses. In ancient times the human population was too small for pandemics to occur and, in the case of some viruses, too small for them to survive. In the 20th and 21st century increasing population densities, revolutionary changes in agriculture and farming methods, and high speed travel have contributed to the spread of new viruses and the re-appearance of old ones.<ref>Karlen, p. 229</ref><ref>Mahy, (b) p. 585</ref>  Like smallpox, some viral diseases might be conquered, but others, such as [[SARS]] will continue to present new challenges.<ref>Dobson, p. 202</ref> Although vaccines are still the most powerful weapon against viruses, in recent decades [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed to specifically target viruses as they replicate in their hosts.<ref>Carter, p. 315</ref> The 2009 influenza pandemic showed how rapidly new strains of viruses continue to spread around the world, despite efforts to contain them.<ref name="pmid20568566">{{cite journal |author=Taubenberger JK, Morens DM |title=Influenza: the once and future pandemic |journal=Public Health Reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974) |volume=125 Suppl 3 |pages=16–26 |year=2010 |pmid=20568566 |pmc=286233 |issue=7426 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7426.1238}}</ref>

[[File:Rahima Banu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rahima Banu, the last known case of naturally occurring smallpox in the world, which occurred in 1975.<ref>Glynn and Glynn, p. 219</ref>]]
Smallpox virus was one of the biggest killers of the 20th century, during which it killed 300&nbsp;million people.<ref>Oldstone, p. 4</ref> Since its emergence it has probably killed more humans than any other virus.<ref>Wolfe, p. 113</ref> In 1966 an agreement was reached by the [[World Health Assembly]] (the decision-making body of [[World Health Organisation]]) to start an "intensified smallpox eradication programme" and attempt to eradicate the disease within ten years.<ref name="Glynn 200">Glynn and Glynn p. 200</ref> At the time, smallpox was still endemic in thirty-one countries<ref name="Crawford p. 220">Crawford (2000), p. 220</ref> including Brazil, the whole of the Indian sub-continent, Indonesia and sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Glynn 200"/> This ambitious goal was considered achievable for several reasons: the vaccine afforded exceptional protection; there was only one type of the virus; there were no animals that naturally carried it; the [[incubation period]] of the infection was known and rarely varied from 12 days; and infections always gave rise to symptoms, so it was clear who had the disease and who did not.<ref>Karlen, p. 154</ref><ref>Shors, p. 388</ref>

Following mass vaccinations, disease detection and containment were central to the eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts who were vaccinated.<ref>Glynn and Glynn, p. 201</ref> Successes came quickly, by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, and by 1971 in Brazil.<ref>Glynn and Glynn, pp. 202–203</ref> By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia.<ref name="Crawford p. 220"/> Finally, after thirteen years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979.<ref name="pmid15931293">{{cite journal |author=Belongia EA, Naleway AL |title=Smallpox vaccine: the good, the bad, and the ugly |journal=Clinical Medical Research |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87–92 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=15931293 |pmc=1069029 |doi= 10.3121/cmr.1.2.87|url=http://www.clinmedres.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15931293}}</ref> Although the main weapon used was [[vaccinia virus]], which was used as the vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner had used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.<ref>Glynn and Glynn, pp. 186–189</ref>

The eradication campaign led to the death of [[Janet Parker]] (c.&nbsp;1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the [[University of Birmingham]] who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and blaming himself, Bedson cut his throat.<ref>Tucker, pp. 126–131</ref> 

Before the [[September 11 attacks]] on America in 2001, it was planned to destroy all the known remaining stocks of smallpox virus that were kept in laboratories in US and Russia. But fears of [[bioterrorism]] using smallpox virus and the possible need for the virus in the development of drugs to treat the infection have put an end to this plan.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/health/us-stockpiles-smallpox-drug-in-case-of-bioterror-attack.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 "Wary of Attack With Smallpox, U.S. Buys Up a Costly Drug", New York Times, 12 March 2013 (retrieved 25 April 2013]</ref>   Had the destruction gone ahead, smallpox virus might have been the first to be made extinct by human intervention.<ref>Oldstone, p. 84</ref>

In London between 1950 and 1968 there were epidemics every two years, but in  [[Liverpool]], which had a higher birth rate, there was an annual cycle of epidemics. During the [[Great Depression]] in the US before the Second World War the birth rate was low, and epidemics of measles were sporadic. After the war the birth rate increased, and epidemics occurred regularly every two years. In developing countries with very high birth rates, epidemics occurred every year.<ref name="pmid10650003"/> Measles is still a major problem in densely populated, less-developed countries with high birth rates and lacking effective vaccination campaigns.<ref name="pmid17327206">{{cite journal |author=Conlan AJ, Grenfell BT |title=Seasonality and the persistence and invasion of measles |journal=Proceedings.

===Poliomyelitis===

During the summers of the mid-20th century, parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis (or polio), which was commonly known as "infantile paralysis".<ref>Karlen, p. 149</ref> The disease was rare at the beginning of the century, and worldwide there were only a few thousand cases a year, but by the 1950s there were 60,000&nbsp;cases each year in the US alone.<ref>Karlen, p. 150</ref>

During 1916 and 1917 there had been a major epidemic in the US; 27,000&nbsp;cases and 6,000&nbsp;deaths were recorded, with 9,000&nbsp;cases in New York City.<ref>Dobson, pp. 163–164</ref> At the time nobody knew how the virus was spreading.<ref>Karlen, p. 151</ref> Many of the city's inhabitants, including scientists, thought that impoverished slum-dwelling immigrants were to blame even though the prevalence of the disease was higher in the more prosperous districts such as [[Staten Island]]&nbsp;– a pattern that had also been seen in  cities like Philadelphia.<ref>Karlen, p. 152</ref> Many other industrialised countries were affected at the same time. In particular, before the outbreaks in the US, large epidemics had occurred in Sweden.<ref>Mahy (b), p. 222</ref>

The reason for the rise of polio in industrialised countries in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease is caused by a virus that is passed from person to person by the [[faecal-oral route]],<ref name="Dobson, p. 166">Dobson, p. 166</ref> and only naturally infects humans.<ref name="Karlen 153">Karlen, p. 153</ref> It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence.<ref name="Dobson, p. 166"/> Although the virus was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two percent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild.<ref>Oldstone, p. 179</ref> During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.<ref name="Karlen 153"/>

Following the development of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries. In the US, following a campaign promoted by the [[March of Dimes]], the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979.<ref>Karlen, p. 153–154</ref> In 1988 the World Health Organisation along with others launched the [[Poliomyelitis eradication|Global Polio Eradication Initiative]], and by 1994 the Americas were declared to be free of disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003.<ref>Dobson, p. 165</ref> At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organisation. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in Nigeria, one in Chad, 58 in Pakistan and 37 in Afghanistan. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21381773 BBC News] Retrieved 2 March 2013</ref> In Pakistan, the campaign was  further hampered by the murder of a police officer on 26 February 2013 who was providing security. These murders were committed by Islamic militants who believe that the eradication campaign is part of a western plot against muslims.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/08/polio-workers-nigeria-shot-dead "Polio workers Nigeria shot dead" The Guardian,8 February 2013] (retrieved 25 April 2013)</ref>

HIV-1 is one of the most significant viruses to have emerged in the last quarter of the 20th&nbsp;century.<ref name="pmid12699356">{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1566524033479825 |author=Esparza J, Osmanov S |title=HIV vaccines: a global perspective |journal=Current Molecular Medicine |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=183–93 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12699356}}</ref>  When, in 1981, a scientific article was published that reported the deaths of five young gay men, no one knew that they had died from AIDS. The full scale of the epidemic&nbsp;– and that the virus had been silently emerging over several decades&nbsp;– was not known.<ref>Weeks,  pp. 15–21</ref>

HIV crossed the species barrier between chimpanzees and humans in Africa in the early decades of the 20th century. During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa. Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities, and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations. The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years, so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible.<ref>Weeks, p. 18</ref> At this time there was much scapegoating and stigmatisation.<ref>Levins, p. 279</ref> The "out of Africa" theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans, who felt that the "blame" was misplaced. This led the World Health Assembly to pass a 1987 resolution, which stated that HIV is "a naturally occurring [virus] of undetermined geographic origin".<ref>quoted in Weeks, p. 20</ref> By 2007, over 36 million people had HIV or AIDS, about 67% of them from sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>Weeks, p. 23</ref>

The HIV pandemic has challenged communities and brought about social changes throughout the world. Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed. Advice on sexual practices and drug use&nbsp;– which were once taboo&nbsp;– is sponsored by many governments and their healthcare providers. Debates on the ethics of provision and cost of anti-retroviral drugs, particularly in poorer countries, have highlighted inequalities in healthcare and stimulated far-reaching legislative changes.<ref>Weeks, pp. 303–316</ref>

===Influenza===
When influenza virus undergoes a [[genetic shift]] many humans have no immunity to the new strain, and if the population of susceptible individuals is high enough to maintain the chain of infection then pandemics occur. The genetic changes usually happen when different strains of the virus co-infect animals, particularly birds and swine. Although many viruses of vertebrates are restricted to one species, influenza virus is an exception.<ref>Barry, p. 111</ref> The last pandemic of the 19th century occurred in 1899 and resulted in the deaths of 250,000&nbsp;people in Europe. The virus, which originated in Russia or Asia, was the first to be rapidly spread by people on trains and steamships.<ref name="Karlen 144">Karlen, p. 144</ref>

A new strain of the virus emerged in 1918, and the subsequent pandemic of [[Spanish flu]] was one of the worst natural disasters in history.<ref name="Karlen 144"/> The death toll was enormous; throughout the world more than 20&nbsp;million people died from the infection, and there were 550,000&nbsp;reported deaths caused by the disease in the US, ten times the country's losses during the First World War.<ref>Karlen, p. 145</ref> Although cases of influenza occurred every winter, there were only two other pandemics in the 20th century.

In 1957 another new strain of the virus emerged and caused a pandemic of [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|Asian flu]]; although the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when [[Hong Kong flu]] emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that completely replaced the 1957 strain.<ref>Mahy, (b) p. 174</ref> Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 were killed in the US.<ref>Shors, p. 332</ref> It may be significant that new strains of influenza virus often originate in the far east; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.<ref>Crawford (2000), p. 95</ref>

The next pandemic was in 2009, but none of the last three has caused anything near the devastation seen in 1918. Exactly why the strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that still remains unanswered.<ref name="Karlen 144"/>

Arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans and other [[vertebrate]]s by blood-sucking insects. These viruses are diverse; the term "arbovirus"&nbsp;– which was derived from "arthropod borne virus"&nbsp;– is no longer  used in formal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] because many different species of virus are known to be spread in this way.<ref name="pmid16568903">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/3-540-26397-7_10 |author=Weaver SC |title=Evolutionary influences in arboviral disease |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |volume=299 |issue= |pages=285–314 |year=2006 |pmid=16568903 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=3-540-26395-0}}</ref> There are more than 500&nbsp;species of arboviruses, but in the 1930s only three were known to cause disease in humans: yellow fever, dengue fever and [[Pappataci fever]].<ref>Levins, p. 138</ref> More than 100 of such viruses are now known to cause human diseases.<ref>Mahy, (b) p. 24</ref>

Epizootics are outbreaks (epidemics) of disease among non-human animals.<ref name="isbn0-12-375158-6">{{cite book |editors=Dubovi, EJ and Maclachlan, NJ|title=Fenner's Veterinary Virology, Fourth Edition |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2010 |page=126 |isbn=0-12-375158-6}}</ref> During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included [[foot-and-mouth disease]], rinderpest of cattle, [[avian influenza|avian]] and [[swine influenza]], [[swine fever]] and [[bluetongue]] of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock can be devastating both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 has shown.<ref>Shors, p. 19–20</ref>

In the early years of the 20th century rinderpest, a disease of cattle, was common in Asia and parts of Europe.<ref>Barrett, p. 105</ref> The prevalence of the disease was steadily reduced during the course of the century by control measures that included vaccination.<ref>Barrett, p. 106</ref> By 1908 Europe was free from the disease. Outbreaks did occur following the Second World War, but these were quickly controlled. The prevalence of the disease increased in Asia, and in 1957 Thailand had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that the paddy fields could not be prepared for rice growing.<ref>Barrett, p. 109</ref> Russia west of the Urals remained free from the disease&nbsp;– [[Vladimir Lenin|lenin]] approved several laws on the control of the disease&nbsp;– but cattle in eastern Russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in Mongolia and China where the prevalence remained high.<ref>Barrett, pp. 108–109</ref> India controlled the spread of the disease, which had retained a foothold in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, throughout the 20th century,<ref>Barrett, p. 112</ref> and had eradicated the disease by 1995.<ref>Barrett, p. 119</ref> Africa suffered two major [[panzootic]]s in the 1920s and 1980s.<ref>Barrett, pp. 120–121</ref> There was a severe outbreak in Somalia in 1928 and the disease was widespread in the country until 1953. In the 1980s, outbreaks in Tanzania and Kenya were controlled by the use of 26&nbsp;million doses of vaccine, and a recurrence of the disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive vaccination campaign.<ref>Barrett, p. 122</ref> By the end of the century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries. A few pockets of infection remained in Ethiopia and Sudan,<ref>Barrett, p. 137</ref> and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) with the aim of global eradication by 2010.<ref>Barrett, pp. 136–138</ref> In May 2011, the FAO and the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] announced that "rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Final_Report_May2011.pdf |title=Joint FAO/OIE Committee on Global Rinderpest Eradication |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref>

Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious infection caused by an [[aphthovirus]], and is classified in the same family as poliovirus.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Weisse-Fliege.jpg|right|thumb|Whiteflies (''[[Trialeurodes vaporariorum]]'') are the vector of [[cassava mosaic virus]]]]
During the 20th century, many "old" diseases of plants were found to be caused by viruses. These included [[maize streak]] and [[cassava mosaic virus|cassava mosaic disease]].<ref>Carr, p. 251</ref>
As with humans, when plants thrive in close proximity, so do their viruses. This can cause huge economic losses and human tragedies. In Jordan during the 1970s, where tomatoes and [[cucurbitaceae|cucurbits]] (cucumbers, melons and gourds) were  extensively grown, entire fields were infected with viruses.<ref name="isbn0-12-429601-7">{{cite book |author=Kurstak, Edouard |title=Applied virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1984 |page=463 |isbn=0-12-429601-7}}</ref> Similarly, in Côte d'Ivoire, thirty different viruses infected crops such as [[legumes]] and vegetables. In Kenya cassava mosaic virus, maize streak virus and groundnut viral diseases caused the loss of up to 70 percent of the crop.<ref name="isbn0-12-429601-7"/>
[[Cassava]] is the most abundant crop that is grown in eastern Africa and it is a staple crop for more than 200 million people. It was introduced to Africa from South America and grows well in soils with poor fertility. The most important disease of cassava is caused by cassava mosaic virus, a [[geminiviridae|geminivirus]], which is transmitted between plants by [[whitefly|whiteflies]]. The disease was first recorded in 1894 and outbreaks of the disease occurred in eastern Africa throughout the 20th century, which often resulted in famine.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Legg, JP|title=Emergence, spread and strategies for controlling the pandemic of cassava mosaic virus disease in east and central Africa|journal=Crop Protection|year= 1999|volume=18|doi = 10.1016/S0261-2194(99)00062-9|issue = 10|page = 627}}</ref>

In the 1920s the sugarbeet growers in the western United States suffered huge economic loss caused by damage done to their crops by the leafhopper-transmitted beet curly top geminivirus. In 1956, between 25 to 50 percent of the rice crop in Cuba and Venezuela was destroyed by rice hoja blanca tenivirus. In 1958, it caused the loss of many rice fields in Columbia. Outbreaks recurred in 1981, which caused losses of up to 100 percent.<ref>Levins, pp. 181–183</ref> In Ghana between 1936 and 1977, the mealybug-transmitted cacao swollen root badnavirus caused the loss of 162 million cacao trees, and further trees were lost at the rate of 15 million each year.<ref>Levins, p. 183.</ref><ref name="HughesOdu2003">{{cite book|author1=Jacqueline d'A.

Such disasters occurred when human intervention caused ecological changes by the introduction of crops to new vectors and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees.<ref>Levins, p. 184–195</ref> New habits can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases. Before 1970, the rice yellow sobemovirus was only found in the Kisumu district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa.<ref name="Levins, p. 185">Levins, p. 185</ref> Human activity  introduced plant viruses to naive crops. The [[citrus tristeza virus]] (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid ''Toxoptera citricidus'' was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than 6 million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in São Paulo, Brazil.<ref name="Levins, p. 185"/> CTV and citrus trees probably coevolved for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases.<ref>{{Cite PMID|18705856|noedit}}</ref> Because of the problems caused by the introduction&nbsp;– by humans&nbsp;– of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Thresh JM|title=Plant Virus Epidemiology|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=978-0-08-046637-8}}</ref>

==Emerging viruses==
Emerging viruses are those that have only relatively recently infected the host species.<ref name="Crawford">Crawford (2011), p. 34</ref>  In humans, many emerging viruses have come from other animals.<ref>Crawford (2011), pp. 34–50</ref> When viruses jump to other species the diseases caused in humans are called ''[[zoonoses]]'' or ''zoonotic infections''.<ref>Levins p. 419</ref>
===SARS===
{{main|SARS}}
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is caused by a new type of [[coronavirus]].<ref>Mahy (b) p. 459</ref> Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans,<ref>{{cite pmid|22094080|noedit}}</ref> so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear.<ref name="Crawford" /> But the fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, it had ended.<ref>Crawford (2011), p. 37</ref> The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.<ref>MacLachlan p. 409</ref>

===West Nile virus===
{{main|West Nile virus}}
West Nile virus, a flavivirus,  was first identified in 1937 when it was found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe  fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in Cape Province, South Africa and 10,000 people became ill.<ref name="Mahy">Mahy (b) p. 504–505</ref> An increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York. Since then the virus has spread throughout the United States.<ref name="Mahy" /> In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in late August to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases. In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred;  in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses.<ref>{{cite pmid|17054715|noedit}}</ref> The mosquito ''(Culex modestus)'' that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north Kent. This species was not previously thought to be present in the United Kingdom, but it is widespread in southern Europe where it carries West Nile virus.<ref>{{cite pmid|22316288|noedit}}</ref>

===Nipah virus===
{{main|Henipavirus}}
In 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. Later more than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded.<ref>Crawford (2011), p. 44–45</ref> A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection was caused by a virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chua KB, Chua BH, Wang CW |title=Anthropogenic deforestation, El Niño and the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia |journal=Malays J Pathol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |year=2002 |pmid=16329551 }}</ref>

===Viral hemorragic fevers===
[[File:Marburg virus.jpg|thumb|[[Marburg virus]]]]
Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the ''[[Filoviridae]]''. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause [[viral hemorrhagic fever]], and include the [[Ebola]] and [[Marburg virus]]es. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in [[Angola]]. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, the outbreak was the world's worst epidemic of any kind of viral haemorrhagic fever.<ref name="pmid16775337">{{vcite journal

Ebola and Marburg viruses are transmitted to humans by monkeys,<ref>Mahy (b) p. 382</ref> and [[Lassa fever]] by rats (''Mastomys natalensis'').<ref>{{cite pmid|782738|noedit}}</ref> Zoonotic infections can be severe because humans often have no natural resistance to the infection and it is only when viruses become well-adapted to new host  that their virulence decreases. Some zoonotic infections are often "dead ends", in that after the initial outbreak the rate of subsequent infections subsides because the viruses are not efficient at spreading from person to person.<ref>{{cite pmid|18596867|noedit}}</ref>
