The '''Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine''' ({{lang-sv|Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin}}) administered by the [[Nobel Foundation]], is awarded once a year  for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five [[Nobel Prize]]s established  in 1895 by  Swedish chemist [[Alfred Nobel]], the inventor of [[dynamite]], in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal  provides the same profile of [[Alfred Nobel]] as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal.

As of 2011, 102 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 199 men and 10 women. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to the [[Germany|German]] [[physiologist]] [[Emil Adolf von Behring]], for his work on [[blood plasma|serum]] therapy and the development of a vaccine against [[diphtheria]]. The first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, [[Gerty Cori]], received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of [[glucose]], important in many aspects of medicine, including treatment of diabetes. In 2011, the prize was awarded to [[Bruce Beutler]] of the [[United States]] and [[Jules A. Hoffmann]] of [[France]] "for their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity" and to [[Ralph M. Steinman]] of [[Canada]] "for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity."<ref name="2011prize">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2011|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|date=3 October 2011}}</ref>

Some awards have been controversial.  This includes one to [[António Egas Moniz]] in 1949 for the [[lobotomy|prefrontal leucotomy]], bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment. Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award. The 1952 prize to [[Selman Waksman]] was litigated in court, and half the patent rights awarded to his co-discoverer [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]] who was not recognized by the prize. The 1962 prize awarded to [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] for their work on [[DNA]] structure and properties did not acknowledge the contributing work from others, such as [[Oswald Avery]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] who had died by the time of the nomination. Since the Nobel Prize rules forbid nominations of the deceased, longevity is an asset, one prize being awarded as long as 50 years after the discovery. Also forbidden is awarding any one prize to more than three recipients, and since in the last half century there has been an increasing tendency for scientists to work as teams, this rule has resulted in controversial exclusions.

==Background==
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb||Nobel was interested in experimental physiology and set up his own laboratories.]]
[[Alfred Nobel]] was born on  21 October 1833 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden into a family of engineers.<ref name="Levinovitz5">{{cite book|author=Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin|year=2001|page=5|authorlink=#Levinovitz69}}</ref> He was a chemist, engineer and inventor who amassed a fortune during his lifetime, most of it from his 355&nbsp;inventions of which dynamite is the most famous.<ref name="Levinovitz11">{{cite book|author=Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin|year=2001|page=11|authorlink=#Levinovitz69}}</ref>  He was interested in experimental physiology and set up his own labs in France and Italy to conduct experiments in blood transfusions. Keeping abreast of scientific findings, he was generous in his donations to [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s laboratory in Russia, and was optimistic about the progress resulting from scientific discoveries made in laboratories.<ref name="Feldman237-238">{{cite book|author=Feldman, Burton|year=2001|pages=237–238|authorlink=#Feldman}}</ref>

In 1888, Nobel was surprised to read his own obituary, titled ''‘The merchant of death is dead’'', in a French newspaper. As it happened, it was Nobel's brother [[Ludvig Nobel|Ludvig]] who had died, but Nobel, unhappy with the content of the obituary and concerned that his legacy would reflect poorly on him, was inspired to change his will.<ref name="Time">{{cite news | first = Frederic | last = Golden | title = The Worst And The Brightest | date = 16 October 2000 | publisher = Time Warner | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998209,00.html | work = [[Time Magazine]] | accessdate =9 April 2010}}</ref>  In his last will, Nobel requested that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[peace]], [[physiology]] or [[medicine]], and [[literature]].<ref name="BBCHistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died at the age of 63.<ref name="Sohlman13">{{cite book|author=Sohlman, Ragnar|year=1983|page=13|authorlink=#Sohlman69}}</ref>  Because his will was contested, it was not  approved by the [[Parliament of Norway|Storting]] (Norwegian Parliament)  until 26 April 1897.<ref name="Levinovitz13">{{cite book|author=Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin|year=2001|page=13|authorlink=#Levinovitz69}}</ref>

==Nomination and selection==
It was important to Nobel that the prize be awarded for a "discovery" and that it was of "greatest benefit on mankind".<ref name="Lindsten">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/articles/lindsten-ringertz-rev/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1901-2000|last=Lindsten|first=Jan|coauthors=Nils Ringertz|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>
<!--page 238-->
Per the provisions of the will, only select persons are eligible to nominate individuals for the award. These include members of academies around the world, professors of medicine in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Finland, as well as professors of selected universities and research institutions in other lands. Past Nobel laureates may also nominate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foundation Books National Council of Science|first=|title=Nobel Prize Winners in Pictures|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_K2RaFgFPCUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nobel+prize&q|year=2005|publisher=Foundation Books|isbn=81-7596-245-3|page=viii|unused_data=foundation}}</ref> Until 1977, all professors of Karolinska Institutet together decided on the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. That year, changes in Swedish law forced the Institute to make any documents pertaining to the Nobel Prize public and it was considered necessary to establish a legally independent body for the Prize work. Therefore, the Nobel Assembly was constituted, consisting of 50 professors at Karolinska Institutet. It elects the Nobel Committee with 5 members who evaluate the nominees, the Secretary who is in charge of the organization, and each year 10 adjunct members to assist in the evaluation of candidates. In 1968, a provision was added that no more than three persons may share a Nobel prize.<ref name="Levinovitz17">{{cite book|author=Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin|year=2001|page=17|authorlink=#Levinovitz69}}</ref> The 2011 winners were announced 3 October 2011.<ref name="2011prize" />

True to its mandate, the Committee has selected researchers working in the basic sciences over those who have made applied contributions. [[Harvey Cushing]], a pioneering American [[neurosurgeon]] who identified [[Cushing's syndrome]] never was awarded the prize, nor was [[Sigmund Freud]], as his [[psychoanalysis]] lacks hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.<ref name="Feldman238">{{cite book|author=Feldman, Burton|year=2001|page=238|authorlink=#Feldman}}</ref> The public expected [[Jonas Salk]] or [[Albert Sabin]] to win the prize for their development of the [[polio vaccine]]s,  but instead the award went to [[John Enders]], [[Thomas Weller]], and [[Frederick Robbins]] whose basic discovery that the polio virus could reproduce in monkey cells in laboratory preparations was a fundamental finding that led to the elimination of the disease of polio.<ref name="bishop">{{cite book|last=Bishop|first= J.

Through the 1930s, there were frequent prize winners in  classical [[Physiology]], but after that the field began dissolving into specialties. The last classical physiology winners were [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]], [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] in 1963 for their findings regarding "unitary electrical events in the central and peripheral nervous system."<ref name="Feldman239">{{cite book|author=Feldman, Burton|year=2001|page=239|authorlink=#Feldman}}</ref>

Subsequently, those selecting the recipients have exercised  wide latitude in determining what falls under the umbrella of Physiology or Medicine. The awarding of the prize in 1973 to [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]] for their observations of animal behavioral patterns could be considered a prize in the [[behavioral sciences]] rather than medicine or physiology.<ref name="Levinovitz112"/>

===Time factor and death===
Because of the length of time that may pass before the significance of a discovery becomes apparent, some prizes are awarded many years after the initial discovery. Barbara McClintock made her discoveries in 1944, before the structure of the DNA molecule was known; she  was not awarded the prize until 1983.

In 2011, Canadian immunologist [[Ralph M. Steinman]] was awarded the prize; however, unknown to the committee, he had died three days before the announcement. The committee decided that since the prize was awarded "in good faith," it would be allowed to stand.

===Controversial inclusions and exclusions===
{{main|Nobel Prize controversies}}

Some of the awards have been controversial. Who was deserving of the 1923 prize  for the discovery of [[insulin]] as a  central hormone for controlling diabetes (awarded only a year after its discovery)<ref name="Judson291">{{cite book|author=Judson, Horance|year=2004|page=291|authorlink=#Judson291}}</ref><ref name="Shalev">{{cite book|last=Shalev|first=Baruch Aba|title=100 years of Nobel prizes|url=http://books.google.com/?id=PfRaPHr86XUC&q=Frederick+Banting#v=snippet&q=Frederick%20Banting|year=2002|publisher=Americas Group|isbn=0-935047-37-9|page=73}}</ref> has been heatedly debated. It was shared between [[Frederick Banting]] and [[John James Rickard Macleod|John Macleod]];  this infuriated Banting who regarded Macleod's involvement as minimal.  Macleod was the department head at the [[University of Toronto]] but otherwise was not directly involved in the findings.  Banting  thought his laboratory partner [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]], who had shared in the laboratory work of discovery, should have shared the prize with him as well. In fairness, he decided to give half of his prize money to Best. Macleod  on his part  felt the biochemist [[James Collip]],  who joined the laboratory team later, deserved to be included in the award and shared his prize money with him.<ref name="Judson291">{{cite book|author=Judson, Horace|year=2004|page=291|authorlink=#Judson291}}</ref> Some maintain that [[Nicolae Paulescu]], a [[Romanians|Romanian]] professor of physiology at the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest]], was the first to isolate insulin, in 1916, although his pancrein was an impure aqueous extract unfit for human treatment similar to the one used previously by Israel Kleiner.<ref name="J.

In 1949, despite protests from the medical establishment, the Portuguese neurologist [[António Egas Moniz]] received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the [[prefrontal leucotomy]], which he promoted by declaring the procedure's success just 10 days postoperative. Due largely to the publicity surrounding the award, it was prescribed without regard for modern [[medical ethics]]. Favorable results were reported by such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]''.   It is estimated that around 40,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States before the procedure's popularity faded.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Lobotomist: A Maverick Medical Genius and His Tragic Quest to Rid the World of Mental Illness |last=El-Hai |first=Jack |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-23292-0 |page=14}}</ref> [[Joseph Kennedy]], the father of [[John F.

The 1952 prize, awarded solely to [[Selman Waksman]] for his discovery of [[streptomycin]], omitted the recognition some felt due to his co-discoverer [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]].<ref name="pharmj">{{cite journal|last=Ainsworth|first=Steve|title=Streptomycin: arrogance and anger|journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=276|year=2006|pages=237–238|url=http://www.pharmj.com/pdf/articles/pj_20060225_streptomycin.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="Wainwright">Wainwright, Milton ''"A Response to William Kingston, "Streptomycin, Schatz versus Waksman, and the balance of Credit for Discovery""'', Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences – Volume 60, Number 2, April 2005, pp. 218–220, Oxford University Press.</ref> There was  litigation brought by Schatz against Waksman over the details and credit of the streptomycin discovery;  Schatz was awarded a substantial settlement, and, together with Waksman, Schatz was to be officially recognized as a co-discoverer of streptomycin as concerned patent rights.

The 1962 Prize awarded to [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]]—for their work on [[DNA]] structure and properties—did not recognize contributing work from others, such as [[Alec Stokes]] and [[Herbert Wilson]].

The 2008 award went to [[Harald zur Hausen]]  in recognition of his discovery that [[HPV|human papillomavirus (HPV)]] can cause [[cervical cancer]], and to [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] and [[Luc Montagnier]] for discovering the [[Human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008 Harald zur Hausen, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, Luc Montagnier|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref> Whether [[Robert Gallo]] or Luc Montagnier deserved more credit for the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS has been a matter of [[Robert Gallo#HIV/AIDS research and subsequent controversy|considerable controversy]].

===Limits on number of awardees===
The provision that restricts the maximum number of nominees to three for any one prize, introduced in 1968,  has caused considerable controversy.<ref name="Levinovitz17"/><ref name="Levinovitz61">{{cite book|author=Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin|year=2001|page=61|authorlink=#Levinovitz69}}</ref>  From the 1950s onward, there has been an increasing trend to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to more than one person. There were 59    people who received the prize in the first 50 years of the last century, while 113 individuals received it  between 1951 and    2000. This increase could be attributed to the rise of the international scientific community after World    War II, resulting in more persons being responsible for the discovery, and nominated for, a particular prize. Also, current    biomedical research is more often carried out by teams rather than by scientists    working alone, making it unlikely that any one scientist, or even a few, is primarily responsible for a discovery;<ref name="bishop"/> this has meant that a  prize nomination  that would have to  include more than three contributors is automatically excluded from consideration.<ref name="Levinovitz114"/> Also, deserving contributors may not be nominated at all because  the restriction results in a cut off point of three nominees per prize, leading to controversial exclusions.<ref name="Lindsten">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/articles/lindsten-ringertz-rev/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1901-2000|last=Lindsten|first=Jan|coauthors=Nils Ringertz|date=26 June 2001|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref>

==Years without awards==
There have been nine years in which the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was not awarded (1915–1918, 1921, 1925, 1940–1942). Most of these occurred during either World War I (1914–1918) or World War II (1939–1945).<ref name="prizefacts"/> In 1939, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]] forbade  [[Gerhard Domagk]] from accepting his prize.<ref name="Levinovitz23">{{cite book|author=Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin|year=2001|page=23|authorlink=#Levinovitz69}}</ref> He was later able to receive the diploma and medal but not the money.<ref name="prizefacts">{{cite web | title = Nobel Laureates Facts | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/nobelprize_facts.html|accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|title=The Nobel Prize|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CNnZKHxQpO4C&q=Richard+Kuhn#search_anchor|year=1983|publisher=Springwood Books|isbn=0-86254-111-5|page=85}}</ref>
