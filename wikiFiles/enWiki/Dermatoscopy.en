[[Image:Dermatoscope.jpg|thumb|Polarized light dermatoscope.]]

'''Dermatoscopy''' (also known as '''dermoscopy''' or '''epiluminescence microscopy''') is the examination of [[skin lesions]] with a '''dermatoscope'''. This traditionally consists of a magnifier (typically x10), a non-polarised light source, a transparent plate and a liquid medium between the instrument and the [[skin]], and allows inspection of skin lesions unobstructed by skin surface reflections. Modern dermatoscopes dispense with the use of liquid medium and instead use polarised light to cancel out skin surface reflections. When the images or video clips are digitally captured or processed, the instrument can be referred to as a "digital epiluminescence dermatoscope".

This instrument is useful to [[dermatologist]]s in distinguishing benign from [[malignant]] (cancerous) lesions, especially in the diagnosis of [[malignant melanoma|melanoma]].

==Advantages of dermatoscopy==
With doctors who are experts in the specific field of dermoscopy, the diagnostic accuracy for melanoma is significantly better than for those dermatologists who do not have any specialized training in dermatoscopy.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10429989 |year=1999 |last1=Lorentzen |first1=H |last2=Weismann |last3=Petersen |last4=Larsen |last5=Secher |last6=Skødt |title=Clinical and dermatoscopic diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

Thus, with specialists trained in dermoscopy, there is considerable improvement in the sensitivity (detection of melanomas) as well as specificity (percentage of non-melanomas correctly diagnosed as benign), compared with naked eye examination. The accuracy by dermatoscopy was increased up to 20% in the case of sensitivity and up to 10% in the case of specificity, compared with naked eye examiation.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18616769 |year=2008 |last1=Vestergaard |first1=ME |last2=Macaskill |last3=Holt |last4=Menzies |title=Dermoscopy compared with naked eye examination for the diagnosis of primary melanoma: a meta-analysis of studies performed in a clinical setting |volume=159 |issue=3 |pages=669–76 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08713.x |journal= [[British Journal of Dermatology]] |first2=P |first3=PE |first4=SW}}{{cite journal |pmid=9875194 |doi=10.1001/archderm.134.12.1563 |year=1998 |last1=Argenziano |first1=G |last2=Fabbrocini |last3=Carli |last4=De Giorgi |last5=Sammarco |last6=Delfino |title=Epiluminescence microscopy for the diagnosis of doubtful melanocytic skin lesions.

In the studies referred to, a comparison is made between dermatoscopy and an artificial situation of only naked eye examination. In reality, most of the 80% of US dermatologists who do not employ dermatoscopy work in bright rooms and use various magnifiers.

==Application of dermatoscopy==
# The typical application of dermatoscopy is early detection of [[melanoma]] (see above)
# Digital dermatoscopy (videodermatoscopy) is used for monitoring skin lesions suspicious of melanoma. Digital dermatoscopy images are stored and compared to images obtained during the patient’s next visit. Suspicious changes in such a lesion are an indication for excision. Skin lesions, which appear unchanged over time are considered benign.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18510663 |year=2008 |last1=Argenziano |first1=G |last2=Mordente |last3=Ferrara |last4=Sgambato |last5=Annese |last6=Zalaudek |title=Dermoscopic monitoring of melanocytic skin lesions: clinical outcome and patient compliance vary according to follow-up protocols |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08649.x |journal=The British journal of dermatology |first2=I |first3=G |first4=A |first5=P |first6=I}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3315/jdcr.2007.1.1001 |title=Slow-growing melanoma: Report of five cases |year=2007 |last1=Roma |first1=Paolo |last2=Savarese |last3=Martino |last4=Martino |last5=Annese |last6=Capoluongo |last7=Mordente |last8=Nicolino |last9=Zalaudek |journal=Journal of Dermatological Case Reports |volume=1 |first2=Imma |first3=Antonia |first4=Domenico |first5=Pietro |first6=Patrizio |first7=Ines |first8=Rachele |first9=Iris}}</ref> Common systems for digital dermoscopy are [[Fotofinder]], [[Molemax]] or [[Easyscan]].

# Determination of surgical margin of hard to define skin cancers. Examples would be Bowen’s disease, superficial basal cell carcinomas, and lentigo malignas. These tumors have very indistinct margins. By allowing the surgeon to correctly identify the true extent of the tumor, repeat surgery often is decreased.

==History==
Skin surface microscopy started in 1663 by [[Kolhaus]] and was improved with the addition of immersion oil in 1878 by [[Ernst Abbe]]. The German dermatologist, [[Johann Saphier]], added a built-in light source to the instrument. [[Goldman]] was the first dermatologist to coin the term "dermascopy" and to use the dermatoscope to evaluate pigmented cutaneous lesions.

In 2001, a California medical device manufacturer, 3Gen, introduced the first polarized dermatoscope, the DermLite. Polarised illumination, coupled with a cross-polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians no longer have to stop and apply immersion oil, alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate.
