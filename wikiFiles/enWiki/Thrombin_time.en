The '''thrombin time''' (TT), also known as the '''thrombin clotting time''' (TCT) is a [[blood test]] that measures the time it takes for a [[clot]] to form in the plasma of a blood sample containing [[anticoagulant]], after an excess of [[thrombin]] has been added.<ref name="isbn1-4051-8460-4">{{cite book |author=David Lillicrap; Nigel Key; Michael Makris; Denise O'Shaughnessy |title=Practical Hemostasis and Thrombosis |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2009 |page=53 |isbn=1-4051-8460-4 }}</ref> It is used to diagnose blood [[coagulation]] disorders and to assess the effectiveness of fibrinolytic therapy.  This test is repeated with pooled plasma from normal patients. The difference in time between the test and the 'normal' indicates an abnormality in the conversion of [[fibrinogen]] (a soluble protein) to fibrin, an insoluble protein.<ref name="pmid21858738">{{cite journal |author=Popović M, Smiljanić K, Dobutović B, Syrovets T, Simmet T, Isenović ER |title=Thrombin and vascular inflammation |journal=Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry |volume=359 |issue=1-2 |pages=301–13 |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=21858738 |doi=10.1007/s11010-011-1024-x |url=}}</ref>

The thrombin time compares the rate of clot formation to that of a sample of normal pooled plasma. Thrombin is added to the samples of plasma. If the time it takes for the plasma to clot is prolonged, a quantitative (fibrinogen deficiency) or qualitative (dysfunctional fibrinogen) defect is present.<ref name="isbn1-4051-8050-1">{{cite book |author=Hatton, Chris |title=Haematology (Lecture Notes) |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2008 |page=156 |isbn=1-4051-8050-1}}</ref> In  blood samples containing [[heparin]], a substance derived from snake venom called [[batroxobin]]<ref>[http://www.american-diagnostica.de/fileadmin/user_upload/datasheets/520REG.pdf Batroxobin factsheet]</ref> (formerly reptilase) is used instead of thrombin. Batroxobin has a similar action to thrombin but unlike thrombin it is not inhibited by heparin.<ref name="isbn1-4051-8460-4"/>

Normal values for thrombin time are 12 to 14 seconds.<ref name="isbn0-632-05153-1">{{cite book |author=Hoffbrand, A. V. |title=Essential haematology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2002 |page=248 |isbn=0-632-05153-1 }}</ref> If batroxobin is used, the time should be between 15 and 20 seconds. Thrombin time can be prolonged by heparin, fibrin degradation products, factor XIII deficiency, and fibrinogen deficiency or abnormality.

==Test procedure==
After separating the plasma from the whole blood by [[centrifugation]], bovine [[thrombin]] is added to the sample of plasma. Clot formation is detected optically or mechanically by a coagulation instrument. The time between the addition of the thrombin and the clot formation is recorded as the thrombin clotting time.

==Specimen requirements==
Whole blood is taken with either [[citrate]] or [[oxalate]] additive (if using the [[vacutainer]] system, this is a light blue top tube).  As with other coagulation assays, the tube must not be over- or under-filled in order to ensure the correct anticoagulant-to-blood ratio:  one part anticoagulant per nine parts blood.

==Reference ranges==
The [[reference interval|reference ranges]] of the Thrombin Clotting time is generally <22 seconds,<ref name="pmid1904284">{{cite journal |author=Gastineau DA, Gertz MA, Daniels TM, Kyle RA, Bowie EJ |title=Inhibitor of the thrombin time in systemic amyloidosis: a common coagulation abnormality |journal=Blood |volume=77 |issue=12 |pages=2637–40 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=1904284 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1904284}}</ref> and from 14 to 16 seconds.<ref name="isbn0-632-05153-1"/> Laboratories usually calculate their own ranges, based on the method used and the results obtained from healthy individuals from the local population, and separate ranges for infants are used.<ref>[http://www.practical-haemostasis.com/Screening%20Tests/tt.html Practical Haemostasis]</ref>

==Limitations==
Blood samples that are old{{Vague|how old is old?|date=September 2012}} or [[hemolysis|hemolysed]]{{Dubious|sensitivity to haemolysis depends on the assay method|date=September 2012}} cannot be tested .
