The '''International Prognostic Index (IPI)''' is a clinical tool developed by oncologists to aid in predicting the [[prognosis]] of patients with aggressive [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. Prior to 1993, when the IPI was developed, the primary consideration in assessing prognosis was the [[Ann Arbor staging|Ann Arbor stage]] alone, but this was increasingly found to be an inadequate means of predicting survival outcomes, and so other factors were studied.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 2031 patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, of all ages, treated with a [[doxorubicin]]-based chemotherapy regimen such as [[CHOP]] between 1982 and 1987.<ref>A predictive model for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project. N Engl J Med 1993;329(14):987-94</ref> Several patient characteristics were analyzed to determine whether they were associated with differences in survival, and the factors that emerged as significant were, in addition to the Ann Arbor stage: age, elevated serum [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), [[performance status]], and number of extranodal sites of disease.

== International Prognostic Index ==

One point is assigned for each of the following risk factors:

* Age greater than 60 years
* [[Cancer staging|Stage]] III or IV disease
* Elevated serum LDH
* [[Performance status|ECOG/Zubrod]] performance status of 2, 3, or 4
* More than 1 extranodal site

The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups:
* Low risk (0-1 points) - 5-year survival of 73%
* Low-intermediate risk (2 points) - 5-year survival of 51%
* High-intermediate risk (3 points) - 5-year survival of 43%
* High risk (4-5 points) - 5-year survival of 26%

== Age-Adjusted IPI ==
A simplified index can be used when comparing patients within an age group (i.e. 60 or younger, or over 60) and includes only 3 of the above factors:

* Stage
* LDH
* Performance status

The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups:
* Low risk (0 points) - 5-year survival of 83%
* Low-intermediate risk (1 point) - 5-year survival of 69%
* High-intermediate risk (2 points) - 5-year survival of 46%
* High risk (3 points) - 5-year survival of 32%


Although the IPI has shown itself to be a useful clinical tool, widely used by oncologists and a mainstay of risk stratification in clinical trials for lymphoma, it should be kept in mind that it was developed prior to the use of [[rituximab]], which is now included with anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy as of the standard of care in [[B-cell]] lymphomas (the majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas). Rituximab has dramatically improved the outcomes of lymphoma patients, and its effect on the prognostic value of the IPI is uncertain.

== Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) ==
Given the success of the IPI for intermediate grade lymphomas, an effort was undertaken to develop a similar prognostic index for the most common low-grade lymphoma, [[follicular lymphoma]]. The prognostic factors that emerged from this were: age, stage, number of lymph node areas involved, serum [[hemoglobin]] level, and serum LDH.<ref>Solal-CÃ©ligny et al. Follicular lymphoma international prognostic index. Blood 2004;104(5):1258-1265.</ref>

One point is assigned for each of the following adverse prognostic factors:
* Age greater than 60 years
* Stage III or IV disease
* Greater than 4 lymph node groups involved
* Serum hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL
* Elevated serum LDH

The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups:
* Low risk (0-1 points) - 5 and 10-year survivals of 91% and 71%, respectively
* Intermediate risk (2 points) - 5 and 10-year survivals of 78% and 51%, respectively
* High risk (3-5 points) - 5 and 10-year survivals of 53% and 36%, respectively

== Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) ==

An effort was more recently undertaken to identify a similar prognostic index predictive of outcome in advanced mantle cell lymphoma. There were four factors found to have independent prognostic relevance: age, performance status, LDH, and white blood cell count (WBC).<ref>Hoster et al. A new prognostic index (MIPI) for patients with advanced-stage mantle cell lymphoma. Blood 2008;111(2):558-565.</ref>

The point values are assigned as follows:
* 0 points: Age less than 50 years, ECOG performance status of 0-1, LDH less than 0.67 of the upper limit of normal, or WBC of less than 6,700 cells/mcl
* 1 point: Age 50-59, LDH 0.67-0.99 of the upper limit of normal, or WBC 6,700 to 9,999 cells/mcl
* 2 points: Age 60-69, ECOG performance status of 2-4, LDH 1-1.49 times the upper limit of normal, or WBC 10,000-14,000 cells/mcl
* 3 points: Age 70 or greater, LDH 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or greater, and WBC of 15,000 cells/mcl or greater

The sum of the allotted points correlates with the following risk groups:
* Low risk (0-3 points) - median survival not yet reached
* Intermediate risk (4-5 points) - median survival of 51 months
* High risk (6-11 points) - median survival of 29 months
