A '''histamine antagonist''' (commonly called an '''antihistamine''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] that inhibits the action of [[histamine]] by blocking it from attaching to [[histamine receptor]]s; or it may inhibit the enzymatic activity of histidine decarboxylase, catalyzing the transformation of histidine into histamine (atypical antihistaminics).

Antihistamines are commonly used for the relief of [[Protein allergy|allergies]] caused by intolerance of proteins.<ref>Sicherer, Scott H. M.D., Understanding and Managing Your Child's Food Allergy. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006 ISBN 0-8018-8492-6.</ref>

== Clinical effects ==
[[Histamine]]s produce increased vascular permeability, causing fluid to escape from capillaries into tissues, which leads to the classic symptoms of an allergic reaction — a runny nose and watery eyes.  [[Histamine]] also promotes [[angiogenesis]].

Antihistamines suppress the histamine-induced [[Cutaneous condition#Morphology|wheal response]] (swelling) and [[Vasodilation|flare response]] (vasodilation) by blocking the binding of histamine to its receptors on nerves, vascular smooth muscle, glandular cells, endothelium, and mast cells. They exert a competitive antagonism to histamines.

Itching and sneezing are suppressed by antihistamine blocking of [[H1-receptor]]s on nasal sensory nerves.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9042073|title=Appraisal of the validity of histmine-induced wheal and flare is used to predict the clinical efficacy of antihistamines|year=1997|last1=Monroe|first1=EW|last2=Daly|first2=AF|last3=Shalhoub|first3=RF|volume=99|issue=2|pages=S798–806|journal=The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology}}</ref>
Antihistamines have also been used with great success in the treatment of [[Brown Recluse]] (genus [[Loxosceles]]) [[spider bites]] as well as other insect bites that cause [[necrosis]].<ref>Paul K. Carlton  Jr,  MD, FACS  The Texas A&M University Health Science Center, College Station, Tex</ref>

==Clinical: H<sub>1</sub>- and H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists==

===H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists===
{{Main|H1 antagonist|l1=H<sub>1</sub> antagonist}}

In common use, the term antihistamine refers only to compounds that have inhibit action at the H<sub>1</sub> receptor (and not H<sub>2</sub>, etc). 

Rather than "true" [[receptor antagonists|antagonists]], H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines are actually [[inverse agonist]]s at the histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M | year=2002 | title=H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects | journal=Clin Exp Allergy | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=489–98 | pmid=11972592 | doi=10.1046/j.0954-7894.2002.01314.x}}</ref>  Clinically, H<sub>1</sub> antagonists are used to treat [[allergic]] reactions.  Sedation is a common side-effect, and some H<sub>1</sub> antagonists, such as [[diphenhydramine]] and [[doxylamine]], are also used to treat insomnia. However, [[second-generation antihistamine]]s do not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], and as such do not cause drowsiness.

Examples:
*[[Acrivastine]]
*[[Azelastine]]
*[[Brompheniramine]]
*[[Buclizine]]
*[[Bromodiphenhydramine]]
*[[Carbinoxamine]]
*[[Cetirizine]]
*[[Chlorpromazine]] (antipsychotic)
*[[Cyclizine]]
*[[Chlorpheniramine]]
*[[Chlorodiphenhydramine]]
*[[Clemastine]]
*[[Cyproheptadine]]
*[[Desloratadine]]
*[[Dexbrompheniramine]]
*[[Dexchlorpheniramine]]
*[[Dimenhydrinate]] (most commonly used as an [[antiemetic]])
*[[Dimetindene]]
*[[Diphenhydramine]] ([[Benadryl]])
*[[Doxylamine]] (most commonly used as an [[Over-the-counter drug|OTC]] [[sedative]])
*[[Ebastine]]
*[[Embramine]]
*[[Fexofenadine]]
*[[Levocetirizine]]
*[[Loratadine]]
*[[Meclozine]] (most commonly used as an [[antiemetic]])
*[[Mirtazapine]] (primarily used to treat depression, also has antiemetic and appetite-stimulating effects)
*[[Olopatadine]] (used locally)
*[[Orphenadrine]] (a close relative of diphenhydramine used mainly as a skeletal muscle relaxant and anti-Parkinsons agent)
*[[Phenindamine]]
*[[Pheniramine]]
*[[Phenyltoloxamine]]
*[[Promethazine]]
*[[Pyrilamine]]
*[[Quetiapine]] (antipsychotic)
*[[Rupatadine]]
*[[Tripelennamine]]
*[[Triprolidine]]

===H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists===
{{Main|H2 antagonist|l1=H<sub>2</sub> antagonist}}

H<sub>2</sub> antagonists, like H<sub>1</sub> antagonists, are also [[inverse agonist]]s and not true [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]]. They act on [[Histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub>]] histamine receptors found principally in the [[parietal cell]]s of the [[stomach|gastric]] mucosa, which are part of the endogenous signaling pathway for [[gastric acid]] secretion.  Normally, histamine acts on H<sub>2</sub> to stimulate acid secretion; drugs that block H<sub>2</sub> signaling thus reduce the secretion of gastric acid.  
H<sub>2</sub> antagonists are among first-line therapy to treat [[gastrointestinal]] conditions including [[peptic ulcer]]s and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].  Some formulations are available over the counter.  Most side effects are due to cross-reactivity with unintended receptors.  Cimetidine, for example, is notorious for antagonizing androgenic testosterone and DHT receptors at high doses.

Examples:
*[[Cimetidine]]
*[[Famotidine]]
*[[Lafutidine]]
*[[Nizatidine]]
*[[Ranitidine]]
*[[Roxatidine]]

==Experimental: H<sub>3</sub>- and H<sub>4</sub>-receptor antagonists==
These are experimental agents and do not yet have a defined clinical use, although a number of drugs are currently in human trials. H<sub>3</sub>-antagonists have a [[stimulant]] and [[nootropic]] effect, and are being investigated for the treatment of conditions such as [[ADHD]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[schizophrenia]], whereas H<sub>4</sub>-antagonists appear to have an [[immunomodulator]]y role and are being investigated as [[anti-inflammatory]] and [[analgesic]] drugs.

===H<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonists===
{{Main|H3 antagonist|l1=H<sub>3</sub> antagonist}}
Examples:
* [[A-349,821]]
* [[ABT-239]]
* [[Ciproxifan]]
* [[Clobenpropit]]
* [[Conessine]]
* [[Thioperamide]]

===H<sub>4</sub>-receptor antagonists===

Examples:
* [[Thioperamide]]
* [[JNJ 7777120]]
* [[VUF-6002]]

==Others==

===Atypical antihistaminics===
They inhibit the enzymatic activity of [[histidine decarboxylase]] :
* [[tritoqualine]] 
* [[catechin]]

===Mast cell stabilizers===
{{Main|Mast cell stabilizer}}
Mast cell stabilizers appear to stabilize the mast cells to prevent degranulation and mediator release. These drugs are not usually classified as histamine antagonists, but have similar indications.

Examples:
* [[Cromoglicate]] (cromolyn)
* [[Nedocromil]]
* [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist]]

===Other agents with antihistaminergic activity===
Many drugs used for other indications possess unwanted antihistaminergic activity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
