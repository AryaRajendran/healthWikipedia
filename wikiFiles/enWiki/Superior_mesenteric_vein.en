In [[anatomy]], the '''superior mesenteric vein''' (SMV) is a [[blood vessel]] that drains [[blood]] from the [[small intestine]] ([[jejunum]] and [[ileum]]).  At its termination behind the neck of the [[pancreas]], the SMV combines with the [[splenic vein]] to form the [[hepatic portal vein]].  The SMV lies to the right of the similarly named artery, the [[superior mesenteric artery]], which originates from the [[abdominal aorta]].

==Tributaries==
Tributaries of the superior mesenteric vein drain the [[small intestine]], [[large intestine]], [[stomach]], [[pancreas]] and [[vermiform appendix|appendix]] and include:
* [[Right gastro-omental vein]] (also known as the right gastro-epiploic vein)
* [[inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins]]
* [[veins from jejunum]]
* [[veins from ileum]]
* [[middle colic vein]] - drains the [[transverse colon]]
* [[right colic vein]] - drains the [[ascending colon]]
* [[ileocolic vein]]

==Disorders==
Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein is quite rare, but a significant cause of [[mesenteric ischemia]] and can be fatal.  It is estimated that 10-15% of mesenteric [[ischemia]] is due to mesenteric [[thrombosis]].{{ref|Tessier}}
