The '''partial thromboplastin time''' (PTT) or '''activated partial thromboplastin time''' ('''aPTT''' or '''APTT''') is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of both the "intrinsic" (now referred to as the [[contact activation pathway]]) and the common coagulation pathways. Apart from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting,<ref name="urlMedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003653.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) |work= |accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> it is also used to monitor the treatment effects with [[heparin]], a major [[anticoagulant]].  It is used in conjunction with the [[prothrombin time]] (PT) which measures the ''extrinsic pathway''. '''Kaolin cephalin clotting time''' (KccT) is a historic name for the activated partial thromboplastin time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gpnotebook.com/simplepage.cfm?ID=-1207566306 | title = KCCT - General Practice Notebook | accessdate = 2010-06-08 | work = GP Notebook | publisher = Oxbridge Solutions Ltd}}</ref>

==Method==
Blood samples are collected in tubes with [[oxalate]] or [[citrate]] to arrest coagulation by binding calcium. 
The specimen is then delivered to the laboratory.  In order to activate the intrinsic pathway, [[phospholipid]], an activator (such as [[silica]], 
[[celite]], [[kaolin]], [[ellagic acid]]), and [[calcium]] (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the oxalate) are mixed into the [[blood plasma|plasma]] 
sample. The time is measured until a [[thrombus]] (clot) forms.  This testing is performed by a [[medical technologist]].

The test is termed "partial" due to the absence of [[tissue factor]] from the reaction mixture.

==Interpretation==
The typical reference range is between 30 [[second]]s and 50 s  (depending on laboratory). Shortening of the PTT is considered to have little clinical relevance, but some research indicates that it might increase risk of thromboembolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfgang Korte, MD, Susan Clarke, MT(ASCP), and Jerry B. Lefkowitz, MD |title=Short Activated Partial Thromboplastin Times Are Related to Increased Thrombin Generation and an Increased Risk for Thromboembolism |journal=Am J Clin Pathol. |issue=113 |pages=123–127 |year=2000}}</ref> Normal PTT times require the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, & XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test. Prolonged APTT may indicate:
* use of [[heparin]] (or contamination of the sample)
* [[antiphospholipid antibody]] (especially [[lupus anticoagulant]], which paradoxically increases propensity to [[thrombosis]])
* coagulation factor deficiency (e.g. [[hemophilia]])
* Sepsis - coagulation factor consumption
* Presence of antibodies against coagulation factors (Factor inhibitors)

To distinguish the above causes, [[mixing test]]s are performed, in which the patient's plasma is mixed (initially at a 50:50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an "inhibitor" (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does correct a factor deficiency is more likely. Deficiencies of [[factor VIII|factors VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor XI|XI]] and [[factor XII|XII]] and rarely [[von Willebrand factor]] (if causing a low factor VIII level) may lead to a prolonged aPTT correcting on mixing studies.

==History==
The aPTT was first described in 1953 by researchers at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Langdell RD, Wagner RH, Brinkhous KM |title=Effect of antihemophilic factor on one-stage clotting tests; a presumptive test for hemophilia and a simple one-stage antihemophilic factor assy procedure |journal=J.
