The main applications are currently in imaging of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastro-intestinal tract]], particularly for the diagnosis and characterisation of [[Barrett's esophagus|Barrett’s Esophagus]], pancreatic cysts and colorectal lesions.

==Principles==
Conventional, widefield microscopy is generally unsuitable for imaging thick tissue because the images are corrupted by a blurred, out-of-focus background signal.<ref>Wilson, T., Optical sectioning in fluorescence microscopy. Journal of microscopy, 2011. 242: p. 111-6.</ref> Endomicroscopes achieve optical sectioning (removal of the background intensity) using the [[confocal microscopy|confocal principle]] - each image frame is assembled in a point-by-point fashion by scanning a laser spot rapidly over the tissue. In table-top confocal microscopes the [[laser scanning|scanning]] is usually performed using bulky galvanometer or resonant scanning mirrors. Endomicroscopes either have a miniaturised scanning head at the distal tip of the imaging probe, or perform the scanning outside of the patient and use an imaging fibre bundle to transfer the scan pattern to the tissue.<ref name="Jabbour" />

===Fibre Bundle Endomicroscopes===
Fibre bundles were originally developed for use in flexible [[endoscopy|endoscopes]].<ref>H.H.Hopkins and N.S.Kapany, A flexible fibrescope, using static scanning. Nature, 1954. 187: p. 39-40.</ref> and have since been adapted for use in endomicroscopy.<ref>Gmitro, A.F. and D. Aziz, Confocal microscopy through a fiber-optic imaging bundle. Optics Letters, 1993. 18: p. 565-567.</ref><ref>Makhlouf, H., et al., Multispectral confocal microendoscope for in vivo and in situ imaging. Journal of biomedical optics, 2008. 13: p. 044016.</ref><ref name="Goualher">Goualher, G.L., et al. Towards Optical Biopsies with an Integrated Fibered Confocal Fluorescence Microscope. in MICCAI 2004. 2004.</ref> They consist of a large number (up to tens of thousands) of fibre cores inside a single shared cladding, are flexible, and have diameters on the order of a millimetre. In a coherent fibre bundle the relative positions of the cores are maintained along the fibre, meaning that an image projected onto one end of the bundle will be transferred to the other end without scrambling. Therefore, if one end of the bundle is placed at the focus of a table-top confocal microscope, the bundle will act as a flexible extension and allow endoscopic operation.
Since only the cores, and not the cladding, transmit light, image processing must be applied to remove the resulting honeycomb-like appearance of the images.<ref>Perchant, A., G.L. Goualher, and F. Berier, Method for Processing an image acquired through a guide consisting of a plurality of optical fibers. 2011.</ref> Each core essentially acts as an image pixel, and so the spacing between fibre cores limits the resolution. The addition of micro-optics at the distal tip of the bundle allows for magnification and hence higher resolution imaging, but at the cost of reducing the field-of-view.

===Distal Scanning Endomicroscopes===
Distal scanning endomicroscopes incorporate a miniature 2D scanning apparatus into the imaging probe.  The laser excitation and returning fluorescent emission are sent to and received from the scanning head using an optical fibre. Most experimental devices have either used [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] scanning mirrors,<ref>Dickensheets, D.L., G.S. Kino, and L. Fellow, Silicon-Micromachined Scanning Confocal Optical Microscope. Scanning, 1998. 7: p. 38-47.</ref> or direct translation of the fibre using [[Piezoelectricity|piezo-electrics]].<ref name="Polglase">Polglase, A.L., W.J. Mclaren, and S.A. Skinner, A fluorescence confocal endomicroscope for in vivo microscopy of the upper- and the lower-GI tract. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 2005. 62.</ref>

===Non-Confocal Endomicroscopes===
Widefield endomicroscopes (i.e. non-depth sectioning microscopes) have been developed for select applications,<ref>Pierce, M.C., et al., Low-cost endomicroscopy in the esophagus and colon. Am J Gastroenterol, 2012. 2011: p. 1722-1724.</ref> including the imaging of cells ''ex vivo''.<ref>Pierce, M., D. Yu, and R. Richards-Kortum, High-resolution fiber-optic microendoscopy for in situ cellular imaging. Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE, 2011: p. 8-11.</ref> Optical coherence tomography and multi-photon microscopy have both been demonstrated endoscopically.<ref name="Jung" /><ref>Huo, L., et al., Forward-viewing resonant fiber-optic scanning endoscope of appropriate scanning speed for 3D OCT imaging. Optics express, 2010. 18: p. 14375-84.</ref> Successful implementations have used distal scanning rather than fibre bundles due to problems with [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and light loss.

==Commercial Products==
Two endomicroscope products have been developed: the Pentax ISC-1000/EC3870CIK ([[Pentax]]/[[Hoya Corporation|Hoya]], Tokyo, Japan), now withdrawn, and Cellvizio ([[Mauna Kea Technologies]], Paris, France). The Pentax Medical device is pre-packaged into an endoscope, and uses electrostatic-controlled scanning of a fibre to perform the confocal scanning at the distal tip of the device. This provides sub-micrometre resolution, but results in a maximum frame rate of 1.2 fps.<ref name="Polglase" /> Mauna Kea’s Cellvizio device has an external laser scanning unit and offers a selection of fibre-bundle based probes with resolution, field of view and working distance optimised for different applications. These probes are compatible with standard endoscope instrument channels, and have a frame rate of 12&nbsp;Hz.<ref name="Goualher" />

==Applications==
The majority of clinical trials have focused on applications in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, particularly the detection and characterisation of pre-cancerous lesions. Mauna Kea’s Cellvizio has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance and a European CE Mark for use in the GI and pulmonary tracts.<ref name="Jabbour"/> Research studies have suggested a large range of potential applications, including in the urinary tract,<ref name="Sonn" /> head and neck,<ref>Haxel, B.R., et al., Confocal endomicroscopy: a novel application for imaging of oral and oropharyngeal mucosa in human.
