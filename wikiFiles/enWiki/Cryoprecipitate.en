'''Cryoprecipitate''', also called "Cryoprecipitated Antihaemophilic Factor", "Cryoprecipitated AHF", and "cryo" for short, is a frozen blood product prepared from [[Blood plasma|plasma]]. 

It is often transfused as a four to six unit pool instead of as a single product.  Many uses of the product have been replaced by factor concentrates, but it is still routinely stocked by many [[hospital]] [[blood bank]]s.

Like [[fresh frozen plasma]], compatibility testing is not strictly necessary, but cryo is given as [[ABO blood group system|ABO compatible]] when possible.  (Compatibility is reversed for plasma products: AB type is the universal plasma donor and O type is the universal plasma recipient.) <!-- Do not "fix" this, it is correct.  Type "O" as universal donor only applies to Red Blood Cells.-->

==Composition==
Each 15 mL unit typically contains 100 IU of [[factor VIII]], and 250 mg of [[fibrinogen]].  It also contains [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF) and [[factor XIII]].  

US standards require manufacturers to test at least four units each month, and the products must have an average of 150 mg or more of fibrinogen and 80 IU of factor VIII.<ref>

Typical values for a unit are substantially higher, and aside from infants it is rare to [[Blood transfusion|transfuse]] just one unit.

* [[Haemophilia]] - Used for emergency back up when factor concentrates are not available.
* [[von Willebrands's disease]] - Not currently recommended unless last reserve. [[Desmopressin|ddAVP]] is first line, followed by factor concentrates.
* [[Hypofibrinogenaemia]] (low [[fibrinogen]] levels), as can occur with massive transfusions
* Bleeding from excessive [[anticoagulation]] - Fresh frozen plasma contains most of the coagulation factors and is a much better choice when anticoagulation has to be reversed quickly.
* Massive [[haemorrhage]] - [[Red blood cell|RBCs]] and [[Blood substitutes|volume expanders]] are preferred therapies.
* [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]
