'''Cooks syndrome''' is a hereditary disorder which is characterized in the hands by bilateral nail [[hypoplasia]] on the [[thumb]], [[index finger]], and [[middle finger]], absence of fingernails ([[anonychia]]) on the [[ring finger]] and [[little finger]], lengthening of the thumbs, and bulbousness of the fingers. In the feet, it is characterized by absence of toenails and absence/hypoplasia of the [[distal phalanges]].<ref name="Nevin"/> In the second study of this disorder, it was found that the [[intermediate phalanges]], [[proximal phalanges]], and [[metacarpals]] were unaffected.<ref name="Nevin"/> 

The disorder was first described by Cooks ''et al'' in 1985 after being discovered in two generations of one family. It was proposed that the inheritance of the disorder is [[autosomal dominant]].<ref name="Cooks">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1985.tb00189.x | title = A new nail dysplasia syndrome with onychonychia and absence and/or hypoplasia of distal phalanges. | author = Cooks, R.

Although several genetic disorders exist which can cause [[anonychia]] and [[onychodystrophy]], such disorders often cause other anomalies such as deafness, [[mental retardation]], and defects of the hair, eyes, and teeth. Cooks syndrome is not known to cause any such anomalies.<ref name="Nevin">{{cite journal |author=Nevin NC, Thomas PS, Eedy DJ, Shepherd C |title=Anonychia and absence/hypoplasia of distal phalanges (Cooks syndrome): report of a second family |journal=J.

In 1999, a pair of siblings was found with [[brachydactyly]] type B. Because the disorder primarily affected the nails and distal phalanges, the research group concluded that brachydactyly type B and Cooks syndrome are the same disorder.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Brachydactyly type B with its distinct facies and 'Cooks syndrome' are the same entity | author = de Ravel, T.

It was found that the two syndromes were distinct clinically, radiologically, and genetically.<ref name="Castori">{{cite journal | title = A novel patient with Cooks syndrome supports splitting from "classic" brachydactyly type B | author = Castori, M.; Brancati, F.; Mingarelli, R.; Mundlos, S.; Dallapiccola, B. | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics A | volume = 143 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–9 | date = 2007-01-15 | pmid = 17163524 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.31433}}</ref>
