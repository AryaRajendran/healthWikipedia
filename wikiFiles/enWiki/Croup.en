'''Croup''' (or '''laryngotracheobronchitis''') is a respiratory condition that is usually triggered by an acute viral infection of the upper airway.  The infection leads to swelling inside the throat, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classical symptoms of a "barking" [[cough]], [[stridor]], and [[hoarseness]]. It may produce mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, which often worsen at night. It is often treated with a single dose of oral [[steroids]]; occasionally [[epinephrine]] is used in more severe cases. Hospitalization is rarely required.

Croup is diagnosed on clinical grounds, once potentially more severe causes of symptoms have been excluded (i.e. [[epiglottitis]] or an [[airway foreign body]]). Further investigations—such as blood tests, [[X-rays]], and cultures—are usually not needed. It is a relatively common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point, most commonly between 6 months and 5–6 years of age.  It is almost never seen in teenagers or adults. Once due primarily to [[diphtheria]], this cause is now primarily of historical significance in the Western world due to the success of [[vaccination]], and improved hygiene and living standards.

Croup is characterized by a "barking" [[cough]], [[stridor]], [[hoarseness]], and [[Shortness of breath|difficult breathing]] which usually worsens at night.<ref name=Au10>{{cite journal | author = Rajapaksa S, Starr M | title = Croup – assessment and management | journal = Aust Fam Physician | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–2 | year = 2010 | month = May | pmid = 20485713 | doi =  }}</ref>  The "barking" cough is often described as resembling the call of a [[Pinniped|seal]] or [[sea lion]].<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>  The stridor is worsened by agitation or [[crying]], and if it can be heard at rest, it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways. As croup worsens, stridor may decrease considerably.<ref name=Au10/> 

Other symptoms include [[fever]], [[coryza]] (symptoms typical of the [[common cold]]), and [[chest wall]] indrawing.<ref name=Au10/><ref name=Alberta07>{{cite web |url=http://www.childhealthbc.ca/resources/category/5-croup?download=13%3Acroup-guideline |format=PDF|title=Diagnosis and Management of Croup |work=BC Children’s Hospital Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines |accessdate=}}</ref>  [[Drooling]] or a very sick appearance indicate other medical conditions.<ref name=Alberta07/>

==Causes==
Croup is usually deemed to be due to a viral infection.<ref name=Au10/><ref name=PedN09/> Others use the term more broadly, to include acute [[laryngotracheitis]], spasmodic croup, laryngeal diphtheria, [[bacterial tracheitis]], laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>

===Viral===
Viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is caused by [[parainfluenza virus]], primarily types 1 and 2, in 75% of cases.<ref name=Croup09/> Other viral etiologies include [[influenza]] A and B, [[measles]], [[adenovirus]] and [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV).<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/> Spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis, but lacks the usual signs of infection (such as fever, sore throat, and increased [[white blood cell count]]).<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>  Treatment, and response to treatment, are also similar.<ref name=Croup09/>

===Bacterial===
Bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>  Laryngeal diphtheria is due to ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' while bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth.  The most common bacteria implicated are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Hemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>

==Pathophysiology==
The viral infection that causes croup leads to swelling of the [[larynx]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and large [[bronchi]]<ref name=PedN09/> due to infiltration of [[white blood cells]] (especially [[histiocytes]], [[lymphocytes]], [[plasma cells]], and [[neutrophils]]).<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/> Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.<ref name=PedN09/>

Croup is a clinical diagnosis.<ref name=PedN09/>  The first step is to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially [[epiglottitis]], an airway [[foreign body]], [[subglottic stenosis]], [[angioedema]], [[retropharyngeal abscess]], and [[bacterial tracheitis]].<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/><ref name=PedN09/>

A frontal [[X-ray]] of the neck is not routinely performed,<ref name=PedN09/> but if it is done, it may show a characteristic narrowing of the trachea, called the [[steeple sign]], because of the subglottic stenosis, which is similar to a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in shape.  The steeple sign is suggestive of the diagnosis, but is absent in half of cases.<ref name=Alberta07/> 

Other investigations (such as [[blood test]]s and [[viral culture]]) are discouraged, as they may cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway.<ref name=PedN09/> While viral cultures, obtained via [[nasopharyngeal]] aspiration, can be used to confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings.<ref name=Au10/> Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>

;Severity

The most commonly used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM">{{cite journal | author = Cherry JD | title = Clinical practice. Croup | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 358 | issue = 4 | pages = 384–91 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18216359 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp072022 }}</ref> It is the sum of points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/> The points given for each factor is listed in the table to the right, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.<ref name=Peds99/>

* A total score of ≤&nbsp;2 indicates ''mild'' croup. The characteristic barking cough and hoarseness may be present, but there is no stridor at rest.<ref name=Croup09/>
* A total score of 3–5 is classified as ''moderate'' croup.  It presents with easily heard stridor, but with few other signs.<ref name=Croup09/>
* A total score of 6–11 is ''severe'' croup.  It also presents with obvious stridor, but also features marked [[chest wall]] indrawing.<ref name=Croup09/>
* A total score of ≥&nbsp;12 indicates impending [[respiratory failure]].  The barking cough and stridor may no longer be prominent at this stage.<ref name=Croup09/>

85% of children presenting to the emergency department have mild disease; severe croup is rare (<1%).<ref name=Croup09/>

==Prevention==
Many cases of croup have been prevented by [[immunization]] for [[influenza]] and [[diphtheria]]. At one time, croup referred to a diphtherial disease, but with vaccination, diphtheria is now rare in the developed world.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>

==Treatment==
Children with croup are generally kept as calm as possible.<ref name=PedN09/>  Steroids are given routinely, with [[epinephrine]] used in severe cases.<ref name=PedN09/> Children with [[oxygen saturation]]s under 92% should receive oxygen,<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/> and those with severe croup may be hospitalized for observation.<ref name=Alberta07/> If oxygen is needed, "blow-by" administration (holding an oxygen source near the child's face) is recommended, as it causes less agitation than use of a [[oxygen mask|mask]].<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/> With treatment, less than 0.2% of people require [[endotracheal intubation]].<ref name=Peds99>{{cite journal | author = Klassen TP | title = Croup.

===Steroids===
[[Corticosteroids]], such as [[dexamethasone]] and [[budesonide]], have been shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup.<ref name=Cochrane11>{{cite journal | author = Russell KF, Liang Y, O'Gorman K, Johnson DW, Klassen TP | title = Glucocorticoids for croup | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD001955 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21249651 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001955.pub3 }}</ref>  Significant relief is obtained as early as six hours after administration.<ref name=Cochrane11/>  While effective when given orally, [[parenteral]]ly, or by inhalation, the oral route is preferred.<ref name=PedN09/>  A single dose is usually all that is required, and is generally considered to be quite safe.<ref name=PedN09/> Dexamethasone at doses of  0.15, 0.3 and 0.6&nbsp;mg/kg appear to be all equally effective.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Port C | title = Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. BET 4. Dose of dexamethasone in croup | journal = Emerg Med J | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 291–2 | year = 2009 | month = April | pmid = 19307398 | doi = 10.1136/emj.2009.072090 }}</ref>

===Epinephrine===
Moderate to severe croup may be improved temporarily with [[nebulizer|nebulized]] [[epinephrine]].<ref name=PedN09>{{cite journal | author = Everard ML | title = Acute bronchiolitis and croup | journal = Pediatr. Clin. North Am. | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–33, x–xi | year = 2009 | month = February | pmid = 19135584 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2008.10.007 }}</ref> While epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours.<ref name=Au10/><ref name=PedN09/> If the condition remains improved for 2–4&nbsp;hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital.<ref name=Au10/><ref name=PedN09/>

===Other===
While other treatments for croup have been studied, none have sufficient evidence to support their use. Inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional [[self-care]] treatment, but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/><ref name=PedN09/> and currently it is rarely used.<ref name=Hist2001>{{cite journal | author = Marchessault V | title = Historical review of croup | journal = Can J Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 337–9 | year = 2001 | month = November | pmid = 18159359 | pmc = 2094841 | doi =  }}</ref> The use of [[cough medicine]]s, which usually contain [[dextromethorphan]] and/or [[guiafenesin]], are also discouraged.<ref name=Au10/> While breathing [[heliox]] (a mixture of [[helium]] and [[oxygen]]) to decrease the work of breathing has been used in the past, there is very little evidence to support its use.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vorwerk C, Coats T | title = Heliox for croup in children | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = CD006822 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20166089 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub2 }}</ref>  Since croup is usually a viral disease, [[antibiotics]] are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected.<ref name=Au10/> In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics [[vancomycin]] and [[cefotaxime]] are recommended.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/> In severe cases associated with influenza&nbsp;A or B, the [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] [[neuraminidase inhibitors]] may be administered.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>

==Prognosis==
Viral croup is usually a [[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limited]] disease, but can very rarely result in death from [[respiratory failure]] and/or [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=Au10/>  Symptoms usually improve within two&nbsp;days, but may last for up to seven&nbsp;days.<ref name=Croup09/> Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis, [[pneumonia]], and [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name=Croup09>{{cite journal | author = Johnson D | title = Croup | journal = Clin Evid (Online) | volume = 2009 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2009 | pmid = 19445760 | pmc = 2907784 | doi =  }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Croup affects about 15% of children, and usually presents between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/><ref name=PedN09/> It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population.<ref name=Croup09/> In rare cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years.<ref name=Croup09/> Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased [[prevalence]] in autumn.<ref name="Cherry08_NEJM"/>

==History==
The word ''croup'' comes from the [[Early Modern English]] verb ''croup'', meaning "to cry hoarsely"; the name was first applied to the disease in Scotland and popularized in the 18th century.<ref>Online Etymological Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=croup croup]. Accessed 2010-09-13.</ref> Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of [[Homer]]'s [[Ancient Greece]] and it was not until 1826 that viral croup was differentiated from croup due to [[diphtheria]] by Bretonneau.<ref name=history>{{cite book |author=Feigin, Ralph D. |title=Textbook of pediatric infectious diseases |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2004 |page=252 |isbn=0-7216-9329-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Viral croup was then called "faux-croup" by the French, as "croup" then referred to a disease caused by the diphtheria bacteria.<ref name=Hist2001/>  Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown due to the advent of effective [[immunization]].<ref name=history/>
