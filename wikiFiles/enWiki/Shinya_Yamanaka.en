{{nihongo|'''Shinya Yamanaka'''|山中 伸弥|Yamanaka Shin'ya|born September 4, 1962}} is a Japanese physician and researcher of adult [[stem cell]]s.<ref name="stem1"/><ref name="stem2"/><ref name="stem3"/> He serves as the director of Center for iPS Cell Research and Application and a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at [[Kyoto University]]; as a senior investigator at the UCSF-affiliated [[J. David Gladstone Institutes]] in San Francisco, California; and as a professor of anatomy at [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF). Yamanaka is also the current president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR).

He received the [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]] in 2011 with [[Rudolf Jaenisch]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wolffund.org.il/index.php?dir=site&page=winners&cs=275|title=Shinya Yamanaka Winner of Wolf Prize in Medicine – 2011|publisher=Wolf Foundation}}</ref> the [[Millennium Technology Prize]] in 2012 together with [[Linus Torvalds]]. In 2012 he and [[John Gurdon]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=8 October 2012|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – 2012 Press Release}}</ref> In 2013 he was awarded the $3 million [[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]] for his work.

== Education ==
Yamanaka was born in [[Higashiōsaka, Osaka|Higashiōsaka]]. After graduating from Tennōji High School attached to [[Osaka Kyoiku University]],<ref>http://english.kyodonews.jp/photos/2012/10/186903.html</ref> he received his M.D. at [[Kobe University]] in 1987 and his PhD at [[Osaka City University#Graduate schools|Osaka City University Graduate School]] in 1993. After this, he went through a residency in orthopedic surgery at National Osaka Hospital and a [[postdoctoral]] fellowship at the Gladstone Institute of [[Cardiovascular Disease]], San Francisco.

== Professional career ==
Between 1987 and 1989, Yamanaka was a [[residency (medicine)|resident]] in orthopedic surgery at the National Osaka Hospital. His first operation, was removing a benign tumor from his friend Shuichi Hirata, a task he could not complete after one hour, when a skilled surgeon would take ten minutes or so. Some [[Senpai and kōhai|seniors]] referred to him as "Jamanaka", a pun on the Japanese word for obstacle.<ref name="ajw.asahi.com">[[Asahi Shimbun]] [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201210090063 After failure as a surgeon, Yamanaka rises to stem cell glory October 9, 2012]</ref>

From 1993 to 1996, he was at the [[Gladstone Institutes|Gladstone Institute]] of Cardiovascular Disease, which is affiliated with the [[University of California, San Francisco]], where there was an atmosphere of freedom and the ability to speak frankly with colleagues.  Between 1996 and 1999, he was an assistant professor at Osaka City University Medical School, but found himself mostly looking after mice in the laboratory, not doing actual research.<ref name="ajw.asahi.com"/>

His wife advised him to become a practicing doctor, but instead he applied for a position at the [[Nara Institute of Science and Technology]]. He stated that he could and would clarify the characteristics of embryonic stem cells, and this can-do attitude won him the job. From 1999–2003, he was an [[associate professor]] there, and started the research that would later win him the 2012 Nobel Prize. He became a full professor and remained at the institute in that position from 2003–2005. Between 2004 and 2010, Yamanaka was a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080210081040/http://www.frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rc02/kyojuE.html| archivedate= February 10, 2008| url= http://www.frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rc02/kyojuE.html |title=Shinya Yamanaka MD., PhD|work=Kyoto University}}</ref> Currently, Yamanaka is the director and a professor at the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at [[Kyoto University]].

In 2006, he and his team generated [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPS cells) from adult mouse [[fibroblast]]s.<ref name="stem1"/> iPS cells closely resemble [[embryonic stem cell]]s, the ''in vitro'' equivalent of the part of the [[blastocyst]] (the embryo a few days after fertilization) which grows to become the embryo proper. They could show that his iPS cells were [[pluripotent]], i.e. capable of generating all cell lineages of the body, and were soon after capable of generating mice from iPS cells.<ref name="stem3"/> Later he and his team generated iPS cells from human adult fibroblasts,<ref name="stem2"/> again as the first group to do so.
A key difference from previous attempts by the field was his team's use of multiple [[transcription factor]]s, instead of [[transfection|transfecting]] one transcription factor per experiment<!-- from lecture by José Silva -->. They started with 24 transcription factors known to be important in the early embryo, but could in the end reduce it to 4 transcription factors – [[Sox2]], [[Oct4]], [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]].<ref name="stem1"/>

==Interest in sports==
Yamanaka practiced judo (2dan black belt) and played rugby as a university student. He also has a history of running marathons. After a 20-year gap, he competed in the inaugural [[Osaka Marathon]] in 2011 as a charity runner with a time of 4:29:53. He also took part in the 2012 Kyoto Marathon to raise money for iPS research, finishing in 4:03:19. He also ran in the second Osaka Marathon on November 25, 2012.<ref>[[Daily Yomiuri]] [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121009002976.htm Yamanaka avid lifelong athlete / Nobel laureate gave same dedication to sports as he has to science October 10, 2012]</ref>

== Recognition ==
In 2007, Yamanaka was recognized as a "Person Who Mattered" in the [[Time Person of the Year]] edition of ''[[Time Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1690753_1690758_1693587,00.html|title=Junying Yu, James Thomson and Shinya Yamanaka | work=Time | date=December 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Yamanaka was also nominated as a 2008 [[Time 100]] Finalist.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1725112_1723512_1723571,00.html|title=Shinya Yamanaka – The 2008 Time 100 Finalists | date=April 1, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> In June 2010, Yamanaka was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize]] for reprogramming adult skin cells to pluripotential precursors. Yamanaka developed the method as an alternative to embryonic stem cells, thus circumventing an approach in which embryos would be destroyed.

In September 2010, he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] for his work on biology and stem cells.<ref>[http://www.balzan.org/news-it/i-vincitori-dei-premi-balzan-2010_5154.html Balzan Prize winners in 2010], from the website of the ''Fondazione internazionale Premio Balzan''</ref>

Yamanaka has been listed as one of the 15 Asian Scientists To Watch by ''[[Asian Scientist]]'' magazine on May 15, 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Ultimate List Of 15 Asian Scientists To Watch – Shinya Yamanaka|url=http://www.asianscientist.com/list/shinya-yamanaka//|date=May 15, 2011 |work= AsianScientist.com |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/stemcells.2007.9}}</ref> In June 2011, he was awarded the inaugural [[McEwen Award for Innovation]]; he shared the $100,000 prize with [[Kazutoshi Takahashi]], who was the lead author on the paper describing the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.<ref>{{cite web | title= McEwen Award for Innovation | url= http://www.isscr.org/McEwen_Award_for_Innovation/5323.htm| publisher= [[ISSCR]] |accessdate= 2012-10-09}}</ref>

In June 2012, he was awarded the [[Millennium Technology Prize]] for his work in stem cells.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18425039 Stem cell scientist wins millennium technology prize]. BBC.co.uk (June 13, 2012). Retrieved on 2012-10-08.</ref> He shared the 1.2 million euro prize with [[Linus Torvalds]], the creator of the Linux operating system.

===Nobel Prize===
In October 2012, he and fellow stem cell researcher [[John Gurdon]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] ''"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent."''<ref name="NobelPrize">{{cite web | url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012 | publisher=NobelPrize.org | date=October 8, 2012 | accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref>
