'''Vaccination''' is the administration of [[antigen]]ic material (a [[vaccine]]) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive]] [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a [[pathogen]].

The active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated (non-infective) or attenuated (with reduced infectivity) forms of the causative [[pathogen]]s, or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic (e.g., outer coat [[protein]]s of a [[virus]]). [[Toxoids]] are produced for immunization against [[toxin]]-based diseases, such as the modification of [[tetanospasmin]] toxin of [[tetanus]] to remove its toxic effect but retain its [[immunogenic]] effect.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf</ref>

In common speech, 'vaccination' and 'immunization' have a similar meaning. This distinguishes it from [[inoculation]], which uses unweakened live pathogens, although in common usage either is used to refer to an [[immunization]]. Vaccination efforts have been met with some [[Vaccine controversy|controversy]] since their inception, on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, and religious grounds. In rare cases, vaccinations can injure people and, in the United States, they may receive compensation for those injuries under the [[National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]]. Early success and [[Vaccination Act|compulsion]] brought widespread acceptance, and mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of many diseases in numerous geographic regions.

==Mechanism of function==
Generically, the process of [[artificial induction of immunity]], in an effort to protect against [[infectious disease]], works by 'priming' the [[immune system]] with an '[[immunogen]]'.  Stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent is known as ''[[immunization]]''.  Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens.
[[File:Polio vaccination in Sweden 1957.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polio]] vaccination started in Sweden in 1957.]]
Some vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease. Vaccinia given after exposure to smallpox, within the first three days, is reported to attenuate the disease considerably, and vaccination up to a week after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease.<ref name=CDCvac>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |format=PDF|title=Vaccine Overview |accessdate=2008-01-02 |work=Smallpox Fact Sheet}}</ref>  The first [[rabies]] immunization was given by [[Louis Pasteur]] to a child after he was bitten by a rabid dog. Subsequent to this, it has been found that, in people with uncompromised immune systems, four doses of rabies vaccine over 14 days, wound care, and treatment of the bite with rabies [[Antibody|immune globulin]], commenced as soon as possible after exposure, is effective in preventing the development of rabies in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rupprecht CE, Briggs D, Brown CM, ''et al.'' |title=Use of a reduced (4-dose) vaccine schedule for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=59 |issue=RR–2 |pages=1–9 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20300058 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Other examples include experimental [[AIDS]], [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]] vaccines. Such immunizations aim to trigger an immune response more rapidly and with less harm than natural infection.

Most vaccines are given by hypodermic injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the [[intestines]]. Live attenuated polio, some typhoid and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel.

===Adjuvants and preservatives===
Vaccines typically contain one or more [[adjuvant]]s, used to boost the immune response. Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto [[alum]]. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who get an excessive reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when time for a booster occurs.

In the preparation for the 1990 Gulf campaign, Pertussis vaccine (not acellular) was used as an adjuvant for Anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the Anthrax, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.

Vaccines may also contain preservatives to prevent contamination with [[bacteria]] or [[fungi]]. Until recent years, the preservative [[thiomersal]] was used in many vaccines that did not contain live virus. As of 2005, the only childhood vaccine in the U.S. that contains thiomersal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine,[http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/thi-table.htm] which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors.<ref>Melinda Wharton. National Vaccine Advisory committee [http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/vacc_plan/ U.S.A. national vaccine plan]</ref> Single-dose Influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list Thiomersal (its UK name) in the ingredients. Preservatives may be used at various stages of production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.<ref>[http://www.npl.co.uk/environment/vam/nongaseouspollutants/ngp_metals.html]</ref>{{dead link|date=September 2012}}

===Vaccination versus inoculation===
Many times these words are used interchangeably, as if they were synonyms. In fact, they are different things. As doctor Byron Plant explains: "Vaccination is the more commonly used term, which actually consists of a "safe" injection of a sample taken from a cow suffering from cowpox... Inoculation, a practice probably as old as the disease itself, is the injection of the variola virus taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox sufferer into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly on the upper arm of the subject. Often inoculation was done "arm to arm" or less effectively "scab to arm"...<ref>[http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/doctors/diff.html "Doctors and diagnosis" ''The difference between Vaccination and Inoculation'']</ref>

Vaccination began in the 18th century with the work of [[Edward Jenner]].<ref>"Edward Jenner - (1749–1823)". Sundaytimes.lk. 2008-06-01. http://sundaytimes.lk/080601/FunDay/famous.html. Retrieved 2009-07-28.</ref><ref>"History - Edward Jenner (1749 - 1823)". BBC. 2006-11-01. http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jenner_edward.shtml.

==Types==<!-- This section is linked from [[MMR vaccine]] -->

Vaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response, but there are several ways to do this.  Four main types are currently in clinical use:
#An [[inactivated vaccine]] consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde. Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate, the virus [[capsid]] proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response.  When manufactured correctly, the vaccine is not infectious, but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles.  Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce, [[booster dose|booster]] shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response.
#In an [[attenuated vaccine]], live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered.  They will replicate, but locally or very slowly.  Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often.  These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence.  There is a small risk of reversion to [[virulent|virulence]], which is smaller in vaccines with deletions.  Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by [[immunocompromised]] individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens ([[infectious bursal disease virus]], [[avian infectious bronchitis virus]], avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus [http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf], avian metapneumovirus [http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.15_TURKEY_RHINO.pdf])<ref>Diseases of Poultry, 11th ed. Y. M. Saif et al., editors. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA, 2003.</ref>
#[[Virus-like particle]] vaccines consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. These proteins can self-assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid, meaning that they are not infectious. Because of their highly repetitive, multivalent structure, virus-like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines (described below).  The [[human papillomavirus]] and [[Hepatitis B virus]] vaccines are two virus-like particle-based vaccines currently in clinical use.
#A [[subunit vaccine]] presents an antigen to the immune system without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise.  One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a bacterial toxin) and administering this by itself.  A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism.  In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.

A number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation.  These include [[DNA vaccination]] and recombinant viral vectors.

==History==
===In written history===
[[File:Edward Jenner manuscript.jpg|thumb|Jenner's handwritten draft of the first vaccination.]]
It is believed likely that some form of inoculation was developed in India or China before the 16th century.<ref name="pmid17633292"/> Scholar Ole Lund comments: "The earliest documented examples of vaccination are from [[India]] and [[China]] in the 17th century, where vaccination with powdered scabs from people infected with [[smallpox]] was used to protect against the disease. Smallpox used to be a common disease throughout the world and 20% to 30% of infected persons died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for 8% to 20% of all deaths in several European countries in the 18th century. The tradition of inoculation may have originated in India in 1000 BCE."<ref>Lund, Ole; Nielsen, Morten Strunge and Lundegaard, Claus (2005). ''Immunological Bioinformatics''. MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-12280-4</ref> The mention of inoculation in the ''Sact'eya Grantham'', an [[Ayurvedic]] text, was noted by the French scholar Henri Marie Husson in the journal ''Dictionaire des sciences médicales''.<ref>Chaumeton, F.P.; F.V. Me`rat de Vaumartoise. ''Dictionaire des sciences sciences médicales''. Paris: C.L.F. Panckoucke, 1812-1822, lvi (1821).</ref> [[Almroth Wright]], the professor of pathology at [[Netley]], further helped shape the future of vaccination by conducting limited experiments on the professional staff at Netly, including himself. The outcome of these experiments resulted in further development of vaccination in Europe.<ref>Curtin, Phillip (1998). "Disease and Empire: The Health of European Troops in the Conquest of Africa". Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-59835-4</ref> The Anatolian Ottoman Turks knew about methods of inoculation. This kind of inoculation and other forms of variolation were introduced into England by [[Mary Wortley Montagu|Lady Montagu]], a famous English letter-writer and wife of the English ambassador at Istanbul between 1716 and 1718, who almost died from smallpox as a young adult and was physically scarred from it.  She came across the Turkish methods of inoculation, consenting to have her son inoculated by the Embassy surgeon Charles Maitland in the Turkish way.  Lady Montagu wrote to her sister and friends in England describing the process in details.  On her return to England she continued to propagate the Turkish tradition of inoculation and had many of her relatives inoculated.  The breakthrough came when a scientific description of the inoculation operation was submitted to the Royal Society in 1724 by Dr Emmanual Timoni, who had been the Montagu's family physician in Istanbul. Inoculation was adopted both in England and in France nearly half a century before [[Edward Jenner|Jenner]]'s famous smallpox vaccine of 1796.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anthony Henricy (ed.)|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady Mary Wortley Montagu:Written During her Travels in Europe, Asia and Africa |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=167–169 |year=1796}}</ref>

Since then vaccination campaigns have spread throughout the globe, sometimes prescribed by law or regulations (See [[Vaccination Act]]s). Vaccines are now used against a wide variety of diseases besides [[smallpox]].  [[Louis Pasteur]] further developed the technique during the 19th century, extending its use to killed agents protecting against [[anthrax disease|anthrax]] and [[rabies]].  The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect, whereas inoculation was the hopeful selection of a less virulent form of the disease, and Jenner's vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease for the one protected against.  Pasteur adopted the name ''vaccine'' as a generic term in honor of Jenner's discovery.
[[File:Typhoid inoculation2.jpg|left|thumb|A doctor performing a [[typhoid]] vaccination in [[Texas]], 1943.]]
Prior to vaccination with cowpox, the only known protection against smallpox was ''[[inoculation]]'' or ''variolation'' (Variola - the Smallpox viruses) where a small amount of live smallpox virus was administered to the patient; this carried the serious risk that the patient would be killed or seriously ill.  The death rate from variolation was reported to be around a tenth of that from natural infection with Variola, and the immunity provided was considered quite reliable. Factors contributing to the efficacy of variolation probably include the choices of Variola Minor strains used, the relatively low number of cells infected in the first phase of multiplication following initial exposure, and the exposure route used, via the skin or nasal lining rather than inhalation of droplets into the lungs.

Consistency would suggest the activity should have predated Jenner's description of an effective vaccination system, and there is some history relating to opposition to the older and more hazardous procedure of variolation.<ref name="Wolfe2002">{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Robert M|coauthors=Sharp, Lisa K|date=24 August 2002|title=Anti-vaccinationists past and present|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|location=London|page=325|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf|volume=325|issue=7361|pmid=12193361|pmc=1123944}}</ref>
In modern times, the first vaccine-preventable disease targeted for eradication was smallpox.  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) coordinated the global effort to eradicate this disease.  The last naturally occurring case of smallpox occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1977.

[[Maurice Hilleman]] was the most prolific of inventors of vaccines. He developed successful vaccines for [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[chickenpox]], [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' bacteria.<ref name=Vaccinated>{{cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 }}</ref>

In 1988, the governing body of WHO targeted [[Polio eradication|polio for eradication]] by 2000.  Although the target was missed, eradication is very close.  The next eradication target would most likely be [[measles]], which has declined since the introduction of measles vaccination in 1963.

In 2000, the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] was established to strengthen routine vaccinations and introduce new and under-used vaccines in countries with a per capita GDP of under US$1000.  GAVI is now entering its second phase of funding, which extends through 2014.

{{Main|Vaccination policy}}
{{Further|Vaccine controversy|Vaccine injury}}

In an attempt to eliminate the risk of outbreaks of some diseases, at various times several governments and other institutions have instituted policies requiring vaccination for all people.  For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in [[England]] and [[Wales]], with fines levied on people who did not comply.  Common contemporary U.S. vaccination policies require that children receive common vaccinations before entering public school.

Beginning with early vaccination in the nineteenth century, these policies were resisted by a variety of groups, collectively called [[anti-vaccinationist]]s, who object on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, [[vaccination and religion|religious]], and other grounds. Common objections are that vaccinations do not work, that compulsory vaccination represents excessive government intervention in personal matters, or that the proposed vaccinations are not sufficiently safe.<ref name=wolfesharp>{{cite journal |author= Wolfe R, Sharp L |title= Anti-vaccinationists past and present |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7361 |pages=430–2 |year=2002 |pmid=12193361 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/325/7361/430 |pmc= 1123944}}</ref> Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people who have compromised immune systems, allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Salmon DA, Teret SP, MacIntyre CR, Salisbury D, Burgess MA, Halsey NA |title= Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9508 |pages=436–42 |year=2006 |pmid=16458770 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68144-0}}</ref>

One of the most noteworthy allegations of vaccine-induced injury is the [[MMR vaccine controversy]].
