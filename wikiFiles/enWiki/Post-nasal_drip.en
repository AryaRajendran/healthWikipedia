'''Post-nasal drip''' ('''PND'''), also known as '''upper airway cough syndrome''' ('''UACS'''), occurs when excessive [[mucus]] is produced by the nasal [[mucosa]]. The excess mucus accumulates in the [[Nasopharynx|throat]] or back of the [[Human nose|nose]]. It is caused by [[rhinitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD), or by a disorder of swallowing (such as an [[esophageal motility disorder]]). It is frequently caused by an [[allergy]], which may be seasonal or persistent throughout the year.

==Associated conditions==
PND is known to be a cause of [[halitosis]], especially when a sinus infection is also present. [[Acid reflux]] or [[heartburn]] is believed to aggravate and in some cases cause post-nasal drip.<ref name=Rosenberg1996>{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=M|title=Clinical assessment of bad breath: current concepts|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=127|issue=4|pages=475â€“82|year=1996|pmid=8655868|doi=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Individuals may be diagnosed as suffering from post-nasal drip if they suffer from the following symptoms:
*[[Coughing]];
*[[Wheezing]] (a more common source of wheezing than asthma);
*Constant [[swallowing]];
*[[Rhinorrhea]], running nose due to mucus flow;
*Frequent [[spitting]];
*Tickling in the throat;
*Constant clearing of throat;
*Rigid burning sensation at back of the throat;
*Broken or cracking voice;
*Mucus feeling in the back of the throat;
*[[Dyspnea|Difficulty in breathing]];
*Congestion in the nasal and [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] passages;
*[[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] [[sore throat]];
*Masses formed in the crypts of the [[tonsil]]s that are generally yellow or white (commonly called tonsil stones, or [[tonsillolith]]s);
*[[Halitosis]] (bad breath);
*Snorting to clear mucus from the nasal passage that cannot otherwise be cleared by blowing one's nose;
*Cobblestone appearance of the [[oropharyngeal mucosa]];
*Frontal cranial pressure;
*[[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]];
*[[Nausea]];
*[[Vomiting]].

==Treatment==
First and foremost, as the causes are manifold, a removal of those causes should be targeted. Treatment may include [[antibiotics]], [[decongestants]], [[nasal irrigation]], sinus massage, acid control medication, allergy medication, and minor [[surgery]]. Bulb syringes, squirt bottles, pulsatile nasal irrigators or neti pots are often used for [[nasal irrigation]]. Allergy medications include [[antihistamine]]s, [[decongestant]]s, nasal steroids alone or in combination. Allergy injections may be used for long-term relief when allergy is the cause. Oral steroids may be prescribed for short-term use in some situations.
