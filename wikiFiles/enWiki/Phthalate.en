'''Phthalates''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|æ|,|l|eɪ|t|s}}, {{respell|THA|layts}} <ref>"{{YouTube|id=QH5PbE8wwMY|title=ACC Addresses Phthalates Safety"}}: video of Steve Risotto of the American Chemistry Council, uploaded by user AmericanChemistry on 23 Oct 2009, retrieved 23 Dec 2011.</ref>), or '''phthalate esters''', are [[esters]] of [[phthalic acid]] and are mainly used as [[plasticizer]]s (substances added to [[plastic]]s to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity).  They are used primarily to soften [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). Phthalates are being phased out of many products in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[European Union]] over health concerns.

Phthalates are used in a large variety of products, from [[enteric coating]]s of pharmaceutical tablets and nutritional supplements to [[viscosity]] control agents, gelling agents, film formers, [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]]s, [[dispersant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, binders, [[emulsifying agents]], and suspending agents. End-applications include adhesives and glues, electronics, agricultural adjuvants, building materials, personal-care products, medical devices, detergents and [[surfactants]], packaging, children's toys, [[modeling clay]], waxes, [[paints]], printing inks and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, and textiles.

Phthalates are easily released into the environment because there is no [[covalent bond]] between the phthalates and [[plastic]]s in which they are mixed. As plastics age and break down, the release of phthalates accelerates. People are commonly exposed to phthalates, and most Americans tested by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have [[metabolite]]s of multiple phthalates in their urine. Because phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bound to PVC, they can easily leach and evaporate into food or the atmosphere. Phthalate exposure can be through direct use or by indirect means through leaching and general environmental contamination. [[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] is believed to be the main source of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and other phthalates in the general population. Fatty foods such as milk, butter, and meats are a major source. 

In studies of rodents exposed to certain phthalates, high doses have been shown to change hormone levels and cause birth defects.<ref name=CDC/>

==Uses==
Phthalates are used in a large variety of products, from [[enteric coating]]s of pharmaceutical pills and nutritional supplements to [[viscosity]] control agents, gelling agents, film formers, [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]]s, [[dispersant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, binders, [[emulsifying agents]], and suspending agents. End-applications include  adhesives and glues, agricultural adjuvants, building materials, personal-care products, medical devices, detergents and [[surfactants]], packaging, children's toys, [[modelling clay]], waxes, [[paints]], printing inks and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, and textiles. Phthalates are also frequently used in soft plastic fishing lures, [[caulk]], [[paint]] pigments, and [[sex toys]] made of so-called "jelly rubber". Phthalates are used in a variety of household applications such as shower curtains, vinyl upholstery, adhesives, floor tiles, food containers and wrappers, and cleaning materials. Personal-care items containing phthalates include perfume, eye shadow, moisturizer, nail polish, liquid soap, and hair spray.<ref name=endo>{{cite journal |author=Rudel R, Perovich L |title=Endocrine disrupting chemicals in indoor and outdoor air |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=170–81 |month=January |pmid=20047015 |year=2008 |pmc=2677823 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.09.025 }}</ref> 
They are also found in modern electronics and medical applications such as catheters and blood transfusion devices. The most widely used phthalates are the [[di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]] (DEHP), the [[diisodecyl phthalate]] (DIDP), and the [[diisononyl phthalate]] (DINP). DEHP is the dominant plasticizer used in [[PVC]] due to its low cost. [[Benzylbutylphthalate]] (BBP) is used in the manufacture of foamed PVC, which is mostly used as a flooring material. Phthalates with small R and R' groups are used as [[solvent]]s in [[perfume]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

Globally, approximately six million tonnes of plasticizers are consumed every year, of which European consumption accounts for approximately 1 million tonnes. They contribute 10-60% of plastic products by weight.<ref name=endo/> More recently in Europe, regulatory developments have resulted in a change in phthalate consumption, with the higher phthalates (DINP and DIDP) replacing DEHP as the plasticizer of choice because DIDP and DIP are not classified as hazardous. DEHP, although most applications are shown to pose no risk when studied using recognsied methods of risk assessment, has been classified as a Category 1A reprotoxin and is now on the Annex XIV of the EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) legislation which means that producers and users will need to submit authorisation requests to the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to continue to use DEHP. Analysis of such applications will involve studies on alternatives and, given the wide number of compounds that have been used as plasticizers, such evaluations are likely to be far reaching.

==History==
The development of [[cellulose nitrate]] in 1846 led to the patent of [[castor oil]] in 1856 for use as the first plasticizer. In 1870, [[camphor]] became the more favored plasticizer for cellulose nitrate. Phthalates were first introduced in the 1920s and quickly replaced the volatile and odorous camphor. In 1931, the commercial availability of polyvinyl chloride and the development of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate began the boom of the plasticizer [[PVC]] industry.

== Properties ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
Phthalate [[ester]]s are the di[[alkyl]] or alkyl [[aryl]] esters of [[phthalic acid]] (also called 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, not be confused with the [[Structural isomer#Position isomerism|structurally]] [[Phthalic acid#Isomers|isomeric]] [[terephthalic acid|terephthalic]] or [[Isophthalic acid|isophthalic]] acids ); the name ''phthalate'' derives from [[phthalic acid]], which itself is derived from word "[[naphthalene]]". When added to plastics, phthalates allow the long polyvinyl molecules to slide against one another. The phthalates have a clear syrupy liquid consistency and show low water solubility, high oil solubility, and low volatility. The polar [[carboxyl]] group contributes little to the physical properties of the phthalates, except when R and R' are very small (such as ethyl or methyl groups). They are colorless, odorless liquids produced by reacting [[phthalic anhydride]] with an appropriate [[alcohol]] (usually 6- to 13-carbon).

The mechanism by which phthalates and other molecules afford plasticisation to polar polymers has been a subject of intense study since the 1960s. The mechanism is one of a polar interactions between the polar centres of the phthalate molecule (the C=O functionality) and the positively charged areas of the vinyl chain, typically residing on the carbon atom of the carbon-chlorine bond. In order for this to be established, the polymer needs to be heated in the presence of the plasticizer, first above the [[glass transition temperature|Tg]] of the polymer and then into a melt state. This enables an intimate mix of polymer and plasticizer to be formed, and for these interactions to occur. When cooled, these interactions remain and the network of PVC chains cannot reform (as is present in unplasticised PVC, or PVC-U). The alkyl chains of the phthalate then screen the PVC chains from each other as well. This explains why small changes in the length of these chains produce small changes in the level of plasticisation.

==Health effects==

===Exposure===
Phthalates are easily released into the environment because there is no [[covalent bond]] between the phthalates and [[plastic]]s in which they are mixed. As plastics age and break down, the release of phthalates accelerates. Phthalates in the environment are subject to [[biodegradation]], [[photodegradation]], and anaerobic degradation; therefore, in general, they do not persist in the outdoor environment. Outdoor air concentrations are higher in [[city|urban]] and [[suburb]]an areas than in [[Rural area|rural]] and remote areas.<ref name=endo/> 

In general, indoor air concentrations are higher than outdoor air concentrations due to the nature of the sources. Because of their [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]], [[Diethyl phthalate|DEP]] and [[Dimethyl phthalate|DMP]] are present in higher concentrations in air in comparison with the heavier and less volatile [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|DEHP]]. Higher air temperatures result in higher concentrations of phthalates in the air. [[PVC]] flooring leads to higher concentrations of [[Butyl benzyl phthalate|BBP]] and DEHP, which are more prevalent in dust.<ref name=endo/><ref>http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=120485&CultureCode=en</ref>  A 2012 Swedish study of children found that phthalates from PVC flooring was taken up into their bodies, showing that children can ingest phthalates not only from food but also by breathing and through the skin.<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120523102142.htm</ref>  

People are commonly exposed to phthalates, and most people in the US tested by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have [[metabolite]]s of multiple phthalates in their urine. Recent human [[biomonitoring]] data shows that the tolerable intake of children is exceeded to a considerable degree, in some instances up to 20-fold.  Because phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bound to PVC, they can easily leach and evaporate into food or the atmosphere. Phthalate exposure can be through direct use or by indirect means through leaching and general environmental contamination. [[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] is believed to be the main source of DEHP and other phthalates in the general population. Fatty foods such as milk, butter, and meats are a major source. Low-molecular-weight phthalates such as DEP, DBP, [[BBzP]] may be dermally absorbed. Inhalational exposure is also significant with the more volatile phthalates.<ref name=phthalates>{{cite journal |author=Heudorf U, Mersch-Sundermann V, Angerer J |title=Phthalates: toxicology and exposure |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=210 |issue=5 |pages=623–34 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17889607 |doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2007.07.011 }}</ref> 

In a 2008 Bulgarian study, higher dust concentrations of DEHP were found in homes of children with asthma and allergies, compared with healthy children's homes.<ref name=dust>{{cite journal |author=Kolarik B, Bornehag C, Naydenov K, Sundell J, Stavova P, Nielsen O |title=The concentration of phthalates in settled dust in Bulgarian homes in relation to building characteristic and cleaning habits in the family |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=42 |issue=37 |pages=8553–9 |month=December |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.08.028 }}</ref> The author of the study stated, "The concentration of DEHP was found to be significantly associated with wheezing in the last 12 months as reported by the parents."<ref name=dust /> Phthalates were found in almost every sampled home in Bulgaria. The same study found that DEHP, BBzP, and DnOP were in significantly higher concentrations in dust samples collected in homes where polishing agents were used. Data on flooring materials was collected, but there was not a significant difference in concentrations between homes where no polish was used that have balatum (PVC or linoleum) flooring and homes with wood. High frequency of dusting did decrease the concentration.<ref name=dust />

In general, children's exposure to phthalates is greater than that of adults. In a 1990s Canadian study that modeled ambient exposures, it was estimated that daily exposure to DEHP was 9&nbsp;μg / kg bodyweight / day in infants, 19&nbsp;μg / kg bodyweight / day in toddlers, 14&nbsp;μg / kg bodyweight / day in children, and 6&nbsp;μg / kg bodyweight/day in adults.<ref name=phthalates/> Infants and toddlers are at the greatest risk of exposure, because of their mouthing behavior. Body-care products containing phthalates are a source of exposure for infants. The authors of a 2008 study "observed that reported use of infant lotion, infant powder, and infant shampoo were associated with increased infant urine concentrations of [phthalate metabolites], and this association is strongest in younger infants. These findings suggest that dermal exposures may contribute significantly to phthalate body burden in this population." Though they did not examine health outcomes, they noted that "Young infants are more vulnerable to the potential adverse effects of phthalates given their increased dosage per unit body surface area, metabolic capabilities, and developing endocrine and reproductive systems."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sathyanarayana S, Karr CJ, Lozano P, ''et al.'' |title=Baby care products: possible sources of infant phthalate exposure |journal=Pediatrics |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=e260–8 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18245401 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-3766 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/2/e260}}</ref> 

Infants and hospitalized children are particularly susceptible to phthalate exposure. Medical devices and tubing may contain 20-40% Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) by weight, which "easily leach out of tubing when heated (as with warm saline/blood) ".<ref name="Sathyanarayana">Sathyanarayana, S.  (2008)  Phthalates and children's health. Current Problems In Adolescent Health Care, 38, 34-39. {{doi|10.1016/j.cppeds.2007.11.001}}</ref> Several medical devices contain phthalates including, but not limited to, IV tubing, gloves, nasogastric tubes and respiratory tubing.  The Food and Drug Administration did an extensive risk assessment of phthalates in the medical setting and found that neonates may be exposed to five times greater than the allowed daily tolerable intake. This finding led to the conclusion by the  FDA that, "Children undergoing certain medical procedures may represent a population at increased risk for the effects of DEHP."  <ref name="Sathyanarayana" />

In 2008, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found a variety of phthalates in [[eraser]]s and warned of health risks when children regularly suck and chew on them. The European Commission [[Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks]] (SCHER), however, considers that, even in the case when children bite off pieces from erasers and swallow them, it is unlikely that this exposure leads to health consequences.<ref>{{cite web | title=Phthalates in school supplies| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2009-06-10 | url= http://copublications.greenfacts.org/en/phthalates-school-supplies/}}</ref>

Phthalates are also found in medications, where they are used as inactive ingredients in producing [[enteric coating]]s. It is not known how many medications are made using phthalates, but some include [[omeprazole]], [[didanosine]], [[mesalamine]], and [[theophylline]]. A recent study found that urinary concentrations of monobutyl phthalate, the DBP metabolite, of Asacol (a particular formulation of mesalamine) users was 50 times higher than the mean of nonusers.<ref name=meds/> The study showed that exposures from phthalate-containing medications can far exceed population levels from other sources.<ref name=meds>{{cite journal |author=Hernández-Díaz S, Mitchell AA, Kelley KE, Calafat AM, Hauser R |title=Medications as a Potential Source of Exposure to Phthalates in the U.S. Population |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=185–9 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19270786 |pmc=2649218 |doi=10.1289/ehp.11766 }}
</ref> DBP in medications raises concern about health risks due to the high level of exposures associated with taking these medications, especially in vulnerable segments of the population, including pregnant women and children.<ref name=meds/>

In 2008, the [[United States National Research Council]] recommended that the cumulative effects of phthalates and other [[antiandrogens]] be investigated. It criticized US EPA guidances, which stipulate that, when examining cumulative effects, the chemicals examined should have similar mechanisms of action or similar structures, as too restrictive. It recommended instead that the effects of chemicals that cause similar adverse outcomes should be examined cumulatively.<ref>Committee on the Health Risks of Phthalates, National Research Council. (2008). ''Phthalates and Cumulative Risk Assessment: The Task Ahead''. National Academies Press. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12528#toc Free full-text available].</ref>{{rp|9}} Thus, the effect of phthalates should be examined together with other antiandrogens, which otherwise may have been excluded because their mechanisms or structure are different.

===Breast cancer===

Much of the current research on effects of phthalate exposure has been focused towards children and men's health,<ref name="Lopez-Carillo, L. 2010">{{cite journal | author = Lopez-Carillo L., Hernandez-Ramirez R.U., Calafat A.M., Torres-Sanchez L., Galvan-Portillo M., Needham L.L., Ruiz-Ramos R., Cebrian M.E. | year = 2010 | title = Exposure to phthalates and breast cancer risk in Northern Mexico | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 114 | issue = 4| pages = 539–544 }}</ref> however, women may be at higher risk for potential adverse health effects of phthalates due to increased cosmetic use.  Diethyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate are especially ubiquitous in [[cosmetics]] and personal care products.<ref name="Lopez-Carillo, L. 2010"/> According to ''in vivo'' and observational studies by Davis ''et al.'' (1994) and Lopez-Carillo ''et al.'' (2010), there is an association between phthalate exposure and endocrine disruption leading to development of breast cancer.  Furthermore, it has been well documented that endocrine disruptors such as phthalates can be additive, so even very small amounts can interact with other chemicals to have cumulative, adverse "cocktail effects" <ref>Waring, R.H. & Harris, R.M.  (2011)  Endocrine disrupters – a threat to women's health?  ''Maturitas'' 68: 111-115. {{doi|10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.10.008}}</ref>

Phthalate parent compounds and/or their metabolites have recently been implicated as a cause of breast cancer (BC).  A 2010 study published in Environmental Health Perspectives for the first time implicated that the exposure to diethyl phthalates (DEP), a parent compound of the monoethyl phthalate (MEP) metabolite, may be associated with increased risk of BC (Odds Ratio of 2.20, p value for trend, p<0.003). The case-control study was age matched to 233 BC cases residing in northern Mexico.  The phthalate level was determined in urine samples collected pretreatment from the cases.  This is only a preliminary finding therefore additional research is required. Interestingly, exposure to the parent phthalate, butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP) of the monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) metabolite showed a negative association with breast cancer (Odds ratio=0.46, p value for trend, p<.008). This finding may be associated with the demethylation of the estrogen receptor complex in breast cancer cells of this particular phthalate resulting in a negative effect.<ref name="Lopez-Carillo, L. 2010"/> This explanation will require further confirmatory research since confounders may be playing an unknown role. It is also known that DEP is found in a high proportion of personal care products, deodorants and perfumes whereas in contrast, BBzP is not detected in most deodorants and hair products and in less than one-third of all products tested,<ref name="Lopez-Carillo, L. 2010"/> so degree of exposure may also be influencing results. A higher phthalate tertile (microgram/g creatinine) of DEP/MEP was compared to a lower phthalate tertile of BBzP/MBzP in this study.  In most cases of breast cancer the cause is unknown and less than 25% of patients have a history of commonly associated risk factors.<ref name="Lopez-Carillo, L. 2010"/> such as: early menarche, later age at first childbirth, nulliparity, family history of BC, or history of benign breast biopsy <ref>Cancer.org. URL: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-risk-factors. 5/7/2011.(Cancer.org).</ref>

===Endocrine disruption===
{{Main|Endocrine Disruptors}}

In studies of rodents exposed to certain phthalates, high doses have been shown to change hormone levels and cause birth defects.<ref name=CDC/> A recent British study showed that the phthalate di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) or its metabolite monobutyl phthalate (MBP) suppresses [[steroidogenesis]] by fetal-type [[Leydig cells]] in primates as in rodents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hallmark N, Walker M, McKinnell C, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of Monobutyl and Di(n-butyl) Phthalate in Vitro on Steroidogenesis and Leydig Cell Aggregation in Fetal Testis Explants from the Rat: Comparison with Effects ''in Vivo'' in the Fetal Rat and Neonatal Marmoset and in Vitro in the Human |journal=Environ.

In a study published in 2005, lead investigator Dr. Shanna Swan reported in the "Swan Study" that human phthalate exposure during pregnancy results in decreased [[anogenital distance]] among baby boys. In this study, phthalate metabolites were measured in urine samples collected from the pregnant women who gave birth to the infants.

Large amounts of specific phthalates fed to rodents have been shown to damage their [[liver]] and [[testes]],<ref name="CDC">[http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals], U.S. CDC, July 2005.</ref> and initial rodent studies also indicated [[Liver cancer|hepatocarcinogenicity]]. Following this result, [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]] was listed as a possible [[carcinogen]] by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], [[European Community|EC]], and [[WHO]].

A 2009 study published in the [[Journal of Pediatrics]] found that [[prenatal]] phthalate exposure was related to low birth weight in infants.

In 2009, South Korean scientists reported findings of a statistically significant correlation between urine phthalate concentrations in children and symptoms of [[ADHD]].

The senior epidemiologist on the study stated, "The results are concerning since increasing exposures from the lowest 25% to the highest 25% among the women in our study was associated with a doubling or tripling in the odds of motor and/or behavioral problems in the children".<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110906085354.htm</ref>

===Biological alternatives===
There are numerous biological alternatives on the market. The problem is that they are typically expensive and not compatible as a primary plasticizer. 
 
A plasticizer based on vegetable oil has been developed which uses single reactor synthesis and is compatible as a primary plasticizer.  It is a ready substitute for dioctyl pthalate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio-based plasticizer|url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Bio-Based--Phthalate-Free-Polyvinyl-Chloride-Plasticizer__20100213.aspx|publisher=University of Minnesota}}</ref>

==Legal status==

===European Union===
The use of some phthalates has been restricted in the European Union for use in children's toys since 1999.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/99/829&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en Ban of phthalates in childcare articles and toys], press release IP/99/829, 10 November 1999</ref> DEHP, [[Butyl benzyl phthalate|BBP]], and DBP are restricted for all toys; DINP, DIDP, and DNOP are restricted only in toys that can be taken into the mouth. The restriction states that the amount of phthalates may not be greater than 0.1% mass percent of the plasticized part of the toy. These phthalates are allowed at any concentration in other products and other phthalates are not restricted.

There are no other specific restrictions in the European Union, although draft proposals have been tabled for the inclusion of BBP, DEHP, and DBP on the Candidate list of Substances for Authorisation under [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]].<ref>[http://echa.europa.eu/consultations/authorisation/svhc/svhc_cons_en.asp ECHA Website - Proposal for identification of Substances of Very High Concern<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Dutch office of [[Greenpeace]] UK sought to encourage the [[European Union]] to ban sex toys that contained phthalates.<ref>[http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1995778,00.html News24]</ref> This has now been done and DEHP, BBP and DBP are listed in Annex XIV of the REACH regulation (see above)

===United States===
In August 2008, the [[United States Congress]] passed and President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] (CPSIA), which became public law 110-314.<ref>GovTrack.us. "[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-4040 H.R. 4040--110th Congress (2007): Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008], GovTrack.us (database of federal legislation) . Retrieved 14 August 2009.</ref> Section 108 of that law specified that as of February 10, 2009, "it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of" [[DEHP]], [[Dibutyl phthalate|DBP]], or [[Benzyl butyl phthalate|BBP]] and "it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy that can be placed in a child's mouth or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of" [[DINP]], [[DIDP]], [[DnOP]]. Furthermore, the law requires the establishment of a permanent review board to determine the safety of other phthalates. Prior to this legislation, the Consumer Product Safety Commission had determined that voluntary withdrawals of DEHP and DINP from teethers, pacifiers, and rattles had eliminated the risk to children, and advised against enacting a phthalate ban.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102567295 Public Concern, Not Science, Prompts Plastics Ban] by Jon Hamilton, NPR.</ref>

Some phthalates were restricted in children's toys sold in [[California]] starting in 2009.<ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i43/8543news4.html California Bans Phthalates In Toys For Children], Bette Hileman, ''Chemical and Engineering News'', OCT. 22, 2007, P. 12.</ref>

==Identification in plastics==
[[Image:Plastic-recyc-03.svg|thumb|100px|Some type 3 plastics may leach phthalates.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}]]

Phthalates are used in some but not all [[PVC]] formulations, and there are no specific labeling requirements for phthalates. PVC plastics are typically used for various containers and hard packaging, medical tubing, and bags, and are labelled "Type 3" for recycling reasons. However, the presence of phthalates rather than other plasticizers is not marked on PVC items. Only unplasticized PVC (uPVC), which is mainly used as a hard construction material, has no plasticizers.  If a more accurate test is needed, chemical analysis, for example by [[gas chromatography]] or [[liquid chromatography]], can establish the presence of phthalates.

[[Polyethylene terephthalate]] (PETE) is the main substance used to package [[bottled water]] and many sodas.  Products containing PETE are labeled "Type 1" (with a "1" in the recycle triangle) for recycling purposes.  Although the word "phthalate" appears in the name, PETE does not use phthalates as plasticizers.  The terephthalate polymer PETE and the phthalate ester plasticizers are chemically different substances.<ref>http://www.plasticsmythbuster.org/s_mythbuster/sec.asp?CID=1985&DID=8371</ref> Despite this, however, a number of studies have found phthalates such as DEHP in bottled water and soda.<ref>http://ehsehplp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.0901253</ref> One hypothesis is that these may have been introduced during plastics recycling. Several studies tested the liquids before they were bottled, in order to make sure the phthalates came from the bottles rather than already being in the water.
