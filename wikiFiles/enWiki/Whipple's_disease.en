'''Whipple's disease''' is a [[rare disease|rare]], [[Systemic disease|systemic]] infectious disease caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Tropheryma whipplei]]''. First described by [[George Hoyt Whipple]] in 1907 and commonly considered a gastrointestinal disorder, Whipple's disease primarily causes [[malabsorption]] but may affect any part of the body including the heart, lungs, brain, joints, skin, and the eyes.<ref name="Whipple_1907">{{cite journal |author=Whipple, G.&nbsp;H.|title=A hitherto undescribed disease characterized anatomically by deposits of fat and fatty acids in the intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic tissues |journal=Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital |year=1907 |volume=18 |pages=382–93}}</ref> Weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and arthritis are common presenting symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable and approximately 15% of patients do not have these classic signs and symptoms.<ref name="Bai_2004">{{cite journal |author=Bai, J.&nbsp;C., Mazure, R.&nbsp;M., Vazquez,&nbsp;H., ''et al.'' |title=Whipple's disease |journal=Clin.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms are [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]], [[weight loss]], and [[arthralgia|joint pains]]. Sometimes, the joint pains occur many years before any digestive tract symptoms develop; they tend to involve the large joints but can occur in any pattern and tend not to damage the joint surface to the point that the joint becomes deformed. Fever and [[chills]] occur in a small proportion of people.<ref name=Schneider2008>{{cite journal |author=Schneider,&nbsp;T., Moos,&nbsp;V., Loddenkemper,&nbsp;C., Marth,&nbsp;T., Fenollar,&nbsp;F., Raoult,&nbsp;D.|title=Whipple's disease: new aspects of pathogenesis and treatment |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=179–90 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18291339 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70042-2}}</ref>

In its more advanced form, [[malabsorption]] (insufficient absorption of nutrients from the diet) leads to [[cachexia|wasting]] and the enlargement of [[lymph nodes]] in the abdomen. Neurological symptoms (discussed below) are more common in those with severe abdominal disease. The poor absorption of fat means that many develop [[steatorrhea]] (fatty, offensive stool). Depletion of [[albumin]], a blood protein, causes [[peripheral edema]].<ref name=Schneider2008/>

Darkening of the skin occurs in almost half; some also have skin nodules. Various eye problems, such as [[uveitis]], may occur; this is typically associated with deteriorating vision and pain in the affected eye. [[Endocarditis]] (infection of the [[heart valve]]) has been reported in a small number of cases, sometimes in people with no other symptoms of Whipple's disease; this is typically noticed as breathlessness and leg swelling due to fluid accumulation as the heart is unable to pump fluid through the body.<ref name=Schneider2008/>

10–40% of people with Whipple's disease have problems related to involvement of the [[brain]]; the symptoms relate to the part of the brain that is affected. The most common problems are [[dementia]], [[memory loss]], [[mental confusion|confusion]], and decreased [[level of consciousness]]. Eye movement disturbances and myorhythmia (rapidly repetitive movements of the muscles) of the face, together referred to as ''oculomasticatory myorhythmia'', are [[Pathognomonic|highly characteristic]] for Whipple's disease. Weakness and poor coordination of part of the body, [[headache]]s, [[epileptic seizure|seizures]], as well as a number of more uncommon neurological features, are present in some cases.<ref name=Schneider2008/>

==Mechanism==
''T. whipplei'' is one of the [[actinomycetes]], and is a distant relative of ''[[Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium paratuberculosis]]'' explaining in part why Whipple's disease is similar to the diseases caused by these bacteria.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book |author=Strayer DL, Rubin R, Rubin E |title=Rubin's pathology: clinicopathologic foundations of medicine |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |page=583 |isbn=0-7817-9516-8}}</ref> The disease is common in [[farmer]]s and those exposed to soil and animals, suggesting that the infection is acquired from these sources.<ref name=Schneider2008/>

Individuals who are most susceptible to the disease are those with decreased ability to perform intracellular degradation of ingested pathogens or particles, particularly in the macrophages. Several studies indicate that defective T-lymphocyte (particularly TH1 population) function may be an important predisposing factor for the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marth T |title=The diagnosis and treatment of Whipple's disease |journal=Curr Allergy Asthma Rep |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=566–71 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11892086 |doi=10.1007/s11882-001-0066-7}}</ref> In particular circulating cells that are [[CD11b]] (also known as Integrin Alpha) expressive, are reduced in susceptible individuals. [[CD11b]] has a vital role in activation of macrophages to destroy intracellularly ingested ''T. whipplei'' bacteria.<ref name=Rubin/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Whipple disease -a- very high mag.jpg|thumb|High magnification [[micrograph]] showing the characteristic foamy [[macrophage]]s in the [[lamina propria]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
Common clinical signs and symptoms of Whipple's disease include weight loss, joint pain or arthritis, diarrhea, skin rashes, fever, and [[adenopathy]]. Weight loss and diarrhea are the most common symptoms that lead to identification of the process, but may be preceded by chronic, unexplained, relapsing episodes of non-destructive seronegative arthritis, often of large joints.<ref name="Puéchal2009">{{cite pmid|18722696}}</ref>
  
Diagnosis is made by [[biopsy]], usually by [[duodenum|duodenal]] [[endoscopy]], which reveals presence of the organism as [[Periodic acid-Schiff|PAS]]-positive, non-[[acid-fast]] [[macrophage]] inclusions.<ref name=Schneider2008/> [[Immunohistochemical]] staining for antibodies against ''T. whipplei'' has been used to detect the organism in a variety of tissues, and a [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]-based assay is also available.<ref name=Schneider2008/>  PCR can be confirmatory if performed on blood, [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]] fluid, [[synovium|synovial]] fluid, heart valves, or [[cerebrospinal fluid]].<ref name="CDMT2012">SJ McPhee, MA Papadakis. Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2012 McGraw-Hill ISBN 978-0-07-176372-1</ref> PCR of saliva, gastric or intestinal fluid, and stool specimens is highly sensitive, but not specific enough, indicating that healthy individuals can also harbor the causative bacterium without the manifestation of Whipple's disease, but that a negative PCR is most likely indicative of a healthy individual.<ref name=Schneider2008/>

[[Endoscopy]] of the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]] can reveal pale yellow shaggy mucosa with erythematous eroded patches in patients with classic intestinal Whipple's disease, and small bowel [[X-ray]]s may show some thickened folds. Other pathological findings may include enlarged mesentric lymph nodes, hypercellularity of [[lamina propria]] with "foamy macrophages", and a concurrent decreased number of [[lymphocytes]] and [[plasma cells]], per high power field view of the biopsy.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is with [[penicillin]], [[ampicillin]], [[tetracycline]], or [[co-trimoxazole]] for one to two years.<ref name="Bai_2004" /> Any treatment lasting less than a year has an approximate relapse rate of 40%.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Recent expert opinion is that Whipple's disease should be treated with [[doxycycline]] with [[hydroxychloroquine]] for 12 to 18 months.<ref name="Fenollar_2007"/> Sulfonamides ([[sulfadiazine]] or [[sulfamethoxazole]]) may be added for treatment of neurological symptoms.<ref name="Fenollar_2007"/>

==Epidemiology==
The disease is regarded as extremely rare, with an [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (new number of cases per year) of one case per million people. The patients are predominantly male (86% in a survey of American patients), although in some countries the rate of women receiving a diagnosis of Whipple's disease has increased in recent years. It occurs predominantly in those of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian ethnicity]], suggesting a [[genetic predisposition]] in that population.<ref name=Schneider2008/>

''T. whipplei'' appears to be an environmental organism that is commonly present in the gasterointestinal tract but remains asymptomatic.<ref name=Schneider2008/> Several lines of evidence suggest that some defect—inherited or acquired—in immunity is required for it to become pathogenic.<ref name="Marth2009">{{cite pmid|19897965}}</ref>  The possible immunological defect may be specific for ''T. whipplei'', since the disease is not associated with a substantially increased risk of other infections.<ref name="Deriban2006">{{cite pmid|17073638}}</ref> 

The disease is usually diagnosed in [[middle age]] (median 49 years). Studies from [[Germany]] have shown that age at diagnosis has been rising since the 1960s.<ref name=Schneider2008/>

==History==
Whipple described the disease in 1907 in a paper in the now-defunct ''Bulletin of Johns Hopkins Hospital''. The patient was a 35-year old medical missionary. Whipple referred to the disease as "intestinal lipodystrophy".<ref name="Whipple_1907"/> It was long presumed to be an infectious disease, but the causative organism was only fully identified in 1992.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Relman, D.&nbsp;A., Schmidt, T.&nbsp;M., MacDermott, R.&nbsp;P., Falkow,&nbsp;S. |title=Identification of the uncultured bacillus of Whipple's disease |journal=N.
