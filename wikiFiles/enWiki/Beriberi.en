'''Beriberi''' is a [[nervous system]] ailment caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamine) in the diet. [[Thiamine]] is involved in the breakdown of molecules such as [[glucose]] and is also found on the membranes of neurons. Symptoms of beriberi include severe [[lethargy]] and fatigue, together with complications affecting the [[cardiovascular]], nervous, [[muscular]], and [[gastrointestinal system]]s.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term comes from a [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] phrase meaning "weak, weak" or "I cannot, I cannot", the word being [[reduplication|reduplicated]] for emphasis.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: "Beri-beri... a Cingalese word, f. ''beri'' weakness, the reduplication being intensive ...", page 203, 1937</ref><ref>A Sinhalese-English Dictionary, Rev. Charles Carter: "බැරි බැරි.රෝගය, a. the disease ''beri beri'', a form of neuritis accompanied by dropsy &c..." , page 448, 1924</ref><ref>[http://www.faqs.org/health/topics/40/Beriberi.html Beriberi, Information about Beriberi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beri-beri Online etymology dictionary]</ref>

In 1630, a Dutch physician named Jacob de Bondt (Jacobus Bontius; 1591-1631) encountered the disease while working in Java. In the first known description of beriberi, he wrote, "A certain very troublesome affliction, which attacks men, is called by the inhabitants beriberi (which means sheep). I believe those, whom this same disease attacks, with their knees shaking and the legs raised up, walk like sheep. It is a kind of paralysis, or rather tremor: for it penetrates the motion and sensation of the hands and feet indeed sometimes of the whole body."<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jeremy M |last1=Berg |authorlink1=Jeremy M.

==History==
In Asia, where polished white rice (milled rice that has had its husk, bran, and germ removed) was the common staple food of the middle class, beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> was [[Endemism|endemic]]. In 1884, [[Takaki Kanehiro]], a British-trained Japanese medical doctor of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]], observed that beriberi was endemic among low-ranking crew who often were provided nothing but rice, but not among crews of Western navies and officers who consumed a Western-style diet.

In 1883, Kanehiro learned of a very high incidence of beriberi among cadets on a training mission from Japan to Hawaii, via New Zealand and South America that lasted more than 9 months, resulting 169 cases of sickness and 25 deaths on a ship of 376 men. With the support of the Japanese Navy, he conducted an experiment in which another ship was deployed on the same route, except that its crew was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. At the end of the voyage, this crew had suffered only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Kanehiro and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Yoshinori |last1=Itokawa |year=1976 |title=Kanehiro Takaki (1849–1920): A Biographical Sketch |journal=Journal of Nutrition |pmid=772183 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=772183 |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=581–8}}</ref>

In 1897, Dr. [[Christiaan Eijkman]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physician]] and [[pathologist]], demonstrated that beriberi is caused by poor diet, and discovered that feeding unpolished rice (instead of the polished variety) to chickens helped to prevent beriberi. The following year, Sir [[Frederick Hopkins]] postulated that some foods contained "accessory factors"&mdash;in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and salt&mdash;that were necessary for the functions of the human body.<ref name="Challem">Jack Challem (1997).

In 1929, Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for this discovery.

==Prevalence==
Beriberi is rare in [[developed countries]] because most foods are now vitamin-enriched. Excluding the presence of arsenic in the environment (e.g. well water) one can get enough thiamine by eating a normal, healthy diet. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in patients who abuse alcohol. Drinking very heavily can lead to poor nutrition, and excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store thiamine.

== General symptoms and effects ==
Its [[symptom]]s include weight loss, [[emotion]]al disturbances, impaired [[sensory perception]] ([[Wernicke's encephalopathy]]), [[muscle weakness|weakness]] and [[pain]] in the limbs, and periods of irregular [[heart rate]]. [[Edema]] (swelling of bodily tissues) is common. It may increase the amount of [[lactic acid]] and [[pyruvic acid]] within the blood. In advanced cases, the disease may cause [[High output cardiac failure]] and death.

==Types==
The main types of beriberi are:
*''Dry beriberi'' and ''Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome'' affect the peripheral and central nervous system respectively.
*''Wet beriberi'' affects the cardiovascular system, as well as other bodily systems.
*''Infantile beriberi'' affects mostly children in developing countries.

===Dry beriberi===
Dry beriberi causes wasting and partial [[paralysis]] resulting from damaged peripheral [[nerve]]s.  It is also referred to as ''endemic neuritis''. It is characterized by:
*Difficulty in walking
*Tingling or loss of feeling (sensation) in hands and feet ([[Paresthesia|numbness]])
*Loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs
*Mental confusion/speech difficulties
*Pain
*Involuntary eye movements ([[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]])
*Vomiting

A selective impairment of the large proprioceptive sensory fibers without motor impairment can occur and present as a prominent sensory ataxia, which is a loss of balance and coordination due to loss of the proprioceptive inputs from the periphery and loss of position sense.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2010.16 |title=Subacute sensory ataxia and optic neuropathy with thiamine deficiency |year=2010 |last1=Spinazzi |first1=Marco |last2=Angelini |first2=Corrado |last3=Patrini |first3=Cesare |journal=Nature Reviews Neurology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=288–93 |pmid=20308997}}</ref>

===Wet beriberi===
Wet beriberi affects the [[heart]]; it is sometimes fatal, as it causes a combination of [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]] and weakening of the [[capillary]] walls, which causes the peripheral tissues to become edematous. It is also characterized by:
*Vasodilation leading to increased arteriovenous shunt
*Peripheral edema
*Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
*Increased heart rate
*Dyspnea on exertion
*Swelling of the lower legs

===Infantile beriberi===
This type of beriberi is commonly found in children in developing countries.
Obvious signs and symptoms are crying, but not loudly and without tears.  Untreated, it can prove fatal within 24 hours.

==Exams and tests==

A physical examination may show signs of congestive heart failure,  which include:

*Difficulty breathing with [[Jugular venous pressure|neck veins]] that stick out
*Enlarged heart
*Fluid in the lungs
*Rapid heartbeat
*Swelling in both lower legs
*Confusion, memory loss, delusions, and lost sensitivity to vibrations may be witnessed on late-stage patients.

A neurological exam may show signs of:

*Changes to the gait.
*Coordination problems
*Decreased reflexes
*Drooping of the eyelids

Blood tests will measure the amount of thiamine in the blood, or the decrease in the activity of the thiamine-dependent enzyme transketolase.

==Treatment==

The goal of treatment is to provide the thiamine the body is lacking. This is done with thiamine supplements which are given by injection or administered orally.

Other vitamins may also be recommended to help.

Subsequent blood tests will determine if the thiamine supplements are being effective.

Treatment for beriberi is with [[thiamine hydrochloride]], either in tablet form or injection. A rapid and dramatic recovery within hours can be made when this is administered to patients, and their health can be improved within an hour of starting treatment. In emergency situations where concentrated thiamin supplements are unavailable, feeding the patient with a thiamin-rich diet (e.g. whole grain brown bread) will lead to recovery, though at a much slower rate.

==Causes==
Beriberi is caused by a lack of [[thiamine]] (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>). Thiamine occurs naturally in unrefined [[cereal]]s and fresh foods, particularly [[whole grain]] bread, fresh meat, [[legume]]s, green vegetables, fruit, milk, etc. Beriberi is therefore common in people whose [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] excludes these particular types of nutrition e.g. as a result of [[famine]].

Beriberi may be found in people whose diet consists mainly of polished [[white rice]], which is very low in thiamine because the thiamin-bearing husk has been removed. It can also be seen in chronic [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]s ([[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]]). [[Arsenic poisoning]] causes alterations in cellular metabolism resulting in blockage of thiamine use which results in thiamine deficiency without any dietary shortfall.<ref>Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> The mechanism of arsenic neuropathy may be similar to the neuropathy of thiamine deficiency [Sexton and Gowdy 1963], whereby arsenic inhibits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A and thus blocks the [[Citric acid cycle|Krebs cycle]].

The disease was often found in [[Asia]]n countries (especially in the 19th century and before), due to those countries' reliance on [[white rice]] as a [[staple food]].

Thiamine deficiency causes [[neuropathy]] through [[neuron]] death due to its effects upon [[astrocyte]]s. This causes alterations in their [[glutamate]] uptake, through changes in the levels of the astrocytic glutamate transporters [[EAAT1]] and [[EAAT2]] creating [[excitotoxicity]]. Other changes include those to the [[GABA]] transporter subtype [[GAT-3]], [[GFAP]], [[glutamine synthetase]], the water channel protein [[Aquaporin 4]]. These create [[lactic acidosis]], [[brain edema]], [[oxidative stress]], [[inflammation]], and [[white matter]] impairment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuint.2009.02.020 |title=Astrocytes are a major target in thiamine deficiency and Wernicke's encephalopathy |year=2009 |last1=Hazell |first1=Alan S. |journal=Neurochemistry International |volume=55 |pages=129–35 |pmid=19428817 |issue=1–3}}</ref>

A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is passed down through families. People with genetic beriberi lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time and symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, because doctors may not consider beriberi in non-alcoholics, this diagnosis is often missed.

Beriberi can occur in breast-fed infants when the mother's body is lacking in thiamine. The condition can also affect infants who are fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine.

Getting [[dialysis]] and taking high doses of diuretics can raise the risk of beriberi.  It is also occasionally diagnosed in patients having undergone [[Gastric_bypass_surgery#Variations_of_the_gastric_bypass|roux-en-y]] gastric bypass or other enteric diversion weight-loss surgery.
