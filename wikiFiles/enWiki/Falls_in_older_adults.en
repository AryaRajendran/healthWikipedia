Every year, many older people suffer from falls. These '''falls in older adults''' are a significant cause of [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]], and can have a serious effect on the person who falls.  Falls can be caused by many things, and often the cause is multi-factorial, and require a multi-disciplinary approach to treat any injuries sustained during the fall, and to prevent any future falls.<ref name="Sarofim"/>

==Definition==
The medical definition of a fall in the nonhospitalized geriatric population According to Tinetti, Speechley, and Ginter, is “an event which results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or lower level, not as a result of a major intrinsic event (such as a stroke) or overwhelming hazard.”<ref>Tinetti ME, Speechley M, Ginter SF. Risk factors for falls among elderly persons living in the community. N Engl J Med. 1988 Dec 29;319(26):1701–7. [PubMed: 3205267]</ref> Other definitions are more inclusive and do not exclude "major intrinsic events" as a fall.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2653/</ref>

Falls are one of the [[Geriatrics|giants of geriatric medicine]].

==Incidence==
Every year, the following proportion of people suffer from a fall{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}:

Falls are the commonest presenting complaint to A&E in patients over the age of 65{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

==Causes of falls==
Falls are often caused by a number of factors. The faller may live with many risk factors for falling and only have problems when another factor appears. As such, management is often tailored to treating the factor that caused the fall, rather than all of the risk factors a patient has for falling.
Risk factors grouped into intrinsic and extrinsic factors.<ref name="NSF-UK"/>

===Intrinsic Factors===
*Balance and Gait
::As a result of [[stroke]] disease, [[Parkinsonism]], [[Arthritis|arthritic changes]], [[neuropathy]], [[neuromuscular disease]] or [[vestibular disease]].
*Medications
**[[Polypharmacy]] is common in older people
**[[Sedatives]] significantly increase the risk of falling
**[[Cardiovascular]] medications can contribute towards falls
*Visual impairment
**[[Glaucoma]], [[macular degeneration]] and [[retinopathy]] increase the risk of falling{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
**[[Bifocals]] can increase the risk of falling as the lower portion of corrective lenses are optimized for distances approximately 18&nbsp;inches, thus precluding clear vision of one's feet/floor, approximately 4.5 to 5.5 feet below one's eyes.
*Cognitive problems
**[[Dementia]] increases the likelihood of falls
*Cardiovascular causes
**[[Orthostatic hypotension]]
**[[Postprandial|Postprandial hypotension]]
**[[Carotid sinus syndrome]]
**[[Neurocardiogenic syncope]] - the commonest cause of syncope in A&E patients
**[[Cardiac arrhythmias]]
**Structural heart disease, such as [[valvular heart disease]]
*[[Urinary incontinence]]

===Extrinsic Factors===
*Poor lighting
*Stairs
*Rugs/floor surfaces
*Clothing/footwear
*Lack of equipment/aids

==Consequences of falls<ref name="NSF-UK">Department of Health, ''National service framework for older people; Standard 6 - Falls'', Crown Copyright, 24 May 2001, [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4003066] accessed:19/5/2008</ref>==
*'''Trauma'''
**Soft tissue injuries. Bilateral orbital haematomas (two black eyes) suggests that the faller was probably not conscious as they fell, as they did not manage to protect their face as they hit the ground.
**[[Bone fracture|Fractures]] and [[Joint dislocation|dislocations]]. 5% of fallers end up having a fracture as a result of their fall, and 1% fracture their [[Hip fracture|neck of femur]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.
*'''"Long Lies"'''
**[[Pneumonia]]
**[[Pressure sores]]
**[[Dehydration]]
**[[Hypothermia]]
*'''Psychological'''
**A fear of falling

==Presentation and assessment==
When assessing a patient who has fallen, it is important to try to get an eye-witness account of the incident. As the faller may have had some loss of consciousness, they may not give an accurate description of the fall. However, in practice, these eye-witness accounts are often unavailable. It is also important to remember than 30% of cognitively intact older people are unable to remember a documented fall three months later{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.
Important features to ask about include:
*The number of falls
*Eye witness account
*Associated features
*Risk factors for falling
*What drugs the faller is taking
*How much [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] the faller drinks

==Investigations==
It is good practice to exclude [[anaemia]], [[renal failure]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]], and to perform an [[ECG]] and a [[chest x-ray]]. Other tests should be tailored to the cause of the fall.

==Interventions==
{{main| Fall prevention}}
A large body of evidence shows that a multi-disciplinary approach to assessment and treatment results in the best outcome.<ref>{{ cite journal | last = Tinetti | first = ME  | coauthors = Baker DI, Garrett PA, Gottschalk M, Koch ML, Horwitz RI | year = 1993 | month = March | title = Yale FICSIT: risk factor abatement strategy for fall prevention  | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 315–20  | pmid = 8440856}}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal | last = Tinetti | first = ME | coauthors = Baker DI, McAvay G, Claus EB, Garrett P, Gottschalk M, Koch ML, Trainor K, Horwitz RI.| year = 1994 | month = September | title = A multifactorial intervention to reduce the risk of falling among elderly people living in the community | journal = N Engl J Med. | volume = 331 | issue = 13 | pages = 821–7 | pmid = 8078528 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/13/821 | accessdate = 2008-05-19 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199409293311301}}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal | last = Close | first = J | coauthors = Ellis M, Hooper R, Glucksman E, Jackson S, Swift C. | year = 1999 | month = January | title = Prevention of falls in the elderly trial (PROFET): a randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume =  353 | issue = 9147 | pages = 93–7| pmid = 10023893 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)06119-4}}</ref>

Possible interventions include:
*[[Hip protector]]s
*Regular exercise
*Treatment for [[osteoporosis]]
*Review - monitoring of medications and ongoing medical problems
*Tackling environmental issues

==Research==
A fall occurs when a person's center of pressure (COP) goes outside of the base of support. A majority of research on postural instability has focused on the anterior/posterior directions due to the structure of the legs and the frequency of falls in those directions.  Maki, Holliday, & Topper (1994) has stated that sway in the medial/lateral directions can be just as important, “Results show strong evidence linking deficits in postural balance related to the control of the m-l stability with an increased risk of falling”.<ref name="Maki">Maki, B. E., Holliday, P. J., & Topper, A.K. (1994). ''A prospective study of postural balance and risk of falling in an ambulatory and independent elderly population'', Journal of Gerontology, 49(2), M72-M84.</ref> The mechanisms of postural instability are not fully understood, but research has suggested that disorders affecting sensory input and efferent motor signals are the primary causes.

Furthermore, a recent systematic review has demonstrated that performing dual-task tests (for example, combining a walking task with a counting task) may help in predicting which people are at an increased risk of a fall.<ref name="Sarofim">Sarofim, M. (2012). "Predicting falls in the elderly: do dual-task tests offer any added value? A systematic review". AMSJ; 3(2): 13-19.</ref>
