'''Myanmar Red Cross Society''' (MRCS) was founded in 1937 and it was earlier called Burma Red Cross. It has its headquarters in [[Yangon]].

==History==

In 1920, the Society came into existence as a branch of [[Indian Red Cross Society]]. When Burma was politically separated from India in 1937, it attained national status and was recognized as Burma Red Cross Society. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) recognized it as a National Society in 1939. The Society was admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in 1946. The Burma Red Cross Act was enacted in 1959 and amended subsequently in 1964, 1971 and 1988.

The 1959 (MRCS) Act confers responsibility to the National Society in implementing humanitarian activities and alleviating human suffering. The St. John Ambulance Brigade Overseas was taken over by the Society as Burma Ambulance Brigade under the 1959 Act. The Society was renamed Myanmar Red Cross Society in accordance with legislative change of the name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989.

The objective of the Society is to alleviate human suffering. Three activities such as promoting health, preventing diseases and providing help to those in distress are supportive activities to meet the objective.

As the leading humanitarian organization, Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) is committed to assist vulnerable people and to improve and maintain their health and well-being.
The Society obtains the best relations with UN Agencies, Non Government Organizations, Press and other public information media. News coverage of Red Cross Activities in the whole country is constantly made by the press, radio and television news stations.
