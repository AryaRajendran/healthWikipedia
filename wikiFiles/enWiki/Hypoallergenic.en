{{wiktionarypar|hypoallergenic}}
'''Hypoallergenic''', meaning "below normal" or "slightly" allergenic, was a term first used in a cosmetics campaign in 1953.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/microscope/micro_2000/hypoallergenic.html | title=CBC News: Marketplace â€“ Microscope}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> It is used to describe items (especially cosmetics and textiles) that cause or are claimed to cause fewer [[allergy|allergic]] reactions. Hypoallergenic pets still produce [[allergen]]s, but because of their coat type, absence of fur, or absence of a gene that produces a certain protein, they typically produce fewer allergens than others of the same species. People with severe allergies and [[asthma]] may still be affected by a hypoallergenic pet.

Note that the term lacks a medical definition, but it is in common usage and found in most standard English dictionaries. In some countries, there are allergy interest groups that provide manufacturers with a certification procedure including tests that ensure a product is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction, but such products are usually described and labeled using other but similar terms. So far, public authorities in no country provide an official certification that an item must undergo before being described as ''hypoallergenic''. The cosmetic industry has been trying for years to establish an industry standard for use of the term.<ref name=nonmedical-term>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/pre-2007/microscope/micro_2000/hypoallergenic.html|title=Hypoallergenic: What's in a word?|accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060619171056/http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/microscope/micro_2000/hypoallergenic.html |archivedate = June 19, 2006|work=CBC News}}</ref>

==Hypoallergenic pets==

"Hypoallergenic pets" are breeds of pet animals (e.g., some breeds of dogs) that are less likely to trigger allergic reactions in people who are sensitized to the pet species (e.g., in people generally allergic to dogs).

With regard to [[allergy]] sufferers, a hypoallergenic [[pet]] would presumably enable them to have a pet in their home, whereas most [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and other fur-bearing animals can cause an allergic reaction.  The proteins that cause allergies are found not only in the animals' fur or hair but also in saliva, urine, mucous, and hair roots and in the [[dander]] sloughed from the animals' skin. Thus, the widespread idea that "hypoallergenic pets" are those that have less hair or shed less is a myth.

Some [[dog breed]]s have been promoted as hypoallergenic because they do not shed their hair, shed very little, or have the same pH as human hair.  However, no canine is known to be completely nonallergenic. [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s, [[Poodle]]s and [[Poodle hybrids]] are commonly mistaken as being hypoallergenic, when in reality they are known to cause different forms of allergies, including bronchitis, as does any breed of dog.  

Cat breeds such as the [[LaPerm]], [[Sphynx (cat)|Sphynx]], [[Devon Rex]] and [[Cornish Rex]], which lack some or all of the normal layers in cats' fur, are believed by mild allergy sufferers to be significantly less likely to provoke an allergic reaction than other breeds.  [[Siberian (cat)|Siberian cats]] and [[Russian Blue]] are also believed by some to have such properties.  

A company called [[Allerca]] recently claimed to be able to produce a so-called [[hypoallergenic cat]] using [[gene silencing]], but it has now instead used traditional breeding methods, starting with cats that naturally lack the gene that produces the glycoprotein [[Fel d 1]] causing an allergic reaction in some people. However, no peer-reviewed studies have confirmed the company's claims and some scientists are skeptical of the company's assertions.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20100807022455/http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56191/</ref> Allerca is currently accepting orders for hypoallergenic kittens.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5375900.stm?ls 'Hypoallergenic cats' go on sale]</ref> Another company, [http://www.felixpets.com/ Felix Pets], also claims to be developing a breed of hypoallergenic cat. 


There is only one known hypoallergenic horse breed. The [[Bashkir Curly]] horse has a uniquely textured coat that lacks the protein (present in all other horse fur) believed to be the source of allergic reactions to equines. Many people with severe allergies to horses can handle Bashkir Curlies with no reaction.
