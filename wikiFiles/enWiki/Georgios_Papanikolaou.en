'''Georgios Nikolaou Papanikolaou''' (or '''George Papanicolaou'''; {{lang-el|Γεώργιος Ν. Παπανικολάου}}; May 13, 1883 – February 19, 1962) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] pioneer in [[cytopathology]] and early [[cancer]] detection, and inventor of the "[[Pap smear]]".

==Life==
Papanikolaou studied at the [[University of Athens]], where he received his medical degree in 1904. Six years later he received his Ph.D. from the University of [[Munich]], [[Germany]], after he had also spent time at the universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]].<ref>http://www.hemonctoday.com/article.aspx?rID=26601</ref> In 1910, Papanikolaou returned to Athens and got married to Andromahi Mavrogeni and then departed for Monaco where he worked for the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco, participating in the Oceanographic Exploration Team of the Prince of Monaco (1911).<ref>Marketos Spyros "Georgios Papanikolaou, History of Medicine of the 20th Century, Greek Pioneers". Zeta Publishers, Athens 2000</ref>

In 1913 he emigrated to the U.S. in order to work  in the department of [[Pathology]] of [[New York Hospital]] and the Department of [[Anatomy]] at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College|Weill Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]]. 

He first reported that uterine cancer could be diagnosed by means of a vaginal smear in 1928, but the importance of his work was not recognized until the publication, together with Herbert Traut, of ''Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the Vaginal Smear'' in 1943. The book discusses the preparation of vaginal and cervical smears, physiologic cytologic changes during the [[menstrual cycle]], the effects of various pathological conditions, and the changes seen in the presence of [[cancer]] of the [[cervix]] and of the [[endometrium]] of the [[uterus]]. He thus became known for his invention of the Papanicolaou test, commonly known as the [[Pap smear]] or [[Pap test]], which is used worldwide for the detection and prevention of [[cervical cancer]] and other cytologic diseases of the female [[reproductive system]].

In 1961 he moved to [[Miami, Florida]], to develop the Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute at the [[University of Miami]], but died in 1962 prior to its opening.

Papanicolaou was the recipient of the [[Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research]] in 1950.<ref name="Lasker Award">{{cite web|url=http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/1950clinical.htm|title=Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award - 1950 Winners|work=[[Lasker Foundation]]|publisher=laskerfoundation.org|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>

Papanikolaou's portrait appeared on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Greek 10,000-[[Greek drachma|drachma]] [[banknote]] of 1995-2001,<ref>[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece].

In 1978 his work was honored by the [[U.S. Postal Service]] with a 13-cent stamp for early cancer detection.

==Discoveries==
[[File:Pap test abnormal.JPG|thumb|[[Pap test]] abnormal.]]

The fact that malignant cells could be seen under the microscope was first pointed out in a book on diseases of the lung, by [[Walter Hayle Walshe]] (1812–92), professor and physician to University College Hospital, London, in 1843. This fact was recounted by Papanikolaou. 

In 1923 Papanikolaou told an incredulous audience of physicians about the noninvasive technique of gathering cellular debris from the lining of the vaginal tract and smearing it on a glass slide for microscopic examination as a way to identify cervical cancer. That year he had undertaken a study of vaginal fluid in women, in hopes of observing cellular changes over the course of a menstrual cycle. In female guinea pigs, Papanicolaou had already noticed cell transformation and wanted to corroborate the phenomenon in human females. It happened that one of Papanicolaou's human subjects was suffering from uterine cancer.

Upon examination of a slide made from a smear of the patient's vaginal fluid, Papanicolaou discovered that abnormal cancer cells could be plainly observed under a microscope. "The first observation of cancer cells in the smear of the uterine cervix," he later wrote, "gave me one of the greatest thrills I ever experienced during my scientific career."

The Romanian physician [[Aurel Babeş]] made similar discoveries in the cytologic diagnosis of cervical cancer.<ref>O'Dowd MJ, Philipp EE. ''The History of Obstetrics & Gynaecology''. London: Parthenon Publishing Group; 1994: 547</ref>  Babeş's 1927 work, however, was published in the ''Proceedings of the Bucharest Gynecological Society'', and it is unlikely that Papanicolaou was aware of it. Recent papers have proven beyond doubt that Babe's method was radically different from Papanicolaou's and that the paternity of Pap test belongs solely to Papanicolaou [Diamantis A, Magiorkinis E, Androutsos G. Different strokes: Pap-test and Babes method are not one and the same. Diagn Cytopathol. 2010 Nov;38(11):857-9.] 

At a 1928 medical conference in Battle Creek, Michigan, Papanicolaou introduced his low-cost, easily performed screening test for early detection of cancerous and precancerous cells. However, this potential medical breakthrough was initially met with skepticism and resistance from the scientific community. Papanicolaou's next communication on the subject did not appear until 1941 when, with gynecologist Herbert Traut, he published a paper on the diagnostic value of vaginal smears in [[uterine cancer|carcinoma of the uterus]].<ref>Papanicolaou GN, Traut HF. "The diagnostic value of vaginal smears in carcinoma of the uterus". ''American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology''. 1941;42:193.</ref> This was followed 2 years later by an illustrated monograph based on a study of over 3,000 cases. In 1954 he published another memorable work, the ''Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology'', thus creating the foundation of the modern medical specialty of [[cytopathology]].
