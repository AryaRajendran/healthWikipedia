{{Tobacco}}

The '''health effects of tobacco''' are the circumstances, mechanisms, and factors of tobacco consumption on human health. Epidemiological research has been focused primarily on cigarette tobacco smoking,<ref name="WHOPrevalenceAdultsAge15" /> which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption.<ref name="WHOMayoReport" />

It also causes peripheral vascular disease and [[hypertension]]. The effects depend on the number of years that a person smokes and on how much the person smokes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] increases the risk of these diseases.

The shift in prevalence of tobacco smoking to a younger demographic, mainly in the developing world, can be attributed to several factors. The tobacco industry spends up to $12.5 billion annually on advertising, which is increasingly geared towards adolescents in the developing world because they are a very vulnerable audience for the marketing campaigns. Adolescents have more difficulty understanding the long term health risks that are associated with smoking and are also more easily influenced by “images of romance, success, sophistication, popularity, and adventure which advertising suggests they could achieve through the consumption of cigarettes”. This shift in marketing towards adolescents and even children in the tobacco industry is debilitating to organizations’ and countries’ efforts to improve child health and mortality in the developing world. It reverses or halts the effects of the work that has been done to improve health care in these countries, and although smoking is deemed as a “voluntary” health risk, the marketing of tobacco towards very impressionable adolescents in the developing world makes it less of a voluntary action and more of an inevitable shift.<ref name="Nichter_1991"/>

Many government regulations have been passed to protect citizens from harm caused by public environmental tobacco smoke. The "Pro-Children Act of 2001" prohibits smoking within any facility that provides health care, day care, library services, or elementary and secondary education to children.<ref>Elementary and Secondary Education | Environmental Tobacco Smoke | Pro-Children Act of 2001 | Non-Smoking Policy for Children’s Services | Section 4303</ref>

== History ==
Concern about the health effects of tobacco has a long history. As early as 1604 '''[[James VI and I|James I]]''' wrote [[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]], in which he said that tobacco users were "harming your selves both in persons and goods" and the [[Word of Wisdom]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], written in 1833, prohibits the ingestion of tobacco thus: "…tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill." (Doctrine and Covenants 89:8).{{Primary source-inline|date=May 2012}}

[[Gideon Lincecum]], an American naturalist and practitioner of botanical medicine, wrote in the early 19th century on tobacco: "This poisonous plant has been used a great deal as a medicine by the old school faculty, and thousands have been slain by it. ... It is a very dangerous article, and use it as you will, it always diminishes the vital energies in exact proportion to the quantity used - it may be slowly, but it is very sure."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lincecum|first=Gideon|title=Nicotiana tabacum|url=http://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/prc/lincecum/pages/Nicotiana_tabacum-notes.html|work=Giden Lincecum Herbarium|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>

The late-19th century invention of automated cigarette-making machinery in the American South made possible mass production of cigarettes at low cost, and cigarettes became elegant and fashionable among society men as the Victorian era gave way to the Edwardian. In 1912, American Dr. Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that lung [[cancer]] is related to smoking.<ref name="pmid6773624">{{cite journal | author = Adler IA | title = Classics in oncology.

Prior to World War I, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, which most physicians would never see during their career.<ref name="Cite pmid|11606795"/><ref>{{cite book | author = Adler I | title = Primary malignant growths of the lungs and bronchi: a pathological and clinical study | location = New York | publisher = Longmans, Green | year = 1912 | oclc = 14783544 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=SucRAAAAYAAJ}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}, cited in {{Cite doi|10.1164/rccm.200504-531OE}}</ref> With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking, however, came an epidemic of lung cancer.

In 1950, [[Richard Doll]] published research in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' showing a close link between smoking and lung cancer.<ref name="Cite pmid|14772469"/> Four years later, in 1954, the [[British Doctors Study]], a study of some 40,000 doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related.<ref name="pmid15217868">{{cite journal | author = Doll R, Hill AB | title = The mortality of doctors in relation to their smoking habits: a preliminary report. 1954 | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7455 | pages = 1529–33; discussion 1533 | year = 2004 | month = June | pmid = 15217868 | pmc = 437141 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7455.1529 }}</ref> The British Doctors Study lasted until 2001, with results published every ten years and final results published in 2004 by Doll and [[Richard Peto]].<ref name="Doll2004">{{Cite pmid|15213107}}</ref> Much early research was also done by [[Alton Ochsner]]. [[Reader's Digest]] magazine for many years published frequent anti-smoking articles. In 1964, the United States [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]'s [[Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States|Report on Smoking and Health]], led millions of American smokers to quit, the banning of certain advertising, and the requirement of warning labels on tobacco products.

=== Studies ===
The term "smoker" is used to mean a person who habitually smokes tobacco on a daily basis. This category has been the focus of the vast majority of tobacco studies. However, the health effects of less-than-daily smoking are far less well understood. Studies have often taken the data of "occasional smokers" (those who have never smoked daily) and grouped them with those who have never smoked.<ref name="Bjerregaard_2006">{{cite journal | author = Bjerregaard BK, Raaschou-Nielsen O, Sørensen M, Frederiksen K, Tjønneland A, Rohrmann S, Linseisen J, Bergman MM, Boeing H, Sieri S, Palli D, Tumino R, Sacerdote C, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Büchner FL, Gram IT, Braaten T, Lund E, Hallmans G, Agren A, Riboli E | title = The effect of occasional smoking on smoking-related cancers: in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) | journal = Cancer Causes Control | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1305–9 | year = 2006 | month = December | pmid = 17111263 | doi = 10.1007/s10552-006-0068-9 | url = }}</ref>

In the 1930s German scientists showed that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.<ref name="isbn1-59691-610-9">{{cite book | author = Oreskes N Conway EM | title = [[Merchants of Doubt]]: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | location = San Francisco, CA | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 1-59691-610-9 }}</ref>{{RP|15}} In 1938 a study by a [[Johns Hopkins University]] scientist suggested a strongly negative correlation between smoking and lifespan.

In 1953, scientists at the [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Institute]] in New York City demonstrated that cigarette tar painted on the skin of mice caused fatal cancers.<ref name="isbn1-59691-610-9"/> This work attracted much media attention; the ''New York Times'' and ''Life'' both covered the issue. The ''Reader's Digest'' published an article entitled "Cancer by the Carton".<ref name="isbn1-59691-610-9"/>{{RP|14}}

A team of British scientists headed by [[Richard Doll]] carried out a longitudinal study of 34,439 medical specialists from 1951 to 2001, generally called the "[[British Doctors Study]]."<ref name="Doll_2004">{{Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.38142.554479.AE}}</ref> The study demonstrated that about half of the persistent cigarette smokers born in 1900–1909 were eventually killed by their addiction (calculated from the [[logarithm]]s of the probabilities of surviving from 35–70, 70–80, and 80–90) and about two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers born in the 1920s would eventually be killed by their addiction. After a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places was introduced in Scotland in March 2006, there was a 17 percent reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome. 67% of the decrease occurred in non-smokers.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJMsa0706740}}</ref>

The health effects of tobacco have been significant for the development of the science of [[epidemiology]]. As the mechanism of carcinogenicity is radiomimetic or radiological, the effects are [[stochastic]]. Definite statements can be made only on the relative increased or decreased probabilities of contracting a given disease; For a particular individual, it is impossible to definitively prove a direct causal link between exposure to a radiomimetic poison such as tobacco smoke and the cancer that follows; such statements can only be made at the aggregate population level. Tobacco companies have capitalized on this philosophical objection and exploited the doubts of clinicians, who consider only individual cases, on the causal link in the stochastic expression of the toxicity as actual disease.<ref name="isbn0-465-07047-7">{{cite book | author = Brandt AM | title = The cigarette century: the rise, fall and deadly persistence of the product that defined America | publisher = Basic Books, a member of the Perseus Books Group | location = New York | year = 2007 | pages = | isbn = 0-465-07047-7 }}</ref>

There have been multiple court cases on the issue that tobacco companies have researched the health effects of tobacco, but suppressed the findings or formatted them to imply lessened or no hazard.<ref name="isbn0-465-07047-7"/>

A recent European study on occasional smoking published findings that the risk of the major smoking-related cancers for occasional smokers was 1.24 times that of those who have never smoked at all but the result was not statistically significant. (For a [[confidence interval]] of 95%, this data showed an incidence rate ratio of 0.80 to 1.94.)<ref name="Bjerregaard_2006"/> (Data reduction used Cox proportional hazard model, stratified by gender and country.) This compares to studies showing that habitual heavy smokers have greater than 50 times the incidence of smoking-related cancers.

A study published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]''<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1542/peds.2008-2184}}</ref> refers to the danger posed by what the authors call "third-hand smoke" — toxic substances that remain in areas where smoking has recently occurred.

[[File:Risks form smoking-smoking can damage every part of the body.png|thumb|300px|Smoking can damage every part of the body]]

A person's increased [[risk]] of contracting disease is directly proportional to the length of time that a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked. However, if someone stops smoking, then these chances gradually decrease as the damage to their body is repaired. A year after quitting, the risk of contracting heart disease is half that of a continuing smoker.<ref name="urlBenefits of Quitting - American Lung Association">{{cite web | url =http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/how-to-quit/why-quit/benefits-of-quitting/ | title = Benefits of Quitting - American Lung Association | date = | work = Stop Smoking | publisher = American Lung Association | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref> The health risks of smoking are not uniform across all smokers. Risks vary according to amount of tobacco smoked, with those who smoke more at greater risk. Light cigarette smoking still poses a significant (though reduced) health risk, as does pipe and cigar smoking.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Smoking so-called "light" cigarettes does not reduce the risk.

Tobacco use most commonly leads to diseases affecting the heart and [[respiratory system|lungs]] and will most commonly affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a major risk factor for [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]] (COPD), [[emphysema]], and [[cancer]], particularly [[lung cancer]], cancers of the [[larynx]] and [[mouth]], and [[pancreatic cancer]].

=== Cancer ===
The primary risks of tobacco usage include many forms of cancer, particularly [[lung cancer]],<ref name="urlwww.legacyforhealth.org">{{cite web | url =http://www.legacyforhealth.org/PDFPublications/Lung_Cancer_and_Smoking.pdf | title = Lung Cancer and Smoking | date = 2010-11-23 | work = Fact Sheet | publisher = www.LegacyForHealth.org | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref> [[kidney cancer]],<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.130}}</ref> [[Laryngeal cancer|cancer of the larynx]] and [[Head and neck cancer|head and neck]], [[breast cancer]],<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s10549-006-9255-3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|8178779}}</ref> [[bladder cancer]],<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1080/03008880802283664}}</ref> [[esophageal cancer|cancer of the esophagus]],<ref name="url_www.cancer.org_EsophagusCancer">{{cite web | url =http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/EsophagusCancer/DetailedGuide/esophagus-cancer-risk-factors | title = Esophagus Cancer | date = 2011-08-11  | work = | publisher = American Cancer Society | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref> [[pancreatic cancer|cancer of the pancreas]]<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s00423-007-0266-2}}</ref> and [[stomach cancer]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|12270001}}</ref>

There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of [[myeloid leukaemia]], [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell sinonasal cancer]], [[liver cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]], cancers of [[Gallbladder cancer|the gallbladder]], [[Adrenocortical carcinoma|the adrenal gland]], [[Small intestine cancer|the small intestine]], and various childhood cancers. Recent studies have established a stronger relationship between tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, and [[cervical cancer]] in women.<ref name="pmid9445794">{{cite journal | author = | title = A new reason not to smoke |journal = Environ.

The risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1371/journal.pmed.0050185}}</ref>

=== Pulmonary ===
[[File:Cancer smoking lung cancer correlation from NIH.svg|frame|right|Since establishing causation through experimental trials was not possible due to ethical restrictions, a lengthy study was conducted in order to establish the strong association necessary to allow for legislative action against tobacco consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}]]

In smoking, long term exposure to compounds found in the smoke (e.g., [[carbon monoxide]] and [[cyanide]]) are believed to be responsible for pulmonary damage and for loss of elasticity in the [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], leading to emphysema and COPD. [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking, is a permanent, incurable (often terminal) reduction of pulmonary capacity characterised by shortness of breath, wheezing, persistent cough with [[sputum]], and damage to the lungs, including [[emphysema]] and [[chronic bronchitis]].<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.332.7550.1142}}</ref> The carcinogen acrolein and its derivatives also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in COPD.<ref name="Facchinetti">{{Cite doi|10.1165/rcmb.2007-0130OC}}</ref>

=== Cardiovascular ===
[[File:Smoking and Atherosclerosis.jpg|thumb|Smoking can cause [[atherosclerosis]] leading to [[coronary artery disease]] and [[peripheral arterial disease]]]]

[[File:Nicotine stains10.JPG|thumb|Tobacco stains on primarily the 2nd and 3rd fingers in a heavy smoker.]]

Inhalation of tobacco smoke causes several immediate responses within the heart and blood vessels. Within one minute the heart rate begins to rise, increasing by as much as 30 percent during the first 10 minutes of smoking. Carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke exerts its [[carbon monoxide poisoning|negative effects]] by reducing the blood’s ability to carry oxygen. Both of these conditions can become permanent with prolonged use of cigarettes.<ref name="pmid16992272">{{cite journal |author = Haldane J | title = The Action of Carbonic Oxide on Man | journal = J.

Smoking also increases the chance of [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[atherosclerosis]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing the likelihood of a blockage, and thus a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[stroke]]. According to a study by an international team of [[James A. Schoenberger|researchers]], people under 40 are five times more likely to have a heart attack if they smoke.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk.330">{{Cite news|title=Health : Young smokers' heart attack risk|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3590320.stm|accessdate=2005-12-18|publisher=BBC  | date=2004-08-24}}</ref>

Recent research by American biologists has shown that cigarette smoke also influences the process of cell division in the cardiac muscle and changes the heart's shape.<ref name="InfoNIAC.com">{{Cite news|title=Cigarette Smoke Changes Heart's Shape|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/cigarette-smoke-changes-heart-s-shape.html|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=InfoNIAC.com}}</ref>

The usage of tobacco has also been linked to [[Buerger's disease]] (''thromboangiitis obliterans'') the acute inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) of arteries and veins of the hands and feet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Although cigarette smoking causes a greater increase of the risk of cancer than cigar smoking, cigar smokers still have an increased risk for many health problems, including cancer, when compared to non-smokers.<ref name="Burns"/><ref name=Symm>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s10935-005-5389-z}}</ref> As for second-hand smoke, the NIH study points to the large amount of smoke generated by one cigar, saying "cigars can contribute substantial amounts of tobacco smoke to the indoor environment; and, when large numbers of cigar smokers congregate together in a cigar smoking event, the amount of ETS [i.e. second-hand smoke] produced is sufficient to be a health concern for those regularly required to work in those environments."<ref name=NIH/>

Smoking tends to increase blood cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (the "good" cholesterol) to low-density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol) tends to be lower in smokers compared to non-smokers. Smoking also raises the levels of fibrinogen and increases platelet production (both involved in blood clotting) which makes the blood viscous. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying component in red blood cells), resulting in a much stabler complex than haemoglobin bound with oxygen or carbon dioxide—the result is permanent loss of blood cell functionality. Blood cells are naturally recycled after a certain period of time, allowing for the creation of new, functional erythrocytes. However, if carbon monoxide exposure reaches a certain point before they can be recycled, hypoxia (and later death) occurs. All these factors make smokers more at risk of developing various forms of arteriosclerosis. As the arteriosclerosis progresses, blood flows less easily through rigid and narrowed blood vessels, making the blood more likely to form a thrombosis (clot). Sudden blockage of a blood vessel may lead to an infarction (stroke). However, it is also worth noting that the effects of smoking on the heart may be more subtle. These conditions may develop gradually given the smoking-healing cycle (the human body heals itself between periods of smoking), and therefore a smoker may develop less significant disorders such as worsening or maintenance of unpleasant dermatological conditions, e.g. eczema, due to reduced blood supply. Smoking also increases blood pressure and weakens blood vessels.<ref name="Narkiewicz_2005"/>

=== Renal ===
In addition to increasing the risk of kidney cancer, smoking can also contribute to additional [[renal]] damage. Smokers are at a significantly increased risk for [[chronic kidney disease]] than non-smokers.<ref name="pmid21108832">{{cite journal | author = Yacoub R, Habib H, Lahdo A, Al Ali R, Varjabedian L, Atalla G, Kassis Akl N, Aldakheel S, Alahdab S, Albitar S | title = Association between smoking and chronic kidney disease: a case control study | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 10| pages = 731 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21108832 | pmc = 3004836 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-10-731  }}</ref> A history of smoking encourages the progression of [[diabetic nephropathy]].<ref name="pmid8137682">{{cite journal | author = Sawicki PT, Didjurgeit U, Mühlhauser I, Bender R, Heinemann L, Berger M | title = Smoking is associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–31 | year = 1994 | month = February | pmid = 8137682 | doi =10.2337/diacare.17.2.126 }}</ref>

=== Influenza ===
A study of an outbreak of A(H1N1) influenza in an Israeli military unit of 336 healthy young men to determine the relation of cigarette smoking to the incidence of clinically apparent influenza, revealed that, of 168 smokers, 68.5 percent had influenza, as compared with 47.2 percent of nonsmokers. Influenza was also more severe in the smokers; 50.6 percent of the smokers lost work days or required bed rest, or both, as compared with 30.1 percent of the nonsmokers.<ref name="Kark_1982">{{cite journal | author = Kark JD, Lebiush M, Rannon L | title = Cigarette smoking as a risk factor for epidemic a(h1n1) influenza in young men | journal = N.

According to a study of 1,900 male cadets after the 1968 Hong Kong A2 influenza epidemic at a South Carolina military academy, compared with nonsmokers heavy smokers (more than 20 cigarettes per day), had 21% more illnesses and 20% more bed rest, light smokers (less than 20 cigarettes per day) had 10% more illnesses and 7% more bed rest.<ref name="Finklea_1969">{{cite journal | author = Finklea JF, Sandifer SH, Smith DD | title = Cigarette smoking and epidemic influenza | journal = Am.

The effect of cigarette smoking upon epidemic influenza was studied prospectively among 1,811 male college students. Clinical influenza incidence among those who daily smoked 21 or more cigarettes was 21% higher than that of non-smokers. Influenza incidence among smokers of 1 to 20 cigarettes daily was intermediate between non-smokers and heavy cigarette smokers.<ref name="Finklea_1969"/>

Surveillance of a 1979 influenza outbreak at a military base for women in Israel revealed that influenza symptoms developed in 60.0% of the current smokers vs. 41.6% of the nonsmokers.<ref name="pmid7212144">{{cite journal | author = Kark JD, Lebiush M | title = Smoking and epidemic influenza-like illness in female military recruits: a brief survey |journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 530–2 | year = 1981 | month = May | pmid = 7212144 | pmc = 1619723 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.71.5.530 }}</ref>

Smoking seems to cause a higher relative influenza-risk in older populations than in younger populations. In a prospective study of community-dwelling people 60–90 years of age, during 1993, of unimmunized people 23% of smokers had clinical influenza as compared with 6% of non-smokers.<ref name="pmid10487646">{{cite journal | author = Nicholson KG, Kent J, Hammersley V | title = Influenza A among community-dwelling elderly persons in Leicestershire during winter 1993-4; cigarette smoking as a risk factor and the efficacy of influenza vaccination | journal = Epidemiol.

Smoking may substantially contribute to the growth of influenza epidemics affecting the entire population.<ref name="Kark_1982"/> However the proportion of influenza cases in the general non-smoking population attributable to smokers has not yet been calculated.

=== Oral ===
Perhaps the most serious oral condition that can arise is that of [[oral cancer]]. However, smoking also increases the risk for various other oral diseases, some almost completely exclusive to tobacco users. The [[National Institutes of Health]], through the [[National Cancer Institute]], determined in 1998 that "cigar smoking causes a variety of cancers including cancers of the [[oral cancer|oral cavity]] (lip, tongue, mouth, throat), [[Esophageal cancer|esophagus]], [[Laryngeal cancer|larynx]], and [[lung cancer|lung]]."<ref name=NIH>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/apr98/nci-10a.htm|title=Background on Cigar Monograph: Cigars: Health Effects and Trends|date=1998-04-10|accessdate=2008-01-04|author=[[National Institutes of Health]] }}</ref> [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|Pipe]] smoking involves significant health risks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/96/11/853/T2|title=Questions About Smoking, Tobacco, and Health|author=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|15173269}}</ref> particularly oral cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/pipes|author=Loren Stein|title=Pipe Smoking|publisher=A Healthy Me!|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=943&page=250|author=Commission on Life Sciences|title=Environmental Tobacco Smoke: Measuring Exposures and Assessing Health Effects (1986)|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> Roughly half of [[periodontitis]] or inflammation around the teeth cases are attributed to current or former smoking.

Tobacco is also linked to susceptibility to infectious diseases, particularly in the lungs. Smoking more than 20 [[cigarette]]s a day increases the risk of [[tuberculosis]] by two to four times,<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.06.034}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJMsa0707719}}</ref> and being a current smoker has been linked to a fourfold increase in the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJM200003093421002}}</ref> It is believed that smoking increases the risk of these and other pulmonary and respiratory tract infections both through structural damage and through effects on the immune system.

=== Female infertility ===
{{See also|Female infertility#Tobacco smoking}}

Smoking is harmful to the ovaries, potentially causing [[female infertility]], and the degree of damage is dependent upon the amount and length of time a woman smokes. Nicotine and other harmful chemicals in cigarettes interfere with the body’s ability to create [[estrogen]], a hormone that regulates [[folliculogenesis]] and [[ovulation]]. Also, cigarette smoking interferes with folliculogenesis, embryo transport, endometrial receptivity, endometrial angiogenesis, uterine blood flow and the uterine myometrium.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq033}}</ref>  Some damage is irreversible, but stopping smoking can prevent further damage.<ref name=asrm-risks>[http://www.protectyourfertility.com/femalerisks.html FERTILITY FACT > Female Risks] By the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).

=== Psychological ===
"Smokers often report that cigarettes help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of nonsmokers, adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress. Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal."<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.54.10.817}}</ref>

The deleterious mood effects of abstinence explain why smokers suffer more daily stress than non-smokers, and become less stressed when they quit smoking.

==== Cognitive function ====
{{expert-subject|section|date=September 2012}}

The usage of tobacco can also create cognitive dysfunction. There seems to be an increased risk of [[Alzheimer's disease]], although "case–control and cohort studies produce conflicting results as to the direction of the association between smoking and AD".<ref name="alzheimer-almeida">{{Cite doi|10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00016.x}}</ref> Smoking has been found to contribute to dementia and cognitive decline,<ref name="pmid17573335">{{Cite doi|10.1093/aje/kwm116}}</ref> reduced memory and cognitive abilities in adolescents,<ref name="pmid15607301">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.10.022}}</ref> and brain shrinkage (cerebral atrophy).<ref>{{Cite pmid|14706428}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|9395125}}</ref>

Most notably, some studies have found that patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] are more likely not to have smoked than the general population, which has been interpreted to suggest that smoking offers some protection against Alzheimer's. However, the research in this area is limited and the results are conflicting; some studies show that smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A recent review of the available scientific literature concluded that the apparent decrease in Alzheimer risk may be simply because smokers tend to die before reaching the age at which Alzheimer normally occurs. "Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease," it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as non-smokers to survive to the age of 80.<ref name="alzheimer-almeida" />

Evidence suggests that non-smokers are up to twice as likely as smokers to develop [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/S0166-4328(00)00206-0}}</ref> A plausible explanation for these cases may be the effect of nicotine, a [[cholinergic]] [[stimulant]], increasing the levels of [[acetylcholine]] in the smoker's brain; Parkinson's disease occurs when the effect of [[dopamine]] is less than that of acetylcholine. In addition, nicotine stimulates the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (as do other drugs of abuse), causing an effective increase in dopamine levels. Opponents counter by noting that consumption of pure nicotine may be as beneficial as smoking without the risks associated with smoking, although this is unlikely due to the importance of the MAO-B inhibitor compounds of tobacco in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

[[File:Some toxic components in smoke.png|thumb|Some of the toxic chemical of smoke]]

Smoke, or any partially burnt organic matter, contains [[carcinogen]]s (cancer-causing agents). The potential effects of smoking, such as lung cancer, can take up to 20 years to manifest themselves. Historically, women began smoking ''en masse'' later than men, so an increased death rate caused by smoking amongst women did not appear until later. The male lung cancer death rate decreased in 1975 — roughly 20 years after the initial decline in cigarette consumption in men. A fall in consumption in women also began in 1975<ref>{{cite web|author=Bray F., Tyczynski JE., Parkin DM.|title=Going up or coming down?

Smoke contains several carcinogenic [[pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] products that bind to [[DNA]] and cause [[Mutation|genetic mutation]]s. Particularly potent carcinogens are [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s(PAH), which are [[Toxication|toxicated]] to [[mutagen]]ic [[epoxide]]s. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was [[benzopyrene]], which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits [[programmed cell death]], the cell can survive to become a [[cancer|cancer cell]]. Similarly, [[acrolein]], which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it needs no activation to become carcinogenic.<ref name="Feng">{{Cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0607031103}}</ref>

There are over 19 known carcinogens in cigarette smoke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]]|title=Smoking and smokeless tobacco|url=http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/002032.html|accessdate=July 15, 2006}}</ref> The following are some of the most potent carcinogens:

* '''[[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s''' are [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] components produced by [[pyrolysis]] in smoldering organic matter and emitted into smoke.  Several of these PAH's are already toxic in their normal form, however many of then can become more toxic in the liver. Due to the [[hydrophobic]] nature of PAH's they do not dissolve in water and are hard to expell from the body.  In order to make the PAH more soluble in water, the liver creates an enzyme called [[Cytochrome P450]] which adds an additional [[oxygen]] to the PAH, turning it into a [[mutagen]]ic [[epoxide]]s, which is more souluble, but also more reactive.<ref>http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/91/14/1194.full</ref> The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was '''[[benzopyrene]]''', which been shown to toxicate into a diol epoxide and then permanently attach to nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a [[Mutation|genetic mutation]]. The DNA contains the information on how the cell function; in practice, it contains the recipes for protein synthesis. If the mutation inhibits [[programmed cell death]], the cell can survive to become a [[cancer|cancer cell]], a cell that does not function like a normal cell. The carcinogenity is radiomimetic, i.e. similar to that produced by ionizing nuclear radiation. Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with combustionless [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]] technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes.<ref>{{cite web|title=DNA interaction with Benzopyrene|work=DNA|url=http://www.mybiology.com/chime/dna_benzopyrene/dna_benzopyrene_text.htm|accessdate=March 5, 2005|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20041223072159/http://www.mybiology.com/chime/dna_benzopyrene/dna_benzopyrene_text.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 23, 2004}}</ref> Although such products have become increasingly popular, they still represent a very small fraction of the market, and no conclusive evidence has shown to prove or disprove the positive health claims.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

* '''[[Acrolein]]''' is a pyrolysis product that is abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachromatory effect and is a major contributor to its carcinogenity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base [[guanine]], by a [[Nucleophilic conjugate addition|conjugate addition]] followed by cyclization into a [[hemiaminal]]. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers in a manner similar to PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke, and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a [[mutagen]] and [[carcinogen]] in human cells. The carcinogenity of acrolein has been difficult to study by [[Animal testing|animal experimentation]], because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer.<ref name="Feng"/> Generally, compounds able to react by [[Nucleophilic conjugate addition|conjugate addition]] as [[electrophile]]s (so-called ''Michael acceptors'' after [[Michael reaction]]) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] or [[aflatoxin]]. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, [[crotonaldehyde]] has been found in cigarette smoke.<ref name="Kataoka">{{cite journal  | author = Kataoka H, Sumida A, Makita M | title = Determination of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes in cigarette smoke by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection | year = 1997 | journal = Chromatographia | volume = 44 |issue = 9–10 | pages = 491–6 | doi =10.1007/BF02466742 }}</ref> Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.<ref name="Facchinetti" />
* '''[[Nitrosamine]]s''' are a group of carcinogenic compounds found in cigarette smoke but not in uncured tobacco leaves. Nitrosamines form on flue-cured tobacco leaves during the curing process through a [[chemical reaction]] between nicotine and other compounds contained in the uncured leaf and various oxides of nitrogen found in all combustion gases. Switching to Indirect fire curing has been shown to reduce nitrosamine levels to less than 0.1 parts per million.<ref name="urlwww.caes.uga.edu">{{cite web | url =http://www.caes.uga.edu/departments/bae/extension/pubs/documents/RetrofittingTobaccoCuringBarns.pdf | title = Retrofitting Tobacco Curing Barns | author =  Sumner PE, Moore JM, Boyette MD | work =  Extension Engineering Publications | publisher = The University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences  | accessdate = 2012-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = NOVA | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/cigarette/history2.html | title = Search for a Safer Cigarette | authorlink = Nova (TV series) }}</ref>

Sidestream tobacco smoke, or exhaled mainstream smoke, is particularly harmful. Because exhaled smoke exists at lower temperatures than inhaled smoke, chemical compounds undergo changes which can cause them to become more dangerous. As well, smoke undergoes changes as it ages, which causes the transformation of the compound NO into the more toxic NO2. Further, volatilization causes smoke particles to become smaller, and thus more easily embedded deep into the lung of anyone who later breathes the air.<ref name="isbn1-56670-402-2">{{cite book | author = Godish T | title = Indoor environmental quality | publisher = Lewis Publishers | location = Chelsea, Michigan | year = 2001  | pages = 77–9| isbn = 1-56670-402-2 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=cGlTz8d7j_sC&pg=PA77 }}</ref>

=== Radioactive carcinogens ===
In addition to chemical, nonradioactive carcinogens, tobacco and tobacco smoke contain small amounts of [[lead-210]](<sup>210</sup>Pb) and [[Isotopes of polonium#Polonium-210|polonium-210]] (<sup>210</sup>Po) both of which are radioactive carcinogens. The presence of polonium-210 in mainstream cigarette smoke has been experimentally measured at levels of 0.0263–0.036 [[Curie|pCi]] (0.97–1.33 [[Becquerel|mBq]]),{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/documents/TG/TECHGUID/TG238.pdf|author=[[U.S. Army]] Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine|title=Radiological Sources of Potential Exposure and/or Contamination|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> which is equivalent to about 0.1 pCi per milligram of smoke (4 mBq/mg); or about 0.81 pCi of lead 210 per gram of dry condensed smoke (30 Bq/kg).

Research by [[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR]] [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Edward Martell|Ed Martell]] suggested that radioactive compounds in cigarette smoke are deposited in "hot spots" where [[Bronchus|bronchial tubes]] branch, that tar from cigarette smoke is resistant to dissolving in lung fluid and that radioactive compounds have a great deal of time to undergo [[radioactive decay]] before being cleared by natural processes. Indoors, these radioactive compounds can linger in secondhand smoke, and greater exposure would occur when these radioactive compounds are inhaled during normal breathing, which is deeper and longer than when inhaling cigarettes. Damage to the protective [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissue from smoking only increases the prolonged retention of insoluble polonium 210 compounds produced from burning tobacco. Martell estimated that a carcinogenic radiation dose of 80–100 rads is delivered to the lung tissue of most smokers who die of lung cancer.<ref name="pmid6572389">{{cite journal | author = Martell EA | title = alpha-Radiation dose at bronchial bifurcations of smokers from indoor exposure to radon progeny | journal = Proc.

=== Nicotine ===
[[File:Nicotine-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|Nicotine molecule]]

[[Nicotine]], which is contained in cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products is a [[stimulant]] and is one of the main factors leading to continued tobacco smoking. Although the amount of nicotine inhaled with tobacco smoke is quite small (most of the substance is destroyed by the heat) it is still sufficient to cause physical and/or psychological [[Substance dependence|dependence]]. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. Despite the design of various cigarettes advertised and even tested on machines to deliver less of the toxic tar, studies show that when smoked by humans instead of machines, they deliver the same net amount of smoke. Ingesting a compound by smoking is one of the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to [[Titration|titrate]] their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke free for the rest of their lives.<ref name=NCI_quit>{{cite web | url =http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/cessation | title = Harms of Smoking and Health Benefits of Quitting  | author = National Cancer Institute | date = | format = | work = Fact Sheet | publisher = United States National Institutes of Health | accessdate = 2-12-05-06 }}</ref> There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.<ref name="urlSmoking increases teen depression">{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec00/smoking.html | title = Smoking increases teen depression |author = Smith D | year = 2000 | work = Monitor on Psychology | publisher = American Psychological Association  |accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref>

Although nicotine does play a role in acute episodes of some diseases (including [[stroke]], [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], and [[heart disease]]) by its stimulation of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] release, which raises [[blood pressure]],<ref name="Narkiewicz_2005">{{Cite doi|10.1080/08037050510034202}}</ref> heart and respiration rate, and [[free fatty acids]], respectively. The most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has enabled development of various nicotine delivery systems, such as the [[nicotine patch]] or [[nicotine gum]], that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering nicotine without the harmful combustion by-products. This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health.

[[Nicotine]] is a highly addictive psychoactive chemical. When tobacco is smoked, most of the nicotine is [[Pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]]; a dose sufficient to cause mild somatic dependency and mild to strong psychological dependency remains. There is also a formation of [[Harmala alkaloid|harmane]] (a [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitor]]) from the acetaldehyde in cigarette smoke, which seems to play an important role in nicotine addiction<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.euroneuro.2007.02.013}}</ref> probably by facilitating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to nicotine stimuli. According to studies by Henningfield and Benowitz, nicotine is more addictive than [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[caffeine]], [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]], and [[heroin]] when considering both somatic and psychological dependence. However, due to the stronger withdrawal effects of [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], nicotine may have a lower potential for somatic dependence than these substances.<ref name="urlRelative Addictiveness of Drugs (NYT 8/2/94)">{{cite web | url = http://www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htm | title = Relative Addictiveness of Drugs |author = Hilts PJ | date = 1994-08-02 | publisher = New York Times  | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref><ref name="urlb.rox.com">{{cite web | url = http://b.rox.com/gizmos/henningfield-benowitz/combo.swf | title = The Henningfield-Benowitz substance comparison charts | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | format = | work = |publisher = | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref> About half of Canadians who currently smoke have tried to quit.<ref name="urlHome | Alberta Health Services">{{cite web | url = http://tobacco.aadac.com/about_tobacco/addiction/ | title =  AADAC{{!}}Truth About Tobacco – Addiction  | date = | format = | work = | publisher = Alberta Health Services |accessdate = }}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> [[McGill University]] health professor Jennifer O'Loughlin stated that nicotine addiction can occur as soon as five months after the start of smoking.<ref name="pmid16880445">{{cite journal | author = Gervais A, O'Loughlin J, Meshefedjian G, Bancej C, Tremblay M | title = Milestones in the natural course of onset of cigarette use among adolescents | journal = CMAJ | volume = 175 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–61 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16880445 | pmc = 1513423 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.051235 }}</ref>

Recent evidence has shown that smoking tobacco increases the release of [[dopamine]] in the brain, specifically in the mesolimbic pathway, the same neuro-reward circuit activated by drugs of abuse such as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. This suggests nicotine use has a pleasurable effect that triggers positive reinforcement.<ref name="urlTobacco Addiction | Mind Over Matter | National Institute on Drug Abuse">{{cite web | url =http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/mind-over-matter/tobacco-addiction | title = Mind Over Matter: Tobacco Addiction |author = National Institute on Drug Abuse | publisher = United States National Institutes of Health | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref> One study found that smokers exhibit better reaction-time and memory performance compared to non-smokers, which is consistent with increased activation of dopamine receptors.<ref name="pmid9551774">{{cite journal |author = Parkin C, Fairweather DB, Shamsi Z, Stanley N, Hindmarch I | title = The effects of cigarette smoking on overnight performance | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 136 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–8 | year = 1998 |month = March | pmid = 9551774 | doi =10.1007/s002130050553 }}</ref> Neurologically, rodent studies have found that nicotine self-administration causes lowering of reward thresholds—a finding opposite that of most other drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine and heroin).

== Second-hand smoke ==
{{Main|Passive smoking}}

[[File:Smoking.jpg|300px]]Posted sign to avoid passive smoking in [[York University]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

[[Second-hand]] smoke is a mixture of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe or cigar and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and may cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, [[respiratory tract infection (disambiguation)|respiratory infections]] and [[asthma]].<ref name="ALASecondhandSmokeFactSheet">{{cite web | url = http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/about-smoking/health-effects/secondhand-smoke.html | title = Secondhand Smoke | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | month = June | work = | publisher = American Lung Association | url = http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&b=35422#one | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}</ref> Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work are thought, due to a wide variety of statistical studies, to increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Second-hand smoke has been estimated to cause 38,000 deaths per year, of which 3,400 are deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers.<ref>[http://www.tobaccofreefloridanewsroom.com/?cat=6 "Tobacco-Free Florida", ''Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Fact Sheets'']</ref>

The current US Surgeon General’s Report concludes that there is no established risk-free level of exposure to [[second-hand smoke]]. Short exposures to second-hand smoke are believed to cause blood [[platelets]] to become stickier, damage the lining of [[blood vessel]]s, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. New research indicates that private research conducted by cigarette company [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] in the 1980s showed that second-hand smoke was toxic, yet the company suppressed the finding during the next two decades.<ref name="ALASecondhandSmokeFactSheet" />

A study on hookah smoking and [[cancer]] in [[Pakistan]] was published in 2008. Its objective was  "to find serum [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|CEA]] levels in ever/exclusive hookah smokers, i.e. those who smoked only hookah (no cigarettes, [[Beedi|bidi]]s, etc.), prepared between 1 and 4 times a day with a quantity of up to 120 g of a tobacco-molasses mixture each (i.e. the tobacco weight equivalent of up to 60 cigarettes of 1 g each) and consumed in 1 to 8 sessions". Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker found in several forms of cancer. Levels in exclusive hookah smokers were lower compared to cigarette smokers although the difference was not statistically significant between a hookah smoker and a non-smoker. Also the study concluded that heavy hookah smoking (2–4 daily preparations; 3–8 sessions a day ; >2 hrs to ≤ 6 hours) substantially raises CEA levels.<ref name="pmid18501010">{{cite journal | author = Sajid KM, Chaouachi K, Mahmood R | title = Hookah smoking and cancer: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in exclusive/ever hookah smokers | journal = Harm Reduct J | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 19 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18501010 | pmc = 2438352 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7517-5-19 }}</ref> Hookah smokers were nearly 6-times at risk for development of lung cancer as compared to healthy non-smokers in Kashmir (India).<ref name="pmid21545223">{{cite journal | author = Koul PA, Hajni MR, Sheikh MA, Khan UH, Shah A, Khan Y, Ahangar AG, Tasleem RA | title = Hookah smoking and lung cancer in the Kashmir valley of the Indian subcontinent | journal = Asian Pac.

Hookah in Kashmir has some peculiar features in having a direct contact of the live embers with the burning tobacco thus resulting in high temperatures that augments the production of carcinogenic products from tobacco burning. Additionally water in the hookah base is not changed after every session that renders the water contaminated to a greater degree and thus a possible source of dissolved carcinogens.
