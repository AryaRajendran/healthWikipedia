The '''arcuate uterus''' is a form of a uterine anomaly or variation where the [[uterus|uterine]] fundus displays a concave contour towards the uterine cavity. Normally the fundus of the uterus is straight or convex on anterior-posterior imaging but in the arcuate uterus it dips into the cavity and may form a small septation. The distinction between an arcuate uterus and a [[septate uterus]] is not standardized.

==Etiology==
The uterus is formed during [[embryogenesis]] by the fusion of the two [[mullerian duct]]s. During this fusion a resorption process eliminates the partition between the two ducts to create a single cavity. This process begins caudally and advances cranially, thus an arcuate uterus represents an in the final stage incomplete absorption process.

==Prevalence==
Most studies of [[uterine malformation]]s are based on populations of women who have experienced a [[pregnancy loss]] and thus do not address the issue of the prevalence in the general population. A screening study by Woelfer at al. of women without a history of reproductive problems found that about 5% of women had an arcuate uterus when they defined an arcuate uterus any fundal protrusion into the cavity that had an apical angle of more than 90 degrees. Accodingly it was the most common uterine anomaly, followed by [[septate uterus]] (3%) and [[bicornuate uterus]] (0.5%).<ref name=woelfer>{{cite journal |author=Woelfer B, Salim R, Banerjee S, Elson J, Regan L, Jurkovic D |title=Reproductive outcomes in women with congenital uterine anomalies detected by three-dimensional ultrasound screening |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=1099–103 |year=2001 |doi= 10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01599-X|pmid=11755560|unused_data=<sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AReproductive+outcomes+in+women+with+congenital+uterine+anomalies+detected+by+three-dimensional+ultrasound+screening&as_publication=Obstet+Gynecol&as_ylo=2001&as_yhi=2001&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref>

==Clinical presentation==
The condition may not be known to the affected individual and not result in any reproductive problems; thus normal pregnancies occur.<ref>{{cite book |author=Creasy RK, Resnik R  | title=Maternal-Fetal Medicine: Principles and Practice | publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 1994 | page= 447 |isbn= 0-7216-6590-X}}</ref> Indeed, there is no consensus on the relationship of the arcuate uterus and [[recurrent pregnancy loss]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=ACOG| journal=Practice Bulletin Number 24, 2001, page 3| title=Management of Recurrent Early Pregnancy Loss}}</ref> Accordingly, the condition may be a variation or a pathology.

One view maintains that the condition is associated with a higher risk for [[miscarriage]], [[premature birth]], and [[malpresentation]]. Thus a study that evaluated women with uterine bleeding by hysteroscopy found that 6.5% of subjects displayed the arcuate uterus and had evidence of reproductive impairments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maneschi F, Zupi E, Marconi D, Valli E, Romanini C, Mancuso S |title=Hysteroscopically detected asymptomatic müllerian anomalies.

==Diagnosis==
A pelvic examination will not reveal the condition. Investigations are usually prompted on the basis of reproductive problems.

Helpful techniques to investigate the uterine structure are [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] and [[sonohysterography]], [[hysterosalpingography]], [[MRI]], and [[hysteroscopy]]. More recently 3-D ultrasonography has been advocated as an excellent non-invasive method to delineate the condition.<ref name=woelfer/>

==Management==
Many patients with an arcuate uterus will not experience any reproductive problems and do not require any surgery. In patients with recurrent pregnancy loss thought to be caused by an arcuate uterus hysteroscopic resection can be performed.

==Differential diagnosis==
The major differential diagnosis is the uterine septum. The lack of agreement to separate these two entities makes it difficult to assess the results in the literature.
