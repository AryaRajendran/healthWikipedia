An '''enterolith''' is a mineral [[concretion]] or [[Calculus (medicine)|calculus]] formed anywhere in the [[gastrointestinal system]].  Enteroliths are uncommon and usually incidental findings but, once found, they require at a minimum [[watchful waiting]].  If there is evidence of complications, they must be removed.

{{wiktionary|enterolith|nidus}}
An enterolith may form around a '''nidus''', a small foreign object such as a seed, pebble, or piece of twine, that serves as an irritant.  In this respect, an enterolith forms by a process similar to the [[Pearl#Creation of a pearl|creation of a pearl]].

An enterolith is not to be confused with a [[gastrolith]], which helps digestion.

==In equines==
[[Equine]] enteroliths are found by walking pastures or turning over manure compost piles to find small enteroliths, during [[necroscopy]], and increasingly during surgery for [[colic]].  Therefore, the incidence of asymptomatic enteroliths is unknown.

Equine enteroliths typically are smoothly spherical or tetrahedral,<ref name="Blue1979"/> consist mostly of the mineral [[struvite]]<ref name="Blue1979">{{cite journal

==In humans==
In [[human]]s, enteroliths are rare and may be difficult to distinguish from [[gall stone]]s.  Their chemical composition is diverse, and rarely can a nidus be found.  A [[differential diagnosis]] of an enterolith requires the enterolith, a normal gallbladder, and a [[diverticulum]].<ref>{{cite journal

An enterolith typically forms within a [[diverticulum]].  An enterolith formed in a [[Meckel's diverticulum]] sometimes is known as a Meckel's enterolith.  Improper use of [[magnesium oxide]] as a ''long-term'' [[laxative]] has been reported to cause enteroliths and/or [[Bezoar|medication bezoar]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

Most human enteroliths are radiolucent on plain X-rays.  They sometimes can be visualized on CT scans without contrast;  presence of contrast in the lumen may reveal the enterolith as a void.  Most often, they are visualized using ultrasound.

Although recent surveys of enterolith composition are lacking, one early review notes struvite (as in equines), [[calcium phosphate]], and [[calcium carbonate]] and reports [[choleic acid]].<ref name="Raper1921">{{cite journal

===Treatment===
In simple cases of obstruction, where there are no complications, a variety of non-surgical and surgical techniques are used to remove the enterolith.<ref name="Steenvoorde+2003"/>  These include crushing the enterolith and milking it back to the stomach or forward to the colon, surgical removal via an uninvolved segment of the gastrointestinal tract, and [[Segmental resection|resection]] of the involved segment.
