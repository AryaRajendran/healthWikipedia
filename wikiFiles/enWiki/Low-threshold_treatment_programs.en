'''Low-threshold treatment programs''' are [[harm reduction]] based health care centers targeted towards drug users.<ref name=IslamDay2010>{{cite pmid|20092999 |noedit}}</ref> "Low-threshold" programs are programs that make minimal demands on the patient, offering services without attempting to control their intake of drugs, and providing counselling only if requested. Low-threshold programs may be contrasted with "high-threshold" programs, which require the user to accept a certain level of control and which demand that the patient accept counselling.<ref name=Waal2000>{{cite web|last=Waal|first=Helge|title=Risk reduction as a component of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to drug abuse problems |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/pompidou/Source/AboutUs/TasksStructure/Sintra/SintraWaal_en.pdf |publisher=The Pompidou Group |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>  Low-threshold treatment programs are not to be confused with simple needle exchange programs, and may include comprehensive healthcare and counseling services.<ref name="IslamDay2010"/><ref name=Rogers2004>{{cite doi|10.1186/1477-7517-1-7|noedit}}</ref>

==Background==
[[Drug injection|Injection drug]] users (IDUs) are at risk of a wide range of health problems arising from non-sterile injecting practices, complications of the drug itself or of the lifestyle associated with drug use and dependence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Latt|first=N.; Conigrave, K.; Marshall, J.; Saunders, J.; Marshall, J.; Nutt, D.|title=Addiction Medicine|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199539338|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PsychiatryPsychology/?view=usa&ci=9780199539338}}</ref>  Furthermore, unrelated health problems, such as [[diabetes]], may be neglected because of drug dependence. However, despite their increased health care needs, IDUs do not have the required access to care or may be reluctant to use conventional services.<ref>{{cite pmid|11697611 |noedit}}</ref>  Consequently, their health may deteriorate to a point at which emergency treatment is required,<ref>{{cite journal |author=McDonald, P |title=From streets to sidewalks: developments in primary care services for injecting drug users |journal=Australian Journal of Primary Health |volume=8 |pages=65–69 |year=2002|doi=10.1071/PY02010}}</ref> with considerable costs to both the IDUs and the health system. Accordingly harm reduction based health care centers, also known as ''targeted health care outlet'' or ''low-threshold health care outlet'' for IDUs have been established across a range of settings utilising a variety of models.<ref name="IslamDay2010"/>  These targeted outlets provide integrated, low-threshold services within a harm-reduction framework targeting IDUs, and sometimes include social and/or other services. Where a particular service is not provided, referral and assistance with access is available. In 2007, for example, 33% of all US needle-syringe programs (NSPs) provided on-site medical care, and 7% provided [[buprenorphine]] treatment.<ref>{{cite pmid|19215605|noedit}}</ref>  Similarly, in many European countries NSP outlets serve as low-threshold primary health care centers targeting primarily IDUs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index5778EN.html |title=Low-threshold services |publisher=The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>

==Health care models==
These targeted outlets vary widely and may be either "distributive", providing basic harm reduction services and simple healthcare with facilitated referrals to specialist services, or "one-stop-shops" where a range of services including specialist services are provided onsite. The services being offered by these outlets range from simple needle and syringe provision, to expanded services including basic and preventive primary healthcare, [[hepatitis B]]&nbsp;[[hepatitis A|and&nbsp;A]] vaccinations, [[hepatitis&nbsp;C]] testing, counselling, [[tuberculosis]] screening and sometimes opioid maintenance therapy. Some centers offer hepatitis, HIV treatment and dental care.<ref name=CDC2010>{{cite pmid|21085091 |noedit}}</ref>  The goal of these outlets is to provide: (1) opportunistic health care,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Reid, SE, White, A, Grummett, S, Conigrave, KM and Haber, PS |title=Opportunistic and continuing health care for injecting drug users from a nurse-run needle syringe program-based primary health-care clinic |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |volume=31 |pages=114–115 |year=2012 |pmid=22145983 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x/pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x}}</ref> (2) increased temporal and spatial availability of health care, (3) trustworthy services of health care, (4) cost-effective mode of health care, (5) targeted and tailored services.<ref name=Islam2010>{{cite doi|10.1177/2150131910369684|noedit}}</ref>

In the United States as of 2011, 211 NSPs were known to be operating in 32 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the [[Native Americans in the United States#Current legal status|Indian Nations]].<ref name=amFar2011>{{cite web|title=Syringe Exchange Programs in the United States 2011|url=http://www.amfar.org/uploadedFiles/On_The_Hill/SEPS.pdf?n=3826)|publisher=amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>  The bulk of funding has come from state and local governments,<ref name=CDC2010/> since for most of the last several decades, federal funding for needle exchange programs has been specifically banned.<ref name=HuffPost2012>{{cite news|title=Needle Exchange Programs Lose Federal Funding: Local AIDS Programs Brace For Cuts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/needle-exchange-programs-san-francisco_n_1184420.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post - San Francisco}}</ref> 

Globally, as of 2008, at least 77 countries and territories offer NSPs with varying structures, aims and goals. Some countries use needle exchange services as part of integrated programs to contain drug use, while others aim simply to contain HIV infection as their top priority, considering reduction in incidence of drug use as a much lower priority.<ref name=Cahill2009>{{cite web|title=Syringe exchange programs around the world: The global context|url=http://www.gmhc.org/files/editor/file/gmhc_intl_seps.pdf|publisher=Gay Men's Health Crisis|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>  Acceptance of NSPs vary widely from country to country. On the one hand, in Australia and New Zealand, electronic dispensing machines are available at selected locations such as the Auckland needle exchange and the Christchurch needle exchange, allowing needle exchange service 24 hours to registered users.<ref name=Anderton2002>{{cite web|last=Anderton|first=Jim|title=Needle and syringe exchange programme saves lives|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/15790|publisher=beehive.govt.nz, the official website of the New Zealand Government|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>  On the other hand, over half of the countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa retain the death penalty for drug offenses, although some have not carried out executions in recent years.<ref name=IHRA2011>{{cite web |title=Global State of Harm Reduction 2010|url=http://www.ihra.net/files/2010/06/29/GlobalState2010_Web.pdf |publisher=International Harm Reduction Association|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>

==Evaluation==
Low-threshold programs offering needle exchange have faced much opposition on political and moral grounds.<ref name=Small2010>{{cite doi|10.1186/1477-7517-7-1|noedit}}</ref>  Concerns are often expressed that NSPs may encourage drug use, or may actually increase the number of dirty needles in the community.<ref name=OHRDP>{{cite web|title=Needle Exchange FAQs |url=http://www.ohrdp.ca/resources/needle-exchange-faqs/ |publisher=Ontario Harm Reduction Distribution Program |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>  Another fear is that NSPs may draw drug activity into the communities in which they operate.<ref name=Keyl1998>{{cite pmid|9663629 |noedit}}</ref>  It has also been argued that in fighting disease, needle exchanges take attention away from bigger drug problems, and that, contrary to saving lives, they actually contribute to drug-related deaths.<ref name=Aaron2005>{{cite web|last=Aaron|first=Lawrence|title=Why a Needle-Exchange Program is a Bad Idea |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/221310/why_a_needleexchange_program_is_a_bad_idea/ |publisher=redOrbit.com |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>  Even in Australia, which is considered a leading country in harm reduction,<ref name="Islam2010"/> a survey showed that a third of the public believed that NSPs encouraged drug use, and 20% believed that NSPs dispensed drugs.<ref name=Anex2009>{{cite web|title=Community consulted for the first time on attitudes towards drugs |url=http://www.australiandrugsconference.org.au/2009/downloads/Community%20Consulted%20for%20the%20First%20Time.pdf |publisher=Anex |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>  In the United States, the ambivalent public attitude towards NSPs is often reflected in police interference, with 43% of NSP program managers reporting frequent (at least monthly) client harassment, 31% reporting frequent confiscation of clients' syringes, 12% reporting frequent client arrest, and 26% reporting uninvited police appearances at program sites.<ref name=Beletsky2011>{{cite pmid |21054615 |noedit}}</ref>  A single 1997 study which showed a correlation between frequent program use and elevated rates of HIV infection among IDUs in Vancouver, Canada,<ref name=Strathdee1997>{{cite pmid|9223727 |noedit}}</ref> has become widely cited by opponents of NSPs as demonstrating their counter-productiveness.<ref name=Schechter1999>{{cite pmid |10397556 |noedit}}</ref><ref name=Wood2007>{{cite pmid |17275459 |noedit}}</ref>   

Authors from the 1997 Vancouver study have, in multiple publications, issued disclaimers against the misuse of their work by opponents of NSPs.  They point out that frequent attendees of the program tended to be young and often indulged in extreme high-risk behaviors.  The 1997 results were hence of a statistically biased sampling.<ref name=Schechter1999/><ref name=Wood2007/> They have emphasized that the correct message to be derived from their 1997 study can be read in the title of their work: "Needle exchange is not enough".<ref name=Strathdee1997/>  This is the same message presented by many other articles since.<ref name=CDC2010/><ref name=DesJarlais2011/><ref name=Falster2009>{{cite pmid |18979201 |noedit}}</ref><ref name=Wodak2010/>

Comprehensive, systematic surveys of the costs and effectiveness of low-threshold primary healthcare programs are not available due to the heterogeneity of these programs and the study designs.<ref name=Delgado2004>{{cite pmid |14987217 |noedit}}</ref><ref name=Islam2012>{{cite pmid |21996165 |noedit}}</ref>  Narrower focus studies dealing solely with the needle exchange issue are abundant, however, and generally support the thesis that NSPs reduce the risk of prevalence of HIV, hepatitis and other blood-bourne diseases. These studies suggest that such outlets improve the overall health status of IDUs and save on the health budget by reducing episodes in emergency departments and tertiary hospitals.<ref name=Small2010/><ref name=DesJarlais2011>{{cite pmid |21303233 |noedit}}</ref><ref name=Shriver1998>{{cite pmid |11367470 |noedit}}</ref><ref name=Knittel2010>{{cite pmid |20429944 |noedit}}</ref>  In Australia, monitoring of drug users participating in NSPs showed the incidence of HIV among NSP clients to be essentially identical to that of the general population.<ref name=Wodak2010>{{cite pmid |20513304 |noedit}}</ref><ref name=Topp2011>{{cite pmid |21192232 |noedit}}</ref>  Fears that NSPs may draw drug activity into the communities in which they operate are contradicted by a study that showed that by far the greatest number of clients of an NSP in Chicago came to the area to buy drugs (60%) rather than to exchange needles (3.8%).<ref name=Williams2010>{{cite pmid |20233654 |noedit}}</ref>

Internationally, support for the effectiveness of low-threshold programs including needle exchange have come from studies conducted in Afghanistan,<ref name=Todd2011>{{cite pmid |21867518 |noedit}}</ref> China,<ref name=Zhang2011>{{cite pmid |21507267 |noedit}}</ref> Spain,<ref name=FerrerCastro2012>{{cite pmid |22437903 |noedit}}</ref> Taiwan,<ref name=Lee2012>{{cite pmid |22313534 |noedit}}</ref> Estonia,<ref name=Uuskula2011>{{cite pmid |21718469 |noedit}}</ref> Canada,<ref name=Pinkerton2010>{{cite pmid |20653622 |noedit}}</ref> Iran,<ref name=Zamani2010>{{cite pmid |18483849 |noedit}}</ref> and many other countries. However, in many countries, there is strong opposition to such programs.<ref name=IHRA2011/><ref name=Chatterjee2010>{{cite pmid |20079618|noedit}}</ref><ref name=Ngo2009>{{cite pmid |18242971 |noedit}}</ref> 

Despite the lack of definitive scientific evidence on the effectiveness of IDU-targeted low-threshold services,<ref name=Delgado2004/><ref name=Islam2012/><ref name=Auerbach2008>{{cite pmid |18814374 |noedit}}</ref> the available evidence, revealing barriers to service access and the late presentation of seriously ill IDUs to hospital, suggests the ongoing need for targeted and low-threshold services.  Because of this, organizations ranging from the [[National Institutes of Health]],<ref name=NIH1997>{{cite pmid |9505959 |noedit}}</ref> the [[Centers for Disease Control]],<ref name=CDC2005>{{cite web|title=Syringe Exchange Programs|url=http://www.cdc.gov/idu/facts/aed_idu_syr.pdf|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> the [[American Bar Association]],<ref name=ABA2011>{{cite web|title=ABA Urges Federal Support for Syringe Exchange Programs|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/governmental_affairs_periodicals/washingtonletter/2011/april/syringeexchange.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> the [[American Medical Association]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stapleton|first=Stephanie|title=AMA endorses needle-exchange programs|journal=American Medical News|year=1997}}</ref> the [[American Psychological Association]],<ref name=AmPsych2003>{{cite web|title=Needle Exchange Programs: Position Statement|url=http://www.psych.org/Resources/OfficeofHIVPsychiatry/HIVPolicy/PositionStatementonNeedleExchangePrograms.aspx?FT=.pdf|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> the [[World Health Organization]],<ref name=UNAIDS>{{cite web|title=Drug use and HIV/AIDS|url=http://data.unaids.org/publications/IRC-pub03/una99-1_en.pdf|publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> and many others have endorsed low-threshold programs including needle exchange.
