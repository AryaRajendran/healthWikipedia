The [[heart]] is endowed with specialized excitatory and conducting [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that are responsible for the generation and conduction of [[rhythmic]] [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]s and [[Muscle contraction|contractions]] throughout the heart.  If these cells are damaged by [[disease]], the implantation of an [[artificial pacemaker]] becomes necessary.

==Research==
Despite the successes of [[artificial pacemaker]]s several limitations and problems have emerged during the past decades such as [[electrode]] [[fracture]] or damage to [[insulator (electrical)|insulation]], [[infection]], re-operations for [[battery (electricity)|battery]] exchange and [[venous thrombosis]]. The need for an alternative is most obvious in children, including premature [[Infant|newborn babies]], where size mismatch and the fact that pacemaker leads do not grow with children are a problem.

The first successful experiment with biological pacemakers was carried out by Arjang Ruhparwar's group at [[Hannover Medical School]] in Germany using transplanted [[fetal]] heart [[muscle cells]], first introduced at the scientific sessions of the [[American Heart Association]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] in 2001 and published in 2002.<ref>Ruhparwar A, Tebbenjohanns J, Niehaus M et al. Transplanted fetal cardiomyocytes as cardiac pacemaker. Eur J Cardiothor Surg. 2002; 21: 853-857</ref> A few months later, Eduardo Marban's group from [[Johns Hopkins University]] published the first successful gene-therapeutic approach towards the generation of pacemaking activity in  otherwise non-pacemaking adult [[cardiomyocytes]] using a [[guinea pig]] model.<ref>Miake J, Marban E, Nuss HB. Gene therapy: Biological pacemaker created by gene transfer. Nature 2002; 419: 132-133</ref>  The investigators postulated latent pacemaker capability in normal [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] cells. This potential ability is suppressed by the [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|inward-rectifier potassium current]] Ik1 encoded by the [[gene]] Kir2 which is not expressed in [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker cells]]. By specific inhibition of Ik1 below a certain level, spontaneous activity of cardiomyocytes was observed with resemblance to the action potential pattern of genuine pacemaker cells. Meanwhile other genes and cells have been discovered, including heart muscle cells derived from [[embryonic stem cell]]s, "HCN" genes which encode the [[wild type]] pacemaker current I(f). Michael Rosen's group demonstrated that transplantation of HCN2-transfected human mesenchymal [[stem cell]]s (hMSCs) leads to expression of functional HCN2 channels [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]], mimicking overexpression of HCN2 genes in cardiac [[myocyte]]s.<ref>Plotnikov AN, Sosunov EA, Qu J et al.

==Biological safety==

Until this young field of research finds access to the clinic, the durability and potential ability of transplanted cells or transfected genes to cause arrhythmia must be excluded in long-term studies with [[cardiac mapping]] experiments at various time points and with a large population of animals.
