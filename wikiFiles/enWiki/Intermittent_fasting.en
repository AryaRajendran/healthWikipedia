'''Intermittent fasting''' ('''IF''') is a [[Diet (nutrition)|pattern of eating]] that alternates between periods of [[fasting]] (usually meaning consumption of water and sometimes low-calorie drinks such as black coffee) and non-fasting.

There is evidence suggesting that intermittent fasting may have beneficial effects on the health and [[longevity]] of animals—including [[human]]s—that are similar to the effects of [[caloric restriction]] (CR). There is currently no consensus as to the degree to which this is simply due to fasting or due to an (often) concomitant overall decrease in calories, but recent studies have shown support for the former.<ref name=pmid12724520>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1035720100 |title=Intermittent fasting dissociates beneficial effects of dietary restriction on glucose metabolism and neuronal resistance to injury from calorie intake |year=2003 |last1=Anson |first1=R.

Scientific study of intermittent fasting in rats (and anecdotally in humans) was carried out at least as early as 1943.<ref name = "Anton et al">{{cite journal |pmid=21021020 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21021020 |year=1946 |last1=Carlson |first1=AJ |last2=Hoelzel |first2=F |title=Apparent prolongation of the life span of rats by intermittent fasting |volume=31 |pages=363–75 |journal=The Journal of nutrition}}</ref>

A specific form of intermittent fasting is ''alternate day fasting'' (ADF), also referred to as ''every other day fasting'' (EOD), or ''every other day feeding'' (EODF), a 48-hour routine typically composed of a 24-hour fast followed by a 24-hour non-fasting period.

== Studies ==
=== Animal studies ===
The 1945 study by Carlson and Hoelzel, cited above, found that the apparent life span of rats in the study was increased by intermittent fasting. Tests in which a group of 33 rats were allowed the same food [[ad libitum]] and groups of 37, 37, and 30 rats were fasted one day in four, three, and two days, respectively, after the age of 42 days, showed that the optimum amount of fasting appeared to be fasting one day in three; this increased the life span of littermate males by about 20% and littermate females by about 15%. However, the pre-experimental condition of the individual rats was also found to be an important factor in determining the life spans. No drastic retardation of growth was produced by the intermittent fasting, but the development of mammary tumors was retarded in proportion to the amount of fasting.<ref name = "Anton et al" />

A number of subsequent studies have shown beneficial effects of intermittent fasting in animals:
* "Reduced [[serum glucose]] and [[insulin]] levels and increased resistance of [[neurons]] in the brain to [[excitotoxicity|excitotoxic stress]]."<ref name=pmid12724520/>
* Intermittent fasting was found to "Enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for [[coronary artery disease]] and [[stroke]] including a reduction in [[blood pressure]] and increased [[insulin sensitivity]]" and that "cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents" and that "rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to [[ischemia|ischemic injury]] in experimental models of [[myocardial infarction]] and stroke."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.12.007 |title=Beneficial effects of intermittent fasting and caloric restriction on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems |year=2005 |last1=Mattson |first1=M |last2=Wan |first2=R |journal=The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=129–37 |pmid=15741046}}</ref>

But negative effects of intermittent fasting in animals have also been noted:
* ADF in rats "prolongs life span and promotes numerous health benefits in rodents, including tissue protection from ischemic damage" but also has negative effects including causing "myocardial hypotrophy, cardiac fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and a reduction of cardiac reserve."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cardfail.2010.05.007 |title=Chronic Alternate-Day Fasting Results in Reduced Diastolic Compliance and Diminished Systolic Reserve in Rats |year=2010 |last1=Ahmet |first1=Ismayil |last2=Wan |first2=Ruiqian |last3=Mattson |first3=Mark P. |last4=Lakatta |first4=Edward G. |last5=Talan |first5=Mark I. |journal=Journal of Cardiac Failure |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=843–53 |pmid=20932467 |pmc=2953475}}</ref>

=== Human studies ===
Studies on humans suggest possible benefits:

* Intermittent fasting may function as a form of nutritional [[hormesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.08.004 |title=Dietary factors, hormesis and health |year=2008 |last1=Mattson |first1=Mark P. |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=43–8 |pmid=17913594 |issue=1 |pmc=2253665}}</ref>
* Alternate-day fasting may encourage fat-oxidation.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15640462 |year=2005 |last1=Heilbronn |first1=Leonie K |last2=Smith |first2=Steven R |last3=Martin |first3=Corby K |last4=Anton |first4=Stephen D |last5=Ravussin |first5=Eric |title=Alternate-day fasting in nonobese subjects: Effects on body weight, body composition, and energy metabolism |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=69–73 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15640462}}</ref>
* Alternate-day fasting may reduce body weight, LDL, and triglyceride levels to the same degree regardless of maintenance of low fat or high fat diet on the feeding day.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2012.07.002 |title=Alternate day fasting (ADF) with a high-fat diet produces similar weight loss and cardio-protection as ADF with a low-fat diet |year=2013 |last1=Klempel |first1=Monica C. |last2=Kroeger |first2=Cynthia M. |last3=Varady |first3=Krista A. |journal=Metabolism |volume=62 |pages=137–43 |pmid=22889512 |issue=1}}</ref>

== Human diet ==
A number of individuals are experimenting with different varieties of intermittent fasting as a dietary regimen. In this context, shorthand such as "20/4" is used to denote a repeating pattern of 20 hours of fasting followed by 4 hours of non-fasting. For example, "[[Fast-5 Diet|Fast-5]]" is a book promoting a regimen equivalent to "19/5". Other alternatives include "16/8" and "15/9".

The [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the fasting period may also be specified. Practitioners often start the fasting period at the commencement of nightly [[sleep]].

In common usage, intermittent fasting describes any diet that includes a period of fasting and a period of non-fasting, even if the diet involves consuming a limited amount of calorie-containing beverages such as coffee or tea during the fasting period.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fitnessinsane.com/nutrition/an-introduction-to-intermittent-fasting | title=An Introduction to Intermittent Fasting | accessdate=2012-11-26}}</ref> This contrasts with scientific usage of the term, in which no calories are consumed during the fasting period.

Another variation on intermittent fasting is to consume limited calories (e.g., 20% of normal) rather than none at all on fasting days. This regimen may provide many of the benefits of intermittent fasting.<ref name=pmid16529878/>

Another possibility is eating only one meal per day without caloric restriction. When overall calorie intake is not reduced, this diet worsens some cardiovascular disease risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17413096 |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/4/981.full.pdf |year=2007 |last1=Stote |first1=KS |last2=Baer |first2=DJ |last3=Spears |first3=K |last4=Paul |first4=DR |last5=Harris |first5=GK |last6=Rumpler |first6=WV |last7=Strycula |first7=P |last8=Najjar |first8=SS |last9=Ferrucci |first9=L |title=A controlled trial of reduced meal frequency without caloric restriction in healthy, normal-weight, middle-aged adults |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=981–8 |pmc=2645638 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref>

The BBC2 Horizon documentary Eat, Fast & Live Longer showed another plan: during days of fasting, people eat 400-500 kcal (women) or 500-600 kcal (men), and during feed days, the diet was unrestricted. This was done either alternately (one day fasting, one day feeding) or by fasting two days per week: the [[5:2 diet]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2363162206 |title=Eat, Fast and Live Longer with Michael Mosley |publisher=PBS |date=April 3, 2013}}</ref>
