'''James Braid''' (19 June 1795 – 25 March 1860) was born at Ryelaw House, in the [[St Serf's Inch Priory|parish of Portmoak]], [[Kinross-shire|Kinross]], [[Scotland]].<ref>As a consequence of the straightening and the re-routing of the course of the [[River Leven, Fife]] between 1826 and 1836{{spaced ndash}}the River Leven having been, for many years, the designated boundary between Kinross and Fife{{spaced ndash}}the area known as "The Ryelaw" was officially transferred from the Parish of [[Portmoak]], in the county of Kinross (into which Braid had been born), to the Parish of [[Kinglassie]], in the county of [[Fife]] on 15 May 1891 (41 years after his death).</ref> He was the son of James Braid and Anne Suttie. He married Margaret Mason (or Meason) on 17 November 1813. They had two children, James (born  1822), and a daughter.

A Scottish physician and surgeon, specialising in eye and muscular conditions, Braid was an important and influential pioneer of [[hypnotism]] and [[hypnotherapy]].  Braid adopted the term "hypnotism" as an abbreviation for "neuro-hypnotism" or nervous sleep (that is, sleep of the nerves), in his lectures of 1841-2,<ref name="Braid2">Braid, ''Neurypnology'' (1843), p.2.</ref> and it is from his influential work that others derived the term "hypnosis" in the 1880s.<ref>It is important to recognize that Braid did not, even on a single occasion, use the term '''hypnosis'''</ref>  Braid is regarded by many as the first genuine "hypnotherapist" and the "Father of Modern Hypnotism".<ref>Kroger, W.S. The Practice of Hypnotism, 2000: 3; Robertson (2009)</ref>
{{quotation|“Although Braid believed that hypnotic suggestion was a valuable remedy in functional nervous disorders, he did not regard it as a rival to other forms of treatment, nor wish in any way to separate its practice from that of medicine in general. He held that whoever talked of a "universal remedy" was either a fool or a knave: similar diseases often arose from opposite pathological conditions, and the treatment ought to be varied accordingly. He objected being called a hypnotist; he was, he said, no more a "hypnotic" than a "castor-oil" doctor.” — [[John Milne Bramwell]] (1852–1925)<ref>[http://www.archive.org/stream/hypnotismandtre00bramgoog#page/n217/mode/1up Bramwell, ''Hypnotism and Treatment by Suggestion'', (1910), p.203]</ref>}}

==Background==
{{Hypnosis}}
Braid was apprenticed to [[Leith]] surgeons Charles Anderson (i.e., both the father and the son), and attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1812–1814,<ref>The medical faculty of University of Edinburgh was also the [[alma mater]] of [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]] (1778—1820), [[John Elliotson]] (1791—1868), [[James Esdaile]] (1808-1859), [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] (1813–1885), and [[John Milne Bramwell]] (1852-1925).</ref> where he was also influenced by [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], M.D. (1778–1820), who held the chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh from 1808 to 1820.  Perhaps as a result of his association with Charles Anderson, Braid became a "corresponding" member of the learned society, the [[Wernerian Natural History Society]].<ref>Indicated by the letters "C.M.W.S." in several of Braid's publications.</ref>

He obtained the diploma of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of the City of Edinburgh]], the '''Lic.R.C.S. (Edin)''', in 1815, which entitled him to refer to himself as a Member of the College (i.e., rather than a Fellow).

Braid was appointed surgeon to [[John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun#Children by first marriage|Lord Hopetoun]]'s mines at [[Leadhills]], [[Lanarkshire]], in 1816; and in 1825 he set up in private practice at [[Dumfries]]. One of his patients, Mr. Petty, invited Braid to move his practice to [[Manchester]], [[England]]. Braid moved to Manchester in 1828,<ref>In Manchester he became friends with the English surgeon, [[Daniel Noble (physician)|Daniel Noble]] (1810—1885), who had trained at [[University of St Andrews|the University of St. Andrews in Scotland]], and who lived and conducted his practise in Manchester.</ref> continuing to practise from there until his death in 1860.

==Surgeon==
Braid was a highly skilled and very successful surgeon, educated at Edinburgh University, and a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (M.R.C.S.).

:"[and] though he was best known in the medical world for his theory and practice of hypnotism, he had also obtained wonderfully successful results by operation in cases of [[club foot]] and other deformities, which brought him patients from every part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|kingdom]]. Up to 1841 he had operated on 262 cases of [[Club foot|talipes]], 700 cases of [[strabismus]], and 23 cases of spinal curvature."<ref>Bramwell, ''James Braid: Surgeon and Hypnotist'', p.107.</ref>

==Mesmerism==
Braid became interested in the [[phenomenon]] known as [[mesmerism]] in November 1841, when he personally observed demonstrations given by the traveling Swiss mesmerist [[Charles Lafontaine]] (1803–1892).<ref name="Braid2" />
In particular, he examined the physical condition of Lafontaine's mesmerized subjects and concluded that they were, indeed, in quite a different physical state. Upon reflection, he became convinced that he had discovered the natural [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] mechanism underlying these quite genuine phenomena, and he immediately delivered a series of five public lectures in Manchester that commenced on 27 November 1841.<ref name="Braid2" />

==Hypnotism==
Within a few days following his observation of Lafontaine, in November 1841, Braid began experimenting with his own method, and soon began giving public lectures.

In early 1842 — as a response to a personal attack upon himself and his work that had been made in a sermon delivered by a Manchester cleric, [[Hugh McNeile|M‘Neile]], and had been published a few days later in an unaltered form, despite Braid's attempts to rectify the misunderstandings he felt it contained — Braid privately published the contents of an (unanswered) letter that he had written to the cleric as a twelve page booklet entitled ''Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed'' (Braid, 1842).

Soon after, he also wrote a report entitled "Practical Essay on the Curative Agency of Neuro-Hypnotism", which he applied to have read before the [[British Science Association|British Association]] in June 1842.  Despite being initially accepted for presentation, the paper was controversially rejected at the last moment; but Braid arranged for a series of [[Conversazione]]s [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conversazione] at which he presented its contents.<ref name="Braid2" />

"Braid later changed his sleep-based physiological theory to a psychological one which emphasized mental concentration on a single idea, giving this the name of monoideism in 1847".<ref>Gravitz & Gerton (1984), p.108, citing Braid's ''Physiology of Fascination'' as their source.</ref> Braid summarized and contrasted his own view with the other views prevailing at that time.

:"The various theories at present entertained regarding the phenomena of mesmerism may be arranged thus:— First, those who believe them to be owing entirely to a system of collusion and delusion; and a great majority of society may be ranked under this head. Second, those who believe them to be real phenomena, but produced solely by imagination, sympathy, and imitation. Third, the animal magnetists, or those who believe in some magnetic medium set in motion as the exciting cause of the mesmeric phenomena. Fourth, those who have adopted my views, that the phenomena are solely attributable to a peculiar physiological state of the brain and the spinal cord."<ref>Tinterow (1970), p.320.</ref>

==Terminology==
In this booklet,<ref>Braid, J.  "Satanic Agency and Mesmerism” Reviewed, in a letter to the Rev. H. McNeile, A.M., in Reply to a Sermon preached him (1842).</ref> Braid uses the terms "neurohypnotism", "hypnotic", and "neurohypnology", perhaps for the first time (rather than in his 1843 work, ''Neurypnology'', as is often asserted).  However, he seems to have used "Neuro-Hypnotism" in the title of his unpublished report rejected by the British Association, and read at his own public lectures, as early as November or December 1841.

Although Braid was the first to use the terms ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[Hypnosis|hypnotize]]'' and ''[[hypnotist]]'' in English, the [[cognate]] terms '''''hypnotique''''', '''''hypnotisme''''', '''''hypnotiste''''' had been intentionally used by the French magnetist Baron [[Etienne Félix d'Henin de Cuvillers]] (1755–1841) at least as early as 1820.<ref>Gravitz & Gerton (1984), p.109.</ref>  Braid, moreover, was the first person to use "hypnotism" in its modern sense, referring to a "psycho-physiological" theory rather than the "occult" theories of the magnetists.

In a letter written to the editor of [[The Lancet]] in 1845, Braid emphatically states that:
:"I adopted<ref>Note the very specific and unequivocal use of the term '''''adopted''''', rather than the term "coined" used by later commentators on Braid.</ref> the term "hypnotism" to prevent my being confounded with those who entertain those extreme notions [sc. that a mesmeriser's ''will'' has an "irresistible power… over his subjects" and that [[clairvoyance]] and other "higher phenomena" are routinely manifested by those in the mesmeric state], as well as to get rid of the erroneous theory about a magnetic fluid, or '''exoteric influence of any description being the cause of the sleep'''. I distinctly avowed that '''hypnotism''' laid no claim to produce any phenomena which were not "quite reconcilable with well-established physiological and psychological principles"; pointed out the various sources of fallacy which might have misled the mesmerists; [and] was the first to give a public explanation of the trick [by which a fraudulent subject had been able to deceive his mesmerizer]…
:[Further, I have '''never''' been] a supporter of the '''imagination theory''' — i.e., that the induction of [hypnosis] in the '''first''' instance is merely the result of imagination. My belief is quite the contrary. I attribute it to the induction of a habit of intense abstraction, or concentration of attention, and maintain that it is most readily induced by causing the patient to fix his thoughts and sight on an object, and suppress his respiration.

==Induction==
In his first publication, he had also stressed the importance of the subject concentrating both vision '''and''' thought, referring to "the continued fixation of the mental and visual eye"<ref>The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s '''''mentis oculi'''''.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&dq=mentis-oculi%20%20Cicero%20de-Oratore&pg=RA1-PT491#v=onepage&q=&f=false] The concept of the mind's eye first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his [[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]], where he speaks of a man "who was blind, and could only see with the eyes of his mind, with which all men see after they go blind".[http://www.librarius.com/canttran/manlawtr/manlawtale533-581.htm Line 551]</ref> as a means of engaging a natural physiological mechanism that was already ''hard-wired'' into each human being:
:"I shall merely add, that my experiments go to prove that it is a law in the animal economy that, by the continued fixation of the mental and visual eye on any object in itself not of an exciting nature, with absolute repose of body and general quietude, they become wearied; and, provided the patients rather favour than resist the feeling of stupor which they feel creeping over them during such experiment, a state of somnolency is induced, and that peculiar state of brain, and mobility of the nervous system, which render the patient liable to be directed so as to manifest the mesmeric phenomena. I consider it not so much the optic, as the motor and sympathetic nerves, and the mind, through which the impression is made. Such is the position I assume; and I feel so thoroughly convinced that it is a law of the animal economy, that such effects should follow such condition of mind and body, that I fear not to state, as my deliberate opinion, that this is a fact which cannot be controverted."<ref>Braid, ''Satanic Agency'', Tinterow (1970), p.321.</ref>

In 1843 he published ''Neurypnology; or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep'' '''''Considered in Relation with Animal Magnetism…''''', his first and only book-length exposition of his views. According to Bramwell (1896, p.&nbsp;91) the work was popular from the outset, selling 800 copies within a few months of its publication.

Braid thought of hypnotism as producing a "nervous sleep" which differed from ordinary sleep.  The most efficient way to produce it was through visual fixation on a small bright object held eighteen inches above and in front of the eyes. Braid regarded the physiological condition underlying hypnotism to be the over-exercising of the eye muscles through the straining of attention.

He completely rejected [[Franz Mesmer]]'s idea that a [[magnetism|magnetic]] fluid caused hypnotic phenomena, because anyone could produce them in "himself by attending strictly to the simple rules" that he had laid down. ''Braidism'' is a synonym for hypnotism, though it is used infrequently.

==Death==
Braid maintained an active interest in hypnotism until his death.

{{quotation|"I consider the hypnotic mode of treating certain disorders is a most important ascertained fact, and a real solid addition to practical therapeutics, for there is a variety of cases in which it is really most successful, and to which it is most particularly adapted; and those are the very cases in which ordinary medical means are least successful, or altogether unavailing. Still, I repudiate the notion of holding up hypnotism as a panacaea or universal remedy. As formerly remarked, I use ''hypnotism ALONE only in a certain class of cases'', to which I consider it peculiarly adapted — and I use it ''in conjunction with medical treatment, in some other cases''; but, ''in the great majority of cases, I do not use hypnotism at all'', but depend entirely upon the efficacy of medical, moral, dietetic, and hygienic treatment, prescribing active medicines in such doses as are calculated to produce obvious effects" — James Braid<ref>Braid, ''Magic, Witchcraft, Animal Magnetism, Hypnotism, and Electro-Biology, etc.'', (1852), pp.90-91 (emphasis in the original). [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6CMCAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA90&dq=james-braid+I+consider+the+hypnotic+mode+of+treating+certain+disorders+is+a+most+important+ascertained+fact&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false]</ref>}}

Just three days before his death he sent a (now lost) manuscript, written in English,''On hypnotism'', to the French surgeon [[Étienne Eugène Azam]].<ref>Preyer, ''Die Entdeckung des Hypnotismus'' (1881), pp.61-62; Bramwell, ''Hypnotism'' (1913), p.29.</ref>

Braid died on 25 March 1860, in Manchester, after just a few hours of illness. According to some contemporary accounts he died from "[[apoplexy]]", and according to others he died from "[[heart disease]]".<ref>Bramwell, ''Hypnotism'' (1913), p.29.</ref> He was survived by his wife, his son James (a general practitioner, rather than a surgeon), and his daughter.

==Influence==
{{pquote|It was due to the researches of Braid that hypnosis was placed on a scientific basis, and his coining and application of the terms hypnotism and hypnosis [''sic''., Braid never used "hypnosis"] to the phenomenon instead of the misnomer of Mesmerism facilitated its acceptance by the medical profession.  In the course of his investigations Braid reached the conclusion that hypnotism was wholly a matter of suggestion, which constituted the first attempt at a scientific and psychological explanation.  He made a detailed study of the technique of hypnosis and the various phenomena obtained in trances.  He was a prolific writer and left extensive treatises which are surprisingly modern in their conceptions. — [[Milton H. Erickson]] <ref>Erickson, M.H. ‘Historical Sketch’, ''Medical Record'', December 5, 1934.</ref>}}
Braid’s work had a strong influence on a number of important French medical figures, especially [[Étienne Eugène Azam]] (1822–1899) of [[Bordeaux]] (Braid’s principal French “disciple”), the anatomist [[Paul Broca|Pierre Paul Broca]] (1824–1880),<ref>According to a lengthy report (dated 16 December 1859), "''Hypnotism — Important Medical Discovery''" from the anonymous "Paris correspondent" of the ''New York Herald'', in the Thursday, 5 January 1860 edition of the ''Herald'' (p.5), Azam had introduced Braid's techniques to Broca; and Broca subsequently performed a number of operations using Braid's hypnotic techniques (i.e., rather than using [[mesmerism]] as [[James Esdaile|Esdaile]] had done) for anaesthesia, and the eminent French surgeon, [[Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau|Velpeau]] (1795-1867) was so impressed that he read a paper on Broca's experiments to the French Academy of Sciences on Broca's behalf.</ref> the physiologist [[Joseph Pierre Durand de Gros]] (1826–1901), and the eminent hypnotherapist and co-founder of the [[Nancy School]] [[Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault]] (1823–1904).

Braid hypnotised the English Swedenborgian writer Dr. [[James John Garth Wilkinson|J.J.G. Wilkinson]], who observed him hypnotising others several times, and began using hypnotism himself.  Wilkinson soon became a passionate advocate of Braid's work and his published remarks on hypnotism were quoted enthusiastically by Braid several times in his later writings.  However, Braid's legacy was maintained in Great Britain largely by Dr. [[John Milne Bramwell]] who collected all of his available works, and published a biography and account of Braid's theory and practice, as well as several books of his own on hypnotism.

==James Braid Society==
In 1997 Braid’s part in developing hypnosis for therapeutic purposes was recognized and commemorated by the creation of the James Braid Society,[http://www.jamesbraidsociety.com] a discussion group for those “involved or concerned in the ethical uses of hypnosis.”  The society meets once a month in central London, usually for a presentation on some aspect of hypnotherapy.

==Works==
James Braid published many letters and articles and several small books and booklets.  His first major publication was ''Neurypnology, or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep'' (1843), written less than two years after his discovery of hypnotism.  However, Braid continually revised his theory and practice and carried out many, albeit primitive, experiments on hypnosis.

In April 2009, Robertson published a reconstructed English version, backward translated from the French, of Braid's last (lost) manuscript (''On Hypnotism''), addressed by Braid to the French Academy of Sciences.

Apart from ''Neurypnology'', his first book, all of Braid's works have been out of print since his death; however, many are now available on-line (see links at '''Further reading''', below). The 2009 publication of Robertson (''Discovery of Hypnosis'') contains all of Braid's major works and many letters and articles by him, including "On Hypnotism".
