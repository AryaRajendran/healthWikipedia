'''Maurice Ralph Hilleman''' (August 30, 1919 – April 11, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[microbiologist]] who specialized in [[vaccinology]] and developed over 36 [[vaccine]]s, more than any other scientist.  Of the 14 vaccines routinely recommended in current [[vaccine schedule]]s, he developed eight:  those for [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[chickenpox]], [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' bacteria.<ref name=Vaccinated>{{cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 }}</ref> He also played a role in the discovery of the [[common cold|cold]]-producing [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]], the hepatitis viruses, and the [[cancer]]-causing virus [[SV40]].

He is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century.<ref name=Maugh>{{cite news |title= Maurice R.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Hilleman was born on a farm near the [[Great Plains|high plains]] town of [[Miles City, Montana]].  His parents were Anna and Gustav Hillemann, and he was their eighth child.  His twin sister died when he was born, and his mother died two days later.  He was raised in the nearby household of his uncle, Robert Hilleman, and worked in his youth on the family farm.  He credited much of his success to his work with [[chicken]]s as a boy; chicken eggs are often used to develop vaccines based on weakened viruses.

His family belonged to the Missouri Synod [[Lutheran Church]]. When he was in the eighth grade, he discovered [[Charles Darwin]], and was caught reading ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in church. Later in life he rejected religion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maurice Hilleman|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maurice-hilleman-6147948.html|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=20 April 2005|}}</ref> Due to lack of money, he almost failed to attend college.  His eldest brother interceded, and Hilleman graduated first in his class from [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]] with family help and scholarships.  He won a fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]] and received his doctoral degree in microbiology in 1941.  His doctoral thesis was on [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], which was then thought to be caused by a virus.  Hilleman showed that the disease was in fact caused by [[Chlamydia trachomatis|an unusual bacteria]] which grew only inside of cells.

===Career===
After joining E.R. Squibb & Sons (now [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]), Hilleman developed a vaccine against [[Japanese B encephalitis]], a disease that threatened American troops in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]].  As chief of the Department of Respiratory Diseases at [[Army Medical School|Army Medical Center]] (now the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]) from 1948 to 1958, Hilleman discovered the genetic changes that occur when the [[influenza]] virus [[Mutation|mutates]], known as ''shift and [[Genetic drift|drift]]''.  That helped him to recognize that an outbreak of flu in [[Hong Kong]] could become a huge [[pandemic]].  Working on a hunch, he and a colleague found (after nine 14-hour days) that it was a new strain of flu that could kill millions.  Forty million doses of vaccines were prepared and distributed.  Although 69,000 Americans died, the [[pandemic]] could have resulted in many more US deaths.  Hilleman was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal]]{{dn|date=October 2012}} from the American military for his work.

In 1957, Hilleman joined [[Merck & Co.]] ([[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey]]), as head of its new [[virus]] and [[cell biology]] research department in [[West Point, Pennsylvania]].  It was while with Merck that Hilleman developed most of the forty experimental and licensed animal and human vaccines he is credited with, working both at the laboratory bench as well as providing scientific leadership.

In 1963, his daughter Jeryl Lynn came down with the [[mumps]].  He cultivated material from her, and used it as the basis of a [[mumps vaccine]].  The [[Jeryl Lynn]] strain of the [[Mumpsvax|mumps vaccine]] is still used today.  The strain is currently used in the trivalent (measles, mumps and rubella) [[MMR vaccine]] that he also developed, the first vaccine ever approved incorporating multiple live virus strains.

He and his group invented<ref>Offit, ch 8</ref> a vaccine for [[Hepatitis B]] by treating blood serum with [[pepsin]], [[urea]] and [[formaldehyde]].  This was licensed in 1981, but withdrawn in 1986 in the US when it was replaced by a vaccine that was produced in yeast.  This vaccine is still in use today.  By 2003 150 countries were using it and the incidence of the disease in the US in young people had decreased by 95%. Hilleman considered his work on this vaccine to be his single greatest achievement.  

Hilleman was one of the early vaccine pioneers to warn about the possibility that simian viruses might contaminate vaccines.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bookchin D, Schumacher J |title=The Virus and the Vaccine |pages=94–98 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-312-27872-1 }}</ref> The best-known of these viruses became [[SV40]], a viral contaminant of the polio vaccine, whose discovery led to the recall of [[Jonas Salk|Salk]]'s vaccine in 1961 and its replacement with [[Albert Sabin]]'s oral vaccine.  The contamination actually occurred in both vaccines at very low levels, and, because they were ingested rather than injected, did not result in infections or any harm.

Hilleman served on numerous national and international advisory boards and committees, academic, governmental and private, including the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Office of AIDS Research Program Evaluation and the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] of the [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases|National Immunization Program]].  In his later life, Hilleman was an adviser to the [[World Health Organization]].  He retired as senior vice president of the Merck Research Labs in 1984 at the mandatory retirement age of 65.  He then directed the newly created Merck Institute for Vaccinology where he worked for the next twenty years.

At the time of his death on April 11, 2005, at the age of 85, Hilleman was Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia.

==Method and personality==
Hilleman was a forceful man who was at the same time modest in his claims.  None of his vaccines or discoveries are named after him.  He ran his laboratory like a military unit, and he was the one in command.  He terminated every subordinate that did not measure up to his standards.  For a time he kept a row of "shrunken heads" (actually fakes made by one of his children) in his office as trophies that represented each of his fired employees.  He used profanity and tirades freely to drive his arguments home, and once, famously, refused to attend a mandatory "charm school" course intended to make Merck middle managers more civil.  His men were fiercely loyal to him.<ref>Offit p128-131</ref>

==Recognition==
Hilleman was an elected member of the US [[National Academy of Science]], the [[Institute of Medicine]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]].  In 1988 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] presented him with the [[National Medal of Science]], the nation's highest scientific honor.  He received the [[Prince Mahidol Award]] from the [[King of Thailand]] for the advancement of public health, as well as a special lifetime achievement award from the [[World Health Organization]], the [[Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service]] and the [[Sabin Gold Medal]] and Lifetime Achievement Awards.

In March 2005 the [[University of Pennsylvania]] School of Medicine's Department of [[Pediatrics]] and The [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]], in collaboration with The Merck Company Foundation, announced the creation of The Maurice R. Hilleman Chair in Vaccinology.

[[Robert Gallo]], co-discoverer of the virus that causes AIDS, once said "If I had to name a person who has done more for the benefit of human health, with less recognition than anyone else, it would be Maurice Hilleman.  Maurice should be recognized as the most successful vaccinologist in history."<ref>Maugh</ref>

After Hilleman's death [[Ralph Nader]] wrote, "Yet almost no one knew about him, saw him on television, or read about him in newspapers or magazines. His anonymity, in comparison with Madonna, Michael Jackson, Jose Canseco, or an assortment of grade B actors, tells something about our society's and media's concepts of celebrity; much less of the heroic."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://counterpunch.org/nader04162005.html |accessdate=2009-11-13 |date=2005-04-16 |author=Nader R |title=Scientists or celebrities? |work=Counterpunch }}</ref>

In 2007, [[Paul Offit]] published a biography of Hilleman, entitled ''Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases''.<ref name=Vaccinated/>

On October 15, 2008, Merck named its [[Durham, North Carolina]] vaccine manufacturing facility in memory of Hilleman.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Merck & Co., Inc., dedicates Durham vaccine manufacturing facility in honor of Merck scientist Maurice R.
