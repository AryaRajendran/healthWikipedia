==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of IC/BPS are often misdiagnosed as a "common" bladder infection ([[cystitis]]) or a UTI.  However, IC/BPS has not been shown to be caused by a [[bacterial infection]] and [[antibiotics]] are an ineffective treatment. The symptoms of IC/BPS may also initially be attributed to [[prostatitis]] and [[epididymitis]] (in men) and [[endometriosis]] and [[uterine fibroids]] (in women).

The most common symptoms of IC/BPS are pain, frequency, [[dyspareunia|painful sexual intercourse]],<ref name="PubMed"/> and nocturia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ustinova |first1=EE |last2=Fraser |first2=MO |last3=Pezzone |first3=MA |title=Cross-Talk and Sensitization of Bladder Afferent Nerves |journal=Neurourology Urodynamics |volume=29|issue=1 |pages=77–81 |year=2011|pmid=20025032|doi=10.1002/nau.20817}}</ref>

In general, symptoms are:<ref name="Enigma"/>
* [[Painful urination]]
** Pain that is worsened with bladder filling and/or improved with urination.
** Pain that is worsened with a certain food or drink.
** Some patients report [[dysuria]] (burning sensation in the urethra when urinating).
* Urinary frequency (as often as every 10&nbsp;minutes), urgency, and pressure in the bladder and/or pelvis.
* Some patients report nocturia (waking at night to urinate), [[urinary hesitancy]] (needing to wait for the stream to begin, often caused by [[pelvic floor dysfunction]] and tension), pain with [[sexual intercourse]], and discomfort and difficulty driving, travelling or working.

During [[cystoscopy]], 5-10% of patients are found to have [[Hunner's ulcer]]s.<ref name="IC section of the NKUDIC"/>  Patients may have discomfort only in their [[urethra]], while others struggle with pain in the entire pelvis. Interstitial cystitis patients often exhibit their symptoms in one of two patterns: significant [[Hypogastrium|suprapubic]] pain with little frequency or a lesser amount of suprapubic pain but with increased urinary frequency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Dr. Jill|title="Interstitial Cystitis" Paul Perry, MD, Chairman, Obgyn.Net Editorial Advisory Board, Chronic Pelvic Pain interviews Jill Peters, MD|url= http://www.obgyn.net/avtranscripts/perry_peters.htm|work=OBGYN.net|publisher=Obgyn.Net Conference Coverage from International Pelvic Pain Society&nbsp;— Simsbury Connecticut&nbsp;— April/May, 1999|accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref>

===Association with other conditions===
Some people with IC/BPS suffer from other conditions that may have the same etiology as IC/BPS. These include: [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), [[fibromyalgia]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], endometriosis,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Butrick |first1=CW|title=Patients with Chronic Pelvic Pain: Endometriosis or Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome?|journal=Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons |volume=11|issue=2 |pages=182–189 |year=2007 |pmid=17761077}}</ref> [[vulvodynia]], [[Multiple chemical sensitivity|chemical sensitivities]],<ref name="Enigma"/> [[allergies]], [[Sjogren's syndrome]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]], and [[anxiety disorder]].<ref name="phenotype">{{cite journal |last1=Dimitrakov |first1=J |last2=Guthrie |first2=D|title=Genetics and Phenotyping of Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome|journal=Journal of Urology |volume=181 |issue=4 |pages=1550–1557 |year=2009 |pmid=19230927|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2008.11.119}}</ref> In addition, men with IC/PBS are frequently diagnosed as having [[chronic nonbacterial prostatitis]], and there is an extensive overlap of symptoms and treatment between the two conditions, leading researchers to posit that the conditions may share the same etiology and pathology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001551/ |title=Prostatitis-nonbacterial-chronic |author=PubMed Health |year=2011 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>

==Causes==
The cause of IC/BPS is currently unknown.<ref name="PubMed">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001508/ |title=Interstitial Cystitis |author=Pubmed Health |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> However, several explanations have been proposed and include: autoimmune theory, nerve theory, mast cell theory, leaky lining theory, infection theory, and a theory of production of a toxic substance in the urine. Other suggested etiological causes are [[neurologic]], [[allergic]], [[genetics|genetic]], and [[stress (biology)|stress]]-psychological.<ref name="IC section of the NKUDIC">{{cite web |url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/interstitialcystitis/ |title=Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome |author=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eric S.|first=Rovner, MD|title=Interstitial Cystitis: Etiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/441831-overview#a0102|publisher=MedScape Reference|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mdconversation.com/mdconJrun/en/welcome/pres/v2v7/indextables.html?meetingName=hb_spndrsticp0702|title=Understanding Interstitial Cystitis|publisher=MD Conversation / peer-reviewed|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>   In addition, recent research shows that IC patients may have a substance in the urine that inhibits the growth of cells in the bladder epithelium.<ref name="phenotype"/> An infection may then predispose those patients to develop IC. Current evidence from clinical and laboratory studies confirms that mast cells play a central role in IC/PBS possible due to their ability to release histamine and cause pain, swelling, scarring, and interfere with healing.<ref name="pain"/> Research has shown that there is a proliferation of nerve fibers present in the bladders of IC patients which is absent in the bladders of people who have not been diagnosed with IC.<ref name="Enigma"/>

Regardless of the origin, it is clear that the majority of IC/BPS patients struggle with a damaged [[urothelium]], or bladder lining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/interstitial-cystitis/DS00497/DSECTION=causes|title=Causes |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> When the surface [[glycosaminoglycan]] (GAG) layer is damaged (via a urinary tract infection (UTI), excessive consumption of [[coffee]] or [[Soft drink|sodas]], traumatic injury, etc.), urinary chemicals can "leak" into surrounding tissues, causing pain, inflammation, and urinary symptoms. Oral medications like [[pentosan polysulfate]] and medications that are placed directly into the bladder via a [[catheter]] sometimes work to repair and rebuild this damaged/wounded lining, allowing for a reduction in symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=VR |last2=Perry |first2=CM |title=Pentosan polysulfate: a review of its use in the relief of bladder pain or discomfort in interstitial cystitis. |journal=Drugs |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=821–835 |year=2006 |pmid=16706553}}</ref> Most literature supports the belief that IC's symptoms are associated with a defect in the bladder epithelium lining allows irritating substances in the urine to penetrate into the bladder&nbsp;— essentially, a breakdown of the bladder lining (also known as Adherence Theory).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome: Symptom recognition is key to early identification, treatment|journal=CCleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine|year=2007|month=May|volume=74|series=S54-S62|issue=3|url=http://www.auanet.org/eforms/elearning/core/topics/fpm-ngb-incont/cystitis-pps/assets/CLEVELAND-Interstitial%20cystitis-painful%20bladder%20syndrome.pdf}}</ref> Deficiency in this glycosaminoglycan layer on the surface of the bladder results in increased permeability of the underlying submucosal tissues.<ref name="Enigma"/>

GP51 has been identified as a possible urinary biomarker for IC with significant variations in GP51 levels in IC patients when compared to individuals without interstitial cystitis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Teichman|first1=JMH|title=The Role of Pentosan Polysulfate in Treatment Approaches for Interstitial Cystitis |journal=Reviews in Urology|year=2002|volume=4|issue=Supplement 1|pages=S21-S27|pmid=16986030}}</ref>

Numerous studies have noted the link between IC, anxiety, stress, hyperresponsiveness, and panic.<ref name="phenotype"/> Another proposed etiology for interstitial cystitis is that the body's immune system attacks the bladder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adult Conditions / Bladder / Interstitial Cystitis|url=http://www.urologyhealth.org/adult/index.cfm?cat=03&topic=210|publisher=American Urological Association Foundation|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> Biopsies on the bladder walls of people with IC usually contain mast cells.  Mast cell containing [[histamine]] packets  gather when an allergic reaction is occurring. The body identifies the bladder wall as a foreign agent, and the histamine packets burst open and attack.  The body attacks itself, which is the basis of autoimmune disorders.<ref name="Kavaler">{{cite book|last=Kavaler|first=Elizabeth|title=A seat on the aisle, please!: the essential guide to urinary tract problems|publisher=Springer: The Language of Science|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_0IAIZZiH_MC&lpg=PA284&dq=autoimmune%20theory%2C%20%22interstitial%20cystitis%22&pg=PA284#v=onepage&q=autoimmune%20theory,%20%22interstitial%20cystitis%22&f=false|isbn=978-0-387-95509-4|date=30 June 2006}}</ref> Additionally, the idea has been put forward that IC is triggered by an unknown toxin or stimulus which causes nerves in the bladder wall to fire uncontrollably. When they fire, they release substances called [[neuropeptides]] that induce a cascade of reactions that cause pain in the bladder wall.<ref name="pain"/>

===Genes===
Some genetic subtypes, in some patients, have been linked to the disorder.
* An antiproliferative factor secreted by the bladders of IC/BPS patients which  inhibits bladder cell proliferation, thus possibly causing the missing bladder lining.<ref name="Enigma"/><ref name="phenotype"/>

* PAND, at gene map locus 13q22-q32, is associated with a constellation of disorders (a "[[pleiotropic]] syndrome") including IC/BPS and other bladder and kidney problems, thyroid diseases, serious headaches/migraines, [[panic disorder]], and [[mitral valve prolapse]].<ref name="phenotype"/>

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of IC/BPS is one of exclusion, as well as a review of clinical symptoms. The AUA Guidelines recommend starting with a careful patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests to assess and document symptoms of IC, as well as other potential disorders.[4]

The [[potassium chloride|KCl]] test, also known as the ''potassium sensitivity test'', is no longer recommended.[4] The test uses a mild [[potassium]] solution to evaluate the integrity of the bladder wall.<ref name="Enigma"/> Though the latter is not specific for IC/BPS, it has been determined to be helpful in predicting the use of compounds, such as [[pentosan polysulphate]], which are designed to help repair the GAG layer. 

For complicated cases, the use of [[hydrodistention]] with cystoscopy may be helpul.[4] Researchers, however, determined that this visual examination of the bladder wall after stretching the bladder was not specific for IC/BPS<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacDiarmid |first1=SA |last2=Sand |first2=PK |title=Diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome in Patients With Overactive Bladder Symptoms |journal=Reviews in Urology |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=9–16 |year=2007|pmid=17396167}}</ref> and that the test, itself, can contribute to the development of small [[glomerulation]]s ([[petechial]] hemorrhages) often found in IC/BPS. Thus, a diagnosis of IC/BPS is one of exclusion, as well as a review of clinical symptoms.

In 2006, the ESSIC society proposed more rigorous and demanding diagnostic methods with specific classification criteria so that it cannot be confused with other, similar conditions. Specifically, they require that a patient must have pain associated with the bladder, accompanied by one other urinary symptom. Thus, a patient with just frequency or urgency would be excluded from a diagnosis. Secondly, they strongly encourage the exclusion of confusable diseases through an extensive and expensive series of tests including (A) a [[medical history]] and [[Physical examination|physical exam]], (B) a dipstick [[urinalysis]], various urine cultures, and a serum [[Prostate Specific Antigen|PSA]] in men over 40, (C) flowmetry and post-void residual urine volume by [[ultrasound scan]]ning and (D) cystoscopy. A diagnosis of IC/BPS would be confirmed with a hydrodistention during cystoscopy with biopsy.

They also propose a ranking system based upon the physical findings in the bladder.<ref name="Enigma"/> Patients would receive a numeric and letter based score based upon the severity of their disease as found during the hydrodistention. A score of 1-3 would relate to the severity of the disease and a rating of A-C represents biopsy findings. Thus, a patient with 1A would have very mild symptoms and disease while a patient with 3C would have the worst available symptoms.

In 2009, Japanese researchers identified a urinary marker called [[phenylacetylglutamine]] that could be used for early diagnosis.<ref name="Fukui-2009">{{cite journal |last1=Fukui |first1=Yousuke |last2=Kato |first2=Masao |last3=Inoue |first3=Yohji |last4=Matsubara |first4=Akio |last5=Itoh |first5=Kohji |title=A metabonomic approach identifies human urinary phenylacetylglutamine as a novel marker of interstitial cystitis |journal=Journal of Chromatography B |volume=877 |pages=3806–12 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2009.09.025|pmid=19815468 |issue=30}}</ref>

==Treatment==

===AUA Treatment Guidelines===
In 2011, the American Urological Association released the first consensus based guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of IC in the USA. The authors note their goal of providing insights for both healthcare providers and patients about managing this chronic condition. The Guideline outlines principles of clinical care—with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for IC patients.<ref name="auaguidelines">{{cite web|url=http://www.auanet.org/content/guidelines-and-quality-care/clinical-guidelines/main-reports/ic-bps/diagnosis_and_treatment_ic-bps.pdf |title=AUA Guidelines Diagnosis and Treatment of Interstitial Cystitis |year=2011 |work= |publisher=American Urological Association |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> 

The AUA Treatment Guidelines include a treatment protocol ranging from conservative treatments to more invasive interventions with lower numbers representing less invasive methods: 

1. First-line treatments - Patient education, self care (diet modification), stress management

2. Second-line treatments - [[Physical therapy]], oral medications (amitryptiline, [[cimetidine]] or [[hydroxyzine]], pentosan polysulfate), bladder instillations (DMSO, heparin or lidocaine)

3. Third-line treatments - Treatment of Hunner's ulcers (laser, [[fulguration]] or [[triamcinolone]] injection), hydrodistention (low pressure, short duration)

4. Fourth-line treatments - [[Neuromodulation]] ([[Sacral nerve stimulation|sacral]] or [[pudendal nerve]])

5. Fifth-line treatments - [[Cyclosporine A]], [[Botulinum Toxin]] (BTX-A)

6. Sixth-line treatments - Surgical intervention ([[urinary diversion]], augmentation, [[cystectomy]])

The AUA Guideline also listed several discontinued treatments, including: long term oral antibiotics, intravesical [[Bacillus Calmette Guerin]] (BCG), intravesical [[resiniferatoxin]] (RTX), high pressure & long duration hydrodistention, and systemic [[glucocorticoids]].

===Medication===
As recently as a decade ago, treatments available were limited to the use of [[astringent]] instillations, such as [[chlorpactin]] (oxychlorosene) or [[silver nitrate]], designed to kill "infection" and/or strip off the bladder lining. In 2005, understanding of IC/BPS improved dramatically and these therapies are now no longer used. Rather, IC/BPS therapy is typically multi-modal, including the use of a bladder coating, an [[antihistamine]] to help control [[mast cell]] activity and a low dose [[antidepressant]] to fight [[neurogenic inflammation]].<ref name="Moldwin2000">{{cite book|author=Robert M. Moldwin|title=The Interstitial Cystitis Survival Guide: Your Guide to the Latest Treatment Options and Coping Strategies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J50MAAAACAAJ|accessdate=23 November 2012|date=1 October 2000|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-210-4}}</ref> Oral pentosan polysulfate is believed to provide a protective coating in the bladder, but studies have encountered mixed results when attempting to determine if the effect is statistically significant compared to placebo.<ref name="Enigma"/><ref name="pmid18582395">{{cite journal |last1=Dimitrakov |first1=J |last2=Kroenke |first2=K |last3=Steers |first3=WD |last4=Berde |first4=C |last5=Zurakowski |first5=D |last6=Freeman |first6=MR |title=Pharmacological Management of Painful Bladder Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis: A Systematic Review |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=167 |issue=18 |pages=1922–1929 |year=2007 |pmid=17923590 |doi=10.1001/archinte.167.18.1922}}</ref><ref name="pmid16706553">{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=VR |last2=Perry |first2=CM |title=Pentosan polysulfate: a review of its use in the relief of bladder pain or discomfort in interstitial cystitis |journal=Drugs |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=821–35 |year=2006 |pmid=16706553}}</ref>

====Antidepressants====
[[Amitriptyline]] has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in many patients with IC/BPS with a median dose of 75 milligrams daily.<ref name="Enigma"/> In one study, the antidepressant [[duloxetine]] was found to be ineffective as a treatment,<ref name="Papandreou-2009">{{cite journal |last1=Papandreou |first1=Christos |last2=Skapinakis |first2=Petros |last3=Giannakis |first3=Dimitrios |last4=Sofikitis |first4=Nikolaos |last5=Mavreas |first5=Venetsanos |title=Antidepressant Drugs for Chronic Urological Pelvic Pain: an Evidence-Based Review |journal=Advances in Urology |volume=2009 |pages=1 |year=2009 |doi=10.1155/2009/797031|pmid=20169141}}</ref> although a patent exists for use of duloxetine in the context of IC, and is known to relieve neuropathic pain.

====Bladder Instillations====
[[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], a wood pulp extract, is the only approved bladder instillation for IC/BPS yet it is much less frequently used in urology clinics.<ref name="treatments">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/interstitial-cystitis/DS00497/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs |title=Treatments and drugs |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> Research studies presented at recent conferences of the [[American Urological Association]] by C. Subah Packer have demonstrated that the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved dosage of a 50% solution of DMSO had the potential to create irreversible muscle contraction. However, a lesser solution of 25% was found to be reversible. Long term use of DMSO is questionable as its mechanism of action is not fully understood though it is thought that DMSO can inhibit mast cells and may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.<ref name="Enigma"/>

More recently, the use of a "rescue instillation" composed of pentosan polysulfate or [[heparin]], [[sodium hyaluronate]], [[lidocaine]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], has generated considerable excitement in the IC/BPS community because it is the first therapeutic intervention that can be used to reduce a flare of symptoms.<ref name="treatments"/> Published studies report a 90% effectiveness in reducing symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=C |title=Successful downregulation of bladder sensory nerves with combination of heparin and alkalinized lidocaine in patients with interstitial cystitis |journal=Urology |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=45–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15667861 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2004.08.056}}</ref> Sometimes these rescue instillations are given on a regular basis for treatment.  It is important to note that this is off-label use for both pentosan polysulfate and heparin, as neither medicine has been approved to be used this way.

Other bladder coating therapies include Cystistat (sodium hyaluronate) and Uracyst ([[chondroitin]]).<ref name="Enigma"/> These treatments are believed to replace the deficient GAG layer on the bladder wall. Like most other [[intravesical]] bladder treatments, this treatment may require the patient to lie for 20&nbsp;– 40&nbsp;minutes, turning over every ten minutes, to allow the chemical to 'soak in' and give a good coating, before it is passed out with the urine. Cystistat is not currently available in the United States or Canada, though testing has recently started in Canada.  Testing has also begun for Uracyst in both Canada and the United States. Uracyst is available in Canada.

===Diet===
Interstitial cystitis patients often experience an increase in symptoms when they consume certain foods and beverages, especially caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda.<ref name="PubMed"/><ref name="Enigma"/> Dietary triggers may also include [[alcoholic beverages]], [[citrus fruits]] and juices, [[artificial sweeteners]] and [[Chili pepper|hot peppers]].<ref name="PubMed"/><ref name="diet">{{cite journal |last1=Warren|first1=JW |last2=Brown |first2=J |last3=Tracy |first3=JK |last4=Langenberg |first4=P|last5=Wesselmann|first5=U|last6=Greenberg|first6=P |title=Evidence-based criteria for the pain of interstitial cystitis/ painful bladder syndrome in women |journal=Urology |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=444–448 |year=2008 |pmid=18342184 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2007.10.062}}</ref> The challenge with diet triggers is that they vary from person to person: the best way for a person to discover his or her own triggers is to use an [[elimination diet]]. Patients may be able to reduce sensitivity to trigger foods if they consume [[Calcium glycerylphosphate|calcium glycerophosphate]] and/or sodium bicarbonate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander |first1=JI |last2=Shorter |first2=B|last3=Moldwin|first3=RM |title=Diet and its role in interstitial cystitis /bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and comorbid conditions|journal=BJU International|volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=1584–1591 |year=2012 |pmid=22233286 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.}}</ref> The foundation of therapy is a modification of diet to help patients avoid those foods which can further irritate the damaged bladder wall.

Anecdotal evidence has linked [[gluten]] intolerance to UCPPS symptoms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicprostatitis.com/wheat.html |title=Prostatitis and Wheat |publisher=www.chronicprostatitis.com |accessdate=5 November 2009 }}</ref> Studies are lacking in this area. The mechanism by which dietary modification benefits patients with IC is unclear. Researchers hypothesize that integration of neural signals from pelvic organs mediates the effects of diet on symptoms of IC.<ref name="Klumpp-2008">{{cite journal |last1=Klumpp |first1=David J |last2=Rudick |first2=Charles N |title=Summation model of pelvic pain in interstitial cystitis |journal=Nature Clinical Practice Urology |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=494–500 |year=2008 |pmid=18769376 |doi=10.1038/ncpuro1203}}</ref>

===Bladder distension===
Bladder distension (a procedure which stretches the bladder [[Volume|capacity]] while under [[general anaesthesia]]) has shown some success in reducing urinary frequency and giving pain relief to patients.<ref name="treatments"/> However, many experts still cannot understand precisely how this procedure causes pain relief.<ref name="pmid17222633">{{cite journal |last1=Erickson |first1=D |last2=Kunselman |first2=A |last3=Bentley |first3=C |last4=Peters |first4=K |last5=Rovner |first5=E |last6=Demers |first6=L |last7=Wheeler |first7=M |last8=Keay |first8=S |title=Changes in Urine Markers and Symptoms after Bladder Distention for Interstitial Cystitis |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=177 |issue=2 |pages=556–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17222633 |pmc=2373609 |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2006.09.029}}</ref> Recent studies showing that pressure on pelvic trigger points can relieve symptoms may be connected. The relief achieved by bladder distensions is only temporary (weeks or months) and consequently, is not viable as a long-term treatment for IC/BPS.

===Surgery===
[[Surgical]] interventions are rarely used for IC/BPS. Surgical intervention is very unpredictable for IC/BPS, and is considered a treatment of last resort when all other treatment modalities have failed and pain is severe.<ref name="treatments"/> Some patients who opt for surgical intervention continue to experience pain after surgery. Surgical interventions for IC/BPS include transurethral fulguration and resection of ulcers,<ref name="treatments"/> using electricity/laser; bladder denervation, where some of the nerves to the bladder are cut (Modified Ingelman-Sundberg Procedure); bladder augmentation; bladder removal (cystectomy); electrical nerve stimulation, similar to TENS, where an electrical unit is implanted in the body and provides continuous or intermittent electrical pulses to the affected areas (Interstim);<ref name="treatments"/> spinal cord stimulation (SCS),<ref name="treatments"/> where an electrical unit is implanted that provides electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, interfering with pain reception to the brain (ANS/Advanced Neuromodulation Systems spinal Cord Stimulator); and the implantation of the [[Intrathecal pump|intrathecal pain pump]], where very small amounts of medication, like [[morphine sulfate]], [[dilaudid]], or [[baclofen]] are released into the cerebrospinal fluid via a catheter stemming from the small electrical pump, requiring only about 1/100 to 1/300 the amount of medication needed orally for the same therapeutic benefit, but with significantly fewer side effects.

===Pelvic floor treatments===
Research by Wise and Anderson has shown that urologic pelvic pain syndromes, such as IC/BPS and CP/CPPS, are characterized by pelvic muscle tenderness and that symptoms may be reduced with pelvic myofascial physical therapy.<ref name="Pelvic Floor">{{cite journal |last1=
Anderson |first1=R|last2=Wise |first2=D|last3=Nathanson |first3=BH|title=Safety and effectiveness of an internal pelvic myofascial trigger point wand for urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome|journal=Clin J Pain|volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=764–8 |year=2011 |pmid=18794003}}</ref>

This is theorized to leave the pelvic area in a sensitized condition resulting in a loop of muscle tension and heightened neurological feedback ([[Pain wind-up|neural wind-up]]). This is a form of [[Myofascial pain syndrome]]. Current protocols largely focus on stretches to release overtensed muscles in the pelvic or anal area (commonly referred to as [[trigger points]]), physical therapy to the area, and progressive relaxation therapy to reduce causative stress.<ref name="Pelvic Floor">{{cite journal |last1=Bharucha |first1=AE |last2=Trabuco |first2=E |title=Functional and Chronic Anorectal and Pelvic Pain Disorders |journal=Gastroenterology Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=685-ix |year=2008 |pmid=21613956}}</ref>

Pelvic floor dysfunction is a fairly new area of specialty for physical therapists worldwide. The goal of therapy is to relax and lengthen the pelvic floor muscles, rather than to tighten and/or strengthen them as is the goal of therapy for patients with urinary incontinence. Thus, traditional exercises such as [[Kegel exercise]]s, can be helpful as they strengthen the muscles, however, they can provoke pain and additional muscle tension. A specially trained physical therapist can provide direct, hands on, evaluation of the muscles, both externally and internally.

==History==
Philadelphia surgeon Joseph Parrish published the earliest record of interstitial cystitis in 1836  describing three cases of severe lower urinary tract symptoms without the presence of a bladder stone.<ref name="pain"/> The term "interstitial cystitis" was coined by Dr. [[Alexander Skene]] in 1887 to describe the disease.<ref name="Enigma">{{cite journal |last1=Moutzouris |first1=DA |last2=Falagas |first2=ME |title=Interstitial Cystitis:An Unsolved Enigma |journal=Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |volume=4 |pages=1844–1857 |year=2009 |pmid=19808225|doi=10.2215/CJN.02000309}}</ref> In 2002, the United States amended the Social Security Act to include interstitial cystitis as a disability. The first guideline for diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis is released by a Japanese research team in 2009.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Homma|first=Y.|coauthors=Ueda T, Ito T, Takei M, Tomoe H.|title=Japanese guideline for diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis|journal=International Journal of Urology|year=2009|month=Jan|volume=16|issue=1|pages=4–16|pmid=19120522|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|doi=10.1111/j.1442-2042.2008.02208.x}}</ref> The American Urological Association released the first American [[clinical practice guideline]] for diagnosing and treating IC/BPS in 2011.

==Epidemiology==
IC/BPS affects men and women of all cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and ages. Although the disease was previously believed to be a condition of [[menopause|menopausal]] women, growing numbers of men and women are being diagnosed in their twenties and younger. IC/BPS is not a rare condition.<ref name="Moldwin2000"/> Early research suggested that IC/BPS prevalence ranged from 1 in 100,000 to 5.1 in 1,000 of the general population. In recent years, the scientific community has achieved a much deeper understanding of the epidemiology of interstitial cystitis. Recent studies<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=SH |last2=Elliott |first2=MN |last3=Suttorp |first3=M|last4=Bogart|first4=LM|last5=Stoto|first5=MA |title=Prevalence of symptoms of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis among adult females in the United States |journal=Journal of Urology |volume=186|issue=2 |pages=540–544 |year=2011 |pmid=21683389}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=MT |last2=Newman |first2=DK |last3=Page |first3=SA |title=Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome: symptom recognition is key to early identification, treatment |journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine |volume=74 Suppl 3 |pages=S54–62 |year=2007 |pmid=17546832 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.74.Suppl_3.S54}}</ref> have revealed that between 2.7 and 6.53 million women in the USA have symptoms of IC and up to 12% of women may have early symptoms of IC/BPS. Further study has estimated that the condition is far more prevalent in men than previously thought ranging from 1.8 to 4.2 million men having symptoms of interstitial cystitis.

===Characterization===
Originally called ''interstitial cystitis'', this disorder was renamed to ''interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome'' in the 2002-2010 timeframe. In 2007, the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] (NIDDK) began using the umbrella term Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS) to refer to pain syndromes associated with the bladder (i.e., interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, IC/BPS) and the [[Prostate|prostate gland]] (i.e., Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome).<ref name="NIDDK UCPPS">{{Cite web|url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DK-07-003.html|title=Multi-disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network|accessdate=11 January 2008|publisher=NIDDK|year=2007}}</ref>

In 2008, terms currently in use in addition to IC/BPS include ''painful bladder syndrome'', ''bladder pain syndrome'' and ''hypersensitive bladder syndrome'', alone and in a variety of combinations. These different terms are being used in different parts of the world. The term "interstitial cystitis" is the primary term used in [[ICD-10]] and [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]]. The condition is officially recognized as a disability in the [[United States]].<ref name="Harvard Medical School"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR2002-02-di-01.html |title=Policy Interpretation Ruling Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Interstitial Cystitis  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Social Security Administration |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>
