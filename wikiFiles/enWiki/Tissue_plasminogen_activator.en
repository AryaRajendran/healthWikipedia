'''Tissue plasminogen activator''' (abbreviated '''tPA''' or '''PLAT''') is a [[protein]] involved in the breakdown of blood [[clot]]s. It is a [[serine protease]] ({{EC number|3.4.21.68}}) found on [[endothelial cell]]s, the cells that line the [[blood vessel]]s. As an [[enzyme]], it [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the conversion of [[plasminogen]] to [[plasmin]], the major enzyme responsible for clot breakdown. Because it works on the [[clotting system]], tPA is used in [[clinical medicine]] to treat embolic or thrombotic [[stroke]].  Use is contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke and head trauma.

tPA may be manufactured using [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[Biotechnology#Pharmaceutical products|biotechnology]] techniques. tPA created this way may be referred to as '''recombinant tissue plasminogen activator''' ('''rtPA''').

==Function==
 [[Image:Fibrinolysis.png|left|thumb|250px|A simplified illustration demonstrates clot breakdown ([[fibrinolysis]]), with blue arrows denoting stimulation, and red arrows inhibition.]]

tPA and plasmin are the key enzymes of the fibrinolytic pathway in which tPA mediated plasmin generation occurs.  To be specific, tPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen at its Arg561 - Val562 peptide bond, into the serine protease plasmin.

Increased enzymatic activity causes [[hyperfibrinolysis]], which manifests as excessive bleeding. Decreased activity leads to [[hypofibrinolysis]] which can result in [[thrombosis]] or [[embolism]].

Tissue plasminogen activator also plays a role in [[cell migration]] and [[tissue remodeling]].

==Genetics==

Tissue plasminogen activator is a [[protein]] encoded by the ''PLAT'' [[gene]], which is located on [[chromosome 8]]. The [[primary transcript]] produced by this gene undergoes [[alternative splicing]], producing three distinct [[messenger RNA]]s.

==Clinical applications==
tPA is used in diseases that feature [[blood clot]]s, such as [[pulmonary embolism]], [[myocardial infarction]], and [[stroke]], in a medical treatment called [[thrombolysis]]. The most common use for ischemic stroke.  

There is significant debate regarding its effectiveness in ischemic stroke.  There have been twelve studies evaluating the use of tPA in acute ischemic stroke.  Two of these studies showed benefit to patients given tPA, four of these studies showed harm and had to be stopped before completion, the others showed neither benefit nor harm.  The largest and most recent study, called International Stroke Trial-3, showed no benefit but in post-hoc analysis found some subgroups who may benefit.  Many national guidelines including the AHA have interpreted this cohort of studies as suggesting that there are specific subgroups who may benefit from tPA and thus recommend its use.  One common complaint about these studies is that they all have authors with significant conflicts of interest such as financial ties to Genentech which manufactures tPA.  

If tPA is effective in ischemic stroke, these studies suggest that it must be administered as early as possible after the onset of symptoms. Protocol guidelines require its use intravenously within the first three hours of the event, after which its detriments may outweigh its benefits. They can either be administered systemically, in the case of acute [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke|acute ischemic stroke]], and most cases of acute massive [[pulmonary embolism]], or administered through an arterial catheter directly to the site of occlusion in the case of peripheral arterial [[thrombus|thrombi]] and thrombi in the proximal deep veins of the leg.<ref name=Rivera-Bou/> The guideline in Ontario, Canada hospitals for ischemic strokes is that tPA must be given within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Because of this, only about 3% of patients qualify for this treatment, since most patients do not seek medical assistance quickly enough.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In the United States, the window of administration used to be 3 hours from onset of symptoms, but the newer guidelines also recommend use up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset.<ref>Stroke 2009; 40: 2266-2267</ref> tPA appears to show benefit not only for large artery occlusions but also for [[lacunar stroke]]s. Since tPA dissolves [[blood clot]]s, there is risk of [[hemorrhage]] with its use.

tPA has also been given to patients with acute ischemic stroke above age 90 years old.  Although a small fraction of patients 90 years and above treated with tPA for acute ischemic stroke recover, most patients have a poor 30-day functional outcome or die.<ref name="PMID 19339651">{{cite journal | author = Mateen FJ | title = Outcomes of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke in patients aged 90 years or older | journal = Mayo Clin Proceedings. | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | year = 2009 | author-separator = , | author2 = Nasser M | display-authors = 2 | pages = 384–8 | author3 = <Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.> | pmid=19339651 | doi=10.1016/S0025-6196(11)60542-9 | pmc=2665978}}</ref> Nonagenarians may do as well as octogenarians following treatment with IV-tPA for acute ischemic stroke.<ref name="PMID 20576948">{{cite journal | author = Mateen FJ, Buchan AM, Hill MD, for the CASES investigators| title = Outcomes of thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in octogenarians versus nonagenarians | journal = Stroke. | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20576948 | pages = 1833–5 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.586438 | pmid = 20576948}}</ref> In addition, people with [[frostbite]] treated with tPA had fewer [[amputation]]s than those not treated with tPA.<ref name="pmid17576891">{{cite journal | author = Twomey JA, Peltier GL, Zera RT | title = An open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in treatment of severe frostbite | journal = J Trauma | volume = 59 | pages = 1350–1354 | discussion = 1354-1355 | year = 2005 }}; and repeated by {{cite journal |author = Bruen KJ, Ballard JR, Morris SE, Cochran A, Edelman LS, Saffle JR | title = Reduction of the incidence of amputation in frostbite injury with thrombolytic therapy | journal = Arch Surg | volume = 142 | issue = 6 | pages = 546–51; discussion 551–3 | year = 2007 | month = June | pmid = 17576891 | doi = 10.1001/archsurg.142.6.546 | url =  }}</ref> In tPA overdose, [[aminocaproic acid]] works as an antidote.<ref>[http://quizlet.com/print/334667/ Quizlet > Toxins and Antidotes]</ref>

===Recombinant tissue plasminogen activators===
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (r-tPAs) include alteplase, [[reteplase]], and [[tenecteplase]] (TNKase).<ref name=Rivera-Bou>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/811234-overview eMedicine Specialties  > Thrombolytic Therapy] Author: Wanda L Rivera-Bou; Coauthors: Jose G Cabanas and Salvador E Villanueva. Updated: Nov 20, 2008</ref>

Activase (Alteplase) is FDA-approved for treatment of [[myocardial infarction]] with ST-elevation (STEMI), [[acute ischemic stroke]] (AIS), acute massive [[pulmonary embolism]], and [[central venous access device]]s (CVAD).<ref name=Rivera-Bou/>

[[Reteplase]] is FDA-approved for [[acute myocardial infarction]], where it has more convenient administration and faster thrombolysis than alteplase.<ref name=Rivera-Bou/>

[[Tenecteplase]] is also indicated in [[acute myocardial infarction]], showing fewer bleeding complications but otherwise similar mortality rates after one year compared to alteplase.<ref name=Rivera-Bou/>

Additional r-tPAs, such as [[desmoteplase]], are under clinical development.
