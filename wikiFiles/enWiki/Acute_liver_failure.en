'''Acute liver failure''' is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs of [[liver]] disease (such as [[jaundice]]), and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 80-90% of liver cells). The complications are [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and impaired [[protein synthesis]] (as measured by the levels of [[serum albumin]] and the [[prothrombin time]] in the blood). The 1993 classification defines ''hyperacute'' as within 1 week, ''acute'' as 8–28 days and ''subacute'' as 4–12 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Grady JG, Schalm SW, Williams R |title=Acute liver failure: redefining the syndromes |journal=Lancet |volume=342 |issue=8866 |pages=273–5 |year=1993 |pmid=8101303 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91818-7|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(93)91818-7}}</ref> It reflects the fact that the pace of disease evolution strongly influences prognosis. Underlying [[etiology]] is the other significant determinant of outcome.<ref name="ogredy1">{{cite journal |author=O'Grady JG |title=Acute liver failure |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=81 |issue=953 |pages=148–54 |year=2005 |pmid=15749789 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2004.026005 |pmc=1743234}}</ref>

==Definition==

Acute liver failure is defined as "the rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction, specifically coagulopathy and mental status changes (encephalopathy) in a patient without known prior liver disease".<ref name=Sleisenger>{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=edited by Mark Feldman, Lawrence S. Friedman, Lawrence J. Brandt; consulting editor, Marvin H.|title=Sleisenger & Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, management|year=2009|publisher=MD Consult|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-1-4160-6189-2|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/das/book/pdf/307505734-5/978-1-4160-6189-2/4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-6189-2..00093-7..DOCPDF.pdf?isbn=978-1-4160-6189-2&eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-6189-2..00093-7..DOCPDF|edition=9th ed.}}</ref><sup>:1557</sup>

The diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on physical exam, laboratory findings, patient history, and past medical history to establish mental status changes, coagulopathy, rapidity of onset, and absence of known prior liver disease respectively.<ref name=Sleisenger /><sup>:1557</sup>

The exact definition of "rapid" is somewhat questionable, and different sub-divisions exist which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy. One scheme defines "acute hepatic failure" as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms. This is sub-divided into "fulminant hepatic failure", which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks, and "subfulminant", which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks.<ref name=medscape>{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Gagan K|title=Acute Liver Failure|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/177354-overview|publisher=Mescape|accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref> Another scheme defines "hyperacute" as onset within 7 days, "acute" as onset between 7 and 28 days, and "subacute" as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks.<ref name=Sleisenger /><sup>:1557</sup>

== Signs and symptoms ==
===Cerebral edema and encephalopathy===

In ALF, [[cerebral oedema]] leads to [[hepatic encephalopathy]], [[coma]], [[brain herniation]] and eventually death. Detection of encephalopathy is central to the diagnosis of ALF. It may vary from subtle deficit in [[higher brain function]] (e.g. mood, concentration in grade I) to deep coma (grade IV). Patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade IV encephalopathy. The [[pathogenesis]] remains unclear but is likely to be a consequence of several phenomena. There is a build up of toxic substances like [[ammonia]], [[mercaptan]], endogenous [[benzodiazepines]] and [[serotonin]]/[[tryptophan]] in the brain. This affects[[neurotransmitter]] level and [[neuroreceptor]] activation. Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired and is associated with [[anaerobic glycolysis]] and [[oxidative stress]]. Neuronal cell [[astrocyte]]s are susceptible to these changes and they swell up, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. Inflammatory mediators also play important role.<ref name="ogredy1"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hazell, Alan S.; Butterworth, Roger F. |title=Hepatic encephalopathy: An update of pathophysiologic mechanisms |journal=Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. |volume=222 |issue=2|pages=99–112 |year=1999 |pmid=10564534 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1373.1999.d01-120.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Larsen FS, Wendon J |title=Brain edema in liver failure: basic physiologic principles and management |journal=Liver Transpl.|volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=983–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12424710 |doi=10.1053/jlts.2002.35779}}</ref>

Unfortunately, signs of elevated [[intracranial pressure]] such as [[papilloedema]] and loss of [[pupillary]] reflexes are not reliable and occur late in the disease process. [[Computed tomography|CT]] imaging of the brain is also unhelpful in detecting early cerebral oedema but is often performed to rule out [[Intracranial hemorrhage|intra-cerebral bleeding]]. Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring via [[Dura mater|subdural]] route is often recommended, however the risk of complications must be weighed against the possible benefit (1% fatal haemorrhage).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Armstrong IR, Pollok A, Lee A |title=Complications of intracranial pressure monitoring in fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Lancet|volume=341 |issue=8846 |pages=690–1 |year=1993 |pmid=8095592 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)90458-S}}</ref> The aim is to maintain intracranial pressures below 25&nbsp;mm Hg, cerebral perfusion pressures above 50&nbsp;mm Hg.<ref name="ogredy1"/>

===Coagulopathy===

[[Coagulopathy]] is another cardinal feature of ALF. The liver has the central role in synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of [[coagulation]] and [[fibrinolysis]]. [[Hepatocellular]] [[necrosis]] leads to impaired [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] of many [[coagulation factors]] and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in [[prothrombin time]] which is widely used to monitor severity of [[hepatic]] injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects). Progressive [[thrombocytopenia]] with loss of larger and more active [[platelet]] is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without [[disseminated intravascular coagulation|DIC]] increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.<ref name="gimson"/>

{{Bleeding worksheet}}

===Renal failure===
[[Renal failure]] is common, present in more than 50% of ALF patients, either due to original insult such as paracetamol resulting in [[acute tubular necrosis]] or from [[hyperdynamic circulation]] leading to [[hepatorenal syndrome]] or [[functional renal failure]]. Because of impaired production of urea, blood urea does not represent degree of renal impairment.

===Inflammation and infection===
About 60% of all ALF patients fulfil the criteria for [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|systemic inflammatory syndrome]] irrespective of presence or absence of infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt LE, Larsen FS|title=Prognostic implications of [[lactic acid|hyperlactatemia]], multiple organ failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in patients with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=34 |issue=2|pages=337–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16424712 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000194724.70031.B6}}</ref> This often contributes towards [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multi organ failure]]. Impaired host defence mechanism, due to impaired [[opsonisation]], [[chemotaxis]] and intracellular killing, substantially increases risk of sepsis. Bacterial sepsis mostly due to [[gram positive]] organisms and fungal sepsis are observed in up to 80% and 30% patients, respectively.<ref name="gimson">{{cite journal |author=Gimson AE |title=Fulminant and late onset hepatic failure |journal=British journal of anaesthesia |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=90–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8703634 |doi=10.1093/bja/77.1.90}}</ref>

===Metabolic derangements===
[[Hyponatraemia]] is an almost universal finding due to water retention and a shift in [[intracellular]] sodium transport from inhibition of [[Na/K ATPase]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. [[Hypoglycaemia]] (due to depleted hepatic [[glycogen]] store and [[insulin|hyperinsulinaemia]]), [[hypokalaemia]], [[hypophosphataemia]] and [[Metabolic alkalosis]] are often present, independent of renal function. [[Lactic acidosis]] occurs predominantly in paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) overdose.

===Haemodynamic and cardio-respiratory compromise===

[[Hyperdynamic circulation]], with peripheral [[vasodilator|vasodilatation]] from low [[systemic vascular resistance]], leads to [[hypotension]]. There is a compensatory increase in [[cardiac output]]. [[Adrenal insufficiency]] has been documented in 60% of ALF cases, and is likely to contribute in haemodynamic compromise.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harry R, Auzinger G, Wendon J |title=The clinical importance of adrenal insufficiency in acute hepatic dysfunction|journal=Hepatology |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=395–402 |year=2002 |pmid=12143048 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2002.34514}}</ref>There is also abnormal [[oxygen]] transport and utilization. Although delivery of oxygen to the tissues is adequate, there is a decrease in tissue oxygen uptake, resulting in [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and lactic acidosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bihari D, Gimson AE, Waterson M, Williams R |title=Tissue hypoxia during fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1034–9 |year=1985 |pmid=3933911|doi=10.1097/00003246-198512000-00010}}</ref>

[[Pulmonary]] complications occur in up to 50% of patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trewby PN, Warren R, Contini S,''et al.'' |title=Incidence and pathophysiology of pulmonary edema in fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Gastroenterology|volume=74 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=859–65 |year=1978 |pmid=346431 |doi=}}</ref> Severe lung injury and [[hypoxemia]] result in high mortality. Most cases of severe lung injury are due to [[ARDS]], with or without [[sepsis]]. Pulmonary [[haemorrhage]], [[pleural effusion]]s, [[atelectasis]], and [[intrapulmonary shunt]]s also contribute to respiratory difficulty.

===Late pregnancy===

In late pregnancy liver function decreases significantly, which can be easily monitored by blood tests. Early clinical manifestations of ALF in late pregnancy include: hypodynamia, decrease in appetite, dark amber urine, deep jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li XM, Ma L, Yang YB, Shi ZJ, Zhou SS.|title=Clinical characteristics of fulminant hepatitis in pregnancy|journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=11 |issue=29|pages=4600–3 |year=2005 |pmid=16052697 |doi=}}</ref> Among patients whose deaths were attributed to ALF in late pregnancy, the majority had experienced vaginal deliveries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li XM, Ma L, Yang YB, Shi ZJ, Zhou SS.|title=Prognostic factors of fulminant hepatitis in pregnancy|journal=Chin Med J (Engl)|volume=118 |issue=20|pages=1754–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16313765 |doi=}}</ref>

==Causes==

Common causes for acute liver failure are [[Paracetamol toxicity|paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose]], idiosyncratic reaction to medication (e.g. [[tetracycline]], [[troglitazone]]), excessive [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol intake]] (severe [[alcoholic hepatitis]]), viral hepatitis (hepatitis [[hepatitis A|A]] or [[hepatitis B|B]] — it is extremely uncommon in [[hepatitis C]]), [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]], and idiopathic (without an obvious cause). [[Reye syndrome]] is acute liver failure in a child with a viral infection (e.g. [[chickenpox]]); it appears that [[aspirin]] use may play a significant role. [[Wilson's disease]] (hereditary copper accumulation) may infrequently present with acute liver failure.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Hepato-biliary.jpg|thumb|Diagram of hepatobiliary system]]
In the majority of acute liver failure (ALF) there is widespread hepatocellular necrosis beginning in the [[hepatic lobule|centrizonal distribution]] and progressing towards [[portal tract]]s. The degree of [[parenchymal]] inflammation is variable and  is proportional to duration of [[disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boyer JL, Klatskin G |title=Pattern of necrosis in acute viral hepatitis. Prognostic value of bridging (subacute hepatic necrosis) |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=283 |issue=20 |pages=1063–71 |year=1970 |pmid=4319402 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197011122832001}}</ref><ref name="gimson"/>

Zone 1 (periportal) occurs in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia.
Zone 2 (midzonal), although rare, is seen in yellow fever.
Zone 3 (centrilobular) occurs with ischemic injury, toxic effects, carbon tetrachloride exposure, or chloroform ingestion.  Drugs such as acetaminophen may be metabolized in zone 1 to toxic compounds that cause necrosis on zone 3.

== Evaluation==

All patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of moderate to severe acute hepatitis should have immediate measurement of prothrombin time and careful evaluation of mental status. If the prothrombin time is prolonged by ≈ 4–6 seconds or more (INR ≥ 1.5),
and there is any evidence of altered [[sensorium]], the diagnosis of ALF should be strongly suspected, and hospital admission is mandatory.<ref name="Polson">{{cite journal |author=Polson J, Lee WM |title=AASLD position paper: the management of acute liver failure |journal=Hepatology |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1179–97 |year=2005 |pmid=15841455 |doi=10.1002/hep.20703}}</ref> Initial laboratory examination must be extensive in order to evaluate both the aetiology and severity.

History taking should include careful review of possible exposures to viral infection and drugs or other toxins. From history and clinical examination, possibility of underlying chronic disease should be ruled out as it may require different management.

A [[liver biopsy]] done via the [[jugular|transjugular]] route because of [[coagulopathy]] is not usually necessary, other than in occasional malignancies. As the evaluation continues, several important decisions have to be made; such as whether to admit the patient to an ICU, or whether to transfer the patient to a transplant facility. Consultation with the transplant centre as early as possible is critical due to possibility of rapid progression of ALF.

Treatment involves admission to hospital. Often, [[intensive care unit]] admission or very close observation is required. Supportive treatment is with adequate [[nutrition]], optimalisation of the [[fluid balance]], [[mechanical ventilation]] and [[intracranial pressure]] monitoring (in severe encephalopathy), and treatment aimed at removing the underlying cause (such as [[acetylcysteine]] for paracetamol poisoning). Other supportive measures may include the drainage of [[ascites]].

While many people who develop acute liver failure recover with supportive treatment, [[liver transplant]]ation is often required in people who continue to deteriorate or have adverse [[Prognosis|prognostic]] factors.

"[[Liver dialysis]]" (various measures to replace normal liver function) is evolving as a treatment modality, and is gradually being introduced in the care of patients with liver failure.

===Acetylcysteine===

Intravenous [[N-acetylcysteine]] has been found to be beneficial in both [[acetaminophen toxicity]] and non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee WM, Hynan LS, Rossaro L, ''et al.'' |title=Intravenous N-acetylcysteine improves transplant-free survival in early stage non-acetaminophen acute liver failure |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=856–64, 864.e1 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19524577 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2009.06.006 |url=}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==

Historically mortality has been unacceptably high, being in excess of 80%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rakela J, Lange SM, Ludwig J, Baldus WP |title=Fulminant hepatitis: Mayo Clinic experience with 34 cases |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=289–92 |year=1985 |pmid=3921780 |doi=}}</ref> In recent years the advent of liver transplantation and multidisciplinary intensive care support have improved survival significantly. At present overall short term survival with transplant is more than 65%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ostapowicz G, Fontana RJ, Schiødt FV, ''et al.'' |title=Results of a prospective study of acute liver failure at 17 tertiary care centers in the United States |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=137 |issue=12 |pages=947–54 |year=2002 |pmid=12484709 |doi=}}</ref>

Several prognostic scoring systems have been devised to predict mortality and to identify who will require early liver transplant. These include [[King's College Hospital criteria]], [[Model for End-Stage Liver Disease|MELD score]], [[APACHE II]], and [[Clichy criteria]].

== Terminology ==

To date, no universally accepted nomenclature has been adopted. Trey and Davidson introduced the phrase ''fulminant hepatic failure'' in 1970, which they described as a "...potentially reversible condition, the consequence of severe liver injury, with an onset of [[Hepatic encephalopathy|encephalopathy]] within 8 weeks of the appearance of the first symptoms and in the absence of pre-existing liver disease".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trey C, Davidson CS |title=The management of fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Progress in liver diseases |volume=3 |issue= |pages=282–98 |year=1970 |pmid=4908702 |doi=}}</ref> Later, it was suggested that the term ''fulminant'' should be confined to patients who develop jaundice to encephalopathy within 2 weeks. Phrases ''subfulminant'' hepatic failure and ''late onset'' hepatic failure were coined for onset between 2 weeks to 3 months and for 8 weeks to 24 weeks, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernuau J, Goudeau A, Poynard T, ''et al.'' |title=Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in fulminant hepatitis B |journal=Hepatology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=648–51 |year=1986 |pmid=3732998 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840060417}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gimson AE, O'Grady J, Ede RJ, Portmann B, Williams R |title=Late onset hepatic failure: clinical, serological and histological features |journal=Hepatology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=288–94 |year=1986 |pmid=3082735 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840060222}}</ref> The umbrella phrase of ''acute liver failure'' was proposed by King's College group, which has been adopted in this article. Paradoxically, in this classification, the best prognosis is in the ''hyperacute'' group.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sass DA, Shakil AO |title=Fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Liver Transpl. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=594–605 |year=2005 |pmid=15915484 |doi=10.1002/lt.20435}}</ref>
