This technique has been used for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in [[animal model]]s, including transgastric (through the stomach) organ removal. Most recently, the transvesical and the transcolonic approaches have been advocated by some researchers as being more suited to access upper abdominal structures that are often more difficult to work with using a transgastric approach.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fong DG, Pai RD, Thompson CC |title=Transcolonic endoscopic abdominal exploration: a NOTES survival study in a porcine model |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=312–8 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17173916 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2006.08.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pai RD, Fong DG, Bundga ME, Odze RD, Rattner DW, Thompson CC |title=Transcolonic endoscopic cholecystectomy: a NOTES survival study in a porcine model (with video) |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=428–34 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16923495 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2006.06.079}}</ref> In this sequence, a group from [[Portugal]]<ref>[http://www.icvs.uminho.pt/icvs/domains/devneo/index.htm ICVS - Development & Neoplasia Research Domain<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> used transgastric and transvesical combined approach to increase the feasibility of moderately complex procedures such as [[cholecystectomy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rolanda C, Lima E, Pêgo JM, ''et al.'' |title=Third-generation cholecystectomy by natural orifices: transgastric and transvesical combined approach (with video) |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=111–7 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17185089 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2006.07.050}}</ref> NOTES was originally described in animals by researchers at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (Dr. Anthony Kalloo et al.), and was recently used for transgastric [[appendectomy]] in humans in [[India]] (by Drs.

The transvaginal access to NOTES seems to be the most safe and feasible for clinical application. In early March 2007, the NOTES Research Group in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], led by Dr. Ricardo Zorron, performed the first series of transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy in four patients, based in previous experimental studies.  With fewer potential complications, the procedure has a disadvantage of being possible only in women.

Proponents and researchers in this field recognize the potential of this technique to revolutionize the field of minimally invasive surgery by eliminating abdominal incisions.  NOTES could be the next major [[paradigm shift]] in surgery, just as [[laparoscopy]] was the major paradigm shift during the 1980s and 1990s. Potential advantages include lower anesthesia requirements; faster recovery and shorter hospital stays; avoidance of the potential complications of transabdominal wound infections (e.g. [[hernias]]); less immunosuppression; better postoperative pulmonary and diaphragmantic function; and the potential for "scarless" abdominal surgery. Critics challenge the safety and advantages of this technique in the face of effective minimally invasive surgical options such as [[laparoscopic surgery]].

Unlike laparoscopy, which was treated with much disdain as a passing fad by most nationally recognized academic institutions, NOTES is being embraced by several universities nationally.  The general impression is that NOTES, or a derivative of its technology will be accepted as the newest frontier in minimally invasive surgery.  As of today non-bariatric minimally invasive surgery fellowships offer the best opportunity to train in this new approach. However, a systematized training model to translate these procedures to the clinical practice in a safe way is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sánchez-Margallo FM, Asencio Pascual JM, Del Carmen Tejonero Alvarez M, ''et al.'' |title=Diseño del entrenamiento y la adquisición de habilidades técnicas en la colecistectomía transvaginal (NOTES) |trans_title=Training design and improvement of technical skills in the transvaginal cholecystectomy (NOTES) |language=Spanish |journal=Cirugía Española |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=307–13 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19376505 |doi=10.1016/j.ciresp.2009.02.004}}</ref>

The use of flexible endoscopes results in a partial loss of spatial orientation and depth perception. This is a potential barrier especially for surgeons who are trained to rigid laparoscopes. So research of engineers focuses on computer assisted imaging systems that provide additional 3-D information of the intervention site. Virtual off-axis view assists surgeons with a better visual depth perception during the intervention.

==NOSCAR==
Senior leadership from the [[American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy]] (ASGE) and the [[Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons]] (SAGES) organized a working group of surgeons and gastroenterologists in 2006 to develop standards for the practice of this emerging technique. This group is known as the [[Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research]] (NOSCAR). A [[White Paper]] on NOTES was released by NOSCAR simultaneously in two medical journals in May 2006. This paper identified the major areas of research needed to be addressed before NOTES can become a viable clinical application for human patient.  These areas included development of a reliable closure technique for the internal incision, prevention of infection, and creation of advanced endoscopic surgical tools.

NOTES as defined by the NOSCAR group stands for "Natural Orifice Translum'''e'''nal Endoscopic Surgery".<ref>[http://www.noscar.org/faq.php Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This describes going beyond the margins of a lum'''e'''n (=hollow organ). There is a controversy about the correct spelling of "translumenal" in NOTES whether with a terminal "e" or an "i". Even if both forms (lumenal/luminal) are used,<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/luminal</ref> the "i" is probably more correct. Analogies are found with nomen, foramen or abdomen which build the corresponding adjective form with an "i" (nominal, foraminal, abdominal).

==NESA / NOS==
Parallel to the NOTES (Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery) working group which looks beyond existing horizons and concentrates on the transgastric peritoneal access, the New European Surgical Academy (NESA) founded the NOS (Natural Orifice Surgery) working group which is exploring another surgical route, the transdouglas one.

The term difference is not accidental. ''T'' in NOTES stands for ''transluminal''. NOS includes NOTES because it refers to all surgical procedures performed through natural openings like mouth, nose, urethra and vagina.

The NESA designed a new surgical device, the [[Transdouglas Endoscopic Device]] (TED) adapted to female pelvic anatomy. The TED is a wide multi-channel flexible instrument enabling surgical procedures in the upper abdomen (cholecystectomy, [[liver biopsy]], splenectomy etc.) as well as in the pelvis (hysterectomy, cystectomy, etc.) by using a single entry. See [[Pouch of Douglas]].

The members of the European NOS working group are internationally renowned scientists, [[physiologist]]s, [[pharmacologist]]s and surgeons from various disciplines. The first meeting was on June 23, 2006 in [[Berlin]]. The planned procedures have already been simulated and preclinical studies will start soon. The NESA strongly believes that in the future, this new approach using the body natural openings and "traditional" endoscopic operations will complement each other.

==NOTES outcome databases==
The last surgical innovation with such radical changes was [[laparoscopic surgery]] which was introduced in the late 1980s. Laparoscopic surgery was initially associated with an increased rate of specific complications which threatened to discredit the technique at that time. As a result, extensive research regarding safety measures was conducted in the following years. Laparoscopy is a mature technique today and is the standard procedure for many abdominal operations.Korea`s Suk Ho Lee  one of the head researchers for the NOTES research in Beth Israel Deconess, Harvard

As NOTES is associated with equally profound changes, specific complications are likely to occur. To detect possible problems early, outcome databases have been established by individual medical societies. These outcome databases are accessible in November 2010:
