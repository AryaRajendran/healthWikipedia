[[Nutrition]] and [[weight management]] before and during [[pregnancy]] has a profound effect on the development of [[infants]]. This is a rather critical time for healthy fetal development as infants rely heavily on maternal stores and nutrient for optimal growth and health outcome later in life.<ref name="Barr" /> '''Prenatal nutrition''' addresses nutrient recommendations before and during pregnancy. '''[[Birth weight]]''' of the newborn at delivery reflects the sufficiency and the quality of maternal nutrient for the fetus during pregnancy. Prenatal nutrition has a strong influence on birth weight and further development of the infant. 

A common saying that 'a woman is eating for two while pregnant' implies that a mother should consume twice as much during pregnancy. However, in reality this is not true. Although maternal consumption will directly affect both herself and the growing [[fetus]], over eating excessively will compromise the baby's health as the infant will have to work extra hard to become healthy in the future. Compared with the infant, the mother possesses the least biological risk. Therefore, excessive calories, rather than going to the infant, often get stored as fat in the mother.<ref>{{cite web|last=De Leon|first=Victoria|title=Weight Problems During Prengnacy And The Effect On Your Baby|url=http://www.toloseweightafterpregnancy.com/losing-pregnancy-weight-weight-problems-during-pregnancy-and-the-effect-on-your-baby/|work=Losing Pregnancy Weight|accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref> On the other hand, insufficient consumption will result in lower birth weight. 

Maintaining a healthy weight during [[gestation]] lowers adverse risks on infants such as [[birth defects]], as well as chronic conditions in adulthood such as [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD).<ref name="Barr" /> Ideally, the rate of weight gain should be monitored during pregnancy to support the most ideal infant development.<ref name="Draft"/>

==Background==
===Barker's Hypothesis===
<!--  Commented out: [[File:PregnancyAnatomicalModel.jpg|thumb|Anatomical pregnant model. {{pufc|PregnancyAnatomicalModel.jpg}}]] -->
The "Barker Hypothesis", or [[Thrifty phenotype]], states that conditions during pregnancy will have long term effects on adult health. Associated risk of lifelong diseases includes [[cardiovascular disease]], [[type-2 diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]].  Babies born lighter in weight appear to have an increased rate of mortality than babies born at a heavier weight.<ref name="Bateson">{{Cite journal

</ref> This does not mean that heavy babies are less of a concern. Death rate would rise as birth weight increases beyond normal birth weight range.<ref name="Barker" /> Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy gestational weight gain throughout pregnancy for achieving the optimal infant birth weight.

When this theory was first proposed, it was not well accepted and was met with much skepticism.<ref name="Byrne">{{Cite journal

</ref> Subsequent research studies supporting the theory attempted to adjust these environmental factors and in turn, provided more convincing results with minimal confounding variables.<ref name="Barker" />

"Barker's Hypothesis" is also known as “Fetal Programming Hypothesis”. The word “programming” illustrates the idea that during critical periods in early fetal development, there are persisting changes in the body structure and function that are caused by environmental stimuli.<ref name="Byrne" /> This relates to the concept of developmental plasticity where our genes can express different ranges of physiological or morphological states in response to the environmental conditions during fetal development.<ref name="Barker" /> 

If the mother has an inadequate diet then it signals the baby that the living condition in the long term will be impoverished.<ref name="Barker" /> Consequently the baby adapts by changing its body size and metabolism to prepare for harsh conditions of food shortages after birth.<ref name="Barker" /> Physiological and metabolic processes in the body undergo long term changes as a result of restricted growth.<ref name="Barker" /> When the living environment switches from the condition of malnutrition to a society of abundant supply of nutrients, this exposes the baby to a bountiful environment that goes against what its body is designed for and this places the baby at a higher risk of adult diseases later in adulthood.<ref name="Barker" /> By the same token, if the fetus growing in the womb of a healthy mother is exposed to prolonged famine after birth, the infant would be less adaptive to the harsh environment than low birth weight babies.<ref name="Bateson" />

===The Dutch Famine===
[[File:Tile Tribute to Dutch Women.jpg|left|thumb|The tile is a tribute to the Dutch Famine.]]
Since small birth weight is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases in later life, and poor maternal nutrition during gestation contributes to restricted fetal development, maternal malnutrition may be a cause of increased disease susceptibility in adulthood. 

The '''[[Dutch famine of 1944]]''' or the 'Hunger Winter' during [[World War II]] serves as an [[epidemiological study]] that is used to examine the effects of maternal under-nutrition during different gestational stages. The famine was a period (roughly five to six months) of extreme food shortage in the west of Netherlands.<ref name="Dutch" /> The famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population and the official daily [[ration]] for the general adult population gradually decreased from 1800 calories in December 1943 to 1400 calories in October 1944 to below 1000 calories in the late November 1944.<ref name="Nestle">{{Cite book

The daily ration had increased to more than 2000 calories in June 1945.<ref name="Nestle" /> What is unique about Dutch Famine as an experimental study on the effects of maternal malnutrition is that the population was strictly circumscribed in time and place and the sudden onset and relief of the famine was imposed on a previously well-nourished population.<ref name="Dutch">{{Cite journal

The Dutch Famine during World War II had a profound effect on the health condition of the general public, especially women who conceived during the period of time. The period of maternal starvation is shown to have limited intrauterine growth and has been identified as one of the most important contributor to [[coronary heart disease]] as well as other chronic diseases later in life.<ref name="Dutch" /> These findings agree well with Barker’s hypothesis; it supports the theory that maternal under-nutrition leads to a lower birth weight due to restricted intrauterine development and ultimately leads to higher risks of chronic conditions in adult life.

==Recommendations for Pregnant Women==
===Gestation Stages===
[[File:Lifesize8weekfetus.JPG|thumb|Life size model of a 8-week-old fetus (at the end of embryonic stage).]]
[[Gestation]] is the period of embryo development from [[Fertilisation|conception]] to [[birth]].<ref name="Barr" /> Gestation is about 40 weeks in humans and is divided into three [[trimesters]], each spanning 3 months.<ref name="Barr" /> Gestational stages, on the other hand, are based on physiological fetal development, which include [[blastogenesis]], embryonic stage and fetal stage.<ref name="Barr" /> 

'''Blastogenesis''' is the stage from fertilization to about 2 weeks. The fertilized egg or the zygote becomes a blastocyst where the outer layer and the inner cell mass differentiate to form placenta and the fetus respectively. [[Implantation (human embryo)|Implantation]] occurs at this stage where the blastocyst becomes buried in the [[endometrium]].<ref name="Barr">{{cite book

</ref>

'''Embryonic stage''' is approximately from 2 weeks to 8 weeks. It is also in this stage where the blastocyst develops into an [[embryo]], where all major features of human are present and operational by the end of this stage.<ref name="Barr" /> 

'''Fetal stage''' is from 9 weeks to term. During this period of time, the embryo develops rapidly and becomes a [[fetus]]. Pregnancy becomes visible at this stage.<ref name="Barr" />

===Pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gain===

[[File:Body mass index chart.svg|left|thumb|[[Body mass index|BMI]] chart.]]
The pattern and amount of weight gain is closely associated with gestational stages.<ref name="Barr" /> Additional energy is required during pregnancy due to the expansion of maternal tissues and stores in order to support fetal development. 

In the [[first trimester]] (blastogenesis and early embryonic stages), the mother experiences a minimal weight gain (approximately 0.5-2 kilograms), while the [[embryo]] weighs only 6&nbsp;grams, which is approximately the weight 6 raisins.<ref name="Barr" />

In the [[second trimester]] and [[third trimester]] (late embryonic and fetal stages), the fetus undergoes rapid weight growth and the weight increases to about 3000~4000&nbsp;grams.<ref name="Barr" /> It is also in this period that the mother experiences the bulk of her gestational weight gain but the amount of weight gain varies greatly.  The amount of weight gain depends strongly on their pre-pregnant weight.<ref name="Draft" /> 

Generally, a normal weight is strongly recommended for mothers when entering gestation, as it promotes overall health of infants.<ref name="Draft" /> Maternal body weight is determined by the [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) which is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.<ref name="BMI">{{Cite web

</ref>
While pregnant, body weight should be managed within the recommended gestational weight gain range as it is shown to have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational weight gain should also be progressive and the recommended weight depends on pre-pregnant body weight.<ref name="Barr" />

Since the total weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, it is recommended that underweight women should undergo a larger weight gain for healthy pregnancy outcomes, and overweight or obese women should undergo a smaller weight gain.<ref name="Draft" />

====Normal Weight Women====
[[File:Milch-Jogurt-Früchte.jpg|thumb|Health choices such as low-fat milk and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables should be emphasized for pregnant women.]]
Women having a BMI of 18.5~24.9 are classified as having a ''normal or healthy'' body weight. This group have the lowest risk of adverse birth outcomes.<ref name="Draft" /> Their babies are least likely to either be low-birth weight or high-birth weight. It is advised that women with a normal weight before pregnancy should gain a total of 11.5 kilograms to 16.0 kilograms throughout gestation, which is approximately 0.4 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.<ref name="Draft">{{Cite web

</ref>

In order to maintain a steady weight gain, the mother should engage in mild physical activities. Participating in [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities such as walking and swimming 3 to 4 times a week is usually adequate.<ref name="Draft" /> Vigorous physical activity is not recommended since an excessive loss of calories is induced which is not sufficient to support fetal development.

A proper diet is also essential to healthy weight gain. The common saying “a women is eating for two” often leads to mothers thinking that they should eat twice as much. In reality, only a small increase in caloric intake is needed to provide for the fetus; approximately 350 calories more in the second trimester and 450 calories more in the third trimester.<ref name="Draft" /> Also, healthy choices should be emphasized for these extra calories such as [[whole grain]] products, [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] as well as low-fat dairy alternatives.<ref name="Draft" />

====Underweight Women====
Women are classified as ''underweight'' if they have a pre-pregnant BMI of 18.5 or below.<ref name="Draft" /> Low pre-pregnancy BMI increases the risk of low birth weight infants, but the risk can be balanced by an appropriate gestational weight gain from 12.5 to 18.0 kilograms in total, or about 0.5 kilogram each week in the second and third trimesters.<ref name="Draft" />  

Underweight women usually have inadequate nutrient stores that are not enough to provide for both herself and the fetus.<ref name="Draft" /> While exercise and a proper diet are both needed to maintain the recommended weight gain, a balance between the two is very important. As such, underweight mothers should seek individualized advice tailored especially for themselves.<ref name="Draft" />

====Overweight and Obese Women====
Women with a high pre-pregnancy weight are classified as ''overweight or obese'', defined as having a BMI of 25 or above.<ref name="Draft" /> Women with BMI between 25 and 29.9 are in the overweight category and should gain between 7.0 and 11.5 kilograms in total, corresponding to approximately 0.28 kilogram each week during the second and third trimesters.<ref name="Draft" /> Whereas women with BMI of 30 or above are in the obese category and should gain only between 5.0 and 9.0 kilograms overall, which equates to roughly 0.2 kilogram per week in the second and third trimesters.<ref name="Draft" /> 

In general, walking is encouraged for mothers classified in this category.<ref name="Draft" /> Unfortunately, estimated energy requirements for them are not available.<ref name="Draft" /> As such, they are encouraged to record activity and intake level. This can be done with the help of tools such as My Food Guide Servings Tracker from [[Health Canada]] and EATracker that are available online.<ref name="Draft" /> In extreme cases where the BMI exceeds 35, help from a registered [[dietitian]] is recommended.<ref name="Draft" />

====Summary Table====
The following table summarizes the recommended rate of weight gain and total weight gain according to pre-pregnancy BMI for singleton pregnancies. The first column categorizes the type of body weight based on the Body Mass Index. The second column summarizes the total recommended weight gain for each type of body weight, and the third column presents the corresponding weekly weight gain during the period when the fetus undergoes rapid growth (during second and third trimesters). In extreme cases, the amount of total and weekly weight gain can vary by a factor of two depending on a woman's pre-pregnant weight. For example, a woman in the obese category is recommended to gain a total of 5~9 kilograms, whereas an underweight woman needs to gain up to 18 kilograms in weight.

</ref> Measured values from ultrasonography are compared with the growth chart to estimate fetal weight.<ref name="Lucile" /> 

Crown rump length can be used as the best ultrasonographic measurement for correct diagnosis of gestational age during the first trimester.<ref name="Lee" /> This correlation between crown rump length and gestational age would be most effectively shown when no growth defects are observed in first trimester.<ref name="Lee" />  If growth defects were observed in the first trimester, then the measurement of the date of last menstrual period becomes quite important since the crown heel length has become less of a reliable indicator of gestational age.<ref name="Lee" />

After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mother would need to visit the doctor for the measurement of [[fundal height]], which is the length from the top portion of the uterus to the pubic bone.<ref name="Lucile">[http://www.lpch.org/DiseaseHealthInfo/HealthLibrary/hrnewborn/sga.html "Small for Gestational Age"], ''Lucile Packard Children's Hospital'', 2010. Retrieved 2010-11-09.</ref>  The length measured in centimeters should correspond to the number of weeks that the mother has been pregnant.<ref name="Lucile" /> If the measured number is higher or lower than 2 centimetres, further tests using ultrasound would be needed to check the results.<ref name="Lucile" /> Another way to estimate fetal size is to look at the mother’s weight gain.<ref name="Lucile" /> How much weight the mother gains can be used to indicate fetal size.<ref name="Lucile" />

===Low Birth Weight===
[[File:Birth weight chart.png|thumb|Birth weight chart.]]
There are two ways to determine [[small for gestational age]] infants. Many research studies agree that [[SGA]] babies are those with birth weight or crown heel length measured at two [[standard deviations]] or more below the [[mean]] of the infant’s gestational age, based on data consisting of a reference population.<ref name="Lee" /> Other studies classify SGA babies as those with birth weight values below the 10th percentile of the growth chart for babies of the same gestational age.<ref name="Merialdi">{{Cite journal

</ref>  This indicates that these babies are weighing less than 90% of babies of the same gestational age. 

Many factors, including maternal, placental, and fetal factors, contribute to the cause of impaired fetal growth.<ref name="Lee" /> There are a number of maternal factors, which include age, nutritional status, alcohol abuse, smoking, and medical conditions.<ref name="Lee" />  Insufficient uteroplacental perfusion is an example of a placental factor.<ref name="Lee" /> Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic diseases are examples of fetal factors.<ref name="Lee" />
Identification of the causes of SGA for individual cases aids health professionals in finding ways to handle each unique case.<ref name="Gourley">Lisa Gourley, [http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-nutrition/4 "Prenatal Nutrition"], ''Healthline Networks, Inc.'', 2002. Retrieved 2010-11-05.</ref> Nutritional counseling, education, and consistent monitoring can be helpful to assist women bearing SGA infants.<ref name="Gourley" /> 

Complications for the infant include limitations in body growth since the number and size of cells in tissues is smaller.<ref name="Lucile" />  The infant likely did not receive enough oxygen during pregnancy so the oxygen level is low.<ref name="Lucile" />  It is also more difficult to maintain body temperature since there is less blood flow within the small body.<ref name="Lucile" />

As such, it is necessary to monitor oxygen level to make sure that it doesn’t go too low. If the baby can’t suck well, then it may be necessary for tube-feed.<ref name="Lucile" />  Since the baby cannot maintain body temperature sufficiently, a temperature-controlled bed would help to keep their bodies from losing heat.<ref name="Lucile" />  There are ways to help prevent SGA babies. Monitoring fetal growth can help identify the problem during pregnancy well before birth.<ref name="Lucile" /> It would be beneficial to seek professional help and counseling.

===High Birth Weight===
[[File:Ultrasound examination of woman.JPG|thumb|Ultrasound examination.]]
Research show that when birth weights of infants are greater than the 90th percentile of the [[growth chart]] for babies of the same gestational age, they are considered [[large for gestational age]] or LGA.<ref name="Children">Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, [http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/23374/router.asp "Large for Gestational Age"], ''Children's Hospital and Health System'', 2010. Retrieved 2010-11-09.</ref> This indicates that these babies are weighing more than 90% of babies of the same gestational age.<ref name="Children" />     

Many factors account for LGA babies, including [[genetics]] and excessive nutrient supply.<ref name="Children" />  It seems that a common factor for LGA babies is whether or not the mother has diabetes when she is pregnant.<ref name="Children" /> An indicator for excessive growth, regardless of gestational age, is the appearance of [[macrosomia]].<ref name="BabyCenter">BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board, [http://www.babycenter.com/0_labor-complication-big-baby-macrosomia_1152319.bc "Labor complication: Big baby (macrosomia)"], ''BabyCenter, L.L.C.'', 2006. Retrieved 2010-11-05.</ref> Many complications are observed for LGA babies and their mothers. A longer delivery time may be expected since it is a difficult birth.<ref name="Children" /> The infant would likely suffer hypoglycemia (low glucose level in the blood) after birth.<ref name="Children" /> The infant would also have difficulty breathing.<ref name="Children" /> 

There might be a need for early delivery if the baby gets too big and perhaps [[Caesarean section]] would be needed.<ref name="Children" /> Since the baby is bigger in size, there’s a higher chance of injury when coming out of the mother’s body.<ref name="Children" /> To increase the blood glucose level in blood, a glucose/water solution can be offered to the infant.<ref name="Children" /> 

There are ways to help prevent LGA babies. It is necessary to monitor fetal growth and perform pregnancy examinations to determine health status and detect any possibility of unrecognized diabetes.<ref name="Children" /> For diabetic mothers, careful management of diabetes during pregnancy period would be helpful in terms of lowering some of the risks of LGA.<ref name="Children" />

==Points to Consider==
The goal of pregnancy is to have a healthy baby. Maintaining healthy and steady weight gain during pregnancy promotes overall health and reduces the incidence of prenatal [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the baby’s health.

Since conditions during pregnancy will have long term effects on adult health, “moderation” should be taken into account for both dietary and physical activity recommendations. Most importantly, the total recommended pregnancy weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, and weight issues should be addressed before pregnancy.

==Future Direction for Research==
It is reasonable to expect higher weight gain for multiple gestations.<ref name="Draft" /> Recommendations for women carrying twins are given but more research should be done to precisely determine the total weight gain, as these ranges are wide.<ref name="Draft" /> Also, the ranges for underweight women carrying twins is unknown. There was not enough information to recommend weight gain cutoffs and guidelines for women carrying three or more babies, women of short stature (<157 centimetres), and pregnant teens.<ref name="Draft" /> Estimated energy requirements (EER) for overweight/obese women are unavailable so more research is needed to evaluate on that.<ref name="Draft" />

==Practical Advice for Mothers==
