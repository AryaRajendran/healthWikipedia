'''Language module''' refers to a hypothesized structure in the [[human brain]] (anatomical module) or cognitive system (functional module) that some psycholinguists (e.g., [[Steven Pinker]]) claim contains [[innate]] capacities for [[language]]. According to [[Jerry Fodor]] the [[sine qua non]] of modularity is information encapsulation; that is, the module is immune from information from other sources not directly associated with language processing (Fodor, 2005){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} There is currently ongoing debate about this in the field of [[cognitive science]] ([[psycholinguistics]]) and [[neuroscience]] ([[neurolinguistics]]).

== What is a module? ==

The debate on the issue of modularity in language is underpinned, in part, by different understandings of this concept.<ref>Coltheart, M. (1999). Modularity and cognition. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 3, 115–120</ref> There is, however, some consensus in the literature that a module is considered committed to processing specialized representations ([[domain-specificity]]) (Bryson and Stein, 2001)<ref>Bryson, J. J. (2002). Language isn’t quite that special. Brain and Behavioral Sciences, 25 (6), 679–680</ref><ref name=Fodor1983>Fodor, J. A. (1983). The Modularity of Mind. Bradford Books. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA</ref> in an informationally encapsulated way.<ref>Flombaum, J. I., Santos, L. R., & Hauser, M. D. (2002). Neuroecology and psychological modularity. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 6 (3), 106–108</ref><ref name=Fodor1983/> A distinction should be drawn between  anatomical modularity, which proposes there is one 'area' in the brain that deals with this processing, and functional modularity that obviates anatomical modularity whilst maintaining information encapsulation in distributed parts of the brain.<ref>Calabretta, R., Di Ferdinando, A., Wagner, G. P., & Parisi, D. (2003). What does it take to evolve behaviorally complex organisms? BioSystems, 69, 245-262</ref>

== No singular anatomical module ==

The available evidence points towards no one anatomical area solely devoted to processing language. The [[Wada test]], where sodium amobarbital is used to anaesthetise one hemisphere, shows that the left-hemisphere appears to be crucial in language processing.<ref>Wada, J., & Rasmussen, T. (1960). Intracarotid injection of Sodium Amytal for the lateralization of cerebral speech dominance. Experimental and clinical observations. Journal of Neurosurgery, 17, 266-282</ref> Yet, neuroimaging does not implicate any single area but rather identifies many different areas as being involved in different aspects of language processing (Raichle, 1998)<ref>Martin, R. C. (2003). Language processing: Functional organization and neuroanatomical basis. Annual Review of Psychology, 54, 55-90</ref><ref>Binder, J., & Price, C. (2001). Functional imaging of language. In R. Cabeza and A. Kingstone (Eds.), Handbook of Functional Neuroimaging of Cognition (pp.&nbsp;187–251). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press</ref> and not just in the left hemisphere.<ref>Robertson, D. A., Gernsbacher, M.A., Guidotti, S.J., Robertson, R.R., Irwin, W., Mock, B.J., & Campana, E. (2000). Functional neuroanatomy of the cognitive process of mapping during discourse comprehension. Psychological Science, 11, 255–60</ref> Further, individual areas appear to subserve a number of different functions (Raichle, 1998).<ref>Grodinsky, Y. (2006). The language faculty, Broca’s region, and the mirror system. Cortex, 42 (4), 464-468</ref> Thus, the extent to which language processing occurs within an anatomical module is considered to be minimal. Nevertheless, as many have suggested,<ref>Pinker, S. (1997). How The Mind Works. Harmondsworth: Penguin</ref><ref>von der Malsburg, C. (1995). Binding in models of perception and brain function. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 5, 520–52</ref> modular processing can still exist even when implemented across the brain; that is, language processing could occur within a functional module.

== No double dissociation - acquired or developmental ==

A common way to demonstrate modularity is to find a [[double dissociation]]. That is two groups: First, people for whom language is severely damaged and yet have normal cognitive abilities and, second, persons for whom normal cognitive abilities are grossly impaired and yet language remains intact.<ref>Dunn, J. C., & Kirsner, K. (2003). What can we infer from double dissociations? Cortex, 39, 1-7</ref><ref>Coltheart, M., & Davies, M. (2003). Inference and explanation in cognitive neuropsychology. Cortex, 39, 188-191</ref><ref>Moscovitch, M. & Umiltà, C. (1990). Modularity and neuropsychology: implications for the organization of attention and memory in normal and brain-damaged people. In M. F. Schwartz (Ed.), Modular Deficits in Alzheimertype dementia. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press</ref> Whilst extensive lesions in the left hemisphere perisylvian area can render persons unable to produce or perceive language (global [[aphasia]]),<ref>Goodglass, H., & Kaplan, E. (1972). The Assessment of Aphasia and Related Disorders. Philadelphia, PA: Lea & Febiger</ref> there is no known acquired case where language is completely intact in the face of severe non-linguistic deterioration.<ref>Levy, Y. (1996). Modularity of language reconsidered. Brain & Language, 55 (2), 240-263</ref> Thus, functional module status cannot be granted to language processing based on this evidence. 

However, other evidence from developmental studies has been presented (most famously by [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]]<ref>Pinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: How the mind creates language, pp.&nbsp;37–43. New York: W. Morrow</ref>) as supporting a language module, namely the purported dissociation between [[Specific Language Impairment]] (SLI), where language is disrupted whilst other mental abilities are not,<ref name="van der Lely">van der Lely, H. K. J. (2005). Domain-Specific Cognitive Systems: Insight from Grammatical Specific Language Impairment, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9 (2), 53–59</ref> and [[Williams Syndrome]] (WS) where language is said to be spared despite severe mental deficits.<ref>Bellugi, U.,Marks, S., Bihrle, A., & Sabo, H. (1988). Dissociation between language and cognitive functions in Williams syndrome. In D. Bishop and K. Mogford (Eds.), Language development in exceptional circumstances (pp.&nbsp;177–189). London: Churchill Livingstone</ref> More recent and empirically robust work has shown that these claims may be inaccurate, thus, considerably weakening support for dissociation. For example, work reviewed by Brock<ref>Brock, J. (2007). Language abilities in Williams syndrome: A critical review. Development and Psychopathology, 19, 97–127</ref> and Mervis and Beccera<ref>Mervis, C. B., & Beccera, A. M. (2007). Language and communicative development in Williams Syndrome. Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews, 13, 3-15</ref> demonstrated that language abilities in WS are no more than would be predicted by non-linguistic abilities. Further, there is considerable debate concerning whether SLI is actually a language disorder or whether its aetiology is due to a more general cognitive (e.g. phonological) problem.<ref>Norbury,C., Bishop, D. V. M., & Briscoe, J. (2001). Production of English finite verb morphology: A Comparison of SLI and mildmoderate hearing impairment. Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, 44, 165-178</ref><ref>Leonard, L. 1998, Children with Specific Language Impairment. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press</ref><ref>Bishop, D. V. M. (1994). Grammatical errors in specific language impairment: Competence or performance limitations. Applied Psycholinguistics, 15, 507–550</ref><ref>Kail, R. (1994). A method for studying the generalized slowing hypothesis in children with specific language impairment. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 37, 418–421</ref><ref name="van der Lely"/> Thus, the evidence needed to complete the picture for modularity – intact language coupled with gross intellectual deterioration – is not forthcoming. Consequently, developmental data offers little support for the notion that language processing occurs within a module. 

Thus, the evidence from double dissociations does not support modularity, although it should be noted that lack of dissociation is not evidence against a module; this inference cannot be logically made.

== Lack of information encapsulation ==

Indeed, if language were a module it would be informationally encapsulated. Yet, there is evidence to suggest that this is not the case. For instance, in the [[McGurk effect]], watching lips say one phoneme whilst another is played creates the percept of a blended phoneme.<ref>McGurk, H., & MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices. Nature, 264 (5588), 746–748</ref><ref>Carston, R. (1996). The architecture of the mind: modularity and modularization. In D. Green et al. (Eds.), Cognitive Science: An Introduction (pp.&nbsp;53–83). Cambridge: Blackwell</ref> Further, Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard and Sedivy (1995) demonstrated visual information mediating syntactic processing. In addition, the putative language module should process only that information relevant to language (i.e., be [[domain-specific]]). Yet evidence suggests that areas purported to subserve language also mediate motor control<ref>Heiser, M., Iacoboni, M., Maeda, F., Marcus, J., & Mazziotta, J.C. (2003). The essential role of Broca's area in imitation. European Journal of Neuroscience, 17, 1123-1128</ref> and non-linguistic sound comprehension.<ref>Saygin, A. P., Dick, F., Wilson, S. M., Dronkers, N. F., & Bates, E. (2003). Neural resources for processing language and environmental sounds: Evidence from aphasia. Brain, 126 (4), 928-945</ref> Although it is possible that separate processes could be occurring but below the resolution of current imaging techniques, when all this evidence is taken together the case for information encapsulation is weakened.

== The alternative ==

The alternative, as it is framed, is that language occurs within a more general cognitive system.<ref>Rumelhart, D. E., & McClelland, J. L. (1986) PDP models and general issues in cognitive science. In D. E. Rumelhart, J. L. McClelland, and the PDP Research Group (Eds.), Parallel distributed processing: Explorations in the microstructure of cognition. Volume 1: Foundations. Cambridge, MA: Bradford Books/MIT Press</ref> The counterargument is that there appears to be something ‘special’<ref>Pinker, S., & Jackendoff, R. (2005). The faculty of language: What’s special about it? Cognition, 95, 201–236</ref> about human language. This is usually supported by evidence such as all attempts to teach animals human languages to any great success have failed (Hauser et al. 2003) and that language can be selectively damaged (a single dissociation)<ref>Pulvermuller, F. (2003). The Neuroscience of Language. On Brain Circuits of Words and Serial Order. UK, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> suggesting proprietary computation may be required. Instead of postulating 'pure' modularity, theorists have opted for a weaker version, domain-specificity implemented in functionally specialised neural circuits and computation (e.g. Jackendoff and Pinker’s words, we must investigate language “not as a monolith but as a combination of components, some special to language, others rooted in more general capacities”.<ref>Jackendoff, R. & Pinker, S. (2005) The nature of the language faculty and its implications for evolution of language (Reply to Fitch, Hauser, & Chomsky) Cognition, 97 (2), 211-225, page 223</ref>  

The debate is ongoing.
