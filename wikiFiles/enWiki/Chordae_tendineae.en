The '''chordae tendineae (tendinous chords)''', or '''heart strings''', are cord-like [[tendon]]s that connect the [[papillary muscle]]s to the [[tricuspid valve]] and the [[mitral valve]] in the [[heart]].

Chordae tendineae are approximately 80% [[collagen]], while the remaining 20% is made up of [[elastin]] and endothelial cells.

==Mechanism==

During [[atrium (heart)|atrial]] [[systole (medicine)|systole]], blood flows from the atria to ventricles down the [[pressure gradient]]. Chordae tendineae are relaxed because the [[Heart valve#Atrioventricular valves|atrioventricular valve]]s are forced open.<ref name=mechanism>{{cite web |url=http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/aha/pdfhandler.00003012-197006000-00004.pdf |title=Mechanism of Function of the Mitral Valve Leaflets, Chordae Tendineae and Left Ventricular Papillary Muscles in Dogs |author=Stephen Karas, Jr., M.D. |coauthors=Ronald C.

When the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s of the heart contract in ventricular systole, the increased [[blood pressure]]s in both chambers push the AV valves to close simultaneously, preventing backflow of blood into the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]. Since the blood pressure in atria is much lower than that in the ventricles, the flaps attempt to evert to the low pressure regions. The chordae tendineae prevent the eversion, [[prolapse]], by becoming tense thus pulling the flaps, holding them in closed position.<ref name=mechanism/>

==Tendon of Todaro==
The ''tendon of Todaro'' is a continuation of the [[Valve of inferior vena cava|Eustachian Valve of the Inferior vena cava]] and the [[Thebesian valve]] of the [[coronary sinus]]. Along with the opening of the coronary sinus and the [[septal cusp]] of the tricuspid valve, it makes up the ''triangle of Koch''. The apex of the ''triangle of Koch'' is the location of the [[atrioventricular node]].
