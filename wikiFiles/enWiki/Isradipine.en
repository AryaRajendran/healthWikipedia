'''Isradipine''' (tradenames '''DynaCirc''', '''Prescal''') is a [[calcium channel blocker]] of the [[dihydropyridine]] class. It is usually prescribed for the treatment of [[high blood pressure]] in order to reduce the risk of [[stroke]] and [[heart attack]]. More recent research in animal models suggests that isradipine may have potential uses for treating [[Parkinson's disease]]  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7148/abs/nature05865.html Chan ''et al.'' 2007].

Isradipine is given as either a 2.5mg or 5mg capsule. <ref name="Isradipine" />

==Side Effects== 

'''Common side effects include:''' <ref name="Side Effects">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/isradipine-side-effects.html|title=Isradipine Side Effects}}</ref>

-Dizziness

-Warmth, redness, or tingly feeling under your skin

-Headache

-Weakness, tired feeling

-Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach

-Skin rash or itching

'''Serious side effects include: ''' <ref name="Side Effects" />

-Lightheadedness or fainting

-Shortness of breath, especially from minimal physical activity

-Swelling in the hands and feet

-Rapid and/or heavy heartbeat

-Chest pain

''If you experience one or more of these serious side effects, contact your health care provider immediately.''

==Significant Drug Interactions==

''There are other interactions beyond those listed below. Make sure to speak with a Pharmacist or Doctor if you have any concerns.'' 

'''Three major interactions are listed below.'''

1. It is advised that those using Isradipine not take Anzemet ([[Dolasetron]]), as both agents can cause a dose-dependent [[PR interval]] and [[QRS complex]] prolongation. <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/isradipine-with-onmel-1405-0-1406-15779.html|title="Isradipine and Anzemet Drug Interactions"}} </ref> 

2. Onmel/Sporanox ([[Itraconazole]]) exhibits a negative [[inotropic]] effect on the [[heart]] and thus could spur an additive effect when used concomitantly with Isradipine. Onmel/Sporanox also inhibits an important [[cytochrome]] [[liver enzyme]] ([[CYP 450]] 3A4) which is needed to [[metabolize]] Isradipine and other [[Calcium Channel Blocker]]s. This will increase [[Blood plasma|plasma]] levels of Isradipine and could cause an unintentional overdose of the medication. Caution is advised when administering both agents together. <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/isradipine-with-onmel-1405-0-1406-15779.html|title="Isradipine and Onmel Drug Interactions"}} </ref>

3. Zanaflex ([[Tizanidine]]) demonstrates [[anti-hypertensive]] effects and should be avoided in patients taking Isradipine due to the possibility of synergism between both medications. <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/isradipine-with-zanaflex-1405-0-2205-1453.html|title="Isradipine and Zanaflex Drug Interactions"}} </ref>

4. The [[anti-biotic]] Rifadin ([[Rifampin]]) lowered plasma concentrations of Isradipine to below detectable limits. <ref name="Isradipine" />

5. Tagamet ([[Cimetidine]]) increased Isradipine mean peak plasma levels. A downward dose adjustment may be necessary with this particular instance of [[polypharmacy]]. <ref name="Isradipine" /> 

6. Severe [[hypotension]] was reported with Duragesic ([[Fentanyl]]) [[anesthesia]] when it was combined with other [[Calcium Channel Blocker]]s. Even though Isradipine, another [[Calcium Channel Blocker]], has not been used in conjunction with Fentanyl anesthesia in any studies, caution is advised. <ref name="Isradipine" /> 

''Note: There was no significant interaction between Isradipine and Warfarin ([[Coumadin]]), Isradipine and Microzide [[Hydrochlorothiazide]], Isradipine and Lanoxin ([[Digoxin]]), and Isradipine and Nitrostat ([[Nitroglycerin]]).''

==Overdose==

Symptoms of an Isradipine overdose include: <ref name="Isradipine"> {{cite web|url=http://www.druglib.com/activeingredient/isradipine/|title="Isradipine: Brands, Medical Use, Clinical Data"}} </ref>

-[[Lethargy]]

-[[Sinus tachycardia]]

-Transient [[hypotension]]
