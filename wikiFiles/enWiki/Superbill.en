'''Superbill''' is itemized form utilized by [[healthcare provider]]s for reflecting rendered services. Superbill is the main data source for creation of healthcare claim, which will be submitted to payers (insurances, funds, programs) for reimbursement. Although the superbill form is not unified, and it is created/modified depending on [[healthcare provider]] specialty, type of rendered services, additional requirements, as well as ease of handling, there is a set of obligatory attributes, relevant to all superbill types.

Superbill form consists of 4 main parts, containing mandatory fields to be completed for accurate claim creation:

==Provider Information==

==Patient Information==
*Patient’s first and last name
*Patient [[Date of birth|DOB]]
*Insurance information (Insurance name/and ID)
