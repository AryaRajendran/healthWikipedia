The '''Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto''' is the [[medical school]] of the [[University of Toronto]]. The faculty is based in the [[Discovery District]] of [[Downtown Toronto]] along with most of its teaching hospitals and research institutes. Founded in 1843, it is one of Canada's oldest institutions of medical studies, and is known for the discovery of [[insulin]] and [[stem cell]]s. The [[High Impact Universities]] 2010 World University Ranking places the University of Toronto at 7th worldwide in the 'Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacology and Health Sciences' category.<ref name="hiu_heal">{{cite web |url=http://www.highimpactuniversities.com/fac1.html|title=The High Impact Universities 2010 World University Rankings For Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacology, and Health Sciences | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:C. H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|[[Frederick Banting]] joined by [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] in office, 1924 ]]
The university originally opened its medical school in 1843, providing instruction in medicine and medical sciences. In 1853, it suspended the school's teaching program and transferred teaching duties to the city's three proprietary schools: Trinity Medical College, the Toronto School of Medicine and Woman's Medical College. Because proprietary schools could not grant degrees, the university's medical school retained the responsibility of holding examinations and conferring medical degrees. As the university kept raising its standards, the medical examinations became increasingly rigorous and scientific.<ref name="historyQA_medicine"/> This led to fewer medical students from proprietary schools deciding to obtain university degrees, which were not required for medical practice at the time.<ref name="historyQA_medicine">{{cite web |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history40.htm |title=What medical school was recognized as among the "best on the continent" within 20 years of its opening? |accessdate=November 2, 2008 |work=History Q & A |publisher=University of Toronto Department of Public Affairs |year=2002}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1887, the university resumed medical teaching in its Faculty of Medicine. The faculty promptly absorbed the Toronto School of Medicine, which could no longer compete with the university as it faced heavy costs of scientific work and higher examination standards set by the faculty.<ref name="historyQA_medicine"/>

The Faculty, in partnership with [[University of Toronto Mississauga]], [[Trillium Health Centre]], and [[Credit Valley Hospital]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Mississauga Academy of Medicine|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/programs-departments/mississauga-academy-medicine|publisher=University of Toronto Mississauga|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> opened the Mississauga Academy of Medicine in August 2011 with 54 first-year students. By 2014, the Academy will have a total of 216 students enrolled in the four-year program. The new facility is located across two floors inside the new Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex and provides brand new classrooms, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories.<ref name=academy>{{cite web|title=Mississauga Academy of Medicine|url=http://www.md.utoronto.ca/partners/academies/Mississauga_Academy.htm|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> Students are provided with fully equipped student lounge and outdoor terrace to relax and socialize. Students are able to share lectures and learning experiences both inside and outside the classroom through advanced technologies.<ref name=academy />

==Curriculum==
[[File:Medicalsciencesbuilding uoft.jpg|thumb|The Medical Sciences Building is the administrative centre of the Faculty of Medicine]]
[[Image:McMurrichBuildingUniversityofTorontoCanada.JPG|thumb|The McMurrich Building contains offices of medical faculty members and researchers.]]
The [[Doctor of Medicine]] program at the University of Toronto has a total enrolment of about 850 students. In 2009, the average accepted undergraduate GPA was 3.89 (on the [[Ontario Medical Schools Application Service]] 4.0 scale) and the median score in the numerically graded sections of the [[MCAT]] was 11.<ref>Henheffer, Tom. [http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/09/17/where-did-you-go-marcus-welby/2/ "Canada’s Best Professional Schools: Where did you go, Marcus Welby?"]. ''Macleans''. September 17, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Admission Statistics |publisher=University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine |year=2009 |url=http://www.md.utoronto.ca/admissions/statistics.htm}}</ref> The University of Toronto is one of only a few programs in Canada to accept international students through its regular admission process, and not only through contract with foreign governments. The faculty also offers the M.D./PhD degree jointly with University of Toronto doctoral programs, in addition to other degrees of master of science, master of public health, master of health science, doctor of philosophy, and [[post-doctoral fellowship]]s.

The program for the Doctor of Medicine degree spans four years. The first two years are known as the preclerkship curriculum, during which M.D. candidates acquire the basic biomedical and human anatomy knowledge. The principles of medical ethics, professionalism and medical jurisprudence are also taught in preclerkship. Courses are organized into two types, consisted of block courses that are taught sequentially and continuous courses that run weekly throughout the two years. 

The final two years form the clerkship curriculum that takes place in hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The core clerkship rotations cover the essential medical specialties: surgery and internal medicine, psychiatry, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, ambulatory experience, neurology, emergency medicine, anesthesia, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and dermatology. Additional rotations are devoted to elective clerkships that provide training in subdisciplines within the major specialties.

==Hospitals and research==
The Faculty of Medicine operates a health network that comprises twelve [[teaching hospital]]s with significant emphasis on [[tertiary care]], including medical treatment, research and advisory services to patients and clients from Canada and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.research.utoronto.ca/hospitals/ |title=Hospital Partners |accessdate=March 15, 2009 |work=Experience Research |publisher=Office of the Vice-President, Research, University of Toronto |year=2008}}</ref> A core member of the network is the [[University Health Network]], which itself consists of three specialized hospitals: [[Toronto General Hospital]] for [[cardiology]] and [[organ transplant]]s; [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre]] for [[oncology]] as the home of the [[Ontario Cancer Institute]]; and [[Toronto Western Hospital]] for [[neuroscience]] and [[musculoskeletal]] health.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uhn.ca/TGH/ |title=Toronto General Hospital |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.uhn.ca/PMH/ |title=Princess Margaret Hospital |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.uhn.ca/TWH/ |title=Toronto Western Hospital |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |publisher=[[University Health Network]]}}</ref>  In total, medical students at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine have access to approximately 20 Toronto hospitals during their medical education. (See also, [[Biodiscovery Toronto]])

The [[Hospital for Sick Children]] is the [[pediatric]] medical centre specializing in treatments for childhood diseases and injuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiscoverytoronto.ca/Members/The%20Hospital%20for%20Sick%20Children.html |title=BioDiscovery Toronto – Hospital for Sick Children |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |publisher=BioDiscovery Toronto |year=2006 }}</ref> The other full affiliates of the Faculty of Medicine are [[Bloorview Kids Rehab]], [[Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care]], the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]], [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], [[St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto|St. Michael's Hospital]], [[Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre]], [[Toronto Rehabilitation Institute]] and [[Women's College Hospital]]. Physicians in the medical institutes have cross-appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in the Faculty of Medicine and other university departments. Core rotations may also involve community hospitals, which include [[North York General Hospital]], [[St. Joseph's Health Centre]], [[Toronto East General Hospital]], [[Credit Valley Hospital]] and [[Markham Stouffville Hospital]].

In 2005, the Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research opened a new research facility consisted of approximately 20,550 gross square metres [gsm] / 221,120 square feet laboratory and teaching facilities on 10 open concept floors.  Located on the U of T campus at 160 College St. W., it was designed and constructed between 2001 and 2005 by the German firm [[Behnisch Architekten]] and [[architectsAlliance]] of Toronto with their main goal focusing on collaborative ethics and sustainable design.  The site is a rectangular elongating from south to north and it is surrounded by historical buildings from its south east and west.  The site was formerly used as parking lot, service area and pathway to the medical building. The facility houses about 400 diverse research specialists, including molecular and developmental biologists, geneticists, computer scientists, chemists and bioengineers. It cost approximately $105 million, a large portion of the which were donated by philanthropist and lawyer, Terrence Donnelly. Other funding sources include the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Government of Ontario, Ontario Innovation Trust, University Infrastructure Investment Fund I’Anson Fund and private donations from University of Toronto alumni.

The Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Bimolecular Research facility received the 2006 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) International Award and the 2006 Ontario Association of Architects Award of Excellence. Despite the supposed focus on sustainability, and the claims of energy performance, the building consumes about 650 kWh/m2/yr (twice the average modern office building).<ref>http://sustain.fs.utoronto.ca/campus-footprint/</ref>

The CCBR rises above the neighboring buildings where aluminum and glass work together to create a glass tower which is standing on a concrete ground plane. The building is mainly a research facility with no lecture rooms. It is divided into two programmatic spaces. First is the public space located in the ground plane, and the second is the research facility. Three winter gardens are places in different levels across the building giving the researchers fresh air and nice space to work in. 
Unlike usual structure, each façade of the CCBR tells a different story. The south façade is a high performance curtain wall with double glazing separated by 800mm. This façade integrates a high-tech louver system, which together with the glazings,  work to maximize daylight, minimize heat gain/ loss, control glare, maximize natural ventilation and control wind. As noted above, the building uses a very high amount of energy despite any design intentions to the contrary. On the east façade colorful glazing are taking place in a sequence of the DNA bar code. Also, in the west façade when looked from distance the patterned ceramic glass represents the double stranded helix of the DNA molecule.  
Finally, with the use of social spaces, technology and sustainability the CCBR raises the standards of laboratories environment worldwide.<ref>Jen, Leslie.
