'''Web of Knowledge''' (formerly known as [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] Web of Knowledge) is an academic [[citation index]]ing and search service, which is combined with web linking and is provided by [[Thomson Reuters]]. Web of Knowledge covers the sciences, [[social science]]s, arts and [[humanities]]. It provides [[bibliography|bibliographic]] content and tools to access, analyze, and manage research information. Multiple databases can be searched simultaneously.<ref name=describe/><ref name=tutor>[http://science.thomsonreuters.com/tutorials/wok4/wok4tut3.html Tutorial]. ISI Web of Knowledge.

==Overview==
[[Image:Search result from ISI Web of Knowledge image.jpg|thumb|400px|An example search result from Web of Knowledge version 3.0]]
Web of Knowledge is described as a unifying research tool which enables the user to acquire, analyze, and disseminate database information in a timely manner. This is accomplished because of the creation of a common vocabulary for varied search terms and varied data. Moreover, search terms generate related information across categories. 

Acceptable content for Web of Knowledge is determined by an evaluation and selection process based on the following criteria: impact, influence, timeliness, [[peer review]], and geographic representation.<ref name=describe/>

===Search and analysis===
Web of Knowledge employs various search and analysis capabilities. First, citation indexing is employed, which is enhanced by the capability to search for results across disciplines. The influence, impact, history, and [[methodology]] of an idea can be followed from its first instance, notice, or referral to the present day. This technology points to a deficiency with the [[Index term|keyword]]-only method of searching. Second, subtle trends and patterns, relevant to the literature or research of interest become apparent. Broad trends indicate significant topics of the day, as well as the history relevant to both the work at hand, and particular areas of study. Third, trends can be [[mathematical modeling|graphically]] represented.<ref name=describe>[http://thomsonreuters.com/content/science/pdf/Web_of_Knowledge_factsheet.pdf Overview and Description].
