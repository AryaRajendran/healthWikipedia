'''Johann Jakob Wepfer''' (December 23, 1620 &ndash; January 26, 1695) was a Swiss [[pathologist]] and [[pharmacologist]] who was a native of [[Schaffhausen]]. 

He studied medicine in [[Strasbourg]], [[Basel]] and [[Padua]], and in 1647 returned to Schaffhausen to practice medicine. Here he maintained a practice that extended into southern Germany. During his career he also served as a private physician and consultant to various members of royalty.

Wepfer is remembered for his work involving [[Blood vessel|vascular]] [[anatomy]] of the [[brain]], and the study of [[cerebrovascular]] disease. He was the first physician to hypothesize that the effects of a [[stroke]] were caused by bleeding in the brain. He also mentioned that these symptoms could be caused by a blockage of one of the main [[artery|arteries]] that supply blood to the brain. From [[autopsy|postmortem]] studies, he provided information on the [[carotid]] and vertebral arteries that supply the brain with blood. in 1658 he published a classic treatise on strokes, titled ''Historiae apoplecticorum''.

Wepfer made important contributions in the fields of experimental [[pharmacology]] and [[toxicology]]. He conducted experiments on the toxicity of [[water hemlock]], [[hellebore]], [[monkshood]],<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=nCcoOWs4FtMC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=%22Johann+Jakob+Wepfer%22+monkshood&source=bl&ots=AmZ_gvLYEq&sig=LCFb1WW6A8f2PT--W8wq0VuP3fw&hl=en&ei=DS9VSqOUIo3CMK2tkd4C&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4 Essays in the history of therapeutics] by William F.

In the fields of pharmacology/toxicology he published an influential work on [[water hemlock|water]] and [[poison hemlock]] called ''Cicutae aquaticae historia et noxae'' (1679).<ref>[http://www.vialibri.net/item_pg/914641-1679-wepfer-johann-jacob-cicutae-aquaticae-historia-noxae.htm viaLibri] Resources for Bibliophiles</ref>

Since 2005 an annual award for stroke research, named after Wepfer, is awarded at the European stroke conference.,<ref name='ESCWepfer'>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurostroke.org/wepfer.html |title=The "Johann Jacob Wepfer Award" |accessdate=2009-07-21 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=WepferAward>{{Cite doi|10.1159/000151589}}</ref>
