'''Axon terminals''' are distal terminations of the branches of an [[axon]]. An axon nerve fiber is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] (called "action potentials") away from the neuron's [[cell body]], or soma, in order to transmit those impulses to other neurons.

Neurons are interconnected in complex arrangements, and use electrochemical signals and [[neurotransmitter]] chemicals to transmit impulses from one neuron to the next; axon terminals are separated from neighboring neurons by a small gap called a [[synapse]], across which impulses are sent. The axon terminal, and the neuron to which it is attached, is sometimes referred to as the "presynaptic" neuron.

==Nerve impulse release==
Neurotransmitters are packaged into [[synaptic vesicle]]s that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell.<ref>{{cite web |title=Axon Terminal |work=Medical Dictionary Online |url=http://www.online-medical-dictionary.org/definitions-a/axon-terminal.html |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref> The terminals release transmitter substances into a gap called the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]] between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron. The information is received by the dendrite receptors of the postsynaptic cell that are connected to it.<ref>{{cite web |author=Moosebag |publisher=Answers Corporation |title=What is an axon terminal? |date=September 29, 2012 |url=http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_an_axon_terminal |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=February 2013}}{{MEDRS|date=February 2013}}</ref> Neurons don't touch each other, but communicate across the [[synapse]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Sally |last=Foster |title=Axon Terminal - Synaptic Vesicle - Neurotransmitter |url=https://www.miracosta.edu/home/sfoster/neurons/axonterminal.htm |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=February 2013}}{{MEDRS|date=February 2013}}</ref>

The neurotransmitter molecule packages (vesicles) are created within the neuron, then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit ''[[Exocytosis#Vesicle docking|docked]]''. Calcium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180[[microsecond|µsec]] of calcium entry.<ref name="Llinás81">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84899-0 |title=Relationship between presynaptic calcium current and postsynaptic potential in squid giant synapse |year=1981 |last1=Llinás |first1=R |last2=Steinberg |first2=IZ |last3=Walton |first3=K |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=323–51 |pmid=6261850 |pmc=1327434 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=,}}</ref> Triggered by the binding of the calcium ions, the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart, resulting in the creation of a [[fusion pore]].

These membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble [[proteins]] to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as [[membrane proteins]] and [[lipids]] that are sent to become components of the cell membrane. Exocytosis in neuronal chemical [[synapses]] is Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered and serves interneuronal signalling.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

==Mapping activity==
{{Neuron map|[[Neuron]]}}

Dr. [[Wade Regehr]], professor of [[Neurobiology]] developed a method to physiologically see the synaptic activity that occurs in the brain. A dye alters the fluorenscence properties when attached to calcium. Using [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence-microscopy]] techniques calcium levels are detected, and therefore the influx of calcium in the [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic neuron]].<Ref name="Sauber">
