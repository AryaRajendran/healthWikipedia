In [[psychiatry]], '''thought disorder''' (TD) or '''formal thought disorder''' (FTD) refers to disorganized thinking as evidenced by disorganized speech.<ref name=APP>Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003</ref> Specific thought disorders include derailment, poverty of speech, tangentiality, illogicality, perseveration, neologism, and thought blocking.<ref name=APP/>

Psychiatrists consider formal thought disorder as being one of two types of disordered thinking, with the other type being [[delusions]]. The latter involves "content" while the former involves "form". Although the term "thought disorder" can refer to either type, in common parlance it refers most often to a disorder of thought "form" also known as formal thought disorder.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

[[Eugen Bleuler]], who named [[schizophrenia]], held that thought disorder was its defining characteristic.<ref name="Colman">Colman, A. M. (2001) ''Oxford Dictionary of Psychology'', Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-860761-X</ref> However, Formal thought disorder is not unique to schizophrenia or psychosis. It is often a symptom of  [[mania]], and less often it can be present in other [[mental disorder]]s such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=APP/> [[Clanging]] or [[echolalia]] may be present in [[Tourette syndrome]].<ref>Barrera A & Berrios G E (2009) Formal Thought Disorder.

==Possible signs and symptoms of thought disorder==
{{ref improve section|date=August 2012}}
In considering whether an individual has thought disorder, patterns of their speech are closely observed.  Although it is normal to exhibit some of the following during times of extreme stress (e.g. a cataclysmic event or the middle of a war) it is the degree, frequency, and the resulting functional impairment that leads to the conclusion that the person being observed has a thought disorder.

* ''[[Alogia]]'' (also ''poverty of speech'') - This refers to poverty of speech, either in amount or content; it can occur as a [[negative symptom]] of schizophrenia.<ref name=APP/>

* ''[[Thought blocking|Blocking]]''&nbsp;– Thought blocking refers to an abrupt stop in the middle of a train of thought; the individual may or may not be unable to continue the idea.<ref name=Videbeck>{{cite book |last=Videbeck |first=S |title=Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing, 4th ed. |year=2008 |publisher=Wolters Kluwers Health, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia}}</ref> This is type of formal thought disorder that can be seen in schizophrenia.<ref name=APP/>

* ''[[Circumstantiality]]''&nbsp;– Circumstantial thinking, or circumstantial speech, refers to a person being unable to answer a question without giving excessive, unnecessary detail.<ref name=Videbeck/> This differs from tangential thinking, in that the person does eventually return to the original point.

* ''[[Clanging]]'' or ''[[Clang association]]''&nbsp;– Clang associations are ideas that are related only by similar or rhyming sounds rather than actual meaning.<ref name=Videbeck/> This may be heard as excessive rhyming and/or alliteration. e.g. "Many moldy mushrooms merge out of the mildewy mud on Mondays." "I heard the bell. Well, hell, then I fell."

* ''[[Derailment (thought disorder)|Derailment]]'' (also ''Loose Association'' and ''Knight's Move thinking'')&nbsp;– Ideas slip off the topic's track on to another which is obliquely related or unrelated.<ref name=Videbeck/> e.g. "The next day when I'd be going out you know, I took control, like uh, I put bleach on my hair in California."

* ''[[Distractible speech]]''&nbsp;– During mid speech, the subject is changed in response to a stimulus. e.g. "Then I left San Francisco and moved to... where did you get that tie?"

* ''[[Echolalia]]''&nbsp;– Echoing of another's speech<ref name=Videbeck/> that may only be committed once, or may be continuous in repetition. This may involve repeating only the last few words or last word of the examiner's sentences. This can be a symptom of Tourette's Syndrome. e.g. "What would you like for dinner?", "That's a good question. ''That's a good question''. ''That's a good question''. ''That's a good question''."

* ''[[Evasive interaction]]''&nbsp;– Attempts to express ideas and/or feelings about another individual come out as evasive or in a diluted form, e.g.: "I... er ah... you are uh... I think you have... uh-- acceptable erm... uh... hair."

* ''[[Glossary of psychiatry#Flight of ideas|Flight of ideas]]''&nbsp;– Flight of ideas describes excessive speech at a rapid rate that involves fragmented or unrelated ideas.<ref name=Videbeck/> It is common in mania.<ref name=Videbeck/>

* ''[[Illogicality]]''&nbsp;– Conclusions are reached that do not follow logically (non-sequiturs or faulty inferences). e.g. "Do you think this will fit in the box?" draws a reply like "Well duh; it's brown, isn't it?"

* ''Incoherence ([[word salad (mental health)|word salad]])''&nbsp;– Speech that is unintelligible because, though the individual words are real words, the manner in which they are strung together results in incoherent gibberish,<ref name=Videbeck/> e.g. the question "Why do people comb their hair?" elicits a response like "Because it makes a twirl in life, my box is broken help me blue elephant. Isn't lettuce brave? I like electrons, hello please!"
* ''[[Loss of goal]]''&nbsp;– Failure to follow a [[train of thought]] to a natural conclusion. e.g. "Why does my computer keep crashing?", "Well, you live in a stucco house, so the pair of scissors needs to be in another drawer."

* ''[[Neologism]]s''&nbsp;– New word formations.<ref name=Videbeck/> These may also involve elisions of two words that are similar in meaning or in sound. e.g. "I got so angry I picked up a dish and threw it at the geshinker."

* ''[[Perseveration]]''&nbsp;– Persistent repetition of words or ideas even when another person attempts to change the topic.<ref name=Videbeck/> e.g. "It's great to be here in [[Nevada]], Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada."  This may also involve repeatedly giving the same answer to different questions. e.g. "Is your name Mary?"  "Yes."  "Are you in the hospital?"  "Yes."  "Are you a table?"  "Yes." Perseveration can include [[palilalia]] and [[logoclonia]], and can be an indication of organic brain disease such as [[Parkinson's]].

* ''[[Phonemic paraphasia]]''&nbsp;– Mispronunciation; syllables out of sequence. e.g. "I slipped on the lice and broke my arm."

* ''[[Pressured speech|Pressure of speech]]''&nbsp;– Unrelenting, rapid speech without pauses.<ref name=Videbeck/> It may be difficult to interrupt the speaker, and the speaker may continue speaking even when a direct question is asked.

* ''[[Self-reference]]''&nbsp;– Patient repeatedly and inappropriately refers back to self. e.g. "What's the time?", "It's 7 o'clock. That's my problem."

* ''[[Semantic paraphasia]]''&nbsp;– Substitution of inappropriate word. e.g. "I slipped on the coat, on the ice I mean, and broke my book."

* ''[[Stilted speech]]''&nbsp;– Speech characterized by the use of words or phrases that are flowery, excessive, and pompous.<ref name=Videbeck/> e.g. "The attorney comported himself indecorously."

* ''[[Tangentiality]]''&nbsp;– Wandering from the topic and never returning to it or providing the information requested.<ref name=Videbeck/> e.g. in answer to the question "Where are you from?", a response "My dog is from England. They have good fish and chips there. Fish breathe through gills."

* ''[[Word approximations]]''&nbsp;– Old words used in a new and unconventional way. e.g. "His boss was a [[wikt:overseer|seeover]]."

==Diagnosis==
The concept of thought disorder has been criticized as being based on circular or incoherent definitions.<ref name="Bentall">[[Richard Bentall|Bentall, R.]] (2003) ''Madness explained: Psychosis and Human Nature''. London: Penguin Books Ltd. ISBN 0-7139-9249-2</ref> For example, thought disorder is inferred from disordered speech, based on the assumption that disordered speech arises because of disordered thought. Incoherence, or word salad, refers to speech that is unconnected and conveys no meaning to the listener.<ref name=Videbeck>{{cite book |last=Videbeck |first=S |title=Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing, 4th ed. |year=2008 |publisher=Wolters Kluwers Health, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia}}</ref>

Furthermore, although thought disorder is typically associated with [[psychosis]], similar phenomena can appear in different disorders, potentially leading to misdiagnosis—for example, in the case of incomplete yet potentially fruitful thought processes.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

It has been suggested that individuals with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) display language disturbances like those found in [[schizophrenia]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} A 2008 study found that children and adolescents with ASD showed significantly more illogical thinking and loose associations than control subjects. The illogical thinking was related to cognitive functioning and executive control; the loose associations were related to communication symptoms and to parent reports of stress and anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Solomon M, Ozonoff S, Carter C, Caplan R |title= Formal thought disorder and the autism spectrum: relationship with symptoms, executive control, and anxiety |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1474–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18297385 |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0526-6}}</ref>
