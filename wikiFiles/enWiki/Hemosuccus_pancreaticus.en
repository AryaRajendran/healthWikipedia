'''Hemosuccus pancreaticus''', also known as '''pseudohematobilia''' or '''Wirsungorrhage''' is a rare cause of [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding|hemorrhage]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  It is caused by a bleeding source in the [[pancreas]], [[pancreatic duct]], or structures adjacent to the pancreas, such as the [[splenic artery]], that bleed into the pancreatic duct, which is connected with the bowel at the [[duodenum]], the first part of the small intestine.  Patients with hemosuccus may develop symptoms of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as blood in the stools, maroon stools, or [[melena]], which is a dark, tarry stool caused by digestion of [[red blood cells]].  They may also develop abdominal pain.  It is associated with [[pancreatitis]], [[pancreatic cancer]] and aneurysms of the splenic artery.  Hemosuccus may be identified with [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]], where fresh blood may be seen from the [[pancreatic duct]].  Alternatively, [[angiography]] may be used to inject the [[celiac axis]] to determine the blood vessel that is bleeding.  This may also be used to treat hemosuccus, as [[embolization]] of the end vessel may terminate the hemorrhage.  However, a [[distal pancreatectomy]]—surgery to removal of the tail of the pancreas—may be required to stop the hemorrhage.

==Symptoms==
Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare entity, and estimates of its rate are based on small case series.<!--

-->  The usual presentation of hemosuccus is the development of symptoms of [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding|upper]] or [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]], such as [[melena]] (or dark, black tarry stools), maroon stools, or [[hematochezia]], which is frank rectal bleeding.  The source of hemorrhage is usually not determined by standard [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] techniques, and the symptoms of the condition are usually grouped as a cause of [[gastrointestinal bleeding|obscure overt gastrointestinal hemorrhage]].  Over one-half of patients with hemosuccus also develop [[abdominal pain]], usually located in the [[epigastrium]], or uppermost part of the abdomen.  The pain is described as being "crescendo-decrescendo" in nature, meaning that it increases and decreases in intensity slowly with time.  This is thought to be due to transient blockage of the [[pancreatic duct]] from the source of bleeding, or from clots.<ref name=Clay/>  If the source of the bleeding also involves obstruction of the [[common bile duct]] (such as with some [[pancreatic cancer|tumours]] of the head of the [[pancreas]]), the patient may develop [[jaundice]], or "silver stools", an uncommon finding of acholic stools mixed with blood.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ong Y, Pintauro W | title = Silver stools | journal = JAMA | volume = 242 | issue = 22 | pages = 2433 | year = 1979 | pmid = 490859 | doi = 10.1001/jama.242.22.2433}}</ref>

==Testing and diagnosis==
[[Image:Ampulla endo.jpg|right|thumb|The '''pancreatic duct''' orifice is seen on the side of the duodenum, at the [[ampulla of Vater]], which may necessitate the use of side-viewing endoscopes to diagnose '''hemosuccus pancreaticus''']]
The diagnosis of hemosuccus pancreaticus can be difficult to make.  Most patients who develop bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract have [[endoscopy|endoscopic procedures]] done to visualize the bowel in order to find and treat the source of the bleeding.  With hemosuccus, the bleeding is coming from the [[pancreatic duct]] which enters into the first part of the [[small intestine]], termed the [[duodenum]].  Typical [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopes]] used to visualize the [[esophagus]], stomach and duodenum are designed with fiber-optic illumination that is directed in the same direction as the endoscope, meaning that visualization is in the forward direction.  However, the pancreatic duct orifice is located on the side of the duodenum, meaning that it can be missed on forward-viewing endoscopy.  A side-viewing endoscope (known as a ''duodenoscope'', or ''side-viewer'') used for [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP), a procedure to visualize the [[bile duct]]s and [[pancreatic duct]] on fluoroscopy, can be used to localize the bleeding to the pancreatic duct.<!--

-->It can be confused with [[hematobilia|bleeding from the common bile duct]] on endoscopy, leading to the term ''pseudohematobilia''.

Once the bleeding has been localized to the pancreatic duct, [[angiography]], or the injection of dye into the [[celiac artery]], which supplies the pancreas, can be performed to determine which vessel is the cause of the bleeding.  This is additionally useful to treatment, as the bleeding vessel can be occluded (termed "embolization") at the time of angiography.<ref name=Etienne>{{cite journal | author = Etienne S, Pessaux P, Tuech J, Lada P, Lermite E, Brehant O, Arnaud J | title = Hemosuccus pancreaticus: a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding | journal = Gastroenterol Clin Biol | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–42 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15864172 | doi = 10.1016/S0399-8320(05)80755-9}}</ref>

==Causes==
The causes of hemosuccus pancreaticus can be grouped into diseases of the pancreas and diseases of the vascular structures around the pancreas.  Diseases of the pancreas include [[acute pancreatitis|acute]] and [[chronic pancreatitis]],<!--

-->Pseudoaneurysms are complications of [[pancreatitis]] where a [[pseudocyst]] is formed, with one wall abutting an artery, usually the splenic artery.  Should the arterial wall rupture, the pseudoaneurysm will hemorrhage into the pancreatic duct.

Rarely the bleeding is not channeled into the bowel from the [[main pancreatic duct]] (or ''duct of Wirsung''), but rather comes from the [[accessory pancreatic duct]] (or ''duct of Santorini'').  The former is termed ''Wirsungorrhage'' and the latter is termed ''Santorinirrhage''.  Bleeding from the duct of Santorini can be caused by [[pancreas divisum]], a possible congenital cause of pancreatitis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vázquez-Iglesias J, Durana J, Yañez J, Rodriguez H, Garcia-Vallejo L, Arnal F | title = Santorinirrhage: hemosuccus pancreaticus in pancreas divisum | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 83 | issue = 8 | pages = 876–8 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3260745}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of hemosuccus pancreaticus depends on the source of the hemorrhage.  If the bleeding is identified on [[angiography]] to be coming from a vessel that is small enough to occlude, embolization through angiography may stop the bleeding.<ref name=Etienne/>  Both coils in the end-artery and [[stent]]s across the area of bleeding have been used to control the hemorrhage.<!--

-->However, the bleeding may be refractory to the embolization, which would necessitate surgery to remove the pancreas at the source of hemorrhage.  Also, the cause of bleeding may be too diffuse to be treated with embolization (such as with pancreatitis or with pancreatic cancer).  This may also require surgical therapy, and usually a distal pancreatectomy, or removal of the part of the pancreas from the area of bleeding to the [[pancreas|tail]], is required.<ref name=Clay/><ref name=Julianov/>

==History==
Hemosuccus pancreaticus was first described as a cause of hemorrhage in 1931 by Lower and Farrell, who described an aneurysm of the splenic artery causing bleeding through the pancreatic duct.<ref name=Julianov/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lower WE, Farrell JI | title = Aneurysm of the splenic artery: report of a case and review of the literature | journal = Arch. Surg. | volume = 23 | pages = 182–90 | year = 1931}}</ref>
In 1969, Vankemmel proposed the term "wirsungorrhagia" (currently used in France).<ref>Etienne S, Pessaux P, Tuech JJ, et al. Hemosuccus pancreaticus: a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastrointerol Clin Biol. 2005;29:237-42</ref> In 1970, Sandblom published 3 cases and coined the term "hemosuccus pancreaticus" to describe the similarity of the disorder to the clinical syndrome of hemobilia.<ref>Sandblom P. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage through the pancreatic duct. Ann Surg. 1970;171:61-6</ref>
