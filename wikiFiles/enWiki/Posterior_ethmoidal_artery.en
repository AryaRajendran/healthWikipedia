The '''posterior ethmoidal artery''' is an [[artery]] of the head which supplies the [[nasal septum]]. It is smaller than the [[anterior ethmoidal artery]].

==Course==
Once branching from the [[ophthalmic artery]], it passes between the upper border of the [[medial rectus muscle]] and [[superior oblique muscle]] to enter the [[posterior ethmoidal canal]].  It exits into the [[nasal cavity]] to supply [[posterior ethmoidal cells]] and [[nasal septum]]; here it [[anastomoses]] with the [[sphenopalatine artery]].

There is often a meningeal branch to the [[dura mater]] while it is still contained within the cranium.

==Supplies==
This artery supplies the posterior [[ethmoidal air sinuses]], [[dura mater]] of the [[anterior cranial fossa]], and the upper part of the [[nasal mucosa]] of the [[nasal septum]].
