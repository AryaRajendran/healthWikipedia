'''Gout''' (also known as '''podagra''' when it involves the big toe)<ref name=Egg2007/> is a [[Disease|medical condition]] usually characterized by recurrent attacks of acute [[inflammatory arthritis]]—a red, tender, hot, [[joint effusion|swollen joint]]. The [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|metatarsal-phalangeal joint]] at the base of the [[hallux|big toe]] is the most commonly affected (approximately 50% of cases). However, it may also present as [[tophi]], [[kidney stones]], or [[urate nephropathy]]. It is caused by elevated levels of [[uric acid]] in the [[blood]]. The uric acid crystallizes, and the crystals deposit in joints, [[tendon]]s, and surrounding [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s.

Clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by seeing the characteristic crystals in joint fluid. Treatment with [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), [[steroids]], or [[colchicine]] improves symptoms.  Once the acute attack subsides, levels of uric acid are usually lowered via lifestyle changes, and in those with frequent attacks, [[allopurinol]] or [[probenecid]] provide long-term prevention. 

Gout has increased in frequency in recent decades, affecting about 1–2% of the [[Western world|Western]] population at some point in their lives. The increase is believed due to increasing risk factors in the population, such as [[metabolic syndrome]], longer [[life expectancy]] and changes in diet.  Gout was historically known as "the disease of kings" or "rich man's disease".

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Gout2010.JPG|thumb|alt=side view of a foot showing a red patch of skin over the joint at the base of the big toe|Gout presenting in the [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|metatarsal-phalangeal joint]] of the big toe: Note the slight redness of the skin overlying the joint.]]
Gout can present in a number of ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute [[inflammatory arthritis]] (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint).<ref name=Review08/>  The metatarsal-phalangeal joint at the base of the [[hallux|big toe]] is affected most often, accounting for half of cases.<ref name=PM2010/>  Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected.<ref name=PM2010/>  Joint pain usually begins over 2–4&nbsp;hours and during the night.<ref name=PM2010/>  The reason for onset at night is due to the lower body temperature then.<ref name=Egg2007/>  Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and a high [[fever]].<ref name=Egg2007/><ref name=PM2010/>

Long-standing elevated [[uric acid]] levels ([[hyperuricemia]]) may result in other symptomatology, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as [[tophi]]. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic [[arthritis]] due to bone erosion.<ref name=Nature2009/>  Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the [[kidney]]s, resulting in [[kidney stone|stone]] formation and subsequent [[Acute uric acid nephropathy|urate nephropathy]].<ref name=German09/>

==Cause==
[[Hyperuricemia]] is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur for a number of reasons, including diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of [[Uric acid#Solubility of uric acid and its salts|urate]], the salts of uric acid.<ref name=Review08/>  Renal underexcretion of uric acid is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%.<ref name=Lancet2010/>  About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes.<ref name="pmid18327257">{{cite journal |author=Vitart V, Rudan I, Hayward C, ''et al.'' |title=SLC2A9 is a newly identified urate transporter influencing serum urate concentration, urate excretion and gout |journal=Nat.

When levels are between 415 and 530&nbsp;μmol/l (7 and 8.9&nbsp;mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535&nbsp;μmol/l (9&nbsp;mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.<ref name=Egg2007/>

===Lifestyle===
Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout,<ref name=Review08/> and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, [[fructose]]-sweetened drinks, meat, and seafood.<ref name=Nature2009/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=AL|title=Epidemiology of gout|journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine|date=2008 Jul|volume=75 Suppl 5|pages=S9–12|pmid=18819329}}</ref>  Other triggers include [[physical trauma]] and surgery.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Recent studies have found that other dietary factors once believed associated are, in fact, not, including the intake of [[purine]]-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) and total protein.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Choi HK, Atkinson K, Karlson EW, Willett W, Curhan G |title=Purine-rich foods, dairy and protein intake, and the risk of gout in men |journal=N.

===Genetics===
The occurrence of gout is partly genetic, contributing to about 60% of [[Genetic variability|variability]] in uric acid level.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Three [[gene]]s called ''[[SLC2A9]]'', ''[[SLC22A12]]'' and ''[[ABCG2]]'' have been found to commonly be associated with gout, and variations in them can approximately double the risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Merriman|first=TR|coauthors=Dalbeth, N|title=The genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout.|journal=Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme|date=2011 Jan|volume=78|issue=1|pages=35–40|pmid=20472486|doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2010.02.027}}</ref><ref name=Reginato2012>{{cite journal |author=Reginato AM, Mount DB, Yang I, Choi HK |title=The genetics of hyperuricaemia and gout |journal=Nat Rev Rheumatol |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22945592 |doi=10.1038/nrrheum.2012.144 |url=}}</ref> Loss of function mutations in ''SLC2A9'' and ''SLC22A12'' cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion.<ref name=Reginato2012/> A few rare genetic disorders, including [[Tamm-Horsfall protein|familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy]], [[medullary cystic kidney disease]], [[PRPSAP1|phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase]] superactivity, and [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] deficiency as seen in [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]], are complicated by gout.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

===Medical conditions===
Gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems.  [[Metabolic syndrome]], a combination of [[abdominal obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[insulin resistance]] and [[Dyslipidemia|abnormal lipid levels]], occurs in nearly 75% of cases.<ref name=PM2010/>  Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include: [[polycythemia]], [[lead poisoning]], [[renal failure]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[psoriasis]], and [[organ transplant|solid organ transplant]]s.<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref name="pmid16392875">{{cite journal |author=Stamp L, Searle M, O'Donnell J, Chapman P |title=Gout in solid organ transplantation: a challenging clinical problem |journal=Drugs |volume=65 |issue=18 |pages=2593–611 |year=2005 |pmid=16392875 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  A [[body mass index]] greater than or equal to 35 increases a male's risk of gout threefold.<ref name=Epi2008/>  Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loghman-Adham M |title=Renal effects of environmental and occupational lead exposure |journal=Environ.

===Medication===
[[Diuretic]]s have been associated with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of [[hydrochlorothiazide]] does not seem to increase the risk.<ref name=CFP09/>  Other medicines that have been associated include [[niacin]] and [[aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid).<ref name=Nature2009/> The [[immunosuppressive drug]]s [[ciclosporin]] and [[tacrolimus]] are also associated with gout,<ref name=Lancet2010/> the former particularly when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Gary S. |editor1-last=Firestein, MD |editor2-first=Ralph C. |editor2-last=Budd, MD |editor3-first=Edward D. |editor3-last=Harris Jr., MD |editor4-first= Iain B. |editor4-last=McInnes PhD, FRCP |editor5-first=Shaun |editor5-last=Ruddy, MD |editor6-first=John S. |editor6-last=Sergent, MD |title=Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology |edition=8th |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4160-4842-8 |chapter=Chapter 87: Gout and Hyperuricemia}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Harnsäure Ketoform.svg|thumb|alt=structure of organic compound: 7,9-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6,8(3H)-trione|[[Uric acid]]]]
Gout is a disorder of [[purine metabolism]],<ref name=Lancet2010/> and occurs when its final metabolite, [[uric acid]], crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate, precipitating in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues.<ref name=Nature2009/>  These crystals then trigger a local [[immune]]-mediated [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction,<ref name=Nature2009/> with one of the key proteins in the inflammatory cascade being [[interleukin 1β]].<ref name=Lancet2010/>  An evolutionary loss of [[uricase]], which breaks down uric acid, in humans and higher [[primate]]s has made this condition common.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

The triggers for precipitation of uric acid are not well understood.  While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as levels increase.<ref name=Nature2009/><ref name="pmid17595458">{{cite journal |author=Virsaladze DK, Tetradze LO, Dzhavashvili LV, Esaliia NG, Tananashvili DE |title=[Levels of uric acid in serum in patients with metabolic syndrome] |language=Russian |journal=Georgian Med News |volume= |issue=146 |pages=35–7 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17595458 |trans_title=Levels of uric acid in serum in patients with metabolic syndrome }}</ref> Other factors believed important in triggering an acute episode of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, [[acidosis]],<ref name="pmid12672211">{{cite journal| author = Moyer RA, John DS| title = Acute gout precipitated by total parenteral nutrition| journal = The Journal of rheumatology| volume = 30| issue = 4| pages = 849–50| year = 2003| month = April| pmid = 12672211| doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid7783706">{{cite journal| author = Halabe A, Sperling O| title = Uric acid nephrolithiasis| journal = Mineral and electrolyte metabolism| volume = 20| issue = 6| pages = 424–31| year = 1994| pmid = 7783706| doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> articular hydration, and [[extracellular matrix]] proteins, such as [[proteoglycans]], [[collagens]], and [[chondroitin sulfate]].<ref name=Lancet2010/> The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected.<ref name=Review08/> Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to a number of factors, including trauma, surgery, [[chemotherapy]], diuretics, and stopping or starting [[allopurinol]].<ref name=Egg2007/> [[Calcium channel blocker]]s and [[losartan]] are associated with a lower risk of gout as compared to other medications for [[hypertension]]. <ref name="pmid22240117">{{cite journal| author=Choi HK, Soriano LC, Zhang Y, Rodríguez LA| title=Antihypertensive drugs and risk of incident gout among patients with hypertension: population based case-control study. | journal=BMJ | year= 2012 | volume= 344 | issue=  | pages= d8190 | pmid=22240117 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d8190 | pmc=3257215 | url= }} </ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Gichtfuss im Roentgenbild 002.png|thumb|Gout on [[X-rays]] of a left foot. The typical location is the big toe joint. Note also the soft tissue swelling at the lateral border of the foot.]]
[[File:Fluorescent uric acid.JPG|thumb|alt=numerous multi-colored needle-shaped crystals against a purple background|Spiked rods of uric acid crystals from a [[synovial fluid]] sample photographed under a microscope with [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]]. Formation of uric acid crystals in the joints is associated with gout.]]

Gout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic podagra.  Synovial fluid analysis should be done, however, if the diagnosis is in doubt.<ref name=Egg2007/> [[X-rays]], while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in acute attacks.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

===Synovial fluid===
A definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of [[urate|monosodium urate crystals]] in [[synovial fluid]] or a [[tophus]].<ref name=PM2010>{{cite journal |author=Schlesinger N |title=Diagnosing and treating gout: a review to aid primary care physicians |journal=Postgrad Med |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=157–61 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20203467 |doi=10.3810/pgm.2010.03.2133 |url=}}</ref>  All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed inflamed joints should be examined for these crystals.<ref name=Lancet2010/>  Under [[polarized light]] microscopy, they have a needle-like morphology and strong negative [[birefringence]].  This test is difficult to perform, and often requires a trained observer.<ref name="pmid18299687">{{cite journal |author=Schlesinger N |title=Diagnosis of gout |journal=Minerva Med. |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=759–67 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18299687 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  The fluid must also be examined relatively quickly after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect their solubility.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

===Blood tests===
[[Hyperuricemia]] is a classic feature of gout, but it occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia, and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout.<ref name=PM2010/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sturrock R | title = Gout.

However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/329958-diagnosis |title=Gout: Differential Diagnoses & Workup - eMedicine Rheumatology |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/808628-diagnosis |title=Gout and Pseudogout: Differential Diagnoses & Workup - eMedicine Emergency Medicine |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×10<sup>9</sup>/l (40,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) has been documented.<ref name=Egg2007/>

===Differential diagnosis===
The most important [[differential diagnosis]] in gout is [[septic arthritis]].<ref name=PM2010/><ref name=Lancet2010/>  This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment.<ref name=PM2010/>  To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid [[Gram stain]] and culture may be performed.<ref name=PM2010/>  Other conditions that look similar include [[pseudogout]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name=PM2010/>  Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for [[basal cell carcinoma]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jordan DR, Belliveau MJ, Brownstein S, McEachren T, Kyrollos M |title=Medial canthal tophus |journal=Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=403–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18806664 |doi=10.1097/IOP.0b013e3181837a31 |url=}}</ref> or other [[neoplasm]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sano K, Kohakura Y, Kimura K, Ozeki S |title=Atypical Triggering at the Wrist due to Intratendinous Infiltration of Tophaceous Gout |journal=Hand (N Y) |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=78–80 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=18780009 |doi=10.1007/s11552-008-9120-4 |url= |pmc=2654956}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of food such as meat and seafood, consuming adequate [[vitamin C]], limiting [[alcohol]] and [[fructose]] consumption, and avoiding [[obesity]].<ref name=Review08/> A [[low-calorie diet]] in obese men decreased uric acid levels by 100&nbsp;µmol/l (1.7&nbsp;mg/dl).<ref name=CFP09/> Vitamin&nbsp;C intake of 1,500&nbsp;mg per day decreases the risk of gout by 45%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Choi HK, Gao X, Curhan G |title=Vitamin C intake and the risk of gout in men: a prospective study |journal=Arch.

A number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout, including [[xanthine oxidase inhibitor]] (including [[allopurinol]] and [[febuxostat]]) and [[uricosuric]]s (including [[probenecid]] and [[sulfinpyrazone]]). They are not usually commenced until one to two weeks after an acute attack has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack,<ref name=Review08/> and are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first three to six months.<ref name=Lancet2010/>  They are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout,<ref name=Review08/> unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or [[Acute uric acid nephropathy|urate nephropathy]] exist,<ref name=German09>{{cite journal |author=Tausche AK, Jansen TL, Schröder HE, Bornstein SR, Aringer M, Müller-Ladner U |title=Gout--current diagnosis and treatment |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=106 |issue=34–35 |pages=549–55 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19795010 |pmc=2754667 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2009.0549 }}</ref> as medications have not been found cost effective until this point.<ref name=Review08/>  Urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360&nbsp;µmol/l (5.0-6.0&nbsp;mg/dl), and are continued indefinitely.<ref name=Review08/><ref name=Lancet2010/> If these medications are being used chronically at the time of an attack, discontinueation is recommended.<ref name=PM2010/> If levels cannot be brought below 6.0&nbsp;mg/dl and there are recurrent attacks, this is deemed treatment failure or refractory gout.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S|coauthors=Lally, EV|title=Treatment failure gout.|journal=Medicine and health, Rhode Island|date=2009 Nov|volume=92|issue=11|pages=369–71|pmid=19999896}}</ref> Overall, probenecid appears less effective than allopurinol.<ref name=Review08/> 

[[Uricosuric]] medications are typically preferred if undersecretion of uric acid, as indicated by a 24-hour collection of urine results in a uric acid amount of less than 800&nbsp;mg, is found.<ref name=agabegi2nd251>{{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages=251 |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |url= http://books.google.ca/books?id=y13wgJyQwkEC&pg=PA251}}</ref> They are, however, not recommended if a person has a history of [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=agabegi2nd251/> In a 24-hour urine excretion of more than 800&nbsp;mg, which indicates overproduction, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor is preferred.<ref name=agabegi2nd251/> 

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (including allopurinol and febuxostat) block uric acid production, and long-term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals.<ref name=Review08/> In such cases, the alternative drug, febuxostat, has been recommended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA164/Guidance/Considerations_1 |title=Febuxostat for the management of hyperuricaemia in people with gout (TA164) Chapter 4.

==Prognosis==
Without treatment, an acute attack of gout usually resolves in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year.<ref name=Egg2007/> Those with gout are at increased risk of [[hypertension]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[metabolic syndrome]], and renal and [[cardiovascular disease]], thus are at increased risk of death.<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref name=Rh2008>{{cite journal |author=Kim SY, De Vera MA, Choi HK |title=Gout and mortality |journal=Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. |volume=26 |issue=5 Suppl 51 |pages=S115–9 |year=2008 |pmid=19026153 |doi= |url=}}</ref> This may be partly due to its association with [[insulin resistance]] and [[obesity]], but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.<ref name=Rh2008/>

Without treatment, episodes of acute gout may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi.<ref name=Lancet2010/> These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the [[helix (ear)|helix]] of the ear, over the [[olecranon]] processes, or on the [[Achilles tendons]].<ref name=Lancet2010/> With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. [[Kidney stones]] also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people, and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Other forms of [[Renal failure|chronic renal dysfunction]] may occur.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

==History==
[[File:Anton van Leeuwenhoek.png|thumb|alt=A man wearing a long, curly wig and a full robe is sitting, looking out. His left arm rests on a small table, with his left hand holding a box. Behind him is a globe.|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] described the microscopic appearance of uric acid crystals in 1679.<ref name="Pillinger"/>]]

The word "gout" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''gutta'', meaning "a drop" (of liquid).<ref name="Pillinger"/> According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from [[humorism]] and "the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/80290 |title=gout, n.1. |work=Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989 |accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref>

Gout has, however, been known since antiquity.  Historically, it has been referred to as "the king of diseases and the disease of kings"<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref>Kubitz possibly has gout.{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2003/04/01/cx_cd_0401feat.html |title=The Disease Of Kings - Forbes.com |work=Forbes |accessdate=}}</ref> or "rich man's disease".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rich+Man%27s+Disease |title=Rich Man's Disease - definition of Rich Man's Disease in the Medical dictionary - by the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The first documentation of the disease is from Egypt in 2,600 BC in a description of arthritis of the big toe.  The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]] around 400 BC commented on it in his ''[[Aphorisms]]'', noting its absence in [[eunuchs]] and [[premenopausal]] women.<ref name="Pillinger">{{cite journal | last=Pillinger | first=MH | coauthors=Rosenthal P, Abeles AM | title=Hyperuricemia and gout: new insights into pathogenesis and treatment | journal=Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=215–221 | year=2007 | url=http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=0c3ec9d1-8cc8-49d5-850d-4c5a55cb0669 | pmid=17922673 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/aphorisms.6.vi.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive Aphorisms by Hippocrates |work= |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref>  [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] (30 AD) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women, and associated kidney problems:
<blockquote>Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and [[sexual intercourse | venery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/4*.html |title=LacusCurtius • Celsus — On Medicine — Book IV |work= |accessdate=}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1683, [[Thomas Sydenham]], an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning, and its predilection for older males:
<blockquote>Gouty patients are, generally, either old men, or men who have so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery, and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation, and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers, and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected, and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint, and being worse as the fit comes on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A11102491 |title=BBC - h2g2 - Gout - The Affliction of Kings |work=BBC |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

The Dutch scientist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679.<ref name="Pillinger"/> In 1848, English physician [[Alfred Baring Garrod]] realized this excess uric acid in the blood was the cause of gout.<ref name="pmid11600751">{{cite journal | author=Storey GD |title=Alfred Baring Garrod (1819-1907) |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford, England) |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1189–90 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11600751 | url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/10/1189 | doi=10.1093/rheumatology/40.10.1189 }}</ref>

==In other animals==
Gout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce [[uricase]], which breaks down uric acid.<ref name=Animals01>{{cite journal |author=Agudelo CA, Wise CM |title=Gout: diagnosis, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations |journal=Curr Opin Rheumatol |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=234–9 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11333355 |doi= 10.1097/00002281-200105000-00015|url=}}</ref>  Humans and other [[great apes]] do not have this ability,  thus gout is common.<ref name=Egg2007>{{cite journal |author=Eggebeen AT |title=Gout: an update |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=801–8 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17910294 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=Animals01/>  The ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen known as "[[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]]", however, is believed to have suffered from gout.<ref name="Rothschild">{{cite journal | last=Rothschild | first=BM | coauthors=Tanke D, Carpenter K | title=Tyrannosaurs suffered from gout | journal=Nature | volume=387 | issue=6631 | page=357 | year=1997 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6631/abs/387357a0.html | doi=10.1038/387357a0 | pmid=9163417 }}</ref>
