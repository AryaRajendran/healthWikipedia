'''Vertebroplasty''' and '''kyphoplasty''' are similar [[medicine|medical]] spinal procedures in which bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin ([[percutaneous]]ly) into a fractured [[vertebra]] with the goal of relieving [[back pain]] caused by vertebral [[compression fracture]]s. It was found not to be effective in treating [[osteoporosis]]-related compression fractures of the spine in the only two [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo controlled]] and [[randomized clinical trial]]s.<ref name=Maturitas2012>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Y|coauthors=Olerud, C|title=Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty--a systematic review of cement augmentation techniques for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures compared to standard medical therapy.|journal=Maturitas|date=2012 May|volume=72|issue=1|pages=42–9|pmid=22425141}}</ref> The patients in both the experimental and placebo groups of the blinded study reported improvement in their pain, suggesting that the clinical benefit noted in [[unblinded trials]] is related to the placebo effect.  Costs of the procedure vary between $3,000 and $16,000 depending on what is done.

== Effectiveness ==
The effectiveness of vertebroplasty is in dispute.<ref name=Maturitas2012/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=J|coauthors=Rogers, W; Jeffree, RL|title=The controversy over vertebroplasty: an analysis of the debate and proposals for a way forward.|journal=Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology|date=2012 Aug|volume=56|issue=4|pages=449–51|pmid=22883654}}</ref> Two randomized and blinded trials found no benefit in those with [[osteoporosis]]-related fractures.

== Adverse effects ==
[[File:VertcementCT2.png|thumb|A CT image of cement used in kyphoplasty that has entered the spinal channel and is pressing on the spinal cord resulting in neurological symptoms]]
Some of the associated risks are from the leak of acrylic cement to outside of the vertebral body. Although severe complications are extremely rare, infection, bleeding, numbness, tingling, headache, and paralysis may ensue due to misplacement of the needle or cement. This particular risk is decreased by the use of X-ray or other radiological imaging to ensure proper placement of the cement.<ref name="epainbook" /> In those who have fractures due to cancer, the risk of serious adverse events appears to be greater at 2%.<ref name=Mon2012/>

The risk of new fractures following these procedures does not appear to be changed, however evidence is limited,<ref name="Zou E515-22"/> and an increase risk as of 2012 is not ruled out.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bliemel|first=C|coauthors=Oberkircher, L; Buecking, B; Timmesfeld, N; Ruchholtz, S; Krueger, A|title=Higher incidence of new vertebral fractures following percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty--fact or fiction?|journal=Acta orthopaedica Belgica|date=2012 Apr|volume=78|issue=2|pages=220–9|pmid=22696994}}</ref> Pulmonary cement embolism is reported to occur in approximately 2-26% of procedures.<ref name=Wang2012>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=LJ|coauthors=Yang, HL; Shi, YX; Jiang, WM; Chen, L|title=Pulmonary cement embolism associated with percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty: a systematic review.|journal=Orthopaedic surgery|date=2012 Aug|volume=4|issue=3|pages=182–9|pmid=22927153}}</ref> It may occur with or without symptoms.<ref name=Wang2012/> Typically, if there are no symptoms, there are no long term issues.<ref name=Wang2012/> Symptoms do occur in about 1 in 2000 procedures.<ref name=MSAC2011/> Other adverse effects include spinal cord injury in 0.6 per 1000.<ref name=MSAC2011>{{cite book|title=Review of interim funded service: Vertebroplasty and New review of Kyphoplasty|year=April 2011|publisher=Medical Services Advisory Committee|isbn=9781742414560|url=http://www.msac.gov.au/internet/msac/publishing.nsf/Content/0A8B7AF67EA9D41FCA25766A000DBBEA/$File/27.1%20Assessment%20report%20for%20public%20release%2019-11-11.pdf}}</ref>

== Procedure ==

Vertebroplasty is typically performed by a spine surgeon or [[interventional radiologist]]. It is a minimally invasive procedure and patients usually go home the same or next day as the procedure. Patients are given local anesthesia and light sedation for the procedure, though it can be performed using only local anesthetic for patients with medical problems who cannot tolerate sedatives well.

During the procedure, bone cement is injected with a biopsy needle into the collapsed or fractured vertebra. The needle is placed with [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic x-ray]] guidance. The cement (most commonly [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]], although more modern cements are used as well) quickly hardens and forms a support structure within the vertebra that provide stabilization and strength. The needle makes a small puncture in the patient's skin that is easily covered with a small bandage after the procedure.<ref name="epainbook">Nicole Berardoni M.D, Paul Lynch M.D, and Tory McJunkin M.D. "Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty" 2008.

=== Kyphoplasty ===
[[File:VertcementX.png|thumb|Cement in a vertebra as seen on plain Xray.]]
Kyphoplasty is a variation of a vertebroplasty which attempts to restore the height and angle of [[kyphosis]] of a fractured [[vertebra]] (of certain types), followed by its stabilization using injected bone cement. The procedure typically includes the use of a small balloon that is inflated in the vertebral body to create a void within the cancellous bone prior to cement delivery.<ref name=Ty>Ty Thaiyananthan M.D and Bryan Oh M.D. "Kyphoplasty/Vertebroplasty Procedure Illustrations" 2011. http://www.basicspine.com/conditions-procedures/spine-treatments/kyphoplasty.html</ref>  Once the void is created, the procedure continues in a similar manner as a vertebroplasty, but the bone cement is typically delivered directly into the newly created void.

In its review of vertebroplasty and vertebral augmentation procedures, Medicare contractor NAS determined that there is no difference between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, stating, "No clear evidence demonstrates that one procedure is different from another in terms of short- or long-term efficacy, complications, mortality or any other parameter useful for differentiating coverage."<ref name="Noridian"/>

==Prevalence==
In the United States in 2003 approximately 25,000 vertebroplasty procedures where paid for by medicare.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=WB|coauthors=Parker, L; Frangos, AJ; Carrino, JA|title=Vertebroplasty in the United States: guidance method and provider distribution, 2001-2003.|journal=Radiology|date=2007 Apr|volume=243|issue=1|pages=166–70|pmid=17392252}}</ref> As of 2011/2012 this number may be as high as 70,000-100,000 per year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Should You Consider Vertebroplasty?

== History ==
Vertebroplasty had been performed as an open procedure for many decades to secure pedicle screws and fill tumorous voids. However, the results were not always worth the risk involved with an [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures#Open surgery|open procedure]], which was the reason for the development of [[percutaneous]]vertebroplasty.

The first percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in 1984 at the University Hospital of Amiens, France to fill a vertebral void left after the removal of a benign [[spinal tumor]]. A report of this and 6 other patients was published in 1987 and it was introduced in the United States in the early 1990s. Initially, the treatment was used primarily for tumors in Europe and vertebral compression fractures in the United States, although the distinction has largely gone away since then.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Mathis |editor1-first=John M. |editor2-last=Deramond|editor2-first=Hervé |editor3-last=Belkoff |editor3-first=Stephen M. |title=Percutaneous Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty |edition=2nd |year=2006 |origyear=First edition published 2002 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=0-387-29078-8 |pages=3–5}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
The cost of vertebroplasty in Europe as of 2010 was ~2,500 Euro.<ref name=Mon2012/> In the United States, when done as an outpatient, vertebroplasty costs around $3300 while kyphoplasty costs around $8100 and when done as an inpatient vertebroplasty cost ~$11,000 and kyphoplasty $16,000.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mehio|first=AK|coauthors=Lerner, JH; Engelhart, LM; Kozma, CM; Slaton, TL; Edwards, NC; Lawler, GJ|title=Comparative hospital economics and patient presentation: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fracture.|journal=AJNR.

=== Medicare response ===

In response to the NEJM articles and a medical record review showing misuse of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, [[Medicare (United States)|US Medicare]] [[Medicare (United States)#Administrator|contractor]] Noridian Administrative Services (NAS) conducted a literature review and formed a policy regarding reimbursement of the procedures. NAS states that in order to be reimbursable, a procedure must meet certain criteria, including, 1) a detailed and extensively documented medical record showing pain caused by a fracture, 2) radiographic confirmation of a fracture, 3) that other treatment plans were attempted for a reasonable amount of time, 4) that the procedure is not performed in the emergency department, and 5) that at least 1 year of follow-up is planned for, among others. The policy, as referenced, applies only to the region covered by Noridian and not all of Medicare's coverage area. It became effective on 20 June 2011.<ref name="Noridian">{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/lcd-details.aspx?LCDId=24383&ContrNum=03102 |title=Local Coverage Determination (LCD) for Vertebroplasty, Vertebral Augmentation; Percutaneous (L24383) |author=Noridian Administrative Services, LLC |date= |work=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref>
