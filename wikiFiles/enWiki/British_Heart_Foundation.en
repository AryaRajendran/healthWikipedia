The '''British Heart Foundation''' (or '''BHF''') is a [[charitable organization|charity]] organisation in Britain that funds research, education, care and awareness campaigns aimed to prevent [[heart]] diseases in [[human]]s.

==Foundation==

The British Heart Foundation was founded in 1961 by a group of [[medical professional]]s who were concerned about the increasing [[death rate]] from [[cardiovascular disease]]. They wanted to fund extra research into the causes, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of heart and circulatory disease.

It is a major funder and authority in cardiovascular research, education and care, and relies predominantly on voluntary donations to meet its aims. In order to increase income and maximise the impact of its work, it also works with other organisations to combat premature death and disability from cardiovascular disease.

==Criticism==

===Animal testing===
The charity is one of 4 organisations subject to a national boycott campaign regarding their usage of animal testing. "[[Animal Aid]] plans to take out a series of newspaper adverts urging the public to stop giving money to [[Cancer Research UK]], the British Heart Foundation, the [[Alzheimer's Society]] and [[Parkinson's UK]] unless they end their support for animal testing.
