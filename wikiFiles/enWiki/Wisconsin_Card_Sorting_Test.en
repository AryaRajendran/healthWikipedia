The '''Wisconsin Card Sorting Test''' ('''WCST''') is a [[neuropsychological test]] of "[[set-shifting]]", i.e. the ability to display flexibility in the face of changing schedules of reinforcement.<ref>Monchi, O., Petrides, M. Petre, V., Worsley, K., & Dagher, A. (2001). Wisconsin card sorting revisited: Distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Journal of Neuroscience, 21(19), 7733-7741.</ref><ref name=Berg>E. A. Berg. (1948). A simple objective technique for measuring flexibility in thinking J. Gen. Psychol. 39: 15-22.</ref> The WCST was written by David A. Grant and Esta A. Berg. The Professional Manual for the WCST was written by Robert K. Heaton, Gordon J. Chelune, Jack L. Talley, Gary G. Kay, and Glenn Curtiss.

==Method==
[[File:WisconsinCardSort.png|right|thumb|Screenshot from the [[PEBL (software)|PEBL]] computerized version of the Wisconsin Card sort]]

Initially, a number of stimulus cards are presented to the participant. The participant is told to match the cards, but not how to match; however, he or she is told whether a particular match is right or wrong.<!--More detailed explanation violates the test's copyright and clinical validity-->
The original WCST used paper cards and was carried out with the experimenter on one side of the desk facing the participant on the other.<ref name=Berg/> Since the early 1990s, however, computerized versions of the task have been available, the most recent version being the [[Microsoft Windows]]-compatible version 4.0.<ref>Psychological Assessment Resources. Computerised Wisconsin Card Sort Task Version 4 (WCST). Psychological Assessment Resources; 2003.</ref> The latter has the advantage of automatically scoring the test, which was quite complex in the manual version. The test takes approximately 12â€“20 minutes to carry out and generates a number of [[psychometric]] scores, including numbers, percentages, and percentiles of: categories achieved, trials, errors, and [[Perseveration|perseverative]] errors.

==Clinical use==
Clinically, the test is widely used by [[neuropsychology|neuropsychologists]], [[clinical psychologists]], [[neurology|neurologists]] and [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] in patients with [[acquired brain injury]], [[neurodegenerative disease]], or [[mental illness]] such as [[schizophrenia]]. It has been considered a measure of executive function because of its reported sensitivity to frontal lobe dysfunction. As such, the WCST allows the clinician to assess the following "frontal" lobe functions: strategic planning, organized searching, utilizing environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behavior toward achieving a goal, and modulating impulsive responding. The test can be administered to those from 6.5 years to 89 years of age.

Although successful completion of the test relies upon a number of intact [[cognitive]] functions including [[attention]], [[working memory]], and visual processing, it is loosely termed a "[[frontal lobe]]" test on the basis that patients with any sort of frontal lobe lesion generally do poorly at the test. In particular, patients with lesions of the dorsolateral frontal lobe make a higher number of perseverative errors than control participants.<ref>Milner B. Effect of Different Brain Lesions on Card Sorting. Archives of Neurology 1963; 9: 90-100.</ref> A recent [[factor analysis]] of the WCST has shown these perseverative errors to be the most useful outcome measure in assessing cases.<ref>Greve KW, Stickle TR, Love J, Bianchini KJ, Stanford MS. Latent structure of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test: a confirmatory factor analytic study. Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology 2005; 20: 355-364.</ref> A more sophisticated description of deficits of this type is "[[executive dysfunction]]".

==Use in research==
The WCST has been used in [[neuroimaging]] paradigms such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]]. As predicted by the [[acquired brain injury]] literature, early PET studies have shown the task involves significant activation of the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].<ref>Berman KF, Ostrem JL, Randolph C et al. Physiological activation of a cortical network during performance of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test: a positron emission tomography study. Neuropsychologia 1995; 33: 1027-1046.</ref><ref>Cabeza R, Nyberg L. Imaging cognition II: An empirical review of 275 PET and fMRI studies. J Cogn Neurosci 2000; 12: 1-47.</ref> However, more recent fMRI studies have shown that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Konishi et al., 1998, Nature Neuroscience) together with the caudate nucleus (Monchi et al., 2001, J. Neuroscience) may be the regions most important for the set-shifting process required in the WCST. These regions are also associated with working memory functions (Frank et al., 2001). The test's use in [[neurodegenerative disease]]s such as [[motor neurone disease]] has identified at least a subgroup of these patients for whom there is some subtle degree of cognitive dysfunction, in contrast to the traditional view that these were pure disorders of the [[motor system]].

The test is also widely used in research into [[schizophrenia]].<ref>Cannon TD, Glahn DC, Kim J, Van Erp TG, Karlsgodt K, Cohen MS, Nuechterlein KH, Bava S, Shirinyan D., Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Activity During Maintenance and Manipulation of Information in Working Memory in Patients With Schizophrenia, Arch Gen Psychiatry 2005;62:1071-1080.</ref><ref>Rossi A, Daneluzzo E, Tomassini A, Struglia F, Cavallaro R, Smeraldi E, Stratta P., The effect of verbalization strategy on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance in schizophrenic patients receiving classical or atypical antipsychotics.
