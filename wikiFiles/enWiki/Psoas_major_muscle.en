The '''psoas major''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|.|ə|z}}) is a long [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] muscle located on the side of the lumbar region of the [[vertebral column]] and brim of the [[lesser pelvis]].  It joins the [[iliacus muscle]] to form the [[iliopsoas]].  In less than 50 percent of human subjects,<ref name="Platzer-234">Platzer (2004), p 234</ref> the psoas major is accompanied by the [[Psoas minor muscle|psoas minor]]. In mice, it is mostly a [[fast-twitching]], [[type II muscle]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2934902 |year=1985 |last1=Nunes |first1=MT |last2=Bianco |first2=AC |last3=Migala |first3=A |last4=Agostini |first4=B |last5=Hasselbach |first5=W |title=Thyroxine induced transformation in sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit soleus and psoas muscles |volume=40 |issue=9–10 |pages=726–34 |journal=Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung. Section C: Biosciences}}</ref> while in human it combines slow and fast-twitching fibers.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=636–41 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01155.x |title=Fibre type composition of the human psoas major muscle with regard to the level of its origin |year=2009 |last1=Arbanas |first1=Juraj |last2=Starcevic Klasan |first2=Gordana |last3=Nikolic |first3=Marina |last4=Jerkovic |first4=Romana |last5=Miljanovic |first5=Ivo |last6=Malnar |first6=Daniela |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=215 |issue=6 |pmid=19930517}}</ref>

==Location==
===Origin===
The psoas major is divided into a superficial and deep part. The deep part originates from the [[transverse processes]] of [[lumbar vertebrae]] I-V.  The superficial part originates from the lateral surfaces of the last [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic vertebra]], [[lumbar vertebrae]] I-IV, and from neighboring [[invertebral disc]]s. The [[lumbar plexus]] lies between the two layers.<ref name="Platzer-234" />

=== Insertion ===
Joined by the [[iliacus muscle|iliacus]], psoas major forms the [[iliopsoas muscle|iliopsoas]] which is surrounded by the [[iliac fascia]].  The iliopsoas runs across the [[iliopubic eminence]] through the [[muscular lacuna]] to its insertion on the [[lesser trochanter]] of the femur.  The [[iliopectineal bursa]] separates the tendon from the iliopsoas muscle from the external surface of the [[Capsule of hip joint|hip joint capsule]] at the level of the [[iliopubic eminence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=261-266 |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref> The iliac subtendinous bursa lies between the lesser trochanter and the attachment of the iliopsoas.<ref name="Platzer-234" />

===Innervation===
Innervation of the psoas major is through the anterior rami of L1 to L4.

==Function==
As part of the iliopsoas, psoas major contributes to [[flexion]] and [[external rotation]] in the hip joint. On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its supine position.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-422">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 422</ref>

It forms part of a group of muscles called the [[hip flexors]], whose action is primarily to lift the upper leg towards the body when the body is fixed or to pull the body towards the leg when the leg is fixed.

For example, when doing a situp that brings the torso (including the lower back) away from the ground and towards the front of the leg, the hip flexors (including the iliopsoas) will flex the spine upon the pelvis.

Due to the frontal attachment on the vertebrae, rotation of the spine will stretch the psoas.

Tightness of the psoas can result in lower back pain by compressing the lumbar discs.<ref>Akuthota, et all(2008). p 40</ref>
