The '''Proteobacteria''' are a major group ([[phylum]]) of [[bacteria]]. They include a wide variety of [[pathogen]]s, such as ''[[Escherichia]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Vibrio]]'', ''[[Helicobacter]]'', and many other notable genera.

Others are free-living, and include many of the bacteria responsible for [[nitrogen fixation]]. 

In 1987, [[Carl Woese]] established this grouping, calling it informally the "purple bacteria and their relatives".<ref name="woese87">{{cite pmid|2439888}}</ref>
Because of the great diversity of forms found in this group, the Proteobacteria are named after [[Proteus]], a Greek god of the sea, capable of assuming many different shapes, and it is therefore not named after the genus ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]''.<ref name="Stackebrandt">Stackebrandt et al.

==Characteristics==
All proteobacteria are [[Gram-negative]], with an [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] mainly composed of [[lipopolysaccharide]]s. Many move about using [[flagellum|flagella]], but some are nonmotile or rely on [[bacterial gliding]]. The last include the [[myxobacteria]], a unique group of bacteria that can aggregate to form multicellular fruiting bodies. There is also a wide variety in the types of [[metabolism]]. Most members are facultatively or obligately [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophs]], and [[heterotrophic]], but there are numerous exceptions. A variety of genera, which are not closely related to each other, convert energy from light through [[photosynthesis]]. These are called [[purple bacteria]], referring to their mostly reddish pigmentation.

The group is defined primarily in terms of [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) sequences. The Proteobacteria are divided into six sections, referred to by the [[Greek letters]] alpha through zeta, again based on rRNA sequences. These are often treated as classes. The alpha, beta, delta, epsilon sections are [[monophyletic]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Noel R. Krieg, Don J. Brenner, James T.

It should be noted that the genera ''Acidithiobacillus'' and ''Thermithiobacillus'' have been moved to a new Class within the ''Proteobacteria'' as of 2013 - the ''Acidithiobacillia''.<ref>Williams KP, Kelly DP (2013) Proposal for a new Class within the ''Proteobacteria'', the ''Acidithiobacillia'', with the ''Acidithiobacillales'' as the type Order.

The divisions of the ''Proteobacteria'' were once regarded as subclasses (e.g. α-subclass of the ''Proteobacteria''), but are now regarded as classes (e.g. the ''Alphaproteobacteria'').<ref name="Lee et al. 2005">Lee at al. Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 55 (2005), 1907–1919.</ref> The naming convention is that each Class is styled in italics with a capital first letter.<ref name="Lee et al. 2005"/>
