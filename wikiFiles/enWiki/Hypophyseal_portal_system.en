The '''hypophyseal portal system''' is the system of [[blood vessel]]s that link the [[hypothalamus]] and the [[anterior pituitary]] in the [[brain]].

It allows [[endocrine system|endocrine]] communication between the two structures : the hypothalamus secretes releasing and inhibitory [[hormones]] in the portal system such as [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] or [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]], and they are [[hormone receptor|received]] by the anterior pituitary. Using these, the anterior pituitary is able to fulfill its function of regulating the other endocrine glands.

Hypophysiotropic peptides released near the [[median eminence]] are transported to the anterior pituitary, where they exert their physiologic effects. Branches from the internal carotid artery provide the blood supply to the pituitary. The superior hypophyseal arteries form the primary capillary plexus that supplies blood to the median eminence. From this capillary network, the blood is drained in long hypophyseal portal veins into the secondary plexus. The hypophysiotropic peptides released at the median eminence enter the primary plexus capillaries. From there, they are transported to the anterior pituitary via the long hypophyseal portal veins to the secondary plexus. The secondary plexus is a network of fenestrated sinusoid capillaries that provides the blood supply to the anterior pituitary. The cells of the anterior pituitary express specific G protein-coupled receptors that bind the neuropeptides, activating intracellular second-messenger cascades that produce the release of anterior pituitary hormones. <ref>Molina, Patricia.E.

It is one of the [[portal system of circulation|portal systems of circulation]] of the human body; that is, it involves two [[capillary|capillary beds]] connected in series by [[venule]]s. One other such system is the [[hepatic portal system]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Human physiology: an integrated approach |authors=Dee Unglaub Silverthorn, William C.

==Hormone transport==
Mechanism for hormone transport via hypothalamoportal vessels:
*cells regulated by different nuclei in the hypothalamus, i.e., [[neurons]] that release [[neurotransmitters]] as hormones in the connective link between the pituitary and the brain. Hypothalamic hormones stimulate the release of the respective hormone from the anterior pituitary gland.
*[[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] (in this case, hormones released by the hypothalamus to activate hormone release from the anterior pituitary) are picked up by blood vessels, then taken to the anterior pituitary where they are broken down and released back into blood vessels
*hypothalamoportal vessels act as a local route for blood flow directly from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary.
