'''Thrombolysis''' is the breakdown (''lysis'') of [[thrombosis|blood clots]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000108543|thrombolysis}}</ref> by [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] means. It is colloquially referred to as ''clot busting'' for this reason. It works by stimulating [[fibrinolysis]] by [[plasmin]] through infusion of analogs of [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (tPA), the protein that normally activates plasmin.

==Agents==
Thrombolysis suggests the use of [[thrombolytic drug]]s, which are either derived from ''[[Streptococcus]]'' species, or, more recently, using [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[Biotechnology#Pharmaceutical_products|biotechnology]] whereby tPA is manufactured by [[bacteria]], resulting in a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or rtPA.

Some commonly used thrombolytics are:
* [[streptokinase]]
* [[urokinase]]
* [[Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator]]s
** [[alteplase]] (rtPA)
** [[reteplase]]
** [[tenecteplase]]

==Principles==
Formation of blood clots lies at the basis of a number of serious diseases (see below). By breaking down the clot, the disease process can be arrested, or the complications reduced. While other [[anticoagulant]]s (such as [[heparin]]) decrease the "growth" of a clot, thrombolytic agents actively ''reduce'' the size of the clot.

Most thrombolytic agents work by activating the enzyme [[plasminogen]], which clears the cross-linked [[fibrin]] mesh (the backbone of a clot). This makes the clot soluble and subject to further [[proteolysis]] by other enzymes, and restores blood flow over occluded [[blood vessel]]s.

==Ultrasound-Accelerated Thrombolysis==
A recent multicenter randomized trial (DUET<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schrijver |first1=AM |last2=et al |year=2011 |title=Dutch randomized trial comparing standard catheter-directed thrombolysis versus ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis for thromboembolic infrainguinal disease (DUET): design and rationale |journal=Trials |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21255459 |doi=10.1186/1745-6215-12-20 |pmid=21255459}}</ref>) compared standard catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) versus Ultrasound-accElerated Thrombolysis (USAT, [http://www.ekoscorp.com/ EKOS Corporation]) for the treatment of acute peripheral arterial thrombotic occlusions. Results showed that, on average, patients treated with USAT were completed 12 hours sooner than those treated with standard CDT with no increase in "serious adverse events."<ref>[http://www.ekoscorp.com/DUET%20Press%20Release%20final%20web%20version.pdf/ Randomized Controlled Multi-Center Trial Demonstrates Reduced Treatment Time and Drug Dose with EKOS vs. Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis in Peripheral Arterial Occlusions], EKOS Corporation/Bothell, WA. www.ekoscorp.com (April 15, 2013). Retrieved on April 19, 2013.</ref> Plans are underway to commence the DUET II study, which will be a non-randomized trial using the EKOS system with an even lower hourly drug dose with an expectation of further reducing bleeding complications.

==Uses==
Diseases where thrombolysis is used:
* [[Myocardial infarction]]
* [[Stroke]] (ischemic stroke)<ref name="pmid12917889">{{cite journal |author=Wardlaw JM, Zoppo G, Yamaguchi T, Berge E |editor1-last=Wardlaw |editor1-first=Joanna M |title=Thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD000213 |year=2003 |pmid=12917889 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000213}}</ref>
* Massive [[pulmonary embolism]]
* [[Acute limb ischaemia]]

Apart from streptokinase, all thrombolytic drugs are administered together with [[heparin]] (unfractionated or [[low molecular weight heparin]]), usually for 24–48 hours.

Thrombolysis is usually [[intravenous]]. It may also be used during an [[angiogram]] (intra-arterial thrombolysis), e.g. when patients present with stroke beyond three hours.

Thrombolysis is performed by many types of medical specialists, including [[interventional radiologist]]s, vascular surgeons, cardiologists, [[interventional neuroradiologist]]s, and neurosurgeons. In some settings such as the [[United States of America]], [[emergency medical technician]]s may administer thrombolytics for heart attacks in prehospital settings, by on-line medical direction. In countries with more extensive and independent qualifications, prehospital thrombolysis ([[fibrinolysis]]) may be initiated by the [[emergency care practitioner]]. Emergency Care Practitioners exist in, among other countries, [[South Africa]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[New Zealand]]. Prehospital thrombolysis is always the result of a risk benefit calculation of the heart attack, thrombolysis risks, and PPCI availability. As such, the prehospital practitioner will often consult with the receiving cardiologist as to treatment decisions—many cardiologists have personal preferences to available treatment options.

==Contraindications==
There are absolute and relative [[contraindications]] to thrombolytic therapy.

===Absolute===
Previous intracranial bleeding at any time, stroke in less than 6 months, closed head or facial trauma within 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, ischemic stroke within 3 months (except in ischemic stroke within 3 hours time), active bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled high blood pressure (>180 systolic or >100 diastolic), known structural cerebral vascular lesion, arterio-venous malformations, thrombocytopenia, known coagulation disorders, aneurysm, brain tumors, pericardial effusion.

===Relative===
Current anticoagulant use, invasive or surgical procedure in the last 2 weeks, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) defined as more than 10 minutes, known bleeding diathesis, pregnancy, hemorrhagic or diabetic retinopathies, active peptic ulcer, controlled severe hypertension.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
