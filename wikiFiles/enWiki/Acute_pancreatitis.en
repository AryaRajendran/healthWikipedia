}}</ref> is a sudden [[inflammation]] of the [[pancreas]]. It can have severe complications and high mortality despite treatment. While mild cases are often successfully treated with conservative measures, such as [[Nil per os|NPO]] (nil per os, fasting) and aggressive intravenous fluid rehydration, severe cases may require admission to the intensive care unit or even surgery to deal with complications of the disease process.

== Symptoms and signs ==

The most common symptoms and signs include:
*severe [[epigastric pain]] (upper abdominal pain) radiating to the back
*[[nausea]] 
*[[vomiting]] 
*[[diarrhea]]
*[[loss of appetite]]
*[[Fever]]
*[[chills]] (shivering)
*[[hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] instability, which include [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]
*[[tachycardia]] (rapid heartbeat)
*[[respiratory distress]]
*[[peritonitis]]

Signs which are less common, and indicate severe disease, include:
*[[Grey-Turner's sign]] (hemorrhagic discoloration of the flanks)
*[[Cullen's sign]] (hemorrhagic discoloration of the umbilicus)
*Pleural effusions (fluid in the bases of the pleural cavity)
* Grünwald sign (appearance of [[ecchymosis]], large bruise, around the umbilicus due to local toxic lesion of the vessels)
* Körte's sign (pain or resistance in the zone where the head of pancreas is located (in [[epigastrium]], 6–7&nbsp;cm above the umbilicus))
* Kamenchik's sign (pain with pressure under the [[xiphoid process]])
* Mayo-Robson's sign (pain while pressing at the top of the angle lateral to the [[Erector spinae muscles]] and below the left 12th rib (left [[Costovertebral joints|costovertebral angle]] (CVA))<ref>http://max.1gb.ru/surg/s16_pract.shtml</ref>
* Mayo-Robson's point - a point on border of inner 2/3 with the external 1/3 of the line that represents the bisection of the left upper abdominal quadrant, where tenderness on pressure exists in disease of the pancreas. At this point the tail of pancreas is projected on the abdominal wall.<ref>http://www.sgmu.ru/edu/learn/student/eman/pediatrics/investigation/digestion.pdf</ref><ref>Пропедевтика детских болезней с уходом за детьми, Капитан Т.В., 2006, page 290</ref>

Other conditions to consider are:
*[[Pancreatic pseudocyst]]
*[[Pancreatic dysfunction]] (diabetes mellitus; [[malabsorption]] due to exocrine failure)
*[[Pancreatic cancer]]

Although these are common symptoms, they are not always present. Simple abdominal pain may be the sole symptom.

=== Causes by demographic ===
The most common causes of pancreatitis, are as follows:
* Western countries: In the United States alcohol represents the primary etiology in 65% of acute pancreatitis cases (Sweden (20%), United Kingdom (5%))
* Eastern countries: gallstones
* Children: trauma
* Adolescents and young adults: mumps
* Obesity in developed countries

== Pathogenesis ==
The two types of pancreatitis are mild pancreatitis and severe pancreatitis, which are separated based on whether their predominant response to cell injury is inflammation or necrosis, respectively. In mild pancreatitis there is inflammation and edema of the pancreas.  In severe pancreatitis there are additional features of necrosis and secondary injury to extrapancreatic organs.  Both types share a common mechanism of abnormal inhibition of secretion of [[zymogens]] and inappropriate activation of pancreatic zymogens inside the pancreas, most notably [[trypsinogen]].  Normally, trypsinogen is activated to [[trypsin]] in the duodenum where it assists in the digestion of proteins.  During an acute pancreatitis episode there is colocalization of lysosomal enzymes, specifically [[cathepsin]], with trypsinogen.  Cathepsin activates trypsinogen to trypsin leading to further activation of other molecules of trypsinogen and immediate pancreatic cell death according to either the necrosis or apoptosis mechanism (or a mix between the two). The balance between these two processes is mediated by [[caspases]] which regulate apoptosis and have important anti-necrosis functions during pancreatitis: preventing trypsinogen activation, preventing ATP depletion through inhibiting polyADP-ribose polymerase, and by inhibiting the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs).  If, however, the caspases are depleted due to either chronic ethanol exposure or through a severe insult then necrosis can predominate.

As part of the initial injury there is an extensive inflammatory response due to pancreatic cells synthesizing and secreting inflammatory mediators: primarily [[TNF-alpha]] and [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]]. A hallmark of acute pancreatitis is a manifestation of the inflammatory response, namely the recruitment of neutrophils to the pancreas.  The inflammatory response leads to the secondary manifestations of pancreatitis: hypovolemia from capillary permeability, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulations, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

=== Histopathology ===
The acute pancreatitis (acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis) is characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of pancreas [[parenchyma]], focal enzymic necrosis of pancreatic fat and vessel necrosis ([[hemorrhage]]). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes. Lipase activation produces the necrosis of fat tissue in pancreatic [[interstitium]] and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (hematoxylinophilic). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. Inflammatory infiltrate is rich in [[neutrophils]]. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and necrosis can extend to include fascial layers in the immediate vicinity of the pancreas.

== Investigations and diagnosis ==
*Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed clinically but requires CT evaluation to differentiate mild acute pancreatitis from severe necrotic pancreatitis. Experienced clinicians were able to detect severe pancreatitis in approximately 34-39% of patients who later had imaging confirmed severe necrotic pancreatitis. Blood studies are used to identify organ failure, offer prognostic information, determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate, and if antibiotics are indicated.
* Blood Investigations - [[Full blood count]], [[kidney|Renal function]] tests, Liver Function, serum calcium, serum amylase and lipase, [[Arterial blood gas]], [http://web5.cns.utexas.edu/news/2011/04/blood-activated-sensor/ Trypsin-Selective Test]
*Imaging - A triple phase abdominal CT and abdominal ultrasound are together considered the gold standard for the evaluation of acute pancreatitis.  Other modalities including the abdominal xray lack sensitivity and are not recommended.  An important caveat is that imaging during the first 12 hours may be falsely reassuring as the inflammatory and necrotic process usually requires 48 hours to fully manifest.

=== Amylase and lipase, serum calcium, glycosuria ===

* Elevated serum [[amylase]] and [[lipase]] levels, in combination with severe abdominal pain, often trigger the initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. However, they have no role in assessing disease severity.
* Serum lipase rises 4 to 8 hours from the onset of symptoms and normalizes within 7 to 14 days after treatment.
* Serum amylase may be normal (in 10% of cases) for cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis (depleted acinar cell mass) and hypertriglyceridemia.
* Reasons for false positive elevated serum amylase include salivary gland disease (elevated salivary amylase), bowel obstruction, infarction, cholecystitis, and a perforated ulcer.
* If the lipase level is about 2.5 to 3 times that of amylase, it is an indication of pancreatitis due to alcohol.<ref name="pmid1718808">{{cite journal |author=Gumaste V, Dave P, Weissman D, Messer J |title=Lipase/amylase ratio.

**Decreased serum calcium
**Glycosuria

Regarding selection on these tests, two practice guidelines state:

: "It is usually not necessary to measure both serum amylase and lipase. Serum lipase may be preferable because it remains normal in some nonpancreatic conditions that increase serum amylase including macroamylasemia, parotitis, and some carcinomas. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis"<ref name="pmid17032204">{{cite journal |author=Banks P, Freeman M |title=Practice guidelines in acute pancreatitis |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=2379–400 |year=2006 |pmid=17032204 | doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00856.x}}</ref>

: "Although amylase is widely available and provides acceptable accuracy of diagnosis, where lipase is available it is preferred for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (recommendation grade A)"<ref name="pmid15831893">{{cite journal |author=UK Working Party on Acute Pancreatitis |title=UK guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis |journal=Gut |volume=54 Suppl 3 |issue=  Suppl 3|pages=iii1–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15831893 | doi=10.1136/gut.2004.057026 | url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/54/suppl_3/iii1 |pmc=1867800}}</ref>

Most (PMID 15943725, PMID 11552931, PMID 2580467, PMID 2466075, PMID 9436862), but not all (PMID 11156345, PMID 8945483) individual studies support the superiority of the lipase.

=== Computed tomography ===
[[File:Akute exsudative Pankreatitis - CT axial.jpg|thumb|Axial CT in a patient with acute exudative pancreatitis showing extensive fluid collections surrounding the pancreas.]]
Regarding the need for [[computed tomography]], practice guidelines state:

CT is an important common initial assessment tool for acute pancreatitis.  Imaging is indicated during the initial presentation if:
*the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is uncertain
*there is abdominal distension and tenderness, fever>102, or leukocytosis
*there is a Ranson score > 3 or APACHE score > 8
*there is no improvement after 72 hours of conservative medical therapy
*there has been an acute change in status: fever, pain, or shock

CT is recommended as a delayed assessment tool in the following situations:
*acute change in status
*to determine therapeutic response after surgery or interventional radiologic procedure
*before discharge in patients with severe acute pancreatitis

CT abdomen should not be performed before the 1st 12 hours of onset of symptoms as early CT (<12 h) may result in equivocal or normal findings.

CT Findings can be classified into the following categories for easy recall :
*Intrapancreatic - diffuse or segmental enlargement, edema, gas bubbles, pancreatic pseudocysts and phlegmons/abscesses (which present 4 to 6 wks after initial onset)
*Peripancreatic / extrapancreatic - irregular pancreatic outline, obliterated peripancreatic fat, retroperitoneal edema, fluid in the lessar sac, fluid in the left anterior pararenal space
*Locoregional - Gerota's fascia sign (thickening of inflamed [[Gerota's fascia]], which becomes visible), pancreatic ascites, pleural effusion (seen on basal cuts of the pleural cavity), adynamic ileus, etc.

=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===
While [[computed tomography]] is considered the gold standard in diagnostic imaging for acute pancreatitis,<ref name="pmid17363349">{{cite journal |author=Arvanitakis M, Koustiani G, Gantzarou A, Grollios G, Tsitouridis I, Haritandi-Kouridou A, Dimitriadis A, Arvanitakis C |title=Staging of severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging-a comparative study |journal=Dig Liver Dis. |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=473–482 |year=2007 |pmid=17363349 |doi=10.1016/j.dld.2007.01.015}}</ref> [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) has become increasingly valuable as a tool for the visualization of the pancreas, particularly of pancreatic fluid collections and necrotized debris.<ref name="pmid18853839">{{cite journal |author=Scaglione M, Casciani E, Pinto A, Andreoli C, De Vargas M, Gualdi GF |title=Imaging assessment of acute pancreatitis: a review |journal=Semin Ultrasound CT MR |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=322–340 |year=2008 |pmid=18853839 |doi=10.1053/j.sult.2008.06.009}}</ref>  Additional utility of MRI includes its indication for imaging of patients with an allergy to CT's contrast material, and an overall greater sensitivity to hemorrhage, vascular complications, pseudoaneurysms, and venous thrombosis.<ref name="pmid15547203">{{cite journal |author=Miller FH, Keppke AL, Dalal K, Ly JN, Kamler VA, Sica GT |title=MRI of pancreatitis and its complications: part 1, acute pancreatitis |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=183 |issue=6 |pages=1637–1644 |year=2004 |pmid=15547203}}</ref>

Another advantage of MRI is its utilization of [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP) sequences. MRCP provides useful information regarding the etiology of acute pancreatitis, i.e., the presence of tiny biliary stones ([[choledocholithiasis]] or [[cholelithiasis]]) and duct anomalies.<ref name="pmid18853839"/> Clinical trials indicate that MRCP can be as effective a diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis with biliary etiology as [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]], but with the benefits of being less invasive and causing fewer complications.<ref name="pmid18179795">{{cite journal |author=Testoni PA, Mariani A, Curioni S, Zanello A, Masci E |title=MRCP-secretin test-guided management of idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis: long-term outcomes |journal=Gastrointest Endosc |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=1028–1034 |year=2008 |pmid=18179795 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2007.09.007}}</ref><ref name="pmid12924639">{{cite journal |author=Khalid A, Peterson M, Slivka A |title=Secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance pancreaticogram to assess pancreatic duct outflow obstruction in evaluation of idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis: a pilot study |journal=Dig Dis Sci. |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=1475–1481 |year=2003 |pmid=12924639 |doi=10.1023/A:1024747319606}}</ref>

=== Endoscopic ultrasound ===

{{Main|Endoscopic ultrasound}}

== Classification by severity ==

=== Progression of pathophysiology ===
Acute pancreatitis patients recover in maximum cases.
Some may develop abscess, pseudocyst or duodenal obstruction.
In 5 percent cases, it may result in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), etc.
Acute pancreatitis can be further divided into mild and severe pancreatitis. Mostly the Ranson Criteria is used to determine severity of acute pancreatitis. In severe pancreatitis serious amount of necrosis determine the further clinical outcome. About 20% of the acute pancreatitis are severe with a mortality of about 20%. This is an important classification as severe pancreatitis will need intensive care therapy whereas mild pancreatitis can be treated on the common ward.

Necrosis will be followed by a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) and will determine the immediate clinical course. The further clinical course is then determined by bacterial infection. SIRS is the cause of bacterial (Gram negative) translocation from the patients colon.

There are several ways to help distinguish between these two forms. One is the above mentioned Ranson Score.

=== Prognostic indices ===
In predicting the prognosis, there are several scoring indices that have been used as predictors of survival. Two such scoring systems are the [[Ranson criteria]] and [[APACHE II]] (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) indices. Most,<ref name="pmi2568529">{{cite journal |author=Larvin M, McMahon M |title=APACHE-II score for assessment and monitoring of acute pancreatitis |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8656 |pages=201–5 |year=1989 |pmid=2568529 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(89)90381-4}}</ref><ref name="pmid16698595">{{cite journal |author=Yeung Y, Lam B, Yip A |title=APACHE system is better than Ranson system in the prediction of severity of acute pancreatitis |journal=Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=294–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16698595 | url=http://www.hbpdint.com/text.asp?id=837}}</ref> but not all<ref name="pmid12409825">{{cite journal |author=Chatzicostas C, Roussomoustakaki M, Vlachonikolis I, Notas G, Mouzas I, Samonakis D, Kouroumalis E |title=Comparison of Ranson, APACHE II and APACHE III scoring systems in acute pancreatitis |journal=Pancreas |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=331–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12409825  |doi=10.1097/00006676-200211000-00002}} (comment=this study used a Apache cutoff of >=10)</ref> studies report that the Apache score may be more accurate. In the negative study of the Apache II,<ref name="pmid12409825"/> the Apache II 24 hr score was used rather than the 48 hour score. In addition, all patients in the study received an ultrasound twice which may have influenced allocation of co-interventions. Regardless, only the Apache II can be fully calculated upon admission. As the Apache II is more cumbersome to calculate, presumably patients whose only laboratory abnormality is an elevated lipase or amylase do not need prognostication with the Apache II; however, this approach is not studied. The Apache II score can be calculated at [http://www.sfar.org/scores2/apache22.html www.sfar.org].

Practice guidelines state:
:2006: "The two tests that are most helpful at admission in distinguishing mild from severe acute pancreatitis are APACHE-II score and serum hematocrit. It is recommended that APACHE-II scores be generated during the first 3 days of hospitalization and thereafter as needed to help in this distinction. It is also recommended that serum hematocrit be obtained at admission, 12 h after admission, and 24 h after admission to help gauge adequacy of fluid resuscitation."<ref name="pmid17032204"/>

===Ranson Score===
{{Main|Ranson criteria}}
Ranson criteria is a clinical prediction rule for predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis. It was introduced in 1974.[1]

====At admission====

* age in years > 55 years
* white blood cell count > 16000 cells/mm3
* blood glucose > 10&nbsp;mmol/L (> 200&nbsp;mg/dL)
* serum AST > 250 IU/L
* serum LDH > 350 IU/L

====At 48 hours====

* Calcium (serum calcium < 2.0&nbsp;mmol/L (< 8.0&nbsp;mg/dL)
* Hematocrit fall >10&nbsp;mmol/l
* Oxygen (hypoxemia PO2 < 60 mmHg)
* BUN increased by 1.8 or more mmol/L (5 or more mg/dL) after IV fluid hydration
* Base deficit (negative base excess) > 4 mEq/L
* Sequestration of fluids > 6 L
The criteria for point assignment is that a certain breakpoint be met at anytime during that 48 hour period, so that in some situations it can be calculated shortly after admission. It is applicable to both gallstone and alcoholic pancreatitis.

Alternatively, pancreatitis can be diagnosed by meeting any of the following:[2]

===Ranson's score===
Ranson's score of ≥ 8
Organ failure
Substantial pancreatic necrosis (at least 30% glandular necrosis according to contrast-enhanced CT)

Interpretation
If the score ≥ 3, severe pancreatitis likely.
If the score < 3, severe pancreatitis is unlikely
Or

Score 0 to 2 : 2% mortality
Score 3 to 4 : 15% mortality
Score 5 to 6 : 40% mortality
Score 7 to 8 : 100% mortality

==== APACHE ====
{{Main|APACHE II}}

CTSI's staging of acute pancreatitis severity has been shown by a number of studies to provide more accurate assessment than APACHE II, Ranson, and [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) level.<ref name="pmid16286706">{{cite journal |author=Gürleyik G, Emir S, Kiliçoglu G, Arman A, Saglam A |title=Computed tomography severity index, APACHE II score, and serum CRP concentration for predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis |journal=JOP |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=562–567 |year=2005 |pmid=16286706}}</ref><ref name="pmid16944038">{{cite journal |author=Knoepfli AS, Kinkel K, Berney T, Morel P, Becker CD, Poletti PA |title=Prospective study of 310 patients: can early CT predict the severity of acute pancreatitis? |journal= Abdom Imaging |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=111–115 |year=2007 |pmid=16944038 |doi=10.1007/s00261-006-9034-y}}</ref><ref name="pmid16273623">{{cite journal |author=Leung TK, Lee CM, Lin SY, Chen HC, Wang HJ, Shen LK, Chen YY |title=Balthazar computed tomography severity index is superior to Ranson criteria and APACHE II scoring system in predicting acute pancreatitis outcome |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=11 |issue=38 |pages=6049–6052 |year=2005 |pmid=16273623}}</ref><ref name="pmid16183486">{{cite journal |author=Vriens PW, van de Linde P, Slotema ET, Warmerdam PE, Breslau PJ |title=Computed tomography severity index is an early prognostic tool for acute pancreatitis |journal= J Am Coll Surg |volume=201 |issue=4 |pages=497–502 |year=2005 |pmid=16183486 |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2005.06.269}}</ref> However, a few studies indicate that CTSI is not significantly associated with the prognosis of hospitalization in patients with pancreatic necrosis, nor is it an accurate predictor of AP severity.<ref name="pmid17895844">{{cite journal |author=Triantopoulou C, Lytras D, Maniatis P, Chrysovergis D, Manes K, Siafas I, Papailiou J, Dervenis C |title=Computed tomography versus Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score in predicting severity of acute pancreatitis: a prospective, comparative study with statistical evaluation |journal=Pancreas |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=238–242 |year=2007 |pmid=17895844 |doi=10.1097/MPA.0b013e3180619662}}</ref><ref name="pmid15380848">{{cite journal |author=Mortelé KJ, Mergo PJ, Taylor HM, Wiesner W, Cantisani V, Ernst MD, Kalantari BN, Ros PR |title=Peripancreatic vascular abnormalities complicating acute pancreatitis: contrast-enhanced helical CT findings |journal=Eur J Radiol |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15380848 |doi=10.1016/j.ejrad.2003.10.006}}</ref>

==== Glasgow criteria ====

The Glasgow criteria is valid for both gallstone and alcohol induced pancreatitis, whereas the Ranson score is only for alcohol induced pancreatitis. If a patient scores 3 or more it indicates severe pancreatitis and the patient should be transferred to ITU. It is scored through the mnemonic, PANCREAS:

*P - PaO2 <8kPa
*A - Age >55 years old
*N - Neutrophilia - WCC >15x10(9)/L
*C - Calcium <2&nbsp;mmol/L
*R - Renal function, Urea >16&nbsp;mmol/L
*E - Enzymes: LDH >600iu/L; AST >200iu/L
*A - Albumin <32g/L (serum)
*S - Sugar: blood glucose >10&nbsp;mmol/L

== Treatment ==

=== Pain control ===
Originally it was thought that analgesia should not be provided by [[morphine]] because it may cause spasm of the [[sphincter of Oddi]] and worsen the pain, so the drug of choice was [[meperidine]].  However, due to lack of efficacy and risk of toxicity of [[meperidine]], more recent studies have found [[morphine]] the analgesic of choice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Meperidine]] may still be used by some practitioners in more minor cases, or where morphine is contraindicated.

=== Bowel rest ===
In the management of acute pancreatitis, the treatment is to stop feeding the patient, giving him or her nothing by mouth, giving [[intravenous]] fluids to prevent [[dehydration]], and sufficient pain control. As the pancreas is stimulated to secrete [[enzyme]]s by the presence of food in the stomach, having no food pass through the system allows the pancreas to rest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Approximately 20% of patients have a relapse of pain during acute pancreatitis.<ref name="pmid17573797">{{cite journal |author=Petrov MS, van Santvoort HC, Besselink MG, Cirkel GA, Brink MA, Gooszen HG |title=Oral Refeeding After Onset of Acute Pancreatitis: A Review of Literature |journal= The American Journal of Gastroenterology|volume= 102|issue=  9|pages=2079–84; quiz 2085|year=2007 |pmid=17573797 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01357.x}}</ref> Approximately 75% of relapses occur within 48 hours of oral refeeding.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The incidence of relapse after oral refeeding may be reduced by post-pyloric enteral rather than parenteral feeding prior to oral refeeding.<ref name="pmid17573797"/> IMRIE scoring is also useful.

=== Nutritional support ===
Recently, there has been a shift in the management paradigm from TPN ([[total parenteral nutrition]]) to early, post-pyloric enteral feeding (in which a feeding tube is endoscopically or radiographically introduced to the third portion of the duodenum). The advantage of enteral feeding is that it is more physiological, prevents gut mucosal atrophy, and is free from the side effects of TPN (such as [[fungemia]]).  The additional advantages of post-pyloric feeding are the inverse relationship of pancreatic exocrine secretions and distance of nutrient delivery from the pylorus, as well as reduced risk of aspiration.

Disadvantages of a naso-enteric feeding tube include increased risk of sinusitis (especially if the tube remains in place greater than two weeks) and a still-present risk of accidentally [[tracheal intubation|intubating the trachea]] even in intubated patients (contrary to popular belief, the endotracheal tube cuff alone is not always sufficient to prevent NG tube entry into the trachea). Oxygen may be provided in some patients (about 30%) if Pao2 levels fall below 70mm of Hg.

=== Antibiotics ===
A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that antibiotics help with a [[number needed to treat]] of 11 patients to reduce mortality.<ref name="pmid17054156">{{cite journal |author=Villatoro E, Bassi C, Larvin M |title=Antibiotic therapy for prophylaxis against infection of pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue= 4|pages=CD002941 |year= 2006|pmid=17054156 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002941.pub2 |editor1-last=Larvin |editor1-first=Mike}}</ref> However, the one study in the [[meta-analysis]] that used a quinolone, and a subsequent [[randomized controlled trial]] that studied [[ciprofloxacin]] were both negative.<ref name="pmid15057739">{{cite journal |author=Isenmann R, Rünzi M, Kron M, Kahl S, Kraus D, Jung N, Maier L, Malfertheiner P, Goebell H, Beger H |title=Prophylactic antibiotic treatment in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis: a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=997–1004 |year=2004 |pmid=15057739 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2003.12.050 }}</ref>

==== Carbapenems ====
An early [[randomized controlled trial]] of [[imipenem]] 0.5&nbsp;gram intravenously every eight hours for two weeks showed a reduction in from pancreatic sepsis from 30% to 12%.<ref name="pmid8480272">{{cite journal |author=Pederzoli P, Bassi C, Vesentini S, Campedelli A |title=A randomized multicenter clinical trial of antibiotic prophylaxis of septic complications in acute necrotizing pancreatitis with imipenem |journal=Surgery, gynecology & obstetrics |volume=176 |issue=5 |pages=480–3 |year=1993 |pmid=8480272 |doi=}}</ref>

Another [[randomized controlled trial]] with patients who had at least 50% pancreatic necrosis found a benefit from [[imipenem]] compared to [[pefloxacin]] with a reduction in infected necrosis from 34% to 20%<ref name="pmid9834279">{{cite journal |author=Bassi C, Falconi M, Talamini G, ''et al.'' |title=Controlled clinical trial of pefloxacin versus imipenem in severe acute pancreatitis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=1513–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9834279 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(98)70030-7}}</ref>

A subsequent [[randomized controlled trial]] that used [[meropenem]] 1&nbsp;gram intravenously every 8 hours for 7 to 21 days stated no benefit; however, 28% of patients in the group subsequently required open antibiotic treatment vs. 46% in the placebo group. In addition, the control group had only 18% incidence of peripancreatic infections and less biliary pancreatitis that the treatment group (44% versus 24%).<ref name="pmid17457158">{{cite journal |author=Dellinger EP, Tellado JM, Soto NE, ''et al.'' |title=Early antibiotic treatment for severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=245 |issue=5 |pages=674–83 |year=2007 |pmid=17457158 |doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000250414.09255.84 |pmc=1877078}}</ref>

==== Summary ====
In summary, the role of antibiotics is controversial. One recent expert opinion (prior to the last negative trial of [[meropenem]]<ref name="pmid17457158"/>) suggested the use of [[imipenem]] if CT scan showed more than 30% necrosis of the pancreas.<ref name="pmid16707751">{{cite journal |author=Whitcomb D |title=Clinical practice. Acute pancreatitis |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=20 |pages=2142–50 |year=2006 |pmid=16707751 | doi=10.1056/NEJMcp054958 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/20/2142}}</ref>
In mild cases, antibiotics may be avoided since administering virtually any antibiotic does carry some risk in itself.

=== ERCP ===
Early '''ERCP''' ([[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]]), performed within 24 to 72 hours of presentation, is known to reduce morbidity and mortality.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Intensive Care Manual |last=Apostolakos |first=Michael J. |coauthors=Peter J. Papadakos |year=2001 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=0-07-006696-5}}</ref> The indications for early ERCP are as follows :
* Clinical deterioration or lack of improvement after 24 hours
* Detection of common bile duct stones or dilated intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts on CT abdomen
The disadvantages of ERCP are as follows :
* ERCP precipitates pancreatitis, and can introduce infection to sterile pancreatitis
* The inherent risks of ERCP i.e. bleeding

It is worth noting that ERCP itself can be a cause of pancreatitis.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is indicated for (i) infected pancreatic necrosis and (ii) diagnostic uncertainty and (iii) complications. The most common cause of death in acute pancreatitis is secondary infection. Infection is diagnosed based on 2 criteria
*Gas bubbles on CT scan (present in 20 to 50% of infected necrosis)
*Positive bacterial culture on FNA (fine needle aspiration, usually CT or US guided) of the pancreas.

Surgical options for infected necrosis include:
*Minimally invasive management - necrosectomy through small incision in skin (left flank) or stomach
*Conventional management - necrosectomy with simple drainage
*Closed management - necrosectomy with closed continuous postoperative lavage
*Open management - necrosectomy with planned staged reoperations at definite intervals (up to 20+ reoperations in some cases)

=== Other measures ===
*Pancreatic enzyme inhibitors are not proven to work.<ref>{{cite book |title=Current Obstetric & Gynecologic Diagnosis & Treatment |last=DeCherney |first=Alan H. |coauthors=Lauren Nathan |year=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=0-8385-1401-4}}</ref>
*The use of [[octreotide]] has not been shown to improve outcome.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Trauma Manual: Trauma and Acute Care Surgery |last=Peitzman |first=Andrew B. |coauthors=C. William Schwab, Donald M. Yealy, Timothy C. Fabian |year=2007 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=0-7817-6275-8}}</ref>

== Complications ==
Complications can be systemic or locoregional.
* Systemic complications include [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]], [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]], [[diffuse intravascular coagulation|DIC]], [[hypocalcemia]] (from fat saponification), [[hyperglycemia]] and [[diabetes mellitus|insulin dependent diabetes mellitus]] (from pancreatic insulin-producing [[beta cell]] damage)
* Locoregional complications include pancreatic pseudocyst (Most common, occurring in up to 25% of all cases) and phlegmon / abscess formation, splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, hemorrhage from erosions into splenic artery and vein, thrombosis of the splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein and portal veins (in descending order of frequency), duodenal obstruction, common bile duct obstruction, progression to chronic pancreatitis

== Epidemiology ==
*Annual incidence in the [[United States|U.S.]] is 18 per 100,000 population. In a European cross-sectional study, incidence of acute pancreatits increased from 12.4 to 15.9 per 100,000 annually from 1985 to 1995; however, mortality remained stable as a result of better outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eland IA, Sturkenboom MJ, Wilson JH, Stricker BH |title=Incidence and mortality of acute pancreatitis between 1985 and 1995 |journal=Scand.
