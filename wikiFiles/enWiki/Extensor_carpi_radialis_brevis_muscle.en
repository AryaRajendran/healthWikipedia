In human anatomy, '''extensor carpi radialis brevis''' is a muscle in the forearm that acts to extend and abduct the wrist.  It is shorter and thicker than its namesake [[extensor carpi radialis longus]] which can be found above the proximal end of the extensor carpi radialis brevis.

==Origin and insertion==
It arises from the [[lateral epicondyle of the humerus]], by the [[common extensor tendon]]; from the [[radial collateral ligament (elbow)|radial collateral ligament]] of the [[elbow-joint]]; from a strong [[aponeurosis]] which covers its surface; and from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles.<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' 1918, see infobox</ref>

The fibres end approximately at the middle of the forearm in the form of a flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the extensor carpi radialis longus, and accompanies it to the wrist; it passes beneath the [[abductor pollicis longus]] and [[extensor pollicis brevis]], beneath the [[extensor retinaculum of the hand|extensor retinaculum]], and inserts into the lateral dorsal surface of the base of the [[third metacarpal bone]], with a few fibres inserting into the medial dorsal surface of the [[second metacarpal bone]].<ref name="Gray's" />

==Relations==
Under the extensor retinaculum the tendon lies on the back of the radius in a shallow groove called Lister's tubercle, to the ulnar side of that which lodges the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis longus, and separated from it by a faint ridge.<ref name="Gray's" />

==Innervation==
Like all the muscles in the posterior [[forearm]], ECR brevis is supplied by a branch of the [[radial nerve]].

==Action==
It is an extensor, and an abductor of the hand at the [[wrist]] [[joint]].  That is, it serves to manipulate the wrist so that the hand moves away from the palm and towards the [[thumb]].
The muscle, like all extensors of the forearm, can be [[strength training|strengthened]] by exercise that resist its extension. A [[wrist roller]] can be used and [[wrist curl|reverse wrist curls]] with [[dumbbell]]s can be performed.
