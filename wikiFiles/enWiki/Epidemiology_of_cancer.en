The '''epidemiology of cancer''' is the study of the factors affecting [[cancer]], as a way to infer possible trends and causes.  The study of cancer [[epidemiology]] uses epidemiological methods to find the cause of [[cancer]] and to identify and develop improved treatments. 

This area of study must contend with problems of [[lead time bias]] and [[length time bias]]. Lead time bias is the concept that early diagnosis may artificially inflate the survival statistics of a cancer, without really improving the natural history of the disease. Length bias is the concept that slower growing, more indolent tumors are more likely to be diagnosed by screening tests, but improvements in diagnosing more cases of indolent cancer may not translate into better patient outcomes after the implementation of screening programs. A related concern is [[overdiagnosis]], the tendency of screening tests to diagnose diseases that may not actually impact the patient's longevity. This problem especially applies to [[prostate cancer]] and [[PSA screening]].<ref name="pmid15283896">{{cite journal |author=Brawley OW |title=Prostate cancer screening: clinical applications and challenges |journal=Urol. Oncol. |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=353–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15283896 |doi=10.1016/j.urolonc.2004.04.014}}</ref>

Some cancer researchers have argued that negative cancer clinical trials lack sufficient [[statistical power]] to discover a benefit to treatment. This may be due to fewer patients enrolled in the study than originally planned.<ref name="pmid17687153">{{cite journal |author=Bedard PL, Krzyzanowska MK, Pintilie M, Tannock IF |title=Statistical power of negative randomized controlled trials presented at American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meetings |journal=J.

== Organizations ==

State and regional [[cancer registry|cancer registries]] are organizations that abstract clinical data about cancer from patient medical records. These institutions provide information to state and national public health groups to help track trends in cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the largest and most important [[cancer registry|cancer registries]] is [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results]] (SEER), administered by the [[US Federal government]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/ |title=SEER Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results |accessdate=2007-11-02 |work=}}</ref>

== Studies ==

[[Observational study|Observational epidemiological studies]] that show associations between risk factors and specific cancers mostly serve to generate hypotheses about potential interventions that could reduce cancer incidence or [[morbidity]]. [[Randomized controlled trial]]s then test whether hypotheses generated by epidemiological studies and laboratory research actually result in reduced cancer incidence and mortality. In many cases, findings from observational [[epidemiological]] studies are not confirmed by randomized controlled trials.

== Risk factors ==

The most significant risk factor is age.  According to cancer researcher [[Robert A. Weinberg]], "If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer."<ref name=Weinberg>{{cite news 
| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/health/28cancer.html?pagewanted=all
| title = Unearthing Prehistoric Tumors, and Debate
| newspaper = ''The New York Times''
| date = 28 December 2010
| author = Johnson, George }}</ref>  Essentially all of the increase in cancer rates between prehistoric times and people who died in England between 1901 and 1905 is due to increased lifespans.<ref name=Weinberg />  Since then, some other factors, especially the increased use of tobacco, have further raised the rates.<ref name=Weinberg /> 

Over a third of cancer deaths worldwide are due to potentially modifiable risk factors. The leading modifiable risk factors worldwide are:
* [[tobacco smoking]], which is strongly associated with lung cancer, mouth, and throat cancer;
* [[alcoholic beverage|drinking alcohol]], which is associated with a small increase in oral, esophageal, breast , liver and other cancers;
* a diet low in [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]],
* physical inactivity, which is associated with increased risk of colon, breast, and possibly other cancers
* [[obesity]], which is associated with colon, breast, endometrial, and possibly other cancers
* sexual transmission of [[human papillomavirus]], which causes [[cervical cancer]] and some forms of [[anal cancer]].

Men with cancer are twice as likely as women to have a modifiable risk factor for their disease.<ref name=Danaei>{{cite journal |author= Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2}}</ref>

Other lifestyle and environmental factors known to affect cancer risk (either beneficially or detrimentally) include the use of exogenous hormones (e.g., [[hormone replacement therapy]] causes [[breast cancer]]), exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] and [[ultraviolet]] radiation, and certain occupational and chemical exposures.<ref name=Uccello>{{cite journal |author= Uccello M, Malaguarnera G, Corriere T, Biondi A, Basile F, Malaguarnera M |title= Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in workers exposed to chemicals |journal=Hepat.

Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.<ref name=WHO_occup>{{cite press release |title=WHO calls for prevention of cancer through healthy workplaces |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2007-04-27 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2007/np19/en/index.html |accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as [[pleural]] and [[peritoneal mesothelioma]]  from inhaling asbestos fibers, or [[leukemia]] from exposure to [[benzene]] at their workplaces.<ref name=WHO_occup/> Currently, most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.<ref name=WHO_occup/> It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cancer/|title=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health- Occupational Cancer |accessdate=2007-10-13|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref>

== Incidence and mortality ==
In the U.S. cancer is second only to [[cardiovascular disease]] as the leading cause of death;<ref name="Jemal"/> in the UK it is the leading cause of death.<ref name="BBC2000-news">
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1015657.stm Cancer: Number one killer] (9 November 2000). ''BBC News online''. Retrieved 2005-01-29.</ref> In many [[Third World]] countries cancer [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (insofar as this can be measured) appears much lower, most likely because of the higher death rates due to infectious disease or injury. With the increased control over [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in some Third World countries, incidence of cancer is expected to rise; in the Eastern Mediterranean region, for example, cancer incidence is expected to increase by 100% to 180% in the next 15 years due to increases in life expectancy, an increasing proportion of elderly people, and the successful control of childhood disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khatib O, Aljurf M |title=Cancer prevention and control in the Eastern Mediterranean region: the need for a public health approach |journal=Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=44–52 |year=2008 |pmid=20063528 }}</ref> This is termed the epidemiologic transition in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] terminology.

Cancer epidemiology closely mirrors risk factor spread in various countries. [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]] ([[liver]] cancer) is rare in the West but is the main cancer in China and neighbouring countries, most likely due to the [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] presence of [[hepatitis B]] and [[aflatoxin]] in that population. Similarly, with [[tobacco smoking]] becoming more common in various Third World countries, [[lung]] cancer incidence has increased in a parallel fashion.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, as of 2007, cancer is the number one cause of deaths contributing to 29.6% of all the demises in the country. The second highest cause of death is cardiovascular diseases resulting in 21.5% of deaths. Thus, cancer is a major disease affecting the population of Canada. As of 2011, the highest prevalence rate of cancer amongst males is prostate cancer (about 28% of all new cases) whereas in females its breast cancer (about 28% of all new cases). 

However, the leading cause of deaths with regards to both males and females is lung cancer which contributes to 26.8% of all deaths due to cancer. Statistics indicate that between the ages of 20 and 50 years, the incidence rate of cancer is higher amongst women whereas post 50 years of age, the incidence rate increases in men. Predictions by the Canadian Cancer Society indicate that with time, there will be an increase in the rates of incidence of cancer for both males and females. This illustrates that cancer will continue to be a persistent issue over the next few years.

=== United States ===

In the United States, cancer is responsible for 25% of all deaths with 30% of these from lung cancer. The most commonly occurring cancer in men is [[prostate cancer]] (about 25% of new cases) and in women is [[breast cancer]] (also about 25%). Cancer can occur in children and adolescents, but it is uncommon (about 150 cases per million in the U.S.), with [[leukemia]] the most common.<ref name="Jemal"/> In the first year of life the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is about 230 cases per million in the U.S., with the most common being [[neuroblastoma]].<ref>{{harvnb|SEER|1999|loc=[http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/childhood/infant.pdf Cancer among infants](PDF) pp. 149–156 }}</ref> Data from 2004-2008 in the United States indicates that the overall age-adjusted [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of cancer was approximately 460 per 100,000 men and women per year.<ref>[http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets: All Sites] by [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results]], a project of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, posted October 20, 2011</ref>

Cancer is responsible for about 25% of all deaths in the U.S., and is a major [[public health]] problem in many parts of the world. The statistics below are estimates for the U.S. in 2008, and may vary substantially in other countries. They exclude basal and squamous cell skin cancers, and [[carcinoma in situ]] in locations other than the urinary bladder.<ref name="Jemal" /> As seen, breast/prostate cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer are responsible for approximately half of cancer incidence. The same applies for cancer mortality, but with lung cancer replacing breast/prostate cancer as the main cause.

===Incidence of a second cancer in survivors===
In the developed world, one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetimes.  If all cancer patients survived and cancer occurred randomly, the normal lifetime odds of developing a second primary cancer (not the first cancer spreading to a new site) would be one in nine.<ref name=Rheingold03 />  However, [[cancer survivor]]s have an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer, and the odds are about two in nine.<ref name=Rheingold03 />  About half of these second primaries can be attributed to the normal one-in-nine risk associated with random chance.<ref name=Rheingold03 />  

The increased risk is believed to be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, such as the person's genetic profile, alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, and environmental exposures, and partly due, in some cases, to the treatment for the first cancer, which might have included mutagenic chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation.<ref name=Rheingold03 />  Cancer survivors may also be more likely to comply with recommended screening, and thus may be more likely than average to detect cancers.<ref name=Rheingold03>{{cite book

== Children ==

[[Childhood cancer]] and cancer in adolescents is rare (about 150 cases per million yearly in the US). [[Leukemia]] (usually [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]) is the most common cancer in children aged 1–14 in the U.S., followed by the [[brain tumor|central nervous system cancers]], [[neuroblastoma]], [[Wilms' tumor]], and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref name="Jemal"/> Statistics from the SEER program of the US [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]] demonstrate that childhood cancers increased 19% between 1975 and 1990, mainly due to an increased incidence in acute leukemia. Since 1990, incidence rates have decreased.<ref name="SEER1999">{{cite book |editor= Ries LAG, Smith MA, Gurney JG, Linet M, Tamra T, Young JL, Bunin GR |year=1999 |title= Cancer Incidence and Survival among Children and Adolescents, United States SEER program 1975–1995 |publisher= National Cancer Institute, SEER Program |id=NIH Pub. No. 99-4649 |location=Bethesda MD |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/childhood/ |ref={{harvid|SEER|1999}}}}</ref>

== Infants ==

The age of peak incidence of cancer in children occurs during the first year of life, in [[infant]]s.  The average annual incidence in the United States, 1975–1995, was 233 per million infants.<ref name="SEER1999"/>  Several estimates of incidence exist.  According to SEER,<ref name="SEER1999"/> in the United States:
*[[Neuroblastoma]] comprised 28% of infant cancer cases and was the most common malignancy among these young children (65 per million infants).
*The [[Leukaemia|leukemias]] as a group (41 per million infants) represented the next most common type of cancer, comprising 17% of all cases.
*[[brain tumor|Central nervous system malignancies]] comprised 13% of infant cancer, with an average annual incidence rate of nearly 30 per million infants.
*The average annual incidence rates for malignant germ cell and malignant soft tissue tumors were essentially the same at 15 per million infants.  Each comprised about 6% of infant cancer.

[[Teratoma]] (a [[germ cell tumor]]) often is cited as the most common tumor in this age group, but most teratomas are surgically removed while still benign, hence not necessarily cancer. Prior to the widespread routine use of prenatal ultrasound examinations, the incidence of [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s diagnosed at birth was 25 to 29 per million births<!-- 1:40,000 to 1:35,000 -->.

Female and male infants have essentially the same overall cancer incidence rates, a notable difference compared to older children.

White infants have higher cancer rates than black infants.  Leukemias accounted for a substantial proportion of this difference: the average annual rate for white infants (48.7 per million) was 66% higher than for
black infants (29.4 per million).<ref name="SEER1999"/>

Relative survival for infants is very good for neuroblastoma, [[Wilms' tumor]] and [[retinoblastoma]], and fairly good (80%) for leukemia, but not for most other types of cancer.
