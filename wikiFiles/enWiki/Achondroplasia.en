[[File:Las Meninas detail.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] (1656), showing Maribarbola and Nicolasito Pertusato (right), achondroplastic dwarfs in the entourage of [[Infanta Margarita]]]]
'''Achondroplasia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˌ|k|ɒ|n|d|r|ɵ|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|z|i|ə}}) is a common cause of [[dwarfism]]. It occurs as a sporadic mutation in approximately 75% of cases (associated with advanced paternal age) or may be inherited as an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[genetic disorder]]. 

People with achondroplasia have [[short stature]], with an average adult height of 131&nbsp;centimeters (51.5&nbsp;inches) (4&nbsp;ft 3.5&nbsp;in) for males and 123&nbsp;centimeters (48.4&nbsp;inches) (4&nbsp;ft 0.4&nbsp;in) for females. Achondroplastic adults are known to be as short as  62.8 cm (24.7 inches) [2&nbsp;ft 0.7&nbsp;in]. The disorder itself is caused by a change in the DNA for [[FGFR3|fibroblast growth factor receptor 3]] (FGFR3), which causes an abnormality of [[cartilage]] formation. If both parents of a child have achondroplasia, and both parents pass on the mutant gene, then it is very unlikely that the [[homozygous]] child will live past a few months of its life.  The prevalence is approximately 1 in 25,000.<ref name="pmid17879967">{{cite journal |author=Wynn J, King TM, Gambello MJ, Waller DK, Hecht JT |title=Mortality in achondroplasia study: A 42-year follow-up |journal=Am.

==Causes==

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3]] (FGFR3). In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones.  The effect is [[Dominance (genetics)|genetically dominant]], with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal before or shortly after birth. A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to [[Mutation#Spontaneous mutation|spontaneous mutation]].<ref name="pmid17950653">{{cite journal |author=Richette P, Bardin T, Stheneur C |title=Achondroplasia: From genotype to phenotype |journal=Joint Bone Spine |volume= 75|issue=  2| pages = 125–30|year=2007 |pmid=17950653 |doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2007.06.007}}</ref>

New gene mutations leading to achondroplasia are associated with [[Paternal age effect|increasing paternal age]]<ref name="pmid17706214">{{cite journal |author=Dakouane Giudicelli M, Serazin V, Le Sciellour CR, Albert M, Selva J, Giudicelli Y |title=Increased achondroplasia mutation frequency with advanced age and evidence for G1138A mosaicism in human testis biopsies |journal=Fertil Steril |volume= 89|issue= 6|pages= 1651–6|year=2007 |pmid=17706214 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.04.037}}</ref> (over 35 years old). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during [[spermatogenesis]]; it is theorized that [[oogenesis]] has some regulatory mechanism that hinders the mutation from occurring in females.

There are two other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: [[hypochondroplasia]] and [[thanatophoric dysplasia]].

=Diagnosis=

Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by the use of [[Prenatal diagnosis|prenatal]] [[ultrasound]]. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygosity]], wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to [[stillbirths]].

===Radiologic findings===
A skeletal survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow [[foramen magnum]], and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed [[spinal canal]]. The iliac wings are small and squared,<ref name="titleAchondroplasia Pelvis">{{cite web |url=http://www.stevensorenson.com/residents6/achondroplasia_pelvis.htm |title=Achondroplasia Pelvis |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022201339/http://stevensorenson.com/residents6/achondroplasia_pelvis.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with [[metaphyseal]] cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. [[Fibular]] overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short [[metacarpals]] and [[phalanges]], and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the [[radiographic]] features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often "[[Hypermobility|double jointed]]". 

The diagnosis can be made by fetal [[ultrasound]] by progressive discordance between the [[femur]] length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.''

Another distinct characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar [[Gibbus deformity|gibbus]] in infancy.

==Treatment==
At present, there is no known treatment for achondroplasia, even though the cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found.

Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, [[human growth hormone]] does not help people with achondroplasia. However, if desired, the controversial surgery of [[limb-lengthening]] will lengthen the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia.<ref name="pmid17717461">{{cite journal |author=Kitoh H, Kitakoji T, Tsuchiya H, Katoh M, Ishiguro N |title=Distraction osteogenesis of the lower extremity in patients that have achondroplasia/hypochondroplasia treated with transplantation of culture-expanded bone marrow cells and platelet-rich plasma |journal=J Pediatr Orthop |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=629–34 |year=2007 |pmid=17717461 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0b013e318093f523}}</ref>

Usually, the best results appear within the first and second year of therapy.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1210/er.21.1.23 | last1 = Vajo | first1 = Z | last2 = Francomano | first2 = CA | last3 = Wilkin | first3 = DJ | title = The molecular and genetic basis of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 disorders: the achondroplasia family of skeletal dysplasias, Muenke craniosynostosis, and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans. | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–39 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10696568}}</ref> After the second year of GH therapy, beneficial bone growth decreases.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2174/1389450033490993 | last1 = Aviezer | first1 = D | last2 = Golembo | first2 = M | last3 = Yayon | first3 = A | title = Fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 as a therapeutic target for Achondroplasia--genetic short limbed dwarfism. | journal = Current drug targets | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–65 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12816345  }}</ref> Therefore, GH therapy is not a satisfactory long term treatment.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Gene based therapy may possibly serve as a future treatment option. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. recently [http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=106657&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1662147&highlight= announced the initiation of a Phase 1 study] in healthy volunteers for BMN-111, an analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP), for the treatment of achondroplasia.

==Epidemiology==
Achondroplasia is one of 19 congenital conditions with similar presentations, such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, [[achondrogenesis]], [[osteopetrosis]], and   [[thanatophoric dysplasia]]. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births.<ref name=OMIM>{{OMIM|100800|ACHONDROPLASIA; ACH}}</ref> However, another study at the same time found a rate of 1 per 10,000.<ref name=OMIM/>

== In other species ==
Based on their disproportionate dwarfism, some [[dog]] breeds traditionally have been classified as "achondroplastic." This is the case for the [[dachshund]], [[basset hound]], and [[bulldog]] breeds.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jones, T.C.; Hunt, R.D.; |chapter=The musculoskeletal system |editor=Jones, T.C.; Hunt, R.D.; Smith, H.A. |title=Veterinary Pathology |publisher=Lea & Febiger |location=Philadelphia |year=1979 |isbn=0812107896 |pages=1175–6 |edition=5th}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Willis M.B. |chapter=Inheritance of specific skeletal and structural defects |editor=Willis M.B. |title=Genetics of the Dog |publisher=Howell Book House |location=Great Britain |year=1989 |isbn=087605551X |pages=119–120 }}</ref> Data from whole genome association studies in short-limbed dogs reveal a strong association of this trait with a retro-gene coding for fibroblast growth factor 4 [[FGF4]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parker HG, VonHoldt BM, Quignon P, ''et al.'' |title=An expressed fgf4 retrogene is associated with breed-defining chondrodysplasia in domestic dogs |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5943 |pages=995–8 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19608863 |pmc=2748762 |doi=10.1126/science.1173275 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=19608863}}</ref> Therefore, it seems unlikely that dogs and humans are achondroplastic for the same reasons. However, histological studies in some achondroplastic dog breeds have shown altered cell patterns in cartilage that are very similar to those observed in humans exhibiting achondroplasia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Braund KG, Ghosh P, Taylor TK, Larsen LH |title=Morphological studies of the canine intervertebral disc.

A similar form of achondroplasia was found in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The dwarfism was inherted dominant in the offspring from this litter. The mutants were born phenotypically normal but became more and more invalid as they reached maturity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nielsen VH, Bendixen C, Arnbjerg J, ''et al.'' |title=Abnormal growth plate function in pigs carrying a dominant mutation in type X collagen |journal=Mamm.
