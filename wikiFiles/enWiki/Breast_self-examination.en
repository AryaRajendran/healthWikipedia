'''Breast self-examination''' (BSE) is a [[breast cancer screening|screening method]] used in an attempt to detect early [[breast cancer]]. The method involves the woman herself looking at and feeling each breast for possible lumps, distortions or swelling. 

BSE was once promoted heavily as a means of finding cancer at a more curable stage, but large [[randomized controlled studies]] found that it was not effective in preventing death, and actually caused harm through needless biopsies and surgery.  The [[World Health Organization]], the US [[National Cancer Institute]], the [[US Preventive Services Task Force]], the [[Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care]], and many other scientific organizations recommend against the use of breast self-examinations.<ref>Nelson HD, Tyne K, Naik A, et al. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK36395/#ch1.s10  ''Screening for Breast Cancer: Systematic Evidence Review Update for the US Preventive Services Task Force.''] Rockville (MD): Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2009 Nov. (Evidence Syntheses, No. 74.) 1, Introduction.</ref> 

[[Breast awareness]] is an informal alternative to structured breast self-examinations.

==Limitations==
According to a [[meta-analysis]] in the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], two large trials in Russia and Shanghai found no beneficial effects of screening by breast self-examination "but do suggest increased harm in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed." They concluded, "At present, screening by breast self-examination or physical examination cannot be recommended."<ref name="pmid12804462">{{cite journal |author=Kösters JP, Gøtzsche PC |editor1-last=Kösters |editor1-first=Jan Peter |title=Regular self-examination or clinical examination for early detection of breast cancer |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003373 |year=2003 |pmid=12804462 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003373 |url=}}</ref>

Although breast self-examination increases the number of biopsies performed on women, and thus revenue for the [[breast cancer industry]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}, it does not reduce [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] from breast cancer. In a large clinical trial involving more than 260,000 female Chinese factory workers, half were carefully taught by nurses at their factories to perform monthly breast self-exam, and the other half were not. The women taught self-exam detected more [[Benign breast disease|benign]] (normal or harmless lumps) or early-stage breast disease, but equal numbers of women died from breast cancer in each group.<ref name="pmid12359854">{{cite journal |author=Thomas DB, Gao DL, Ray RM, ''et al.'' |title=Randomized trial of breast self-examination in Shanghai: final results |journal=J.

Because breast self-exam is not proven to save lives, it is no longer routinely recommended by health authorities for general use.<ref name="pmid12359843">{{cite journal |author=Harris R, Kinsinger LS |title=Routinely teaching breast self-examination is dead.

Breast self-examinations are based on an incorrect theory of cancer development, which assumes steady growth of the tumor.

Among women with high-risk [[BRCA mutation]]s, about 10% said that performing breast self-examination increased their anxiety. Half of those who did perform BSE felt that it gave them a sense of control.<ref>{{cite journal

Learning breast self-examination increases a woman's level of depression, worrying, and anxiety about breast cancer.<ref name=Baxter />  Greater anxiety about breast cancer is associated with a higher likelihood of performing breast self-examination.  Women are also more likely to perform breast self-examination if they have experienced a [[false positive]] error from screening mammography (being wrongly told that breast cancer may be present, when the woman is actually cancer-free).<ref>{{cite journal

==Methods==
[[Image:Breast self-exam NCI visuals online.jpg|thumb|An pictorial example of breast self-examination in six steps. Steps 1-3 involve inspection of the breast with the arms hanging next to the body, behind the head and in the side. Step 4 is palpation of the breast. Step 5 is palpation of the nipple. Step 6 is palpation of the breast while lying down.]]

A variety of methods and patterns are used in breast self-exams.  Most methods suggest that the woman stand in front of a mirror with the torso exposed to view.  She looks in the mirror for visual signs of dimpling, swelling, or redness on or near the breasts.  This is usually repeated in several positions, such as while having hands on the hips, and then again with arms held overhead.

The woman then [[palpate]]s her breasts with the pads of her fingers to feel for lumps (either superficial or deeper in tissue) or soreness.  There are several common patterns, which are designed to ensure complete coverage. The vertical strip pattern involves moving the fingers up and down over the breast. The pie-wedge pattern starts at the nipple and moves outward. The circular pattern involves moving the fingers in concentric circles from the nipple outward.  Some guidelines suggest mentally dividing the breast into four quadrants and checking each quadrant separately.  The palpation process covers the entire breast, including the "[[axillary tail]]" of each breast that extends toward the [[axilla]] (armpit).  This is usually done once while standing in front of the mirror and again while lying down.  

Finally, women that are not [[breastfeeding]] gently squeeze each nipple to check for any [[nipple discharge|discharge]].

Various [[wikt:mnemonic|mnemonic]] devices are used as teaching devices.  One is called the ''seven P's of BSE'', after seven steps that are named to have the same first initial:  ''Positions'', ''Perimeter'', ''Palpation'', ''Pressure'', ''Pattern'',  ''Practice'', and ''Planning'' what to do if a change is found in the breast tissue.

For [[menopause|pre-menopausal]] women, most methods suggest that the self-exam be performed at the same stage of the woman's [[menstrual cycle]], because the normal hormone fluctuations can cause changes in the breasts. The most commonly recommended time is just after the end of [[menstruation]], because the breasts are least likely to be swollen and tender at this time.  Women who are postmenopausal or have irregular cycles might do a self-exam once a month regardless of their menstrual cycle.

A correctly performed breast self-examination normally takes a trained professional seven to ten minutes.<ref>{{cite journal
