A '''hormone''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὁρμή}}, "impetus") is a chemical released by  a cell, a gland, or an organ in one part of the body that affects cells in other parts of the organism. Only a small amount of hormone is required to alter cell [[metabolism]]. In essence, it is a chemical messenger that transports a signal from one cell to another.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hormones|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hormones.html}}</ref>  All [[multicellular organism]]s produce hormones; [[plant hormone]]s are also called [[phytohormone]]s. Hormones in [[animal]]s are often transported in the blood. Cells respond to a hormone when they [[gene expression|express]] a specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for that hormone. The hormone binds to the receptor [[protein]], resulting in the activation of a [[signal transduction]] mechanism that ultimately leads to cell type-specific responses.

[[endocrine system|Endocrine]] hormone [[molecule]]s are secreted (released) directly into the [[bloodstream]], typically into [[Capillary#Types|fenestrated capillaries]]. Hormones with [[paracrine]] function diffuse through the [[interstitial]] spaces to nearby target tissues.

A variety of [[exogenous]] [[chemical compound]]s, both natural and synthetic, have hormone-like effects on both humans and wildlife. Their [[Endocrine disruptor|interference]] with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body can change the [[homeostasis]], reproduction, development, and/or behavior, just as [[endogenous|endogenously]] produced hormones do.<ref name="pmid9539004">{{cite journal | author = Crisp TM, Clegg ED, Cooper RL, Wood WP, Anderson DG, Baetcke KP, Hoffmann JL, Morrow MS, Rodier DJ, Schaeffer JE, Touart LW, Zeeman MG, Patel YM | title =  Environmental endocrine disruption: An effects assessment and analysis | journal = Environ.

== Hormones as signals ==
''See also [[Signal transduction]].''

Hormonal signaling involves the following:{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
# '''[[Biosynthesis]]''' of a particular hormone in a particular tissue
# '''Storage and [[Cellular secretion|secretion]]''' of the hormone
# '''Transport''' of the hormone to the target cell(s)
# '''Recognition''' of the hormone by an [[membrane protein|associated cell membrane]] or [[intracellular]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein
# '''Relay and amplification''' of the received hormonal signal via a [[signal transduction]] process: This then leads to a cellular response. The reaction of the target cells may then be recognized by the original hormone-producing cells, leading to a [[down-regulation]] in hormone production. This is an example of a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[negative feedback loop]].
# '''Degradation''' of the hormone.

Hormone cells are typically of a specialized cell type, residing within a particular [[endocrine system|endocrine gland]], such as [[thyroid gland]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and [[testes]]. Hormones exit their cell of origin via [[exocytosis]] or another means of [[cell membrane|membrane transport]]. The hierarchical model is an oversimplification of the hormonal signaling process. Cellular recipients of a particular hormonal signal may be one of several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues, as is the case for [[insulin]], which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects. Different tissue types may also respond differently to the same hormonal signal. Because of this, hormonal signaling is elaborate and hard to dissect.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

== Interactions with receptors ==
Most hormones initiate a cellular response by initially combining with either a specific [[intracellular]] or [[membrane protein|cell membrane associated]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein. A cell may have several different receptors that recognize the same hormone and activate different [[signal transduction]] pathways, or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway.
  
For many hormones, including most [[protein hormone]]s, the receptor is membrane-associated and embedded in the [[plasma membrane]] at the surface of the cell. The interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, often involving [[phosphorylation]] or dephosphorylation of various other cytoplasmic proteins, changes in [[ion channel]] permeability, or increased concentrations of intracellular molecules that may act as [[second messenger|secondary messengers]] (e.g., [[cyclic AMP]]). Some [[protein hormone]]s also interact with [[intracellular]] receptors located in the [[cytoplasm]] or [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] by an [[intracrine]] mechanism.

For hormones such as [[Steroid hormone|steroid]] or [[Thyroid hormone|thyroid]] hormones, their receptors are located [[intracellular]]ly within the [[cytoplasm]] of their target cell. To bind their receptors, these hormones must cross the cell membrane. They can do so because they are lipid-soluble. The combined hormone-receptor [[protein complex|complex]] then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to specific [[DNA sequences]], effectively amplifying or suppressing the action of certain [[genes]], and affecting [[protein synthesis]].<ref name=beato>{{cite journal | author =Beato M, Chavez S and Truss M | title = Transcriptional regulation by steroid hormones | journal = Steroids | year=1996 | volume=61 | issue=4 | pages=240–251 | pmid = 8733009 | doi = 10.1016/0039-128X(96)00030-X}}</ref> However, it has been shown that not all steroid receptors are located [[intracellular]]ly. Some are associated with the [[plasma membrane]].<ref name=hammes>{{cite journal | author =Hammes SR | title = The further redefining of steroid-mediated signaling | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  | year=2003 | volume=100 | issue=5 | pages=21680–2170 | pmid = 12606724 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0530224100 | pmc =151311}}</ref>

An important consideration, dictating the level at which cellular [[signal transduction]] pathways are activated in response to a hormonal signal, is the effective [[concentration]] of hormone-receptor complexes that are formed. Hormone-receptor complex concentrations are effectively determined by three factors:

# The number of hormone molecules available for complex formation
# The number of receptor molecules available for complex formation
# The [[Dissociation_constant#Protein-ligand_binding|binding affinity]] between hormone and receptor.
 
The number of hormone molecules available for complex formation is usually the key factor in determining the level at which [[signal transduction]] pathways are activated, the number of hormone molecules available being determined by the concentration of circulating hormone, which is in turn influenced by the level and rate at which they are secreted by biosynthetic cells. The number of receptors at the cell surface of the receiving cell can also be varied, as can the [[dissociation constant#protein ligand binding|affinity]] between the hormone and its receptor.

== Physiology of hormones ==
Most cells are capable of producing one or more molecules, which act as signaling molecules to other cells, altering their growth, function, or metabolism. The classical hormones produced by cells in the [[endocrine gland]]s mentioned so far in this article are cellular products, specialized to serve as regulators at the overall organism level. However, they may also exert their effects solely within the tissue in which they are produced and originally released.

The rate of hormone biosynthesis and secretion is often regulated by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[negative feedback]] control mechanism. Such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the [[metabolism]] and [[excretion]] of hormones. Thus, higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger the negative feedback mechanism. Negative feedback must be triggered by overproduction of an "effect" of the hormone.

Hormone secretion can be stimulated and inhibited by:
* Other hormones (''stimulating''- or ''releasing'' -hormones)
* Plasma concentrations of ions or nutrients, as well as binding [[globulin]]s
* [[Neuron]]s and mental activity
* Environmental changes, e.g., of light or temperature

One special group of hormones is the [[tropic hormone]]s that stimulate the hormone production of other [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]].  For example, [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) causes growth and increased activity of another endocrine gland, the [[thyroid]], which increases output of [[thyroid hormone]]s.

A recently identified class of hormones is that of the "hunger hormones" - [[ghrelin]], [[orexin]], and [[PYY 3-36]] - and "satiety hormones" - e.g., [[cholecystokinin]], [[leptin]], [[nesfatin-1]], [[obestatin]]. 

To release active hormones quickly into the [[Circulatory system|circulation]], hormone biosynthetic cells may produce and store biologically inactive hormones in the form of [[prehormone|pre-]] or [[prohormone]]s. These can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus.

== Effects of hormones ==
=== In mammals ===
Hormones have the following effects on the body:

* stimulation or inhibition of growth
* [[mood swings]]
* induction or suppression of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death)
* activation or inhibition of the [[immune system]]
* regulation of [[metabolism]]
* preparation of the body for [[mating]], [[fighting]], [[fleeing]], and other activity
* preparation of the body for a new phase of life, such as [[puberty]], [[parenting]],  and [[menopause]]
* control of the [[reproductive cycle]]
* hunger cravings
* [[sexual arousal]]

A hormone may also regulate the production and release of other hormones. Hormone signals control the internal environment of the body through [[homeostasis]].

== Chemical classes of hormones ==
[[Vertebrate]] hormones fall into three chemical classes:

* [[Peptide hormone]]s consist of chains of amino acids. Examples of small peptide hormones are [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone|TRH]] and [[vasopressin]]. Peptides composed of scores or hundreds of amino acids are referred to as [[protein]]s. Examples of protein hormones include [[insulin]] and [[growth hormone]]. More complex protein hormones bear [[carbohydrate]] side-chains and are called [[glycoprotein]] hormones. [[Luteinizing hormone]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] are glycoprotein hormones. There is also another type of hydrophilic hormone called ''nonpeptide'' hormones. Although they don't have peptide connections, they are assimilated as peptide hormones.
* [[Lipid]] and [[phospholipid]]-derived hormones derive from lipids such as [[linoleic acid]] and [[arachidonic acid]] and phospholipids. The main classes are the [[steroid hormones]] that derive from [[cholesterol]] and the [[eicosanoid]]s. Examples of [[steroid hormones]] are [[testosterone]] and [[cortisol]]. [[Sterol]] hormones such as [[calcitriol]] are a [[homology (biology)|homologous]] system. The [[adrenal cortex]] and the [[gonad]]s are primary sources of steroid hormones. Examples of [[eicosanoid]]s are the widely studied [[prostaglandin]]s.
* [[Monoamine]]s derived from aromatic [[amino acid]]s like [[phenylalanine]], [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]] by the action of [[aromatic amino acid decarboxylase]] [[enzyme]]s.

== Pharmacology ==
Many hormones and their [[analog (chemistry)|analogues]] are used as [[medication]]. The most commonly prescribed hormones are [[estrogen]]s and [[progestagen]]s (as methods of [[hormonal contraception]] and as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|HRT]]), [[thyroxine]] (as [[levothyroxine]], for [[hypothyroidism]]) and [[steroid]]s (for [[autoimmune disease]]s and several [[pulmonology|respiratory disorders]]). [[Insulin]] is used by many [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]]. Local preparations for use in [[otolaryngology]] often contain [[pharmacology|pharmacologic]] equivalents of [[adrenaline]], while [[steroid]] and [[vitamin D]] creams are used extensively in [[dermatology|dermatological]] practice.

A "pharmacologic dose" or "supraphysiological dose" of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body. The effects of pharmacologic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutically useful, though not without potentially adverse side effects. An example is the ability of pharmacologic doses of [[glucocorticoid]]s to suppress [[inflammation]].
