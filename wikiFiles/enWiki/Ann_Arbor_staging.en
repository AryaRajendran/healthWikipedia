'''Ann Arbor staging''' is the [[Cancer staging|staging]] system for [[lymphoma]]s, both in [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (previously called Hodgkin's disease) and [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (abbreviated NHL). It was initially developed for Hodgkin's, but has some use in NHL. It has roughly the same function as [[TNM staging system|TNM]] staging in solid tumors.

The stage depends on both the place where the malignant tissue is located (as located with [[biopsy]], [[CT scan]]ning and increasingly [[positron emission tomography]]) and on systemic symptoms due to the lymphoma ("[[B symptoms]]": [[sleep hyperhidrosis|night sweats]], [[weight loss]] of >10% or [[fever]]s).

==Principal stages==
The principal stage is determined by location of the tumor:
* ''Stage I'' indicates that the cancer is located in a single region, usually one lymph node and the surrounding area. Stage I often will not have outward symptoms.
* ''Stage II'' indicates that the cancer is located in two separate regions, an affected lymph node or organ and a second affected area, and that both affected areas are confined to one side of the diaphragm - that is, both are above the diaphragm, or both are below the diaphragm.
* ''Stage III'' indicates that the cancer has spread to both sides of the diaphragm, including one organ or area near the lymph nodes or the spleen.
* ''Stage IV'' indicates diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, including any involvement of the liver, bone marrow, or nodular involvement of the lungs.

==Modifiers==
These letters can be appended to some stages:
* ''A'' or ''B:'' the absence of constitutional (B-type) symptoms is denoted by adding an "A" to the stage; the presence is denoted by adding a "B" to the stage.
* ''E:'' is used if the disease is "extranodal" (not in the [[lymph node]]s) or has spread from lymph nodes to adjacent tissue.
* ''X:'' is used if the largest deposit is >10&nbsp;cm large ("bulky disease"), or whether the [[mediastinum]] is wider than 1/3 of the chest on a [[chest X-ray]].
* ''S:'' is used if the disease has spread to the [[spleen]].

==Type of staging==
The nature of the staging is (occasionally) expressed with:
* ''CS'' - clinical stage as obtained by doctor's examinations and tests. 
* ''PS'' - pathological stage as obtained by exploratory laparotomy (surgery performed through an abdominal incision) with splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen). Note: exploratory laparotomy has fallen out of favor for lymphoma staging.

==Limitations==
The staging does not take into account the ''grade'' (biological behavior) of the tumor tissue. The [[Prognosis|prognostic significance]] of bulky disease, and some other modifiers, were introduced with the "Cotswolds modification".<ref name="pmid2809679">{{cite journal |author=Lister TA, Crowther D, Sutcliffe SB, ''et al.'' |title=Report of a committee convened to discuss the evaluation and staging of patients with Hodgkin's disease: Cotswolds meeting |journal=J.

==History==
The Ann Arbor classification is named after [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], where the Committee on Hodgkin's Disease Staging Classification met in 1971;<ref name="pmid5121694">{{cite journal |author=Carbone PP, Kaplan HS, Musshoff K, Smithers DW, Tubiana M |title=Report of the Committee on Hodgkin's Disease Staging Classification |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=1860–1 |year=1971 |month=November |pmid=5121694 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5121694}}</ref> it consisted of experts from the [[USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]] and [[France]], and replaced the older Rye classification from a 1965 meeting.<ref> Rosenberg SA.
