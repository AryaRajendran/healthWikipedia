The '''associated features of bipolar disorder''' are clinical phenomena that often accompany [[bipolar disorder]] (BD) but are not part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. There are several childhood precursors in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. They may show subtle early traits such as mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]].<ref name="pmid2504732">{{cite journal |author=Andreoli TE |title=Molecular aspects of endocrinology |journal=Hosp.

==Childhood precursors==
Some limited long-term studies indicate that children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder may show subtle early traits such as subthreshold cyclical mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and possibly [[ADHD]] with mood fluctuation. There may be hypersensitivity and irritability. There is some disagreement whether the experiences are necessarily fluctuating or may be chronic.<ref name="Miklowitz2008">David J.

==Cognitive functioning==
{{further2|[[Creativity and mental illness]]}}
Reviews have indicated that most individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but who are [[euthymia (medicine)|euthymic]] (not experiencing major depression or mania), do not show [[neuropsychological]] deficits on most tests.<ref name="Mansell2008" /> [[Meta-analyses]] have indicated, by averaging the variable findings of many studies, [[cognitive deficits]] on some measures of sustained [[attention]], [[executive function]] and [[declarative memory|verbal memory]], in terms of group averages. On some tests, functioning is superior; however,<ref name="Mansell2008" /> and sub-threshold mood states and psychiatric medications may account for some deficits.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16677713 | doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.02.016 | volume=93 | issue=1-3 | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | year=2006 | title = A meta-analysis of cognitive deficits in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder | month=July | pages=105–15 | author=Robinson LJ, Thompson JM, Gallagher P, ''et al.'' | ref = harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17688459 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01055.x | issue=434 | volume = 116 | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | year=2007 | title = Neuropsychological functioning in euthymic bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis | pages=17–26 | author=Torres IJ, Boudreau VG, Yatham LN | ref = harv}}</ref> A 2010 study found that "excellent performance" at school at age 15–16 was associated in males with a higher rate of developing bipolar disorder, but so was the poorest performance.<ref name="pmid20118454">{{Cite journal|author=MacCabe JH, Lambe MP, Cnattingius S, ''et al.'' |title=Excellent school performance at age 16 and risk of adult bipolar disorder: national cohort study |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=2 |pages=109–15 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20118454 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.060368 |url=|ref=harv}}</ref> A 2005 study of young adult males found that poor performance on [[visuospatial]] tasks was associated with a higher rate of developing bipolar disorder, but so was high performance in [[arithmetic]] reasoning.<ref name="pmid16199837">{{Cite journal|author=Tiihonen J, Haukka J, Henriksson M, ''et al.'' |title=Premorbid intellectual functioning in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: results from a cohort study of male conscripts |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=10 |pages=1904–10 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16199837 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.10.1904 |url=|ref=harv}}</ref>

Psychological studies of bipolar disorder have examined the development of a wide range of both the core symptoms of psychomotor activation and related clusterings of depression/anxiety, increased [[hedonic]] tone, irritability/aggression and sometimes psychosis. The existing evidence has been described as patchy in terms of quality but converging in a consistent manner. The findings suggest that the period leading up to mania is often characterized by depression and anxiety at first, with isolated sub-clinical symptoms of mania such as increased energy and racing thoughts. The latter increase and lead to increased activity levels, the more so if there is disruption in [[circadian rhythms]] or goal attainment events. There is some indication that once mania has begun to develop, social [[stress (biological)|stressors]], including criticism from significant others, can further contribute. There are also indications that individuals may hold certain beliefs about [[self|themselves]], their internal states, and their [[social world]] (including striving to meet high standards despite it causing distress) that may make them vulnerable during changing mood states in the face of relevant life events. In addition, subtle frontal-temporal and subcortical difficulties in ''some'' individuals, related to planning, emotional regulation and attentional control, may play a role. Symptoms are often subthreshold and likely continuous with normal experience. Once (hypo)mania has developed, there is an overall increase in [[arousal|activation]] levels and [[impulsivity]]. Negative social reactions or advice may be taken less notice of, and a person may be more caught up in their own thoughts and interpretations, often along a theme of feeling criticised. There is some suggestion that the mood variation in bipolar disorder may not be cyclical as often assumed, nor completely random, but results from a complex interaction between internal and external variables unfolding over time; there is mixed evidence as to whether relevant life events are found more often in early than later episodes.<ref name="Mansell2008"/> Many sufferers report inexplicably varied cyclical patterns, however.<ref>Manic-depressive illness FK Goodwin, KR Jamison&nbsp;– 1990&nbsp;– Oxford University Press New York</ref>

A series of authors have described mania or hypomania as being related to a high [[motivation]] to achieve, ambitious [[goal]]-setting, and sometimes high achievement. One study indicated that the pursuit of goals, encouraged by sometimes achieving them, can become [[emotional dysregulation|emotionally dysregulated]] and involve the development of mania.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johnson SL |title=Mania and dysregulation in goal pursuit: a review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=241–62 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15642648 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.11.002 |url= |pmc=2847498|ref=harv}}</ref> Individuals may have low [[self-esteem]] and difficulties in social [[adjustment]], however, and by definition there are periods of depression with difficulty in motivation and functioning.<ref name="pmid15023484">{{Cite journal|author=Blairy S, Linotte S, Souery D, ''et al.'' |title=Social adjustment and self-esteem of bipolar patients: a multicentric study |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=79 |issue=1–3 |pages=97–103 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15023484 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00347-6 |url=|ref=harv}}</ref>

Bipolar disorder has been associated with people involved in the [[arts]] but it is an ongoing question as to whether many creative [[genius]]es had bipolar disorder.<ref>Jamison, K R, ''Touched with Fire'', Free Press, 1993, pp 83 ff.</ref><ref>Goodwin, F, and Jamison, K R, ''Manic-Depressive Illness'', Oxford University Press, 1990, p 353</ref> Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and [[creativity]], although it is unclear in which direction the cause lies or whether both conditions are caused by a third unknown factor; [[temperament]] has been hypothesized to be one such factor.<ref name="pmid20936438"/>

==Self-medication==
Often bipolar individuals are subject to [[self-medication]] with non-prescribed drugs such as [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]] and other [[recreational drug]]s.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3109/10673229809000321}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00454-8}}</ref>

There is some evidence that, although bipolar patients in general do not appear to smoke significantly more than other people, the subset of bipolar patients with a history of psychosis may smoke more heavily than the general population.<ref>{{cite pmid|11435266}}</ref>
