'''Graves' disease''' is an [[autoimmune]] disease. It most commonly affects the [[thyroid]], frequently causing it to enlarge to twice its size or more ([[goiter]]), become overactive, with related [[hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroid symptoms]] such as increased heartbeat, muscle weakness, disturbed sleep, and irritability. It can also [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|affect the eyes]], causing bulging eyes ([[exophthalmos]]). It affects other systems of the body, including the skin, heart, circulation and nervous system.

It affects up to 2% of the female population, sometimes appears after childbirth, and has a female:male incidence of 5:1 to 10:1. It has a strong [[hereditary]] component; when one identical twin has Graves' disease, the other twin will have it 25% of the time. Smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke is associated with the eye manifestations but not the thyroid manifestations.

Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of symptoms, although thyroid hormone tests may be useful, particularly to monitor treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/24/2594 |title=Brent GA.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Symptoms and signs of Graves' disease}}
[[Image:HyperaldosteronismSymptoms.jpeg|thumb|Graves' disease symptoms]]
The signs and symptoms of Graves' disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of [[hyperthyroidism]], with main exceptions being [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], [[goitre]], and [[pretibial myxedema]] (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly [[insomnia]], hand [[tremor]], [[hyperactivity]], hair loss, excessive [[sweating]], shaking hands, itching, heat intolerance, [[weight loss]] despite [[increased appetite]], [[diarrhea]], frequent [[defecation]], [[palpitation]]s, [[muscle weakness]], and skin warmth and moistness.<ref name=agabegi2nd157>page 157 in:{{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S.|title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD|year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Further signs that may be seen on [[physical examination]] are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, [[lid lag]], excessive [[tears|lacrimation]] due to Graves' ophthalmopathy, [[arrhythmia]]s of the heart, such as [[sinus tachycardia]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and [[premature ventricular contraction]]s, and [[hypertension]].<ref name=agabegi2nd157/> People with hyperthyroidism may experience behavioral and personality changes including: [[psychosis]], [[mania]], [[anxiety]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bunevicius|first=R|coauthors=Prange AJ, Jr|title=Psychiatric manifestations of Graves' hyperthyroidism: pathophysiology and treatment options.|journal=CNS drugs|year=2006|volume=20|issue=11|pages=897–909|pmid=17044727|doi=10.2165/00023210-200620110-00003}}</ref>

==Cause==
The trigger for auto-antibody production is not known. There appears to be a [[genetics|genetic]] predisposition for Graves' disease, suggesting that some people are more prone than others to develop TSH receptor activating antibodies due to a genetic cause. [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] DR (especially DR3) appears to play a significant role.<!--
  --><ref name="EndocrReview1993">{{cite journal | author = Tomer Y, Davies T | title = Infection, thyroid disease, and autoimmunity | journal = Endocr Rev | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–20 | year = 1993 |pmid = 8491150 | url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/1/107.pdf | format=PDF | doi = 10.1210/er.14.1.107}}</ref>

Since Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease which appears suddenly, often quite late in life, it is thought that a [[Virus|viral]] or [[bacteria]]l infection may trigger antibodies which cross-react with the human TSH receptor (a phenomenon known as [[antigenic mimicry]], also seen in some cases of [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
. 

One possible culprit is the bacterium ''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]'' (a cousin of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', the agent of bubonic plague). However, although there is indirect evidence for the structural similarity between the bacteria and the human thyrotropin receptor, direct causative evidence is limited.<!--
  --><ref name="EndocrReview1993"/>
''Yersinia'' seems not to be a major cause of this disease, although it may contribute to the development of thyroid autoimmunity arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Toivanen P, Toivanen A | title = Does Yersinia induce autoimmunity? |journal = Int Arch Allergy Immunol | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–11 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8199453 | doi = 10.1159/000236717}}</ref>
It has also been suggested that ''Y. enterocolitica'' infection is not the cause of auto-immune thyroid disease, but rather is only an [[Association (statistics)|associated]] condition; with both having a shared inherited susceptibility.<!-- yes this is true

Emotional stress has been posited as a possible cause of Graves' disease as well, based largely on [[anecdotal evidence]]. While there are theoretical mechanisms by which stress could cause an aggravation of the autoimmune response that leads to Graves' disease, more robust clinical data are needed for a firm conclusion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Falgarone G, Heshmati HM, Cohen R, Reach G |title=Mechanisms in endocrinology. Role of emotional stress in the pathophysiology of Graves' disease |journal=Eur. J. Endocrinol. |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=R13–8 |year=2013 |pmid=23027804 |doi=10.1530/EJE-12-0539 |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Graves' disease may present clinically with one of the following characteristic signs:
*[[exophthalmos]] (protuberance of one or both eyes)
*fatigue, weight loss with increased appetite, and other symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]]/[[thyrotoxicosis]]
*rapid heart beats
*muscular weakness

The two signs that are truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease ''(i.e.,'' not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions) are [[exophthalmos]] and non-pitting edema ([[pretibial myxedema]]). Goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (''i.e.,'' spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goitre may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease is the most common cause of diffuse goitre. A large goitre will be visible to the naked eye, but a small goitre (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical exam. Occasionally, goitre is not clinically detectable but may be seen only with [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[ultrasound]] examination of the thyroid. 

Another sign of Graves' disease is [[hyperthyroidism]], ''i.e.'', overproduction of the [[thyroid hormone]]s T3 and T4. Normothyroidism is also seen, and occasionally also [[hypothyroidism]], which may assist in causing goitre (though it is not the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4. 

Other useful laboratory measurements in Graves' disease include [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH, usually low in Graves' disease due to [[negative feedback]] from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound [[iodine]] (elevated). Thyroid-stimulating antibodies may also be detected [[serology|serologically]]. 

[[Biopsy]] to obtain histiological testing is not normally required but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed.<!-- see eMedicine/med/topic929 of infobox -->

Differentiating two common forms of hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease and [[Toxic multinodular goiter]] is important to determine proper treatment. Measuring TSH-receptor antibodies with the h-TBII assay has been proven efficient and was the most practical approach found in one study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wallaschofski H, Kuwert T, Lohmann T |title=TSH-receptor autoantibodies - differentiation of hyperthyroidism between Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter |journal=Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=171–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15127319 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-817930 |url=}}</ref>

===Eye disease===
{{Further|Graves' ophthalmopathy|}}
Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is one of the most typical symptoms of Graves' disease. It is known by a variety of terms, the most common being [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]]. Thyroid eye disease is an inflammatory condition, which affects the orbital contents including the [[extraocular muscles]] and orbital fat. It is almost always associated with Graves' disease but may rarely be seen in [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], primary [[hypothyroidism]], or [[thyroid cancer]].

The ocular manifestations that are relatively specific to Graves' disease include soft tissue inflammation, proptosis (protrusion of one or both globes of the eyes), [[cornea]]l exposure, and [[optic nerve]] compression. Also seen, if the patient is hyperthyroid, (''i.e.'', has too much thryoid hormone) are more general manifestations, which are due to hyperthyroidism itself and which may be seen in any conditions that cause hyperthyroidism (such as toxic multinodular goitre or even thyroid poisoning). These more general symptoms include lid retraction, lid lag, and a delay in the downward excursion of the upper eyelid, during downward gaze.

It is believed that fibroblasts in the orbital tissues may express the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone receptor (TSHr). This may explain why one autoantibody to the TSHr can cause disease in both the thyroid and the eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/thy.2007.0185 |title=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. - Thyroid - 17(10):1013 |doi=10.1089/thy.2007.0185 |publisher=Liebertonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref>

*For mild disease - [[artificial tear]]s, steroids  (to reduce [[chemosis]])
*For moderate disease - lateral [[tarsorrhaphy]]
*For severe disease - orbital decompression or retro-orbital radiation

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Hyperthyroidism (2).jpg|thumb|Histopathological image of diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (clinically presenting as hyperthyroidism)]]
Graves' disease is an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorder, in which the body produces [[antibody|antibodies]] to the [[TSH receptor|receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)]]. (Antibodies to thyroglobulin and to the [[thyroid hormone]]s T3 and T4 may also be produced.)

These antibodies cause [[hyperthyroidism]] because they bind to the TSH receptor and [[chronic (medicine)|chronically]] stimulate it. The TSH receptor is expressed on the [[follicular cells]] of the thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), and the result of chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This in turn causes the clinical symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]], and the enlargement of the thyroid gland visible as [[goitre]].

The infiltrative [[exophthalmos]] that is frequently encountered has been explained by postulating that the thyroid gland and the extraocular muscles share a common antigen which is recognized by the antibodies. Antibodies binding to the extraocular muscles would cause swelling behind the eyeball.

The "orange peel" skin has been explained by the infiltration of antibodies under the skin, causing an inflammatory reaction and subsequent fibrous plaques.

There are 3 types of autoantibodies to the TSH receptor currently recognized:

*''TSI'', Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins: these antibodies (mainly IgG) act as LATS (Long Acting Thyroid Stimulants), activating the cells in a longer and slower way than TSH, leading to an elevated production of thyroid hormone.

*''TGI'', Thyroid growth immunoglobulins: these antibodies bind directly to the TSH receptor and have been implicated in the growth of thyroid follicles.

*''TBII'', Thyrotrophin Binding-Inhibiting Immunoglobulins: these antibodies inhibit the normal union of TSH with its receptor. Some will actually act as if TSH itself is binding to its receptor, thus inducing thyroid function. Other types may not stimulate the thyroid gland, but will prevent TSI and TSH from binding to and stimulating the receptor.

Another effect of hyperthyroidism is bone loss from osteoporosis, caused by an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. Thyrotoxicosis can also augment calcium levels in the blood by as much as 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18637 |title=Thyroid Disease, Osteoporosis and Calcium - Womens Health and Medical Information on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref>

==Management==
Treatment of Graves' disease includes [[antithyroid agents|antithyroid drugs]] which reduce the production of [[thyroid hormone]]; [[radioiodine]] (radioactive iodine [[I-131]]); and [[thyroidectomy]] (surgical excision of the gland). As operating on a frankly hyperthyroid patient is dangerous, prior to thyroidectomy preoperative treatment with antithyroid drugs is given to render the patient "euthyroid" (''i.e.'' normothyroid).

Treatment with antithyroid medications must be given for six months to two years to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in Europe, Japan, and most of the rest of the world.

[[beta blocker|β-blockers]] (such as [[propranolol]]) may be used to inhibit the [[sympathetic nervous system]]symptoms of [[tachycardia]] and nausea until such time as antithyroid treatments start to take effect. Pure beta blockers do not inhibit lid-retraction in the eyes, which is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors.

===Antithyroid drugs===
The main antithyroid drugs are [[carbimazole]] (in the UK), [[methimazole]] (in the US), and [[propylthiouracil]]/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side-effect is [[agranulocytosis]] (1/250, more in PTU). Others include [[neutropenia|granulocytopenia]] (dose dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and [[aplastic anemia]]. Patients on these medications should see a doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the [[placenta]] and are secreted in breast milk. Lygole is used to block hormone synthesis before surgery.

A [[randomized control trial]] testing single dose treatment for Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15&nbsp;mg vs 19.4% in the propylthiouracil 150&nbsp;mg groups).<ref name="pmid11298092">{{cite journal |author=Homsanit M, Sriussadaporn S, Vannasaeng S, Peerapatdit T, Nitiyanant W, Vichayanrat A |title=Efficacy of single daily dosage of methimazole vs. propylthiouracil in the induction of euthyroidism |journal=Clin.

A study has shown no difference in outcome for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal. However two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence. These two markers are a positive [[Thyrotropin receptor|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone receptor]] [[antibody]] (TSHR-Ab) and smoking. A positive TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90% ([[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] 39%, [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] 98%), a negative TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78% chance of remaining in remission. Smoking was shown to have an impact independent to a positive TSHR-Ab.<ref name="pmid11331213">{{cite journal |author=Glinoer D, de Nayer P, Bex M |title=Effects of l-thyroxine administration, TSH-receptor antibodies and smoking on the risk of recurrence in Graves' hyperthyroidism treated with antithyroid drugs: a double-blind prospective randomized study |journal=Eur.

===Radioiodine===
[[Image:Basedow-vor-nach-RIT.jpg|thumb|Scan of affected thyroid before and after [[radioiodine]] therapy.]]
[[Radioiodine]] (radioactive [[iodine-131]]) was developed in the early 1940s at the [[Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center]]. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for [[radioiodine]] are: failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure that they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.  For some patients, finding the correct thyroid replacement hormone and the correct dosage may take many years and may be in itself a much more difficult task than is commonly understood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Contraindications to RAI are [[pregnancy]] (absolute), ophthalmopathy (relative; it can aggravate thyroid eye disease), solitary [[thyroid nodule|nodules]]. 

Disadvantages of this treatment are a high incidence of [[hypothyroidism]] (up to 80%) requiring eventual thyroid hormone supplementation in the form of a daily pill(s). The radio-iodine treatment acts slowly (over months to years) to destroy the thyroid gland, and Graves' disease-associated hyperthyroidism is not cured in all persons by radioiodine, but has a relapse rate that depends on the dose of radioiodine which is administered.

===Surgery===
{{Further|Thyroidectomy|}}
This modality is suitable for young patients and pregnant patients. Indications are: a large goitre (especially when compressing the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]), suspicious nodules or suspected [[cancer]] (to pathologically examine the thyroid) and patients with ophthalmopathy.

Both bilateral subtotal [[thyroidectomy]] and the Hartley-Dunhill procedure (hemithyroidectomy on one side and partial lobectomy on other side) are possible.

Advantages are immediate cure and potential removal of [[carcinoma]]. Its risks are injury of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], [[hypoparathyroidism]] (due to removal of the [[parathyroid gland]]s), [[hematoma]] (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea) and [[scarring]]. Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid).  No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected.  Radioiodine treatment may be done after surgery, to ensure that all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (''i.e.'', near the nerves to the vocal chords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be [[Synthroid]], or thyroid replacement pills to be taken for the rest of the patient's life.

Disadvantages are as follows. A scar is created across the neck just above the collar bone line. However, the scar is very thin, and can eventually recede and appear as nothing more than a crease in the neck. The patient may spend a night in hospital after the surgery, and endure the effects of total anesthesia (''i.e.'', vomiting), as well as sore throat, raspy voice, cough from having a breathing tube stuck down the windpipe during surgery.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Eye disease===
Mild cases are treated with lubricant eye drops or non steroidal antiinflammatory drops. Severe cases threatening vision (Corneal exposure or Optic Nerve compression) are treated with steroids or orbital decompression. In all cases cessation of smoking is essential. Double vision can be corrected with prism glasses and surgery (the latter only when the process has been stable for a while).

Difficulty closing eyes can be treated with lubricant gel at night, or with tape on the eyes to enable full, deep sleep.

Orbital decompression can be performed to enable bulging eyes to retreat back into the head.  Bone is removed from the skull behind the eyes, and space is made for the muscles and fatty tissue to fall back into the skull.

Eyelid surgery can be performed on upper and/or lower eyelids to reverse the effects of Graves' on the eyelids. Eyelid muscles can become tight with Graves, making it impossible to close eyes all the way.  Eyelid surgery involves an incision along the natural crease of the eyelid, and a scraping away of the muscle that holds the eyelid open. This makes the muscle weaker, which allows the eyelid to extend over the eyeball more effectively. Eyelid surgery helps reduce or eliminate dry eye symptoms.

==Prognosis==
If left untreated, more serious [[complications (medical)|complications]] could result, including [[birth defect]]s in pregnancy, increased risk of a [[miscarriage]], and in extreme cases, death. Graves disease is often accompanied by an increase in heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead to stroke. If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur with a risk of a secondary corneal infection which could lead to blindness. Pressure on the optic nerve behind the globe can lead to visual field defects and vision loss as well.

==Epidemiology==
The disease occurs most frequently in women (7:1 compared to men). It occurs most often in middle age (most commonly in the third to fifth decades of life), but is not uncommon in adolescents, during pregnancy, during [[menopause]], or in people over age 50. There is a marked family preponderance, which has led to speculation that there may be a genetic component. To date, no clear genetic defect has been found that would point at a [[Monogenic (genetics)|monogenic]] cause.
