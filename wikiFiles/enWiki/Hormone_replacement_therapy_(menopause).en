'''Hormone replacement therapy''' ('''HRT''') is a system of medical treatment for surgically menopausal, perimenopausal and [[menopause|postmenopausal]] women and transgender women. It is based on the idea that the treatment may prevent discomfort caused by diminished circulating [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] [[hormone]]s, and in the case of the surgically or prematurely menopausal, that it may prolong life and may reduce incidence of dementia.<ref name = Maturitas>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.08.003}}</ref> It involves the use of one or more of a group of medications designed to artificially boost hormone levels. The main types of hormones involved are estrogens, [[progesterone]] or [[progestin]]s, and less commonly, [[testosterone]]. It is often referred to as "treatment" rather than therapy.

Attitudes towards HRT changed in 2002 following the announcement by the [[Women's Health Initiative]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] that those receiving the treatment ([[Prempro]]) in the main part of their study had a slightly larger incidence of [[breast cancer]], [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s, and though they also had reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and bone fractures, the benefits did not outweigh the risks.<ref name = JAMA>{{cite journal | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/3/321 | author = Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators | title = Risks and Benefits of Estrogen Plus Progestin in Healthy Postmenopausal Women: Principal Results From the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Trial | pmid = 12117397 | journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | year = 2002 | volume = 288 | pages = 321–333 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.3.321 | issue = 3}}</ref> The WHI findings were reconfirmed in a larger national study done in the UK, known as [[The Million Women Study]].

==Health effects==
While HRT is often useful for menopausal symptoms it is not recommended for the prevention of chronic conditions per the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]].<ref name=Krea2013>{{cite journal |author=Kreatsoulas C, Anand SS |title=Menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement |journal=Pol. Arch. Med. Wewn. |volume=123 |issue=3 |pages=112–7 |year=2013 |month=March |pmid=23396275 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|22786830}}</ref> 

There have been a number of large scale cross sectional and cohort studies on the effects of hormone replacement in menopause, with the largest conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom and China. Demographically, the vast majority of data available is about post-menopausal American women with at least some degree of co-morbidity, and the mean participant age in most studies is over 60 years.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22786488}}</ref> In 2002 the [[Women's Health Initiative]] was published looking at the effects of hormonal replacement therapy in post-menopausal women. The study found disparate results for all cause mortality with hormone replacement, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50-59, but higher when begun after age 60. Both age groups had a slightly higher incidence of [[breast cancer]], while [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s were increased in older patients, although not significantly higher in the younger group. Progesterone is the major anabolic hormone for breast tissue, and accordingly breast cancer was not increased in patients who were on estrogen therapy alone after hysterectomy. Sole therapy with estrogen is contraindicated if the uterus is still present due to the proliferative effect of hormone on the endometrial lining. The WHI also found a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer when estrogen and progesterone were used together, and most importantly, bone fractures. Ultimately, all cause mortality was lower for HRT than a menopausal hormonal profile when therapy was begun in the 50s, but not after age 60.<ref name = JAMA>{{cite pmid|12117397}}</ref> 

Some findings of the WHI were reconfirmed in a larger national study done in the UK, known as [[The Million Women Study]], leading to a reduction in the number of post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy.<ref>{{cite pmid|19196674}}</ref> The authors of the WHI recommended that women with normal rather than surgical menopause should take the lowest feasible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time to minimize their reported risks.<ref name = JAMA/>

These recommendations have not held up with further data analysis however. Later studies released by the WHI showed that all cause mortality was not dramatically different between the groups receiving conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), those receiving estrogen and progesterone, and those not on HRT at all. Specifically, the [[relative risk]] for all-cause mortality were 1.04 ([[confidence interval]] 0.88–1.22) in the CEE-alone trial and 1.00 (CI, 0.83–1.19) in the estrogen plus progesterone trial.<ref>{{cite pmid|17405972}}</ref> Further In an analysis that pooled data from both trials, post-menopausal HRT was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (RR, 0.70; CI, 0.51–0.96) among women ages 50 to 59 yr. This would represent five fewer deaths per 1000 women per 5 yr of therapy. A robust [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] [[meta-analysis]] from 19 [[randomized clinical trial]]s reported similar data with a RR of mortality of 0.73 (CI, 0.52–0.96) in women younger than age 60.<ref>{{cite pmid|19854329}}</ref> However, MHT had minimal effect among those between 60 and 69 years of age (RR, 1.05; CI, 0.87–1.26) and was associated with a borderline significant increase in mortality in those between 70 to 79 years of age (RR, 1.14; CI, 0.94 –1.37; P for trend < 0.06).<ref>{{cite pmid|16815651}}</ref> Similarly, in the HERS trial, with participants having a mean age of 66.7 yr, MHT did not reduce in total mortality (RR, 1.08; CI, 0.84 –1.38). <ref>{{Cite pmid|9718051 }}</ref> A 2003 meta-analysis of 30 randomized trials of menopausal HRT in relation to mortality showed that it was associated with a nearly 40% reduction in mortality in trials in which participants had a mean age of less than 60 yr or were within 10 yr of menopause onset but was unrelated to mortality in the other trials.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15209595 }}</ref> The findings in the younger age groups were similar to those in the observational [[Nurses' Health Study]] (RR for mortality, 0.63; CI, 0.56 – 0.70).<ref>{{Cite pmid|9187066 }}</ref><ref name="endocrine">{{cite journal |last1= Santen |first1= RJ|last2=Utian |first2=WH |year= 2010|title=Executive Summary: Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy: An Endocrine Society Scientific Statement |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume= 95 S1–S66 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.endo-society.org/journals/scientificstatements/upload/jc-2009-2509v1.pdf |accessdate=Feb 7, 2013}}</ref>

The beneficial profile of HRT was confirmed in a consensus expert opinion published by the [[The Endocrine Society]], which stated that when taken during perimenopause, or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published, and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios.<ref name="endocrine"/> The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in the appropriate clinical scenario.

Proprietary mixtures of [[progestin]]s and [[Premarin|conjugated equine estrogens]] are a commonly prescribed form of HRT.  As the most common and longest-prescribed type of estrogen used in HRT, most studies of HRT involve CEE. More recently developed forms of drug delivery include suppositories, subdermal implants, skin patches and gels. They have more local effect, lower doses, fewer side effects and constant rather than cyclical serum hormone levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fraser IS, Mansour D |title=Delivery systems for hormone replacement therapy |journal=Expert Opin Drug Deliv |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=191–204 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16506947 |doi=10.1517/17425247.3.2.191 |url=}}</ref> 

The data published by the WHI suggested supplemental estrogen increased risk of [[Deep vein thrombosis|venous emboli]] and [[breast cancer]] but was protective against [[osteoporosis]] and [[colorectal cancer]], while the impact on cardiovascular disease was mixed.<ref>{{cite book |author=George, James L.; Colman, Robert W.; Goldhaber, Samuel Z.; Victor J.

===Menopause===

Hormone replacement therapy's goal is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estrogen and progesterone hormones in menopause. In those with premature or surgically induced menopause, a combination HRT is often recommended, as it may also prolong life and may decrease a woman's chances of developing endometrial cancers associated with unopposed estrogen therapy, as well by decreasing the incidence of dementia.<ref name =Maturitas>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.08.003}}</ref><ref name= "eden">Eden, K.J., & Wylie, K.R. (2009). Quality of sexual life and menopause. Women’s Health, 5 (4), 385-396. doi:10.2217/whe.09.24</ref> The main hormones involved are estrogen, [[progesterone]] and [[progestin]]. Some recent therapies include the use of androgens as well.<ref name= "ziaei">Ziaei, S., Moghasemi, M., & Faghihzadeh, S. (2010). Comparative effects of conventional hormone replacement therapy and tibolone on climacteric symptoms and sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. Climateric, 13, 147-156. doi:10.1016/j.maturitas.2006.04.014 </ref>

Data from numerous studies have consistently found that HRT leads to improvements in several aspects of menopausal symptomology, including aspects of sexual dysfunction.<ref name="ziaei" /> Sexuality is a critical aspect of quality of life for the large majority of menopausal women; therefore, any features of the menopausal transition that can negatively affect a woman’s sexuality have the ability to significantly alter her quality of life. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions liked to menopause include lack of desire and low libido, both of which can be explained by changes in hormonal physiology.<ref name= "eden"/> 

Improvements in sexual pain, [[vaginal lubrication]] and [[orgasm]] are found to be statistically different from those using HRT.<ref name= "eden" /> Estrogens have positive effects of mood, sexual function, target end organs, and cognitive function. It has also been shown to prevent amyloid plaque formation, oxiadative stress, or deterioration of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system, all of which contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease.<ref name= "miller">Miller, M.M., & Franklin, K.B.J. (1999). Theoretical basis for the benefit of postmenopausal estrogen substitution. Experimental Gerontology, 34, 587-604. doi.org/10.1016/S0531-5565(99)00032-7</ref> There are several options of HRTs for women. These can include the use of estrogens alone (ERT), a combination of estrogens with one of several progestins as HRT, or the combination of estrogens, progestins, and androgens as HRT.<ref name="miller" /> 

===Venous and arterial coagulation===
[[Image:Great_saphenous_vein_thrombosis_05091312009.jpg|thumb|left|Clot in the greater [[Great saphenous vein|saphenous vein]]; oral HRT is associated with increased risk of venous clot due to increased hepatic synthesis of [[Vitamin K]] dependent clotting factors.]]Comparisons between orally administered pill and [[transdermal patch]] suggests that when estrogens are taken orally the risks of [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration are not subject to [[first pass metabolism]], and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of [[Vitamin K]] dependent [[clotting factor]]s.<ref>{{cite pmid|20601871}}</ref> This effect refers only to patches for post menopausal hormone replacement, which contain [[17 beta estradiol]], not those used in oral contraceptive therapy, which contain [[ethinyl estradiol]]. The later is associated with an increased incidence of venous clot.<ref name="Scarabin PY, Oger E, Plu-Bureau G 2003 428–32">{{cite pmid|12927428}}</ref> The WHI also showed an increased incidence arterial disease, namely stroke, in patients who began HRT after the age of 65, although this effect was not significantly present in those who began therapy during their fifth decade.

===Cardiovascular effects===
At the time of menopause, there are predictable effects on the [[lipid profile]]. Specifically, [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] decreases, while [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], [[triglyceride]]s and [[lipoprotein a]] increase. Supplemental estrogen improves the lipid profile by reversing each of these effects. Beyond this, it improves cardiac contractility, coronary artery blood flow, metabolism of carbohydrates, and decreases platelet aggregation and plaque formation.

The impact of hormone replacement on cardiovascular morbidity is a subject of much controversy in the medical literature. The reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), reported in observational studies, has not been subsequently confirmed in randomized clinical trials.  The increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the WHI was not statistically significant, and only found in the oldest women, and those who started HRT late after menopause began.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19430340 }}</ref>  The increase in risks of [[coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] in the treatment arm of the study varied according to age and years since onset of menopause. Women aged 50 to 59 using HRT showed a trend towards lower risk of coronary heart disease,<ref name=Anderson04>{{cite pmid|15082697}}</ref> as did women who were within five years of the onset of menopause.<ref>{{cite pmid|12904517}}</ref>

The adverse cardiovascular outcomes may only apply to oral dosing with the progestin and equine estrogens in oral systemic therapy, while [[topical]] [[estradiol]] and [[estriol]] may not produce the same risks, due to the absence of anabolic effects of hepatic vitamin K dependent clotting factors.<ref name="Scarabin PY, Oger E, Plu-Bureau G 2003 428–32"/>

Another recent [[randomized controlled trial]] found HRT may reduces development of [[heart disease]] and reduce the incidence of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in women between 50 and 59, although not in women past the age of 60. The mechanism may have something to do with the contradictory effects of increasing propensity for clotting, versus positive effect on the [[lipid profile]]. Follow-up studies are being performed which are intended to confirm these findings. The increased risk of breast cancer remains.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5204360 | title=Hormones May Help Younger Women's Hearts | author=Patti Neighmond | date=2006-02-13 | publisher= All Things Considered}}</ref>

===Endometrial effects===
[[Image:Endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Endometrial tumor on histology. Most commonly, the tumor is ''in situ'' with minimal morbidity; patients still have lower all-cause [[mortality rate|mortality]] than those not on HRT.]] While combined estrogen-progesterone supplementation has been linked to an increased incidence of endometrial cancer, the specific subtype is usually stage I, or ''in situ'', and has extremely low morbidity and mortality, and studies in American women have shown the tumor to not have propensity for growth into the myometrium or parametrial soft tissues. When seen in the context of all cause mortality, women who take estrogen and develop endometrial cancer have high survival rates than women who do not take hormonal therapy at all, which was due to the preventive effect of HRT on hip fractures.

Unopposed estrogen (the supplementation of [[Endogeny|endogenous]] estrogens without a [[progestogen]]) can also result in [[endometrial hyperplasia]], a precursor to [[endometrial cancer]].  The extensive use of high-dose estrogens for [[birth control]] in the 1970s is thought to have resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of this type of cancer.<ref>{{cite book |author=Young, Robert; Arlan F., Jr Fuller; Fuller, Arlan F.; Michael V. Seiden |title=Uterine cancer |publisher=B.C. Decker |location=Hamilton, Ont |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-55009-163-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Musculoskeletal effects===
HRT is effective at reversing the effects of aging on muscle<ref>{{cite pmid|19382224}}</ref> and promoting [[reverse cholesterol transport]] (RCT) via the induction of [[cholesterol]] [[ABC transporters]].<ref name="pmid20807164">{{cite pmid|20807164}}</ref>

===Neurological effects===
According to a 2007 presentation at an [[American Academy of Neurology]] meeting,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18440238  | title=Hormones may ward off dementia in women: Controversial treatment effective when taken soon after menopause| publisher=Associated Press | author=Jeff Donn | date = 2007-05-02}}</ref> hormone therapy taken soon after menopause may help protect against dementia, but it raises the risk of mental decline in women who do not take hormone replacement until they are older. Dementia risk was 1% in women who started HRT early, and 1.7% in women who didn't, (i.e. women who didn't take hormone replacement seem to have had&mdash;on average&mdash;a 70% higher [[relative risk]] of dementia than women who began HRT around the time of the beginning of menopause). This suggests that there may be a "critical period" during which time taking HRT may have benefits, but if HRT is initiated after that period, it will not have such benefits and may cause harm. This is consistent with research that hormone therapy improves executive and attention processes in postmenopausal women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = R | last2 = Fazekas | first2 = F | last3 = Reinhart | first3 = B | last4 = Kapeller | first4 = P | last5 = Fazekas | first5 = G | last6 = Offenbacher | first6 = H | last7 = Eber | first7 = B | last8 = Schumacher | first8 = M | last9 = Freidl | first9 = W.

===Breast tissue effects===
[[Image:Mammo breast cancer.jpg|thumb|left|The WHI found breast cancer increased in post-menopausal women taking combined estrogen-progesterone therapy, but not in post-hysterectomy patients on estrogen therapy alone.]] The relative risk (RR) of breast cancer varies from 1.24 in the WHI study to 1.66 in the Million Women Study, with results differing according to interval between menopause and hormone therapy and methods of hormone replacement.<ref>{{Cite pmid|23062839}}</ref> The WHI preliminary results in 2004 found a non-significant trend in the estrogen-alone clinical trial towards a reduced risk of breast cancer<ref name=Anderson04 /> and a 2006 update concluded that use of estrogen-only HRT for 7 years does not increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have had a [[hysterectomy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stefanick ML, Anderson GL, Margolis KL, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of conjugated equine estrogens on breast cancer and mammography screening in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=14 |pages=1647–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16609086 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.14.1647}}</ref> The results of the WHI estrogen-alone trial suggest that the progestin used in the WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial increased the risk for breast cancer above that associated with estrogen alone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hulley SB, Grady D |title=The WHI estrogen-alone trial--do things look any better? |journal=JAMA |volume=291 |issue=14 |pages=1769–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15082705 |doi=10.1001/jama.291.14.1769}}</ref>

A recent randomized controlled trial recently showed that increased breast cancer risk applied only to those women who take progesterone analogues, but not to those taking bio-identical progesterone itself, nor to hysterectomized women who take unopposed estrogen.<ref>{{cite pmid|17333341}}</ref>

Some reports have not found an association of progesterone therapy and breast cancer. The absence of effect in these studies has been suggested to be due to selective prescription to overweight women, or to the very low progesterone serum levels after oral administration leading to a strong tumor inactivation rate.<ref>{{Cite pmid|23336704}}</ref>

===Hip fractures===
[[File:Femoral neck fracture, right hip.jpg|thumb|right|Hip fractures were decreased in patients on HRT, causing a significant reduction in all cause mortality.]]Estrogen prevents the activity of [[osteoclasts]], and improves [[bone mineral density]]. Hip fracture is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older females, and usually does not occur in the setting of [[osteoporosis]]. Estrogen is the only medical therapy that has been shown to prevent hip fractures in women that are not osteoporotic, with efficacy superior to [[bisphosphonates]] or [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplementation.

==Premature stoppage of Women's Health Initiative==
Clinical medical practice changed with two parallel [[Women's Health Initiative|WHI]] studies of postmenopausal HRT. Prior studies were smaller, and many were of women who electively took hormonal therapy. The WHI studies were the first large, [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind]], placebo-controlled clinical trials of HRT in healthy, postmenopausal women.

The WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial was stopped prematurely in 2002 because preliminary results suggested risks of combined conjugated equine estrogen and progestin exceeded their benefits. The estrogen-alone trial, performed on women who were post [[hysterectomy]], due to the proliferative effect of the hormone on endometrial tissue, did not show such problems and was continued. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in estrogen only arm, risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.<ref>{{cite news | title=New WHI Estrogen Analysis Shows Lower Breast Ca Risk| publisher=MedPageToday | author=John Gever| date=2011-04-05| url= http://www.medpagetoday.com/OBGYN/HRT/25734}}</ref>

The first report on the halted WHI estrogen-plus-progestin study came out in July 2002.<ref>{{cite pmid|12117397}}</ref> It followed over 16 000 women for an average of 5.2 years, half of whom took [[placebo]], while the other half took a combination of [[progestin]] [[Medroxyprogesterone|medroxyprogesterone acetate]] and [[Premarin|conjugated equine estrogen]]. 

The study reported [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] increases in rates of [[breast cancer]], [[coronary heart disease]], [[stroke]]s and [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]]. The study also found statistically significant decreases in rates of [[hip fracture]] and [[colorectal cancer]]. "A year after the study was stopped in 2002, an article was published indicating that estrogen plus progestin also increases the risks of dementia."<ref>[http://www.center4research.org/hrt072002.html Center4research.org]</ref> The conclusion of the study was that the HRT combination presented risks that outweighed its measured benefits. The results were almost universally reported as risks and problems associated with HRT in general, rather than with PremPro, the specific proprietary combination of conjugated equine estrogen and progestin studied.  

After the increased clotting found in the first WHI results was reported in 2002, the number of Prempro prescriptions filled reduced by almost half. An unknown number of women started taking alternatives to Prempro, such as bioidentical hormones.<ref>{{cite news| title=For a Low-Dose Hormone, Take Your Pick | publisher=New York Times| author=Roni Caryn Rabin| date = 2007-08-28| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E6D91539F93BA1575BC0A9619C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1}} 

Many women seeking natural remedies have turned to compounding pharmacies, druggists who promise so-called bioidentical hormones that are chemically synthesized but have the same molecular structure as hormones produced by a woman's body.</ref> A sharp drop in breast cancer rates was observed following these changes, and held steady in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sharp Drop in Rates of Breast Cancer Holds| publisher=New York Times| author=Gina Kolata| date=2007-04-19| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6D91E3FF93AA25757C0A9619C8B63}}</ref>

===Women's Health Initiative limitations and criticisms===
The WHI trial was limited by low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22786830}}</ref> The double blinding limited validity of study results due to its effects on patient exclusion criteria. Patients who were experiencing symptoms of menopause were excluded from the study. As a result, while the average age of menopause is at age 51, study participants were on average 62 years of age. Demographically, the vast majority were Caucasian, and tended to be slightly overweight and former smokers.

==Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy==
{{Main|Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy}}
Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy refers to the use of hormones that are chemically identical to those produced in a woman's body.  

Some bioidentical hormone therapies are FDA approved.  Others are provided in connection with the practices of pharmaceutical [[compounding]] and [[saliva testing]] to determine, and adjust a woman's hormone levels. The latter two practices are not widely accepted in clinical medicine. Compounding has not demonstrated any benefits and presents risks of uncertain dosing, potency and possible contamination. In addition, saliva testing is of limited utility due to natural fluctuations in hormone levels, and lack of consensus for ideal dosage in humans.<ref>{{cite pmid|15167316}}</ref>

Proponents also claim that BHRT can offer advantages beyond those typical of traditional HRT.  There is as yet no evidence to dispute with these claims, but also none deemed sufficient to establish them with certainty.  The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has stated that BHRT were expected to present the same risks and benefits of non-bioidentical HRT, but that traditional products have been researched to quantify these risks and benefits, and are produced by manufacturers with stringent purity and potency standards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116832.htm | title = FDA Takes Action Against Compounded Menopause Hormone Therapy Drugs | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] | date = 2008-01-09 | accessdate = 2009-02-17 }}</ref>

==HRT and sexuality==
Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity.<ref name= "eden" /> Menopause can be divided into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms.<ref name= "eden" /> It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness.<ref name= "eden" /> The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.<ref name= "sarrel"> Sarrel, P.M. (2000). Effects of hormone replacement therapy on sexual psychophysiology and behavior in postmenopause. Journal of Women’s Health and Gender-Based Medicine, 9, 25-32 </ref> 

It is commonly perceived that once women near the end of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life.<ref name="eden" /> However, especially since women today are living one third or more of their lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance.<ref name= "miller" />. A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40-69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the sexual health and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of sexual health and quality of life that is worthy of attention by health care professionals.<ref name= "eden" /> A major complaint among postmenopoausal women is decreased libido, and many may seek medical consultation for this.<ref name= "ziaei"> Ziaei, S., Moghasemi, M., & Faghihzadeh, S. (2010). Comparative effects of conventional hormone replacement therapy and tibolone on climacteric symptoms and sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. Climateric, 13, 147-156. doi:10.1016/j.maturitas.2006.04.014 </ref> Several hormonal changes take place during the menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone. For most women, the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages.<ref name= "eden" /> Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the postmenopausal period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition.<ref name= "eden" />. However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.<ref name= "eden" />

In menopausal women, sexual functioning can impact several dimensions of a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being.<ref name= "gonzalez"> Gonzalez, M., Viagara, G., Caba, F., & Molina, E. (2004). Sexual function, menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The European Menopause Journal, 48, 411-420. doi:10.1016/j.maturitas.2003.10.005 </ref> During the onset of menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual response cycle.<ref name="nappi"> Nappi, R.E. et al., (2006). Clitoral stimulation in postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction: A pilot randomized study with hormone therapy. European Menopause Journal, 55, 288-295</ref> Both age- and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies.<ref name="nappi" /> Therefore, it can be appropriate to make use of HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.<ref name="ziaei" /> 

Current research that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances in two of the domains.<ref name= "gonzalez" /> Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged they were more likely to report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT.<ref name= "gonzalez" /> Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT.<ref name= "gonzalez" /> Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction- the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%.<ref name= "gonzalez" /> This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.<ref name= "gonzalez"/>

The maintenance and improvement of quality of life during the menopausal period is at the core of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy.<ref name= "ziaei" /> Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties<ref name= "sarrel" />. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT.<ref name="sarrel" /> It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity.<ref name= "sarrel" /> Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted.<ref name="sarrel" /> However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use.<ref name= "sarrel" /> A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone.<ref name= "sarrel" /> Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone- a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties- suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed.<ref name= "ziaei" /> However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.<ref name= "ziaei" />

===Effects on sexuality in transsexuals===
Cross-sex hormone treatment is an integral component in the medical treatment of transsexuals, as the hormones can lead to decreasing the dichotomy between an individual's body and their [[gender identity]].<ref name= "moore" > Moore, E., Wisniewski, & Dobs, A. (2003). Endocrine treatment of transsexual people: A review of treatment regimens, outcomes, and adverse effects. The Journal of Endocrinology & Metabolism, 88(9), 3467-3473. Doi: 10.1210/jc.2002-021967</ref> Managing long-term hormonal regimens have not been studied and are difficult to estimate because research on the long-term use of hormonal therapy has not been noted.<ref name= "moore" /> However, it is possible to speculate the outcomes of these therapies on transsexual people based on the knowledge of the current effects of gonadal hormones on sexual functioning in natural men and women.<ref name= "klein"> Klein, C., & Gorzalka, B.B. (2009). Sexual functioning in transsexuals following hormone therapy and genital surgery: A review. Journal of Sexual Medicine, 6(11), 2922-2939. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01370.x </ref> 

Firstly, if one is to decrease testosterone in MtF transsexuals, it is likely that sexual desire and arousal would be inhibited; alternatively, if high doses of estrogen negatively impact sexual desire, which has been found in some research with natal women, it is hypothesized that combining androgens with high levels of estrogen would intensify this outcome.<ref name= "klein" /> Unfortunately, to date there haven’t been any randomized clinical trials looking at the relationship between type and dose of cross-sex hormone therapy, so the relationship between them remains unclear.<ref name= "klein" /> Typically, the estrogens given to MtF transsexuals were 2-3 times higher than the recommended dose for HRT in postmenopausal women.<ref name= "moore" /> While pharmokinetic studies indicate that by taking these increased doses it may lead to a higher boost in plasma estradiol levels; however, since the long-term side effects haven’t been studied, the safety of this route is unclear.<ref name= "moore" /> 

As with any pharmacological or hormone treatment, there are potential side effects, which in the case of hormone therapy include changes in sexual functioning. These have the ability to significantly impact sexual functioning, either directly or indirectly through the various side effects, such as cerebrovascular disorders, obesity, and mood fluctuations.<ref name= "klein" /> In addition, some research has found an onset of diabetes following feminizing hormone therapy, which impairs sexual response. Whatever route an individual and his or her doctor choose to take, it is important to consider both the medical risks of hormone therapy as well as the psychological needs of the patient.

==History==
The first clinical usage of hormone replacement therapy in the setting of menopause began in the 1950s, with the administered [[estrogen]] purified from the urine of pregnant [[mares]]. From that time until 1975, estrogen was administered without supplemental progesterone or progestin. A study from [[Kaiser Permanente]] by Dr. Harry Ziel demonstrated that in the absence of progesterone, patients were at increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen therapy. After this, progestin was supplemented in women who had not received surgical[[hysterectomy]], to reduce the incidence of [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer|cancer]]. This was followed by the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002. However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined Estrogen and Progesterone therapy was closed prematurely by its [[Data Monitoring Committee]] (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.

==Administration and formulations==
HRT is available in various forms. It generally provides low dosages of one or more estrogens, and often also provides either progesterone or a chemical analogue, called a progestin. Testosterone may also be included. In women who have had a [[hysterectomy]], an estrogen is usually given without any progesterone, a therapy referred to as "unopposed estrogen therapy". HRT may be delivered to the body via patches, tablets, creams, troches, [[intrauterine device|IUD]]s, [[vaginal ring]]s, gels or, more rarely, by injection. For example, [[vaginally administered estrogens]] include those given by intravaginal tablets, creams and rings, and can have more effect on [[atrophic vaginitis]] with fewer systemic effects than estrogens delivered by other means.<ref name=mayo2011>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR602127 Estrogen (Vaginal Route)] from Mayo Clinic / Thomson Healthcare Inc. Portions of this document last updated: Nov. 1, 2011</ref>

Dosage is often varied cyclically to more closely mimic the ovarian hormone cycle, with estrogens taken daily and progesterone or progestins taken for about two weeks every month or two; a method called "cyclic HRT" or "sequentially combined HRT" (abbreviated scHRT). An alternate method, a constant dosage with both types of hormones taken daily, is called "continuous combined HRT" or ccHRT, and is a more recent innovation. Sometimes an [[androgen]], generally testosterone, is added to treat diminished [[libido]]. It may also treat reduced energy and help reduce osteoporosis after menopause.   

HRT is often given as a short-term relief (often one or two years, usually less than five) from menopausal symptoms ([[hot flushes]], irregular menstruation, fat redistribution, etc.). Younger women with [[premature ovarian failure]] or [[oophorectomy|surgical menopause]] may use hormone replacement therapy for many years, until the age that natural menopause would be expected to occur.

Formulations of estradiol include:
*{{anchor|estradiol tablet}}Oral tablets, commonly given in amounts of 1 to 2 milligrams of estradiol per day.
*[[Estrogen patch]]es
*{{anchor|estradiol gel}}Estrogen [[transdermal gel]]s

{{anchor|estrogen+progestin}}
In addition, there are many formulations of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as [[norethisterone]] (in ''Activelle''), [[levonorgestrel]], [[medroxyprogesterone]], [[dienogest]] or [[drospirenone]].
