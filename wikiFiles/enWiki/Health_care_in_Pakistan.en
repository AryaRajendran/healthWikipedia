'''Healthcare''' in [[Pakistan]] is administered mainly in the private sector which accounts for approximately 80% of all outpatient visits. The public sector was until recently led by the [[Ministry of Health (Pakistan)|Ministry of Health]], however the Ministry was abolished in June 2011 and all health responsibilities (mainly planning and fund allocation) were devolved to provincial Health Departments which had until now been the main implementers of public sector health programs. Like other [[South Asia]]n countries, health and sanitation infrastructure is adequate in urban areas but is generally poor in rural areas. About 19% of the population and 30% of children under age of five are malnourished.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Ministry of Health (Pakistan)|Ministry of Health]] of Pakistan states that health expenditure of period 2007-08 was 3.791 billion [[Pakistani rupee]]s while that spent on development was 14.272 billion.<ref name="ministry_statistics"/>

==Health concerns==

===Infectious diseases===
[[File:Pakistan infectious diseases 2006.jpg|thumb|Infectious diseases in Pakistan by proportion (2006)]]

====Priority diseases====
Most common and lethal diseases in Pakistan include:

*[[Acute respiratory infection]] (51%): Among the victims of ARI, most vulnerable are children whose immune systems have been weakened by malnutrition. In 1990, ''National ARI Control Programme'' was started in order to reduce the mortality concerned with [[pneumonia]] and other respiratory diseases. In following three years, death rates among victims under age of five in [[Islamabad]] had been reduced to half.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/inf-new/child2.htm|title=Pakistan acts to reduce child deaths from pneumonia |work=who.int |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO), International |accessdate=August 1, 1982}}</ref> In 2006, there were 16,056,000 reported cases of ARI, out of which 25.6% were children under age of five.<ref name="ministry_disease_statistics"/>
*[[Viral hepatitis]] (7.5%): Viral Hepatitis, particularly that caused by types B and C are major epidemics in Pakistan with nearly 12 million individuals infected with either of the virus. The main cause remains massive overuse of therapeutic injections and reuse of syringes during these injections in the private sector healthcare.
*[[Malaria]] (16%): It is a problem faced by the lower-class people in Pakistan. The unsanitary conditions and stagnant water bodies in the rural areas and city slums provide excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Use of nets and mosquito repellents is becoming more common. A programme initiated by the government aims to bring down malarial incidence below 0.01% by the year 2011. In Pakistan, malarial incidence reaches its peak in September.<ref name="ministry_malaria">{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Moh/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3h_Nx9_SzcPIwMDs2BTAyMfN08TXyd_4xAXY_1wkA6zeAMcwNEAIh_q5hXg7O5sZGBhDjLB1dPP2MTQ19DA0ETfzyM_N1W_IDs7zdFRUREAvzd_qQ!!/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfT0ZMTzlGSDIwT1Y4MDAyVEo3RUZUSzIwNzA!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MohCL/ministry/home/sahomegeneral/sageneralright/national+malaria+control+programme |title=National Malaria Control Programme |publisher=Ministry of Health, Pakistan|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref> In 2006, there were around 4,390,000 new reported cases of fever.<ref name="ministry_disease_statistics"/>
*[[Diarrhea]] (15%): There were around 4,500,000 reported cases in 2006, 14% of which were children under the age of five.<ref name="ministry_disease_statistics"/>
*[[Dysentery]] (8%) and [[Scabies]] (7%)
*Others: [[goitre]], [[hepatitis]] and [[tuberculosis]]

====Controllable diseases====
* [[Cholera]]: As of 2006, there were a total of 4,610 cases of suspected cholera.<ref name="ministry_disease_statistics"/> However, the floods of 2010 suggested that cholera transmission may be more prevalent than previously understood. Furthermore, research from the Aga Khan University suggests that cholera may account for a quarter of all childhood diarrhea in some parts of rural Sindh.
* [[Dengue fever]]: An outbreak of dengue fever occurred in October 2006 in Pakistan. Several deaths occurred due to misdiagnosis, late treatment and lack of awareness in the local population. But overall, steps were taken to kill vectors for the fever and the disease was controlled later, with minimal casualties.
* [[Measles]]: As of 2008, there were a total of 441 reported cases of measles in Pakistan.<ref name="who_statistics"/>
* [[Meningococcal meningitis]]: As of 2006, there were a total of 724 suspected cases of Meningococcal meningitis.<ref name="ministry_disease_statistics"/>

====Poliomyelitis====
{{main|Poliomyelitis in Pakistan}}
Pakistan is one of the few countries in which [[poliomyelitis]] has not been eradicated. As of 2008, there were a total of 89 reported cases of polio in Pakistan.<ref name="who_statistics"/> Polio cases may be on an increase. The year 2010 saw an increase in the number of cases as well identification of polio from new locations. Experts from the national program and the WHO felt that the new cases identified from southern Punjab and northern Sindh may have resulted from importation of infections from other locations in Pakistan. Locations in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain hosts for year round persistence of infection and environmental sampling by the national program and WHO suggests that polio remains endemic in many other parts of the country.

====HIV/AIDS====
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Pakistan}}
The AIDS epidemic is well established and may even be expanding Pakistan. Risk factors are high rates of commercial sex and non-marital sex,<ref>Migrant men: a priority for HIV control in Pakistan?

New government in Pakistan faces old challenges. Lancet Infect Dis. 2008;8:217-218 and Shah, SA. Tropical Medicine Symposium, The Aga Khan University and the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine, 2008.</ref>

===Family planning===
{{main|Family planning in Pakistan}}
"The government of Pakistan wants to stabilize the population (achieve zero [[Population growth rate|growth rate]]) by 2020. And maximizing the usage of family planning methods is one of the pillars of the population program".<ref>http://www.mopw.gov.pk/event3.html Population Policy of Government of Pakistan</ref> The latest Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) conducted by Macro International with partnership of National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) registered family planning usage in Pakistan to be 30 percent. While this shows an overall increase from 12 percent in 1990-91 (PDHS 1990-91), 8% of these are users of traditional methods. Approximately 7 million women use any form of family planning and the number of urban family planning users have remained nearly static between 1990 and 2007. Since a many of contraception users are sterilized (38%), the actual number of women accessing any family planning services in a given year are closer to 3 million with over half buying either condoms or pills from stores directly. Government programs by either the Health or Population ministries together combine to reach less than 1 million users annually.<ref>http://resdev.org/Docs/01fpoverview.pdf Overview of Family Planning in Pakistan</ref> Thus, fertility remains high, at 4.1 births per woman. Owing to such high fertility levels, Pakistan's overall population growth rate is much higher than elsewhere in South Asia (1.9 percent per year).  

Some of the main factors that account for this lack of progress with Family Planning include inadequate programs that don't meet the needs of women who desire family planning or counsel users of family planning about potential side effects, a lack of effective campaign to convince women and their families about the value of smaller families and the overall social mores of a society where women seldom control decisions about their own fertility or families. However the single most important factor that has confounded efforts to promote family planning in Pakistan is the lack of consistent supply of commodities and services.<ref>http://resdev.org/Docs/01fpservices.pdf Family Planning Services in Pakistan</ref> Indeed, the unmet need for contraception has remained high at around 25% of all married women of reproductive age (higher than the proportion that are using a modern contraceptive and twice as high as the number of women being served with family planning services in any given year<ref>http://resdev.org/Docs/06umn.pdf What unmet need for family planning means in Pakistan</ref>) and historically any attempt to supply commodities has been met with extremely rapid rise (over 10% per annum) in contraception users compared with the 0.5% increase in national CPR over the past 50 years.

Currently the government contributes about a third of all FP services and the private sector including NGOs the rest. Within the private sector, franchised clinics offer higher quality health care than unfranchised clinics but there is no discernible difference between costs per client and proportion of poorest clients across franchised and unfranchised private clinics.<ref name="Comparing Private Sector">{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Nirali|coauthors=et al|title=Comparing Private Sector Family Planning Services To Government And NGO Services In Ethiopia And Pakistan: How Do Social Franchises Compare Across Quality, Equity And Cost?|journal=Health Policy Plan|year=2011|volume=26|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i63 - i71|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/comparing-private-sector-family-planning-services-to-governm.html|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>   Government programs are run by both the Ministries of Populaition Welfare and Health. The most common method used is female sterilization which accounts for over a third of all modern method users. Unfortunately this happens too late for most women as sterilized women are over 30 years of age and have 4 or more children. Condoms are the next most popular method.

===Maternal and child health===
In June 2011, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] released a report on [http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html The State of the World's Midwifery]. It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Pakistan is 260.  This is compared with 376.5 in 2008 and 541.2 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 89 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 48. The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the [[Millennium Development Goals]] can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal death. In Pakistan the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 10 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 93.<ref name="SOWMY">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|date=Accessed August 2011}}</ref>

There is a huge imbalance in these figures. In Balochistan, for instance, the maternal mortality is 785 deaths per 100,000 live births which is nearly triple the national rate. It should be noted here that in rural Pakistan, maternal mortality is nearly twice than that in cities. The sad reality is that 80 per cent of maternal deaths are preventable.<ref>http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pub_details.cfm?ID=783&srchTp=advanced Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2006-07</ref>

According to official data, there are 127,859 doctors and 12,804 health facilities in the country to cater for over 170 million people.<ref>http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/healthcare-in-pakistan-too-expensive-to-afford</ref> 

Many Pakistani doctors and medical professionals choose to migrate to other countries, contributing to a [[brain drain]] and chronic skills shortage in the country. In the United States alone, there are over 17,000 doctors of Pakistani origin.<ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/303012/us-should-appologise-to-pakistan-nato-pay-reparations-to-soldiers-congressman-kucinich/ US should apologise to Pakistan, NATO pay reparations to soldiers: Congressman Kucinich]</ref> Pakistan is the fourth highest source of [[International medical graduate]] doctors in the U.S<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/international-medical-graduates/imgs-in-united-states/imgs-country-origin.shtml IMGs by Country of Origin]</ref> as well as the fourth highest source of foreign dentists licensed in the United States.<ref>[http://jada.ada.org/content/138/2/219.full Foreign-trained dentists licensed in the United States] Retrieved 08-07-2011</ref>

===Dentistry===
{{Main|Dentistry in Pakistan}}
At present there are upwards of 70 dental schools (public and private) throughout Pakistan, according to the [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] the state regulatory body has upwards of 11500 registered dentists. The four year training culminates in achieving a ''Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS)'' degree, which requires a further one year compulsory internship to be a registered dentist in Pakistan.

===Community medicine===
Pakistan is committed to the goal of making its population healthier, as evidenced by the continuing strong support for the Social Action Program (SAP) and by the new vision for health, nutrition, and population outlined in the National Health Policy Guidelines published by the government. 

*'''Lady health workers''': A recent initiative, lady health worker, has turned out to be a promising [[community health worker|community-based health worker]] program. These workers bring health information, some basic health care and family planning services to doorsteps of women. Presently, 96,000 women are serving as in this initiative in their home villages.<ref name="Ministry of Health Pakistan: Overview of the LHW Program">[http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Moh/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNDE_1wkA6zeAMcwNEAIo_HBDR5Nw9zAyNDV6eggFBDY6ByfT-P_NxU_Uj9KPN4fzcff0s3DyOQwUBTXCwNDX0MfI0tA431I3NS0xOTK_ULsrODLLwdFQHtLsMY/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfT0ZMTzlGSDIwT1Y4MDAyVEo3RUZUSzIwNzA!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MohCL/ministry/home/sahomegeneral/sageneralleft/a_national+programme+for+family+planning++primary+health+care/] National Programme for Family Planning & Primary Health Care(LHW Programme, MOH Pakistan

*'''Telemedicine''': Over the last five years, [[telemedicine]] efforts have been attempted to connect rural population to doctors in the city. However, there has been limited success. A new initiative has begun in Karachi to connect hospitals and doctors to patients over the internet. Mediconnect, an organization aimed to develop community medicine in Pakistan, is creating a centralized database of all healthcare facilities in Pakistan with impartial ratings systems and instant online appointment bookings.<ref>[http://www.mediconnect.pk MediConnect]</ref>
