{{Reading}}
A '''reading disability''' is a condition in which a sufferer displays difficulty reading resulting primarily from neurological factors. [[Dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]], [[Alexia (acquired dyslexia)]], and [[Hyperlexia]].

==Definition==
[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] defines reading disability or dyslexia as follows: "Dyslexia is a brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding. In adults, dyslexia usually occurs after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia." <ref>{{NINDS|dyslexia}}</ref>

===Dyslexia===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}
Dyslexia is a [[learning disability]] that manifests itself as a difficulty with word decoding, reading comprehension and/or reading fluency. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate [[reading instruction]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stanovich KE |title=Explaining the differences between the dyslexic and the garden-variety poor reader: the phonological-core variable-difference model |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=590–604 |year=1988 |month=December |pmid=2465364 |doi=10.1177/002221948802101003 }}</ref> It is estimated that dyslexia affects between 5–17% of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCandliss BD, Noble KG |title=The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=196–204 |year=2003 |pmid=12953299 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10080 |url=}}</ref><ref name=Czepita2006 >{{cite journal |author=Czepita D, Lodygowska E |title=[Role of the organ of vision in the course of developmental dyslexia] |language=Polish |journal=Klin Oczna |volume=108 |issue=1–3 |pages=110–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16883955 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="Birsh2005">{{cite book |last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Research and reading disability |editor=Judith R.
