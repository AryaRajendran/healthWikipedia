[[Image:Main symptoms of Caffeine overdose.png|thumb|left|200px|]]

Caffeine toxicity can present as a spectrum of clinical symptoms. Most of these originate in the central nervous and circulatory systems and can follow ingestion of 1g or more of caffeine. Insomnia, breathlessness and excitement progressing to mild delirium may be seen. Sensory disturbances, [[Polyuria|diuresis]], [[tachycardia]], extrasystoles, and elevated respirations as well as vomiting induced by potent gastric irritation can be present. Fatalities of caffeine poisoning are rare because the gastric irritation and vomiting develop before absorption of toxic amounts can occur. Normally, caffeine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with distribution in various tissues in approximate proportion to their water content. Convulsions result from the central stimulating effect with death caused by respiratory failure. [[Hyperglycemia]] and [[ketonuria]] associated with caffeine toxicity have been reported. These latter findings may be attributed to a stress reaction or the xanthine’s ability to mimic the metabolic effects of the cathecholamines including lipolysis, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.<ref name="ld50">{{cite journal |pmid=6056149 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=1967 |last1=Peters |first1=JM |last2=Boyd |first2=EM |title=The influence of a cachexigenic diet on caffeine toxicity |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=121–7 |journal=Toxicology and applied pharmacology |doi=10.1016/0041-008X(67)90033-6}}</ref> An acute overdose of caffeine usually in excess of about 300 milligrams, dependent on body weight and level of caffeine tolerance, can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called ''caffeine intoxication'',<ref name="DSM-IV">{{cite web |work=[[DSM-IV]] |url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=22&sectionid=1889660 |title=305.90 Caffeine Intoxication}}</ref> or colloquially the "caffeine jitters".

==Effects on different functions==
===Relationship between caffeine and adenosine===
The predominate mechanism of action of caffeine is the antagonism of [[adenosine]] receptors. Adenosine is a locally released purine hormone that acts on different receptors (A1 and A2) that can increase or decrease cellular concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Adenosine inhibits adenyl cyclise via high affinity (A1) receptors and stimulates adenyl cyclise via low affinity (A2) receptors. Adenosine receptors are found throughout the body including the brain, in the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and gastrointestinal system and in adipose tissue. Caffeine nonselectively blocks both adenosine receptors and competitively inhibits the actions of adenosine. Adenosine acts presynaptically to inhibit neuronal release of acetylcholine, [[norepinephrine]], dopamine, gamma amino butyric acid and serotonin. Adenosine also reduces spontaneous firing of neurons in many regions of the brain which produces sedation and has anticonvulsant activity. Caffeine releases norepinephrine, dopamine and [[serotonin]] in the brain and increases circulating catecholamines consistent with reversal of the inhibitory effects of adenosine on these systems.<ref name="Benowitz1990">{{cite journal |pmid=2184730 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=1990 |last1=Benowitz |first1=NL |title=Clinical pharmacology of caffeine |volume=41 |pages=277–88 |doi=10.1146/annurev.me.41.020190.001425 |journal=Annual review of medicine}}</ref>

==Short-term effects==

===Cardiovascular===
Caffeine increases cardiac arrhythmia (improper heart rate) by increasing stress hormone (e.g.adrenaline) secretions.<ref name="Bracco">{{cite journal |pmid=7485480 |url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=7485480 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |title=Effects of caffeine on energy metabolism, heart rate, and methylxanthine metabolism in lean and obese women |year=1995 |author1=D.

Different people have different tolerance for caffeine based on individual metabolic activity, so there is no clear distinction between caffeine consumption and the amount heart rate increases.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

===Gastrointestinal distress===
Caffeine can stimulate the secretion of stress hormones (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine), which can increase blood pressure. Moreover, stress hormones activate the body's "fight or flight" reactions, causing the body to redirect blood supply from the digestive system to muscles.  In this way, decreased blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract will slow down the absorption rate and lead to indigestion.<ref name="Boekema1999">{{cite journal |pmid=10499460 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=1999 |last1=Boekema |first1=PJ |last2=Samsom |first2=M |last3=Van Berge Henegouwen |first3=GP |last4=Smout |first4=AJ |title=Coffee and gastrointestinal function: Facts and fiction.

Moreover, the additional epinephrine increases the secretion of the main gastric hormone gastrin, which will speed up gastric peristalsis and hypersecretion of gastric juice.<ref name="Cohen1975">{{cite journal |pmid=1177987 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=1975 |last1=Cohen |first1=S |last2=Booth |first2=GH |title=Gastric acid secretion and lower-esophageal-sphincter pressure in response to coffee and caffeine |volume=293 |issue=18 |pages=897–9 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197510302931803 |journal=The New England journal of medicine}}</ref><ref name="Sherwood2004">{{cite book |last1=Sherwood |first1=Lauralee |last2=Kell |first2=Robert |title=Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems |edition=1st Canadian |year=2009 |publisher=Nelsen |isbn=0-17-644107-7 |pages=613–9}}</ref> Additional gastric acid will lead to acidic chyme going into the small intestine and cause intestinal injury.<ref name="Boekema1999"/> Therefore, it is not recommended for ulcer patients to drink too much coffee.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

===Increased urination===
Caffeine intake increases renal excretion of sodium and water. This is caused by both slightly increasing the glomerular filteration rate and inhibiting the tubular reabsorption of sodium and water.{{fact|date=March 2013}}
Although the ability for caffeine and theophylline to induce diuresis and natriuresis is well established, the mechanisms behind them are not well understood.<ref name="Rieg2004">{{cite journal |pmid=15590766 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=2005 |last1=Rieg |first1=T |last2=Steigele |first2=H |last3=Schnermann |first3=J |last4=Richter |first4=K |last5=Osswald |first5=H |last6=Vallon |first6=V |title=Requirement of intact adenosine A1 receptors for the diuretic and natriuretic action of the methylxanthines theophylline and caffeine |volume=313 |issue=1 |pages=403–9 |doi=10.1124/jpet.104.080432 |journal=The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics}}</ref>

===Psychological===
The US National Institutes of Health states "''too much caffeine can make you restless, anxious, and irritable. It may also keep you from sleeping well and cause headaches, abnormal heart rhythms, or other problems. If you stop using caffeine, you could get withdrawal symptoms. Some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others. They should limit their use of caffeine. So should pregnant and nursing women.''"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/caffeine.html |title=Caffeine |publisher=MedlinePlus |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>

==Long-term effects==

===Lower risk of type II diabetes===
The relationship between caffeine and [[diabetes mellitus]] has been a controversial topic among scientists.

Caffeine consumption has been associated with a lower risk of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]]. The majority of the studies on this topic were done on coffee. Test results indicate that consumers who drink at least three or more cups of either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee every day show a decrease in the risk of type II diabetes. In [[Japan]], a recent study was done to examine the relationship between consumption of green, black, and oolong [[tea]]s and the risk of diabetes; and it was found that caffeine containing beverages were associated with a decreased risk of type II diabetes.<ref name="greentea">{{cite journal |pmid=16618952 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=144&page=554 |year=2006 |last1=Iso |first1=H |last2=Date |first2=C |last3=Wakai |first3=K |last4=Fukui |first4=M |last5=Tamakoshi |first5=A |last6=Jacc Study |first6=Group |title=The relationship between green tea and total caffeine intake and risk for self-reported type 2 diabetes among Japanese adults |volume=144 |issue=8 |pages=554–62 |journal=Annals of internal medicine}}</ref> The mechanism responsible for this inverse relationship between caffeine containing beverage and the risk of diabetes includes basal energy expenditure, fat oxidation stimulation, [[glycogen]] mobilization in muscles, and stimulation of increased lipolysis from peripheral tissues.<ref name="greentea"/> Unfortunately, tolerance of caffeine can develop. Certain [[antioxidant]] substances in these beverages also play roles in decreasing risks of diabetes. For example, [[epigallocatechin gallate]], present in green tea, helps by acting on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism.<ref name="greentea"/>

===Negative effects on diabetics===
Although coffee has been associated with a lowered risk of developing type 2 diabetes, it has also been claimed to have negative effects on diabetes patients, because the caffeine in regular coffee is capable of reducing insulin sensitivity and makes it difficult for patients with diabetes to control their blood glucose levels. Studies have shown that caffeine consumption increases blood glucose, but diabetes medication pills decrease blood glucose levels showing that the two counter-interact.<ref name="DeNoon">{{cite web |url=http://diabetes.webmd.com/news/20080128/caffeine-risks-may-rattle-diabetics |title=Caffeine Bad for Diabetes |last=DeNoon |first=Daniel J. |date=January 28, 2008 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}</ref>
Diabetes patients have trouble controlling their sugar level in their blood due to lack of insulin resistance hormone.<ref name="DeNoon"/>
[[Alloxan]] is a chemical that damages insulin-producing cells and creates conditions for diabetes.<ref name="DeNoon"/>
Once in the human body, caffeine produces alloxan and either produces diabetes' conditions or worsens the existing diabetes.<ref name="DeNoon"/>

===Decrease in Parkinson's disease===
[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) is the degeneration of dopamine producing neurons.<ref name="neuroprotection">{{cite journal |pmid=11319241 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11319241 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |title=Neuroprotection by Caffeine and A2A Adenosine Receptor Inactivation in a Model of Parkinson's Disease |date=2001-05-15 |author1=Jiang-Fan Chen |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=RC143 |last2=Xu |first2=K |last3=Petzer |first3=JP |last4=Staal |first4=R |last5=Xu |first5=YH |last6=Beilstein |first6=M |last7=Sonsalla |first7=PK |last8=Castagnoli |first8=K |last9=Castagnoli Jr |first9=N}}</ref> Dopamine producing neurons stimulate the motor cortex effecting motor control.<ref name="neuroprotection"/> Loss of dopamine produces loss of motor control skills, cognitive function, and autonomic nervous system.<ref name="neuroprotection"/>

===Cancers===

====Breast and ovarian cancer====
Caffeine is suspected to increase the risks in [[cancer]], because it leads to the fluctuation of plasma sex hormones and [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) in women. Circulating [[estrogens]] and [[androgens]] are important factors in female cancer development.<ref name="Kotsopoulos2009">{{cite journal |pmid=19384973 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=2009 |last1=Kotsopoulos |first1=J |last2=Eliassen |first2=AH |last3=Missmer |first3=SA |last4=Hankinson |first4=SE |last5=Tworoger |first5=SS |title=Relationship between caffeine intake and plasma sex hormone concentrations in premenopausal and postmenopausal women |volume=115 |issue=12 |pages=2765–74 |doi=10.1002/cncr.24328 |pmc=2764240 |journal=Cancer}}</ref> Recent studies show that in premenopausal women, there’s an inverse relationship between caffeine intake and total luteal and estradiol levels in the second half of the menstrual cycle, and also has a positive association with [[progesterone]] levels.<ref name="hormones">{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5667A120090707 |title=Hormones may tie caffeine to cancer risk |date=July 7, 2009 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2010-11-13 |location=New York}}</ref> Theoretically speaking, lower estrogen levels helps protect against ovarian cancer, but more research needs to be done on this topic.<ref name="hormones"/>
For postmenopausal women, increased caffeine consumption is associated with a higher level of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which reduces the estradiol and testosterone activity and decreases the risk of breast cancer.<ref name="hormones"/>

===Symptoms===

Caffeine addiction leads to some levels of physical dependence. The most frequently seen withdrawal symptoms are headache and fatigue.  Such symptoms affect consumers’ mood, but show no evidence of influencing ones’ performance. In prolonged caffeine drinkers, symptoms such as increased depression and anxiety, nausea, vomiting, physical pains and intense desire for caffeine containing beverages are also reported. The symptoms reflect consumers’ expectancy effects on caffeine to some degree.<ref name="effects"/>

[[Withdrawal|Withdrawal symptoms]]&nbsp;– including headache, irritability, inability to concentrate, drowsiness, insomnia, and pain in the stomach, upper body, and joints&nbsp;– may appear within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of caffeine intake, peak at roughly 48 hours, and usually last from 2 to 9 days.<ref name="pmid15448977">{{cite journal |pmid=15448977 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=2004 |last1=Juliano |first1=LM |last2=Griffiths |first2=RR |title=A critical review of caffeine withdrawal: Empirical validation of symptoms and signs, incidence, severity, and associated features |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=1–29 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-2000-x |journal=Psychopharmacology}}</ref> Peer knowledge, support and interaction may aid withdrawal.<ref>http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/11{{full|date=March 2013}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.healthcentral.com/anxiety/c/8146/5936/coffee-anxiety{{full|date=March 2013}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.anxietyzap.com/9-caffeine-anxiety.htm{{full|date=March 2013}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===Expectancy effects===

Studies with placebo conditions have been done to demonstrate that the effects of caffeine depend greatly on the consumer’s expectations.<ref name="effects"/> When heavy caffeine drinkers are led to believe that they are consuming beverages that contain caffeine, they tend to perform better regardless of the caffeine content within the sample that was given to them.

===Effect of genetics on withdrawal symptoms===

Gene polymorphism could be associated with caffeine withdrawal symptoms and beta 1and beta-2 play roles in caffeine withdrawal.<ref name="Day-Tasevski">{{cite book |last=Day-Tasevski |first=Erica |date=6 April 2010 |title=Genetic Determinants of the Acute Effects and Withdrawal Symptoms of Caffeine |type=MSc Thesis |publisher=University of Toronto |id={{hdl|1807/24245}}}}{{pn|date=March 2013}}</ref> For example, compared to people with homozygous Gly16 allele, consumers with the heterozygote ADR beta-2 Gly16 Arg gene polymorphism have a higher chance of feeling fatigue after 48 hours of caffeine withdrawal.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> It has been suspected that beta2- adrenoceptors are the main cause to this increase in mental fatigue symptom.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> Beta 2- adrenoceptors are receptors that regulate glycogenolysis, secret insulin and intramuscularly transport glucose that are used for cerebral and muscle activity.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> Another example is given by the genes ADRbeta1 Gly16 Arg and CYP1A2-163A>C polymorphisms.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> They are associated with the consumers’ mood swing and increased depression level.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> Among subjects homozygous for the CYP1A2 allele, ADRbeta1 Gly389 allele carriers are reported to have a higher percentage of depression level increase when compared to Arg389 homozygotes subjects.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> Adrenergic receptors, again, play a key role in this symptom, as altered norepinephrine neurotransmission, an adrenoceptor agonist, contribute to the etiology of depression.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/> This symptom is often seen in faster caffeine metabolizers, because caffeine effects diminish quicker in these consumers and provide them less opportunity to adapt to caffeine loss.<ref name="Day-Tasevski"/>

==Recommendations==

===Adults===
[[Health Canada]] has not developed definitive advice for adolescents 13 and older because of insufficient data. Nonetheless, Health Canada suggests that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without suffering adverse effects. For the rest of the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400&nbsp;mg.<ref name="itsyourhealth"/>

According to the US-based Waverly Health Center, three 8&nbsp;oz cups of coffee (about 250 milligrams of caffeine) per day is considered an average or moderate amount of caffeine; ten 8&nbsp;oz cups of coffee per day is considered an excessive intake of caffeine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waverlyhealthcenter.org/internal/forms/handout_53.PDF|publisher=Waverly Health Center|accessdate=2010-12-01|title=(untitled)}}</ref>

===Pregnant women===
Caffeine's potential impact on female fertility, and its precise impact on pregnancy, is still being studied, but caution and moderation, as with many other substances in these cases, is warranted in any case until further information is known. For women of childbearing age, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300&nbsp;mg, or a little over two 8&nbsp;oz (237&nbsp;mL) cups of coffee.<ref name="itsyourhealth"/>

===Children===
For children age 12 and under, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Based on average body weights of children, this translates to the following age-based intake limits:<ref name="itsyourhealth">{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/food-aliment/caffeine-eng.php|title=It's Your Health&nbsp;— Caffeine|date=March 2010|publisher=[[Health Canada]]|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref>

Relatedly, one study found that caffeine can be used to treat hyperkinetic children.<ref name="hyperkinetic">{{cite journal |pmid=4712736 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=1973 |last1=Schnackenberg |first1=RC |title=Caffeine as a substitute for Schedule II stimulants in hyperkinetic children |volume=130 |issue=7 |pages=796–8 |journal=The American journal of psychiatry}}</ref> The research showed 200–300&nbsp;mg of caffeine has a similar effect to [[methylphenidate]] in treating hyperkinetic impulse disorder. Moreover, the caffeine treatment did not show the side-effects caused by methylphenidate.<ref name="hyperkinetic"/
Moderate caffeine intake has been reported to help children with ADHD with their focus time. Most ADHD children have a foucus time of less than a minute at a time. Giving a child with ADHD a drink with at least 50&nbsp;mg of caffeine, mainly coffee without added sugar can help increase this focus time. It also is reported to help calm or slow down the hyperactive behaviors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Labeling requirements===
It is a regulatory requirement that the label of most prepackaged foods must declare a list of ingredients, including food additives such as caffeine, in descending order of proportion. However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). As for "natural caffeine", there are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for "food additive caffeine", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g. [[guarana]], [[yerba maté]]) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18809264 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924075307.htm |laydate=September 25, 2008 |laysource=ScienceDaily |year=2009 |last1=Reissig |first1=CJ |last2=Strain |first2=EC |last3=Griffiths |first3=RR |title=Caffeinated energy drinks--a growing problem |volume=99 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.08.001 |pmc=2735818 |journal=Drug and alcohol dependence}}</ref>

The combination of caffeine (a stimulant) and alcohol (a depressant) is dangerous for one's health and not recommended by health professionals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This is because the former increases wake-promoting neurons, while the latter decreases wake-promoting neurons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Alcohol is a GABA agonist and binds into the GABA receptors and decreases serotonin and acetylcholine activity, whereas caffeine increases acetylcholine and serotonin neurotransmission and decreases GABA.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Effect of orally administered birth control on caffeine==
Consumption of caffeine while orally administering birth control can extend the half-life of caffeine; therefore, greater attention should be taken during caffeine consumption.<ref name="Benowitz1990" />
