Vidant Medical Transport helped VMC become a level 1 trauma center in November 1985.<ref name="PCMH"/>  It expanded to critical care ground transport in 1994.<ref name="ECBSOM">{{cite web   | title = EastCare   | work = ECU Emergency Medicine| publisher = The Brody School of Medicine   | year = 2009   | url = http://author.ecu.edu/cs-dhs/ecuem/div/EC.cfm   | accessdate = October 20, 2010}}</ref>  By 2000, VMC adds a second helicopter to their fleet.  Also, VMC begins the construction of a new emergency department.  The four-story emergency department is a two-helicopter rooftop [[Helipad|landing pad]] which was complete in November 2003.  The communication center is also located on the top floor of this tower, overlooking the helipad.<ref>{{cite web   | title = Economic History of Pitt County 1690–2010    | work =    | publisher = Pitt County Development Commission    | date = June 2010   | url = http://locateincarolina.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Economic_History_of_Pitt_County_Version_2.pdf   | accessdate = October 13, 2010}}</ref><ref name="UHS"/> In 2009, the ground ambulances went on more than 10,000 trips.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Freedman|first=Alex    | title = EastCare celebrates birthday, new technology in medical transport   | newspaper = WNCT   | publisher = Media General Communications Holdings, LLC   | date = October 19, 2010   | url = http://wnct.com/ar/467402/   | accessdate = October 20, 2010}}</ref>

Most of the cabin was burned away and the last body was removed at around 2:00&nbsp;am and all taken to [[Jacksonville, North Carolina|Jacksonville]].

VMC turned into a [[landing zone]] for helicopters landing and departing. VMC at the time owned one helicopter.  Vidant Medical Transport flew 102 missions from landfall to ten days later.  The first mission occurred on the afternoon of landfall.  Vidant Medical Transport transported a woman who had been rescued [[Pinetops, North Carolina|Pinetops]] from her rooftop who was nearing labor.<ref name=Fran>{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Doug|title=As Water Soaked the Ground, PCMH Aircraft Filled the Sky|url=http://media.lib.ecu.edu/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=236|work=Joyner Library|publisher=East Carolina University|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  The situation far exceeded VMC's aerial capability.  [[Mission Health System|Mission St. Joseph's Health System]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] sent one helicopter for two days, the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] sent one helicopter and two teams for six days and [[Air Methods|Rocky Mountain Air]], the company that owned the Vidant Medical Transport helicopters at the time, sent one helicopter for two days.  Many [[military helicopter]]s from the [[North Carolina Air National Guard]] were used to help rescue survivors and bring them to the hospital.<ref name=Fran />   At the height of the aftermath there were as many as thirty helicopter missions each day, more than ten times the rate normally.  A few days after the storm hit, the staff was fatigued and was replaced.  It became Vidant Medical Transport's job to fly and pick up staff who work at the hospital.  Vidant Medical Transport also transported patients and supplies to and from the hospital.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Lindberg| first = Curt| title = Pitt County Memorial Hospital – Weathering and Weaving: Lessons from the Trenches | publisher = Plexus Institute| url = http://www.plexusinstitute.org/ideas/show_story.cfm?id=24| accessdate = October 21, 2010}}</ref>

Vidant Medical Transport used Eurocopter helicopters since the mid-1980s.  The three new helicopters are replacing three Eurocopter [[MBB/Kawasaki BK 117|BK-117]]s that were operated on a lease arrangement and flown by [[Air Methods]].<ref>{{Cite press release| title = American Eurocopter delivers 2 EC145s, 1 EC135P2+ to EastCare air medical transport service in NC| publisher = American Eurocopter| date = October 11, 2010| url = http://www.eurocopterusa.com/news_press-release/2010/10-11-2010-Delivers-to-EastCare-air.asp| accessdate = October 14, 2010}}</ref>  The helicopters run around 2,400 times per year, with the average one-way flight being 30 minutes.<ref name="ECBSOM"/>  The callsign for dispatch is "Vidant Communications" and for the helicopters are "Air 1", "Air 2" and "Air 3".<ref name="Dial Codes"/>

==Ground transport==
Vidant Medical Transport began critical care ground transport in 1994.  The ambulances include two neonatal transfer ambulances and ten type-I ambulances.  There are also six ambulances for [[advanced life support|advanced]] and [[basic life support]].  The ground transport vehicles are primary stationed either in Greenville or at one of the satellite stations.  The other stations are [[Bertie County, North Carolina|Bertie County]], [[Duplin County, North Carolina|Duplin County]], [[Halifax County, North Carolina|Halifax County]] and [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow County]].<ref name="UHS"/>

==Awards and recognitions ==
In 1993, it was the first program east of the [[Mississippi River]] and fifth overall to be accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems]]. By 1996, it was the first program to be re-accredited and the first to be accredited for critical-care ground transport.<ref>{{cite web   | last = Boyd   | first = Doug    | title = EastCare transport program named best of year   | work = Division of Health Sciences news   | publisher = East Carolina University News Bureau   | date = December 5, 2000   | url = http://www.ecu.edu/news/newsstory.cfm?ID=314   | accessdate = October 12, 2010}}</ref>  In 2000, it was selected as the Program of the Year by the Association of Air Medical Services.
