NET is a [[monoamine transporter]] and  is responsible for the sodium-chloride (Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>–</sup>)-dependent [[reuptake]] of extracellular [[norepinephrine]] (NE), which is also known as noradrenaline. NET can also reuptake extracellular [[dopamine]] (DA). The reuptake of these two [[neurotransmitter]]s is essential in regulating concentrations in the [[synaptic cleft]]. NETs, along with the other monoamine transporters, are the targets of many antidepressants and recreational drugs. In addition, a deficiency of NET is associated with many affective and autonomic disorders such as [[orthostatic intolerance]] and [[ADHD]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author = S. Schroeter, S.

==Gene==

The norepinephrine transporter gene, SLC6A2 is located on human [[chromosome 16]] locus 16q12.2. This gene is encoded by 14 [[exon]]s.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> Based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence, the NET transporter consists of 617 amino acids with 12 membrane-spanning domains. The structural organization of NET is highly homologous to other members of a sodium/chloride-dependent family of neurotransmitter transporters, including dopamine, epinephrine, [[serotonin]] and [[GABA transporter 1|GABA transporters]].<ref name="pmid14987367"/>

=== Single nucleotide polymorphisms ===
A [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) is a genetic variation in which a genome sequence is altered by a single nucleotide ([[adenine|A]], [[thymine|T]], [[cytosine|C]] or [[guanine|G]]). NET proteins with an altered amino acid sequence (more specifically, a [[missense mutation]]) could potentially be associated with various diseases that involve abnormally high or low plasma levels of [[norepinephrine]] due to altered NET function. NET SNPs and possible associations with various diseases are an area of focus for many research projects. There is evidence suggesting a relationship between NET SNPs and various disorders such as ADHD<ref name="pmid14987367"/><ref name="pmid17146058">{{cite journal | author = Kim CH, Hahn MK, Joung Y, Anderson SL, Steele AH, Mazei-Robinson MS, Gizer I, Teicher MH, Cohen BM, Robertson D, Waldman ID, Blakely RD, Kim KS | title = A polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter gene alters promoter activity and is associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder | journal = Proc.

== Function ==

NET functions to transport synaptically released [[norepinephrine]] back into the presynaptic neuron. As much as 90% of the norepinephrine released will be taken back up in the cell by NET. NET functions by coupling the influx of sodium and chloride (Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>–</sup>) with the transport of norepinephrine. This occurs at a fixed ratio of 1:1:1.<ref name="Galli">{{cite journal | author = Galli A, DeFelice LJ, Duke BJ, Moore KR, Blakely RD | title = Sodium-dependent norepinephrine-induced currents in norepinephrine-transporter-transfected HEK-293 cells blocked by cocaine and antidepressants | journal = J.

[[File:Norepinephrine structure.svg|thumb|Norepinephrine structure]]
Norepinephrine (NE) is released from [[norepinephrine|noradrenergic]] neurons that innervate both the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|PNS]]. NE, also known as noradrenaline (NA), has an important role in controlling mood, arousal, memory, learning, and pain perception. NE is a part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]].<ref name=Schroeter /><ref name="pmid16871320">{{cite journal | author = Zhou J | title = Norepinephrine transporter inhibitors and their therapeutic potential | journal = Drugs Future | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1235–1244 | year = 2004 | month = December | pmid = 16871320 | pmc = 1518795 | doi = 10.1358/dof.2004.029.12.855246}}</ref> Dysregulation of the removal of norepinephrine by NET is associated with many neuropsychiatric diseases, discussed below . In addition, many antidepressants and recreational drugs compete for the binding of NET with NE.<ref name=Stober />

== Transport mechanisms ==

The transport of norepinephrine back into presynaptic cell is made possible by the cotransport with Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. The sequential binding of the ions results in the eventual reuptake of norepinephrine. The ion gradients of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> make this reuptake energetically favorable. The gradient is generated by the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]] which transports three sodium ions out and two potassium ions into the cell.<ref name=Torres /> NETs have conductances similar to those of [[ligand-gated ion channel]]s. The expression of NET results in a leak-channel activity.<ref name=Galli /><ref name=Torres />

== Location in the nervous system ==

NETs are restricted to [[norepinephrine|noradrenergic]] neurons and are not present on neurons that release dopamine or epinephrine.<ref name=Schroeter /><ref name=Sager /><ref name=Torres />  The transporters can be found along the cell body, [[axon]]s, and [[dendrite]]s of the neuron.<ref name=Schroeter /> NETs are located away from the synapse, where norepinephrine is released. They are found closer to the plasma membrane of the cell. This requires norepinephrine to diffuse from the site it is released to the transporter for reuptake.<ref name=Torres /> Norepinephrine transporters are confined to the neurons of the sympathetic system, and those innervating the adrenal medulla, lung, and placenta.<ref name=Torres />

==Regulation==

Regulation of NET function is complex and a focus of current research. NETs are regulated at both the cellular and molecular level post-translation. The most understood mechanisms include phosphorylation by the second messenger [[protein kinase C]] (PKC).<ref name=Sager />  PKC has been shown to inhibit NET function by sequestration of the transporter from the plasma membrane.<ref name="Gether">{{cite journal | author = Gether U, Andersen PH, Larsson OM, Schousboe A | title = Neurotransmitter transporters: molecular function of important drug targets | journal = Trends Pharmacol.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Orthostatic intolerance ===
{{Main|Orthostatic intolerance}}
Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a disorder of the [[autonomic nervous system]] (a subcategory of [[dysautonomia]]) characterized by the onset of symptoms upon standing. Symptoms include fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, increased heart rate/[[heart palpitations]], anxiety, and altered vision.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> Oftentimes, patients have high plasma [[norepinephrine]] (NE) concentrations (at least 600 pg/ml) in relation to sympathetic outflow upon standing, suggesting OI is a hyper[[adrenergic]] condition.<ref name="pmid14987367"/><ref name="pmid10684912"/>
The discovery of identical twin sisters both suffering from OI suggested a genetic basis for the disorder.<ref name="pmid14987367"/><ref name="pmid10684912"/> A [[missense mutation]] on the NET gene (SLC62A) was discovered in which an [[alanine]] residue was replaced with a [[proline]] residue (Ala457Pro) in a highly conserved region of the transporter.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> The patients’ defective NET had only 2% of the activity of the [[wild type|wild-type]] version of the gene.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> The genetic defect in the NET protein results in decreased NET activity that could account for abnormally high NE plasma levels in OI. However, 40 other OI patients did not have the same missense mutation, indicating other factors contributed to the phenotype in the identical twins.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> This discovery of the linkage with NET mutations that results in decreased norepinephrine [[reuptake]] activity and orthostatic intolerance suggests faulty NE uptake mechanisms can contribute to cardiovascular disease.<ref name="pmid11804991">{{cite journal | author = Schroeder C, Tank J, Boschmann M, Diedrich A, Sharma AM, Biaggioni I, Luft FC, Jordan J | title = Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibition as a human model of orthostatic intolerance | journal = Circulation | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–53 | year = 2002 | month = January | pmid = 11804991 | doi = 10.1161/hc0302.102597 }}</ref>

Certain [[antidepressant]] medications act to raise noradrenaline, such as [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs), [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NDRIs), [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs or NERIs) and the [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs). The mechanism by which these medications work is that the reuptake inhibitors prevent the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine by the [[presynaptic neuron]], paralyzing the normal function of the NET.  At the same time, higher levels of [[5-HT]] are maintained in the synapse increasing the concentrations of the latter neurotransmitters.

For many years, the number one choice in treating mood disorders like depression was through the uptake of TCAs, such as [[desipramine]] (Norpramin), [[nortriptyline]] (Arentyl, Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil) and [[amoxapine]] (Asendin).<ref name="pmid16871320"/>  However, currently far more potent drugs have been developed in the United States, most notably the discovery of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs).  SSRIs affect the communication between chemical messengers in the brain by regulating how much of a certain chemical messenger enters the brain.<ref name="pmid16871320"/> SSRIs regulate serotonin levels in the brain, which seems to aid the brain in exchanging messages more efficiently and in turn livens mood.<ref name = "Mayo Clinic">{{Citation | last = Mayo Clinic Staff | first = | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ssris/MH00066 | accessdate = 1 November 2011}}</ref>  Drugs such as [[fluoxetine]] and [[paroxetine]] are both very impelling in treating mood disorders because they reduce many of the side effects one receives compared to using TCAs to treat such mood disorders.<ref name = "Mayo Clinic"/>

}}</ref> The only relationship that has been understood between researchers is that there is a positive correlation between increased NE levels in the brain and [[Cerebrospinal fluid|spinal fluid]] (CSF) and activity of schizophrenia.<ref name = "Decaire"/><ref name = "Breier"/><ref name = "Sternberg"/><ref name = "Kammen"/> In one study, [[clonidine]], a drug used to treat medical conditions such as [[ADHD]] and high blood pressure, was shown to produce a significant decrease in plasma level [[3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol|MHPG]] (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol), a metabolite of NE, in the normal control group, but not in the group of schizophrenic patients.<ref name = "Sternberg"/> This suggests that in schizophrenia, the [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor]], a presynaptic inhibitory receptor, may be less sensitive compared to normally functioning alpha-2 receptors and thus relate to elevated NE levels in the disorder.<ref name = "Sternberg"/> In addition to increased NE levels in the brain and CSF, increased levels of MHPG has also been associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.<ref name = "Kammen"/> Impaired NE regulation in schizophrenia has been an area of interest for researchers and research on this topic is still ongoing.<ref name = "Sternberg"/><ref name = "Kammen"/>
