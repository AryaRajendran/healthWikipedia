This increase in leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) is usually accompanied by a '''"left shift"''' in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils. The increase in immature leukocytes increases due to proliferation and release of granulocyte and monocyte precursors in the bone marrow which is stimulated by several products of inflammation including C3a and G-CSF.
Although it may indicate illness, leukocytosis is considered a laboratory finding instead of a separate [[disease]].  This classification is similar to that of [[fever]], which is also a test result instead of a disease.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
'''"Right shift"''' in the ratio of immature to mature [[neutrophils]] is considered with reduced count or lack of "young neutrophils" ([[metamyelocytes]], and [[Band cell|band neutrophils]]) in [[blood smear]], associated with the presence of "giant neutrophils". This fact shows suppression of bone marrow activity, as a hematological sign specific for [[pernicious anemia]] and [[radiation sickness]].<ref>Lutan, Vasile. Fiziopatologie medicală. Vol. 2, 31.3.2.1. Leucocitozele; http://library.usmf.md/ebooks.php?key=b11</ref>

A leukocyte count above 25 to 30 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre|L]] is termed a ''[[leukemoid reaction]]'', which is the reaction of a healthy bone marrow to extreme stress, trauma, or infection. It is different from [[leukemia]] and from [[leukoerythroblastosis]], in which either immature white blood cells (acute leukemia) or mature, yet non-functional, white blood cells (chronic leukemia) are present in peripheral blood. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Leukocyte counts==
Below are [[Reference ranges for blood tests|blood reference ranges]] for various types leucocytes/WBCs.<ref>Specific references are found in article [[Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests#White_blood_cells_2]].</ref> The 97.5 percentile (right limits in intervals in image, showing 95% [[prediction interval]]s) is a common limit for defining leukocytosis.

==Classification==
Leukocytosis can be subcategorized by the type of white blood cell that is increased in number. Leukocytosis in which [[neutrophils]] are elevated is [[neutrophilia]]; leukocytosis in which [[lymphocyte]] count is elevated is [[lymphocytosis]]; leukocytosis in which [[monocyte]] count is elevated is [[monocytosis]]; and leukocytosis in which [[eosinophil]] count is elevated is [[eosinophilia]].<ref name=Kumar12-6>Table 12-6 in: {{Citation |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

Leukocytosis is very common in acutely ill patients. It occurs in response to a wide variety of conditions, including viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection, cancer, hemorrhage, and exposure to certain medications or chemicals including steroids.

For lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, WBC count is very important for the diagnosis of the disease, as leukocytosis is usually present.

The mechanism that causes leukocytosis can be of several forms: an increased release of leukocytes from [[bone marrow]] storage pools, decreased margination of leukocytes onto vessel walls, decreased [[leukocyte extravasation|extravasation]] of leukocytes from the vessels into tissues, or an increase in number of precursor cells in the marrow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Certain medications, including [[corticosteroid]]s, [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] and [[beta agonists]], may cause leukocytosis.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20001101/2053.html Leukocytosis: Basics of Clinical Assessment], ''American Family Physician''.  November 2000.</ref>
