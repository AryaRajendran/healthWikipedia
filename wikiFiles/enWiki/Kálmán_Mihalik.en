'''Kálmán Mihalik''' (21 February 1896 – 6 September 1922)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC09732/10481.htm|title=Kálmán Mihalik Biography|publisher=Hungarian Biographical Encylopedia (Magyar Életrajzi Lexikon)|accessdate=21 May 2012|language=Hungarian}}</ref> was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] physician and composer, best known for setting the music of the [[Székely Himnusz]].

==Early life and studies==
Mihalik was born in [[Oravița|Oravicabánya]] (Oravița) to a [[Székely]] woman from [[Csík County]] and a burgess from [[Košice|Kassa]] (Košice). He absolved his high school studies in the Piarist and the Unitarian grammar school of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár]] (Cluj-Napoca), making his matura in 1915. Subsequently, Mihalik was enrolled at the [[Franz Joseph University]], however, his studies were interrupted by the World War I, forcing him to spend several years on the front. In the final period of the war, after the Romanian forces took over Kolozsvár, the university moved first to [[Budapest]] and later to [[Szeged]], where Mihalik followed them. After finishing his studies he remained in the university, became the assistant lecturer of [[Béla Reinbold]] and worked as a medical researcher.<ref name=szegedma>{{cite web|url=http://szegedma.hu/hir/szeged/2009/09/haromszoros-szekely-jubileum-szegeden.html|title=Háromszoros székely jubileum Szegeden|publisher=Szeged Ma|date=5 September 2009|accessdate=21 June 2012|language=Hungarian}}</ref>

==Composer of the Székely Himnusz==
{{main|Székely Himnusz}}
In 1920, together with four others, [[György Csanády]] founded the Association of Székely University and College Students (Székely Egyetemista és Főiskolai Hallgatók Egyesülete; SZEFHE), a self-help organization that aimed to create a sense of belonging of those who had to fled their home after the war, and whose homeland was ceded to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1921, Csanády wrote a poem for students in exile, for which Mihalik, a long term friend of Csanády, composed the music. The song written for girls choir was first performed on 22 May 1922 at the annual meeting of SZEFHE, under the title ''Kantáté''.<ref name=kriza>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitarius.hu/eloadasok/kriza-ildiko-szekely-himnusz.htm|title=A Székely himnusz születésének háttere|publisher=Unitarian Church in Hungary|first=Ildikó|last=Kríza|accessdate=21 June 2012|language=Hungarian}}</ref>

Mihalik died in the autumn of 1922. In his obituary, presumably written by Csanády, the song was already called ''Székely Himnusz'', under which name it became well known later. Although after the World War II it was banned both in the Communist Hungary and Romania, the song remained popular and turned into a symbol of resistance and togetherness,<ref name=kriza /> and on 5 September 2009 it was adopted as the anthem of [[Székely Land]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sznt.ro/hu-sic/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=318&lang=hu|title=A Székelyföldi Önkormányzati Nagygyűlés határozatai|publisher=Székely Nemzeti Tanács (Szekler National Council)|date=5 September 2009|accessdate=21 June 2012|language=Hungarian|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68aIMk2dM|archivedate=21 June 2012}}</ref>
