They are applied across the laceration in a manner which pulls the skin on either side of the wound together. Steri-strips may be used instead of [[Surgical suture|suture]]s (stitches) in some injuries, because they lessen [[scarring]] and are easier to care for.

The precursor to the steri-strip was [[Microporous material|Micropore]] Surgical Tape. Reports exist{{Where|date=July 2011}} of dramatic cases where Micropore Surgical tape alone was used to hold large abdominal incisions together when the skin was too fragile to accommodate sutures and another where one patient's [[abdominal wall]] was literally rebuilt with the tape and his life saved when sutures on the patient's compromised skin failed to hold the wound closed.  These reports prompted 3M to cut Micropore Surgical Tape into one-eighth inch, one-fourth inch and one-half inch ({{convert|0.125|in|mm|1|disp=output number only}}, {{convert|0.25|in|mm|1|disp=output number only}}, and {{convert|0.5|in|mm|1|disp=output only}}) strips, sterilise and package it as primary surface closures for incisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/SH/SkinHealth/brands/steri-strip/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GE3E02LECFTDQGKG7_nid=GSFWXQWVM8be29FKGVD9QMgl |title=3M.com Redirect Page |publisher=Solutions.3m.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref>

One of the drawbacks of the construction of steri-strips is the fact they are paper based, this means that their durability can be compromised if they get wet. Products such as Leukostrip have been developed that are made of a synthetic material that will repel water and therefore remain in place longer.

==Usage==
Steri-strips are ideal for use in highly contoured areas or areas of musculoskeletal movements, such as joints. They are also for use in areas where swelling, edema, hematomas, or bloating may occur.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Additionally, they provide wound support following early suture or staple removal.

==Benefits==
Steri-strips help prevent [[Pruning (maceration)|maceration]]. They result in less scarring when compared to staples or sutures. They present a lesser chance of infection than sutures or staples.

==Variations==

#'''Reinforced skin closures''': These are sterile skin closure strips that are made of a porous, non-woven backing coated with a pressure-sensitive, hypoallergenic adhesive and reinforced with polyester filaments for added strength. They provide general wound support for increased tensile strength and finer wound edge approximation.
#'''Blend tone skin closures non-reinforced''': These are sterile, light beige skin closure strips made of a porous, non-woven backing coated with a pressure-sensitive, hypoallergenic adhesive. They blend with and allow the natural skin tone to show through. They are for use in areas where a cosmetically pleasing appearance is desirable, such as the face or arms.
