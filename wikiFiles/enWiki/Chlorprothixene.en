'''Chlorprothixene''' ('''Cloxan''', '''Taractan''', '''Truxal''') is a [[typical antipsychotic]] [[drug]] of the [[thioxanthene]] class and was the first of the series to be synthesized.<ref name="isbn0-674-03958-0">{{cite book | author = Healy, David | title = The antidepressant era | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1997 | page = 182 | isbn = 0-674-03958-0 | oclc = | doi = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=6lpHd_P4VOsC&lpg=RA2-PA182&dq=chlorprothixene%20antidepressant&as_brr=3&pg=RA2-PA182#v=onepage&q=chlorprothixene%20antidepressant&f=false}}</ref> It was introduced in 1959 by [[Lundbeck]].<ref name="isbn0-471-89980-1">{{cite book | author = Sneader, Walter | title = Drug discovery: a history | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2005 | page = 410 | isbn = 0-471-89980-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&lpg=PA410&dq=chlorprothixene%20introduced%201958&pg=PA410#v=onepage&q=chlorprothixene%20introduced%201958&f=false}}</ref>

Chlorprothixene is not approved for use in the United States.

== Pharmacology ==

Chlorprothixene exerts strong [[receptor antagonist|antagonism]] at the following [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:

* [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]]: antipsychotic effects, anxiolysis, weight gain
* [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub>]]: antipsychotic effects, sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, prolactin increase, depression, apathy/anhedonia, weight gain
* [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]]: sedation, weight gain
* [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh]]: anticholinergic effects, inhibition of extrapyramidal side effects
* [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]]: hypotension, tachycardia

Chlorprothixene does also act as [[FIASMA]] (functional inhibitor of [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|acid sphingomyelinase]]).<ref name="pmid18504571">{{cite journal |author=Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer T, Spitzer G, Liedl K, Gulbins E, Tripal P|title=Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23852|year=2011|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023852|pmid=21909365|pmc=3166082}}</ref>

== Indications ==

Chlorprothixene's principal indications are the treatment of [[psychotic disorder]]s (e.g. [[schizophrenia]]) and of acute [[mania]] occurring as part of [[bipolar disorder]]s. 

Other uses are pre- and postoperative states with anxiety and insomnia, severe nausea / emesis (in hospitalized patients), the amelioration of anxiety and agitation due to use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s for [[clinical depression|depression]] and, off-label, the amelioration of alcohol and opioid withdrawal. It may also be used cautiously to treat nonpsychotic irritability, aggression, and insomnia in pediatric patients. 

An intrinsic [[antidepressant]] effect of chlorprothixene has been discussed, but not proven yet. Likewise, it is unclear, if chlorprothixene has genuine (intrinsic) [[analgesic]] effects. However, chlorprothixene can be used as comedication in severe chronic pain. Also, like most antipsychotics, chlorprothixene has [[antiemetic]] effects.

== Side effects ==

Chlorprothixene has a strong sedative activity with a high incidence of [[anticholinergic]] side effects. The types of side effects encountered (dry mouth, massive [[hypotension]] and [[tachycardia]], [[hyperhidrosis]], substantial weight gain etc.) normally do not allow a full effective dose for the remission of psychotic disorders to be given. So cotreatment with another, more potent, antipsychotic agent is needed. 

Chlorprothixene is structurally related to [[chlorpromazine]], with which it shares, in principle, all side effects. Allergic side effects and liver damage seem to appear with an appreciable lower frequency. The elderly are particularly sensitive to anticholinergic side effects of chlorprothixene (precipitation of narrow angle [[glaucoma]], severe obstipation, difficulties in urinating, confusional and delirant states). In patients >60 years the doses should be particularly low.

Early and late [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] may occur but have been noted with a low frequency (one study with a great number of participants has delivered a total number of only 1%).

== Dosage ==

The initial doses of chlorprothixene should always be as low as possible (e.g. 30&nbsp;mg at bedtime, 15&nbsp;mg morning dose) and be increased gradually. Patients receiving 90&nbsp;mg daily (and more) of the drug should be hospitalized, particularly during the initial phase of treatment. The theoretical maximum is 800&nbsp;mg daily which can usually not be given due to side effects as stated above. Elderly and pediatric patients should be treated with particular low initial doses. Dose increments should be done slowly. If chlorprothixene is to be withdrawn, it should not be stopped abruptly, but the dose should be decreased steadily.

== Interactions ==

Chlorprothixene may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given [[lithium]]. In order to avoid lithium intoxication, lithium plasma levels should be monitored closely.

If chlorprothixene is given concomitantly with [[opioid]]s, the opioid dose should be reduced (by approx. 50%), because chlorprothixene amplifies the therapeutic actions and side effects of opioids considerably.

Avoid the concomitant use of chlorprothixene and [[tramadol]] (Ultram). Seizures may be encountered with this combination.

Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if chlorprothixene is given with [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s. Choose particular low doses of these drugs.

Exert particular caution in combining chlorprothixene with other anticholinergic drugs ([[tricyclic antidepressant]]s and [[antiparkinsonian]] agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe [[obstipation]], even [[ileus]] and glaucoma .

==Chemistry==
Chlorprothixene (2-chloro-9[(1-dimethylamino)-3-propyliden]thioxanthene) is made starting from 2-chlorothixantone. 2-Chlorothixantone, in turn, is prepared from 2-mercaptobenzoic acid, the reaction of which with 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene forms 2-(4-chlorophenylthio)benzoic acid, which upon reaction with [[phosphorus pentachloride]] transforms into acid chloride, and further undergoes intramolecular cyclization with the use of [[aluminum chloride]] to give 2-chlorthioxantone.
*H. Spiegelberg, K. Doeben, {{Cite patent|DE|1044103}} (1957).
An alternative way of making 2-chlorthioxantone is by making 2-(4-chlorophenylthio)benzoic acid by reacting 2-iodobenzoic acid with 4-chlorothiophenol.
*E.L. Engelhardt, J.M. Sprague, {{US Patent|2951082}} (1960).
[[File:2-chlorthioxantone.png|600px|center]]
The resulting 2-chlorothioxantone is reacted as a [[carbonyl]] component with either 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesiumbromide (see Engelhardt above), or with allylmagnesiumbromide, giving the corresponding tertiary alcohol.
*V.P. Petersen, H.O. Trokil, {{US Patent|3116291}} (1963).
*Kefalas Aktieselskab, {{Cite patent|DE|1168446}} (1959).
*Kefalas Aktieselskabet, {{Cite patent|DE|1418517}} (1959).
[[File:Chlorprothixene synthesis.png|400px|center]]
Dehydration of the first is accomplished by [[acylation]] of the tertiary hydroxyl group using
[[acetyl chloride]] and the subsequent [[pyrolysis]] of the formed acetate, which leads to the desired chlorprothixene.
In the second case, dehydration of the tertiary alcohol is accomplished by chlorination of the tertiary alcohol group by [[thionyl chloride]], forming the diene 2-chloro-9-(3-propen-1-
iliden)thioxanthene, the addition to which of [[dimethylamine]] at high temperature forms the desired chlorprothixene.
