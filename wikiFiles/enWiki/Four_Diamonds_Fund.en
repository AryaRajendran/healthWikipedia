'''The Four Diamonds Fund''' is a [[charitable organization|charitable]] organization based out of [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]]. Its ultimate objective is to "conquer childhood [[cancer]]".

The fund was established in 1972 by Charles and Irma Millard following the death of their son Chris from pediatric cancer. The name refers to ''[[The Four Diamonds]]'', a [[fantasy]] story written by Chris shortly before succumbing to the disease at the age of 14.<ref>[http://journelism.org/articles/philanthropy/the-four-diamonds-fund The Four Diamonds Fund: The Legacy of Sir Millard]</ref>

==Foundation==
The Four Diamonds Fund takes a three-pronged approach to this: medical care, financial and emotional support, and [[pediatric]] cancer research. Any child being treated for pediatric cancer at Penn State Hershey is eligible for support, and the fund's policy is to fully cover all medical costs not paid by insurance. Essentially, families never see a bill. Approximately 90 new families receive support each year.

These efforts are partially funded by the [[Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon]] (THON), an annual student-run philanthropy at Penn State. The fund leads several events for the families and contributors. Events, such as the Annual 5K Run/Fun Walk are held annually. [[Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon|THON]] is a major contributor to the organization and as of 2013 has raised more than $100 million for the fund since 1977.<ref>[http://www.publicopiniononline.com/localnews/ci_16518608 Chambersburg Area Senior High School event to raise money for Four Diamonds Fund - Chambersburg Public Opinion]</ref>
