'''Newborn screening''' is a [[public health]] program designed to screen infants shortly after birth for a list of conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period.  Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of the disease.   Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction.  The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly.  Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and [[enzyme]] activity in [[whole blood]] samples collected on specialized [[filter paper]], however many areas are starting to screen infants for [[hearing loss]] using  automated auditory brainstem response and [[congenital heart defects]] using [[pulse oximetry]].  Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a [[false positive]].  Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between [[geneticists]] and the infant's [[pediatrician]] or [[primary care physician]].

Newborn screening debuted as a public health program in the [[United States]] in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world, with different testing menus in each country.  The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was [[phenylketonuria]], a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential [[amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] can cause irreversible [[mental retardation]] unless detected early.  With early detection, and dietary management, the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated.  [[Robert Guthrie]] developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born.  Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale.  Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper.

==History==
[[Robert Guthrie]] is given much of the credit for pioneering the earliest screening for [[phenylketonuria]] in the late 1960s using [[blood]] samples on [[filter paper]] obtained by pricking a newborn baby's heel on the second day of life to get a few drops of blood.<ref name="pmid11728413">{{cite journal| author = Clague A, Thomas A| title = Neonatal biochemical screening for disease

In the [[United States]], the [[American College of Medical Genetics]] recommended a uniform panel of diseases that all infants born in every state should be screened for.  They also developed an evidence-based review process for the addition of conditions in the future.  The implementation of this panel across the United States meant all babies born would be screened for the same number of conditions. Prior to this, babies born in different states had received different levels of screening.  On April 24, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007]]. This act was enacted to increase awareness among parents, health professionals, and the public on testing newborns to identify certain disorders. It also sought to improve, expand, and enhance current newborn screening programs at the state level.

==Disease qualification==
Newborn screening programs initially used [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] criteria based largely on criteria established by JMG Wilson and F. Jungner in 1968.<ref name=wilsonjungner>{{cite pmid|4234760}}</ref>  Although not specifically about newborn population screening programs, their publication, ''Principles and practice of screening for disease'' proposed ten criteria that screening programs should meet before being used as a [[public health]] measure.  Newborn screening programs are administered in each jurisdiction, with additions and removals from the panel typically reviewed by a panel of experts.  The four criteria from the publication that were relied upon when making decisions for early newborn screening programs were: 
# having an acceptable treatment protocol in place that changes the outcome for patients diagnosed early with the disease
# an understanding of the condition's natural history
# an understanding about who will be treated as a patient
# a NBS screening test that is reliable for both affected and unaffected patients and is acceptable to the public<ref name=screeningduchenne>{{pmid|16528755}}</ref>

As diagnostic techniques have progressed, debates have arisen as to how screening programs should adapt.  [[Tandem mass spectrometry]] has greatly expanded the potential number of diseases that can be detected, even without satisfying all of the other criteria used for making screening decisions.<ref name=screeningduchenne /><ref name=screeningopps>{{cite pmid|19412659}}</ref>  [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] is a disease that has been added to screening programs in several jurisdictions around the world, despite the lack of evidence as to whether early detection improves the clinical outcome for a patient.<ref name=screeningduchenne />

==Techniques==

===Sample collection===
Newborn screening tests are most commonly done from [[whole blood]] samples collected on specially designed filter paper.  The filter paper is often attached to a form containing required information about the infant and parents.  This includes date and time of birth, date and time of sample collection, the infant's weight and gestational age.  The form will also have information about whether the baby has had a blood transfusion and any additional nutrition the baby may have received ([[total parenteral nutrition]]).  Most newborn screening cards also include contact information for the infant's physician in cases where follow up screening or treatment is needed.  The Canadian province of [[Quebec]] performs newborn screening on whole blood samples collected as in most other jurisdictions, and also runs a voluntary [[urine]] screening program where parents collect a sample at 21 days of age and submit it to a provincial laboratory for an additional panel of conditions.<ref name=quebecblood>{{cite web|title=Newborn blood screening|url=http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/Portail/Citoyens/Evenements/DevenirParent/Pages/progr_depst_neont_sangn.aspx |publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref><ref name=quebecurine>{{cite web|title=Newborn urine screening|url=http://www4.gouv.qc.ca/EN/Portail/Citoyens/Evenements/DevenirParent/Pages/progr_depst_neont_urinr.aspx# |publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>  

Newborn screening samples are collected from the infant between 24 hours and 7 days after birth, with the requirement that the baby has fed at least once.  Samples can be collected at the hospital, or by [[midwife|midwives]].  If a sample is collected from an infant who is less than 24 hours old, the laboratory will often request a repeat specimen be taken after 24 hours.  Samples are mailed daily to the laboratory responsible for testing.  In the United States and Canada, newborn screening is mandatory, with an option for parents to opt out of the screening in writing if they desire.<ref name=mnoptout>{{cite web|title=Minnesota Newborn Screening Program Parental Options|url= http://www.health.state.mn.us/newbornscreening/optout.html |publisher=Minnesota Department of Health | accessdate=2012-08-12}}</ref><ref name=spotoftrouble>{{cite pmid|21753828
 }}</ref>  In most of Europe, newborn screening is done with the consent of the parents.  Proponents of mandatory screening claim that the test is for the benefit of the child, and that parents should not be able to opt out on their behalf.  In regions that favour informed consent for the procedure, they report no increase in costs, no decrease in the number of children screened and no cases of included diseases in children who did not undergo screening.<ref name=nbsreflections>{{cite pmid| 22186830}}</ref>

===Laboratory testing===
Because newborn screening programs test for a number of different conditions, a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used, as well as bedside testing for [[hearing loss]] using evoked auditory potentials<ref name="hearingreview">{{cite pmid|21698417}}</ref> and [[congenital heart defects]] using [[pulse oximetry]].<ref name=pulseoxreview>{{cite pmid|22554860}}</ref>  Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with [[phenylketonuria]] in the early 1960s.<ref name=pkureview>{{cite pmid|21555948}}</ref>  With this testing methodology, newborn screening required one test to detect one condition.  As [[mass spectrometry]] became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and [[amino acid]]s from a single dried blood spot.  This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening.  Enzyme assays are used to screen for [[galactosemia]] and [[biotinidase deficiency]].  Immunoassays measure [[thyroid hormones]] for the diagnosis of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] and [[17-hydroxyprogesterone]] for the diagnosis of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].  Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].

===Reporting results===
The goal is to report the results within a short period of time. If screens are normal, a paper report is sent to the submitting hospital and parents rarely hear about it.  If an abnormality is detected, employees of the agency, usually nurses, begin to try to reach the physician, hospital, and/or nursery by telephone. They are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician (depending on the disease). The specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the tests by a different method or laboratory, or by performing other corroboratory or disproving tests. The confirmatory test varies depending on the positive results on the initial screen. Confirmatory testing can include analyte specific assays to confirm any elevations detected, functional studies to determine enzyme activity, and genetic testing to identify disease-causing mutations.  In some cases, a positive newborn screen can also trigger testing on other family members, such as siblings who did not undergo newborn screening for the same condition or the baby's mother, as some maternal conditions can be identified through results on the baby's newborn screen.  Depending on the likelihood of the diagnosis and the risk of delay, the specialist will initiate treatment and provide information to the family. Performance of the program is reviewed regularly and strenuous efforts are made to maintain a system that catches every infant with these diagnoses.  Guidelines for newborn screening and follow up have been published by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]<ref>Newborn Screening Expands: Recommendations for Pediatricians and Medical Homes-Implications for the 
.  Pediatrics121:1 192-217 January 2008 [http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2007-3021]</ref> and the [[American College of Medical Genetics]].<ref name=acmgactsheets>{{cite web|title=ACMG NBS ACT Sheets|url= http://www.acmg.net/AM/Template.cfm?Section=NBS_ACT_Sheets_and_Algorithms_Table&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=7090|publisher=[[American College of Medical Genetics]]|accessdate=2012-08-12}}</ref>

==Targeted disorders==
{{see also|List of disorders included in newborn screening programs}}

Newborn screening is intended as a [[public health]] program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically, or suffer irreversible damage.  Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening, being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the [[United States]] and the rest of the world.<ref name=guthriebio>{{cite doi|10.1309/LMD48N6BNZSXIPVH}}</ref>  After the success of newborn screening for PKU (39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening, with no [[false negative]] results), Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants, eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify [[galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency|classic galactosemia]] and [[maple syrup urine disease]].<ref name=guthriebook>{{cite book|title=Robert Guthrie:  The PKU Story|publisher=Hope Publishing House|last=Koch|first=Jean|year=1997|isbn=0-932727-91-3|page=x}}</ref><ref name=guthriebio />    

Newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of PKU testing in the 1960s, but can vary greatly between countries.  In 2011, the United States screened for 54 conditions, Germany for 12, the United Kingdom for 2 (PKU and [[medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]] (MCADD)), while France and Hong Kong only screened for one condition (PKU and congenital hypothyroidism, respectively).<ref name=germanreview>{{cite pmid|21689452}}</ref>  The conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly, based on the legal requirements for screening programs, prevalence of certain diseases within a population, political pressure, and the availability of resources for both testing and follow-up of identified patients.

===Amino acid disorders===
Newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder, [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), which can be easily treated by dietary modifications, but causes severe [[mental retardation]] if not identified and treated early.  [[Robert Guthrie]] introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s.<ref name=pkureview />  With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident, and treatment initiated, screening was quickly adopted around the world.  Austria started screening for PKU in 1966<ref name=austriascreening>{{cite pmid|20938748}}</ref> and England in 1968.<ref name=englandscreening>{{cite pmid|497752}}</ref>

===Fatty acid oxidation disorders===
With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool, several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs.  [[Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]] (MCADD), which had been implicated in several cases of [[sudden infant death syndrome]]<ref name=mcadsids>{{cite pmid|18045290}}</ref><ref name=mcadsids2>{{cite pmid|15171999}}</ref><ref name=mcadsids3>{{cite pmid|7740006}}</ref> was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion.  MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only.<ref name=germanreview />  Population based studies in Germany, the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of [[fatty acid oxidation]] disorders at 1:9300 among Caucasians.  The United States screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders, either as primary or secondary targets, while other countries screen for a subset of these.<ref name=faoreview>{{cite pmid| 20373143}}</ref>

The introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions, particularly MCADD.  An Australian study found a 74% reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening.  Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically.<ref name=faoreview />

Newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions.  Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening, [[short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]] (SCADD) was thought to be life threatening.  Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were [[asymptomatic]], to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions.  Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening, this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified.<ref name=faoreview />

===Endocrinopathies===
The most commonly included disorders of the [[endocrine system]] are [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (CH) and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH).<ref name=endocrinopathies>{{cite pmid|19944295}}</ref>  Testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card.  Screening for CH is done by measuring [[thyroxin]] (T4), [[thyrotropin]] (TSH) or a combination of both analytes.  Elevated [[17-hydroxyprogesterone]] (17OHP) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH, most commonly done using [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays]], with many programs using a second tier [[tandem mass spectrometry]] test to reduce the number of [[false positive]] results.<ref name=endocrinopathies />  Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of [[congenital adrenal hypoplasia]], which presents with extremely low levels of 17OHP.<ref name=endocrinopathies />

CH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s, often as the second condition included after PKU.  The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the [[thyroid gland]]  After many years of newborn screening, the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1:3600 births, with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups.  Recent data from certain regions have showed an increase, with New York reporting an incidence of 1:1700.  Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied, but no explanation has been found.<ref name=endocrinopathies />

Classic CAH, the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[steroid 21-hydroxylase]], and comes in two forms - simple virilizing and a salt-wasting form.  Incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations.  The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska (1:280) and on the French island of [[La Reunion]] (1:2100).<ref name=endocrinopathies />

===Hemoglobinopathies===
[[File:Sickle cells.jpg|thumb|Sickle cells in human blood: both normal red blood cells and sickle-shaped cells are present]] 
Any condition that results in the production of abnormal [[hemoglobin]] is included under the broad category of [[hemoglobinopathies]].  Worldwide, it is estimated that 7% of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance.<ref name=hemoreview /> The most well known condition in this group is [[sickle cell disease]].<ref name=hemoreview>{{cite pmid|20207263}}</ref>  Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using [[isoelectric focusing]], which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins.<ref name=hemoreview />  In the United States, newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987, however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006.<ref name=hemoreview />  

Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion.  [[Penicillin]] has been used in children with sickle cell disease, and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe [[thalassemia]].<ref name=hemoreview />

===Organic acidemias===
Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the [[organic acidemia]]s before [[tandem mass spectrometry]] significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening.  Quebec has run a voluntary second-tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a [[thin layer chromatography]] method.<ref name=quebecurine />  Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias, including [[propionic acidemia]], [[methylmalonic acidemia]] and [[isovaleric acidemia]].

===Cystic fibrosis===
[[Cystic fibrosis]] (CF) was first added to newborn screening programs in [[New Zealand]] and regions of [[Australia]] in 1981, by measuring [[immunoreactive trypsinogen]] (IRT) in dried blood spots.<ref name=cfswiss>{{cite pmid|22300503}}</ref>  After the ''CFTR'' gene was identified, Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of [[false positives]].  Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers.<ref name=polandcf>{{cite pmid|22892530}}</ref>  CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states, Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010.<ref name=cfreviewus>{{cite pmid|22491493}}</ref>  Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2006.<ref name=albertacf>{{cite pmid|22043142}}</ref>  Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs.<ref name=canadacf>{{cite web|title=Cystic Fibrosis Canada Calls for CF Newborn Screening in Every Province—Early CF Detection Saves Lives|url=http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/en/news/20120726.php|publisher=Cystic Fibrosis Canada|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>  The [[United Kingdom]] as well as many [[European Union]] countries screen for CF as well.<ref name=canadacf />  Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu, doing so in January 2011.<ref name=cfswiss />

===Urea cycle disorders===
Disorders of the distal [[urea cycle]], such as [[citrullinemia]], [[argininosuccinic aciduria]] and [[argininemia]] are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids.  Proximal urea cycle defects, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency]] and [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency]] are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology, and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available. Some regions claim to screen for [[HHH syndrome]] (hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria) based on the detection of elevated [[ornithine]] levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot, but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth.<ref name=skhhh>{{cite pmid|20574716}}</ref>

===Lysosomal storage disorders===
Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency.  As a group, they are heterogenous, with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders.  The arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment (when treatment is available), avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child.<ref name=lsdreview>{{cite pmid| 20489136}}</ref>  The arguments against including these disorders, as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder, the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods, and the high cost / high risk associated with some treatment options.<ref name=lsdreview />  

New York State started a pilot study to screen for [[Krabbe disease]] in 2006, largely due to the efforts of [[Jim Kelly]], whose son, Hunter, was affected with the disease.<ref name=jimkelly>{{cite web|title=Jim Kelly and Hunter's Hope families push for universal newborn screening|url=http://news.wbfo.org/post/jim-kelly-and-hunters-hope-families-push-universal-newborn-screening|publisher=WBFO 88.7, Buffalo's NPR News Station|date=2011-07-28}last=Osorio|first=Sharon}}</ref>  A pilot screening program for four lysosomal storage diseases ([[Gaucher disease]], [[Pompe disease]], [[Fabry disease]] and [[Niemann-Pick disease]] was undertaken using anonymised dried blood spots was completed in Austria in 2010.  Their data showed an increased incidence from what was expected in the population, and also a number of late onset forms of disease, which are not typically the target for newborn screening programs.<ref name=austrialsd>{{cite pmid|22133539}}</ref>

===Hearing loss===
Undiagnosed [[hearing loss]] in a child can have serious effects on many developmental areas, including language, social interactions, emotions, cognitive ability, academic performance and vocational skills, any combination of which can have negative impacts on the quality of life.<ref name=hearingreview>{{cite pmid|21698417}}</ref>  The serious impacts of a late diagnosis, combined with the high incidence (estimated at 1 - 3 per 1000 live births, and as high as 4% for [[neonatal intensive care unit]] patients) have been the driving forces behind screening programs designed to identify infants with hearing loss as early as possible.  Early identification allows these patients and their families to access needed resources to help them develop.<ref name=hearingreview />

Newborn hearing testing is done at the bedside using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions, automated auditory brainstem responses or a combination of both techniques.  Hearing screening programs have found the initial testing to cost between $10.20 and $23.37 per baby, depending on the technology used.<ref name=hearingreview />  As these are screening tests only, [[false positive]] results will occur.  A review of hearing screening programs found varied initial referral rates (screen positive results) from 0.6% to 16.7%.  The highest overall incidence of hearing loss detection was 0.517%.<ref name=hearingreview />  A significant proportion of screen positive infants were [[lost to follow-up]], before a diagnosis could be confirmed or ruled out in all screening programs.<ref name=hearingreview />

===Congenital heart defects===
[[Pulse oximetry]] has been recently added as a bedside screening test for critical congenital heart defects.<ref name=pulseoxreview>{{cite pmid|22554860}}</ref>

===Severe combined immunodeficiency===
[[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID) caused by [[T-cell]] deficiency is a disorder that was recently added to newborn screening programs in some regions of the United States.  Wisconsin was the first state to add SCID to their mandatory screening panel in 2008, and it was recommended for inclusion in all states' panels in 2010. Identification of infants with SCID is done by detecting T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) using real-time quantitative [[polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-qPCR).  TRECs are decreased in infants affected with SCID.<ref name=scidreview>{{cite pmid|20864885}}</ref>

SCID has not been added to newborn screening in a wide scale for several reasons.  It requires technology that is not currently used in most newborn screening labs, as PCR is not used for any other assays included in screening programs.  Follow-up and treatment of affected infants also requires skilled [[immunologists]], which may not be available in all regions.  Treatment for SCID is a [[stem cell transplant]], which cannot be done in all centers.<ref name=scidreview />

===Other conditions===
[[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD) is an [[X-linked]] disorder caused by defective production of [[dystrophin]].  Many jurisdictions around the world have screened for, or attempted to screen for DMD using elevated levels of [[creatine kinase]] measured in dried blood spots.  Because universal newborn screening for DMD has not been undertaken, affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis.  As treatment options for DMD become more and more effective, interest in adding a newborn screening test increases.  At various times since 1978, DMD has been included (often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population) in newborn screening programs in [[Edinburgh]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Wales]], [[Cyprus]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United States]].  In 2012, Belgium was the only country that continued to screen for DMD using creatine kinase levels.<ref name=dmdnews>{{cite web|title=Newborn screening for DMD shows promise as an international model|url= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-03/nch-nsf031912.php|publisher=Nationwide Children's Hospital|accessdate=2012-08-24|date=2012-03-19}}</ref>

As treatments improve, newborn screening becomes a possibility for disorders that could benefit from early intervention, but none was previously available.  [[Adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD), a peroxisomal disease that has a variable clinical presentation is one of the disorders that has become a target for those seeking to identify patients early.  ALD can present in several different forms, some of which do not present until adulthood, making it a difficult choice for countries to add to screening programs.  The most successful treatment option is a [[stem cell transplant]], a procedure that carries a significant risk.<ref name=aldscreening>{{cite pmid|18078355}}</ref>

==Laboratory performance==
Newborn screening programs participate in [[quality control]] programs as in any other laboratory, with some notable exceptions.  Much of the success of newborn screening programs is dependent on the filter paper used for the collection of the samples.  Initial studies using Robert Guthrie's test for PKU reported high false positive rates that were attributed to a poorly selected type of filter paper.<ref name=qualitycontrol>{{cite pmid|20207262}}</ref>  This source of variation has been eliminated in most newborn screening programs through standardization of approved sources of filter paper for use in newborn screening programs.  In most regions, the newborn screening card (which contains demographic information as well as attached filter paper for blood collection) is supplied by the organization carrying out the testing, to remove variations from this source.<ref name=qualitycontrol />

==Controversies==
Newborn screening tests have become a subject of political controversy in the last decade. In 2003, two California babies, Zachary Wyvill and Zachary Black, were both born with Glutaric acidemia type I. Wyvill's birth hospital only tested for the four diseases mandated by state law, while Black was born at a hospital that was participating in an expanded testing pilot program. Black's disease was treated with diet and vitamins; Wyvill's disease went undetected for over six months, and during that time the damage from the enzyme deficiency became irreversible.<ref>http://online.wsj.com/ad/article/philips/SB108741631056839034.html</ref> Birth-defects lobbyists pushing for broader and more universal standards for newborn testing cite this as an example of how much of an impact testing can have.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Instituting MS/MS screening often requires a sizable up front expenditure.  When states choose to run their own programs the initial costs for equipment, training and new staff can be significant. Moreover, MS/MS gives only the screening result and not the confirmatory result. The same has to be further done by higher technologies or procedure like GC/MS, Enzyme Assays or DNA Tests. This in effect adds more cost burden and makes physicians lose precious time. To avoid at least a portion of the up front costs, some states such as [http://www.savebabies.org/states/mississippi.php Mississippi] have chosen to contract with private labs for expanded screening.  Others have chosen to form [http://www.umassmed.edu/nbs/ Regional Partnerships] sharing both costs and resources.

But for many states, screening is an integrated part of the department of health which can not or will not be easily replaced.  Thus the initial expenditures can be difficult for states with tight budgets to justify.  Screening fees have also increased in recent years as health care costs rise and as more states add MS/MS screening to their programs. [http://www2.uthscsa.edu/nnsis (See Report of Summation of Fees Charged for Newborn Screening, 2001–2005)] Dollars spent for these programs may reduce resources available to other potentially lifesaving programs.  It has been recommended that one disorder, Short Chain Acyl-coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency, or SCAD, be eliminated from screening programs, due to a "spurious association between SCAD and symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16926360 | doi=10.1001/jama.296.8.993 | volume=296 | issue=8 | title=Newborn screening for metabolic disorders | year=2006 | month=August | author=Waisbren SE | journal=JAMA | pages=993–5}}</ref>  However, recent studies suggest that expanded screening is cost effective (see [ftp://ftp.hrsa.gov/mchb/genetics/screeningdraftforcomment.pdf ACMG report page 94-95] and articles published in ''Pediatrics''<ref>Expanded Newborn Screening for Inborn Errors of Metabolism by Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Results, Outcome and Implication PMID 12777559 [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/111/6/1399]<</ref>'.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/110/4/781 | pmid = 12359795 | volume=110 | issue=4 | title=Cost-benefit analysis of universal tandem mass spectrometry for newborn screening | year=2002 | month=October | author=Schoen EJ, Baker JC, Colby CJ, To TT | journal=Pediatrics | pages=781–6}}</ref>  Advocates are quick to point out studies such as these when trying to convince state legislatures to mandate expanded screening.

Expanded newborn screening is also opposed by among some health care providers, who are concerned that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, that [[false positive]] screening tests may cause harm, and issues of [[informed consent]].<ref>[http://www.newbornscreening.info/felsi.html Financial, Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues]</ref> A recent study by [[Genetic Alliance]] and partners suggests that communication between health care providers and parents may be key in minimizing the potential harm when a false positive test occurs. The results from this study also reveal that parents found newborn screening to be a beneficial and necessary tool to prevent treatable diseases.<ref name="pmid22237434">{{cite journal

Controversy has also erupted in some countries over collection and storage of blood or DNA samples by government agencies during the routine newborn blood screen.  It was revealed that in Texas the state had collected and stored blood and DNA samples on millions of newborns without the parents' knowledge or consent.  These samples were then used by the state for genetic experiments and to set up a database to catalog all of the samples/newborns. Samples obtained without parents' consent were destroyed.<ref>[http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/texas/settlement-in-newborn-dna-lawsuit Newborn DNA samples to be destroyed]</ref>
