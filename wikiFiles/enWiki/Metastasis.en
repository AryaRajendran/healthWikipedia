'''Metastasis''', or '''metastatic disease''', is the spread of a [[cancer]] from one [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or part to another non-adjacent organ or part. The new occurrences of disease thus generated are referred to as metastases (sometimes abbreviated '''mets''')<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref>  In origin ''metastasis'' is a [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word meaning "displacement", from μετά, ''meta'', "next", and στάσις, ''stasis'', "placement". The plural is metastases.

[[Cancer]] occurs after a single cell in a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] is progressively genetically damaged to produce cells with uncontrolled proliferation. This uncontrolled proliferation, [[mitosis]], produces a [[primary tumor]]. The cells which constitute the tumour eventually undergo [[metaplasia]], followed by [[dysplasia]] then [[anaplasia]], resulting in a [[Malignancy|malignant]] phenotype. This malignant phenotype allows for [[intravasation]] into the circulation, followed by [[extravasation]] to a second site for [[tumorigenesis]]. 

Some cancer cells acquire the ability to penetrate the walls of [[lymphatic vessel|lymphatic]] and/or [[blood vessel]]s, after which they are able to circulate through the [[bloodstream]] ([[circulating tumor cell]]s) to other sites and tissues in the body. This process is known (respectively) as ''lymphatic'' or ''hematogeneous'' spread.

After the tumor cells come to rest at another site, they re-penetrate the vessel or walls and continue to multiply, eventually forming another clinically detectable tumor. This new tumor is known as a metastatic (or ''secondary'') tumor. Metastasis is one of three hallmarks of [[cancer|malignancy]] (contrast [[benign tumor]]s).<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book

When tumor cells metastasize, the new tumor is called a ''secondary'' or ''metastatic'' tumor, and its cells are similar to those in the original tumor. This means, for example, that, if [[breast cancer]] metastasizes to the lungs, the secondary tumor is made up of abnormal breast cells, not of abnormal lung cells. The tumor in the lung is then called ''metastatic breast cancer'', not ''lung cancer''.

== Signs and symptoms ==


Initially, nearby lymph nodes are struck early.<ref name=nci/> The [[lungs]], [[liver]], [[brain]], and [[bone]]s are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors.<ref name=nci/>

*In [[lymph nodes]], a common symptom is [[lymphadenopathy]]
*Lungs: [[cough]], [[hemoptysis]] and [[dyspnea]]<ref name=nci/> (shortness of breath)
*Liver: [[hepatomegaly]] (enlarged [[liver]]), [[nausea]]<ref name=nci/> and [[jaundice]]<ref name=nci/>
*Bones: bone pain,<ref name=nci>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/metastatic National Cancer Institute: Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers]. Retrieved on 2008-11-01</ref> [[fracture]] of affected bones<ref name=nci/>
*Brain: [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms such as headaches,<ref name=nci/> seizures,<ref name=nci/> and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].<ref name=nci/>

Although advanced cancer may cause [[pain]], it is often not the first symptom.

Some patients, however, don't show any symptoms.<ref name=nci/>
When the organ gets a metastatic disease it begins to shrink until its [[lymph nodes]] burst, or undergo [[lysis]].

== Pathophysiology ==
Metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer. The spread of metastasis may occur via the blood or the lymphatics or through both routes. The most common places for the metastases to occur are the [[lung]]s, [[liver]], [[brain]], and the [[bone]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/metastatic|title=Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=National Cancer Institute}}</ref>

=== Factors involved ===
Metastasis is a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, or by direct extension. To do so, malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade [[protein]]s that make up the surrounding [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM), which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues. By degrading these proteins, cancer cells are able to breach the ECM and escape. The location of the metastases isn't always random, with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone.<ref>Don X. Nguyen and Joan Massagué, Genetic determinants of cancer metastasis, Nature, 2007.  http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n5/pdf/nrg2101.pdf</ref> Breast cancer, for example, tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs. This specificity seems to be mediated by soluble signal molecules such as [[chemokines]]<ref>Zlotnik A., Burkhardt A. M., Homey B., Homeostatic chemokine receptors and organ-specific metastasis, Nature reviews, 2007</ref> and [[transforming growth factor beta]].<ref>Yvette Drabsch, Peter ten Dijke, TGF-β Signaling in Breast Cancer Cell Invasion and Bone Metastasis, J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia (2011) 16:97–108</ref> The body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as [[metastasis suppressor]]s, of which about a dozen are known.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yoshida BA, Sokoloff MM, Welch DR, Rinker-Schaeffer CW |title=Metastasis-suppressor genes: a review and perspective on an emerging field |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |volume=92 |issue=21 |pages=1717–30 |year=2000 |month=Nov |pmid=11058615 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/92.21.1717|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/92/21/1717}}</ref>

Human cells exhibit 3 kinds of motion: collective [[motility]], mesenchymal-type movement, and [[amoeboid movement]]. Cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion. Some cancer researchers hope to find treatments that can stop or at least slow down the spread of cancer by somehow blocking some necessary step in one or the other or both kinds of motion.<ref>

Cancer researchers studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the growth of a new network of blood vessels, called tumor [[angiogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weidner N, Semple JP, Welch WR, Folkman J |title=Tumor angiogenesis and metastasis—correlation in invasive breast carcinoma |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=324 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=1991 |month=Jan |pmid=1701519 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199101033240101|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/1/1}}</ref> It has been found that [[angiogenesis inhibitor]]s would therefore prevent the growth of metastases.<ref name = "Robbins"/>

There are several different cell types critical to tumor growth. In particular [[endothelial progenitor cell]]s are a very important cell population in tumor blood vessel growth. This finding was published in the journals Science (2008) and Genes and Development (2007) together with the fact that endothelial progenitor cells are critical for metastasis and angiogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gao D et al.| title = Endothelial Progenitor Cells Control the Angiogenic Switch in Mouse Lung Metastasis| journal = Science | volume = 319 | pages = 195–198 | year = 2008| doi = 10.1126/science.1150224 | pmid = 18187653 | issue = 5860 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Nolan DJ et al.| title = Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are a major determinant of nascent tumor neovascularization| journal = Genes & Development | volume = 21 | pages = 1546–1558 | year = 2007| doi = 10.1101/gad.436307 | pmid = 17575055 | issue = 12 | pmc = 1891431  }}</ref> The importance of endothelial progenitor cells in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis has been confirmed by a recent publication in Cancer Research (August 2010).

This novel finding meant that investigators were able to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor vasculature. This finding of endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature proves the importance of this cell type in blood vessel development in a tumor setting and metastasis. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and vasculature development. Therefore endothelial progenitor cells are very important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mellick As, Plummer PN et al.| title = Using the Transcription Factor Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 to Selectively Target Endothelial Progenitor Cells Offers Novel Strategies to Inhibit Tumor Angiogenesis and Growth| journal = Cancer Research | volume = 70 | pages = 7273–7282 | year = 2010| doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1142 | pmid = 20807818 | issue = 18 | pmc=3058751}}</ref>

=== Routes of metastasis ===
[[File:Metastasis sites for common cancers.svg|thumb|240px|Main sites of metastases for some common cancer types. Primary cancers are denoted by "''...cancer''" and their main metastasis sites are denoted by "''...metastases''".<ref>List of included entries and references is found on main image page in Commons: [[Commons:File:Metastasis sites for common cancers.svg#Summary]]</ref>]]
Metastasis occurs by following four routes:

====1. Transcoelomic====

The spread of a malignancy into body cavities can occur via seeding the surface of the [[peritoneal cavity|peritoneal]], [[pleural cavity|pleural]], pericardial, or subarachnoid spaces. For example, [[ovarian cancer|ovarian tumors]] can spread transperitoneally to the surface of the liver.  [[Mesothelioma]] and primary [[lung cancer]]s can spread through the [[pleural]] cavity, often causing malignant [[pleural effusion]].<ref name="transcoelomic">

 |pages=221–47
}}</ref>

====2. Lymphatic spread====

Invasion into the lymphatic system allows the transport of tumor cells to regional and distant lymph nodes and, ultimately, to other parts of the body. This is the most common route of metastasis for [[carcinoma]]s. In contrast, it is uncommon for a [[sarcoma]] to metastasize via this route.

[[File:Lymph node with metastatic melanoma.jpg|thumb|Lymph node with almost complete replacement by metastatic melanoma. The brown pigment is focal deposition of melanin]]

====3. Haematogenous spread====

This is typical route of metastasis for sarcomas, but it is also the favored route for certain types of carcinoma, such as those originating in the kidney (renal cell carcinoma). Because of their thinner walls, veins are more frequently invaded than are arteries, and metastasis tends to follow the pattern of venous flow.

====4. Transplantation or implantation====

Mechanical carriage of fragments of tumor cells by surgical instruments during operation or the use of needles during diagnostic procedures.

Cancer cells may spread to [[lymph node]]s (regional lymph nodes) near the primary tumor. This is called nodal involvement, positive nodes, or regional disease. ("Positive nodes" is a term that would be used by medical specialists to describe a patient's condition, meaning that the patient's lymph nodes near the primary tumor tested positive for malignancy. It is common medical practice to test by biopsy at least two lymph nodes near a tumor site when doing surgery to examine or remove a tumor.) Localized spread to regional [[lymph node]]s near the primary tumor is not normally counted as metastasis, although this is a sign of worse [[prognosis]]. Transport through lymphatics is the most common pathway for the initial dissemination of carcinomas.<ref name="Robbins"/>

===Organ-specific targets===
There is a propensity for certain tumors to seed in particular organs. This was first discussed as the "seed and soil" theory by [[Stephen Paget]] over a century ago in 1889. The propensity for a metastatic cell to spread to a particular organ is termed 'organotropism'. For example, [[prostate cancer]] usually metastasizes to the bones. In a similar manner, [[colon cancer]] has a tendency to metastasize to the liver. [[Stomach cancer]] often metastasises to the [[ovary]] in women, then it is called a [[Krukenberg tumor]]. 

According to the "seed and soil" theory, it is difficult for cancer cells to survive outside their region of origin, so in order to metastasize they must find a location with similar characteristics.<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/v8wt2q033u674121/</ref> For example, breast tumor cells, which gather calcium [[ion]]s from breast milk, metastasize to bone tissue, where they can gather calcium ions from bone. Malignant [[melanoma]] spreads to the brain, presumably because [[neural]] tissue and [[melanocyte]]s arise from the same [[cell line]] in the [[embryo]].<ref>Robert Weinberg, The Biology of Cancer, cited in [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/health/03angi.html Basics: A mutinous group of cells on a greedy, destructive task], by Natalie Angier, New York Times, 3 April 2007</ref>

In 1928 [[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]] challenged the "seed and soil" theory and proposed that metastasis occurs purely by anatomic and mechanical routes.

=== Metastasis and primary cancer ===
It is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer, and, as such, is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body. However, over 10% of patients presenting to [[oncology unit]]s will have metastases without a primary tumor found. In these cases, doctors refer to the primary tumor as "unknown" or "occult," and the patient is said to have [[cancer of unknown primary origin]] (CUP) or [[unknown primary tumors]] (UPT). It is estimated that 3% of all cancers are of unknown primary origin.<ref name="CUP-Oncologist">{{cite journal |author=Briasoulis E, Pavlidis N |title=Cancer of Unknown Primary Origin |journal=Oncologist |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=142–152 |year=1997 |pmid=10388044 |doi= |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10388044}}</ref> Studies have shown that, if simple questioning does not reveal the cancer's source (coughing up blood—"probably [[lung cancer|lung]]", urinating blood—"probably [[bladder cancer|bladder]]"), complex imaging will not either.<ref name="CUP-Oncologist"/> In some of these cases a primary tumor may appear later.

The use of [[immunohistochemistry]] has permitted pathologists to give an identity to many of these metastases. However, imaging of the indicated area only occasionally reveals a primary.  In rare cases (e.g., of [[melanoma]]), no primary tumor is found, even on [[autopsy]]. It is therefore thought that some primary tumors can regress completely, but leave their metastases behind.

=== Common sites of origin ===

== Diagnosis==
The cells in a metastatic tumor resemble those in the primary tumor. Once the cancerous tissue is examined under a microscope to determine the cell type, a doctor can usually tell whether that type of cell is normally found in the part of the body from which the tissue sample was taken.

For instance, [[breast cancer]] cells look the same whether they are found in the breast or have spread to another part of the body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as [[immunohistochemistry]], FISH ([[fluorescent in situ hybridization]]), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.

Metastatic cancers may be found at the same time as the primary tumor, or months or years later. When a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past, it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor.

It was previously thought that most cancer cells have a low metastatic potential and that there are rare cells that develop the ability to metastasize through the development of somatic mutations.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[somatic]] mutation theory of metastasis development has not been substantiated in human cancers.  Rather, it seems that the genetic state of the primary tumor reflects the ability of that cancer to metastasize.<ref name=signature />  Research comparing gene expression between primary and metastatic [[adenocarcinomas]] identified a subset of genes whose expression could distinguish primary tumors from metastatic tumors, dubbed a "metastatic signature."<ref name=signature />  Up-regulated genes in the signature include:  [[SNRPF]], [[HNRPAB]], [[DHPS]] and [[securin]].  [[Actin]], [[myosin]] and [[MHC class II]] down-regulation was also associated with the signature.  Additionally, the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors, indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor.<ref>{{cite journal

Expression of this metastatic signature has been correlated with a poor prognosis and has been shown to be consistent in several types of cancer.  Prognosis was shown to be worse for individuals whose primary tumors expressed the metastatic signature.<ref name=signature />  Additionally, the expression of these metastatic-associated genes was shown to apply to other cancer types in addition to [[adenocarcinoma]].  Metastases of [[breast cancer]], [[medulloblastoma]] and [[prostate cancer]] all had similar expression patterns of these metastasis-associated genes.<ref name=signature />

The identification of this metastasis-associated signature provides promise for identifying cells with metastatic potential within the primary tumor and hope for improving the prognosis of these metastatic-associated cancers.  Additionally, by identifying the genes whose expression is changed in metastasis offers potential targets to inhibit metastasis.<ref name=signature />

== Management ==
Treatment and survival is determined, to a great extent, by whether or not a cancer remains localized or spreads to other locations in the body. If the cancer metastasizes to other tissues or organs, it usually dramatically decreases a patient's likelihood of survival (i.e. the "prognosis"). However, there are some cancers - such as some forms of [[leukemia]], a cancer of the blood, or malignancies in the brain - that can kill without spreading at all.

Once a cancer has metastasized, it may still be treated with [[radiosurgery]], [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[biological therapy]], [[hormone therapy]], [[surgery]], or a combination of these interventions ("multimodal therapy"). The choice of treatment depends on a large number of factors, including the type of primary [[cancer]], the size and location of the metastases, the patient's age and general health, and the types of treatments used previously, among others. In patients diagnosed with CUP, it is often still possible to treat the disease even when the primary tumor cannot be located.

The treatment options currently available are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer, though some tumors, such as [[testicular cancer]] and [[thyroid cancer]], are usually still curable.
