In the context of [[surgery]] or [[dental surgery]], a '''gag''' is a device used to hold the [[patient]]'s [[mouth]] open when working in the [[oral cavity]], or to force the mouth open when it cannot open naturally because of forward [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the jaw joint's intraarticular cartilage pad. Applications for medical gags include [[oral surgery]] and [[airway management]]. Gag designs, like other medical instrument designs, are often named after their inventors. Common examples of medical gags include the '''Jennings''', '''Whitehead''', and '''Hallam''' gags.

*The Whitehead gag --invented in 1877 by [[Walter Whitehead]] (1840-1913), a surgeon in [[Manchester]], [[England]][http://www.adair.at/eng/museum/equipment/mouthgags/whitehead.htm]-- consists of two hinged metal frames that wrap around the front of the patient's head and which have sections bent to fit between the front teeth. When spread apart, the frames separate the jaws, holding the mouth open. The desired degree of separation is set and maintained by a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] mechanism on each side of the frame.
*In Jennings gags --which are very similar in other respects-- there is a ratchet on only one side.

==Non-medical uses==
These type of gags are also used in sexual [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] or [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] play.  See [[Gag (BDSM)#Medical]].
