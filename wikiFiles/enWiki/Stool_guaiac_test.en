The '''stool guaiac test''' or '''guaiac fecal occult blood test''' (gFOBT) is one of several methods that detect the presence of [[fecal occult blood]] (FOB)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/oivd/guidance/772.html#5a | title = Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff — Review Criteria for Assessment of Qualitative Fecal Occult Blood In Vitro Diagnostic Devices | date = August 8, 2007 | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety}}</ref> which is [[blood]] in the [[feces]] that cannot be seen.<ref>FDA website publication. Fecal occult blood.  Accessioned 2010 October 26 at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/HomeUseTests/ucm125834.htm</ref> 

The term '''guaiac''' denotes the name of the paper surface used in the test which has a phenolic compound, alpha-guaiaconic acid, that is extracted from the wood [[resin]] of [[Guaiacum]] trees.

==Methodology==

The stool guaiac test involves fasting from iron supplements, red meat (the blood it contains can turn the test positive), certain vegetables (which contain a chemical with peroxidase properties that can turn the test positive), and vitamin C and citrus fruits (which can turn the test falsely negative) for a period of time before the test. It has been suggested that cucumber, cauliflower and horseradish, and often other vegetables, should be avoided for three days before the test.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beg M, ''et al.'' |title=Occult Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Detection, Interpretation, and Evaluation |journal=JIACM |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=153–8 |year=2002 |format=PDF |url=http://medind.nic.in/jac/t02/i2/jact02i2p153.pdf}}</ref>

In testing, [[feces]] are applied to a thick piece of paper attached to a thin film coated with guaiac.  Either the patient or medical professional smears a small fecal sample on to the film.  The fecal sample is obtained by catching the stool and transferring a sample with an applicator.  Digital rectal examination specimens are also used but this method is discouraged for colorectal cancer screening due to very poor performance characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.vaoutcomes.org/papers/DRE_CSP_final.pdf}}</ref> 

Both sides of the test card can be peeled open, to access the inner guaiac paper.  One side of the card is marked for application of the stool and the other is for the developer fluid. 

After applying the feces, one or two drops of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are then dripped on to the other side of the film, and it is observed for a rapid blue color change.  

When the hydrogen peroxide is dripped on to the guaiac paper, it oxidizes the alpha-guaiaconic acid to a blue colored [[quinone]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kratochvil JF, ''et al.'' |title=Isolation and characterization of alpha-guaiaconic acid and the nature of guiacum blue |journal=Phytochem |volume=10 |pages=2529 |year=1971 }}</ref><ref>Guthlein W, Wielinger H, Rittersdorf W, Werner W. Guaiaconic acid A from guaiac resin, US Patent 4297271 PDF version at http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4297271.html</ref> Normally, when no blood and no peroxidases or catalases from vegetables are present, this oxidation occurs very slowly.  Heme, a component of hemoglobin found in blood, catalyzes this reaction, giving a result in about two seconds.  Therefore, a positive test result is one where there is a quick and intense blue color change of the film.

==Analytical interpretation==
The guaiac test can often be [[Type I and type II errors|false-positive]] which is a positive test result when there is in fact no source of bleeding. This is particularly common if the recommended dietary preparation is not followed, as the heme in red meat or the peroxidase or catalase activity in vegetables, especially if uncooked, can cause analytical false positives.  

[[Vitamin C]] can cause analytical [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]]s due to its anti-oxidant properties inhibiting the color reaction.<ref name="pmid1200528">{{cite journal |author=Jaffe RM, Kasten B, Young DS, MacLowry JD |title=False-negative stool occult blood tests caused by ingestion of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) |journal=Ann.

==Clinical application==
The article [[fecal occult blood]] (FOB) provides an expanded consideration of the clinical application of FOB tests generally, including other clinical methods, and the comments here are those that relate specifically to the guaiac gFOBT method.

One major use of stool testing for blood is detection of [[colorectal cancer]]. However, other possible positive results include: gastroesophageal cancer, GI bleeds, [[diverticulae]], [[hemorrhoids]], [[anal fissures]], [[colon polyps]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[celiac disease]], [[GERD]], [[esophagitis]], [[peptic ulcers]], [[gastritis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[vascular ectasias]], [[portal hypertensive gastropathy]], [[aortoenteric fistulas]], [[hemobilia]], [[endometriosis]], and [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]].

The stool guaiac test was originally the principal colon cancer screening technology available, but modern tests which look for [[globin]] or DNA are now also available.  Several recent colon cancer screening guidelines have recommended replacing any older low-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) with either newer high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), which tests for [[globin]] rather than the [[heme]] detected by the guaiac method. The US Multisociety Task Force (MSTF) looked at 6 studies that compared high sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA) to FIT, and  concluded that there were no clear difference in overall performance between these methods,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levin B, Lieberman DA, McFarland B, ''et al.'' |title=Screening and surveillance for the early detection of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps, 2008: a joint guideline from the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=1570–95 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18384785 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.02.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016-5085(08)00232-1}} Also published as ''CA Cancer J Clin''. 2008 May-Jun;'''58'''(3):130–60 {{doi|10.3322/CA.2007.0018}}  PMID 18322143</ref> and a similar recommendation was made by the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC).<ref>National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), a U.S. government-provided resource for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, at http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=14345</ref>
