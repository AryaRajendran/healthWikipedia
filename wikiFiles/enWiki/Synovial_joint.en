A '''synovial joint''', also known as a '''diarthrosis''', is the most common and most movable type of [[joint]] in the body of a mammal. As with most other joints, synovial joints achieve movement at the point of contact of the articulating [[bone]]s. 

Structural and functional differences distinguish synovial joints from [[cartilaginous joint]]s ([[synchondroses]] and [[symphyses]]) and [[fibrous joint]]s ([[Suture (anatomy)|sutures]], [[gomphoses]], and [[syndesmoses]]). The main structural differences between synovial and fibrous joints are the existence of capsules surrounding the articulating surfaces of a synovial joint and the presence of lubricating synovial fluid within those capsules (synovial cavities).

== Structure ==
Synovial joints contain the following structures:
* [[Synovial cavity]]: all diarthroses have this characteristic space between the bones that is filled with [[synovial fluid]]
* [[Articular capsule]]: the fibrous capsule, continuous with the periosteum of articulating bones, surrounds the diarthrosis and unites the articulating bones; the articular capsule consists of two layers - (1) the outer fibrous membrane that may contain ligaments and (2) the inner [[synovial membrane]] that secretes the lubricating, shock absorbing, and joint-nourishing synovial fluid; the articular capsule is highly innervated, but avascular (lacking blood and lymph vessels), and receives nutrition from the surrounding blood supply via either diffusion (a slow process) or by [[convection]], a far more efficient process achieved through exercise
* [[Articular cartilage]]: the bones of a synovial joint are covered by this layer of [[hyaline cartilage]] that lines the epiphyses of joint end of bone with a smooth, slippery surface that does not bind them together; articular cartilage functions to absorb shock and reduce friction during movement

Many, but not all, synovial joints also contain additional structures:<ref name="Drake2009p21"/>
* [[Articular discs]] or menisci - the [[fibrocartilage]] pads between opposing surfaces in a joint
* Articular fat pads - [[adipose tissue]] pads that protect the articular cartilage, as seen in the infrapatellar fat pad in the knee
* [[Tendons]]<ref name="Drake2009p21"/> - cords of dense [[regular connective tissue]] composed of parallel bundles of [[collagen fibers]]
* Accessory ligaments (extracapsular and intracapsular) - the fibers of some fibrous membranes are arranged in parallel bundles of dense [[regular connective tissue]] that are highly adapted for resisting strains to prevent extreme movements that may damage the articulation{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* [[Bursae]] - saclike structures that are situated strategically to alleviate friction in some joints (shoulder and knee) that are filled with fluid that is similar to synovial fluid<ref name="Tortora12thEd"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The bone surrounding the joint on the proximal side is sometimes called the ''plafond'', especially in the [[talocrural joint]]. A damage to this occurs in a [[Gosselin fracture]].

==Blood supply==
The blood supply of a synovial joint is derived from the arteries sharing in the [[anastomosis]] around the joint.

== Movements possible ==
The movements possible with synovial joints are:
* [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]]: movement away from the mid-line of the body
* [[adduction]]: movement toward the mid-line of the body
* [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]]: straightening limbs at a joint
* [[flexion]]: bending the limbs at a joint
* [[rotation]]: a circular movement around a fixed point

== Types ==
There are six types of synovial joints.<ref name="umich2010couse"/> Some are relatively immobile, but are more stable. Others have multiple degrees of freedom, but at the expense of greater risk of injury.<ref name="umich2010couse"/> In ascending order of mobility, they are:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Example
! Description
|- 
| [[Gliding joint]]s (or planar joints) 
| [[carpal]]s of the [[wrist]], [[acromioclavicular joint]]
| These joints allow only gliding or sliding movements
|- 
| [[Hinge joint]]s
| [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] (between the [[humerus]] and the [[ulna]])
| These joints act as a [[door]] [[hinge]] does, allowing flexion and extension in just one plane
|-
| [[Pivot joint]]s
| [[atlanto-axial joint]], [[proximal radioulnar joint]], and [[distal radioulnar joint]]
| One bone rotates about another
|- 
| [[Condyloid joint]]s (or [[ellipsoidal joint]]s)
| [[wrist joint]] ([[radiocarpal joint]]) temporomandibular joint
| A condyloid joint is where two bones fit together with an odd{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} shape (e.g. an [[ellipse]]), and one bone is concave, the other convex; some classifications make a distinction between condyloid and ellipsoid joints;<ref name="Rogers2010p157"/><ref name="Sharkey2008p33"/> these joints allow flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction movements (circumduction).  
|- 
| [[Saddle joint]]s
| [[Carpometacarpal]] or trapeziometacarpal joint of [[thumb]] (between the [[metacarpal]] and [[carpal]] - [[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]]), [[sternoclavicular joint]]
| Saddle joints, which resemble a [[horse tack|saddle]], permit the same movements as the condyloid joints
|- 
| [[Ball and socket joint]]s
"universal Joint"
| [[shoulder]] ([[glenohumeral]]) and [[hip]] joints
| These allow for all movements except gliding
|- 
| Compound joints<ref name="Moini2011p231"/><ref name="Abernethy2005p331"/> / modified hinge joints{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
| [[knee]] joint
| condylar joint (condyles of femur join with condyles of tibia) and saddle joint (lower end of femur joins with patella)
|}

== Factors influencing joint stability==
* The shape of articular surfaces
* Capsule and ligaments
* Muscle tone
* Gravity
* [[Atmospheric pressure]]
