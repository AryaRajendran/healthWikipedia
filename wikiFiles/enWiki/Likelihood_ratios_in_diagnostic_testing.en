{{Distinguish|Likelihood-ratio test}}

In [[evidence-based medicine]], '''likelihood ratios''' are used for assessing the value of performing a diagnostic test. They use the [[sensitivity and specificity]] of the test to determine whether a test result usefully changes the probability that a condition (such as a disease state) exists.

==Calculation==

Two versions of the likelihood ratio exist, one for positive and one for negative test results. 
Respectively, they are known as the ''likelihood ratio positive'' (LR+) and ''likelihood ratio negative'' (LR–).  

The likelihood ratio positive is calculated as

:<math> LR+ = \frac{\text{sensitivity}}{1 - \text{specificity}} </math>

which is equivalent to

:<math> LR+ = \frac{\Pr({T+}|D+)}{\Pr({T+}|D-)} </math>

or "the probability of a person who has the disease testing positive divided by the probability of a person who does not have the disease testing positive."
Here "T+" or "T&minus;" denote that the result of the test is positive or negative, respectively. Likewise, "D+" or "D&minus;" denote that the disease is present or absent, respectively. So "true positives" are those that test positive (T+) and have the disease (D+), and "false positives" are those that test positive (T+) but do not have the disease (D&minus;).

The likelihood ratio negative is calculated as<ref name=altman>{{cite book |author=Gardner, M.; Altman, Douglas G. |title=Statistics with confidence: confidence intervals and statistical guidelines |publisher=BMJ Books |location=London |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-7279-1375-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

which is equivalent to<ref name=altman/>

:<math> LR- = \frac{\Pr({T-}|D+)}{\Pr({T-}|D-)} </math>

or "the probability of a person who has the disease testing negative divided by the probability of a person who does not have the disease testing negative."  

The [[pretest odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[post-test odds]]. This calculation is based on [[Bayes' theorem]].  (Note that odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, [[probability]].)

==Application to medicine==
A likelihood ratio of greater than 1 indicates the test result is associated with the disease. A likelihood ratio less than 1 indicates that the result is associated with absence of the disease.
Tests where the likelihood ratios lie close to 1 have little practical significance as the post-test probability (odds) is little different from the pre-test probability, and as such is used primarily for diagnostic purposes, and not screening purposes. When the positive likelihood ratio is greater than 5 {{why|date=April 2013}} or the negative likelihood ratio is less than 0.2 (i.e.&nbsp;1/5) then they can be applied to the pre-test probability of a patient having the disease tested for to estimate a post-test probability of the disease state existing.<ref>Beardsell A, Bell S, Robinson S, Rumbold H. MCEM Part A:MCQs, Royal Society of Medicine Press 2009</ref>  In summary, the pre-test probability refers to the chance that an individual has a disorder or condition prior to the use of a diagnostic test. It allows the clinician to better interpret the results of the diagnostic test and helps to predict the likelihood of a true positive (T+) result.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.247.18.2543 | author = Harrell F, Califf R, Pryor D, Lee K, Rosati R | year = 1982 | title = Evaluating the Yield of Medical Tests | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 247 | issue = 18| pages = 2543–2546 | pmid = 7069920 }}</ref>

==Example==

A medical example is the likelihood that a given test result would be expected in a patient with a certain disorder compared to the likelihood that same result would occur in a patient without the target disorder.

Some sources distinguish between LR+ and LR&minus;.<ref name="urlLikelihood ratios">{{cite web |url=http://www.poems.msu.edu/InfoMastery/Diagnosis/likelihood_ratios.htm |title=Likelihood ratios |work= |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> A worked example is shown below.

[[Confidence intervals]] for all the predictive parameters involved can be calculated, giving the range of values within which the true value lies at a given confidence  level (eg 95%).<ref>[http://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php Online calculator of confidence intervals for predictive parameters]</ref>

==Estimation of pre- and post-test probability==
{{Further|Pre- and post-test probability}}
The likelihood ratio of a test provides a way to estimate the [[pre- and post-test probabilities]] of having a condition.

With ''pre-test probability'' and ''likelihood ratio'' given, then, the ''post-test probabilities'' can be calculated by the following three steps:<ref>[http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1043 Likelihood Ratios], from CEBM (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine). Page last edited: 01 February 2009</ref>

*Pretest odds = (Pretest probability / (1 - Pretest probability)
*Posttest odds = Pretest odds * Likelihood ratio
In equation above, ''positive post-test probability'' is calculated using the ''likelihood ratio positive'', and the ''negative post-test probability'' is calculated using the ''likelihood ratio negative''.

*Posttest probability = Posttest odds / (Posttest odds + 1)

In fact, ''post-test probability'', as estimated from the ''likelihood ratio'' and ''pre-test probability'', is generally more accurate than if estimated from the ''positive predictive value'' of the test, if the tested individual has a different ''pre-test probability'' than what is the ''prevalence'' of that condition in the population.

===Example===
Taking the medical example from above (20 true positives, 10 false negatives, and 2030 total patients), the ''positive pre-test probability'' is calculated as:

*Pretest probability = (20 + 10) / 2030 = 0.0148
*Pretest odds = 0.0148 / (1 - 0.0148) =0.015
*Posttest odds = 0.015 * 7.4 = 0.111
*Posttest probability = 0.111 / (0.111 + 1) =0.1 or 10%

As demonstrated, the ''positive post-test probability'' is numerically equal to the ''positive predictive value''; the ''negative post-test probability'' is numerically equal to (1 - ''negative predictive value'').
