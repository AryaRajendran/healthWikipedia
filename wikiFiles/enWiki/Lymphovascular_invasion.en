'''Lymphovascular invasion''' ('''LVI''' or '''lymphovascular space invasion''') is spread of a [[cancer]] to the [[blood vessel]]s and/or [[lymphatic system|lymphatics]].  

==Terminology==
Lymphovascular invasion may be used interchangeably with '''vascular invasion''', which strictly speaking is ''not'' [[synonymous]].  The term ''lymphovascular invasion'' is generally preferred to ''vascular invasion'' as it is difficult to differentiate small lymphatic spaces from small vascular spaces under the microscope without special techniques.

==Pathology==
Lymphovascular invasion, especially in [[carcinoma]]s, usually precedes spread to the lymph nodes that drain the tissue in which the tumour arose.  Conversely, cancers with lymph node spread (known as a [[lymph node metastases]]), usually have lymphovascular invasion.  Lymph node metastases usually precede secondary tumours, i.e. distant [[Metastasis|metastases]].

The absence of LVI in the context of proven lymph node metastasis is usually thought to be due to [[sampling error]].<ref name=pmid21545433>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Han | first1 = JS. | last2 = Molberg | first2 = KH. | last3 = Sarode | first3 = V. | title = Predictors of invasion and axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with a core biopsy diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ: an analysis of 255 cases. | journal = Breast J | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–9 | month =  | year =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4741.2011.01069.x | PMID = 21545433 }}</ref>

==Prognostic significance==
The predictive value and prevalence of lymphovascular invasion is strongly dependent on the type of cancer.  In other words, LVI in one type of cancer may be much less important than LVI in another type of cancer. 

Generally speaking, it is associated with lymph node metastases<ref name=pmid15273556>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schoppmann | first1 = SF. | last2 = Bayer | first2 = G. | last3 = Aumayr | first3 = K. | last4 = Taucher | first4 = S. | last5 = Geleff | first5 = S. | last6 = Rudas | first6 = M. | last7 = Kubista | first7 = E. | last8 = Hausmaninger | first8 = H. | last9 = Samonigg | first9 = H. | title = Prognostic value of lymphangiogenesis and lymphovascular invasion in invasive breast cancer. | journal = Ann Surg | volume = 240 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–12 | month = Aug | year = 2004 | PMID = 15273556 }}</ref><ref name=pmid16334758>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fang | first1 = WL. | last2 = Chang | first2 = SC. | last3 = Lin | first3 = JK. | last4 = Wang | first4 = HS. | last5 = Yang | first5 = SH. | last6 = Jiang | first6 = JK. | last7 = Chen | first7 = WC. | last8 = Lin | first8 = TC. | title = Metastatic potential in T1 and T2 colorectal cancer. | journal = Hepatogastroenterology | volume = 52 | issue = 66 | pages = 1688–91 | month =  | year =  | doi =  | PMID = 16334758 }}</ref> which themselves are predictive of a poorer [[prognosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Moreira | first1 = LF. | last2 = Kenmotsu | first2 = M. | last3 = Gochi | first3 = A. | last4 = Tanaka | first4 = N. | last5 = Orita | first5 = K. | title = Lymphovascular and neural invasion in low-lying rectal carcinoma. | journal = Cancer Detect Prev | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–8 | month =  | year = 1999  | PMID = 10101593 }}</ref> In the context of ([[histology|histologically]]) proven lymph node metastases, LVI may have less prognostic significance or no prognostic significance.
