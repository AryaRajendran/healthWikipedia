'''Forced diuresis''' (increased [[urine]] formation by [[diuretics]] and fluid) may enhance the excretion of certain drugs in urine and is used to treat [[drug overdose]] or [[poison]]ing of these drugs and [[hemorrhagic cystitis]].<ref>Chemotherapy and biotherapy guidelines and recommendations for practice.

==Diuretics==
{{Main|Diuretic}}
Most of the drugs are either [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s. When urine is made [[alkaline]], elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs.

This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH  of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the [[acid dissociation constant|pK]] value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the [[acid dissociation constant|pK]] value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross [[plasma membrane]] so cannot re-enter blood from [[kidney tubules]]. This method is ineffective for drugs which are strongly protein bound (e.g. [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s) or which have a large apparent [[volume of distribution]] (e.g. [[paracetamol]], tricyclic antidepressants).<ref>[http://www.aic.cuhk.edu.hk/web8/poisoning.htm Overdose<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Forced alkaline diuresis has been used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like [[salicylates]] and [[phenobarbitone]], while forced acid diuresis has been used to enhance the elimination of [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[quinine]], [[quinidine]], and [[strychnine]] when poisoning by these drugs has occurred.

For forced alkaline diuresis, a [[diuretic]] like [[furosemide]] is given intravenously and [[sodium bicarbonate]] is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then [[hypokalemia]] occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with alkalinization of the urine.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic207.htm eMedicine - Toxicity, Barbiturate : Article by Rania Habal, MD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

For forced acid diuresis, [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) is used. [[Ammonium chloride]] has also been used for forced acid diuresis but it is a [[toxic]] compound.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Usually however, this technique only produces a slight increase  in the [[renal clearance]] of the drug. Forced acid diuresis is rarely done in practice.<ref>http://jack119.org/myxoops/jackdownloads/toxbook_singapore.pdf</ref>

Forced alkaline diuresis is also recommended for [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref>[http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&doc_id=7387&nbr=4368 NGC - NGC Summary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
