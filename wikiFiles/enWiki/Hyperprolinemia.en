'''Hyperprolinemia''', also referred to as '''prolinemia''' or '''prolinuria''', is a condition which occurs when the [[amino acid]] [[proline]] is not broken down properly by the enzymes [[proline oxidase]] or pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogense, causing a build up of proline in the body. 

==Types==
===Hyperprolinemia type I=== 

It is difficult to determine the prevalence of hyperprolinemia type I, as many people with the condition are [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="ghr">http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=hyperprolinemia <br>Genetics Home Reference - Hyperprolinemia</ref>
People with hyperprolinemia type I have [[proline]] levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Some individuals with type I exhibit [[seizure]]s, [[mental retardation]] or other neurological problems.<ref name="ghr" />

===Hyperprolinemia type II===

Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15 times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]]. This rare form of the disorder may appear benign at times,<ref name="type2">{{cite journal |author=Onenli-Mungan N, Yuksel B, Elkay M, Topaloglu AK, Bakal T, Ozer G |title=Type II hyperprolinemia: a case study |journal=Turk J Pediatr. |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=167–169 |year=2004 |pmid=15214748 }}</ref> but often involves seizures, convulsions, and mental retardation.<ref  name="ghr" />

Hyperprolinemia can also occur with other conditions, such as malnutrition or liver disease. In particular, individuals with conditions that cause elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood, such as lactic acidemia, are likely to have elevated [[proline]] levels, because lactic acid inhibits the breakdown of proline.<ref name="ghr" />

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Hyperprolinemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Mutations in the ''[[ALDH4A1]]'' and ''[[PRODH]]'' genes cause hyperprolinemia.<ref name="ghr" />

Hyperprolinemia type I is caused by a mutation in the ''PRODH'' gene, which codes for the enzyme [[proline oxidase]]. This enzyme begins the process of degrading proline by starting the reaction that converts it to pyrroline-5-carboxylate.

Hyperprolinemia type II is caused by a mutation in the ''ALDH4A1'' gene, for the enzyme [[1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase]]. This enzyme helps to break down the pyrroline-5-carboxylate produced in the previous reaction, converting it to the amino acid [[glutamine]]. The conversion between proline and glutamine, and the reverse reaction controlled by different enzymes, are important factors required to maintain proper metabolism and protein production.

A deficiency of either proline oxidase or pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase results in a buildup of proline in the body. A deficiency of the latter enzyme leads to higher levels of proline and a buildup of the intermediate breakdown product pyrroline-5-carboxylate, causing the signs and symptoms of hyperprolinemia type II.

Hyperprolinemia is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are [[heterozygous]] carriers, having only one copy of the altered gene, without having signs and symptoms of the disorder. 

In about one-third of cases of hyperprolinemia, individuals carrying one copy of an altered ''PRODH'' gene have moderately elevated levels of proline in their blood, but these levels do not cause any health problems.<ref name="ghr" /> Individuals with one altered ''ALDH4A1'' gene have normal levels of proline in their blood.

==Research==
A 2005 study on rats suggested that hyperprolininemia causes cognitive dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bavaresco CS, Streck EL, Netto CA, Wyse AT |title=Chronic hyperprolinemia provokes a memory deficit in the Morris water maze task |journal=Metab Brain Dis |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=73–80 |year=2005 |pmid=15918552 |doi= 10.1007/s11011-005-2478-x|url=http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0885-7490&volume=20&issue=1&spage=73}}</ref>
