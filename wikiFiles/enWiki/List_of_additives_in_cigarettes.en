{{Globalize/US|date=June 2012}}
This is the '''list of 599 additives in cigarettes''' submitted to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] in April 1994. It applies, as documented, only to American manufactured cigarettes intended for distribution within the United States by the listed companies. The five major [[tobacco company|tobacco companies]] that reported the information were:
* [[American Tobacco Company]]
* [[Brown and Williamson]]
* [[Liggett Group, Inc.]]
* [[Altria Group|Philip Morris Inc.]]
* [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]]

One significant issue is that while all these [[chemical compound]]s have been approved as [[food additive|additives to food]], they were not tested by [[combustion|burning]]. Burning changes the properties of chemicals. More than 4,000 chemical compounds are created by burning a [[cigarette]].<ref>BAT December 12, 1986, Mutagenic Activity of Flavour Compounds.
