'''Diktyoma''', or ciliary body [[medulloepithelioma]], or teratoneuroma, is a rare tumor arising from primitive medullary epithelium in the [[ciliary body]] of the [[human eye|eye]]. Almost all diktyomas arise in the ciliary body, although, rarely, they may arise from the [[optic nerve]] head or [[retina]].<ref name="Broughton">BroughtonWL, Zimmerman LE. A clinicopathologic study of 56 cases of intraocular medulloepitheliomas. Am J Ophthalmol 1978; 85(3): 407–418.</ref> 

The name "diktyoma" comes from its characteristic findings on [[histology]].

==Classification==
Diktyoma is classified into teratoid and nonteratoid types, based on heteroplastic tissue in the former. Each type may be sub-classified as [[Benign tumor|benign]] or [[Cancer|malignant]] based on [[histology]].<ref name="Chung">Chung EM, Specht CS, Schroeder JW. From the archives of the AFIP: Pediatric orbit tumors and tumorlike lesions: neuroepithelial lesions of the ocular globe and optic nerve. Radiographics. 2007 Jul-Aug;27(4):1159-86.</ref>

Based on histology, the tumor is classified as malignant if it contains poorly differentiated [[neuroblast]]s, [[nuclear pleomorphism]], markedly abnormal [[Mitosis|mitotic activity]], [[Sarcoma|sarcomatous components]], or invasion into the [[uvea]], [[cornea]], or [[sclera]].<ref name="Broughton"/> Most diktyomas are malignant.<ref name="Broughton"/><ref name="Shield">ShieldsJA, Eagle RC Jr, Shields CL, Potter PD. Congenital neoplasms of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (medulloepithelioma). Ophthalmology 1996; 103(12): 1998–2006.</ref>

==Signs and Symptoms==
The most common symptoms of diktyoma are [[vision loss]] and pain, while the most common signs are [[leukocoria]] and presence of a mass in the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] or ciliary body.<ref name="Broughton"/><ref name="McLean">McLeanIW, Burnier MN, Zimmerman LE, Jakobiec FA. Tumors of the retina. In: Rosai J, Sobin LH, eds. Atlas of tumor pathology: tumors of the eye and ocular adnexa. Washington, DC: Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, 1994; 101–135.</ref> Other signs and symptoms include [[ectopia lentis|lens subluxation]], [[glaucoma]], [[cataract]], [[exophthalmos]], [[buphthalmos]], [[strabismus]], and [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]].

==Diagnosis==
===Imaging findings===
Imaging studies such as [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] (US), [[Computerized Tomography]] (CT) and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) may aid [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. On ultrasound, diktyomas typically appear as echogenic, irregularly shaped to ovoid masses.<ref>FosterRE, Murray TG, Byrne SF, et al. Echographic features of medulloepithelioma. Am J Ophthalmol 2000; 130(3): 364–366.</ref><ref name="Vajaranant">VajaranantTS, Mafee MF, Kapur R, Rapoport M, Edward DP. Medulloepithelioma of the ciliary body and optic nerve: clinicopathologic, CT, and MR imaging features. Neuroimaging Clin N Am 2005; 15(1): 69–83.</ref> Ultrasound is excellent for demonstrating cystic collections of vitreous fluid in the tumor, and may show [[Dystrophic calcification|calcifications]] in the teratoid type.

On CT, dityomas typically appear as dense, irregular masses in the ciliary body, which enhances with administration of intravenous contrast material.<ref>PeymanGA, Mafee MF. Uveal melanoma and similar lesions: the role of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Radiol Clin North Am 1987; 25(3): 471–486.</ref> CT is excellent for demonstrating [[dystrophic calcification]]s in the teratoid type.<ref name="Shield"/><ref name="Vajaranant"/>

On MRI, dityomas typically appear slightly to moderately hyperdense to vitreous on T1-weighted images and hypodense on T2-weighted images, with marked homogeneous enhancement (except for prominent parts of cystic components, which, if present, may impart heterogeneity) after administration of intravenous contrast material.<ref name="Vajaranant"/> MRI is excellent for detection of tumors as small as 2 millimeters.<ref>PotterPD, Shields CL, Shields JA, Flanders AE. The role of magnetic resonance imaging in children with intraocular tumors and simulating lesions. Ophthalmology 1996; 103(11): 1774–1783.</ref>

===Gross pathologic findings===
Grossly, the tumor appears white, gray, or yellow, with irregular surface, often studded with small cysts.<ref name="Chung"/> More small cysts may be found on cut sections. These cysts may break off the surface and float freely in aqueous or [[vitreous humour]].<ref name="Shield"/><ref name="Font">FontR, Croxatto J, Rao N. Tumors of the optic nerve and optic nerve head: medulloepithelioma. In: Silverberg S, Sobin L, eds. AFIP atlas of tumor pathology: tumors of the eye and ocular adnexa. Washington, DC: American Registry of Pathology, 2006; 148–149.</ref> The tumor may also contain chalky grayish white particles. The lens may be covered by a semi-translucent membrane in some case.<ref name="Chung"/> Tumor may invade locally to involve the iris or anterior retina, or through the cornea or sclera. In advanced cases, tumor may fill the enture globe, similar to [[retinoblastoma]].<ref name="Chung"/>

===Histologic findings===
Microscopically, the tumor cells recapitulate embryonic sensory retina or nonpigmented ciliary epithelium. The chalky grayish white particles within the tumor mass correspond to foci of [[cartilage]] on histology; the semi-translucent membrane covering the lens in some tumors corresponds to spreading neoplastic cells.<ref name="Shield"/><ref name="Vajaranant"/>

Tumor cells form a characteristic ''diktyomatous'' pattern, with folded cords and sheets resembling a fisherman's net.<ref name="Chung"/> In early development of the retina, the medullary epithelial cells acquire polarity, such that a basement membrane associated with the vitreous forms the internal limiting membrane on one side, while terminal bars form the outer limiting membrane on the other side. Proliferating tumor cells of diktyoma maintain the same polarity, arranged in cords and sheets folding back upon themselves. Depending on the direction of the folding, some folds surround fluid collection, while others do not.<ref name="Broughton"/> These fluid-filled spaces correspond to the grossly observed small cysts, which are mainly composed of vitreous humor.<ref name="Broughton"/>

About 30-50 percent of diktyomas contain heteroplastic elements, and thus belong to the teratoid subtype.<ref name="Broughton"/><ref name="Shield"/> These heteroplatic elements may include [[hyaline cartilage]], [[rhabdomyoblast]]s, and neuroglial tissue.<ref name="Chung"/> Sarcomatous elements may be seen in malignant tumors. Foci of dystrophic calcifications may be present.

== Treatment and prognosis==
Diktyoma is treated by either close observation, or [[enucleation of the eye]]. [[Segmental resection|Surgical resection]] is no longer done due to risk of late complications and metastases. Small lesions can be treated with iodine-125 plaque brachytherapy.<ref>Davidorf FH, Craig E, Birhanin L, Wakely P. Management of medulloepithelioma of the ciliary body with brachytherapy. Am J Ophthalmol. 2002;133:841-843.</ref> Distant metastases and mortality are rare. Mortality may occur in patients with extraocular extension to the brain.<ref name="Broughton"/><ref name="Shield"/><ref name="Vajaranant"/> Lack of glial differentiation, as demonstrated by negative staining for [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP), may confer a favourable prognosis.<ref>Janss AJ, Yachnis AT, Silber JH, et al. Glial differentiation predicts poor clinical outcome in primitive neuroectodermal brain tumours. Ann Neurol 1996;39:481-489.</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Mean age at diagnosis is 5 years.<ref name="Broughton"/><ref name="McLean"/> While most cases occur in young children, adult cases have been reported.<ref name="Broughton"/><ref name="Font"/> [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is similar in male and female and among different races.
