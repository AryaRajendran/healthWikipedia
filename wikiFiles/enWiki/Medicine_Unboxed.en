'''Medicine Unboxed''' is a project arising from a view that good medicine demands more than scientific and technical expertise, and that it necessitates ethical judgment, an understanding of human experience, empathy, professionalism and wisdom. 

Medicine Unboxed is a not-for-profit organisation that has held four international conferences ("Unboxing Medicine" in 2009, "Stories, Language and Medicine" in 2010, "Medicjne and Values" in 2011 and "Belief" in 2012) in [[Cheltenham]], UK. The aim of Medicine Unboxed is to explore "understanding medicine through the arts and humanities", and engage the public and front-line [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] staff with a view of medicine that is infused and elaborated by the humanities, with a view to promoting dialogue around the goals and values of medicine within society. Contributors to the conferences include artists, writers, the clergy, poets, philosophers, lawyers, linguists, musicians, theatre, ethicists, academics and doctors. 

Previous notable contributors include [[Amateur Transplants]], [[Dannie Abse]], [[Gwyneth Lewis]], [[Jo Shapcott]], [[Frank Harsent]], [[Gabriel Weston]] and [[Raymond Tallis]]. Medicine Unboxed is curated by Dr. Sam Guglani, Consultant Oncologist at [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital|Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], that supports the organisation along with the [[Wellcome Foundation]]. The Creative Director is [[Peter_J_Thomas|Peter Thomas]] and advisors are Dr. Sean Elyan and Dame Janet Trotter.
