The '''corpus luteum''' ([[Latin]] for "yellow body") (plural '''corpora lutea''') is a temporary [[endocrine]] structure in [[female mammals]] that is involved in the production of relatively high levels of [[progesterone]] and moderate levels of [[estradiol]] and [[inhibin A]]. It is colored as a result of concentrating [[carotenoid]]s from the diet and secretes a moderate amount of [[estrogen]] to inhibit further release of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) and thus secretion of [[Luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH).

==Development and structure== <!--Granulosa lutein cell and Theca lutein cell redirect here-->
The ''corpus luteum'' develops from an [[ovarian follicle]] during the [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]] or [[estrous cycle]], following the release of a secondary oocyte from the follicle during [[ovulation]]. The follicle first forms a [[corpus hemorrhagicum]] before it becomes a corpus luteum, but the term refers to the visible collection of blood left after rupture of the follicle that secretes progesterone. While the [[oocyte]] (later the [[zygote]] if fertilization occurs) traverses the [[Fallopian tube]] into the [[uterus]], the corpus luteum remains in the [[ovary]].

The corpus luteum is typically very large relative to the size of the ovary; in humans, the size of the structure ranges from under 2&nbsp;cm to 5&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name="drspock">{{cite web |url=http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,5335,00.html |title=Corpus Luteum Cyst of Pregnancy |work=DrSpock.com |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref><ref name="rbmonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.rbmonline.com/Article/2155 |title=FSH and follucogenesis: from physiology to ovarian stimulation |format= |work=Reproductive biomedicine Online |author=Vegetti W, Alagna F |year=2006 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>

Progesterone is synthesized from cholesterol by both the large and small luteal cells upon luteal maturation.  Cholesterol-LDL complexes bind to receptors on the plasma membrane of luteal cells and are internalized. Cholesterol is released and stored within the cell as cholesterol ester. LDL is recycled for further cholesterol transport.  Large luteal cells produce more progesterone due to uninhibited/basal levels of PKA activity within the cell. Small luteal cells have LH receptors that regulate PKA activity within the cell. PKA actively phosphorylates StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and PBR (peripheral benzodiazepine receptors) to transport cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane.<ref name="pmid11882010">{{cite journal | author = Niswender GD | title = Molecular control of luteal secretion of progesterone | journal = Reproduction | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–9 | year = 2002 | month = March | pmid = 11882010 | doi = 10.1530/rep.0.1230333 }}</ref>

The development of the corpus luteum is accompanied by an increase in the level of the steroidogenic enzyme [[P450scc]] that converts cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]] in the mitochondria.<ref name="pmid9545562">{{cite journal | author = Rapoport R, Sklan D, Wolfenson D, Shaham-Albalancy A, Hanukoglu I | title = Antioxidant capacity is correlated with steroidogenic status of the corpus luteum during the bovine estrous cycle | journal = Biochim.

During the bovine estrous cycle, plasma levels of progesterone increase in parallel to the levels of P450scc and its electron donor adrenodoxin, indicating that progesterone secretion is a result of enhanced expression of P450scc in the corpus luteum.<ref name="pmid9545562" />

The [[androgen]]s are shown in blue field, and [[aromatase]] at lower center - the enzyme present in granulosa lutein cells that convert androgens into [[estrogen]]s (shown in pink triangle).]]
Like the previous theca cells, the theca lutein cells lack the [[aromatase]] enzyme that is necessary to produce estrogen, so they can only perform [[steroidogenesis]] until formation of [[androgen]]s.<ref name="Boron2004-Ch54"/> The granulosa lutein cells do have aromatase, and use it to produce estrogens, using the androgens previously synthesized by the theca lutein cells, as the granulosa lutein cells in themselves do not have the [[17α-hydroxylase]] or [[17,20 lyase]] to produce androgens.<ref name="Boron2004-Ch54">Chapter 54, The Female Reproductive System > THE OVARIAN STEROIDS, in: {{cite book |author=Boron WF, Boulpaep EL |title=Medical Physiology: A  Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year=2004 |pages=1300 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> 

Once the corpus luteum regressed the remnant is known as [[corpus albicans]].<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1563350]</ref>

==Function==
The corpus luteum is essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in females. The corpus luteum secretes [[progesterone]], which is a [[steroid hormone]] responsible for the [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (its development) and maintenance, respectively.

===When egg is not fertilized===
If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum stops secreting progesterone and decays (after approximately 14 days in humans). It then degenerates into a [[corpus albicans]], which is a mass of fibrous [[scar]] tissue. 

The uterine lining sloughs off without progesterone and is expelled through the vagina (in humans and some great apes, which go through a [[menstrual cycle]]). In an [[estrous cycle]], the lining degenerates back to normal size.

===When egg is fertilized===
If the egg is fertilized and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] occurs, the syncytiotrophoblast (derived from [[trophoblast]]) cells of the [[blastocyst]] secrete the hormone [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG, or a similar hormone in other species) by day 9 post-fertilization.

Human chorionic gonadotropin signals the corpus luteum to continue progesterone secretion, thereby maintaining the thick lining (endometrium) of the uterus and providing an area rich in [[blood vessel]]s in which the [[zygote]](s) can develop. From this point on, the corpus luteum is called the ''corpus luteum graviditatis''.

The introduction of [[prostaglandin]]s at this point causes the degeneration of the corpus luteum and the [[abortion]] of the [[fetus]]. However, in placental animals such as humans, the [[placenta]] eventually takes over progesterone production and the corpus luteum degrades into a [[corpus albicans]] without embryo/fetus loss.

[[Luteal support]] refers to the administration of medication (generally [[progestin]]s) for the purpose of increasing the success of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.

===Content of carotenoids===

The yellow color and name of the corpus luteum, like that of the [[macula lutea]] of the retina, is due to its concentration of certain [[carotenoid]]s, especially [[lutein]]. In 1968, a report indicated that beta-carotene was synthesized in laboratory conditions in slices of corpus luteum from cows. However, attempts have been made to replicate these findings, but have not succeeded. The idea is not presently accepted by the scientific community.<ref>Brian Davis. Carotenoid metabolism as a preparation for function. Pure & Applied Chemistry, Vol. 63, No. 1, pp. 131–140, 1991.  [http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1991/pdf/6301x0131.pdf available online.] Accessed April 30, 2010.</ref> Rather, the corpus luteum concentrates carotenoids from the diet of the mammal.
