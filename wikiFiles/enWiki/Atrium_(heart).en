In [[anatomy]], the '''atrium''' ''(plural: '''atria''')'', sometimes called '''auricle''' (although in the technical sense, the auricle is a separate part of the main atria<ref>http://www.drugs.com/dict/auricles-of-atria.html</ref> known as the [[atrial appendage (disambiguation)|atrial appendage]]s), refers to a chamber or space.  For example, the term is used for a portion of the lateral ventricle in the brain and the [[blood]] collection chamber of the [[heart]].  The atrium most commonly refers to a chamber in which blood enters
the heart, as opposed to the ventricle, where it is pushed out of the organ. It has a thin-walled structure that allows blood to return to the heart. There is at least one atrium in animals with a [[closed circulatory system]].  In [[fish]], the circulatory system is very simple: a two-chambered heart including one atrium and one [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]].  In other [[vertebrate]] groups, the [[circulatory system]] is much more complicated. Their circulatory systems are divided into two types: a three-chambered heart, with two atria and one ventricle, or a four-chambered heart, with two atria and two ventricles. The atrium receives blood as it returns to the heart to complete a circulating cycle, whereas the ventricle pumps blood out of the heart to start a new cycle.<ref>http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/adult_cardiac/anatomy.cfm</ref><ref>http://www.ivy-rose.co.uk/HumanBody/Blood/Heart_Structure.php</ref>

==Human heart==

[[Human]]s have a four-chambered heart that includes the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the [[superior vena cava]], [[inferior vena cava]] and [[coronary sinus]]. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the [[pulmonary veins|left and right pulmonary veins]].<ref>http://www.ivy-rose.co.uk/HumanBody/Blood/Heart_Structure.php</ref> The atria do not have valves at their inlets.<ref>http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4598</ref>  As a result, a venous pulsation is normal and can be detected in the [[jugular vein]] as the [[jugular venous pressure]].<ref>http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Jugular-Venous-Pressure.htm</ref><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=cm&part=A622#A629</ref> 
Internally, there is the rough musculae pectinati and [[crista terminalis]], which acts as a boundary inside the atrium and the smooth walled part derived from the [[sinus venosus]].<ref>http://www.med.unc.edu/embryo_images/unit-cardev/cardev_htms/cardev040.htm</ref> There is also a [[fossa ovalis (heart)|fossa ovalis]] in the [[interatrial septum]], which is used in the [[fetus|fetal]] period as a means of bypassing the lung.The atrium is depolarized by Calcium.

There are two atria, one on either side of the heart.<ref>http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/adult_cardiac/anatomy.cfm</ref>  On the right side is the atrium that holds blood that is deoxygenated.  It sends blood to the right ventricle, which sends it to the lungs for oxygen. After it comes back, it is sent to the left atrium.  The blood is pumped from the left atrium and sent to the left ventricle where it is sent to the [[aorta]], which takes it to the rest of the body.<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hhw/hhw_anatomy.html Human heart anatomy diagram.] Retrieved on 2010-07-02.</ref>

==Atrial function==

In human physiology, the atria facilitate circulation primarily by allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart during [[Systole (medicine)|ventricular systole]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=A3OmTSgtOgwC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Anderson, RM. ''The Gross Physiology of the Cardiovascular System'' (2nd ed., 2012).] See "Chapter 1: Normal Physiology."</ref><ref>[http://cardiac-output.info/1967AHJ.pdf Anderson, R.M., Fritz, J.M., and O’Hare, J.E. “The Mechanical Nature of the Heart as a Pump.” American Heart Journal 73 (1967): 92-105.]</ref> By being partially empty and distensible, atria prevent the interruption of [[Vein|venous flow]] to the heart that would occur during ventricular systole if the veins ended at the inlet valves of the heart.  In normal physiologic states, the output of the heart is pulsatile, and the venous inflow to the heart is continuous and non-pulsatile.  But without functioning atria, venous flow becomes pulsatile, and the overall circulation rate decreases significantly.<ref>[http://cardiac-output.info/the-determinants-of-cardiac/ The Determinants of Cardiac Output] (video produced by University of Arizona Biomedical Communications; demonstration of atrial effect begings at 13:43).</ref><ref>http://cardiac-output.info (See discussion of atrial effect in text Chapter 1.)</ref>

Atria have four essential characteristics that cause them to promote continuous venous flow. (1) There are no atrial inlet valves to interrupt blood flow during atrial systole. (2) The atrial systole contractions are incomplete and thus do not contract to the extent that would block flow from the veins through the atria into the ventricles. During atrial systole, blood not only empties from the atria to the ventricles, but blood continues to flow uninterrupted from the [[vein]]s right through the atria into the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. (3) The atrial contractions must be gentle enough so that the force of contraction does not exert significant back pressure that would impede venous flow. (4) The "let go" of the atria must be timed so that they relax before the start of ventricular contraction, to be able to accept venous flow without interruption.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=A3OmTSgtOgwC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Anderson, RM. ''The Gross Physiology of the Cardiovascular System (2nd ed.)''] See "Chapter 1: Normal Physiology."</ref><ref>[http://cardiac-output.info/1967AHJ.pdf Anderson, R.M., Fritz, J.M., and O’Hare, J.E. “The Mechanical Nature of the Heart as a Pump.” American Heart Journal 73 (1967): 92-105.]</ref>

By preventing the inertia of interrupted venous flow that would otherwise occur at each ventricular systole, atria allow approximately 75% more cardiac output than would otherwise occur. The fact that atrial contraction is 15% of the amount of the succeeding ventricular ejection has led to a misplaced emphasis on their role in pumping up the ventricles (the so-called "atrial kick"), whereas the key benefit of atria is in preventing circulatory inertia and allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=A3OmTSgtOgwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Gross Physiology of the Cardiovascular System'' at 11.]</ref><ref>[http://cardiac-output.info/1967AHJ.pdf Anderson, R.M., Fritz, J.M., and O’Hare, J.E. “The Mechanical Nature of the Heart as a Pump.” American Heart Journal 73 (1967): 92-105.]</ref>
