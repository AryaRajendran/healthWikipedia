'''Jablonski by Pahls v. United States''', [[Case citation|712 F.2d 391 (9th Cir. 1983)]] is a landmark case in which the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] determined that a [[mental health professional]]'s [[duty to predict dangerousness]] includes consulting a patient's prior records, and that their [[duty to protect]] includes the [[involuntary commitment]] of a dangerous individual; simply warning the foreseeable victim is insufficient.

==Facts==
Mr. Jablonski was dating Ms. Kimball but had threatened to kill her and her mother (Ms. Pahls).  After one incident that culminated in a threat towards her mother, she took him to the [[Loma Linda VA Hospital]], where the doctor conducted a risk assessment, but did not consult his prior records; which documented a history of violent behavior. Based on this incomplete data, he determined erroneously that Jablonski was not a danger to himself or others and released him. He warned Ms. Kimball to leave Jablonski but did not warn her of his potential for violence. When he was released, he killed her.<ref>

==Ruling==
The court ruled that the doctor's failure to secure the patient's previous records constituted negligence, as the information in his files would have affected the risk assessment and thus the actions taken to protect the foreseeable victim.<ref>

==Legacy==
The legal precedent set by this case extends the duty of the mental health professional to secure previous records when conducting a risk assessment, and the duty to protect to include the involuntary hospitalization of a dangerous individual.
