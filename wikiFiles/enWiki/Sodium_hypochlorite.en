'''Sodium hypochlorite''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NaClO. [[Sodium]] hypochlorite solution, commonly known as [[bleach]] or liquid bleach, is frequently used as a [[disinfectant]] or a bleaching agent.<ref name="Technology Economics Program">{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/sodium-hypochlorite-chemical-production|title=Sodium Hypochlorite Chemical Production|publisher=by Intratec, ISBN 978-0615702179}}</ref>

==Production==
Sodium hypochlorite was first produced in 1789 by [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] in his laboratory on the quay [[Javel - André Citroën (Paris Métro)|Javel]] in [[Paris]], France, by passing [[chlorine]] gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as "''Eau de Javel''" ("Javel water"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. However, this process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. One such method involved the extraction of chlorinated lime (known as bleaching powder) with sodium carbonate to yield low levels of available chlorine. This method was commonly used to produce hypochlorite solutions for use as a hospital antiseptic that was sold after World War I under the trade names "Eusol" and "Dakin's solution".

Near the end of the nineteenth century, E. S. Smith patented the [[chloralkali process]]: a method of producing sodium hypochlorite involving the electrolysis of [[brine]] to produce [[sodium hydroxide]] and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite.<ref>{{cite web | title=How Products Are Made Volume 2 |date = may 2011| url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Bleach.html}}</ref>  Both electric power and brine solution were in cheap supply at the time, and various enterprising marketers took advantage of the situation to satisfy the market's demand for sodium hypochlorite. Bottled solutions of sodium hypochlorite were sold under numerous trade names.

Today, an improved version of this method, known as the Hooker process, is the only large scale industrial method of sodium hypochlorite production. In the process, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) are formed when chlorine is passed into cold and dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] solution. It<!--does this refer to chlorine--> is prepared industrially by [[electrolysis]] with minimal separation between the [[anode]] and the [[cathode]]. The solution must be kept below 40 °C (by cooling coils) to prevent the undesired formation of [[sodium chlorate]].

:  Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H<sub>2</sub>O

Hence, chlorine is simultaneously reduced and oxidized; this process is known as [[disproportionation]].

The commercial solutions always contain significant amounts of sodium chloride (common salt) as the main [[by-product]], as seen in the equation above.

==Packaging and sale==
Household bleach sold for use in laundering clothes is a 3-8[[Mass concentration (chemistry)|% solution]] of sodium hypochlorite at the time of manufacture.  Strength varies from one formulation to another and gradually decreases with long storage.

A 12% solution is widely used in waterworks for the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of water, and a 15% solution is more commonly<ref>Metcalf & Eddy, Inc (1991). ''Wastewater Engineering: Treatment, Disposal, & Reuse'' 3rd Edition; pg 497</ref> used for disinfection of waste water in  treatment plants. Sodium hypochlorite can also be used for point-of-use disinfection of drinking water.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Sodium hypochlorite dosage for household and emergency water treatment | url = http://www.awwa.org/publications/journal-awwa/abstract/articleid/15941.aspx | journal = E-Journal AWWA | volume = 100 | issue = 8 | year = 2008 | author = Daniele S. Lantagne}}</ref>

Milder solutions (50 ppm to 1.5%) are found in disinfecting sprays and wipes used on hard surfaces.<ref>Ernest R. Vieira, ''Elementary Food Science'', pp. 381-382, Springer, 1999 ISBN 0834216574.</ref><ref>Lynn R. Marotz, ''Health, Safety, and Nutrition for the Young Child'', pp. 126-127, Cengage Learning, 2011 ISBN 1111298378.</ref>

==Reactions==

Sodium hypochlorite reacts gradually with metals such as zinc to produce the metal oxide or hydroxide:

: NaClO + Zn → ZnO + NaCl

It reacts with hydrochloric acid to release chlorine gas:

: NaClO + 2 HCl → Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl

It reacts with other acids, such as acetic acid, to release [[hypochlorous acid]]:

: NaClO + CH<sub>3</sub>COOH → HClO + CH<sub>3</sub>COONa

It decomposes when heated to form sodium chlorate and sodium chloride:

: 3 NaClO → NaClO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaCl

In reaction with hydrogen peroxide it gives off molecular oxygen:

: NaClO + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl + O<sub>2</sub>↑
When dissolved in water it will slowly decompose, releasing chlorine, oxygen and sodium and hydroxide ions.
: 4 NaClO + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 4 Na<sup>+</sup> + 4 OH<sup>-</sup> + 2 Cl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>

Sodium hypochlorite reacts with most nitrogen compounds to form volatile [[chloramines]], dichloramines, and nitrogen trichloride:
: NH<sub>3</sub> + NaOCl → NH<sub>2</sub>Cl + NaOH 
: NH<sub>2</sub>Cl+ NaOCl → NHCl<sub>2</sub> + NaOH
: NHCl<sub>2</sub> + NaOCl → NCl<sub>3</sub> + NaOH
In the presence of a [[phase-transfer catalyst]], alcohols are oxidized to the corresponding [[carbonyl]] compound.<ref>{{cite journal | author = G. A. Mirafzal and A. M. Lozeva | title = Phase transfer catalyzed oxidation of alcohols with sodium hypochlorite | year = 1998 | journal = [[Tetrahedron Letters]] | volume = 39 | issue = 40 | pages = 7263–7266 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(98)01584-6}}</ref>

==Uses==

===Bleaching===

Household bleach is, in general, a solution containing 3-8% sodium hypochlorite and 0.01-0.05% sodium hydroxide; the [[sodium hydroxide]] is used to delay the breakdown of sodium hypochlorite into [[sodium chloride]] and [[sodium chlorate]].<ref name=Smith1994>Smith WT. (1994). Human and Environmental Safety of Hypochlorite. In: [http://books.google.com/books?id=Pbr2HJ1X_DkC Proceedings of the 3rd World Conference on Detergents: Global Perspectives], pp. 183-5.</ref>

In household form, sodium hypochlorite is used for removal of stains from laundry. It is particularly effective on cotton fiber, which stains easily but bleaches well. Usually 50 to 250 mL of bleach per load is recommended for a standard-size washer. The properties of household bleach that make it effective for removing stains also result in cumulative damage to organic fibers, such as cotton, and the useful lifespan of these materials will be shortened with regular bleaching. The [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) that is also found in household bleach (as noted later) causes fiber degradation as well. It is not volatile, and residual amounts of NaOH not rinsed out will continue slowly degrading organic fibers in the presence of humidity.  For these reasons, if stains are localized, spot treatments should be considered whenever possible. With safety precautions, post-treatment with [[vinegar]] (or another weak acid) will neutralize the NaOH, and volatilize the chlorine from residual hypochlorite. Old
T-shirts and cotton sheets that rip easily demonstrate the costs of laundering with household bleach. Hot water increases the effectiveness of the bleach, owing to the increased reactivity of the molecules.

===Disinfection===

A weak solution of 2% household bleach in warm water is used to sanitize smooth surfaces prior to brewing of beer or wine.  Surfaces must be rinsed to avoid imparting flavors to the brew; these chlorinated byproducts of sanitizing surfaces are also harmful.

US Government regulations (21 CFR Part 178) allow food processing equipment and food contact surfaces to be sanitized with solutions containing bleach, provided that the solution is allowed to drain adequately before contact with food, and that the solutions do not exceed 200 parts per million (ppm) available chlorine (for example, one tablespoon of typical household bleach containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, per gallon of water). If higher concentrations are used, the surface must be rinsed with potable water after sanitizing.

A 1-in-5 dilution of household bleach with water (1 part bleach to 4 parts water) is effective against many [[bacteria]] and some [[virus]]es, and is often the disinfectant of choice in cleaning surfaces in hospitals (primarily in the United States). The solution is [[corrosion|corrosive]], and needs to be thoroughly removed afterwards, so the bleach disinfection is sometimes followed by an [[ethanol]] disinfection. Even "scientific-grade", commercially produced disinfection solutions such as Virocidin-X usually have sodium hypochlorite as their sole '''active''' ingredient, though they also contain [[surfactants]] (to prevent beading) and fragrances (to conceal the bleach smell).<ref>http://www.kamscientific.com/</ref>

See [[Hypochlorous acid#Mode of disinfectant action|Hypochlorous acid]] for a discussion of the mechanism for disinfectant action.

Treatment of Gingivitis <ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1875-595X.2011.00111.x/abstract</ref>
Diluted sodium hypochlorite at a rate of 20-1 (0.05% concentration) may represent an efficacious, safe and affordable antimicrobial agent in the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease.

===Water treatment===
Sodium hypochlorite has been used for the disinfection of drinking water or water systems. The use of chlorine-based disinfectants in domestic water, although widespread, has led to some controversy due to the formation of small quantities of harmful byproducts such as [[chloroform]].

Additionally, transport and handling safety concerns have directed public opinion towards the use of sodium hypochlorite rather than chlorine gas in water treatment, which represents a significant market expansion potential.<ref name="Technology Economics Program"/>

Sodium hypochlorite solutions have been used to treat dilute [[cyanide]] wastewater, such as [[electroplating]] wastes. In batch treatment operations, sodium hypochlorite has been used to treat more concentrated cyanide wastes, such as silver cyanide plating solutions. Toxic cyanide is oxidized to cyanate (OCN<sup>&minus;</sup>) that is not toxic, idealized as follows:

:CN<sup>&minus;</sup> + OCl<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; CNO<sup>&minus;</sup> + Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>

Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used as a [[biocide]] in industrial applications to control slime and bacteria formation in water systems used at power plants, pulp and paper mills, etc. in solutions typically of 10%-15% by weight.

===Endodontics===
Sodium hypochlorite is now used in [[endodontics]] during root canal treatments. It is the medicament of choice due to its efficacy against pathogenic organisms and pulp digestion. In previous times, [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]]'s solution (0.5%) had been used. Its concentration for use in endodontics today varies from 0.5% to 5.25%. At low concentrations it will dissolve mainly necrotic tissue; whereas at higher concentrations tissue dissolution is better but it also dissolves vital tissue, a generally undesirable effect. It has been shown that clinical effectiveness does not increase conclusively for concentrations higher than 1%.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zehnder M | title = Tissue dissolving capacity and antibacterial effect of buffered and unbuffered hypochlorite solutions | year = 2002 | journal = Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radio Endodon | volume = 94 | pages = 756–62 | doi = 10.1067/moe.2002.128961 | pmid = 12464903 | issue = 6 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Kosicki | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Luder | first3 = Hansueli | last4 = Sener | first4 = Beatrice | last5 = Waltimo | first5 = Tuomas}}</ref>

===Nerve Agent Neutralization===
At the various [[nerve agent]] destruction facilities throughout the United States, 50% sodium hypochlorite is used as a means of removing all traces of nerve agent or blister agent from PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) after an entry is made by personnel into toxic areas. 50% sodium hypochlorite is also used to neutralize any accidental releases of nerve agent in the toxic areas. Lesser concentrations of sodium hypochlorite are used in similar fashion in the PAS (Pollution Abatement System) to ensure that no nerve agent is released in furnace flue gas.

==Safety==
Sodium hypochlorite is a strong [[oxidizer]]. Oxidation reactions are corrosive, solutions burn skin and cause eye damage, in particular, when used in concentrated forms.  However, as recognized by the NFPA, only solutions containing more than 40% sodium hypochlorite by weight are considered hazardous oxidizers.  Solutions less than 40% are classified as a moderate oxidizing hazard (NFPA 430, 2000).

Chlorination of drinking water can oxidize organic contaminants, producing [[trihalomethane]]s (also called haloforms), which are [[carcinogenic]].

Household bleach and pool chlorinator solutions are typically stabilized by a significant concentration of [[sodium hydroxide|lye]] (caustic soda, NaOH) as part of the manufacturing reaction.  Skin contact will produce caustic irritation or burns due to [[defatting (medical)|defatting]] and [[saponification]] of skin oils and destruction of tissue.  The slippery feel of bleach on skin is due to this process. Trichloramine, the gas that is in swimming pools can cause atopic asthma.<ref name="autogenerated1">http://web.ebscohost.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=4f22085a-4990-46a5-801d-8a6b4687bc63%40sessionmgr11&vid=2&hid=14</ref>

[[Sodium thiosulfate]] (thio) is an effective chlorine neutralizer.  Rinsing with a 5&nbsp;mg/L solution, followed by washing with soap and water, quickly removes chlorine odor from the hands.

Mixing bleach with some household cleaners can be hazardous.  For example, mixing an [[acid]] cleaner with sodium hypochlorite bleach generates [[chlorine]] gas. Mixing with [[ammonia]] solutions (including [[urine]]) produces [[chloramine]]s. Mixtures of other cleaning agents and or organic matter can result in a gaseous reaction that can cause acute lung injury.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> 

: NH<sub>4</sub>OH + NaClO → NaOH + NH<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O

Both chlorine gas and chloramine gas are [[toxic]]. Bleach can react violently with [[hydrogen peroxide]] and produce oxygen gas:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/3347/h2o2+bleach4.html|title=Hydrogen Peroxide + Bleach Explanation|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref>

:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq) + NaClO(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)

It is estimated that there are about 3300 accidents needing hospital treatment caused by sodium hypochlorite solutions each year in British homes (RoSPA, 2002).

One major concern arising from sodium hypochlorite use is that it tends to form chlorinated organic compounds; this can occur during household storage and use as well during industrial use.<ref name=Smith1994/> For example, when household bleach and wastewater were mixed, 1-2% of the available chlorine was observed to form organic compounds.<ref name=Smith1994/> As of 1994, not all the byproducts had been identified, but identified compounds include [[chloroform]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]].<ref name=Smith1994/> The estimated exposure to these chemicals from use is estimated to be within occupational exposure limits.<ref name=Smith1994/>

A recent European study indicated that sodium hypochlorite and organic chemicals (e.g., surfactants, fragrances) contained in several household cleaning products can react to generate chlorinated [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs).<ref>Odabasi, M., “Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds from the Use of Chlorine-Bleach- Containing Household Products”, Environmental Science & Technology 42, 1445-1451, (2008). Available at: http://pubs.acs.org/journals/esthag/</ref> These chlorinated compounds are emitted during cleaning applications, some of which are toxic and probable human carcinogens. The study showed that indoor air concentrations significantly increase (8-52 times for chloroform and 1-1170 times for carbon tetrachloride, respectively, above baseline quantities in the household) during the use of bleach containing products. The increase in chlorinated volatile organic compound concentrations was the lowest for plain bleach and the highest for the products in the form of “thick liquid and gel”. The significant increases observed in indoor air concentrations of several chlorinated VOCs (especially carbon tetrachloride and chloroform) indicate that the bleach use may be a source that could be important in terms of inhalation exposure to these compounds. While the authors suggested that using these cleaning products may significantly increase the cancer risk,<ref>Odabasi, M., “Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds from the Use of Chlorine-Bleach- Containing Household Products, Slide presentation (2008). Available at: http://www.slideworld.org/ViewSlides.aspx?URL=5092</ref> this conclusion appears to be hypothetical:

:* The highest level cited for concentration of carbon tetrachloride (seemingly of highest concern) is 459 micrograms per cubic meter, translating to 0.073 ppm (part per million), or 73 ppb (part per billion). The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-allowable time-weighted average concentration over an eight-hour period is 10 ppm,<ref name=OSHA_CCl4>http://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_225800.html</ref> almost 140 times higher;
:* The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] highest allowable peak concentration (5-minute exposure for five minutes in a 4-hour period) is 200 ppm,<ref name=OSHA_CCl4/> twice as high as the reported highest peak level (from the headspace of a bottle of a sample of bleach plus detergent).

Further studies of the use of these products and other possible exposure routes (i.e., dermal) may reveal other risks. Though the author further cited ozone depletion greenhouse effects for these gases, the very low amount of such gases, generated as prescribed, should minimize their contribution relative to other sources.
