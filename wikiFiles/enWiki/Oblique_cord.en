The '''oblique cord''' is a [[ligament]] between the [[ulna]]r and [[radius]] bones in the lower arm near the [[elbow]]. It takes the form of a small, flattened band, extending downward and lateralward, from the lateral side of the [[Tuberosity of the ulna|ulnar tuberosity]] at the base of the [[coronoid process of the ulna|coronoid process]] to the [[radius]] a little below the [[radial tuberosity]].<ref name="Platzer-122">{{cite book

}}</ref> Its fibers run in the opposite direction to those of the [[Interosseous membrane of the forearm]].<ref name="Platzer-122" />

It is called by other names including '''oblique ligament''', '''chorda obliqua''', '''radio-ulnar ligament''', '''chorda oblique antebrachii anterior''', '''proximal interosseous band''', '''dorsal oblique accessory cord''', '''proximal band of the interosseous membrane''', '''superior oblique ligament''', '''oblique ligament proper''', '''round ligament''', and '''ligament of [[Josias Weitbrecht|Weitbrecht]]'''.<ref name="Tubbs"/>

It has no known function and can be cut without apparent consequence.<ref name="Tubbs"/>

==Dimensions==
A study upon the arms of 38 people found that its mean length is 3.4 cm (range 2.4 to 4.2 cm) and in most people it tapers from the ulna to the radius end, being at the ulna 9 mm, in its middle, 7mm and its radius end 4 mm.<ref name="Tubbs"/>

==Function==

It has been suggested to strengthen the interosseus membrane proximally,<ref name="Platzer-122" /> provide restraint for the rotatory movements of the forearm,<ref name="Martin"/> or that the ligament may stop bone bending and preventing buckling failure.<ref name="Martin">Martin BF.(1958). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1244995/pdf/janat00450-0137.pdf The oblique cord of the forearm.] J Anat. 92(4):609&ndash;15.  PMID 13587394 </ref> However, due the orientation of its fibers, the oblique cord is unlikely to transfer force due to limb loading from the radius to the ulna.<ref name="Patel">Patel BA. (2005). Form and function of the oblique cord (chorda obliqua) in anthropoid primates.Primates. 46(1):47&ndash;57. PMID 15241636</ref>

One recent comparative study upon primates concluded:
<blockquote>The oblique cord does not limit supination, nor does it seem to have a role in preventing radial buckling failure or
reducing bending strain. What, then, is the oblique cord for? The oblique cord may simply be an additional tie between the radius and ulna aiding other soft tissue structures such as the annular ligament and interosseous membrane. Additionally, the oblique cord may prevent anterior shearing of the proximal radius under extreme compressive loads.<ref name="Patel"/></blockquote>

A study on humans concluded that it "appears insignificant in stability of the proximal forearm."<ref name="Tubbs"/> It has been suggested that its presence in modern humans may be a [[vestigial]] body part for a [[biped]] that was important due to the load-bearing function of the upper limb in evolutionarily earlier [[quadruped]] human ancestors.<ref name="Patel"/>

==Variability==
The shape and form of the ligament have been found in humans [[cadaver]]s to vary from a rounded cord to a flat membrane.<ref name="Martin"/> Further, it is not found in all humans being variably found to be absent in half of arms,<ref name="Tubbs">Tubbs RS, O'Neil JT Jr, Key CD, Zarzour JG, Fulghum SB, Kim EJ, Lyerly MJ, Shoja MM, George Salter E, Jerry Oakes W.

J Hand Surg Am. 22(6):981&ndash;5.PMID  9471064</ref> It is found in most [[primates]] though not in the family of [[New World monkey]]s that includes [[spider monkey|spider]] and [[woolly monkey]]s called [[ateline]]s.<ref name="Patel"/>
