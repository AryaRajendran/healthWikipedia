'''''Cryptosporidium parvum''''' is one of several [[protozoa]]l species that cause [[cryptosporidiosis]], a [[parasitic disease]] of the [[mammal]]ian [[intestine|intestinal tract]].

Primary symptoms of ''C. parvum'' infection are acute, watery, and non-bloody [[diarrhoea]]. ''C. parvum'' infection is of particular concern in [[immunocompromised]] patients, where diarrhoea can reach 10–15L per day. Other symptoms may include [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[nausea]]/[[vomiting]] and [[abdomen|abdominal]] pain. Extra-intestinal sites include the lung, liver and gall bladder where it causes respiratory cryptosporidosis, hepatitis and cholecystitis.<ref>”Cryptosporidiosis.” Laboratory Identification of Parasites of Public Health Concern. CDC. 5 Sept 2007. <http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Cryptosporidiosis.htm></ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}}

Infection is caused by ingestion of [[sporulate]]d [[oocyst]]s transmitted by the faecal-oral route. In healthy human hosts, the median infective dose is 132 oocysts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DuPont HL, Chappell CL, Sterling CR, Okhuysen PC, Rose JB, Jakubowski W |title=The infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum in healthy volunteers |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=332 |issue=13 |pages=855–9 |year=1995 |month=March |pmid=7870140 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=7870140&promo=ONFLNS19 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199503303321304}}</ref> The general [[Cryptosporidium#Life_cycle|''C. parvum'' life cycle]] is shared by other members of the genus. Invasion of the [[wikt:apical|apical]] tip of [[ileal]] [[enterocyte]]s by [[sporozoite]]s and [[merozoite]]s causes pathology seen in the disease. 

Infection is generally self-limiting in immunocompetent people. In immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, infection may not be self-limiting, leading to dehydration and, in severe cases, death.  

The diagnosis of ''C. parvum'' consists of serological tests and microscopic evaluation of oocysts in stools using [[Kinyoun]] acid-fast staining.

''C. parvum'' is considered to be the most important waterborne pathogen in developed countries. The protozoa also caused the largest waterborne-disease outbreak ever documented in the United States, making 403,000 people ill in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1993. <ref>”Surveillance for Waterborne-Disease Outbreaks -- United States, 1993-1994” CDC. 1996. <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00040818.htm></ref> It is resistant to all practical levels of [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], surviving for 24hrs at 1000&nbsp;mg/L free chlorine. It is an [[obligate intracellular pathogen]].<ref>{{cite pmid|14711592}}</ref>

==Genome==

The genome of ''C. parvum'' (sequenced in 2004<ref name="Abrahamsen_2004">{{cite journal | author = Abrahamsen MS, Templeton TJ, ''et al.'' | title = Complete genome sequence of the apicomplexan, ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5669 | pages = 441–5 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15044751 | doi = 10.1126/science.1094786 | accessdate = 2008-05-25| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/304/5669/441}}{{subscription required}}</ref>) have a relatively small size and simple organization of 9.1 Mb, which is composed of eight chromosomes ranging from 1.04 to 1.5 Mb. The genome is very compact, and is one of the few organisms without [[transposable element]]s.  Unlike other [[apicomplexa]]ns, ''C. parvum'' has no genes in its [[plastid]]s or [[mitochrondria]].<ref name="Abrahamsen_2004"/>

==Treatment==

Supportive therapy such as IV fluids is the primary for ''C. parvum'' infection. [[Paromomycin]] and [[Nitazoxanide]] may alleviate some of the diarrhoeal symptoms, however the latter is contraindicated for AIDS patients. Continuing [[antiretroviral drug]]s to boost the immune system may also control infection. Research into other potential drugs and therapeutics targets, as well as vaccine candidates, is ongoing.
'''''Spiramycin''''' for immunosuppressed patients.

==Important ''C. parvum'' proteins and drug targets==
===Lipid metabolism===

''C. parvum'' is incapable of de novo lipid synthesis, making its lipid trafficking machinery an important potential therapeutic target. ''C. parvum'' possesses multiple [[oxysterol-binding protein]]s (OSBPs), and oxysterol related proteins (OSRPs). Only OSBPs are capable of lipid binding, while both contain [[Pleckstrin homology domain]]s, which function in cell signalling pathways.

===Surface glycoproteins===
''C. parvum'' possesses numerous surface [[glycoprotein]]s thought to play a role in pathogenesis. An immunodominant >900kDa protein, known as GP900, localizes to the apical end of sporozoites and in [[microneme]]s of merozoites. Its high molecular mass is most likely due to heavy post-translational glycosylation. Indeed, the structure of GP900 is similar to that of a family of glycoproteins known as [[mucin]]s. GP900 is thought to mediate attachment and invasion to host cells. GP900 may also play a role in ''C. parvum’s'' resistance to [[proteolysis]] by the numerous [[proteases]] found in the mammalian gut.

In vitro, hyperimmune sera as well as antibodies directed at specific [[epitope]]s on the GP900 protein inhibit the invasion of ''C. parvum'' sporozoites into MDCK cell monolayers. Additionally, competitive inhibition using native GP900 or purified GP900 fragments reduces cell invasion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barnes DA, Bonnin A, Huang JX, ''et al.'' |title=A novel multi-domain mucin-like glycoprotein of Cryptosporidium parvum mediates invasion |journal=Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. |volume=96 |issue=1–2 |pages=93–110 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9851610 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-6851(98)00119-4 |doi=10.1016/S0166-6851(98)00119-4}}</ref> 

Further experiments have confirmed the importance of the mucin-like glycosylations. Lectins directed at GP900 carbohydrate moieties (alpha-N-galactosamine) were able to block adhesion and prevent ''C. parvum'' invasion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cevallos AM, Bhat N, Verdon R, ''et al.'' |title=Mediation of Cryptosporidium parvum Infection In Vitro by Mucin-Like Glycoproteins Defined by a Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=68 |issue=9 |pages=5167–75 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=10948140 |pmc=101770 |url=http://iai.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10948140 |doi=10.1128/IAI.68.9.5167-5175.2000}}</ref>

''C. parvum'' glycoproteins have the characteristics of attractive vaccine candidates. Many are immunodominant, and antibodies against select domains block invasion of host cells.
