The '''cardia''' is the [[anatomy|anatomical]] term for the part of the [[stomach]] attached to the  [[esophagus]]. The cardia begins immediately distal to the '''z-line''' of the gastroesophageal junction, where the [[squamous epithelium]] of the [[esophagus]] gives way to the [[columnar epithelium]] of the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="accessmedicine.com">Barrett KE, "Chapter 7. Esophageal Motility" (Chapter). Barrett KE: Gastrointestinal Physiology: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=2307248</ref> 

Near the cardia at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction is the anatomically indistinct but physiologically demonstrable '''lower esophageal sphincter.'''<ref name="isbn 0071547703">{{isbn 0071547703}}</ref> The area termed the cardia overlaps with the lower esophageal sphincter;<ref name="accessmedicine.com"/> however, the cardia does not contain the lower esophageal sphincter. Although the topic was previously disputed, current consensus states that the cardia is part of the stomach.<ref name="isbn 0071547703"/><ref name="isbn 0071434143">{{isbn 0071434143}}</ref>

The cardia overlaps with but specifically does not contain the '''lower esophageal sphincter (LES)'''<ref name="accessmedicine.com"/> (also termed '''cardiac sphincter''',<ref>{{eMedicineDictionary|cardiac+sphincter}}</ref> '''gastroesophageal sphincter''', and '''esophageal sphincter'''<ref>[http://www.mcg.edu/Otolaryngology/patientGERD.htm Patient Handout: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>). This is in contrast to the "[[upper esophageal sphincter]]" contained in the [[hypopharynx]] (area extending from the base of the tongue to the cricoid cartilage) and consists of striated muscle controlled by somatic innervation.<ref name="accessmedicine.com"/>

The z-line is usually within the LES, thus LES can be identified by z-line color that changes from salmon pink to a deeper red.<ref>Gastrointestinal disease: an endoscopic approach, By Anthony J. DiMarino, p.166</ref> But, a study correlating manometric and endoscopic localization of the LES (z-line) found that the functional location of LES was 3 cm distal to the z-line. <ref>{{cite web|author=GI Motility online |url=http://www.nature.com/gimo/contents/pt1/full/gimo6.html |title=Esophagus - anatomy and development : GI Motility online |publisher=Nature.com |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref>

==Nomenclature and classification==
There were previously conflicting statements in the academic anatomy community<ref>[http://hopkins-gi.nts.jhu.edu/pages/latin/templates/index.cfm?pg=disease1&organ=1&disease=13&lang_id=1 Digestive Disease Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.physio.unr.edu/ICC/gallery/LES-1.htm Department of Physiology and Cell Biology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{eMedicine|med|2965}}</ref> over whether the cardia is part of the stomach, part of the esophagus or a distinct entity. Modern surgical and medical textbooks have agreed that "The gastric cardia is now clearly considered to be part of the stomach."<ref name="accessmedicine.com"/><ref name="isbn 0071434143"/> 

Classical [[anatomy]] textbooks, and some other resources,<ref>{{SUNYAnatomyLabs|37|06|01|03}} - "Abdominal Cavity: The Stomach"</ref> describe the cardia as the first of 4 regions of the stomach. This makes sense [[Histology|histologically]] because the mucosa of the cardia is the same as that of the stomach.

==Function==
The stomach generates strong [[acid]]s (HCl) and [[enzyme]]s (such as pepsin) to aid in food [[digestion]]. This digestive mixture is called [[gastric juice]]. The inner lining of the stomach has several mechanisms to resist the effect of gastric juice on itself, but the mucosa of the esophagus does not. The esophagus is normally protected from these acids by a one-way valve mechanism at its junction with the stomach. This one-way valve is called the esophageal sphincter (ES), and this, along with the [[angle of His]] formed here, prevents gastric juice from flowing back into the esophagus.

During [[peristalsis]], the ES allows the food [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] to pass into the stomach. It prevents [[chyme]], a mixture of bolus, [[stomach acid]], and [[digestive enzyme]]s, from returning up the esophagus. The ES is aided in the task of keeping the flow of materials in one direction by the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].

The ES is a functional sphincter but not an anatomical sphincter. {{Citation needed|reason= this has been under debate for some time, but my university anatomy lecturer is positive there is no anatomical sphincter. Can't find much on the internet to reference this|date=April 2012}} That is to say, though there is no thickening of the smooth muscle, as in the pyloric sphincter, chyme is (usually) prevented from travelleling back from the stomach up the esophagus. The lower crus of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] helps this sphincteric action. <ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54272/ |title=Neuromuscular Anatomy of Esophagus and Lower Esophageal Sphincter - Motor Function of the Pharynx, Esophagus, and its Sphincters - NCBI Bookshelf |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref>

==Histology==
On histological examination, the junction can be identified by the following transition:<ref>{{BUHistology|11101loa}}</ref><ref>{{BUHistology|11111ooa}}</ref>

* nonkeratinized [[stratified squamous epithelium]] in the [[esophagus]]
* [[simple columnar epithelium]] in the [[stomach]]

However, in [[Barrett's esophagus]], the epithelial distinction may vary, so the histological border may not be identical with the functional border.

The [[cardiac glands]] can be seen in this region. They can be distinguished from other stomach glands ([[fundic glands]] and [[pyloric glands]]) because the glands are shallow and simple [[tubular glands|tubular]].

==Pathology==
Deficiencies in the strength or the efficiency of the LES lead to various medical problems involving acid damage on the esophagus. 

In [[achalasia]], one of the defects is failure of the LES to relax properly; causing [[Megaesophagus]].

==Removal== <!-- Cardiectomy redirects here-->
Surgical removal of this area is a called a "cardiactomy". "Cardiectomy" is a term that is also used to describe removal of the [[heart]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cardiectomy cardiectomy] at dictionary.reference.com</ref><ref Name="BARLOW">{{cite journal  | last =O.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kardia'' meaning ''heart'', the cardiac orifice of the stomach.
