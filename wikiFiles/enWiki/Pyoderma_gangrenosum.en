'''Pyoderma gangrenosum''' is a condition that causes [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] to become [[necrosis|necrotic]], causing deep [[Skin ulcer|ulcers]] that usually occur on the legs.  When they occur, they can lead to [[chronic wound]]s.  Ulcers usually initially look like small bug bites or [[papule]]s, and they progress to larger ulcers.  Though the [[wound]]s rarely lead to death, they can cause [[pain]] and [[scar]]ring.

The disease was identified in 1930.  It affects approximately 1 person in 100,000 in the population.  Though it can affect people of any age, it mostly affects people in their 40s and 50s.<ref name="Jackson and Callen">{{cite web |first1=J Mark |last1=Jackson |first2=Jeffrey P |last2=Callen |editor1-first=Dirk M |editor1-last=Elston |date=April 23, 2012  |url=http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic367.htm |work=Emedicine |title=Pyoderma Gangrenosum}}</ref>

==Types==

[[File:Pyoderma gangrenosum 01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pyoderma gangrenosum]]
There are two main types of pyoderma gangrenosum:<ref name="Jackson and Callen"/>
* the 'typical' ulcerative form, which occurs in the legs
* an 'atypical' form that is more superficial and occurs in the hands and other parts of the body

Other variations are:<ref name="pmid16858047">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7560.181 |pmc=1513476 |title=Diagnosis and treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum |year=2006 |last1=Brooklyn |first1=T. |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7560 |pages=181–4 |pmid=16858047 |last2=Dunnill |first2=G |last3=Probert |first3=C}}</ref>
* Peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum is 15% of all cases of pyoderma
* Bullous pyoderma gangrenosum
* Pustular pyoderma gangrenosum<ref name="pmid14616824">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2230.2003.01418.x |title=Pustular pyoderma gangrenosum |year=2003 |last1=Shankar |first1=S. |last2=Sterling |first2=J.

==Causes==
Though the [[etiology]] is not well understood, the disease is thought to be due to [[immune system]] dysfunction, and particularly improper functioning of [[neutrophil]]s.  At least half of all pyoderma gangrenosum patients also suffer from illnesses that affect their systemic function.<ref name="Jackson and Callen"/> For instance, [[ulcerative colitis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[multiple myeloma]] (MM) sufferers have the condition. It can also be part of a syndrome, for instance in [[PAPA syndrome]].  Major and minor trauma are also believed to play a role.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2008.02626.x |title=Seat belt pyoderma gangrenosum: Minor pressure as a causative factor |year=2008 |last1=Rashid |first1=RM |journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1273–4 |pmid=18837131}}</ref>

==Treatment==
First-line therapy for disseminated or localized instances of pyoderma gangrenosum is systemic treatment by [[corticosteroids]] and [[cyclosporine]]. Topical application of Clobetasol, Mupirocin, and Gentamycin alternated with Tacrolimus can be effective. Surgical intervention at the wound site is necessary for "proud flesh" to be abraded and lessen instances of "rolled" out flaps preventing smooth joins with normal flesh.

Papules that begin as small "spouts" can be treated with Dakins Solution to prevent infection and entire wounds cluster also benefit from this disinfectant. Wet to dry applications of Dakins can defeat spread of interior infection. Heavy drainage can be offset with Koban dressings. Grafting is not recommended due to tissue necrosis. 

If ineffective, alternative therapeutic procedures include systemic treatment with corticosteroids and [[mycophenolate mofetil]]; mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine; [[tacrolimus]]; [[thalidomide]]; [[infliximab]]; or [[plasmapheresis]].<ref name="pmid16021123">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2004.10.006 |title=Treatment recommendations for pyoderma gangrenosum: An evidence-based review of the literature based on more than 350 patients |year=2005 |last1=Reichrath |first1=Jörg |last2=Bens |first2=Guido |last3=Bonowitz |first3=Anette |last4=Tilgen |first4=Wolfgang |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=273–83 |pmid=16021123}}</ref>
