'''Pes anserine bursitis''' is an inflammatory condition of the [[Human_Anatomical_Terms#Close_to_or_away_from_the_center_of_the_body|medial]] (inner) knee at the [[anserine bursa]], a sub muscular [[synovial bursa|bursa]], just below the [[pes anserinus]].  

== Pathology ==
The pes anserinus is the anatomic term used to identify the insertion of the conjoined tendons [[Sartorius muscle|Sartorius]], [[Gracilis muscle|Gracilis]], and [[Semitendinosus]] into the anteromedial proximal [[tibia]].  Theoretically, [[bursitis]] results from stress to this area (e.g. stress may result when an obese individual with anatomic deformity from arthritis ascends or descends stairs).  An occurrence of pes anserine bursitis commonly is characterized by pain, especially when climbing stairs, tenderness, and local swelling.<ref name="Glencross">[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/308694-overview Pes Anserinus Bursitis], ''eMedicine.com'', MD. M. Glencross. </ref>

=== Pathophysiology ===
The etymology of the name relates to the insertion of the conjoined tendons into the anteromedial proximal tibia. From anterior to posterior, the pes anserinus is made up of the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. The tendon's name, which literally means "goose's foot," was inspired by the pes anserinus's webbed, footlike structure. The conjoined tendon lies superficial to the tibial insertion of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee. 

==Muscles involved==
*[[Sartorius muscle|Sartorius]] aids in knee and hip flexion, as in sitting or climbing; abducts and laterally rotates thigh; innervated by the [[femoral nerve]].<ref name="Saladin">K. Saladin, ''Anatomy & Physiology 5th Edition'', 2010, McGraw-Hill.</ref>
*[[Gracilis muscle|Gracilis]] flexes and medially rotates tibia at knee; innervated by the [[obturator nerve]].<ref name="Saladin" />
*[[Semitendinosus]] flexes knee; medially rotates tibia on femur when knee is flexed; medially rotates femur when hip is extended; counteracts forward bending at hips; innervated by [[tibial nerve]] and [[common fibular nerve]].<ref name="Saladin" />
