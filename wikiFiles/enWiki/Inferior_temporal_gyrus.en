The '''inferior temporal gyrus''' is placed below the [[middle temporal gyrus]], and is connected behind with the [[inferior occipital gyrus]]; it also extends around the infero-lateral border on to the inferior surface of the [[temporal lobe]], where it is limited by the [[inferior sulcus]]. This region is one of the higher levels of the [[ventral stream]] of visual processing, associated with the representation of complex object features, such as global shape.{{cn|date=April 2013}}  It may also be involved in face perception,{{cn|date=April 2013}} and in the recognition of numbers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2013/april/numerals.html | title=Scientists pinpoint brainâ€™s area for numeral recognition | publisher=Stanford School of Medicine | date=APRIL 16, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-30 | author=BRUCE GOLDMAN}}</ref>
