A '''Jefferson fracture''' is a [[bone fracture]] of the anterior and [[Atlas (anatomy)#Posterior arch|posterior arches]] of the C1 vertebra,<ref name = Wheeless>{{cite web | url = http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/atlas_frx_jefferson_fracture | title = Atlas Frx / Jefferson Fracture  | accessdate = 2007-11-29 | last = Wheeless | first = Clifford | publisher = [[Duke University]] Division of Orthopaedic Surgery }}</ref> though it may also appear as a three or two part fracture.  The fracture may result from an axial load on the back of the head or [[Extension (kinesiology)|hyperextension]] of the neck (e.g. caused by [[diving]]), causing a posterior break, and may be accompanied by a break in other parts of the [[cervical spine]].<ref name = Wheeless/>

It is named after the [[United Kingdom|British]] neurologist and neurosurgeon Sir [[Geoffrey Jefferson]], who reported four cases of the fracture in 1920 in addition to reviewing cases that had been reported previously.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jefferson G|title=Fracture of the atlas vertebra: report of four cases, and a review of those previously recorded|year=1920|journal=Br J Surg| volume=7|issue=27|pages=407–22|doi=10.1002/bjs.1800072713}}</ref>

==Etiology==
Jefferson fracture is often caused by an impact or load on the [[Occiput|back of the head]], and are frequently associated with diving into shallow water, impact against the roof of a vehicle and falls,<ref name = Foster>{{cite web | url = http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic31.htm | title = C1 Fractures | date = 2006-12-01 | accessdate = 2007-11-29 | last = Foster | first = Mark | publisher = [[WebMD]] }}</ref> and in children may occur due to falls from playground equipment.<ref name = Korinth>{{cite journal |author=Korinth MC, Kapser A, Weinzierl MR |title=Jefferson fracture in a child--illustrative case report |journal=Pediatr Neurosurg |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=526–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17992046 |doi=10.1159/000108801}}</ref>  Less frequently, strong [[rotation]] of the head may also result in Jefferson fractures.<ref name = Foster/>

Jefferson fractures are extremely rare in children, but recovery is usually complete without [[surgery]].<ref name = Korinth/>

==Symptoms==
Individuals with Jefferson fractures usually experience [[pain]] in the upper neck but no [[Neurology#Testing_examinations|neurological signs]].  The fracture may also cause damage to the arteries in the neck, resulting in [[lateral medullary syndrome]], [[Horner's syndrome]], [[ataxia]], and the inability to sense pain or temperature.<ref name = Wheeless/>

In rare cases, [[Congenital disorder|congenital abnormality]] may cause the same symptoms as a Jefferson fracture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Zoete A, Langeveld UA |title=A congenital anomaly of the atlas as a diagnostic dilemma: a case report |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=62–4 |year=2007 |pmid=17224357 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2006.11.011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gehweiler JA, Daffner RH, Roberts L |title=Malformations of the atlas vertebra simulating the Jefferson fracture |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=140 |issue=6 |pages=1083–6 |year=1983 |pmid=6602470 |doi=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The use of [[surgery]] to treat a Jefferson fracture is somewhat controversial.<ref name = Hein>{{cite journal |author=Hein C, Richter HP, Rath SA |title=Atlantoaxial screw fixation for the treatment of isolated and combined unstable jefferson fractures - experiences with 8 patients |journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien) |volume=144 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |year=2002 |pmid=12434175 |doi=10.1007/s00701-002-0998-2}}</ref>  Non-surgical treatment varies depending on if the fracture is stable or unstable, defined by an intact or broken [[Transverse ligament of the atlas|transverse ligament]] and degree of fracture of the [[Atlas (anatomy)#Anterior arch|anterior arch]].<ref name = Wheeless/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee C, Woodring JH |title=Unstable Jefferson variant atlas fractures: an unrecognized cervical injury |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=1105–10 |year=1991 |pmid=1763734 |doi=}}</ref>  An intact ligament requires the use of a soft or hard collar, while a ruptured ligament may require [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]], a [[Halo (medicine)|halo]] or surgery.  The use of rigid halos can lead to intracranial infections and are often uncomfortable for individuals wearing them, and may be replaced with a more flexible alternative depending on the stability of the injured bones, but treatment of a stable injury with a halo collar can result in a full recovery.<ref name = Lee>{{cite journal |author=Lee TT, Green BA, Petrin DR |title=Treatment of stable burst fracture of the atlas (Jefferson fracture) with rigid cervical collar |journal=Spine |volume=23 |issue=18 |pages=1963–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9779528 |doi=10.1097/00007632-199809150-00008}}</ref>  Surgical treatment of a Jefferson fracture involves [[Vertebral fusion|fusion]] or [[Vertebral fixation|fixation]] of the first three [[cervical vertebrae]];<ref name = Wheeless/><ref name = Hein/> fusion may occur immediately, or later during treatment in cases where non-surgical interventions are unsuccessful.<ref name = Hein/>  A primary factor in deciding between surgical and non-surgical intervention is the degree of stability<ref name = Hein/><ref name = Lee/> as well as the presence of damage to other cervical vertebrae.<ref name = Lee/>  

Though a serious injury, the long-term consequences of a Jefferson's fracture are uncertain and may not impact longevity or abilities, even if untreated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mindell ER |title=James Platt White, MD (1811-1881): his interesting and remarkable accident |journal=Clin.
