'''Transurethral resection of the prostate''' (commonly known as a '''TURP''', plural '''TURPs''', and rarely as a '''transurethral prostatic resection''', '''TUPR''') is a [[urology|urological]] operation. It is used to treat [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH). As the name indicates, it is performed by visualising the [[prostate]] through the [[urethra]] and removing tissue by [[electrocautery]] or sharp dissection. This is considered the most effective treatment for BPH. This procedure is done with spinal or general anaesthetic. A triple lumen [[catheter]] is inserted through the urethra to irrigate and drain the bladder after the surgical procedure is complete. Outcome is considered excellent for 80-90% of BPH patients.

== Indications ==
BPH is normally initially treated medically. This is done through [[alpha blocker|alpha]] [[Receptor antagonists|antagonists]] such as [[Flomax]] or [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor|alpha-1A reductase inhibitors]] such as [[Proscar]] and [[Avodart]]. If medical treatment does not reduce a patient's urinary symptoms, a TURP may be considered following a careful examination of the prostate/bladder through a [[cystoscope]]. If TURP is contraindicated a Urologist may consider: a simple [[prostatectomy]], in and out catheters, or a supra-pubic catheter to help a patient void urine effectively.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/449781-overview#showall Collins, MD; Chief Editor: Edward David Kim, MD Transurethral Resection of the Prostate  Medscape:]</ref>  As medical management of BPH improves, the numbers of TURPs have been decreasing.

==Types of TURP==
See [[Prostatectomy#Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate_(TURP)]] for details of monopolar TURP, bipolar TURP and laser prostate surgery.

==Risks==
[[File:Equipment for TUR-P.jpg|thumb|Equipment for a TURP. From left to right: optic, introduction mandrin, resection mandrin, sling, resectosope.]]
Because of bleeding risks associated with the surgery, TURP is not considered safe for many patients with cardiac problems.

* Clot retention and clot colic
* Bladder wall injury such as perforation (rare)
* [[TURP Syndrome]]: [[Hyponatremia]] and [[water intoxication]] (symptoms resembling brain stroke in an elderly presenting patient) caused by an overload of fluid absorption (e.g. 3 to 4 Litres) from the open prostatic sinusiods during the procedure. This complication can lead to confusion, changes in mental status, vomiting, nausea, and even coma. To prevent TURP syndrome the 1) length of the procedure is limited to less than one hour in many centers, and 2) the height of the container of irrigating solution above the surgical table determining the hydrostatic pressure driving fluid into the prostatic veins and sinuses is kept to a minimum.<ref name=Imiak1999>{{cite web |url=http://www.uam.es/departamentos/medicina/anesnet/journals/ija/vol3n1/turp.htm |title=TURP Syndrome |author=Imiak et al. |date=1 Jan 1999 }}</ref>
* Bladder neck [[stenosis]]
* [[Urinary incontinence]] due to injury of external sphincter system which may be prevented by taking the Verumontanum of the prostate as a distal limiting boundary during TURP
* [[Retrograde ejaculation]] due to injury of preprostatic (internal) sphincter system

Additionally, transurethral resection of the prostate is associated with a low risk of mortality.
