'''Arbovirus''' is a term used to refer to a group of [[virus]]es that are [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[arthropod]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. The word ''arbovirus'' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] ('''AR'''thropod-'''BO'''rne viruses).<ref name=cdc >{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/arbdet.htm|title=CDC Information on Arboviral Encephalitides|accessdate=2007-02-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070127130301/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/arbdet.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Some arboviruses are able to cause [[Emergent virus|emergent disease]].

==Transmission==
[[file:Aedes Albopictus.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Aedes albopictus]]'', a known vector for transmission of many viral diseases]]
Arboviruses replicate in the vector but usually do not harm it. In the mosquito-borne diseases, the virus establishes a persistent infection in the salivary glands and there is sufficient virus in the saliva to infect another host during feeding. Upon biting, the virus enters the [[circulatory system]], where [[intracellular]] [[self-replication]] of the virus can lead to [[viremia]], a condition in which viruses are capable of travelling throughout the body through the bloodstream.<ref name="scarbo" >{{cite report|author=Hunt, M.|date=April 9, 2010|title=Arboviruses|url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mhunt/arbo.htm|publisher=University of South Carolina School of Medicine}}</ref> This serves as an excellent form of transmission, as many female mosquitoes require the ingestion of vertebrate blood in order for their eggs to develop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Human blood contains the secret ingredient for mosquito eggs|url=http://nittygrittyscience.com/2011/05/04/human-blood-contains-the-secret-ingredient-for-mosquito-eggs/|date=May 4, 2011}}</ref>

==Structure and genome==
The majority of the arboviruses are spherical in shape although a few are rod-shaped. They are 17-150&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] in diameter and most have an [[RNA]] [[genome]] (the single exception is [[African swine fever virus]], which has a [[DNA]] genome).

==Signs and symptoms==
Many arboviruses (such as African Swine Fever virus) do not normally infect humans or if so, cause either no symptoms or mild and transient [[infection]]s characterized by [[fever]], [[headache]] and [[rash]]. Others of this group however can cause [[epidemic]] disease and severe infections such as [[fulminant]] [[meningitis]], [[encephalitis]], [[meningoencephalitis]], or [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] that can be fatal.

===Immune response to infection===
The [[immune system]] plays a crucial role in defense against infection. Arboviruses are generally good inducers of the production of [[interferon]]s, which may partially explain why acute infection is often similar to influenza (fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia). Antibodies can be important in controlling viremia and limiting the severity of infection. Recovery typically involves the [[cell-mediated]] immune system.<ref name="scarbo" />

==Diagnosis==
Preliminary diagnosis of arbovirus infection is usually based off of clinical presentations of symptoms, places and dates of travel, activities and epidemiological history of the location where infection occurred.<ref name=cdcdiagnose >{{cite web|title=Arboviral Diagnostic Testing|url=http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/diagnosis.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Definitive [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is typically made in a [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] by employing some combination of [[blood test]]s, particularly [[immunology|immunologic]], [[serology|serologic]] and/or [[virology|virologic]] techniques such as [[ELISA]],<ref name=cdcdiagnose /><ref name=arboantibody >{{cite web|title=Arbovirus Antibodies Test|url=http://www.medicalhealthtests.com/pathology-test/arbovirus-antibodies-test-serum.html|date=March 27, 2012|publisher=Medical Health Tests}}</ref> [[Complement fixation test|complement fixation]],<ref name="arboantibody" /> [[polymerase chain reaction]],<ref>{{cite pmid|11337046|noedit}}</ref><ref name="arboantibody" /> [[Plaque reduction neutralization test|neutralization test]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seawright|first1=G.

==Prevention==
[[Vector control]] measures, especially [[mosquito control]], are essential to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining [[swamp]]s and removal of other pools of [[Water stagnation|stagnant water]] (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. [[Insecticide]]s can be applied in [[Rural area|rural]] and [[Urban area|urban]] areas, inside houses and other buildings or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use of some of these chemicals is controversial, and some [[organophosphate]]s and [[organochloride]]s (such as [[DDT]]) have been banned in many countries. [[Infertility|Infertile]] male mosquitoes have been introduced in some areas in order to reduce the breeding rate of relevant mosquito species. [[Larvicide]]s are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. [[Temefos]] is a common mosquito larvicide.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=J.A.|last2=Warren|first2=K.S.|year=1980|title=Selective primary health care: an interim strategy for disease control in developing countries|journal=Social Science & Medicine.

[[File:Mosquito net.jpg|thumb|Tent made of mosquito netting]]
People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing personal protective measures such as sleeping under [[mosquito net]]s, wearing [[Personal protective equipment|protective clothing]], applying [[insect repellent]]s such as [[permethrin]] and [[DEET]] to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: personal protective measures and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas. Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill juvenile (larvae) and adult mosquitoes.<ref name="ncarbo" >{{cite web|title=Preventing Mosquito Bites|url=http://epi.publichealth.nc.gov/cd/arbo/prevent.html|publisher=North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services}}</ref>

===Vaccination===
Vaccines are available for the following arboviral diseases:
*Japanese encephalitis<ref>{{cite web|title=Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine, What You Need to Know|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-je-ixiaro.pdf|date=December 7, 2011|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>
*Yellow fever<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow Fever Vaccine, What You Need to Know|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-yf.pdf|date=March 30, 2011|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

Vaccines are in development for the following arboviral diseases:
*Dengue fever<ref>{{cite web|title=Dengue fever vaccine program|url=http://www.globalvaccines.org/content/dengue+fever+vaccine+program/19615|publisher=Global Vaccines}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Because the arboviral encephalitides are viral diseases, antibiotics are not effective for treatment and no effective antiviral drugs have yet been discovered. Treatment is supportive, attempting to deal with problems such as swelling of the brain, loss of the automatic breathing activity of the brain and other treatable complications like bacterial pneumonia.<ref name=cdc />
