In [[medicine]], '''exhaled nitric oxide''' (eNO) can be measured in a [[breath test]] for [[asthma]] or other conditions characterized by [[airway]] [[inflammation]]. [[Nitric oxide]] (NO) is a gaseous [[molecule]] produced by certain [[Cell (biology)|cell]] types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FE<sub>NO</sub>)is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma. The breath test has recently become available in many well-equipped hospitals in developed countries, although its exact role remains unclear.

==Biology==
{{main|nitric oxide synthase}}
In humans, nitric oxide is produced from [[L-arginine]] by three [[enzymes]] called [[nitric oxide synthase]]s (NOS): inducible (iNOS), endothelial ([[Endothelial NOS|eNOS]]), and neuronal (nNOS). The latter two are constantly active in [[endothelial cell]]s and [[neuron]]s respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by [[cytokines]]). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including [[eosinophils]]. As such, eNO has been dubbed an ''inflammometer''.<ref name="pmid18076708">{{cite journal |author=Pijnenburg MW, De Jongste JC |title=Exhaled nitric oxide in childhood asthma: a review |journal=Clin.

It was initially thought that exhaled NO derived mostly from the sinuses, which contain high levels of NO. It has subsequently been shown that the lower airways contribute most of the exhaled NO, and that contamination from the sinuses is minimal.

==Medical use==

===Asthma===
Patients with [[asthma]] have higher eNO levels than other people. Their levels also rise together with other clinical and laboratory parameters of asthma (for example, the amount of [[eosinophils]] in their [[sputum]]). In conditions that trigger inflammation such as [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s or the inhalation of [[allergen]]s or [[plicatic acid]], eNO levels rise.<ref name="pmid16750986">{{cite journal |author=Vahlkvist S, Sinding M, Skamstrup K, Bisgaard H |title=Daily home measurements of exhaled nitric oxide in asthmatic children during natural birch pollen exposure |journal=J.

The fraction of eNO has been found to be a better test to identify asthmatics than basic lung function testing (for airway obstruction).

==Other conditions==
The role for eNO in other conditions is even less well established compared to asthma.

Since asthma can be a cause of [[chronic cough]]ing (it may even be the sole manifestation, such as in [[cough-variant asthma]]), studies have looked at whether eNO can be used in the diagnosis of chronic cough.<ref name="pmid18399857">{{cite journal |author=Fujimura M |title=Exhaled nitric oxide levels in patients with atopic cough and cough variant asthma |journal=Respirology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=359–64 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18399857 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01273.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1323-7799&date=2008&volume=13&issue=3&spage=359 |author-separator=, |author2=Ohkura N |author3=Abo M |display-authors=3 |last4=Furusho |first4=Shiho |last5=Waseda |first5=Yuko |last6=Ichikawa |first6=Yukari |last7=Hara |first7=Johsuke}}</ref><ref name="pmid18583518">{{cite journal |author=Oh MJ, Lee JY, Lee BJ, Choi DC |title=Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurement is Useful for the Exclusion of Non-asthmatic Eosinophilic Bronchitis in Chronic Cough Patients |journal=Chest |volume= 134|issue= 5|pages= 990–5|year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18583518 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-2541 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18583518}}</ref><ref name="pmid18614345">{{cite journal |author=Sato S |title=Clinical usefulness of fractional exhaled nitric oxide for diagnosing prolonged cough |journal=Respir Med |volume= 102|issue= 10|pages= 1452–9|year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18614345 |doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2008.04.018 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954-6111(08)00166-2 |author-separator=, |author2=Saito J |author3=Sato Y |display-authors=3 |last4=Ishii |first4=Taeko |last5=Xintao |first5=Wang |last6=Tanino |first6=Yoshinori |last7=Ishida |first7=Takashi |last8=Munakata |first8=Mitsuru}}</ref><ref name="pmid17976354">{{cite journal |author=Hahn PY, Morgenthaler TY, Lim KG |title=Use of exhaled nitric oxide in predicting response to inhaled corticosteroids for chronic cough |journal=Mayo Clin.

Exhaled NO is minimally increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but levels may rise in sudden worsenings of the disease ([[acute exacerbations of COPD|acute exacerbations]]) or disease progression. Early findings indicate a possible role for eNO in predicting the response to inhaled glucocorticoids and the degree of airway obstruction reversibility.

Children with cystic fibrosis have been found to have low eNO levels. In subjects with [[bronchiectasis]] (a state of localized, irreversible dilatation of part of the [[bronchial tree]]) not due to cystic fibrosis, high levels have been found. [[Sarcoidosis]] could also feature increased eNO. Low levels have been found in [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]], and [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]]. In the latter condition, ''inhaled'' NO is used as a diagnostic test of the response of the [[pulmonary arteries]] to [[vasodilators]] (agents that relax the blood vessels).

==Measurement techniques==
[[Image:Exhaled NO experiment.jpg|thumb|An experimental setup used to measure the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath samples. The subject blows into the tube (1) after a mouthpiece (2) has been connected to it. The wires on the side are part of the system that measures parameters like breath velocity, while the exhaled gas is taken to a FeNO analyzer (3).]]
The most widely used technique to measure eNO is with a [[chemical reaction]] that produces [[light]]; this is called a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction. The NO in the breath sample reacts with [[ozone]] to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] in an [[excited state]]. When this returns to its ground state, it emits light in quantities that are [[stoichiometry|proportional]] to the amount of exhaled NO.

The subject can exhale directly into a measurement device ('online' technique), or into a reservoir that can afterwards be connected to the analyser ('offline' technique).<ref name="pmid15817806">{{cite journal |author= |title=ATS/ERS recommendations for standardized procedures for the online and offline measurement of exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide, 2005 |journal=Am.

Aerocrine, a Swedish developer and seller of biomedical equipment, has patented a device call NIOX MINO that appears to measure NO levels with strong agreement in values with chemiluminescence. However, the patents are void of any detail regarding the operating principles behind the device or any evidence that the signal generated is due to nitric oxide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aerocrine|url=http://www.aerocrine.com/en/niox-mino/}}</ref>

==Reference range==
The upper normal level of eNO in different studies ranges from 20 to 30 [[parts per billion]]. However, several major features influence the reference values. Men have higher eNO values than women. Smoking notoriously lowers eNO values, and even former smoking status can influence results. The levels are higher in people with an [[atopic]] constitution (a tendency towards [[allergies]]).<ref name="pmid17478616">{{cite journal |author=Travers J |title=Reference ranges for exhaled nitric oxide derived from a random community survey of adults |journal=Am.

==History==
Until the 1980s, nitric oxide, a product of [[fossil fuel]] combustion, was thought only to play a role the detrimental effects of [[air pollution]] on the [[respiratory tract]].<ref name="pmid18188021"/> In 1987, experiments with [[coronary arteries]] showed that nitric oxide was the long sought [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]]. After scientists realised that NO played a biological role, its role as a [[cell signalling]] molecule and [[neurotransmitter]] became clear from abundant studies.<ref name="pmid17504190">{{cite journal |author=Turner S |title=The role of exhaled nitric oxide in the diagnosis, management and treatment of asthma |journal=Mini Rev Med Chem |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=539–42 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17504190 |doi= 10.2174/138955707780619635|url=}}</ref>
