In [[medicine]], '''laryngospasm''' is an uncontrolled/involuntary muscular contraction ([[muscle spasm|spasm]]) of the [[laryngeal cord]]s. The condition typically lasts less than 60 seconds, and causes a partial blocking of breathing in, while breathing out remains easier. It may be triggered when the vocal cords or the area of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] below the cords detects the entry of water, mucus, blood, or other substance.  It is characterized by [[stridor]] and/or retractions. Some people suffer from frequent laryngospasms, whether awake or asleep. In an ear, nose and throat practice, it is typically seen in people who have [[Laryngopharyngeal reflux|silent reflux disease]]. It is also a well known, infrequent, but serious [[perioperative]] complication.

==Etiology==
In some individuals this can occur spontaneously or as a result of reflux or impaired swallowing.  GERD is a common cause of spontaneous laryngospasm.  Treating GERD can lessen the frequency of spasms.  The onset of spasms may be caused by a viral infection.

It is also a complication associated with [[anesthesia]].  The spasm can happen often without any provocation, but tends to occur after [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] [[extubation]]. In children, the condition can be particularly deadly, leading to cardiac arrest within 30–45 seconds, and is a possible cause of death associated with the induction of general anesthesia in the pediatric population.

==Treatment==
Minor laryngospasm will generally resolve spontaneously.

Laryngospasm in the operating room is treated by [[hyperextension|hyperextending]] the patient's neck and administering assisted ventilation with 100% [[oxygen]].  In more severe cases it may require the administration of an [[intravenous]] [[muscle relaxant]], such as [[Succinylcholine]], and  [[intubation|reintubation]]. 

In ear, nose and throat practices, it is treated by examining the patient in the office and reassuring the patient that laryngospasm resolves.  Sometimes [[reflux]] medication is used to reduce the acidity in the stomach.

Spontaneous laryngospasm can be treated by staying calm and breathing slowly, instead of gasping for air.  Drinking water to wash away any irritants that may be the cause of the spasm can also help greatly.

Patients who are prone to laryngospasm during illness can take measures to prevent irritation such as antacids to avoid acid reflux, and constantly drinking water or tea keep the area clear of irritants.

Additionally, laryngospasms can result from [[hypocalcemia]], causing muscle [[spasms]] and/or [[tetany]]. [[Na+ channel]]s remain open even if there is very little increase in the [[membrane potential]]. This affects the small muscles of the [[vocal cords]].
