'''Apollonius''' was the name of several [[physician]]s in the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]:

*'''Apollonius Antiochenus''', (or '''Apollonius of Antioch'''), was the name of two physicians, father and son, who were born at [[Antioch]], and belonged to the [[Empiric school]]. They lived after [[Serapion of Alexandria]], and before [[Menodotus of Nicomedia|Menodotus]], and therefore lived in the 2nd or 1st century BC.<ref>Galen, ''Introd.'', c. 4. vol. xiv.</ref> One of them is probably the physician called Apollonius Empiricus; the other may be Apollonius Senior.
*'''Apollonius Archistrator''', was the author of a medical prescription quoted by [[Andromachus (physician)|Andromachus]],<ref>ap. Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam. sec. Gen.'', v. 12, vol. xiii.</ref> and must therefore have lived in or before the 1st century BC. Nothing is known about the events of his life.
*'''Apollonius Biblas''', lived probably in the 2nd century BC, and wrote, after [[Zeno (physician)|Zeno]]'s death, a book in answer to a work he composed on the meaning of certain marks (''charakteres'') that are found at the end of some chapters in the third book of the ''Epidemics'' of [[Hippocrates]].<ref>Galen, ''Comm. II, in Hippocr. Epid. III.'', 5, vol. xvii.</ref> It seems likely that he is not the same person as Apollonius Empiricus. His name is probably connected with the word ''bibliakos'', and suggests that he was a "[[book worm]]".
*'''Apollonius Cittensis''', (or '''Apollonius of Citium'''), 1st century BC, the oldest commentator on Hippocrates whose works are still extant. ''See [[Apollonius of Citium]]''.
*'''Apollonius Claudius''', must have lived in or before the 2nd century AD, as one of his antidotes is quoted by [[Galen]].<ref>Galen, ''De Antid.'', ii. 11, vol. xiv.</ref> Nothing is known of his life.
*'''Apollonius Cyprius''', (or '''Apollonius of Cyprus'''), was the pupil of [[Olympicus]], and the tutor to [[Julianus]]. He was a native of [[Cyprus]], belonged to the [[Methodic school]], and probably lived in the 1st century AD.<ref>Galen, ''De Meth. Med.'', i. 7, vol. x.</ref> Nothing more is known of his life.
*'''Apollonius Empiricus''', perhaps one of the physicians called Apollonius Antiochenus. He lived, according to [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]],<ref>Celsus, ''De Med.'', i. praef.</ref> after [[Serapion of Alexandria]], and before [[Heraclides of Tarentum]], and therefore probably lived in the 2nd century BC. He belonged to the [[Empiric school]], and like Apollonius Biblas, wrote a book in answer to [[Zeno (physician)|Zeno]]'s work on the marks (''charakteres'') in [[Hippocrates]]. This was answered by Zeno, and it was this second work that drew from Apollonius Biblas his treatise on the subject after Zeno's death.<ref>Galen, ''Comm. II. in Hipp. Epid. III.'', 5, vol. xvii.</ref> He is also mention by [[Galen]].<ref>Galen, ''De Meth. Med.'', ii. 7, vol. x.</ref>
*'''Apollonius Glaucus''', must have lived in or before the 2nd century AD, as his work ''On Internal Diseases'' is quoted by [[Caelius Aurelianus]].<ref>Caelius Aurelianus, ''De Morb. Chron.'', iv. 8</ref> Nothing is known of his life.
*'''Apollonius Herophileius''', is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Mus. He wrote a phamaceutical work entitled ''Peri Euporiston'', ({{lang-la|De Facile Parabilibus}}),<ref>Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam. sec. Loc.'', vi. 9, vol. xii.</ref> and of which some fragments are quoted in Cramer's ''Anecd. Graeca Paris'', as still existing in manuscript in the [[Royal Library]] in [[Paris]]. He lived earlier than [[Andromachus (physician)|Andromachus]] who quotes him,<ref>ap Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam.'' sec. Loc., vol. xiii.</ref> and also before [[Archigenes]];<ref>Galen, ibid., vol. xii.</ref> hence he may have lived in or before the 1st century BC. He was a follower of [[Herophilus]], and is said by [[Galen]] to have lived for some time at [[Alexandria]]. His work, ''Peri Myron'', ''On Ointments'', is quoted by [[Athenaeus]],<ref>Athenaeus, xv. 688</ref> and he is also mentioned by [[Caelius Aurelianus]].<ref>Caelius Aurelianus, ''De Morb. Acut.'', ii. 28</ref>
*'''Apollonius Hippocraticus''', is said by [[Galen]],<ref>Galen, ''De Secta Opt.'', c. 14, vol. i.; ''Comment. III. in Hippocr. De Rat. Vict. in Morb. Ac.'', c. 38, vol. xv.</ref> to have been a pupil of [[Hippocrates]], and must therefore have lived in the 4th century BC. He is blamed by [[Erasistratus]] for his excessive severity in restricting the quantity of drink allowed to his patients.<ref>Erasistratus ap. Galen, ''l. c.''</ref>
*'''Apollonius Memphites''' (or '''Apollonius of Memphis'''), was born at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in [[Egypt]], and was a follower of Erasistratus.<ref>Galen, ''Introd.'', c. 10, vol. xiv.</ref> He must therefore have lived around the 3rd century BC, and is probably the same person as Apollonius Stratonicus. He wrote a work ''On the Names of the Parts of the Human Body'',<ref>Galen, ''l. c.'', and ''Definit.'', prooem., vol. xix.</ref> and is quoted by [[Erotianus]],<ref>Erotianus, ''Gloss. Hipp.''</ref> [[Galen]],<ref>Galen, ''De Antid. ii.'', 14, vol. xiv.</ref> [[Nicolaus Myrepsus]],<ref>Nicolaus Myrepaus, ''De Aur.'', cc. 11, 16</ref> and other ancient writers.
*'''Apollonius Mus''', a follower of [[Herophilus]]. Nothing is known about his life, but he must have lived in the 1st century BC, as [[Strabo]] mentions him as a contemporary.<ref>Strabo, xiv. 1</ref> He was a fellow-pupil of [[Heraclides of Erythrae]], and composed a long work on the opinions of the sect founded by [[Herophilus]].<ref>Caelius Aurelianus, ''De Morb. Acut.'', ii. 13; Galen, ''De Differ. Puls.'', iv. 10, vol. viii.</ref> He also wrote on [[pharmacy]],<ref>Celsus, ''De Med.'', v. praef; Pallad. ''Comm. in Hipp. Epid. VI''; Galen, ''De Antid.'', ii. 7, 8, vol. xiv.</ref> and is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Herophileius.
*'''Apollonius Ophis''', is said by [[Erotianus]],<ref>Erotianus, ''Gloss. Hipp.''</ref> to have made a compilation from the Glossary of difficult Hippocratic words by [[Bacchius of Tanagra|Bacchius]]; he must therefore have lived about the 2nd or 1st century BC. He may be the same person as Apollonius Pergamenus, or Apollonius Ther.
*'''Apollonius Organicus''', is quote by [[Galen]],<ref>Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam. sec. Loc.'', v. 15, vol. xiii.</ref> and must therefore have lived in or before the 2nd century AD. Nothing is known of his life.
*'''Apollonius Pergamenus''' (or '''Apollonius of Pergamon'''), is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Ophis, or Apollonius Ther. He was born at [[Pergamon]] in [[Mysia]], but his date is uncertain; he is quoted by [[Oribasius]], and must have lived before the 4th century AD.<ref>Oribasius, ''Eupor. ad Eun.'', i. 9</ref> He is probably the author of a long extract on Scarification preserved by Oribasius.<ref>Oribasius, ''Med. Coll.'', vii. 19, 20</ref>
*'''Apollonius Pitaneus''' (or '''Apollonius of Pitane'''), was born at [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]] in [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], and must have lived in to before the 1st century AD, as an absurd and superstitious remedy is attributed to him by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].<ref>Pliny, ''H. N.'', xxix. 38</ref>
*'''Apollonius Senior''', is quoted by [[Erotianus]],<ref>Erotianus, ''Gloss. Hipp.''</ref> and must therefore have lived in or before the 1st century AD. He may be one of the physicians called Apollonius Antiochenus.
*'''Apollonius Stratonicus''', was probably not the son, but the pupil, of [[Strato of Beryta]]. He is likely the same person as Apollonius Memphites, and may have lived about the 3rd century BC. He was a follower of [[Erasistratus]], and wrote a work on the Pulse, which is quoted by [[Galen]].<ref>Galen, ''De Differ. Puls.'', iv. 17, vol. viii.</ref>
*'''Apollonius Tarensis''' (or '''Apollonius of Tarsus'''), was born at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in [[Cilicia]], and lived perhaps in the 1st or 2nd century AD. His prescriptions are several times quoted by Galen.<ref>Galen, ''De Compos. Medicam. sec. Gen.'', v. 13, vol. xiii.</ref>
*'''Apollonius Ther''', is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Ophis or Apollonius Pergamenus. He is quoted by [[Erotianus]],<ref>Erotianus, ''Gloss. Hipp.''</ref> and must have lived in or before the 1st century AD.

Another physician of this name, who is mentioned by [[Apuleius]],<ref>Apuleis, ''Met.'', ix. init.</ref> as having been bitten by a [[mad dog]], must (if he ever really existed) have lived in the 2nd century AD. The name occurs in several ancient authors, belonging to one or more physicians, without any distinguishing [[epithet]].
