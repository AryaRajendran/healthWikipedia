The disorder was originally described by John Hans Menkes (1928&ndash;2008) ''et al.'' in 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Menkes JH, Alter M, Steigleder GK, Weakley DR, Sung JH | title=A sex-linked recessive disorder with retardation of growth, peculiar hair, and focal cerebral and cerebellar degeneration | journal=Pediatrics | year=1962 | pages=764–779 | volume=29  | pmid=14472668}}</ref>

==Characteristics==

[[File:Menkes disease3.jpg|thumb|Microscopic examination of hair, revealing classical sign of ''[[pili torti]]''. From Datta et al., 2008.]]MNK is characterized by growth failure, and deterioration of the nervous system. Onset of Menkes syndrome typically begins during infancy. Signs and symptoms of this disorder include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, mental retardation, and developmental delay. The patients have brittle hair and [[metaphyseal]] widening. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood and are less severe. Affected infants may be [[born prematurely]]. Symptoms appear during infancy and are largely a result of abnormal intestinal copper absorption with secondary deficiency in copper-dependent [[mitochondrial]] enzymes. Normal or slightly slowed development may proceed for 2 to 3 months, and then there will be severe [[developmental delay]] and a loss of early developmental skills. Menkes Disease is also characterized by [[seizure]]s, [[failure to thrive]], [[subnormal body temperature]], and strikingly peculiar hair, which is kinky, colorless or steel-colored, and easily broken. There can be extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Barnes N, Tsivkovskii R, Tsivkovskaia N, Lutsenko S | title=The copper-transporting ATPases, menkes and wilson disease proteins, have distinct roles in adult and developing cerebellum | journal=J Biol Chem | year=2005 | pages=9640–5 | volume=280 | issue=10  | pmid=15634671 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M413840200}}</ref> Arteries in the brain can also be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones ([[osteoporosis]]) may result in fractures.

[[Occipital horn syndrome]] (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa or Ehlers-Danlos type 9<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1180460-overview</ref>), is a mild form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.

==Cause and Genetics==
[[Mutation]]s in the ''[[ATP7A]]'' [[gene]], located on [[chromosome]] [[sex chromosome|Xq21.1]],<ref>{{OMIM|300011}}</ref> are the cause of Menkes syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Voskoboinik I, Camakaris J | title=Menkes copper-translocating P-type ATPase (ATPTA): biochemical and cell biology properties, and role in Menkes disease | journal=J Bioenerg Biomembr | year=2002 | pages=363–71 | volume=34 | issue=5  | pmid=12539963 | doi=10.1023/A:1021250003104}}</ref> This condition is inherited in an [[X-linked recessive]] pattern.<ref name="pmid12221109">{{cite journal |author=Kim BE, Smith K, Meagher CK, Petris MJ |title=A conditional mutation affecting localization of the Menkes disease copper ATPase. Suppression by copper supplementation |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=277 |issue=46 |pages=44079–84 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12221109 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M208737200 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12221109}}</ref> As the result of a mutation in the ''ATP7A'' gene, copper is poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the [[small intestine]] and [[kidney]]s, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing [[enzyme]]s that are necessary for the structure and function of [[bone]], [[skin]], [[hair]], [[blood vessel]]s and the [[nervous system]] such as lysyl oxidase.

==Diagnosis and Treatment==
Urine [[homovanillic acid]]/[[vanillylmandelic acid]] ratio has been proposed as a screening tool to support earlier detection.<ref name="pmid15702409">{{cite journal |author=Matsuo M, Tasaki R, Kodama H, Hamasaki Y |title=Screening for Menkes disease using the urine HVA/VMA ratio |journal=J.
