The '''superior gluteal nerve''' is a [[nerve]] that originates in the [[pelvis]] and supplies the [[gluteus medius]], the [[gluteus minimus]], and the [[tensor fasciae latae]] muscles.<ref name="Platzer-420">Platzer (2004), p 420</ref>

==Structure==
The superior gluteal nerve originates in the [[sacral plexus]].  It arises from the dorsal divisions of the fourth and fifth lumbar and first [[sacral nerve]]s.<ref name="Gray's Anatomy for Students">''Gray's Anatomy for Students'' Drake et al.</ref>
It leaves the pelvis through the [[greater sciatic foramen]] above the [[piriformis]], accompanied by the [[superior gluteal artery]] and the [[superior gluteal vein]].<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-476">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 476</ref>
It then accompanies the upper branch of the deep division of the [[superior gluteal artery]] and ends in the [[gluteus minimus]] and [[tensor fasciae latae muscle]].

==Pathology==
In normal gait, the small gluteal muscles on the stance side can stabilize the pelvis in the [[coronal plane]].  Weakness or paralysis of these muscles caused by a damaged superior gluteal nerve can result in a weak abduction in the affected hip joint.
This [[gait disturbance]] is known as [[Trendelenburg gait]].  In a positive [[Trendelenburg's sign]] the pelvis sags toward the normal unsupported side (the swing leg).  The opposite, when the pelvis is elevated on the swing side, is known as [[Duchenne de Boulogne|Duchenne]] limp.  Bilateral loss of the small gluteal muscles results in a [[Myopathic gait|waddling gait]].
