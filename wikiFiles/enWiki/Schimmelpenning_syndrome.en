'''Schimmelpenning syndrome''' is a neurocutaneous condition characterized by one or more sebaceous nevi, usually appearing on the face or scalp,<ref name='Menascu'>{{Cite journal | last1=Menascu | first1=Shay | last2=Donner | first2=Elizabeth J. | title=Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: case reports and review of the literature | journal=Pediatric Neurology | volume=38 | issue=3 | pages=207 | year=2008 | issn=0887-8994 | pmid=18279757 | doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2007.10.012}}</ref> associated with anomalies of the central nervous system, ocular system, skeletal system, cardiovascular system, and genitourinary system.<ref name='Eisen Part 2'>{{Cite journal | last1=Eisen | first1=D.B. | last2=Michael | first2=D.J. | title= Sebaceous lesions and their associated syndromes: Part II | journal= Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume=61 | issue=4 | pages=563–78 | year=2009 | issn= 0190-9622 | doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.04.059 | pmid=19751880}}</ref>

Synonyms include: "Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS)," "Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome," "Feuerstein-Mims syndrome," "sebaceous nevus syndrome," "Solomon syndrome," and "Jadassohn's nevus phakomatosis." "Nevus" is sometimes spelled "naevus" and "sebaceous" may also be spelled "sebaceus." "[[Epidermal nevus syndrome]]" is sometimes used as a synonym, but more often as a broader term referring to Schimmelpenning syndrome in addition to [[nevus comedonicus syndrome]], [[CHILD syndrome]], Becker’s nevus syndrome, and [[phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica]] .<ref name='Rook'>{{Cite book | editor-last=Burns | editor-first=Tony | title=Rook’s Textbook of Dermatology | edition=7th | publisher=Blackwell Science | year=2004 | location=Malden, Mass. | pages=15.26 | isbn=0-632-06429-3}}</ref>

==Symptoms==

Since the original identification of Schimmelpenning syndrome, the number of findings has expanded to the point that the syndrome is associated with a considerable constellation of abnormalities.<ref name="Eisen Part 2"/>  The abnormalities may occur in a variety of combinations, and need not include all three aspects of the classic triad of sebaceous nevus, seizures and mental retardation.  In 1998, a literature review by van de Warrenburg et al. found:
:*  seizures in 67% of cases
:*  mental retardation in 61% of cases
:*  ophthalmological abnormalities in 59% of cases
:*  involvement of other organ systems in 61% of cases
:*  structural abnormality of cerebrum or cranium in 72% of cases<ref name='Warrenburg'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0303-8467(98)00012-2|title=The linear naevus sebaceus syndrome|journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery|year=1998|first=B.P.|last=van de Warrenburg|coauthors=S. van Gulik, W.O.

The major ocular abnormalities are colobomas and choristomas.<ref name="Harper"/>

Skeletal abnormalities may include dental irregularities, scoliosis, vitamin D-resistant rickets and hypophosphatemia. Cardiovascular abnormalities include ventricular septal defect and co-arctation of the aorta; urinary system issues include horseshoe kidney and duplicated urinary collection system.<ref name="Eisen Part 2"/>

==Genetic Basis==

Schimmelpenning syndrome appears to be sporadic rather than inherited, in almost all cases.<ref name="Eisen Part 2"/>  It is thought to result from genetic mosaicism, possibly an autosomal dominant mutation arising after conception and present only in a subpopulation of cells.  The earlier in embryological development such a mutation occurs, the more extensive the nevi are likely to be and the greater the likelihood of other organ system involvement.<ref name="Neurocutaneous">

==Management==

In general, children with a small isolated nevus and a normal physical exam do not need further testing;<ref name="Neurocutaneous"/>  treatment may include potential surgical removal of the nevus.<ref name='Eisen Part 1'>{{cite journal|title=Sebaceous lesions and their associated syndromes: Part I|journal=J Am Acad Dermatol|year=2009|first=DB|last=Eisen|coauthors=DJ Michael|volume=61|issue=4|pages=549–60|doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.04.058|url=|format=|accessdate=|pmid=19751879}}</ref>  If syndrome issues are suspected, neurological, ocular, and skeletal exams are important.  Laboratory investigations may include serum and urine calcium and phosphate, and possibly liver and renal function tests.  The choice of imaging studies depends on the suspected abnormalities and might include skeletal survey, CT scan of the head, MRI, and/or EEG.<ref name="Neurocutaneous"/>

Depending on the systems involved, an individual with Schimmelpenning syndrome may need to see an interdisciplinary team of specialists: dermatologist, neurologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedic surgeon, oral surgeon, plastic surgeon, psychologist.<ref name="Neurocutaneous"/>
