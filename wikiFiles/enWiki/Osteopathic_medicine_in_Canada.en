'''Osteopathic medicine in Canada''' refers to [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians educated in the United States]], receiving the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree, who practise osteopathic medicine in [[Canada]].  Though licensure requirements for physicians varies by province in Canada, osteopathic physicians are generally able to obtain a license to practise medicine throughout the country. The [[Canadian Osteopathic Association]] is the largest association of osteopathic physicians in Canada.

[[Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine]] (DOs) are educated in the United States and should not be confused with non-physician osteopaths. Currently, there are ''no'' colleges of osteopathic medicine in Canada. Only graduates of [[Template:Osteopathic medical schools|U.S. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine]] are eligible for [[licensure]] to practise [[Osteopathic Medicine]] in Canada. US-trained DOs may practise in Canada as fully licensed physicians. The authority for licensure of American osteopathic graduates lies with the provincial Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons.<ref>[http://osteopathic.ca/Osteopathic%20Practice%20in%20Canada.doc Canadian Osteopathic Practice (.doc)]</ref><ref>[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_91m30_e.htm  Ontario Medicine Act â€“ Restricted Titles, Section 9]</ref><ref>College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario [http://www.cpso.on.ca/policies/policies/default.aspx?ID=1654 Doctor of Osteopathy Registration Policy Statement]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bylaws|url=https://www.cpsbc.ca/files/u6/HPA-Bylaws.pdf|publisher=College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Medical Profession Act: Sections 3 and 18|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/rsa-2000-c-m-11/latest/rsa-2000-c-m-11.html|publisher=Federation of Law Societies of Canada|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/H07.CFM Use of Titles] Albert Health Professions Act Schedule 21</ref>

==Canadian Osteopathic Medical Students==
The [[Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine]] investigated the possibility of opening an osteopathic medical school in Canada. The plans have been dropped, due to concerns about clinical training in a country with very few D.O.s and the large time investment required to open the school.<ref name=Pilot>{{cite news|last=Schierhorn|first=Carolyn|title=MSUCOM pilot program targets Canadian students for training|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=80661|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=[[The DO]]|date=Nov. 21, 2011}}</ref> The college has opened a program at its existing osteopathic school that will accept 25 students from Canada each year.<ref name=Pilot /> About 20 U.S.-trained osteopathic physicians are currently practicing in Canada.<ref name=Pilot />
