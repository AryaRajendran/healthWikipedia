A '''cerebral hemorrhage''' or '''haemorrhage''' (or '''intracerebral hemorrhage''', '''ICH''') is a subtype of [[intracranial hemorrhage]] that occurs within the [[brain tissue]] itself.  Intracerebral hemorrhage can be caused by [[acquired brain injury|brain trauma]], or it can occur spontaneously in [[hemorrhagic stroke]].  Non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage is a spontaneous bleeding into the brain tissue.<ref name="Yadav07"/>


A cerebral hemorrhage is an '''intra-axial hemorrhage'''; that is, it occurs within the brain tissue rather than outside of it.  The other category of intracranial hemorrhage is extra-axial hemorrhage, such as [[epidural haematoma|epidural]], [[subdural hematoma|subdural]], and [[subarachnoid hematoma]]s, which all occur within the skull but outside of the brain tissue.  There are two main kinds of intra-axial hemorrhages: [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] and [[intraventricular hemorrhages]]. As with other types of hemorrhages within the skull, intraparenchymal bleeds are a serious [[medical emergency]] because they can increase [[intracranial pressure]], which if left untreated can lead to [[coma]] and death.  The [[mortality rate]] for intraparenchymal bleeds is over 40%.<ref name="Sanders and McKenna">Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001. Mosby’s Paramedic Textbook, 2nd revised Ed.  Chapter 22, "Head and Facial Trauma." Mosby.</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients with intraparenchymal bleeds have symptoms that correspond to the functions controlled by the area of the brain that is damaged by the bleed.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis">Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2888.htm "Penetrating Head Trauma."] Emedicine.com.</ref>  Other symptoms include those that indicate a rise in [[intracranial pressure]] due to a large mass putting pressure on the brain.<ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/>
Intracerebral hemorrhages are often misdiagnosed as [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]s due to the similarity in symptoms and signs. A severe headache followed by vomiting is one of the more common symptoms of intracerebral hemorrhage. Some patients may also go into a coma before the bleed is noticed..

==Causes==

Amyloid angiopathy is a not uncommon cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients over the age of 55. A very small proportion is due to [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]].  Infection with the ''k'' serotype of ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' may also be a risk factor, due to its prevalence in stroke patients and production of [[collagen-binding protein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v2/n9/full/ncomms1491.html|title=The collagen-binding protein of Streptococcus mutans is involved in haemorrhagic stroke|author=Kazuhiko Nakano ''et al.''|publisher=Nature Communications|volume=2}}</ref>

Tramautic intracerebral Hematomas are divided into acute and delayed. Acute intracerebral Hematomas occur at the time of the injury while delayed intracerebral Hematomas have been reported from as early as 6 hours post injury to as long as several weeks. It is important to keep in mind that intracerebral Hematomas can be delayed because if symptoms begin to appear several weeks after the injury, concussion is no longer considered and the symptoms may not be connected to the injury.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Intracerebral hemorrhage.jpg|thumb|Spontaneous ICH with [[hydrocephalus]] on CT scan<ref name="Yadav07"/>]]
[[Intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] can be recognized on [[CT scan]]s because blood appears brighter than other tissue and is separated from the inner table of the skull by brain tissue. The tissue surrounding a bleed is often less dense than the rest of the brain due to [[edema]], and therefore shows up darker on the CT scan.
Frequently, a CT angiogram will be performed in order to exclude a secondary cause of hemorrhage or to detect a "spot sign".

==Treatment==
Treatment depends substantially of the type of ICH. Rapid [[CT scan]] and other diagnostic measures are used to determine proper treatment, which may include both medication and surgery.

===Medication===
*[[Antihypertensive therapy]] in acute phases. The AHA/ASA and EUSI guidelines (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines and the European Stroke Initiative guidelines) have recommended antihypertensive therapy to stabilize the [[mean arterial pressure]] at 110 mmHg. One paper showed the efficacy of this antihypertensive therapy without worsening outcome in patients of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage within 3 hours onset.<ref>Fujii M et al. J Clin Neurosci 17:1136-9,2010 PMID 20541417</ref>
*Giving [[Factor VII]]a within 4 hours limits the bleeding and formation of a [[hematoma]]. However, it also increases the risk of [[thromboembolism]].<ref name=emedicine>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1163977-treatment eMedicine Specialties > Neurology > Neurological Emergencies > Intracranial Haemorrhage: Treatment & Medication.] By David S Liebeskind, MD. Updated: Aug 7, 2006</ref>
*[[Mannitol]] is effective in acutely reducing raised intracranial pressure.
*[[Acetaminophen]] may be needed to avoid [[hyperthermia]], and to relieve headache.<ref name=emedicine/>
*Frozen plasma, [[vitamin K]], [[protamine]], or [[platelet transfusion]]s are given in case of a [[coagulopathy]].<ref name=emedicine/>
*[[Fosphenytoin]] or other [[anticonvulsant]] is given in case of [[seizures]] or lobar hemorrhage.<ref name=emedicine/>
*H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are commonly given for stress ulcer prophylaxis, a condition somehow linked with ICH.<ref name=emedicine/>
*[[Corticosteroids]], in concert with antihypertensives, reduces swelling.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000796.htm MedlinePlus - Intracerebral haemorrhage] Update Date: 7/14/2006. Updated by: J.A. Lee, M.D.</ref>

===Surgery===
Surgery is required if the [[hematoma]] is greater than {{convert|3|cm|0|abbr=on}}, if there is a structural [[vascular]] [[lesion]] or [[lobe (anatomy)|lobar]] [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] in a young patient.<ref name=emedicine/> 

*A [[catheter]] may be passed into the brain [[vasculature]] to close off or dilate [[blood vessel]]s, avoiding invasive surgical procedures.<ref>[http://www.csmc.edu/2424.html Cedars-Sinai Health System - Cerebral Hemorrhages] Retrieved on 02/25/2009</ref>
*Aspiration by [[stereotactic surgery]] or [[endoscopic]] drainage may be used in [[basal ganglia]] hemorrhages, although successful reports are limited.<ref name=emedicine/>

===Other treatment===
*[[Tracheal intubation]] is indicated in patients with decreased level of consciousness or other risk of airway obstruction.<ref name=emedicine/>
*[[Intravenous_therapy#IV_fluids|IV fluids]] are given to maintain [[fluid balance]], using normotonic rather than hypotonic fluids.<ref name=emedicine/>

==Prognosis==
The risk of death from an intraparenchymal bleed in traumatic brain injury is especially low when the injury occurs in the [[brain stem]].<ref name="Sanders and McKenna"/> Intraparenchymal bleeds within the [[medulla oblongata]] are almost always fatal, because they cause damage to cranial nerve X, the [[vagus nerve]], which plays an important role in [[blood circulation]] and breathing.<ref name="McCaffrey"/>  This kind of hemorrhage can also occur in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] or subcortical areas, usually in the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] or [[temporal lobe]]s when due to head injury, and sometimes in the [[cerebellum]].<ref name="McCaffrey"/><ref name="Graham and Gennareli ">Graham DI and Gennareli TA.  Chapter 5, "Pathology of Brain Damage After Head Injury"  Cooper P and Golfinos G.  2000.  ''Head Injury'', 4th Ed. Morgan Hill, New York.</ref>

For spontaneous ICH seen on CT scan, the death rate ([[mortality rate|mortality]]) is 34–50% by 30&nbsp;days after the insult,<ref name="Yadav07"/> and half of the deaths occur in the first 2 days.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/17775643/ICH-Management.html Guidelines for the Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Adults]</ref>

The inflammatory response triggered by stroke has been viewed as harmful in the early stage, focusing on blood-borne leukocytes, neutrophils and macrophages, and resident microglia and astrocytes.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20713126] Wang J.: Preclinical and clinical research on inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage</ref> 
New area of interest are the Mast Cells.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v30/n4/abs/jcbfm2009282a.html] Lindsberg e.a.: Mast cells as early responders in the regulation of acute blood–brain barrier changes after cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage</ref>

==Epidemiology==
It accounts for 20% of all cases of [[cerebrovascular disease]] in the US, behind [[cerebral thrombosis]] (40%) and [[cerebral embolism]] (30%).<ref>Page 117 in: {{cite book |author=Henry S. Schutta; Lechtenberg, Richard |title=Neurology practice guidelines |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-8247-0104-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

It is two or more times more prevalent in [[Black people|black]] patients than it is in [[White people|white]] patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Copenhaver BR, Hsia AW, Merino JG, ''et al.'' |title=Racial differences in microbleed prevalence in primary intracerebral hemorrhage |journal=Neurology |volume=71 |issue=15 |pages=1176–82 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18838665 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000327524.16575.ca |url= |pmc=2676986}}</ref>
