'''Paraproteinemia''', or '''monoclonal gammopathy''', is the presence of excessive amounts of a single [[monoclonal]] [[gammaglobulin]] (in this case denominated "paraprotein") in the [[blood]]. It is usually due to an underlying [[immunoproliferative disorder]].

It is sometimes considered equivalent to [[plasma cell dyscrasia]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000078543|paraproteinemia}}</ref>

==Types==
Paraproteinemias may be categorized according to the type of monoclonal protein found in blood:

* '''[[Light chain]]s''' only (or [[Bence Jones protein]]).  This may be associated with [[multiple myeloma]] or [[AL amyloidosis]].
* '''[[Heavy chain]]s''' only (also known as "[[heavy chain disease]]");
* '''Whole [[immunoglobulin]]s'''.  In this case, the paraprotein goes under the name of "M-protein" ("M" for monoclonal). If immunoglobulins tend to precipitate within blood vessels with cold, that phenomenon takes the name of [[cryoglobulinaemia]].

The three types of paraproteins may occur alone or in combination in a given individual. Note that while most heavy chains or whole immunoglobulins remain within blood vessels, light chains frequently escape and are excreted by the kidneys into urine, where they take the name of [[Bence Jones protein]].

It is also possible for paraproteins (usually whole immunoglobulins) to form [[polymer]]s by aggregating with each other; this takes the name of [[macroglobulinemia]] and may lead to further complications. For example, certain macroglobulins tend to precipitate within blood vessel with cold, a phenomenon known as [[cryoglobulinemia]]. Others may make blood too viscous to flow smoothly (usually with IgM macroglobulins), a phenomenon known as  [[Waldenström macroglobulinemia]].

==Possible causes==
* [[Leukemia]]s and [[lymphoma]]s of various types, but usually B-cell [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]s with a plasma cell component.
** [[Myeloma]]
** [[Plasmacytoma]]
** [[Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma]]

* Idiopathic (no discernible cause): some of these will be revealed as leukemias or lymphomas over the years.
** [[Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance]]
** Primary AL [[amyloidosis]] (light chains only)

== Diagnosis ==

These disorders are characterized by the presence of any abnormal protein that is involved in the immune system, which are most often immunoglobulins and are associated with the clonal proliferation of lymphocytes.<ref name="item5">Health Communication Network.

When a paraproteinemia is present in the blood, there will be a narrow band, or spike, in the serum protein electrophoresis because there will be an excess of production of one protein.<ref name="item6">{{cite journal |author=Ma ES, Lee ET |title=A case of IgM paraproteinemia in which serum free light chain values were within reference intervals |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=362–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17259251 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2006.080317 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17259251}}</ref> 

There are two large classes of blood proteins: [[albumin]] and [[globulin]]. They are generally equal in proportion, but albumin is much smaller than globulin, and slightly negatively charged, which leads to an accumulation at the end of the electrophoretic gel. The globulins separate out into three regions on the electrophoretic gel, which are the α band, the β band, and the γ band. 

* The α band can be separated into two components: α1 and α2. The α1 region consists mostly of α1-[[antitrypsin]] and α1-[[acid glycoprotein]]. The α2 region is mostly [[haptoglobin]], α2-[[macroglobulin]], α2-[[antiplasmin]] and [[ceruloplasmin]].

* The β band consists of [[transferrin]], [[low-density lipoproteins]], and [[complement system]] proteins.<ref name="item7">{{cite journal |author=Martínez-Gómez MA, Carril-Avilés MM, Sagrado S, Villanueva-Camañas RM, Medina-Hernández MJ |title=Characterization of antihistamine-human serum protein interactions by capillary electrophoresis |journal=J Chromatogr A |volume=1147 |issue=2 |pages=261–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17339039 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2007.02.054 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021-9673(07)00334-2}}</ref>

* The γ band is where the immunoglobulins appear, which is why they are also known as gammaglobulins.<ref name="item1">Abbas, A.K and Lichtman, A.H. Cellular and Molecular Immunology. Fifth Edition. Elsevier Saunders. Philadelphia. 2005</ref> The majority of paraproteins appear in this band.<ref name="item7" />
