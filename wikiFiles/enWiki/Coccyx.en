:''The [[tortrix moth]] [[genus]] ''Coccyx'' is nowadays considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''[[Cydia (genus)|Cydia]].

The '''coccyx''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|k|s}} {{respell|KOK|siks}}; [[plural]]: '''coccyges'''), commonly referred to as the '''tailbone''', is the final segment of the [[spine (anatomy)|vertebral column]] in [[hominoid|tailless primates]]. Comprising three to five separate or fused [[vertebra]]e (the coccygeal vertebrae) below the [[sacrum]], it is attached to the sacrum by a [[fibrocartilaginous]] [[joint]], the [[sacrococcygeal symphysis]], which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx.

The term ''coccyx'' comes originally from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόκκυξ and means "cuckoo",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dko%2Fkkuc κόκκυξ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> referring to the curved shape of a [[cuckoo]]'s beak when viewed from the side.<ref name="Foye-eMed-CocPain">Foye (2008), eMedicine</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00007632-199502000-00024 | last = Sugar | first = Oscar | title = Historical Perspective Coccyx: The Bone Named for a Bird | journal =Spine | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 379–383 | date = February 1995 | url = http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Citation/1995/02000/Historical_Perspective_Coccyx__The_Bone_Named_for.24.aspx | issn = 0362-2436 | pmid = 7732478}}</ref>

== Function ==
In humans and other tailless [[primates]] (e.g., [[great ape]]s) since ''[[Nacholapithecus]]'' (a [[Miocene]] [[hominoid]]),<ref name="Nakatsukasa-J-Anatomy">Nakatsukasa 2004, ''Acquisition of bipedalism'' (See [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1571308&rendertype=figure&id=fig05 Fig. 5] entitled ''First coccygeal/caudal vertebra in short-tailed or tailless primates.''.)</ref><ref><!-- due to an earlier error -->Note: Nacholapithecus and Nakaliphitecus nakayamai are two different species of Miocene hominoids (specimens from Nakali and Nachola respectively).  See for example "Comparisons with Other Hominoids" in (Kunimatsu, Nakatsukasa ''et al.'' Dec 2007)</ref> the coccyx is the remnant of a [[Human vestigiality#Coccyx|vestigial tail]], but still not entirely useless;<ref name="Saladin-285">Saladin (2003), p 268</ref> it is an important attachment for various muscles, tendons and ligaments—which makes it necessary for physicians and patients to pay special attention to these attachments when considering surgical removal of the coccyx.<ref name="Foye-eMed-CocPain" />  Additionally, it is also a part of the weight-bearing tripod structure which acts as a support for a [[sitting]] person. When a person sits leaning forward, the [[ischial tuberosity|ischial tuberosities]] and [[Inferior ramus of the ischium|inferior rami of the ischium]] take most of the weight, but as the sitting person leans backward, more weight is transferred to the coccyx.<ref name="Foye-eMed-CocPain" />

The anterior side of the coccyx serves for the attachment of a group of muscles important for many functions of the [[pelvic floor]] (i.e., [[defecation]], [[wikt:continence|continence]], etc.): The [[levator ani muscle]], which include [[coccygeus muscle|coccygeus]], [[iliococcygeus muscle|iliococcygeus]], and [[pubococcygeus muscle|pubococcygeus]]. Through the [[Anococcygeal raphe|anococcygeal raphé]], the coccyx supports the position of the [[anus]].  Attached to the posterior side is [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] which extend the [[thigh]] during [[Walking|ambulation]].<ref name="Foye-eMed-CocPain" />

Many important [[ligament]]s attach to the coccyx: The [[anterior sacrococcygeal ligament|anterior]] and [[posterior sacrococcygeal ligament]]s are the continuations of the [[Anterior longitudinal ligament|anterior]] and [[posterior longitudinal ligament]]s that stretches along the entire spine.<ref name="Foye-eMed-CocPain" />  Additionally, the [[lateral sacrococcygeal ligament]]s complete the [[foramina]] for the [[Sacral spinal nerve 5|last sacral nerve]].<ref name="Morris-59">Morris (2005), p 59</ref>  And, lastly, some fibers of the [[sacrospinous ligament|sacrospinous]] and [[sacrotuberous ligament]]s (arising from the [[Ischial spine|spine of the ischium]] and the [[ischial tuberosity]] respectively) also attach to the coccyx.<ref name="Foye-eMed-CocPain" />

An extension of the [[pia mater]], the [[filum terminale]], extends from the apex of the [[conus medullaris|conus]], and inserts on the coccyx.

== Structure ==
The coccyx is usually formed of four rudimentary [[vertebra]]e (sometimes five or three). It articulates superiorly with the [[sacrum]]. In each of the first three segments may be traced a rudimentary body and articular and transverse processes; the last piece (sometimes the third) is a mere nodule of bone. The transverse processes are most prominent and noticeable on the first coccygeal segment.  All the segments are destitute of [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicles]], [[Lamina of the vertebral arch|laminae]] and spinous processes. The first is the largest; it resembles the lowest [[sacral vertebra]], and often exists as a separate piece; the last three diminish in size from above downward.<!--- From Gray's --->

Most anatomy books wrongly state that the coccyx is normally fused in adults. In fact it has been shown<ref name="Postachini">Postachini (1983), pp 1116–1124</ref><ref name="KimSuk">Kim & Suk (1999), pp 215–20</ref> that the coccyx may consist of up to five separate bony segments, the most common configuration being two or three segments.

=== Surfaces ===
The [[anterior]] surface is slightly concave and marked with three transverse grooves that indicate the junctions of the different segments. It gives attachment to the [[anterior sacrococcygeal ligament]] and the [[Levator ani|Levatores ani]] and supports part of the [[rectum]].<!--- From Gray's ---> The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] surface is convex marked by transverse grooves similar to those on the anterior surface, and presents on either side a linear row of tubercles, the rudimentary articular processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. Of these, the superior pair are large, and are called the [[coccygeal cornua]]; they project upward, and articulate with the cornua of the sacrum, and on either side complete the foramen for the transmission of the posterior division of the [[Sacral spinal nerve 5|fifth sacral nerve]].<!--- From Gray's --->

=== Borders ===
The lateral borders are thin and exhibit a series of small eminences, which represent the transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. Of these, the first is the largest; it is flattened from before backward, and often ascends to join the lower part of the thin lateral edge of the sacrum, thus completing the foramen for the transmission of the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve; the others diminish in size from above downward, and are often wanting. The borders of the coccyx are narrow, and give attachment on either side to the [[sacrotuberous ligament|sacrotuberous]] and [[sacrospinous ligament]]s, to the [[Coccygeus muscle|coccygeus]] in front of the ligaments, and to the [[gluteus maximus]] behind them.<!--- From Gray's --->

=== Apex ===
The apex is rounded, and has attached to it the tendon of the [[Sphincter ani externus]]. It may be [[Spina bifida|bifid]].<!--- From Gray's --->

=== Sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal joints ===
The joints are variable and may be: (1) [[synovial joints]]; (2) thin discs of [[fibrocartilage]]; (3) intermediate between these two; (4) ossified.<ref>Maigne ''et al.'' (1992), pp 34–35</ref><ref>Saluja (1988), pp 11–15</ref>

== Pathology ==
Injuring the coccyx can give rise to a painful condition called [[coccydynia]] and one or more of the bones or the connections thereof may be broken, [[coccyx_fracture|fractured tailbone]].<ref name="Maigne">Maigne (2000), pp 3072–3079</ref>
<ref name="Foye-2006">Foye (2006), pp 783–4</ref>  A number of [[tumor]]s are known to involve the coccyx;  of these, the most common is [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]].  Both coccydynia and coccygeal tumors may require surgical removal of the coccyx ([[coccygectomy]]).  One complication of coccygectomy is a [[coccygeal hernia]].<ref name="pmid17889632">Miranda ''et al.'' (2007)</ref> Fortunately, most cases of coccyx pain respond well to nonsurgical treatment, such as medications given by local injection (often done under fluoroscopic guidance).
