==Research==

The National MS Society supports and funds research activities spanning all research stages, including early discovery research, translational research that brings promising ideas forward into actual therapeutic solutions for testing, and clinical trials. This unique approach drives the pursuit of all promising avenues that can impact those living with multiple sclerosis. In 2012, the Society invested $44 million in over 350 new and ongoing projects.

Thanks in large part to the scientific collaboration fostered by the Society, in less than two decades, MS has moved from an untreatable disease to one where there are now nine FDA approved therapies for relapsing MS, the most common form of the disease, and another half dozen in late stage development or already before the FDA for review.
