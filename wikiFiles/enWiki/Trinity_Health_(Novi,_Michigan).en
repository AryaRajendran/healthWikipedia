==Catholic restrictions on services==
A typical member of Trinity Health, Saint Joseph Mercy Health System (SJMHS) of [[Ann Arbor]], says on a Web entry: "As a Catholic organization, SJMHS prohibits its staff from dispensing or prescribing contraceptives and from performing vasectomies, female sterilizations, and elective abortions."<ref>[http://arborweb.com/cg/t0081.html Saint Joseph Mercy Health System - St. Joseph Mercy Hospital ]</ref>

== Health information technology ==
Trinity Health's physicians and nurses use [[computer]]ized clinical tools to automate processes, including:

*  [[Electronic medical records|Health records are stored electronically]], and available wherever there is computer access.

*  Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE): tests and treatments are entered directly into a secure system from where they can be accessed instantly. Orders are marked and checked against a database to ensure accuracy.

*  Care is charted at the bedside with mobile equipment, becoming immediately available.

*  [[Electronic prescribing|Drug alert systems]] provide automatic checks to ensure appropriate medication and dosing, limiting the likelihood of human error. The system checks prescribed medication against lab results and other key information within a patient's electronic health record, such as allergies.

{{As of|2009|1}}, 22 community hospitals within Trinity Health's integrated health delivery network had computerized clinical and revenue-management applications.

== US health reform ==
The organisation carries out advocacy based on the belief that the US health care system should provide everyone with access to health coverage and high-quality care.<ref>[http://www.trinity-health.org/advocacy TH Web site, Advocacy]</ref>

Through its "[http://www.trinity-health.org/ProgramsServices/Advocacy/index.htm Find a Way]" campaign, Trinity Health and its partner organizations contend that health reform is a key ingredient of economic recovery, and that all lawmakers should work urgently toward a goal of "coverage and access for all Americans in a cost-effective system of care."

Trinity Health organises town hall events, visits to Capitol Hill and meetings with local legislators as part of the US health care discussion. Trinity Health president and CEO Joseph R. Swedish issued a call for comprehensive health reform in a column titled "Our Carpe Diem Moment: Execs, Clinicians Must Help Policymakers Find the Way to Universal Coverage", published in [[Modern Healthcare]] on April 28, 2008.

== History ==

Trinity Health was formed by merging Holy Cross Health System and Mercy Health Services in 2000.

Holy Cross Health System has its roots in the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, founded in 1841 by Father Basil Anthony Moreau. During the Civil War, Holy Cross Sisters helped staff military hospitals, caring for the wounded of both North and South. Over the next 100 years, the Sisters opened hospitals and other healthcare facilities throughout the country, responding to the needs of the times. In 1979 Holy Cross Health System was formed to unite the health care organizations sponsored by the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross.

In 1831, Catherine McAuley founded the Sisters of Mercy in Dublin, Ireland. Over the next 10 years, she and her Sisters established 14 foundations to serve the poor, the sick and the uneducated throughout Ireland and England. After McAuley's death in 1841, the Sisters of Mercy took their mission to America, where they founded hospitals, schools, and orphanages, and established homes for women and girls at risk.

The Sisters of Mercy Regional Community of Detroit traces its roots to convents, schools and hospitals founded as early as the 1860s and 1870s in Iowa and Michigan. In 1976, the Sisters created a health system, eventually called Mercy Health Services, to link and better support their hospitals.
