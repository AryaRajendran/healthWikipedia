'''Arsenic contamination of groundwater''' is often due to naturally occurring high concentrations of [[arsenic]] in deeper levels of [[groundwater]].  It is a high-profile problem due to the use of deep [[tubewell]]s for water supply in the [[Ganges Delta]], causing serious [[arsenic poisoning]] to large numbers of people. In addition, mining techniques such as [[hydraulic fracturing]] mobilize arsenic in groundwater and aquifers due to enhanced methane transportation and resulting changes in redox conditions,<ref name="mobile arsenic">Brown, R.A. and Katrina E.

In South America, [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] are affected. There are also many locations in the [[United States]] where the groundwater contains arsenic concentrations in excess of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] standard of 10 parts per billion adopted in 2001. According to a recent film funded by the US [[Superfund]], {{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi5DfRy01vE |title=In Small Doses |format= |work= |accessdate=}}, millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels, and in some areas of the US, over 20% of wells may contain levels that are not safe.

==Health effects of arsenic==
{{main|arsenic poisoning}}
Consuming water contaminated by arsenic can cause [[skin cancer|skin]] and [[bladder cancer|bladder]] cancer,  as well as [[cardiovascular disease]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Some research concludes that even at the lower concentrations, arsenic contamination is a major cause of death.  A study conducted in a contiguous six-county area of southeastern Michigan investigated the relationship between moderate arsenic levels and 23 selected disease outcomes. Disease outcomes included several types of cancer, diseases of the circulatory and respiratory system, diabetes mellitus, and kidney and liver diseases.  Elevated mortality rates were observed for all diseases of the circulatory system.  The researchers acknowledged a need to replicate their findings.<ref>, Jaymie R. Meliker, [http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/4 ''Arsenic in drinking water and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease in Michigan: a standardized mortality ratio analysis''] Environmental Health Magazine. Volume 2:4. 2007. Accessed 9 Sept. 2008.</ref> 

A preliminary study shows a relationship between arsenic exposure measured in urine and Type II diabetes. The results supported the hypothesis that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water may play a role in diabetes prevalence.<ref>Ana Navas-Acien, "Arsenic Exposure and Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes in US Adults," ''Journal of American Medical Association'', v.300, n.7 (August 2008).</ref>

Arsenic in drinking water may also compromise immune function {{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-05/mbl-sli052009.php |title=Scientists link influenza A (H1N1) susceptibility to common levels of arsenic exposure |format= |work= |accessdate=}}.

==Contamination specific nations and regions==
=== Bangladesh and West Bengal, India ===
Arsenic contamination of the groundwater in Bangladesh is a serious problem. Prior to the 1970s, Bangladesh had one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Ineffective water purification and sewage systems as well as periodic monsoons and flooding exacerbated these problems. As a solution, UNICEF and the World Bank advocated the use of wells to tap into deeper groundwater. Millions of wells were constructed as a result. Because of this action, infant mortality and diarrheal illness were reduced by fifty percent. However, with over 8 million wells constructed, approximately one in five of these wells is now contaminated with arsenic above the government's drinking water standard.  

In the [[Ganges Delta]], the affected wells are typically more than 20 m and less than 100 m deep. Groundwater closer to the surface typically has spent a shorter time in the ground, therefore likely absorbing a lower concentration of arsenic; water deeper than 100 m is exposed to much older sediments which have already been depleted of arsenic.<ref>{{cite journal

Criticism has been leveled at the [[Aid agency|aid agencies]], who denied the problem during the 1990s while millions of [[tube well]]s were sunk. The aid agencies later hired foreign experts who recommended treatment plants that were inappropriate to the conditions, were regularly breaking down, or were not removing the arsenic.<ref>[[New Scientist]], [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025450.600-drinking-at-the-wests-toxic-well.html Interview: Drinking at the west's toxic well] 31 May 2006.</ref>

In West Bengal, India, water is mostly supplied from rivers. Groundwater comes from deep tubewells, which are few in number. Because of the low quantity of deep tubewells, the risk of arsenic patients in West Bengal is comparatively less.<ref name=timesofindia>[[The Times of India]], [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/864169.cms 'Use surface water. Stop digging'], interview, 26 Sep, 2004.</ref> According to the World Health Organisation, “In Bangladesh, West Bengal (India), and some other areas most drinking-water used to be collected from open dug wells and ponds with little or no arsenic, but with contaminated water transmitting diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis. Programmes to provide ‘safe’ drinking-water over the past 30 years have helped to control these diseases, but in some areas they have had the unexpected side-effect of exposing the population to another health problem—arsenic.”<ref name=who>[[World Health Organization]], [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs210/en/index.html Arsenic in Drinking Water], accessed 5 Feb 2007.</ref>
The acceptable level as defined by WHO for maximum concentrations of arsenic in safe drinking water is 0.01&nbsp;mg/L. The Bangladesh government's standard is at a slightly higher rate, at 0.05&nbsp;mg/L being considered safe. WHO has defined the areas under threat: Seven of the nineteen districts of West Bengal have been reported to have ground water arsenic concentrations above 0.05&nbsp;mg/L.  The total population in these seven districts is over 34 million while the number using arsenic-rich water is more than 1 million (above 0.05&nbsp;mg/L). That number increases to 1.3 million when the concentration is above 0.01&nbsp;mg/L. According to a British Geological Survey study in 1998 on shallow tube-wells in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh, 46 percent of the samples were above 0.01&nbsp;mg/L and 27 percent were above 0.050&nbsp;mg/L. When combined with the estimated 1999 population, it was estimated that the number of people exposed to arsenic concentrations above 0.05&nbsp;mg/L is 28-35 million and the number of those exposed to more than 0.01&nbsp;mg/L is 46-57 million (BGS, 2000).<ref name=who/>

Throughout Bangladesh, as tube wells get tested for concentrations of arsenic, ones which are found to have arsenic concentrations over the amount considered safe are painted red to warn residents that the water is not safe to drink. 

One solution is “By using surface water and instituting effective withdrawal regulation. West Bengal and Bangladesh are flooded with surface water. We should first regulate proper watershed management. Treat and use available surface water, rain-water, and others. The way we're doing [it] at present is not advisable."<ref name=timesofindia/>

===Argentina===
The central portion of Argentina is affected by arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Specifically, the La Pampa produces water containing 4-5300 microgram As per litre.<ref>P.L. Smedley, D.G.

}}</ref>  Cases of groundwater-caused acute arsenic toxicity, such as those found in Bangladesh, are unknown in the [[United States]] where the concern has focused on the role of arsenic as a [[carcinogen]].  The problem of high arsenic concentrations has been subject to greater scrutiny in recent years{{when?|date=May 2012}} because of changing government standards for arsenic in drinking water.

Some locations in the United States, such as [[Fallon, Nevada]], have long been known to have groundwater with relatively high arsenic concentrations (in excess of 0.08&nbsp;mg/L).<ref>Frederick Rubel Jr. and Steven W. Hathaway (1985) ''Pilot Study for removal of arsenic from drinking water at the Fallon, Nevada, Naval Air Station'', Environmental Protection Agency, EPA/600/S2-85/094.</ref>  Even some surface waters, such as the Verde River in [[Arizona]], sometimes exceed 0.01&nbsp;mg/L arsenic, especially during low-flow periods when the river flow is dominated by groundwater discharge.<ref>M. Taqueer A. Qureshi (1995) ''Sources of Arsenic in the Verde River and Salt River Watersheds, Arizona'', M.S. thesis, Arizona State University, Tempe.</ref>

A drinking water standard of 0.05&nbsp;mg/L (equal to 50 parts per billion, or ppb) arsenic was originally established in the United States by the Public Health Service in 1942.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studied the pros and cons of lowering the arsenic [[Maximum Contaminant Level]] (MCL) for years in the late 1980s and 1990s.  No action was taken until January 2001, when the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration in its final weeks promulgated a new standard of 0.01&nbsp;mg/L (10 ppb) to take effect January 2006.<ref>''The history of arsenic regulation'', Southwest Hydrology, May/June 2002, p.16.</ref>  The incoming [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration suspended the [[midnight regulation]], but after some months of study, the new EPA administrator [[Christine Todd Whitman]] approved the new 10 ppb arsenic standard and its original effective date of January 2006.<ref>''EPA announces arsenic standard for drinking water of 10 parts per billion'', EPA press release, 10/31/2001.</ref>

Many public water supply systems across the United States obtained their water supply from groundwater that had met the old 50 ppb arsenic standard but exceeded the new 10 ppb MCL. These utilities searched for either an alternative supply or an inexpensive treatment method to remove the arsenic from their water.  In Arizona, an estimated 35 percent of water-supply wells were put out of compliance by the new regulation; in California, the percentage was 38 percent .<ref>Alison Bohlen (2002) ''States move forward to meet new arsenic standard'', Southwest Hydrology, May/June 2002, p.18-19.</ref>

The proper arsenic MCL continues to be debated. Some have argued that the 10 ppb federal standard is still too high, while others have argued that 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits;  [[New Jersey]] has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005&nbsp;mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.<ref>Megan A. Ferguson and others, Lowering the detection limit for arsenic: implications for a future practical quantitation limit, [[American Water Works Association]] Journal, Aug. 2007, p.92-98.</ref>

A study of private water wells in the Appalachian mountains found that six percent of the wells had arsenic above the U.S. MCL of 0.010&nbsp;mg/L.<ref>John G. Shiber, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=16437433 "Arsenic in domestic well water and health in Central Appalachia, USA"]</ref>

=== Nepal ===
Nepal is subject to a serious problem with arsenic contamination.  The problem is most severe in the [[Terai]] region,  the worst being near [[Nawalparasi District]], where 26 percent of shallow wells failed to meet WHO standard of 10 ppb.  A study by Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Environment in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] showed that 72% of deep wells failed to meet the WHO standard, and 12% failed to meet the Nepali standard of 50 ppb.<ref>http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/nepal-filters-to-provide-arsenic-free-drinking-water</ref>

A simpler and less expensive form of arsenic removal is known as the [[Sono arsenic filter]], using three pitchers containing cast iron turnings and sand in the first pitcher and wood activated carbon and sand in the second.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.unu.edu/env/Arsenic/Munir.pdf Evaluation of Performance of Sono 3-Kolshi Filter for Arsenic Removal from Groundwater Using Zero Valent Iron Through Laboratory and Field Studies]|272&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 279183 bytes -->}}</ref> Plastic buckets can also be used as filter containers.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://phys4.harvard.edu/~wilson/arsenic/remediation/SONO/As%20filtration%20pictures.pdf SONO ARSENIC FILTER FROM BANGLADESH - 1]|102&nbsp;KiB<!-- application/pdf, 105080 bytes -->}} - pictures with descriptions.</ref> It is claimed that thousands of these systems are in use and can last for years while avoiding the toxic waste disposal problem inherent to conventional arsenic removal plants.  Although novel, this filter has not been certified by any sanitary standards such as NSF, ANSI, WQA and does not avoid toxic waste disposal similar to any other iron removal process.

In the United States small "under the sink" units have been used to remove arsenic from drinking water.  This option is called "point of use" treatment.  The most common types of domestic treatment use the technologies of adsorption (using media such as Bayoxide E33, GFH, or titanium dioxide) or [[reverse osmosis]].  [[Ion exchange]] and [[activated alumina]] have been considered but not commonly used.

===Large-scale water treatment===

In some places, such as the United States, all the water supplied to residences by utilities must meet primary (health-based) drinking water standards.  Regulations may necessitate large-scale treatment systems to remove arsenic from the water supply.  The effectiveness of any method depends on the chemical makeup of a particular water supply.  The aqueous chemistry of arsenic is complex, and may affect the removal rate that can be achieved by a particular process.

Some large utilities with multiple water supply wells could shut down those wells with high arsenic concentrations, and produce only from wells or surface water sources that meet the arsenic standard.  Other utilities, however, especially small utilities with only a few wells, may have no available water supply that meets the arsenic standard.
 
'''Coagulation/filtration''' (also known as [[flocculation#Water_treatment|flocculation]]) removes arsenic by [[coprecipitation]] and adsorption using iron coagulants. Coagulation/filtration using [[alum]] is already used by some utilities to remove suspended solids and may be adjusted to remove arsenic. But the problem of this type of filtration system is that it gets clogged very easily, mostly within two to three months. The toxic arsenic sludge are disposed of by concrete stabilization, but there is no guarantee that they won't leach out in future.

'''[[Iron oxide adsorption]]''' filters the water through a granular medium containing ferric oxide.  Ferric oxide has a high affinity for adsorbing dissolved metals such as arsenic.  The iron oxide medium eventually becomes saturated, and must be replaced. The sludge disposal is a problem here too.

'''[[Activated alumina]]''' is an adsorbent that effectively removes arsenic.  Activated alumina columns connected to shallow tube wells in India and Bangladesh have successfully removed both As(III) and As(V) from groundwater for decades.  Long-term column performance has been possible through the efforts of community-elected water committees that collect a local water tax for funding operations and maintenance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=SARKAR|first=S|coauthors=GUPTA, A, BISWAS, R, DEB, A, GREENLEAF, J, SENGUPTA, A|title=Well-head arsenic removal units in remote villages of Indian subcontinent: Field results and performance evaluation|journal=Water Research|date=1 May 2005|volume=39|issue=10|pages=2196–2206|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.04.002}}</ref>  It has also been used to remove undesirably high concentrations of [[fluoride]].

'''[[Ion Exchange]]''' has long been used as a water-softening process, although usually on a single-home basis.  Traditional anion exchange is effective in removing As(V), but not As (III), or [[arsenic trioxide]], which doesn't have a net charge.  Effective long-term ion exchange removal of arsenic requires a trained operator to maintain the column.

Both '''[[Reverse osmosis]]''' and '''[[electrodialysis]]''' (also called ''electrodialysis reversal'') can remove arsenic with a net ionic charge.  (Note that arsenic oxide, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a common form of arsenic in groundwater that is soluble, but has no net charge.)  Some utilities presently use one of these methods to reduce [[total dissolved solids]] and therefore improve taste.  A problem with both methods is the production of high-salinity waste water, called [[brine]], or concentrate, which then must be disposed of.

'''Subterranean Arsenic Removal (SAR) Technology''' [http://www.insituarsenic.org SAR Technology]

In subterranean arsenic removal (SAR), aerated groundwater is recharged back into the aquifer to create an oxidation zone which can trap iron and arsenic on the soil particles through adsorption process. The oxidation zone created by aerated water boosts the activity of the arsenic-oxidizing microorganisms which can oxidize arsenic from +3 to +5 state [http://www.insituarsenic.org SAR Technology]. No chemicals are used and almost no sludge is produced during operational stage since iron and arsenic compounds are rendered inactive in the aquifer itself. Thus toxic waste disposal and the risk of its future mobilization is prevented. Also, it has very long operational life, similar to the long lasting tube wells drawing water from the shallow aquifers.

Six such SAR plants, funded by the World Bank and constructed by Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, Barrackpore & Queen's University Belfast, UK are operating in West Bengal. Each plant has been delivering more than 3,000 litres of arsenic and iron-free water daily to the rural community. The first community water treatment plant based on SAR technology was set up at Kashimpore near Kolkata in 2004 by a team of European and Indian engineers led by Dr. Bhaskar Sen Gupta of Queen's University Belfast for TiPOT.<ref>[http://www.worstpolluted.org/ 12 Cases of Cleanup & Success]</ref><ref>[http://www.worstpolluted.org/projects_reports/display/76 "World's Worst Polluted Places Report 2009"]</ref><ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=can-the-worlds-most-polluted-places-09-10-29&SID=mail&sc=emailfriend Scientific American]</ref><ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE59R4BE20091028?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0 Reuters Global]</ref>

SAR technology had been awarded Dhirubhai Ambani Award, 2010 from IChemE UK for Chemical Innovation. Again, SAR was the winner of the [http://www.thestandrewsprize.com/lists/2010.htm St. Andrews Award for Environment, 2010]. The SAR Project was selected by the Blacksmith Institute - New York & Green Cross- Switzerland as one of the "12 Cases of Cleanup & Success" in the World's Worst Polluted Places Report 2009. (Refer: [http://www.worstpolluted.org/files/FileUpload/files/2009-report/Blacksmith-Institute-Green-Cross-Switzerland-WWPP-Report-2009.pdf www.worstpolluted.org]).

Currently, large scale SAR plants are being installed in USA, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

===The Hungarian solution===
Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of [[chaff]]-based filters it is possible to reduce the [[arsenic]] content of  water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground [[aquifer]].<ref>[http://mno.hu/gazdasag/szenzacios-magyar-talalmany-1068315 Newspaper article] (in Hungarian) published by [[Magyar Nemzet]] on April 15, 2012.</ref>
