'''Villous adenoma''' is a type of [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]] that grows in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and other places in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and sometimes in other parts of the body. These [[adenomas]] may become [[malignant]] ([[cancerous]]).  Villous adenomas have been demonstrated to contain malignant portions in about one third of affected persons, and invasive malignancy in another one third of removed specimens. Colonic resection may be required for large lesions. These can also lead to secretory diarrhea with large volume liquid stools with few formed elements. They are commonly described as secreting large amounts of mucus, resulting in hypokalaemia in patients. On endoscopy a "cauliflower' like mass is described due villi stretching. Being an adenoma, the mass is covered in columnar epithelial tissue.
