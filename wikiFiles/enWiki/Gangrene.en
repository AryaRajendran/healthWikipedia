==Causes==
Gangrene is caused by [[infection]] or [[ischemia]], such as by the [[bacteria]] ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]''<ref>[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/genomes/bacteria/Clostridium_perfringens.html Clostridium as cause for gangrene]</ref> or by [[thrombosis]] (a blocked [[blood vessel]]). It is usually the result of critically insufficient [[blood]] supply (e.g., [[peripheral vascular disease]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=AW|last2=Afaq|first2=A |title=Management of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease|journal=Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention|volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=349–357|year=2008|month=November–December |pmid=19008688|doi=10.1097/HCR.0b013e31818c3b96}}</ref> and is often associated with [[diabetes]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Korzon-Burakowska|first1=A|last2=Dziemidok|first2=P |title=Diabetic foot-the need for comprehensive multidisciplinary approach.|journal=Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=314–317|year=2011|month=December |pmid=22216805}}</ref> and long-term tobacco smoking. This condition is most common in the lower [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]]. The best treatment for gangrene is [[revascularization]] (i.e., restoration of blood flow) of the affected organ, which can reverse some of the effects of necrosis and allow healing.  Other treatments include [[debridement]] and surgical [[amputation]].  The method of treatment is generally determined by the location of affected tissue and extent of tissue loss. Gangrene may appear as one effect of [[foot binding]].

==Types==

===Dry===
Dry gangrene begins at the distal part of the limb due to [[ischemia]], and often occurs in the toes and feet of elderly patients due to [[arteriosclerosis]] and thus, is also known as senile gangrene. Dry gangrene is mainly due to [[arterial occlusion]]. There is limited putrefaction and bacteria fail to survive. Dry gangrene spreads slowly until it reaches the point where the blood supply is adequate to keep tissue viable. The affected part is dry, shrunken and dark reddish-black, resembling [[mummy|mummified]] flesh. The dark coloration is due to liberation of [[hemoglobin]] from hemolyzed red blood cells, which is acted upon by [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) produced by the bacteria, resulting in formation of black iron sulfide that remains in the tissues.<ref>[http://compepid.tuskegee.edu/syllabi/pathobiology/pathology/genpath/chapter3.html Compepid.tuskegee.edu]</ref> The line of separation usually brings about complete separation, with eventual falling off of the gangrenous tissue if it is not removed surgically, also called [[autoamputation]].

Dry gangrene is actually a form of [[coagulative necrosis]]. If the blood flow is interrupted for a reason other than severe bacterial infection, the result is a case of dry gangrene. People with impaired peripheral blood flow, such as diabetics, are at greater risk of developing dry gangrene.

The early signs of dry gangrene are a dull ache and sensation of coldness in the affected area along with [[pallor]] of the flesh. If caught early, the process can sometimes be reversed by vascular surgery. However, if necrosis sets in, the affected tissue must be removed just as with wet gangrene.

===Wet===
Wet gangrene occurs in naturally moist tissue and organs such as the mouth, bowel, lungs, cervix, and vulva.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Bedsores]] occurring on body parts such as the sacrum, buttocks, and heels&nbsp;— although not necessarily moist areas&nbsp;— are also categorized as wet gangrene infections. It is characterized by numerous bacteria and has a poor prognosis (compared to dry gangrene) due to septicemia. In wet gangrene, the tissue is infected by saprogenic microorganisms (''Clostridium perfringens'' or ''Bacillus fusiformis'', for example), which cause tissue to swell and emit a fetid smell. Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of venous (mainly) and/or arterial blood flow. The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood, which promotes the rapid growth of bacteria. The toxic products formed by bacteria are absorbed, causing systemic manifestation of [[septicemia]] and finally death. The affected part is edematous, soft, putrid, rotten and dark. The darkness in wet gangrene occurs due to the same mechanism as in dry gangrene. Wet gangrene is coagulative necrosis progressing to [[liquefactive necrosis]].

===Gas===
{{Main|Gas gangrene}}
Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produces gas within tissues. It is a deadly form of gangrene usually caused by ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' bacteria. Infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by bacteria expand and infiltrate healthy tissue in the vicinity. Because of its ability to quickly spread to surrounding tissues, gas gangrene should be treated as a [[medical emergency]].

Gas gangrene is caused by a bacterial [[exotoxin]]-producing clostridial species, which are mostly found in soil and other anaerobes (e.g., ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and anaerobic [[Streptococcus|streptococci]]). These environmental bacteria may enter the muscle through a wound and subsequently proliferate in necrotic tissue and secrete powerful toxins. These toxins destroy nearby tissue, generating gas at the same time. A gas composition of 5.9% hydrogen, 3.4% carbon dioxide, 74.5% nitrogen, and 16.1% oxygen was reported in one clinical case.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chi CH, Chen KW, Huang JJ, Chuang YC, Wu MH |title=Gas composition in Clostridium septicum gas gangrene |journal=J. Formos. Med. Assoc. |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=757–9 |year=1995 |month=December |pmid=8541740 }}</ref>

Gas gangrene can cause [[necrosis]], gas production, and [[sepsis]]. Progression to [[bacteremia|toxemia]] and [[septic shock|shock]] is often very rapid.

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually surgical [[debridement]], wound care and antibiotic therapy although amputation is necessary in many cases. "Most amputations are performed for ischemic disease of the lower extremity. Of dysvascular amputations, 15-28% of patients undergo contralateral limb amputations within 3 years. Of elderly persons who undergo amputations, 50% survive the first 3 years."<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1232102|Amputations of the Lower Extremity}}</ref> In the United States, 30,000–40,000 amputations are performed annually. There were an estimated 1.6 million individuals living with the loss of a limb in 2005; these estimates are expected to more than double to 3.6 million such individuals by the year 2050.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ziegler-Graham K, MacKenzie EJ, Ephraim PL, Travison TG, Brookmeyer R |title=Estimating the prevalence of limb loss in the United States: 2005 to 2050 |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=422–9 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18295618 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-9993(07)01748-0}}</ref> Antibiotics alone are not effective because they may not penetrate infected tissues sufficiently.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lipsky BA |title=Evidence-based antibiotic therapy of diabetic foot infections |journal=FEMS Immunol.

Med. |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=326–7 |year=1976 |month=May |pmid=1273078 |pmc=1864235 }}</ref> Growth factors, hormones and skin grafts have also been used to accelerate healing for gangrene and other [[chronic wounds]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==
As early as 1028 [[fly]] [[maggot]]s were commonly{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} used to treat chronic wounds or [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] to prevent or arrest necrotic spread, as some species of [[maggot]]s consume only dead flesh, leaving nearby living tissue unaffected. This practice largely died out after the introduction of [[antibiotics]], [[acetonitrile]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and [[enzyme]] to the range of treatments for wounds. In recent times, however, [[maggot therapy]] has regained some credibility and is sometimes employed with great [[efficacy]] in cases of chronic tissue necrosis.

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of gangrene derives from the [[Latin]] word ''gangraena'' and from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''gangraina'' (γάγγραινα), which means "[[putrefaction]] of tissues". It has no etymological connection with the word [[green]], despite the affected areas turning black and/or green and/or yellowish brown.  It is coincidence that, in [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] the words "gang green" (go green) can be said to be an [[eggcorn]] for gangrene, as it describes the symptoms of the affliction.
