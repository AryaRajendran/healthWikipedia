'''Small-cell carcinoma''' (sometimes known as "small-cell lung cancer", or "oat-cell carcinoma") is a type of highly [[malignant]] [[cancer]] that most commonly arises within the [[lung]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000951105|small-cell carcinoma}}</ref> although it can occasionally arise in other body sites, such as the [[cervix]],<ref name='NasuHirakawa'>{{cite journal |author=Nasu K, Hirakawa T, Okamoto M, ''et al.'' |title=Advanced small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy with irinotecan and cisplatin followed by radical surgery |journal=Rare Tumors |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e6 |year=2011 |pmid=21464879 |pmc=3070456 |doi=10.4081/rt.2011.e6 }}</ref> [[prostate]],<ref name='CapizzelloPeponi'>{{cite journal |author=Capizzello A, Peponi E, Simou N, ''et al.'' |title=Pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate: a case report and literature review |journal=Case Rep Oncol |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=88–95 |year=2011 |pmid=21475596 |pmc=3072185 |doi=10.1159/000324717 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=10.1159/000324717}}</ref> and gastrointesinal tract.

==Cytopathology==
Small-cell carcinoma is an undifferentiated [[neoplasm]] composed of primitive-appearing cells.

As the name implies, the cells in small-cell carcinomas are smaller than normal cells, and barely have room for any cytoplasm. Some researchers identify this as a failure in the mechanism that controls the size of the cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leslie M |title=Mysteries of the cell. How does a cell know its size? |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6059 |pages=1047–8 |year=2011 |month=November |pmid=22116854 |doi=10.1126/science.334.6059.1047 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=22116854}}</ref>

==Paraneoplastic syndromes==
In a significant number of cases, small-cell carcinomas can produce [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] [[hormones]], including [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and [[anti-diuretic hormone]] (ADH). Ectopic production of large amounts of ADH leads to [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion]] (SIADH).

[[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (LEMS) is a well-known paraneoplastic condition linked to small-cell carcinoma.<ref name='TitulaerVerschuuren'>{{cite journal |author=Titulaer MJ, Verschuuren JJ |title=Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: tumor versus nontumor forms |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1132 |issue= |pages=129–34 |year=2008 |pmid=18567862 |doi=10.1196/annals.1405.030 }}</ref>

===Lung===
[[Image:Lung small cell carcinoma (1) by core needle biopsy.jpg|thumb|right|Histopathologic image of small-cell carcinoma of the lung. CT-guided core needle biopsy. [[H&E stain]].]]
When associated with the lung, it is sometimes called "oat cell carcinoma" due to the flat cell shape and scanty [[cytoplasm]].

It is thought to originate from [[neuroendocrine cell]]s ([[APUD cell]]s) in the [[bronchus]] called Feyrter cells (named for [[Friedrich Feyrter]]).<ref name="pmid17028417">{{cite journal |author=Champaneria MC, Modlin IM, Kidd M, Eick GN |title=Friedrich Feyrter: a precise intellect in a diffuse system |journal=Neuroendocrinology |volume=83 |issue=5-6 |pages=394–404 |year=2006 |pmid=17028417 |doi=10.1159/000096050 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=000096050}}</ref> 
Hence, they express a variety of neuroendocrine markers, and may lead to [[Ectopic hormone|ectopic]] production of hormones like [[Antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] and [[ACTH]] that may result in [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s and Cushing's syndrome.<ref name=Kumar-ssc/> Approximately half of all individuals diagnosed with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) will eventually be found to have a small-cell carcinoma of the lung.<ref name="TitulaerVerschuuren"/>

Small-cell carcinoma is most often more rapidly and widely [[Metastasis|metastatic]] than [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]]<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=759}}</ref> (and hence staged differently).

===Combined small-cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC)===
{{main|Combined small-cell lung carcinoma}}

When it is found with one or more differentiated forms of [[lung cancer]], such as [[squamous cell carcinoma]] or [[adenocarcinoma]], the malignant tumor is then diagnosed and classified as a [[combined small cell lung carcinoma]] (c-SCLC).<ref name="who2004"/> C-SCLC is the only currently recognized subtype of SCLC.<ref name="who2004"/>

Although combined small-cell lung carcinoma is currently staged and treated similarly to "pure" small-cell carcinoma of the lung, recent research suggests surgery might improve outcomes in very early stages of this tumor type.

Smoking is a significant [[Etiology|etiological]] factor. 

Symptoms and signs are as for other [[lung cancer]]s.  In addition, because of their neuroendocrine cell origin, small-cell carcinomas will often secrete substances that result in [[paraneoplastic syndromes]] such as [[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]].

===Extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma===
Very rarely, the primary site for small-cell carcinoma is outside of the lungs and pleural space, it is referred to as extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma (EPSCC). Outside of the respiratory tract, small cell carcinoma can appear in the cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, or bladder.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ismaili N | title=A rare bladder cancer – small cell carcinoma: review and update | journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |volume=6 |issue=75 | year=2011 | month=November | pmid=22078012 | doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-75 | pmc=3253713}}</ref> It is estimated to account for 1,000 new cases a year in the U.S. Histologically similar to small-cell lung cancer, therapies for small-cell lung cancer are usually used to treat EPSCC.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|284288|Extrapulmonary Small Cell Carcinoma}}</ref>  First line treatment is usually with cisplatin and etoposide. In Japan, the first line treatment is shifting to irinotecan and cisplatin.

When the primary site is in the skin, it is referred to as [[Merkel cell carcinoma]].

===Small-cell carcinoma of the prostate===
In the prostate, small-cell carcinoma (SCCP) is a rare form of [[prostate cancer|cancer]] (approx 1% of PC).<ref name="pmid9227387">{{cite journal |author=Nutting C, Horwich A, Fisher C, Parsons C, Dearnaley DP |title=Small-cell carcinoma of the prostate |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=340–1 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9227387 |pmc=1296316 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Due to the fact that there is little variation in [[prostate specific antigen]] levels, this form of cancer is normally diagnosed at an advanced stage, after metastasis.

It can metastasize to the brain.<ref name="pmid12463494">{{cite journal |author=Erasmus CE, Verhagen WI, Wauters CA, van Lindert EJ |title=Brain metastasis from prostate small-cell carcinoma: not to be neglected |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=375–7 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12463494 |doi= |url=http://cjns.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0317-1671&volume=29&issue=4&spage=375}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Small-cell lung carcinoma has long been divided into two clinicopathological stages, including limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES). The stage is generally determined by the presence or absence of metastases, whether or not the tumor appears limited to the thorax, and whether or not the entire tumor burden within the chest can feasibly be encompassed within a single radiotherapy portal.<ref name='ArgirisMurren'>{{cite journal |author=Argiris A, Murren JR |title=Staging and clinical prognostic factors for small-cell lung cancer |journal=Cancer J |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=437–47 |year=2001 |pmid=11693903 }}</ref> In general, if the tumor is confined to one lung and the lymph nodes close to that lung, the cancer is said to be LS. If the cancer has spread beyond that, it is said to be ES.  

In cases of LS-SCLC, combination chemotherapy (often including [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cisplatinum]], [[doxorubicin]], [[etoposide]], [[vincristine]] and/or [[paclitaxel]]) is administered together with concurrent chest radiotherapy (RT). 

Chest RT has been shown to improve survival in LS-SCLC.

Exceptionally high objective initial response rates (RR) of between 60% and 90% are seen in LS-SCLC using [[chemotherapy]] alone, with between 45% and 75% of individuals showing a "complete response" (CR), which is defined as the disappearance of all radiological and clinical signs of tumor. Unfortunately, relapse is the rule, and median survival is only 18 to 24 months.

Because SCLC usually metastasizes widely very early on in the natural history of the tumor, and because nearly all cases respond dramatically to CT and/or RT, there has been little role for surgery in this disease since the 1970s.<ref name='Mountain1978'>{{cite journal |author=Mountain CF |title=Clinical biology of small cell carcinoma: relationship to surgical therapy |journal=Semin. Oncol. |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=272–9 |year=1978 |month=September |pmid=211638 }}</ref> However, recent work suggests that in cases of small, asymptomatic, node-negative SCLC's ("very limited stage"), surgical excision may improve survival when used prior to chemotherapy.("adjuvant chemotherapy").<ref name='Shepard2011'>{{cite journal |author=Shepherd FA |title=Surgery for limited stage small cell lung cancer: time to fish or cut bait |journal=J Thorac Oncol |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=147–9 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20101141 |doi=10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181c8cbf5 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1556-0864&volume=5&issue=2&spage=147}}</ref>

In ES-SCLC, combination chemotherapy is the standard of care, with radiotherapy added only to palliate symptoms such as [[dyspnea]], pain from liver or bone metastases, or for treatment of [[brain metastases]], which, in small-cell [[lung carcinoma]], typically have a rapid, if temporary, response to whole brain radiotherapy. 

Combination chemotherapy consists of a wide variety of agents, including [[cisplatin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]] and [[carboplatin]]. Response rates are high even in extensive disease, with between 15% and 30% of subjects having a complete response to combination [[chemotherapy]], and the vast majority having at least some objective response. Responses in ES-SCLC are often of short duration, however.

If complete response to [[chemotherapy]] occurs in a subject with SCLC, then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is often used in an attempt to prevent the emergence of [[brain metastases]]. Although this treatment is often effective, it can cause hair loss and fatigue. Prospective randomized trials with almost two years follow-up have not shown neurocognitive ill-effects. Meta-analyses of randomized trials confirm that PCI provides significant survival benefits.

All in all, small-cell carcinoma is very responsive to [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]], and in particular, regimens based on platinum-containing agents. However, most people with the disease relapse, and median survival remains low.

==Prognosis==
In ''limited-stage'' disease, median survival with treatment is 14–20 months, and about 20% of patients with limited-stage small-cell lung carcinoma live 5 years or longer. 

The prognosis is far worse in ''extensive-stage'' small-cell lung carcinoma, with treatment, median survival is just 8–13 months, and only 1–5% of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung carcinoma treated with chemotherapy live 5 years or longer.
