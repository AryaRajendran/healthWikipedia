</ref> The population of that era had no way of identifying specific diseases in their livestock so they simply put all illnesses under one heading.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Murrain does not refer to any specific disease but was an umbrella term for a number of different diseases, including [[rinderpest]], [[Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae|erysipelas]], [[foot-and-mouth disease]], [[anthrax]], and [[streptococcus]] infections. Some of the diseases could also affect humans. The term murrain was also used generally to refer to an [[epidemic]] of such a disease. There were major sheep and cattle murrains in Europe during the 14th century, which combined with the [[Little Ice Age]] resulted in widespread famine during the [[Great Famine of 1315-1317]], weakening the population of Europe before the onset of the [[Black Death]] in 1348.<ref>{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = William C | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Great Famine: Northern Europe in the Early Fourteenth Century | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1996 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-691-05891-1 }}</ref>

The term murrain is also used in some [[Bible]] translations relating to the [[Plagues of Egypt|fifth plague]] brought upon Egypt.

[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 9:3: "Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain."

"Pestilence", which is mentioned 47 times in 46 verses of the Bible, can be translated "murrain" by Christian apologists.
[Enhanced Strong’s Lexicon].
see [[Psalms]] 91:3 KJV

The word in Hebrew is דֶּבֶר "dever" (Strong's # 01698), derived from the primitive root "dabar" in the sense of "to destroy."

In some parts of [[Scotland]], [[force-fire]] was believed to cure it and in some remote regions of [[Cumbria]], [[England]], murrain is still used as a term for a [[curse]], specifically a [[curse]] placed upon land or livestock. It is believed that the [[medieval]] term has, by a process of [[syncreticism]] become synonymous with [[witchcraft]].<ref>
