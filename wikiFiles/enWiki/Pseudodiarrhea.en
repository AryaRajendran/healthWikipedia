'''Pseudodiarrhea''', formerly known as '''hyperdefecation''', is defined as increased stool frequency (more than three times daily) with a normal daily stool weight of less than 300 g.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fine KD, Schiller LR | title=AGA technical review on the evaluation and management of chronic diarrhea | journal=Gastroenterology | year=1999 | pages=1464–86 | volume=116 | issue=6 | doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(99)70513-5 | pmid = 10348832 }}</ref>

Pseudodiarrhea is often associated with rectal urgency and accompanies [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[hyperthyroidism]], and anorectal disorders such as [[proctitis]].  Patients with rectal obstruction (e.g., from fecal impaction, obstruction due to a vaginal [[pessary]]) may also present with pseudodiarrhea, since only liquid stool can make it through.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chou YC, Yu KJ | title=Entrapped vaginal pessary presented with frequency and urge incontinence | journal=J Chin Med Assoc | year=2003 | pages=181–3 | volume=66 | issue=3 | pmid = 12779040 }}</ref><ref> {{cite journal | author=Tatar EL, Trivedi C | title=Pseudodiarrhea caused by vaginal pessary in an elderly patient | journal=J Am Geriatr Soc | year=2005 | pages=1083 | volume=53 | issue=6 | doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53338_10.x | pmid = 15935050 }}</ref>


Pseudodiarrhea may be more common than chronic diarrhea and should always be considered in patients complaining of chronic diarrhea.
