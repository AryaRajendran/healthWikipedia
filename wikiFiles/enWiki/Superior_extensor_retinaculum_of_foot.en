The '''superior extensor retinaculum of the foot''' ('''transverse crural ligament''') of the ankle is the upper part of the [[anterior annular ligament]]. 

The transverse crural ligament binds down the tendons of [[Extensor digitorum longus]], [[Extensor hallucis longus]], [[Peron√¶us tertius]], and [[Tibialis anterior]] as they descend on the front of the tibia and fibula; under it are found also the [[anterior tibial vessels]] and [[deep peroneal nerve]]. 

It is found on the lateral side of the lower leg, attached laterally to the lower end of the [[fibula]], and medially to the [[tibia]]; above it is continuous with the [[fascia]] of the leg.
