'''MOMO syndrome''' is an extremely rare [[genetic disorder]] which belongs to the overgrowth syndromes and has been diagnosed in only six cases around the world, and occurs in 1 in 100 million births. The name is an [[acronym]] of the four primary aspects of the disorder: [[Macrosomia|'''M'''acrosomia]] (excessive birth weight), [[Obesity|'''O'''besity]], [[Macrocephaly|'''M'''acrocephaly]] (excessive head size) and [[human eye|'''O'''cular]] abnormalities.  It is unknown if it is a life-limiting condition. MOMO syndrome was first diagnosed in 1993<ref>{{cite journal | author=Moretti-Ferreira D, Koiffmann CP, Listik M, Setian N, Wajntal A | title=Macrosomia, obesity, macrocephaly and ocular abnormalities (MOMO syndrome) in two unrelated patients: delineation of a newly recognized overgrowth syndrome | journal=Am J Med Genet | year=1993 | pages=555–8 | volume=46 | issue=5  | pmid=8322820 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320460519}}</ref> by Professor Célia Priszkulnik Koiffmann, a [[Brazil]]ian researcher in the Genetic and Clinical Studies of neurodevelopmental disorders.

This syndrome's [[acronym]] is an intended [[pun]]. It refers to the traditionally tall and obese king of Carnivals, [[Momus#Mardi Gras|Momus]]—[[King Momo|Rei Momo]] in Portuguese.

==Signs and symptoms==
Along with the four aspects of the disorder that give it its name, there are also other common symptoms:
*A downward slant of the forehead
*Delayed bone maturation
*Mental retardation

The ocular abnormalities are generally [[retina]]l [[coloboma]] and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|MOMO syndrome is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.]]
Because MOMO is such a rare disorder, very few studies have been conducted into its causes.  Current research suggests that it is linked to a de novo (new) [[autosome|autosomal dominant]] mutation.<ref name="pmid8322820">{{cite journal |author=Moretti-Ferreira D, Koiffmann CP, Listik M, Setian N, Wajntal A |title=Macrosomia, obesity, macrocephaly and ocular abnormalities (MOMO syndrome) in two unrelated patients: delineation of a newly recognized overgrowth syndrome |journal=Am.

==Confirmed cases==
Archie Thompson was born in 2002 in [[Icklesham]], [[England]] and weighed 8&nbsp;lb 4 oz (3740 g).  By 15 months his weight had increased to 4 [[Stone (weight)|stone]] (56&nbsp;lb; 25&nbsp;kg) and by 24 months it was up to 6 stone (84 pounds; 38&nbsp;kg).  The condition placed a large strain on his heart and lungs.  The Thompson family were featured in a [[Documentary film|documentary]] for [[Five (TV)|Five]] first shown on 3 October 2004. It has since aired on [[Discovery Fit & Health]] in the United States.

Danielle Falan, from [[São Paulo]], Brazil, is one of the oldest surviving sufferers of MOMO syndrome.  At age 17 she was featured in the Archie Thompson documentary as her mother traveled to visit her in Brazil.  Falan attended [[school]] as normal, and hopes to attend college.
