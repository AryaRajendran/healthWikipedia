'''Gitelman syndrome''' is an autosomal recessive kidney disorder characterized by hypokalemic [[metabolic alkalosis]] with hypocalciuria, and hypomagnesemia. It is caused by loss of function mutations of the [[thiazide]]sensitive [[sodium-chloride symporter]] (also known as NCC, NCCT, or TSC) located in the [[distal convoluted tubule]].<ref name="pmid8528245">{{cite journal | author = Simon DB, Nelson-Williams C, Bia MJ, Ellison D, Karet FE, Molina AM, Vaara I, Iwata F, Cushner HM, Koolen M, Gainza FJ, Gitleman HJ, Lifton RP. | title = Gitelman's variant of Bartter's syndrome, inherited hypokalaemic alkalosis, is caused by mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter. | journal = Nat.

Gitelman syndrome was formerly considered a subset of [[Bartter syndrome]] until the distinct genetic and molecular bases of these disorders were identified.  Bartter syndrome is also an autosomal recessive hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, but it derives from a mutation to the [[Na-K-Cl cotransporter|NKCC2]] found in the [[thick ascending limb]] of the [[loop of Henle]].<ref name="pmid8640224">{{cite journal | author = Simon DB, Karet FE, Hamdan JM, DiPietro A, Sanjad SA, Lifton RP | title = Bartter's syndrome, hypokalaemic alkalosis with hypercalciuria, is caused by mutations in the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC2 | journal = Nat.

==Cause==
[[Image:Gitelman syndrome.jpg|thumb|left|A model of transport mechanisms in the [[distal convoluted tubule]]. Sodium-chloride (NaCl) enters the cell via the apical thiazide-sensitive NCC and leaves the cell through the basolateral Cl- channel (ClC-Kb), and the Na+/K+-ATPase. Indicated also are the recently identified magnesium channel TRPM6 in the apical membrane, and a putative Na/Mg exchanger in the basolateral membrane. These transport mechanisms play a role in familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia or Gitelman's syndrome.]]
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Gitelman syndrome has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]]

Gitelman's syndrome is linked to inactivating mutations in the ''[[SLC12A3]]'' gene resulting in a loss of function of the encoded [[thiazide]]-sensitive [[sodium-chloride symporter|sodium-chloride co-transporter]] (NCCT). This cell membrane protein participates in the control of ion [[homeostasis]] at the [[distal convoluted tubule]] portion of the [[nephron]].  

Gitelman's syndrome is an [[autosome|autosomal]]-recessive disorder: one defective [[allele]] has to be inherited from each parent.

==Presentation==
People suffering from Gitelman's syndrome present symptoms which are identical to those of patients who are on [[thiazide]] [[diuretics]]<ref name="pmid15085183">{{cite journal |author=O'Shaughnessy KM, Karet FE |title=Salt handling and hypertension |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=113 |issue=8 |pages=1075–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15085183 |doi=10.1172/JCI200421560 |pmc=385413}}</ref>

Clinical symptoms for this disease are hypochloremic [[metabolic alkalosis]], [[hypokalemia]], and [[hypocalciuria]]. [[Hypomagnesemia]] is present in many but not all cases. In contrast to patients with [[Gordon's syndrome]], those suffering from Gitelman's syndrome are generally normotensive. Carriers of Gitelman's syndrome-linked mutations are often asymptomatic while some complain of mild muscular [[cramp]]s or weakness expressed as fatigue or irritability. More severe symptoms such as [[tetany (medical sign)|tetany]] and [[paralysis]] have however also been reported. Phenotypic variations observed among patients probably result from differences in their genetic background and may depend on which particular amino acid in the NCCT protein has been mutated.
