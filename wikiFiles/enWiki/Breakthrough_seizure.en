A '''breakthrough seizure''' is an [[epileptic seizure]] that occurs despite the use of [[anticonvulsant]]s that have otherwise successfully prevented seizures in the patient.<ref name=emergency>{{cite book|last=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|title=Emergency care and transportation of the sick and injured|year=2006|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Massachusetts|isbn=9780763744052|pages=456,498|edition=9th|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QEqypOz5SzIC&pg=PA456}}</ref>{{rp|456}} Breakthrough seizures may be more dangerous than non-breakthrough seizures because are unexpected by the patient, who may have considered himself or herself free from seizures and therefore, not take any precautions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.touchneurology.com/articles/breakthrough-seizures-approach-prevention-and-diagnosis|title=Breakthrough Seizures—Approach to Prevention and Diagnosis|first=Alan B.|last= Ettinger|first2=Radhika K.|last2= Adiga|journal=US Neurology|year=2008|volume=4|issue=1|pages=40–42}}</ref>

Breakthrough seizures are more likely given the intensity and number of [[seizure trigger|triggers]].<ref name=familyguide>{{cite book|last=Devinsky|first=Orrin|title=Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide|year=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=New York|isbn=9781932603415|edition=3rd|pages=57–68|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4SOA3rg5DK0C&pg=PA57}}</ref>{{rp|57}}

Often when a breakthrough seizure occurs in a person whose seizures have always been well controlled, there is a new underlying cause to the seizure.<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=D.

==Causes==
Causes of a breakthrough seizure include:

;[[Missed dose]] of an anticonvulsant: This is the most common cause, and it may even result in [[status epilepticus]]. In some patients, even a single missed dose may be responsible for a breakthrough seizure.<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|57}}
;Incorrectly timed dose: This may occur, for example, if a patient takes a dose a later than the prescribed time. Also, a patient traveling across time zone lines may alter their medicating schedule, resulting in interference with the therapeutic effects of the drug<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|60}}
;Incorrect dosage amount: A patient may be receiving a sub-therapeutic level of the anticonvulsant.<ref>{{cite book|first= Ellen F.|last=Crain|first2= Jeffrey C. |last=Gershel|title=Clinical manual of emergency pediatrics|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Publishing Division|location=New York|isbn=9780071377508|edition=4th|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iqVZdtU0L-QC&pg=PA475}}</ref>
;Switching medicines: This may include sudden withdrawal of an anticonvulsant without replacing it at all, or to switch abruptly to another anticonvulsant. In some cases, switching from brand to the [[generic drug|generic]] version of the same medicine may induce a breakthrough seizure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Anuradha|title=100 Questions & Answers About Your Child's Epilepsy|year=2009|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Massachusetts|isbn=9780763755218|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kR4eKEQ4C2EC&pg=PA120|series=100 Questions & Answers}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3120036 | volume=37 | issue=12 | title=Breakthrough seizure following substitution of Depakene capsules (Abbott) with a generic product | year=1987 | month=December | last=MacDonald |first=J. T. | journal=Neurology | page=1885}}</ref>
;[[Sleep deprivation]]: Failure to get enough restorative sleep in some patients may result in a seizure.<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|61}} This will often be the patient's only change in routine prior to a seizure.<ref name=fink00>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Fink|first=George|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Stress|year=2000|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=9780122267352|edition=1st|title=Stress and Seizures|page=68|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6lvXGInU2REC&pg=PA68}}</ref>
;Stress<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|66}}
;Alcohol or drug use<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|63}}: This includes [[caffeine]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Devinsky|first=Orrin|title=Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Epilepsy|year=2005|publisher=Demos Medical Pub.|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=9781888799897|last2=Schachter|first2=Steven|first3=Steven|last3=Pacia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vp1VA963Rc0C&pg=PA25}}</ref>  and [[over-the-counter drug]]s in some.<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|67}}
;[[Menstruation]]<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|65}}: This may be the result of hormonal fluctuation or over-the-counter drugs that are used to treat symptoms of menstruation.<ref name=fink00 />
;[[Acute illness]]: Some illnesses caused by [[virus]]es or [[bacterial infection|bacteria]] may lead to a seizure, especially when [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]] occur, as this may reduce the [[drug absorption|absorption]] of the anticonvulsant.<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|67}}
;[[Malnutrition]]: May be the result of poor dietary habits, lack of access to proper nourishment, or [[fasting]].<ref name=familyguide />{{rp|68}} In seizures that are controlled by diet in children, a child may break from the diet on their own.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=John M.|title=Ketogenic Diets: Treatments for Epilepsy|year=2006|publisher=Demos|location=New York|isbn=9781932603187|edition=4th|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w8SLjhqr6VEC&pg=PA54|page=54|series=Demos Health Series|first2=Eric|last2=Kossoff|first3=Millicent|last3=Kelly}}</ref>
;[[Drug interaction]]s: caused by antihistamines and antidepressants lower the effectiveness of anticonvulsants.

==Rates==
Rates of breakthrough seizures vary. Studies have shown the rates of breakthrough seizures ranging from 11–37%.<ref>{{cite book|first=John M. |last=Pellock|first2=Blaise F.D.|last=Bourgeois|first3=W. Edwin|last3=Dodson|first4=Douglas R.|last4= Nordli, Jr.|first5=Raman|last5=Sankar|title=Pediatric Epilepsy: Diagnosis and Therapy|year=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=New York|isbn=9781933864167|edition=3rd|series=Springer Demos Medicical Series|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vnjSrRuzob4C&pg=PA287|page=287}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The treatment for a breakthrough seizure involves measuring the level of the anticonvulsant in the patient's system, and may include increasing the dosage of the existing medication, adding another medication in addition to the existing one, or altogether switching medications.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jerome|last= Engel, Jr.|first2=Timothy A.|last2=Pedley|first3=Jean|last3= Aicardi|title=Epilepsy: A Comprehensive Textbook|year=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781757775|edition=2nd|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TwlXrOBkAS8C&pg=RA1-PA791}}</ref>

One who suffers a breakthrough seizure when he or she is not known to have them may require hospitalization for a period of time for observation.<ref name=emergency />{{rp|498}}
