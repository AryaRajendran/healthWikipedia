'''Hyperestrogenism''', or '''estrogen excess''', is a [[medical condition]] characterized by an excessive amount of [[estrogen]]ic activity in the body.<ref name="Lavin2009">{{cite book | author = Norman Lavin | title = Manual of Endocrinology and Metabolism | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=a-Eg0vPb6o4C&pg=PA274 | accessdate = 5 June 2012 | date = 1 April 2009 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | isbn = 978-0-7817-6886-3 | page = 274}}</ref>

==Causes==
Hyperestrogenism can be caused by [[ovarian tumor]]s,<ref name="Lloyd2010">{{cite book | author = Ricardo V.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of hyperestrogenism may include heightened levels of one or more of the estrogen [[sex hormone]]s (usually [[estradiol]] and/or [[estrone]]), lowered levels of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and/or [[luteinizing hormone]] (due to suppression of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]] by estrogen), and lowered levels of [[androgen]]s such as [[testosterone]] (generally only relevant to males).<ref name="Lavin2009" /> Symptoms of the condition in women may consist of [[irregular menstruation|menstrual irregularities]], [[amenorrhea]], abnormal [[vaginal bleeding]], and enlargement of the [[uterus]] and [[breast]]s.<ref name="Lloyd2010" /><ref name="Lavin2009" /> It may also present as [[isosexual precocity]] in children<ref name="Lloyd2010" /><ref name="Lavin2009" /> and as [[hypogonadism]], [[gynecomastia]], [[feminization (biology)|feminization]], [[impotence]], and loss of [[libido]] in males.<ref name="GoldfrankFlomenbaum2006" /> If left untreated, hyperestrogenism may increase the risk of estrogen-sensitive cancers such as [[breast cancer]] later in life.

==Treatments==
Treatment may consist of [[surgery]] in the case of tumors,<ref name="Lavin2009" /> lower doses of estrogen in the case of exogenously-mediated estrogen excess, and estrogen-suppressing medications like [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue]]s and [[progestogen]]s. In addition, androgens may be supplemented in the case of males.
