'''Idiopathic hypersomnia''' is a disease, thought to be a [[neurological disorder]], which is characterized primarily by severe [[excessive daytime sleepiness]] (EDS).<ref name="ref-3">{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = International classification of sleep disorders, revised: Diagnostic and coding manual | url = http://www.esst.org/adds/ICSD.pdf | publisher = American Academy of Sleep Medicine | year = 2001 | accessdate = 25 January 2013 }}</ref> It has historically been rarely diagnosed and is often very difficult to diagnose at an early stage; it is usually a lifelong chronic disease, which is often debilitating.<ref name="ref-3" /> There is a very low level of public awareness of idiopathic hypersomnia, which often leads to stigma for those who suffer from it.<ref name=" Medscape Overview#aw2aab6b2b5" /> Currently, there is no cure, there are no FDA-approved treatments, and research dollars for its study are scarce.<ref name="foundation-treatment" /> <ref name="ref-5" />

In the medical literature, idiopathic hypersomnia may also be referred to as IH, IHS, primary hypersomnia, central hypersomnia, or hypersomnia of brain origin.  The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defines idiopathic hypersomnia as [[excessive daytime sleepiness|EDS]] without narcolepsy or the associated features of other sleep disorders.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 =  | first1 =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-IV- | year = 2000 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 0-89042-025-4 }}</ref>  It occurs in the absence of medical problems that can cause secondary [[hypersomnia]], and it occurs "despite normal quality and quantity of night time sleep (and sometimes despite exceptionally long periods of night time sleep).  Primary Hypersomnia is thought to arise from problems with the brain’s systems that regulate sleep and wake."<ref name="foundation-about">{{cite web |url=http://hypersomniafoundation.org/about-hypersomnia |title=About Hypersomnia  |publisher=Hypersomnia Foundation |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>

== Classification ==

In addition to differentiating between the primary and secondary hypersomnias, the 2001 [[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]] (ICSD) further classified the primary hypersomnia syndromes.  These included idiopathic hypersomnia, [[narcolepsy]], and the recurrent hypersomnias (like [[Klein-Levin syndrome]]).<ref name="foundation-about" />

The 2001 ICSD defines idiopathic hypersomnia as "a disorder of presumed [[central nervous system]] cause that is associated with a normal or prolonged major sleep episode and excessive sleepiness consisting of prolonged (1 to 2 hour) sleep episodes of N-REM"([[non-rapid eye movement sleep]]).<ref name="ref-3" /> The ICSD initially described two clinical forms of idiopathic hypersomnia: "1) a polysymptomatic form with nocturnal sleep and naps of abnormally long duration with ‘sleep drunkenness’ on awakening, and 2) a monosymptomatic form manifested by isolated EDS."  These forms were later described as idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time and idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time, respectively.<ref name="ref-1">{{cite journal |title=Differential Diagnosis in Hypersomnia |author=Dauvilliers, Yves et al |journal=Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |date=2006-04-01 |doi=10.1007/s11910-996-0039-2 |publisher=Current Medicine Group |accessdate= }}</ref>

This classification has been steadily evolving, as further research has now shown overlap between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. <ref name="1997 Bassetti"> {{cite journal | title = Idiopathic hypersomnia A series of 42 patients | journal = Brain | date = 1997 | last = Bassetti | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref> The 3rd edition of the ICSD is currently being finalized, and its new classification will label narcolepsy caused by [[hypocretin]] deficiency as “type 1 narcolepsy,” which is almost always associated with [[cataplexy]].  The other hypersomnias will remain subdivided based on the presence of sleep-onset [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] periods (SOREMPs). They will be labeled: “type 2 narcolepsy,” with 2 or more SOREMPs on mean sleep latency testing ([[MSLT]]); and “idiopathic hypersomnia,” with less than 2 SOREMPS.<ref name="2012 Mignot"> {{cite journal | title = A Practical Guide to the Therapy of Narcolepsy and Hypersomnia Syndromes | journal = Neurotherapeutics | date = 2012 | first = Emmanuel J. M. | last = Mignot | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref>

However, “there is no evidence that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/> Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy, the [[DSM-5|5th edition]] of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies both idiopathic hypersomnia with and without long sleep time as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low hypocretin, including not only idiopathic hypersomnia, but also narcolepsy without cataplexy, and long sleepers (patients requiring >10 hours sleep/day).<ref name="2012 Mignot"/> <ref name="Emory IH Diagnosis"> {{cite web | url = http://sleep.emory.edu/sleep_disorders/idiopathic_hypersomnia/diagnosis.html | title = Diagnosis of Idiopathic Hypersomnia/ Major Hypersomnolence Disorder | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref> <ref name="ref-orig-4">{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/RecentUpdates.aspx |title=Recent Updates to Proposed Revisions for DSM-5: Sleep-Wake Disorders |author= |work=DSM-5 Development |publisher= American Psychiatric Association |accessdate= }}</ref>

Further complicating these updated classification schemes, overlap between narcolepsy with cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia has also been reported.  A subgroup of narcoleptics with long sleep time, comprising 18% of narcoleptics in one study, had symptoms of both narcolepsy with cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia (long sleep time and unrefreshing naps). It is felt that this subgroup might have dysfunction in multiple arousal systems.<ref name="2009 Vernet"> {{cite journal | title = Narcolepsy with Long Sleep Time | journal = Sleep | date = 2009 | first = Cyrille | last = Vernet | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref> (See [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Causes|Causes]] section below).

== Symptoms ==

Those who suffer from idiopathic hypersomnia have recurring episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). These occur in spite of “adequate, or more typically, extraordinary sleep amounts (e.g., greater than 10 hours per night).”<ref name="foundation-about" /> Sleep is usually quite deep, with significant difficulty arousing from sleep, even with use of several alarm clocks.  In fact, patients with IH often must develop elaborate rituals to wake, as alarm clocks and even physical attempts by friends/family to wake them may fail. Despite getting more hours of sleep than typically required by the human body, patients awake unrefreshed and may also suffer [[sleep inertia]], known more descriptively in its severe form as sleep drunkenness (significant disorientation upon awakening).<ref name="Roth-1972">{{cite journal |title=Hypersomnia With "Sleep Drunkenness" |author=Bendrich Roth, MD; Sonia Nevsimalova, MD; Allan Rechtschaffen, PhD |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=456–462 |date=May 1972 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1972.01750230066013 |accessdate= }}</ref> Daytime naps are generally very long (up to several hours) and are also unrefreshing, as opposed to the short refreshing naps associated with narcolepsy.<ref name="foundation-about" /> [[Sleep paralysis]] and [[hypnagogic hallucinations]] may also be seen, and these symptoms are actually as common in idiopathic hypersomnia as they are in narcolepsy without cataplexy. <ref name="1997 Bassetti"/>

Other symptoms include palpitations, digestive problems, difficulty with body temperature regulation, and cognitive problems, especially deficits in memory, attention, and concentration.  Anxiety and depression are often increased in idiopathic hypersomnia, most likely as a result of the severe fatigue.<ref name="ref-orig-7">{{cite journal |title=Subjective symptoms in idiopathic hypersomnia: beyond excessive sleepiness |author=Vernet, C., Leu-Semenescu, S., Buzare, M.-A. and Arnulf, I. |year=2010 |journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=525–534 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2010.00824.x |quote= }}</ref>  Peripheral vascular symptoms, such as cold hands and feet ([[Raynauds|Raynaud’s-type phenomena]]) are quite common.  In addition to difficulty with temperature regulation and Raynaud’s type symptoms, other symptoms associated with [[autonomic dysfunction]] are not uncommon in idiopathic hypersomnia.  These may include: fainting episodes ([[syncope]]); dizziness upon arising ([[orthostatic hypotension]]); and headaches (possibly [[migraine|migrainous]] in quality).<ref name="ref-orig-7"/> Food cravings and [[impotence]] can also be associated. <ref name="2001 Billiard"> {{cite journal | title = Idiopathic Hypersomnia| journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | date = 2001 | first = M. | last = Billiard | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref> In addition, some patients “exhibit hypersensitivity to sedating medications such as [[anesthetics]], sleeping pills, or alcohol."<ref name="foundation-about" />

Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia display these symptoms continually for months or years.<ref name="ref-orig-8" /> Symptom intensity often varies between weeks, months, or years, and symptoms sometimes worsen just prior to [[menses]] in women.<ref name="foundation-about" /> Many patients are chronically tardy to work, school or social engagements<ref name="ref-orig-13" /> and, over time, may lose the ability to function in family, social, occupational or other settings altogether.<ref name="ref-orig-8">{{cite web |url= http://www.beatcfsandfms.org/references/IdiopathicHypersomnia.html |title=Idiopathic Hypersomnia |accessdate= |author= Michel Billiard, MD |work=Sleep Disorders I |year= |month= |pages=573–582 |publisher=Gui-de-Chauliac Hospital, Neurology B Department, 34295 Montpellier, Cedex 05, France  |doi=  |quote= }}</ref>  (See [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Prognosis|Prognosis]] section below).

== Causes ==

Unlike narcolepsy with cataplexy, which has a known cause ([[autoimmune]] destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons), the cause of [[idiopathic]] hypersomnia has, until recently, been largely unknown, hence its name. However, researchers have identified a few abnormalities associated with IH, which with further study may help to clarify the etiology. <ref name="2012 Mignot" />

Destruction of nonadrenergic neurons has produced hypersomnia in experimental animal studies, and injury to [[adrenergic]] neurons has also been shown to lead to hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia has also been associated with a malfunction of the [[norepinephrine]] system and decreased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) [[histamine]]  levels.<ref name="emed overview 1">{{Cite web  | last = Preda | first = Adrian | title = Primary Hypersomnia: Etiology | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/291699-overview#aw2aab6b2b2aa | publisher = Medscape | date =  | accessdate = 25 January 2013 }}
</ref>

Researchers have recently found an abnormal hypersensitivity to [[GABA]] (the major brain chemical responsible for [[sedation]]) in a large subset of their patients with IH and narcolepsy without cataplexy. They have identified a small (500 to 3000 [[dalton (unit) |daltons]]) naturally-occurring bioactive substance (most likely a [[peptide]] as it is [[trypsin]]-sensitive) in the CSF of afflicted patients. Although this substance requires further identification of its chemical structure, it is currently referred to as a "somnogen" because it has been shown to cause hyper-reactivity of [[GABA-A receptors|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]], which leads to increased sedation or somnolence. The discovery of this abnormality in both patients with IH and patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy lends further credence to the current idea that narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are part of the same disease spectrum.  (See [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Classification|Classification]]). <ref name="2012 Mignot" /> <ref name="ref-orig-13">{{cite journal |title=Modulation of Vigilance in the Primary Hypersomnias by Endogenous Enhancement of GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors |author=D.B.

== Epidemiology ==
Typically, the symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia begin in adolescence or young adulthood, although they can begin at a later age.<ref name="ref-orig-5">{{cite web |url= http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hypersomnia/hypersomnia.htm |title= NINDS Hypersomnia Information Page |accessdate= 2009-01-23 |author= National Institutes of Health |year= 2008 |month= June  |publisher= |pages= |doi=  |quote= }}</ref>  The disorder usually develops slowly over a period of months and years,<ref name="ref-orig-6">{{cite web |url=http://yoursleep.aasmnet.org/disorder.aspx?id=48 |title=Idiopathic Hypersomnia with Long Sleep Time |author= Sharon L. Schutte-Rodin, MD |publisher= American Academy of Sleep Medicine |date= January 12, 2006 |accessdate= }}</ref> often worsening over that period.<ref name="1997 Bassetti" /> Although it is initially progressive, idiopathic hypersomnia is often stable by the time of diagnosis and appears to be a lifelong condition.<ref name="ref-3" /> Spontaneous remission is only seen in 10-15% of patients.<ref name="foundation-about"/>

There is no clear indication of gender predominance,<ref name="ref-1" /> although women may be slightly more affected than men. <ref name="2013 Vecchierini "> {{cite journal | title = Role and actions of the orphan rare diseases reference center for central hypersomnias in France | journal = Revue Neurologique | date = 2013 | last = Vecchierini | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref> Family cases are frequent, in a range from 25% to 66% without any clear mode of inheritance."<ref name="ref-1" />

Idiopathic hypersomnia has long been considered a [[rare disease]] and was believed to be 10 times less frequent than narcolepsy.<ref name="ref-1" />  The prevalence of narcolepsy is known to be about 1 in 2000.<ref name="foundation interview">{{cite web|url=http://hypersomniafoundation.org/research/interview-with-david-rye |title=Hypersomnia Foundation Interview with David Rye |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>  "In Europe and in North America there is now a public health concern about helping patients and families affected by these rare diseases. Due to the complexity of the disease, they often experience difficulties to be diagnosed and often face social and professional consequences."<ref name="ref-5">{{cite journal |title=Socio-professional handicap and accidental risk in patients with hypersomnias of central origin |author=Bayon et al. |year=2009 |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=13 |pages=421–426 }}</ref> (see [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Prognosis|Prognosis]])

Because idiopathic hypersomnia has been considered a rare disease, it has not received enough attention from authorities and researchers. "Patients are rare, researchers and scientists involved in the field are few and research findings are therefore scarce."<ref name="ref-5" />  Because of the absence of a gold standard test for idiopathic hypersomnia and the diagnostic confusion (including the use of many different labels and names), a true prevalence for idiopathic hypersomnia has not, in fact, been determined. Researchers have recently suggested that the prevalence is higher, at least 1 in 800, which translates to about 400,000 in the U.S. alone.<ref name="foundation interview"/>

== Diagnosis ==

Idiopathic hypersomnia has historically been "difficult to diagnose at an early stage," especially because many other disorders can cause symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Therefore, "at the time of presentation, most patients have had the disorder for many years."<ref name="ref-3" />

Further complicating the diagnostic process, idiopathic hypersomnia lacks a clearly-defining clinical feature.  Whereas narcolepsy is associated with [[cataplexy]] and sleep-onset REM episodes, and Kleine-Levin syndrome is associated with megaphagia (compulsive food cravings) and [[hypersexuality]], idiopathic hypersomnia has no such dramatic associated features, except perhaps sleep drunkenness. “Consequently there has been an unfortunate tendency to label all difficult to classify cases of excessive daytime sleepiness as idiopathic hypersomnia.”  For example, [[upper airway resistance syndrome]] and [[delayed sleep phase disorder]] were formerly confused with idiopathic hypersomnia, but now that they have been more clearly defined, one can more carefully exclude these causes of EDS in order to more correctly diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Billiard | first1 = M. | last2 = Dauvilliers | first2 = Y. | title = Idiopathic Hypersomnia. | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–358 | month = Oct | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1053/smrv.2001.0168 | PMID = 12530998 }}</ref> However, “even in the presence of other specific causes of hypersomnia, one should carefully assess the contribution of these etiological factors to the complaint of EDS and when specific treatments of these conditions fail to suppress EDS, the [additional] diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia should be considered.” <ref name="2001 Montplaisir"> {{cite journal | title = Idiopathic hypersomnia: a diagnostic dilemma. A commentary of “Idiopathic hypersomnia” (M. Billiard and Y. Dauvilliers) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | date = 2001 | last = Montplaisir | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref>

In 2001, the ICSD ([[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]]) updated their criteria for the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. Essentially, EDS must be present for at least 6 months, sleep studies ([[polysomnography]] and [[multiple sleep latency test]]) must show certain characteristics, and all other known causes for long sleep time and EDS must be considered (see [[hypersomnia]]).<ref name="ref-3" /> For the patient, this diagnostic process is often tedious, expensive and time-consuming, as other than the sleep studies, it is still basically a [[diagnosis of exclusion]].

In patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, polysomnography typically shows short sleep latency, increased mean slow wave sleep, and a high mean sleep efficiency. “Latency to REM sleep and percentages of light sleep and REM sleep were normal, compared with normal ranges.” <ref name="2007 Anderson"> {{cite journal | title = Idiopathic hypersomnia: A study of 77 Cases | journal = Sleep | date = 2007 | last = Anderson | accessdate = 2013-04-23}}</ref>

It is important to note that although sleep latencies are typically short in idiopathic hypersomnia, the clinical severity may not correlate closely with the [[multiple sleep latency test|MSLT]] results, i.e., shorter sleep latencies do not indicate more severe symptoms.  In fact, “latencies above 5 minutes are not uncommon in patients with clinically severe hypersomnia."<ref name="ref-3" /> When sleep latency is below 10 minutes, the presence of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in two or more of the MSLT naps suggests a diagnosis of narcolepsy, whereas sleep periods lacking rapid eye movement ([[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]]) in the various naps suggests a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia.<ref name="ref-orig-8" /> However, the importance of this differentiation between REM and NREM has been called into question. <ref name="2012 Mignot"/> (see [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Classification|Classification]])

Although the MSLT is currently the best available test to diagnose EDS in general, the MSLT protocol lacks the ability to document the extended, unrefreshing daytime naps that often occur in idiopathic hypersomnia.  Complicating the matter, several groups of researchers have found normal MSLT results in patients who otherwise seem to have idiopathic hypersomnia.  Therefore, when idiopathic hypersomnia is suspected, researchers suggest appending a 24-hour continuous polysomnography to the standard overnight/MSLT study in order to record total sleep time.<ref name="ref-orig-8" />  Alternatively, an assay of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be performed in order to test for an adequate level of [[hypocretin]] (to exclude narcolepsy with cataplexy) and to determine whether the patient’s CSF abnormally boosts GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor sensitivity (thought to underlie many cases of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy without cataplexy).<ref name="foundation-about" /> Globally, there are very few labs capable of performing the CSF assays referenced above.

It is also important to note that whereas narcolepsy is strongly associated with the [[HLA-DQB1]]*0602 [[genotype]], <ref name="2012 Mignot" /> “HLA typing is of no help in the positive diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia.” <ref name="2001 Billiard" />  This is “despite some reports that suggest an increase frequency of HLA Cw2 and DRS in idiopathic hypersomnia subjects.” <ref name="2001 Billiard" />

== Management ==

Currently, there is no cure for idiopathic hypersomnia.  Also, because the underlying disease mechanism is not yet fully understood (see [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Causes|Causes]]), treatment efforts have usually focused on symptom management.  Although there are several FDA-approved medications for use in narcolepsy, there are no FDA-approved medicines for idiopathic hypersomnia.  Therefore, the wake-promoting medications used in narcolepsy are also commonly used [[off-label]] to help manage the excessive daytime sleepiness of idiopathic hypersomnia. “These treatments have not been studied to nearly the same extent in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, and some patients with idiopathic hypersomnia do not achieve adequate control of symptoms with these medications."<ref name="foundation-treatment">{{cite web|url=http://hypersomniafoundation.org/treatment  |title=Hypersomnia Foundation - Treatment |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>

However, current research is raising the possibility of several other potential medication options for idiopathic hypersomnia. "As the brain systems regulating sleepiness and wakefulness are better understood, scientists will be in a better position to design treatments that target key portions of this system."<ref name="foundation-treatment"/>

In addition to medications, “behavioral approaches and [[sleep hygiene]] techniques are recommended, although they have little overall positive impact on this disease.”<ref name="Medscape-treatment">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/291699-treatment |title=Medscape - Treatment |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> “Planned naps are unhelpful, as they are both long and unrefreshing.”<ref name="2007 Anderson"/>
Although behavioral approaches have not been shown to improve EDS, the goal, as in CBT ([[cognitive behavioral therapy]]), is often to help patients learn to reduce their negative emotional responses (e.g. [[frustration]], [[anger]], [[depression_(mood)|depression]]) to their disease symptoms.  Furthermore, because idiopathic hypersomnia "may lead to marriage breakdown, extensive counseling for the patient's partners, educating them about the symptomatology and treatment options, must be part of a comprehensive management plan... Education of relatives, friends, and colleagues helps the patient to function much better with this incurable disease.”<ref name="Medscape Overview#aw2aab6b2b5"/>

Although management of idiopathic hypersomnia is not well codified, it is recommended that initial therapy be conservative, focusing on behavioral modifications and medications such as modafinil and atomoxetine.  However, treatment "may have to be more aggressive (high-dose stimulants, sodium oxybate, etc.) on a case-by-case, empirical trial basis. As cause and evolution are unknown in these conditions, it is important to challenge diagnosis and therapy over time.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>

=== Common off-label medications ===

Overall, the medications currently used for idiopathic hypersomnia (all off-label) are far from satisfactory. CNS stimulants tend to be less effective for idiopathic hypersomnia than they are for narcolepsy and may be less well tolerated.<ref name="ref-orig-8"/>

==== Stimulants ====

There are several stimulants approved by the FDA for treatment of excessive sleepiness due to narcolepsy.  These include [[methylphenidate]] (e.g., Ritalin) and [[dextroamphetamine]], among others. [[Selegiline]] may also be useful, as it is “primarily a metabolic precursor of amphetamine and exerts most of its therapeutic effects through amphetamine metabolism.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/> Increased dopamine release is felt to be the main property explaining wake-promotion from these medications.<ref name="2012 Mignot"/> Although stimulants can effectively reduce sleepiness in the short to medium term, they are rarely effective long-term, as patients frequently become resistant to their effects.  In addition, there are unpleasant potential side effects, which include heart problems, aggressive behavior, and dependence.<ref name="foundation-treatment"/>

==== Wake-promoting medications ====

The non-stimulant wake-promoting medications approved for use in narcolepsy include [[modafinil]] and [[armodafinil]]. Their pharmacology is not completely understood, but these medications “appear to influence brain chemistry that increases wakefulness.”<ref name="foundation-treatment"/> They elevate [[hypothalamic]] [[histamine]] levels,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ishizuka T, Murakami M, Yamatodani A |title=Involvement of central histaminergic systems in modafinil-induced but not methylphenidate-induced increases in locomotor activity in rats |journal=Eur. J. Pharmacol. |volume=578 |issue=2–3 |pages=209–15 |year=2008|month=January |pmid=17920581|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.09.009 |url=}}</ref> and they are known to bind to the dopamine transporter, thereby inhibiting dopamine reuptake. Modafinil can cause uncomfortable side effects, including nausea, headache, and a dry mouth for some patients, while other patients report no noticeable improvement even on relatively high dosages.<ref name="epocrates provigil">{{cite web|url=https://online.epocrates.com/u/10a2276/Provigil
|title=Epocrates - Provigil |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref>   They may also also “interact with low-dose contraceptives, potentially reducing efficacy, although the scientific data supporting this claim is weak and rests on poorly documented anecdotes.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/> New histamine-directed wake-promoting medications are currently under development (see [[Idiopathic hypersomnia#Histamine-directed medications|Histamine-directed medications]]).

[[Caffeine]], an adenosinergic antagonist, is one of the few safe, nondopaminergic wake-promoting compounds. It is widely used but “has intolerable side effects at high doses (including cardiovascular), and it is generally not efficient enough for patients with hypersomnia or narcolepsy.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>

[[Atomoxetine]] (or [[reboxetine]] in Europe) is an adrenergic reuptake inhibitor, which increases wakefulness (generally less strongly than the medications which act on dopamine) and which has a “clear use in the therapeutic arsenal against narcolepsy and hypersomnia although undocumented by clinical trials.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>

Although anti-depressants, in general, have not been found to be helpful for treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia, [[bupropion]] specifically is known to have wake-promoting effects.  “It is a low potency nonspecific monoamine reuptake inhibitor that also has DAT [dopamine-reuptake] inhibitory effects.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>

==== Sodium oxybate ====

[[Sodium oxybate]] is an [[orphan drug]] which was designed specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy.  It has been shown to promote deep sleep and improve daytime sleepiness (as well as cataplexy) in patients with narcolepsy; however, “its effects in those with idiopathic hypersomnia are not well characterized."<ref name="foundation-treatment"/> Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and hallucinations.<ref name="epocrates xyrem">{{cite web|url= https://online.epocrates.com/noFrame/showPage.do?method=drugs&MonographId=1663|title=Epocrates - Xyrem |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref>

There have been a few studies suggesting [[melatonin]] could possibly be helpful in the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>  One small study used a dose of 2 mg slow release melatonin at bedtime and showed 50% of patients with “shortened nocturnal sleep duration, decreased sleep drunkenness and relieved daytime sleepiness.”<ref name="2001 Montplaisir"/>

==== Histamine-directed medications ====

"Based on the role of [[histamine]] in keeping people awake (and hence the common side effect of anti-histamines such as [[diphenhydramine]] causing sleepiness), medications that act on histamine are under development for the treatment of excessive sleepiness."<ref name="foundation-treatment"/> It remains to be seen whether or not these H3 antagonists (i.e., compounds such as [[pitolisant]] that promote the release of the wake-promoting amine histamine) will be particularly useful as wake-promoting agents in the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.<ref name="2012 Mignot"/> 

==== GABA-directed medications ====

Given the possible role of hyper-active GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in idiopathic hypersomnia, medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness.  These currently include [[clarithromycin]] and [[flumazenil]].<ref name="clinicaltrials.gov Flumazenil">{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01183312 |title=Flumazenil for the Treatment of Primary Hypersomnia |author=Lynn Marie Trotti, MD |work=Emory University - Georgia Research Alliance |publisher= ClinicalTrials.gov |date= August 9, 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref><ref name="Clarithro Trial">{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01146600 |title=Clarithromycin for the Treatment of Primary Hypersomnia |author=Lynn Marie Trotti, MD |work=Emory University - Georgia Research Alliance |publisher= ClinicalTrials.gov |date= June 15, 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref>

===== Flumazenil =====
Flumazenil is the only GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist on the market as of Jan 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation.  It is also currently restricted by the FDA for use only in anesthesia reversal and [[benzodiazepine overdose]], so it cannot be prescribed off-label.  However, given its pharmacology, researchers consider it to be a promising medication in the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.  Results of a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial were published in November 2012.  This research showed that flumazenil provides relief for most patients whose CSF contains the unknown "somnogen" that enhances the function of [[GABA-A receptors|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]], making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of GABA. For one patient, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years.<ref name="ref-orig-13">{{cite journal |title=Modulation of Vigilance in the Primary Hypersomnias by Endogenous Enhancement of GABAA Receptors |author=D.B. Rye, D.L. Bliwise, K. Parker, L.M. Trotti, P. Saini, J. Fairley, A. Freeman, P.S. Garcia, M.J. Owens, J.C. Ritchie and A. Jenkins |journal=Sci. Transl.

===== Clarithromycin =====
In a test tube model, clarithromycin (an antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of infections) was found to return the function of the GABA system to normal in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia.  Investigators therefore treated a few patients with off-label clarithromycin, and most felt their symptoms improved with this treatment.  In order to help further determine whether clarithromycin is truly beneficial for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia, a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was completed in 2012.  Results have not yet been published.<ref name="Clarithro Trial"/> “It is important to note that the positive effect of clarithromycin is secondary to a benzodiazepine antagonist-like effect, not its antibiotic effects, and treatment must be maintained.”<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>

==== Hypocretin agonists ====

Hypocretin-1 has been shown to be strongly wake-promoting in animal models, but it unfortunately does not cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, companies are currently developing hypocretin receptor antagonists, like [[almorexant]], which is awaiting FDA approval for the treatment of insomnia.  It is also likely that a hypocretin-1 agonist will be found and developed for the treatment of hypersomnia.<ref name="2012 Mignot"/>

== Prognosis ==
Idiopathic hypersomnia is a lifelong disorder (with only rare spontaneous remissions) whose symptoms typically begin in adolescence or young adulthood.  It is initially progressive, but may stabilize, and its main consequences are professional and social.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/291699-overview | title = Primary Hypersomnia | accessdate = 2013-01-29}}</ref> <ref name="ref-3" />

Idiopathic hypersomnia profoundly affects work, education, and quality of life.  Patients are often too sleepy to work or attend school regularly, and they are predisposed "to develop serious performance decrements in multiple areas of function as well as to potentially life-threatening domestic, work-related and driving accidents."<ref name="ref-5" /> Furthermore, these risks are higher for idiopathic hypersomnia patients than for those with sleep apnea or severe insomnia.  In fact, "the most severe cases of daytime somnolence are found in patients affected by narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia."<ref name="ref-5" /> And idiopathic hypersomnia is often as, if not more, disabling than narcolepsy;<ref name="ref-3" /> surprisingly, excessive daytime sleepiness is even more handicapping than the cataplectic attacks of narcolepsy.<ref name="ref-5" />

Due to the consequences of their profound EDS, both idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy can often result in unemployment.  Several studies have shown a high rate of unemployment in narcoleptics (from 30-59%), which was felt to be related to the severe symptoms of their illness.<ref name="ref-6">Gosmany M.

"The socio-economic impact of narcolepsy." Sleep 2004;27:1123–8</ref>

== Society and culture ==
Idiopathic hypersomnia is rarely in the public eye and has a very low level of public awareness.

Because of this low awareness, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia “often need significant support because they are at risk of being misunderstood as being incompetent or slothful. Therefore, education of relatives, friends, and colleagues helps the patient to function much better with this incurable disease.”<ref name="Medscape Overview#aw2aab6b2b5">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/291699-overview#aw2aab6b2b5
