'''Tonsillitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[tonsil]]s most commonly caused by viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms may include [[sore throat]] and [[fever]]. When caused by a bacterium belonging to the [[group A streptococcus]], it is typically referred to as [[strep throat]]. The overwhelming majority of people recover completely with or without medication. In 40%, symptoms will resolve in three days, and within one week in 85% of people, regardless of whether streptococcal infection is present or not.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Antibiotics for sore throat | author=Del Mar CB, Glasziou PP, Spinks AB | date=2006 Oct | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume=18;(4) | pmid=17054126 | issue=4 | pages=CD000023 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000023.pub3 | editor1-last=Del Mar | editor1-first=Chris B }}</ref>

==Causes==
The most common cause is viral infection and includes [[adenovirus]], [[rhinovirus]], [[influenza]], [[coronavirus]], and [[respiratory syncytial virus]].<ref name=merck/><ref name=wetmore/><ref name=thuma/><ref name=simon/> It can also be caused by [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[herpes simplex virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]], or [[HIV]].<ref name=merck/><ref name=wetmore/><ref name=thuma/><ref name=simon/>  The second most common cause is bacterial infection of which the predominant is Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus ([[GABHS]]), which causes [[strep throat]].<ref name=merck/><ref name=wetmore/><ref name=thuma/><ref name=simon/>  Less common bacterial causes include: ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA ),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brook |first=I. |last2=Foote |first2=P.

[[Anaerobic bacteria]] have been implicated in tonsillitis and a possible role in the acute inflammatory process is supported by several clinical and scientific observations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brook |first=I. |title=The role of anaerobic bacteria in tonsillitis |journal=Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol |year=2005 |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=9–19 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2004.08.007 |pmid=15627441 }}</ref>

Under normal circumstances, as viruses and bacteria enter the body through the nose and mouth, they are filtered in the [[tonsil]]s.<ref name="Kempen"/><ref name="Perry"/> Within the tonsils, [[white blood cell]]s of the immune system destroy the viruses or bacteria by producing inflammatory cytokines like [[Phospholipase A2]],<ref>{{cite journal | title = Circulating phospholipase-A2 activity in obstructive sleep apnea | journal = International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology | year = 2012 | id =  | doi = 10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.12.026 | pmid=22297210 | last1 = Ezzeddini | first1 = Rana | last2 = Darabi | first2 = Masoud | last3 = Ghasemi | first3 = Babollah | last4 = Jabbari | first4 = Yalda | last5 = Abdollahi | first5 = Shahin | last6 = Rashtchizadeh | first6 = Nadereh | last7 = Gharahdaghi | first7 = Abasaad | last8 = Darabi | first8 = Maryam | last9 = Ansarin | first9 = Masoud | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–4}}</ref> which also lead to fever.<ref name="Kempen">{{cite journal |author=van Kempen MJ, Rijkers GT, Van Cauwenberge PB |title=The immune response in adenoids and tonsils |journal=Int.

Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by an [[infection]] of [[spirochaeta]] and [[treponema]], in this case called [[Trench mouth|Vincent's angina]] or Plaut-Vincent angina.<ref name="pmid1015288">{{cite journal |author=Van Cauwenberge P |title=[Significance of the fusospirillum complex (Plaut-Vincent angina)] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Acta Otorhinolaryngol Belg |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=334–45 |year=1976 |pmid=1015288 }} — fusospirillum complex (Plaut-Vincent angina) Van Cauwenberge studied the tonsils of 126 patients using direct microscope observation.  The results showed that 40% of acute tonsillitis was caused by Vincent's angina and 27% of chronic tonsillitis was caused by Spirochaeta</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of GABHS tonsillitis can be confirmed by culture of samples obtained by swabbing both tonsillar surfaces and the posterior pharyngeal wall and plating them on sheep [[blood agar]] medium.  The isolation rate can be increased by incubating the cultures under [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions and using [[growth media|selective growth media]]. A single throat culture has a sensitivity of 90%-95% for the detection of GABHS (which means that GABHS is actually present 5%-10% of the time culture suggests that it is absent). This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the patient has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10–60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85-90%, are available. Older antigen tests detect the surface Lancefield group A carbohydrate. Newer tests identify GABHS serotypes using nucleic acid (DNA) probes or [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction.]] Bacterial culture may need to be performed in cases of a negative rapid streptococcal test.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Leung AK, Newman R, Kumar A, Davies HD | year = 2006 | title = Rapid antigen detection testing in diagnosing group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis | url = | journal = Expert Rev Mol Diagn | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 761–6 | doi = 10.1586/14737159.6.5.761 | pmid = 17009909 }}</ref>

True infection with GABHS, rather than colonization, is defined arbitrarily as the presence of >10 colonies of GABHS per blood agar plate. However, this method is difficult to implement because of the overlap between carriers and infected patients. An increase in antistreptolysin O ([[Anti-streptolysin O|ASO]]) streptococcal antibody titer 3–6 weeks following the acute infection can provide retrospective evidence of GABHS infection<ref name="BrookOvercoming">{{cite journal | author = Brook I | year = 2007 | title = Overcoming penicillin failures in the treatment of Group A streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis | url = | journal = Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol | volume = 71 | issue = 10| pages = 1501–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.06.006 | pmid = 17644191 }}</ref> and is considered definitive proof of GABHS infection.

If the tonsillitis is caused by [[Streptococus#Group_A|group A streptococus]], then [[antibiotics]] are useful with [[penicillin]] or [[amoxicillin]] being primary choices.<ref name="pmid1459378">{{cite journal |author=Touw-Otten FW, Johansen KS |title=Diagnosis, antibiotic treatment and outcome of acute tonsillitis: report of a WHO Regional Office for Europe study in 17 European countries |journal=Fam Pract |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=255–62 |year=1992 |pmid=1459378 |doi=10.1093/fampra/9.3.255}}</ref> Cephalosporins and macrolides are considered good alternatives to penicillin in the acute setting.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Casey JR, Pichichero ME | year = 2004 | title = Meta-analysis of cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 4| pages = 866–882 | doi = 10.1542/peds.113.4.866 | pmid = 15060239 }}</ref> A [[macrolide]] such as [[erythromycin]] is used for people allergic to penicillin.

When tonsillitis is caused by a virus, the length of illness depends on which virus is involved. Usually, a complete recovery is made within one week; however, symptoms may last for up to two weeks. [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] cases may be treated with [[tonsillectomy]] (surgical removal of tonsils) as a choice for treatment.<ref name="pmid6700642">{{cite journal |author=Paradise JL, Bluestone CD, Bachman RZ, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in severely affected children.

==Prognosis==
Since the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, a major preoccupation in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis has been the prevention of [[rheumatic fever]], and its major effects on the nervous system ([[Sydenham's chorea]]) and heart. Recent evidence would suggest that the rheumatogenic strains of group A beta hemolytic strep have become markedly less prevalent and are now only present in small pockets such as in Salt Lake City.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Temporal changes in streptococcal M protein types and the near-disappearance of acute rheumatic fever in the United States | author=Shulman ST, Stollerman G, Beall B, Dale JB, Tanz RR | date=2006 Feb 15 | journal=Clin Infect Dis | volume=42 | pages=441–7 | pmid=16421785 | doi=10.1086/499812| issue=4}}</ref> This brings into question the rationale for treating tonsillitis as a means of preventing rheumatic fever.

Complications may rarely include dehydration and kidney failure due to difficulty swallowing, blocked airways due to inflammation, and [[pharyngitis]] due to the spread of infection.<ref name=merck/><ref name=wetmore/><ref name=thuma/><ref name=simon/><ref name=medline/>

An [[abscess]] may develop lateral to the tonsil during an infection, typically several days after the onset of tonsillitis. This is termed a [[peritonsillar abscess]] (or quinsy).
Rarely, the infection may spread beyond the tonsil resulting in inflammation and infection of the internal jugular vein giving rise to a spreading [[septicaemia]] infection ([[Lemierre's syndrome]]).

In chronic/recurrent cases (generally defined as seven episodes of tonsillitis in the preceding year, five episodes in each of the preceding two years or three episodes in each of the preceding three years),<ref>{{cite book | title=Management of Sore Throat and Indications for Tonsillectomy | url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/34/index.html | chapter=6.3 Referral Criteria for Tonsillectomy | chapterurl=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/34/section6.html | publisher=[http://www.sign.ac.uk Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network] | isbn=1-899893-66-0 | year=1999 | month=January | author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.}} — notes though that these criteria "have been arrived at arbitrarily" from:<br>{{cite journal |author=Paradise JL, Bluestone CD, Bachman RZ, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in severely affected children.
