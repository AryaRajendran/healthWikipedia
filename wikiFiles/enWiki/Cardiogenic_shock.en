Since this is a type of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] there is insufficient [[perfusion]] of [[Biological tissue|tissue]] (i.e. the [[heart]]) to meet the required demands for [[oxygen]] and [[nutrients]].

Cardiogenic shock is defined by sustained [[hypotension]] with tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate left ventricular filling pressure.  Signs of tissue hypoperfusion include [[oliguria]] (<30 mL/h), cool extremities, and altered level of consciousness.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Anxiety, restlessness, [[Glasgow Coma Scale|altered mental state]] due to decreased cerebral perfusion and subsequent [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].
* Hypotension due to decrease in [[cardiac output]].
* A rapid, weak, thready pulse due to decreased circulation combined with tachycardia.
* Cool, clammy, and mottled skin ([[cutis marmorata]]), due to vasoconstriction and subsequent hypoperfusion of the skin.
* Distended [[jugular vein]]s due to increased jugular venous pressure.
* Oliguria (low urine output) due to insufficient renal perfusion if condition persists.
* Rapid and deep respirations (hyperventilation) due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and acidosis.
* Fatigue due to hyperventilation and hypoxia.
* Absent pulse in tachy[[arrhythmia]].
* [[Pulmonary edema]], involving fluid back-up in the lungs due to insufficient pumping of the heart.
==Cause==
Cardiogenic shock is caused by the failure of the heart to pump effectively.  It can be due to damage to the [[heart]] muscle, most often from a large [[myocardial infarction]].  Other causes include [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], [[cardiomyopathy]],[[cardiac valve]] problems, ventricular outflow obstruction (i.e. [[aortic valve stenosis]], [[aortic dissection]], systolic anterior motion (SAM) in [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]) or ventriculoseptal defects.<ref name="IrwinRippe"/><ref name="Marino"/><ref name="FCCS"/><ref name="InternalMedicine"/><ref name="Overview"/><ref name="HongKongCS">

==Diagnosis==
=== Electrocardiogram ===
An [[ECG|electrocardiogram]] helps establishing the exact diagnosis and guides treatment, it may reveal:
* [[Cardiac arrhythmia]]s
* Signs of [[cardiomyopathy]]

===Ultrasound===
[[Echocardiography]] may show poor ventricular function, signs of PED, [[ventricular septal rupture]] (VSR), an obstructed outflow tract or cardiomyopathy.

===Swan-ganz catheter===
The [[Swan-ganz catheter]] or pulmonary artery catheter may assist in the diagnosis by providing information on the [[hemodynamics]].

===Biopsy===
In case of suspected cardiomyopathy a [[biopsy]] of heart muscle may be needed to make a definite [[diagnosis]]. but biopsy should only be done when third space is suspected

==Treatment==
In cardiogenic shock: depending on the type of myocardial infarction, treatment involves infusion of fluids, or in shock refractory to fluids, [[inotrope|inotropic]] medications.  In case of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] several anti-arrhythmic agents may be administered, i.e. [[adenosine]], [[verapamil]] (source is outdated - verapamil is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock), [[amiodarone]], [[Beta blocker|β-blocker]] or [[glucagon]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hall-Boyer K, Zaloga GP, Chernow B |title=Glucagon: hormone or therapeutic agent? |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=584–9 |year=1984 |month=July |pmid=6375966 |doi=10.1097/00003246-198407000-00008}}</ref>  Positive [[inotrope|inotropic]] agents, which enhance the heart's pumping capabilities, are used to improve the contractility and correct the hypotension.  Should that not suffice an [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] (which reduces [[afterload|workload]] for the heart, and improves perfusion of the [[coronary arteries]]) can be considered or a left [[ventricular assist device]] (which augments the pump-function of the heart).<ref name="IrwinRippe"/><ref name="Marino"/><ref name="FCCS"/> Finally, as a last resort, if the patient can be made  stable enough and otherwise qualifies, [[cardiac transplantation]] can be performed. These invasive measures are important tools- more than 50% of patients who do not die immediately due to cardiac arrest from a lethal arrthythmia and live to reach the hospital (who have usually suffered a severe acute myocardial infarction, which in itself still has a relatively high mortality rate), die within the first 24 hours. The mortality rate for those still living at time of admission who suffer complications (among others, cardiac arrest or further arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiac tamponade, a ruptured or dissecting aneurysm, or another heart attack) from cardiogenic shock is even worse around 85%, especially without drastic measures such as ventricular assist devices or transplantation.

Cardiogenic shock may be treated with intravenous [[dobutamine]], which acts on β<sub>1</sub> receptors of the heart leading to increased contractility and heart rate.
