'''Social neuroscience''' is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how [[biological system]]s implement social processes and [[behavior]], and to using biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social processes and behavior. [[Humans]] are fundamentally a social species, rather than individualists. As such, [[Homo sapiens]] create [[emergent organization]]s beyond the individualâ€”structures that range from dyads, families, and groups to cities, civilizations, and cultures. These emergent structures evolved hand in hand with [[neural]] and [[hormonal]] mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long that they too survived to reproduce. The term "social neuroscience" can be traced to a publication entitled "Social Neuroscience Bulletin" that was published quarterly between 1988 and 1994.  The term was subsequently popularized in an article by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Gary Berntson]], published in [[the American Psychologist]] in 1992.<ref>Cacioppo, J. T., & Berntson, G. G. (1992). Social psychological contributions to the decade of the brain: Doctrine of multilevel analysis. ''American Psychologist'', 47, 1019-1028.</ref> Cacioppo and Berntson are considered as the legitimate fathers of social neuroscience. Still a young field, social neuroscience is closely related to [[affective neuroscience]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], focusing on how the [[brain]] mediates [[social interaction]]s.<ref>Cacioppo, J. T., Berntson, G. G., & Decety, J. (2010). Social neuroscience and its relation to social psychology. Social Cognition, 28, 675-684</ref>

==Overview==
Traditional [[neuroscience]] has for many years considered the [[nervous system]] as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of the social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fact, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the operations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individual through a continuous interplay of neural, [[neuroendocrine]], [[metabolic]] and [[Immune system|immune]] factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulatory organ and also a malleable target of these factors.<ref>Cacioppo, J. T., Berntson, G. G., & Decety, J. (2011). A history of social neuroscience. In A. W. Kruglanski and W. Stroebe (Eds.), Handbook of the History of Social Psychology. New York: Psychology Press.</ref> Social neuroscience investigates the [[mechanism (biology)|biological mechanisms]] that underlie social processes and behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the [[neuroscience]]s in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of [[biology]] to develop [[scientific theories|theories]] of social processes and behavior in the social and [[behavioral sciences]]. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organization and function.<ref>Cacioppo, J.T. et al.

Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to the development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementary relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the social and biological domains (e.g., [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cellular biology|cellular]], [[Systems biology|system]], person, relational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.

==Methods==
A number of methods are used in social neuroscience to investigate the confluence of [[nervous system|neural]] and social processes (drawing from behavioral techniques developed in [[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[neuropsychology]]), associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], [[event-related potential]]s, [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[electromyogram]]s, [[endocrinology]], [[galvanic skin response]], and studies of [[Ataxia#Focal lesions|focal brain lesion]] patients.<ref>Adolphs, R. (2003). Investigating the cognitive neuroscience of social behavior. Neuropsychologia, 41, 119-126.</ref><ref>Cacioppo, J.T., & Berntson, G.G. (2009), Handbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral Science. New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref><ref>Harmon-Jones, E., & Beer, J.S. (2009). Methods in Social Neuroscience. New York: The Guilford Press</ref> Animal models are also important to investigate the putative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes (e.g., the [[reward system]] and [[drug addiction]]). In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior associations.<ref>de Haan, M., & Gunnar, M.R.

==Society for social neuroscience==
A dinner to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of social neuroscience at the [[Society for Neuroscience]] meeting ([[Chicago]], November 2009) resulted in a series of meetings led by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Jean Decety]] with social neuroscientists, [[psychologists]], [[neuroscientist]]s, [[psychiatrists]] and [[neurologist]]s in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Social neuroscience was defined broadly as the interdisciplinary study of the neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the emergent structures that define social species. Thus, among the participants in these meetings were scientists who used a wide variety of methods in studies of animals as well as humans, and patients as well as normal participants. The consensus also emerged that a Society for Social Neuroscience should be established to give scientists from diverse disciplines and perspectives the opportunity to meet, communicate with, and benefit from the work of each other. The international, interdisciplinary [[Society for social neuroscience]] (http://S4SN.org) was launched at the conclusion of these consultations in [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 20 January 2010, and the inaugural meeting for the Society was held on November 12, 2010, the day prior to the 2010 Society for Neuroscience meeting ([[San Diego]], CA).
