The '''Standardized Uptake Value''' (SUV) is often used in [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] imaging for a simple semi-quantitative analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1097/01.mnm.0000134329.30912.49 | author=G. Lucignani, G. Paganelli, E. Bombardieri | title=The use of standardized uptake values for assessing FDG uptake with PET in oncology: A clinical perspective| journal=Nuclear Medicine Communications| year=2004| volume=25| pages=651–656 | pmid=15208491}}</ref> An example is the analysis of [[fluorodeoxyglucose|[<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose]] ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG) images for cancer therapy monitoring. It can also be used with other [[Radioactive tracer|PET agents]] especially when no arterial input function is available for more detailed [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] modeling. If the arterial input function is available, commonly via blood sampling but also via advanced image analysis techniques, other measures like the [[Fractional Uptake Rate]] are preferable, or more advanced pharmacokinetic modeling may be undertaken.

The SUV is calculated either pixel-wise or over a [[region of interest]] (ROI) for each image of a dynamic series at time points ''t''. It is the ratio of (1) tissue radioactivity concentration (e.g. in MBq/kg=kBq/g) at time ''t'', ''c(t)'', and (2) the ''injected activity'' (e.g. in MBq) at the time of injection (''t''=0) divided by the ''body weight'' (e.g. in kg):

<math>SUV(t) = \frac {c(t)}{injected\ activity \quad / \quad body\ weight}</math>

In other words, the SUV represents the ratio of (1) the actual radioactivity concentration found in a selected part of the body at a certain time point, and (2) the radioactivity concentration in the hypothetical case of an even distribution of the injected radioactivity across the whole body. Here, the difference between ''c(t)'' measured per volume (as in images) or per weight (as indicated by the unit MBq/kg above) is ignored assuming that in case of soft tissues the [[mass density]] is approximately 1 kg/L. Moreover, both radioactivity measures ''c(t)'' and ''injected activity'' are corrected for the physical decay of the radioisotope to the same time point (e.g. time of injection).

Some authors prefer to use the lean body weight<ref>{{cite journal | author=K. R. Zasadny and R. L. Wahl | title=Standardized uptake values of normal tissues at PET with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose: variations with body weight and a method for correction | journal=Radiology | year=1993 | volume=189 | pages=847–850}}</ref> or the body surface area<ref>{{cite journal | author=C. K. Kim, N. C. Gupta, B. Chandramouli, and A. Alavi | title=Standardized uptake values of FDG: body surface area correction is preferable to body weight correction | journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine | year=1994 | volume=35 | pages=164–167}}</ref> instead of the body weight. Also for ''c(t)'' often either the maximum or the mean value of a ROI is taken,<ref>{{cite web | author=Vesa Oikonen | title=Standardized uptake rate (SUV) | url = http://www.turkupetcentre.net/modelling/methods/suv.html | accessdate = 2009-07-22}}</ref>  and further modifications like additional thresholds may be employed.

SUVs can be affected by image noise, low image resolution and user biased ROI selection.<ref>{{cite journal | author=R. Boellaard, N. C. Krak, O. S. Hoekstra, A. A. Lammertsma | title=Effects of noise, image resolution, and ROI definition on the accuracy of standard uptake values: a simulation study | journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine | year=2004 | volume=45 | pages=1519–1527 | pmid=15347719}}</ref> For the semi-quantitative analysis of [[Fluorodeoxyglucose|[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG]] uptake in tissue or tumor, several corrections have been recommended (see <ref>{{cite journal | author=S.-C. Huang | title=Anatomy of SUV | journal=Nuclear Medicine and Biology | year=2000 | volume=27 | pages=643–646}}</ref> and references therein). The SUV concept has been only begun to be tested in connection with other radiotracers like [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorothymidine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FLT) and conclusions on its usefulness and robustness in these cases might be premature.<ref>{{cite journal | author=R. J. Hicks | title=The SUV and FLT PET: A tasty alphabet soup or a dog’s breakfast? | journal=Leukemia and Lymphoma | year=2007 | volume=48 | pages=649–652 | pmid=17454619}}</ref>

In summary, SUVs are a convenient measure for the evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET images, but care has to be taken with respect to its pitfalls and interpretation of the results.
