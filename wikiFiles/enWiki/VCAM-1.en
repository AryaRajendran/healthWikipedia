'''Vascular cell adhesion protein 1''' also known as '''vascular cell adhesion molecule 1''' (VCAM-1) or '''cluster of differentiation 106''' (CD106) is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''VCAM1'' [[gene]].<ref name="Cybulsky_1991">{{cite journal | author = Cybulsky M, Fries JW, Williams AJ, Sultan P, Eddy RL, Byers MG, Shows TB, Gimbrone MA Jr, Collins T | title = The human VCAM1 gene is assigned to chromosome 1p31-p32 | journal=Cytogenet. Cell Genet. | year = 1991 | volume = 58 | pages = 1852 |doi=10.1159/000133735}}</ref> VCAM-1 functions as a [[cell adhesion molecule]].

==Structure==

The VCAM-1 gene contains six or seven [[immunoglobulin]] domains, and is expressed on both large and small [[blood vessel]]s only after the [[endothelial]] cells are stimulated by [[cytokine]]s. It is [[Alternative splicing|alternatively spliced]] into two known [[RNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcripts]] that encode different isoforms in humans.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: VCAM1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=7412| accessdate = }}</ref> The gene product is a cell surface [[sialoglycoprotein]], a type I membrane protein that is a member of the [[Immunoglobulin superfamily|Ig superfamily]].

==Function==

The VCAM-1 protein mediates the adhesion of [[lymphocyte]]s, [[monocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, and [[basophil]]s to vascular [[endothelium]]. It also functions in leukocyte-endothelial cell [[signal transduction]], and it may play a role in the development of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. 

Upregulation of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells by cytokines occurs as a result of increased [[gene transcription]] (e.g., in response to [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNF-α) and [[Interleukin-1]] (IL-1)) and through stabilization of [[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA) (e.g., [[Interleukin-4]] (IL-4)). The promoter region of the VCAM-1 gene contains functional tandem [[NF-κB]] (nuclear factor-kappa B) sites. The sustained expression of VCAM-1 lasts over 24 hours. 

Primarily, the VCAM-1 protein is an endothelial [[ligand]] for [[VLA-4]] (Very Late Antigen-4 or α4β1) of the β1 subfamily of [[integrin]]s, and for integrin α4β7. VCAM-1 expression has also been observed in other cell types (e.g., [[smooth muscle cells]]). It has also been shown to [[Protein-protein_interaction|interact]] with [[ezrin|EZR]]<ref name=pmid12082081>{{cite journal |last=Barreiro |first=Olga |authorlink= |coauthors=Yanez-Mo Maria, Serrador Juan M, Montoya Maria C, Vicente-Manzanares Miguel, Tejedor Reyes, Furthmayr Heinz, Sanchez-Madrid Francisco |year=2002|month=Jun. |title=Dynamic interaction of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 with moesin and ezrin in a novel endothelial docking structure for adherent leukocytes |journal=J.

==Pharmacology==
Certain [[melanoma]] cells can use VCAM-1 to adhere to the endothelium, and VCAM-1 may participate in monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic sites. As a result, VCAM-1 is a potential [[drug]] target.
