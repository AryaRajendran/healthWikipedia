'''Tube dependency''' is an unintended result of long-term feeding by enteral nutrition in [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s.<ref name="Dunitz-Scheer, M. et al.,2009">M. Dunitz-Scheer et al.: ''Prevention and Treatment of Tube Dependency in Infancy and Early Childhood.'' In: ''Infant, Child, & Adolescent Nutrition.'' 1(2), 2009, S. 73-82.</ref>

== Affects ==
Tube dependency can be seen as an [[iatrogenic]]factor which causes physical symptoms, psychological [[stress (biology)|stress]] and emotional dependency on tube feeding ([[feeding tube]]) in absence of any medical indication. , it is often not recognized as a diagnosis or complication by medical professionals.<ref name="Dunitz-Scheer, M. et al.,2009" />  There are several types of temporary feeding tubes [(nostril ([[Nasogastric tube]]) or directly into the stomach ([[Gastrostomy]]) or [[intestinal]] (Jejunal tube)] placed, which were intended to last for a short period of a few months which are commonly placed without offering a specific therapeutic support or a specific exit-strategy. Infants and toddlers are not able to make the transition to oral nutrition, as they develop an active aversion to or a disinterest in food.

==Tube weaning==

Unfortunately, there is only limited literature on the topic of tube weaning.<ref name="Dunitz-Scheer, M. et al.,2009" /> McGrath, Schurle, Bruce, Mangiaracina, Schulz und Hyman<ref name="McGrath et al.,2009">D. McGrath, A. Schurle, A. Bruce, C. Mangiaracina, T. Schulz, P. Hyman: ''Moving from tube to oral feeding in medically fragile nonverbal toddlers.In: Journal of Peadiatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.'' 49, 2009, S. 233-236.</ref> assume a ''pain rehabilitation'' ''Kursiver Text''approach. In their study, tube fed children were treated with medication (neuroleptics and analgetics), because the authors were of the opinion that food intake leads to pain in children. In summary the authors<ref name="McGrath et al.,2009"/> examined nine tube fed children between 7 and 52 months. 82% of the sample was successfully weaned.
On the contrary, Benoit, Wang und Zlotkin<ref name="Benoit, D. et al.,2000">D. Benoit, E. Wang, S.H. Zlotkin: ''Discontinuation of enterostomy tube feeding by behavioral treatment in early childhood: A randomized controlled trial.'' In: ''The Journal of Pediatrics.'' 137, 2000, S. 498-503.</ref>  showed a behavioral approach and used methods from behavioral therapy. Benoit et al.<ref name="Benoit, D. et al.,2000"/> successfully weaned 15 (47%) of a total sample of 32 tube fed infants.
Another tube weaning approach is called the “graz tube weaning model”.
