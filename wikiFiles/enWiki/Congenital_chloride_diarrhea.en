'''Congenital chloride diarrhea''' ('''CCD''', also '''congenital chloridorrhea''') is a [[genetic disorder]] due to an [[Dominance relationship|autosomal recessive mutation]] on [[chromosome 7]].  The mutation is in [[downregulated-in-adenoma]] (DRA), a gene that encodes a [[membrane protein]] of [[Enterocyte|intestinal cells]].  The protein belongs to the [[solute carrier family|solute carrier 26 family]] of [[membrane transport protein]]s.<ref name="pmid18400693">{{cite journal

==Pathophysiology==
CCD causes persistent secretory diarrhea.  In a [[fetus]], it leads to [[polyhydramnios]] and [[premature birth]].  Immediately after birth, it leads to [[dehydration]], [[hypoelectrolytemia]], [[hyperbilirubinemia]], [[abdominal distention]], and [[failure to thrive]].<ref name="pmid12442266">{{cite journal

An important feature in this [[diarrhea]] that helps in the diagnosis, is that its the only type of diarrhea that causes [[metabolic alkalosis]] rather than [[metabolic acidosis]].

==Treatment==
Available treatments address the symptoms of CCD, not the underlying defect.  Early diagnosis and aggressive salt replacement therapy result in normal growth and development, and generally good outcomes.  Replacement of [[NaCl]] and [[KCl]] has been shown to be effective in children.<ref name="pmid16641574">{{cite journal

==History==
Observations leading to the characterization of the SLC26 family were based on research on rare human diseases.  Three rare recessive diseases in humans have been shown to be caused by genes of this family.  [[Diastrophic dysplasia]], congenital chloride diarrhea, and [[Pendred syndrome]] are caused by the highly related genes [[SLC26A2]] (first called DTDST), [[SLC26A3]] (first called CLD or DRA), and [[SLC26A4]] (first called PDS), respectively.<ref name="pmid17120758">{{cite journal
