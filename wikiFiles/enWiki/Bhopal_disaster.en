The '''Bhopal disaster''', also referred to as the '''Bhopal gas tragedy''', was a [[gas leak]] incident in [[India]], considered [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Industrial disasters|the world's worst]] [[List of industrial disasters|industrial disaster]].<ref name="convictions">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm|title=Bhopal trial: Eight convicted over India gas disaster |date=7 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-06-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100607185745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm| archivedate= 7 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It occurred on the night of 2–3 December 1984 at the [[Union Carbide India Limited]] (UCIL) [[pesticide]] plant in [[Bhopal]], Madhya Pradesh.

UCIL was the Indian subsidiary of [[Union Carbide]] Corporation (UCC), with Indian Government controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1994, the Supreme Court of India allowed UCC to sell its 50.9 percent interest in UCIL to [[Eveready Industries India|Eveready Industries India Limited]] (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. Eveready Industries India, Limited, ended cleanup on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. [[Dow Chemical Company]] purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.

Civil and criminal cases are pending in the [[District Courts of India|District Court]] of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and [[Warren Anderson (chairman)|Warren Anderson]], UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=New York Times |title=Company Defends Chief in Bhopal Disaster |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/company-defends-chief-in-bhopal-disaster/ | date=3 August 2009 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=U.S. Exec Arrest Sought in Bhopal Disaster |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/31/world/main5201155.shtml | date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> In June 2010, seven ex-employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by [[Law of India|Indian law]]. An eighth former employee was also convicted, but died before the judgment was passed.<ref name="convictions" />

==The pre-event phase==
The UCIL factory was built in 1969 to produce the pesticide Sevin (UCC's brand name for [[carbaryl]]) using [[methyl isocyanate|methyl isocyanate (MIC)]] as an intermediate.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> A MIC production plant was added in 1979.<ref name="UCCmanual1976">UCC manual (1976).</ref><ref name="UCCmanual1978">UCC manual (1978).</ref><ref name="UCCmanual1979">UCC manual (1979).</ref> After the Bhopal plant was built, other manufacturers including [[Bayer]] produced carbaryl without MIC, though at a greater [[manufacturing cost]]. However, Bayer also uses the UCC process at the chemical plant once owned by UCC at Institute, [[West Virginia]], USA.<ref name="Kovel">Kovel (2002).</ref>

The chemical process employed in the Bhopal plant had [[methylamine]] reacting with [[phosgene]] to form MIC, which was then reacted with [[1-naphthol]] to form the final product, carbaryl. This "route" differed from the MIC-free routes used elsewhere, in which the same raw materials were combined in a different manufacturing order, with phosgene first reacting with naphthol to form a chloroformate ester, which was then reacted with methylamine. In the early 1980s, the demand for pesticides had fallen, but production continued, leading to buildup of stores of unused MIC.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Kovel" />

===Earlier leaks===
In 1976, two trade unions complained of pollution within the plant.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006" /> In 1981, a worker was splashed with [[phosgene]]. In a panic, he removed his mask, inhaling a large amount of phosgene gas which resulted in his death 72 hours later.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006" /> UCC was warned by American experts who visited the plant after 1981 of the potential of a "[[Thermal runaway|runaway reaction]]" in the MIC  storage tank. Local Indian authorities had warned the company of the problem as early as 1979, but constructive actions were not undertaken by UCIC at that time.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Kovel" />
In January 1982, a phosgene leak exposed 24 workers, all of whom were admitted to a hospital. None of the workers had been ordered to wear protective masks. One month later, in February 1982, a MIC  leak affected 18 workers.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006" /> In August 1982, a chemical engineer came into contact with liquid MIC, resulting in burns over 30 percent of his body.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006" /> Later that same year, in October 1982, there was another MIC leak. In attempting to stop the leak, the MIC supervisor suffered intensive chemical burns and two other workers were severely exposed to the gases.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006" /> During 1983 and 1984, there were leaks of MIC, chlorine, monomethylamine, phosgene, and [[carbon tetrachloride]], sometimes in combination.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006" />

===Contributing factors===
Factors leading to the magnitude of the gas leak mainly included problems such as; storing MIC in large tanks and filling beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production at the end of 1984, failure of several safety systems due to poor maintenance, and safety systems being switched off to save money— including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity. The situation was worsened by the mushrooming of slums in the vicinity of the plant, non-existent catastrophe plans, and shortcomings in health care and socio-economic rehabilitation.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /> 

Other factors identified by the inquiry included: use of a more dangerous pesticide manufacturing method, large-scale MIC storage, plant location close to a densely populated area, undersized safety devices, and the dependence on manual operations.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> Plant management deficiencies were also identified&nbsp;– lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Eckerman2006">Eckerman (2006)</ref>

===Work conditions===
Attempts to reduce expenses affected the factory's employees and their conditions. Kurzman argues that "cuts...meant less stringent quality control and thus looser safety rules. A pipe leaked? Don't replace it, employees said they were told&nbsp;... MIC workers needed more training? They could do with less. Promotions were halted, seriously affecting employee morale and driving some of the most skilled&nbsp;... elsewhere".<ref name="Kurzman1987">Kurzman (1987).</ref> Workers were forced to use English manuals, even though only a few had a grasp of the language.<ref name="Chouhan"/><ref name="Cassels">Cassels (1983).</ref>

By 1984, only six of the original twelve operators were still working with MIC and the number of supervisory personnel was also halved. No maintenance supervisor was placed on the night shift and instrument readings were taken every two hours, rather than the previous and required one-hour readings.<ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name="Kurzman1987" /> Workers made complaints about the cuts through their union but were ignored. One employee was fired after going on a 15-day hunger strike. 70% of the plant's employees were fined before the disaster for refusing to deviate from the proper safety regulations under pressure from the management.<ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name="Kurzman1987" />

In addition, some observers, such as those writing in the Trade Environmental Database (TED) Case Studies as part of the Mandala Project from [[American University]], have pointed to "serious communication problems and management gaps between Union Carbide and its Indian operation", characterised by "the parent companies {{sic}} hands-off approach to its overseas operation" and "cross-cultural barriers".<ref name="TED">TED case 233 (1997).</ref>

===Equipment and safety regulations===
The MIC tank alarms had not been working for four years and there was only one manual back-up system, compared to a four-stage system used in the United States.<ref name=Eckerman2001/><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name=Lepowski /> The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with [[sodium hydroxide]] (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level.<ref name=Lepowski/> The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order at the time of the incident.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name=Weir>Weir (1987).</ref> To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name=Lepowski/> Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was inoperational for unknown reasons.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name="Lepowski" /> Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /> The water pressure was too weak to spray the escaping gases from the stack. They could not spray high enough to reduce the concentration of escaping gas.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name="Lepowski">Lepowski</ref> In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.<ref name="Kovel" />

According to the operators, the MIC tank pressure gauge had been malfunctioning for roughly a week. Other tanks were used, rather than repairing the gauge. The build-up in temperature and pressure is believed to have affected the magnitude of the gas release.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" /><ref name="Lepowski" /> UCC admitted in their own investigation report that most of the safety systems were not functioning on the night of 3 December 1984.<ref name="UCC1985" /> The design of the MIC plant, following government guidelines, was "Indianized" by UCIL engineers to maximise the use of indigenous materials and products. Mumbai-based Humphreys and Glasgow Consultants Pvt. Ltd., were the main consultants, [[Larsen & Toubro]] fabricated the MIC storage tanks, and Taylor of India Ltd. provided the instrumentation.<ref name=D>D'Silva, The Black Box of Bhopal (2006).</ref> In 1998, during civil action suits in India, it emerged that the plant was not prepared for problems. No action plans had been established to cope with incidents of this magnitude. This included not informing local authorities of the quantities or dangers of chemicals used and manufactured at Bhopal.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Kovel" /><ref name="Chouhan" />

==The leakage and its immediate effects==
===The release===
[[File:Preparation of carbaryl as in Bhopal.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|[[Methylamine]] ('''1''') reacts with [[phosgene]] ('''2''') producing [[methyl isocyanate]] ('''3''') which reacts with [[1-naphthol]] ('''4''') to yield [[carbaryl]] ('''5''')]]

The 1985 reports give a picture of what led to the disaster and how it developed, although they differ in details.<ref name="tradeunion" /><ref name="UCC1985">UCC Investigation Report (1985).</ref><ref name="Varadarajan">Varadarajan (1985).</ref>

In November 1984, most of the safety systems were not functioning and many valves and lines were in poor condition. In addition to this, several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service as well as the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes was nonoperational. Other issue was that, Tank 610 contained 42 tons of MIC which was much more than what safety rules allowed.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> During the night of 2–3 December 1984, water entered Tank E610 containing 42 tons of MIC. A [[Thermal runaway|runaway reaction]] started, which was accelerated by contaminants, high temperatures and other factors. The reaction was sped up by the presence of iron from corroding non-stainless steel pipelines.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The resulting [[exothermic reaction]] increased the temperature inside the tank to over {{convert|200|°C|°F}} and raised the pressure. This forced the emergency venting of pressure from the MIC holding tank, releasing a large volume of toxic gases. About 30 metric tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) escaped from the tank into the atmosphere in 45 to 60 minutes.<ref name="Varma 2005"/> 

====The gas cloud====
The gases were blown in southeastern direction over Bhopal.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bhopal Nightmare |episodelink= |series=Seconds from Disaster |serieslink=Seconds from Disaster |credits=Narrator: Ashton Smith |network=Nat Geo |date=10 October 2011 |season=4 |number=6 |minutes=5:45}}</ref>

As of 2008, UCC had not released information about the possible composition of the cloud. Apart from MIC, the gas cloud may have contained [[phosgene]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]], [[Methylamine|monomethyl amine]] (MMA) and [[carbon dioxide]], either produced in the storage tank or in the atmosphere.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The gas cloud was composed mainly of materials denser than the surrounding air, stayed close to the ground and spread outwards through the surrounding community.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

The nature of the cloud is still discussed. The chemical reactions would have produced a liquid or solid aerosol with high density. The concentrations at ground level would have been much higher than earlier published.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Bhopal atmospheric dispersion revisited |author=Havens J, Walker H, Spicer T
 |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=233–234 |pages=33–40 |date=30 September 2012}}</ref>

====Release theories====
Much speculation arose in the aftermath. The closing of the plant to outsiders (including UCC) by the [[Government of India|Indian government]] and the failure to make data public contributed to the confusion. The initial investigation was conducted entirely by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Central Bureau of Investigation. 

Theories differ as to how the water entered the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning out a clogged pipe with water about 400 feet from the tank. They claimed that they were not told to isolate the tank with a pipe slip-blind plate. The operators assumed that owing to bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into the tank..<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan">Chouhan ''et al.'' (2004).</ref> 

However, this water entry route could not be reproduced.<ref name="Weisman NYT Dec 1985 p.5">{{cite news|author=Steven R. Weisman|title=Bhopal a Year Later: An Eerie Silence|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=5 December 1985|page=5}}</ref> UCC maintains that this route was not possible, but instead alleges water was introduced directly into the tank as an act of sabotage by a disgruntled worker via a connection to a missing pressure gauge on the top of the tank. 

Early the next morning, a UCIL manager asked the instrument engineer to replace the gauge. UCIL's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection; however, the investigation was totally controlled by the government, denying UCC investigators access to the tank or interviews with the operators.<ref name="Kalelkar">Kalelkar (1988).</ref><ref name="tradeunion">Trade Union Report (1985).</ref>

UCC believed that a "disgruntled worker" deliberately connected a hose to a pressure gauge connection and was the real cause.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Kalelkar" />

===Acute effects===
[[File:Glutathione + Methylisocyanate Reaction.svg|thumb|Reversible reaction of [[glutathione]] (top) with [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC, middle) allows the MIC to be transported into the body]]

The initial effects of exposure were coughing, vomiting, severe eye irritation and a feeling of suffocation. People awakened by these symptoms fled away from the plant. Those who ran inhaled more than those who had a vehicle to ride. Owing to their height, children and other people of shorter stature inhaled higher concentrations. Many people were trampled trying to escape. 

Thousands of people had succumbed by the morning hours. There were mass funerals and mass cremations. Bodies were dumped into the Narmada River, less than 100&nbsp;km from Bhopal. 170,000 people were treated at hospitals and temporary dispensaries. 2,000 buffalo, goats, and other animals were collected and buried. Within a few days, leaves on trees yellowed and fell off. Supplies, including food, became scarce owing to suppliers' safety fears. Fishing  was prohibited causing further supply shortages.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> 

Within a few days, trees in the vicinity became barren, and 2,000 bloated animal carcasses had to be disposed of.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> On 16 December, tanks 611 and 619 were emptied of the remaining MIC. This led to a second mass evacuation from Bhopal.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The Government of India passed the "Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act" that gave the government rights to represent all victims, whether or not in India.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> Complaints of lack of information or misinformation were widespread. An Indian Government spokesman said, "Carbide is more interested in getting information from us than in helping our relief work."<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

Formal statements were issued that air, water, vegetation and foodstuffs were safe within the city. At the same time, people were informed that poultry was unaffected, but were warned not to consume fish.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> No one under the age of 18 was registered at the time of the accident. The number of children exposed to the gases was at least 200,000.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

The acute symptoms were burning in the respiratory tract and eyes, [[blepharospasm]], breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting. The causes of deaths were [[choking]], reflexogenic [[circulatory collapse]] and [[pulmonary oedema]]. Findings during [[autopsy|autopsies]] revealed changes not only in the lungs but also [[cerebral oedema]], [[tubular necrosis]] of the kidneys, [[Fatty liver|fatty degeneration of the liver]] and necrotising [[enteritis]].<ref name="Sriramachari">Sriramachari (2004).</ref> The [[stillbirth]] rate increased by up to 300% and [[Perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|neonatal mortality]] rate by around 200%.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

====Hydrogen cyanide debate====
Whether [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) was present in the gas mixture is still a controversy.<ref name="Sriramachari" /><ref name="GassertDhara">Gassert TH, Dhara VR, (2005).</ref> 

Cyanide concentrations of 300 ppm can lead to immediate collapse. The non-toxic antidote [[sodium thiosulfate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in intravenous injections increases the rate of conversion from cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate. 

Initial reports based on the autopsies of victims' bodies suggested cyanide poisoning based on which UCC's Dr. Bipan Avashia advised [[amyl nitrate]] and sodium thiosulphate.<ref name='ThePittsburghPress1985'>{{cite news | first = Shyam | last = Bhatia | title = Cyanide gas reported present in fatal chemical leak at Bhopal | date = 13 November 1985 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WBwhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JmMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6985,8167738&dq=bhopal+cyanide&hl=en | work = The Pittsburgh Press | accessdate = 2011-12-04}}</ref><ref name='ThePalmBeachPost1987'>{{cite news | title = Killing fog covered 25 miles; Assurances false: MIC worse than tear gas | date = 30 November 1987 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LyYuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D88FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3139,8927887&dq=bhopal+cyanide&hl=en | work = The Palm Beach Post | accessdate = 2011-12-04}}</ref> Treatment was tentatively used on some people, with mixed results.<ref name="ReferenceA">jean de maleissye, Histoire du poison, 1991.</ref><ref name="Eckerman2005" />

Critics argue that both the Government and Union Carbide tried to avoid mentioning the emotionally provocative word "cyanide."<ref name='ThePalmBeachPost1987'/>

Exposed to high temperatures, MIC breaks down to hydrogen cyanide (HCN). According to Kulling and Lorin, at +200&nbsp;°C, 3% of the gas is HCN.<ref name="Kulling">Kulling and Lorin (1987).</ref> However, according to another scientific publication,<ref>P.G. Blake and S. Ijadi-Maghsoodi, Kinetics and Mechanism of Thermal Decomposition of Methyl Isocyanate, ''International Journal of Chemical Kinetics'', vol.14, (1982), pp. 945–952.</ref> MIC when heated in the gas-phase starts to break down to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and other products above 400&nbsp;°C. 

Chemically, HCN is known to be very reactive with MIC.<ref>K.H. Slotta, R. Tschesche, ''Berichte'', vol.60, 1927, p.1031.</ref> HCN is also known to react with hydrochloric acid, ammonia, and methylamine (also produced in tank 610 during the vigorous reaction with water and chloroform) and also with itself under acidic conditions to form trimers of HCN called triazenes. 

Laboratory replication studies by CSIR and UCC scientists failed to detect any HCN or HCN-derived side products. None of the HCN-derived side products were detected in the tank residue.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grundmann | first1 = Christoph | last2 = Kreutzberger | first2 = Alfred | title = Triazines.

==Long term effects==
===Long term health effects===
All data about the health effects are still not available. The [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) was forbidden to publish health effect data until 1994.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

A total of 36 wards were marked by the authorities as being "gas affected", affecting a population of 520,000. Of these, 200,000 were below 15 years of age, and 3,000 were pregnant women.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The official immediate death toll was 2,259, and in 1991, 3,928 deaths had been officially certified. Others estimate 8,000 died within two weeks.<ref name="Eckerman2001" /><ref name="Eckerman2005" />

The [[government of Madhya Pradesh]] confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.<ref name="rehabilitation1"/>  

Later, the affected area was expanded to include 700,000 citizens. A government affidavit in 2006 stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.<ref name="first3" />

===Health care===
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the health care system became overloaded. Within weeks, the State Government established a number of hospitals, clinics and mobile units in the gas-affected area to treat the victims.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> Since the leak, large number of private practitioners were opened in Bhopal. In the severely affected areas, nearly 70 percent were underqualified doctors.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> Medical staff was unprepared for the thousands of casualties. Doctors and hospitals were not aware about proper treatment methods for MIC gas inhalation and they were directed to give cough medicine and eye drops to the patients.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

The Government of India had focused primarily on increasing the hospital-based services for gas victims thus hospitals had been built after the disaster.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> When UCC wanted to sell its shares in UCIL, it was directed by the Supreme Court to finance a 500-bed hospital for the medical care of the survivors. Thus, Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) was inaugurated in 1998 and was obliged to give free care for survivors for eight years.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />  BMHRC was a 350-bedded super speciality hospital were heart surgery and hemodialysis were done however, there was dearth of gynaecology, obstetrics and paediatrics. Eight mini-units (outreach health centres) were started and free health care for gas victims were to be offered till 2006.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The management had also faced problems with strikes, and the quality of the health care being disputed.<ref name=BMHT2005>{{cite web|title=Bhopal Memorial Hospital closed indefinitely|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/04/stories/2005070401510500.htm|publisher=The Hindu|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Time line|url=http://www.bhopal.net/delhi-marchers/factsheets/BMHT%20sheet.pdf|publisher=Bhopal Memorial Hospital Trust|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> [[Sambhavna Trust]] is a charitable trust, registered in 1995, that gives [[modern medicine|modern]] as well as [[ayurvedic]] treatments to gas victims, free of charge.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="sambhavna">{{cite web |publisher=Sambhavna Trust |title=The Bhopal Medical appeal |url=http://www.bhopal.org}}</ref>

===Environmental rehabilitation===
When the factory was closed in 1986, pipes, drums and tanks were sold. The MIC and the Sevin plants are still there, as are storages of different residues. Isolation material is falling down and spreading.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The area around the plant was used as a dumping area for hazardous chemicals.

==Union Carbide's defence==
Now owned by [[Dow Chemical Company]], Union Carbide denied the allegations against it on its website dedicated to the tragedy. The corporation claimed that the incident was the result of sabotage, stating that safety systems were in place and operative. It also stressed that it did all it could to alleviate human suffering following the disaster.<ref name="ucs">{{cite web |title=Statement of Union Carbide Corporation Regarding the Bhopal Tragedy |url=http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |publisher=Bhopal Information Center|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

===Investigation into possible sabotage===
Theories differ as to how the water entered the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning out pipes with water. The workers maintain that entry of water through the plant's piping system during the washing of lines was possible because a slip-blind was not used, the downstream bleeder lines were partially clogged, many valves were leaking, and the tank was not pressurised. The water, which was not draining properly through the bleeder valves, may have built up in the pipe, rising high enough to pour back down through another series of lines in the MIC storage tank. Once water had accumulated to a height of 6 metres (20&nbsp;feet), it could drain by gravity flow back into the system. Alternatively, the water may have been routed through another standby "jumper line" that had only recently been connected to the system. Indian scientists suggested that additional water might have been introduced as a "back-flow" from the defectively designed vent-gas scrubber. However, none of these postulated routes of entry could be duplicated when tested by the Central Bureau of Investigators (CBI) and UCIL engineers.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /><ref name="Chouhan" />

Union Carbide cited an investigation conducted by the engineering consulting firm [[Arthur D. Little]], which concluded that a single employee secretly and deliberately introduced a large amount of water into the MIC tank by removing a meter and connecting a water hose directly to the tank through the metering port.<ref name="Kalelkar" /> Carbide claimed that such a large amount of water could not have found its way into the tank by accident, and safety systems were not designed to deal with intentional sabotage. Documents cited in the Arthur D. Little report stated that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) along with UCIL engineers tried to simulate the water-washing hypothesis as a route of the entry of water into the tank. This test failed to support this as a route of the water entry. UCC claims the plant staff falsified numerous records to distance themselves from the incident, and that the Indian Government impeded its investigation and declined to prosecute the employee responsible, presumably because that would weaken its allegations of negligence by Union Carbide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |month=November |year=2009 |work=Bhopal Information Center |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |accessdate=4 April 2010 |quote=The Indian authorities are well aware of the identity of the employee [who sabotaged the plant] and the nature of the evidence against him.

===Safety and equipment issues===
The corporation denied the claim that the valves on the tank were malfunctioning, and claimed that the documented evidence gathered after the incident showed that the valve close to the plant's water-washing operation was closed and was leak-tight. Furthermore, process safety systems had prevented water from entering the tank by accident. Carbide states that the safety concerns identified in 1982 were all allayed before 1984 and had nothing to do with the incident.<ref name="faq">{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Frequently Asked Questions}}</ref>

The company admitted that the safety systems in place would not have been able to prevent a chemical reaction of that magnitude from causing a leak. According to Carbide, "in designing the plant's safety systems, a chemical reaction of this magnitude was not factored in" because "the tank's gas storage system was designed to automatically prevent such a large amount of water from being inadvertently introduced into the system" and "process safety systems—in place and operational—would have prevented water from entering the tank by accident". Instead, they claim that "employee sabotage—not faulty design or operation—was the cause of the tragedy".<ref name="faq" />

===Response===
The company stressed the "immediate action" taken after the disaster and their continued commitment to helping the victims. On 4 December, the day following the leak, Union Carbide sent material aid and several international medical experts to assist the medical facilities in Bhopal.<ref name="faq" /> Union Carbide states on its website that it put $2 million into the Indian prime minister's immediate disaster relief fund on 11 December 1984.<ref name="faq" /> The corporation established the Employees' Bhopal Relief Fund in February 1985, which raised more than {{Nowrap|$5 million}} for immediate relief.<ref name="chrono">{{cite web |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Chronology|accessdate=2012-08-30 |url=http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm}}</ref> According to Union Carbide, in August 1987, they made an additional {{Nowrap|$4.6 million}} in humanitarian interim relief available.<ref name="chrono" />

Union Carbide stated that it also undertook several steps to provide continuing aid to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. The sale of its 50.9 percent interest in UCIL in April 1992 and establishment of a charitable trust to contribute to the building of a local hospital. The sale was finalised in November 1994. The hospital was begun in October 1995 and was opened in 2001. The company provided a fund with around {{Nowrap|$90 million}} from sale of its UCIL stock. In 1991, the trust had amounted approximately {{Nowrap|$100 million}}. The hospital catered for the treatment of heart, lung and eye problems.<ref name="ucs" /> UCC also provided a $2.2 million grant to Arizona State University to establish a vocational-technical center in Bhopal, which was opened, but was later closed by the state government.<ref name="irs">{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/irs.htm |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Incident Response and Settlement|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> They also donated $5 million to the [[Indian Red Cross]] after the disaster.<ref name="irs" /> They also developed a [[Responsible Care]] system with other members of the chemical industry as a response to the Bhopal crisis, which was designed to help prevent such an event in the future.<ref name="chrono" />

==Legal action against Union Carbide==
[[File:BHOPAL (231583728).jpg|thumb|Victims of Bhopal disaster asked for Warren Anderson's extradition from the USA|alt=Number of women pictured in black and white colour, sitting and protesting against Anderson and the company.]]
Legal proceedings involving UCC, the United States and Indian governments, local Bhopal authorities, and the disaster victims started immediately after the catastrophe. Legal action against UCC dominated the aftermath of the disaster.  Other issues have continued to develop including the problems of ongoing contamination and associated criticism of the clean-up operation undertaken by UCIL.

===Legal proceedings leading to the settlement===
On 14 December 1984, the chairman and CEO of UCC, [[Warren Anderson (chairman)|Warren Anderson]], addressed the US Congress, stressing the company's "commitment to safety" and promising to ensure that a similar incident "cannot happen again". The Indian Government passed the Bhopal Gas Leak Act in March 1985, allowing the Government of India to act as the legal representative for victims of the disaster,<ref name="chrono" /> leading to the beginning of legal proceedings. In 1985, [[Henry Waxman]], a California Democrat, called for a US government inquiry into the Bhopal disaster, which resulted in US legislation regarding the accidental release of toxic chemicals in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=BP, Bhopal and the humble Indian brinjal|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/BP-Bhopal-and-the-humble-Indian-brinjal/Article1-561254.aspx|accessdate=26 June 2010|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=22 June 2010|author=Dipankar De Sarkar}}</ref> In March 1986 UCC proposed a settlement figure, endorsed by plaintiffs' US attorneys, of {{Nowrap|$350 million}} that would, according to the company, "generate a fund for Bhopal victims of between {{Nowrap|$500–600 million}} over 20 years". In May, litigation was transferred from the US to Indian courts by US District Court Judge. Following an appeal of this decision, the US Court of Appeals affirmed the transfer, judging, in January 1987, that UCIL was a "separate entity, owned, managed and operated exclusively by Indian citizens in India".<ref name="chrono" />

The Government of India refused the offer from Union Carbide and claimed US$ {{Nowrap|3.3 billion}}.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The [[Supreme Court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] told both sides to come to an agreement and "start with a clean slate" in November 1988.<ref name="chrono" /> Eventually, in an out-of-court settlement reached in February 1989, Union Carbide agreed to pay US$ {{Nowrap|470 million}} for damages caused in the Bhopal disaster, 15% of the original {{Nowrap|$3 billion}} claimed in the lawsuit.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> 

Throughout 1990, the Indian Supreme Court heard appeals against the settlement from "activist petitions". In October 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the original {{Nowrap|$470 million}}, dismissing any other outstanding petitions that challenged the original decision. The Court ordered the Indian government "to purchase, out of settlement fund, a group medical insurance policy to cover 100,000 persons who may later develop symptoms" and cover any shortfall in the settlement fund. It also requested UCC and its subsidiary UCIL "voluntarily" fund a hospital in Bhopal, at an estimated {{Nowrap|$17 million}}, to specifically treat victims of the Bhopal disaster. The company agreed to this.<ref name="chrono" />

===Charges against UCC and UCIL employees===
UCC chairman, CEO Warren Anderson was arrested and released on bail by the Madhya Pradesh Police in Bhopal on 7 December 1984. The arrest, which took place at the airport, ensured Anderson would meet no harm by the Bhopal community. Anderson was taken to UCC's house after which he was released six hours later on $2,100 bail and flown out on a government plane. These actions were allegedly taken under the direction of then chief secretary of the state, who was possibly instructed from chief minister's office, who himself flew out of Bhopal immediately.<ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebhopalpost.com/index.php/2012/07/when-the-gas-leaked-arjun-flew-away-to-pray/|title=When the gas leaked, Arjun flew away to pray|publisher=The Bhopal Post| date=7 July 2012|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120704/jsp/nation/story_15688988.jsp#.UBj6JmHaabs |title=When the gas leaked, Arjun flew away to pray|publisher=The Telegraph|date=3 July 2012|first=Rasheed |last=Kidwai|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 3">{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-10/india/28318396_1_warren-anderson-state-plane-chief-secretary|first=Suchandana|last=Gupta|title=Chief secretary told me to let Anderson go: Ex- Collector|publisher=The Times of India|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Later in 1987, the [[Indian government]] summoned Anderson, eight other executives and two company affiliates with [[homicide]] charges to appear in Indian court.<ref name="nytimes88">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D71F3CF934A25756C0A96E948260|title=India Acts in Carbide Case|publisher=The New York Times|date=17 May 1988|accessdate=2012-08-30|author=Reuters}}</ref> In response, Union Carbide balked, saying the company is not under Indian jurisdiction.<ref name="nytimes88" />

In 1991, the local Bhopal authorities charged Anderson, who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on 1 February 1992 for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable [[homicide]] case in which he was named the chief defendant. Orders were passed to the Government of India to press for an [[extradition]] from the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear an appeal of the decision of the lower federal courts in October 1993, meaning that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a US court.<ref name="chrono" />

In 2004, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Indian government to release any remaining settlement funds to victims. And in September 2006, the Welfare Commission for Bhopal Gas Victims announced that all original compensation claims and revised petitions had been "cleared".<ref name="chrono" /> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in New York City upheld the dismissal of remaining claims in the case of ''Bano v. Union Carbide Corporation'' in 2006. This move blocked plaintiffs' motions for class certification and claims for property damages and remediation. In the view of UCC, "the ruling reaffirms UCC's long-held positions and finally puts to rest—both procedurally and substantively—the issues raised in the class action complaint first filed against Union Carbide in 1999 by Haseena Bi and several organisations representing the residents of Bhopal".<ref name="chrono" />

In June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by [[negligence]] and each sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined [[Indian rupee|Rs.]]1 [[lakh]] (US$2,124). All were released on bail shortly after the verdict. The names of those convicted are: Keshub Mahindra, former non-executive chairman of Union Carbide India Limited; V.P. Gokhale, managing director; Kishore Kamdar, vice-president; J. Mukund, works manager; S.P. Chowdhury, production manager; K.V. Shetty, plant superintendent; and S.I. Qureshi, production assistant.

Federal class action litigation, Sahu v. Union Carbide and Warren Anderson, sought damages for personal injury, medical monitoring and injunctive relief in the form of clean-up of the drinking water supplies for residential areas near the Bhopal plant. The lawsuit was dismissed and subsequent appeal denied.<ref>http://www.earthrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/District-Court-June-2012-dismissal-of-Sahu-I.pdf</ref>

==Activism==
Since 1984, individual activists have played a role in the aftermath of the tragedy. The most welknown is [[Satinath Sarangi]] (Sathyu), a metallurgic engineer who arrived at Bhopal the day after the leakage. He founded several activist groups, as well as [[Sambhavna Trust]], the clinic for gas affected patients, where he is the manager.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />  Other activists are Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, who received the [[Goldman Prize]] in 2004, and Abdul Jabbar.<ref>http://www.goldmanprize.org/2004/Asia</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anindianmuslim.com/2009/12/crusader-for-victims-truth-of-bhopal.html |title=An Indian Muslim's Blog: News, Views & Urdu Poetry Website: Crusader for Victims: The Truth of Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its Aftermath-Part III |publisher=Anindianmuslim.com |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> 

===Local activism===
Soon after the accident, representatives from different activist groups arrived. The activists worked on organising the gas victims, which led to violent repression from the police and the government.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> 

Numerous actions have been performed: demonstrations, sit-ins, hungerstrikes, marches combined with pamphlets, books, and articles. Every anniversary, actions are performed. Often these include marches around Old Bhopal, ending with burning an effigy of [[Warren Anderson (chairman)|Warren Anderson]].

===International activism===
Cooperation with international NGOs including [http://www.pan-uk.org/ Pesticide Action Network UK] and [http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/toxics/justice-for-bhopal/ Greenpeace] started soon after the tragedy. One of the earliest reports is the Trade Union report from ILO 1985.<ref name=tradeunion1985>[http://www.bhopal.net/oldsite/documentlibrary/unionreport1985.html The Trade Union Report on Bhopal], Geneva, Switzerland: ICFTU-ICEF, 1985</ref>

In 1994, the [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]] (IMCB) met in Bhopal. Their work contributed to long term health effects being officially recognised.  

Important international actions have been the tour to Europe and USA in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|author=Media release – 23 April 2004 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/bhopal-victims-warn-u-s-gover/ |title=Bhopal Victims Warn U.S. Government and Dow Chemical of Impending Catastrophe |publisher=Greenpeace |date=23 April 2004 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>  the marches to Delhi in 2006 and 2008, all including hungerstrikes, and the Bhopal Europe Bus Tour in 2009.

Bhopal is one of the knots in an international NGO network, working against corporations' violations of environment and human rights.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

===Activist organisations===
At least 14 different NGOs were immediately engaged.<ref name="Eckerman2005" /> The first disaster reports were published by activist organisations, [[Eklavya]] and the [[Delhi Science Forum]]. 

Around ten local organisations, engaged on long term, have been identified. Two of the most active organisations are the women's organisations Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila-Stationery Karmachari Sangh and Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangthan.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

More than 15 national organisations have been engaged along with a number of international organisations.<ref name="Eckerman2005" />

Some of the most important organisations are:
*[http://bhopal.net/ International Campaign For Justice in Bhopal] (ICJB) Coordinating international activities.
*[http://www.bhopal.org/ Bhopal Medical Appeal] Collects funds for the Sambhavna Trust.
*[[Sambhavna Trust]] or Bhopal People's Health and Documentation Clinic. Provides medical care for gas affected patients and those living in water contaminated area.
*[http://www.chingaritrustbhopal.com/ Chingari Trust] Provides medical care for children being born in Bhopal with malformations and brain damages.
*[http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/ Students for Bhopal] Based in USA.
*[[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]] Provided medical information 1994–2000.

===Settlement fund hoax===
[[Image:Dow apologizes.jpg|right|thumb|Bichlbaum as Finisterra on BBC World News]]

On 3 December 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the disaster, a man claiming to be a Dow representative named Jude Finisterra was interviewed on [[BBC World News]]. He claimed that the company had agreed to clean up the site and compensate those harmed in the incident, by liquidating Union Carbide for {{Nowrap|US$12 billion}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dow Does The Right Thing|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bbcbhopal|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dow|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Immediately afterward, Dow's share price fell 4.2% in 23 minutes, for a loss of {{Nowrap|$2 billion}} in market value. Dow quickly issued a statement saying that they had no employee by that name—that he was an impostor, not affiliated with Dow, and that his claims were a hoax. The BBC later broadcast a correction and an apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=66&ItemID=6795 |title=Corporate Responsibility. 5 December 2004. Published by [[ZNet]] |publisher=Zmag.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

Jude Finisterra was actually [[Jacque Servin|Andy Bichlbaum]], a member of the activist prankster group [[The Yes Men]]. In 2002, The Yes Men issued a fake press release explaining why Dow refused to take responsibility for the disaster and started up a website, at "DowEthics.com", designed to look like the real Dow website, but with what they felt was a more accurate cast on the events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow/ |title=The Yes Men |publisher=The Yes Men |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>

===Monitoring of Bhopal activists===
A [[2012 Stratfor email leak|release of an email cache]] related to intelligence research organisation [[Stratfor]] was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] on 27 February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/date/2011.html |title=Wikileaks GI release 2011 |publisher=Wikileaks |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> It revealed that Dow Chemical had engaged Stratfor to spy on the public and personal lives of activists involved in the Bhopal disaster, including the Yes Men. Regular, even daily emails to Dow representatives from hired security analysts list the YouTube videos liked, Twitter and Facebook posts made and the public appearances of these activists, including the Yes Men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/407784_dow-confidential-bhopal-monitoring-report-friday-november-18.html |title=An example email report |publisher=Wikileaks |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Stratfor released a statement condemning the revelation by Wikileaks while neither confirming nor denying the accuracy of the reports, and would only state that it had acted within the bounds of the law. Dow Chemical also refrained to comment on the matter.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=WSJ India Real Time |title=WikiLeaks: Dow Monitored Bhopal Activists |date=29 February 2012 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/02/29/wikileaks-dow-monitored-bhopal-activists/|accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>
