'''Temporal lobe epilepsy''' is a form of [[Focal seizures|focal]] [[epilepsy]], a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[neurology|neurological]] condition characterized by recurrent [[seizure]]s. Over 40 types of epilepsies are known.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.152a8-1157.2001.10401.x |author=Engel J |author2=International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) |title=A proposed diagnostic scheme for people with epileptic seizures and with epilepsy: report of the ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology |journal=Epilepsia |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=796–803 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11422340 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0013-9580&date=2001&volume=42&issue=6&spage=796}}</ref> They fall into two main categories: [[partial-onset]] (focal or localization-related) epilepsies and [[generalized-onset]] epilepsies.

Temporal lobe epilepsies are a group of medical disorders in which humans and animals experience recurrent epileptic seizures arising from one or both [[temporal lobe]]s of the brain. Two main types are internationally recognized according to the International League Against Epilepsy.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
* '''Medial<!--This is not a misspelling. All of the literature uses "mesial."--> temporal lobe epilepsy :(MTLE)''' arises in the [[hippocampus]], [[parahippocampal gyrus]] and [[amygdala]] which are located in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe.
* '''Lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE)''' arises in the [[neocortex]] on the outer surface of the temporal lobe of the brain.

Because of strong interconnections, seizures beginning in either the medial or lateral temporal areas often spread to involve both areas and also to neighboring areas on the same side of the brain as well as the temporal lobe on the opposite side of the brain. Temporal lobe seizures can also spread to the adjacent frontal lobe and to the parietal and occipital lobes. The causes or [[etiology]] of different temporal lobe epilepsies vary and are discussed below.

==Syndrome of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)==
The classical syndrome of TLE may begin when there is a very early injury to the left or right [[hippocampus]] that causes neuron death. Infants may develop heart,lung or skin infections resulting in a fever. Babies have an immature thermoregulation system, and the fever causes the baby's core body temperature to increase more drastically than in adults.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In some children, elevated body temperature can cause [[febrile seizures]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Febrile seizures]] are relatively normal as they occur in 2-5% of children under age 5 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} They typically last only a few minutes or even a matter of seconds, but are neither severe motor convulsions nor followed by weakness on one side of the body. In a small number of babies, these convulsions can last for over an hour and involve repeated convulsive episodes. These are known as complex febrile seizures and may be causatively associated with TLE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} As discussed below in the section on causes, it remains controversial whether complex febrile seizures actually cause TLE,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} or whether they are simply the earliest manifestation of the TLE condition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Causes==
A link between [[febrile seizure]]s (seizures coinciding with episodes of fever in young children) and subsequent temporal lobe epilepsy has been suggested, but the exact role remains unclear.<ref name="FEBSTAT">{{cite journal |author=Shinnar S, Hesdorffer DC, Nordli DR, ''et al.'' |title=Phenomenology of prolonged febrile seizures: results of the FEBSTAT study |journal=Neurology |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=170–6 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18525033 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000310774.01185.97 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18525033}}</ref><ref name="pmid12552033">{{cite journal |author=Tarkka R, Pääkkö E, Pyhtinen J, Uhari M, Rantala H |title=Febrile seizures and mesial temporal sclerosis: No association in a long-term follow-up study |journal=Neurology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=215–8 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12552033 |doi= |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12552033}}</ref><ref name="pmid17897728">{{cite journal |author=Dubé CM, Brewster AL, Richichi C, Zha Q, Baram TZ |title=Fever, febrile seizures and epilepsy |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=490–6 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17897728 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.07.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-2236(07)00209-3 |pmc=2766556}}</ref><ref name="pmid10563622">{{cite journal |author=Berg AT, Shinnar S, Levy SR, Testa FM |title=Childhood-onset epilepsy with and without preceding febrile seizures |journal=Neurology |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1742–8 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10563622 |doi= |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10563622}}</ref><ref name="pmid11402099">{{cite journal |author=Berg AT, Shinnar S, Levy SR, Testa FM, Smith-Rapaport S, Beckerman B |title=Early development of intractable epilepsy in children: a prospective study |journal=Neurology |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=1445–52 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11402099 |doi= |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11402099}}</ref>

Interestingly, some cases of MTLE present without the typical changes of [[mesial temporal sclerosis]] or other abnormalities on MRI scans. This has been termed paradoxical mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

Although this theory needs confirmation, some studies have pointed to [[human herpesvirus 6]] (HHV-6) as a possible link between febrile convulsions and later MTLE.

Rarely, MTLE can be hereditary or related to [[brain tumor]]s, spinal meningitis, encephalitis, head injury or blood vessel malformations. MTLE can occur in association with other brain malformations. Most often, a cause cannot be determined with certainty.

LTLE is less common. It can be hereditary, as in [[Autosomal dominant|Autosomal Dominant]] Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (ADLTLE) with auditory or visual features, but can also be associated with tumors, meningitis, encephalitis, trauma, vascular malformations or congenital brain malformations. Again, in many affected persons it is common that no cause can be identified.

Dispersion of granule cell layer in the hippocampal [[dentate gyrus]] is occasionally seen in temporal lobe epilepsy and has been linked to the downregulation of [[reelin]],<!--

--> a protein that normally keeps the layer compact by containing the [[neuronal migration]]. It is unknown whether changes in reelin expression play a role in epilepsy.

==Symptoms==
The symptoms felt by the person, and the signs observable by others, during seizures which begin in the temporal lobe depend upon the specific regions of the temporal lobe and neighboring brain areas affected by the seizure. The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures published in 1981 by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) recognizes three types of seizures which persons with TLE may experience.<ref>Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy. Proposal for revised clinical and electroencephalographic classification of epileptic seizures. ''Epilepsia'' 1981;22:489-501.</ref>
# [[Simple partial seizure|Simple Partial Seizures]] (SPS) involve small areas of the temporal lobe such as the amygdala or the hippocampus. The term "simple" means that consciousness is not altered. In temporal lobe epilepsy SPS usually only cause sensations. These sensations may be [[mnestic]] such as [[déjà vu]] (a feeling of familiarity), [[jamais vu]] (a feeling of unfamiliarity), a specific single or set of memories, or [[amnesia]]. The sensations may be auditory such as a sound or tune, gustatory such as a taste, or olfactory such as a smell that is not physically present. Sensations can also be visual, involve feelings on the skin or in the internal organs. The latter feelings may seem to move over the body. Dysphoric or euphoric feelings, fear, anger, and other sensations can also occur during SPS. Often, it is hard for persons with SPS of TLE to describe the feeling. SPS are often called "auras" by lay persons who mistake them for a warning sign of a subsequent seizure. In fact, they are actual seizures in and of themselves. Persons experiencing only SPS may not recognize what they are or seek medical advice about them. SPS may or may not progress to the seizure types listed below.
# [[Complex partial seizure|Complex Partial Seizures]] (CPS) by definition are seizures which impair consciousness to some extent. This is to say that they alter the person's ability to interact with his or her environment. They usually begin with an SPS, but then the seizure spreads to a larger portion of the temporal lobe resulting in impaired consciousness. Signs may include motionless staring, automatic movements of the hands or mouth, altered ability to respond to others, unusual speech, or unusual behaviors.
# Seizures which begin in the temporal lobe but then spread to the whole brain are known as [[Secondarily Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures]] (SGTCS). These begin with an SPS or CPS phase initially, but then the arms, trunk and legs stiffen (tonic) in either a flexed or extended position and then clonic jerking of the limbs often occurs. GTCS are often known in the vernacular as convulsions or "grand mal" (originally a French term) seizures.

Following each of these seizures, there is some period of recovery in which neurological function is altered. This is called the [[postictal state]]. The degree and length of the impairment directly correlates with the severity of the 3 seizure types listed above. SPS often last less than 60 seconds, CPS often last less than 2 minutes, and SGTCS usually last less than 3 minutes. The postictal state in the case of CPS and GTCS often lasts much longer than the seizure [[ictus]] itself. Because a major function of the temporal lobe is short-term memory, CPS and GTCS cause amnesia for the seizure. As a result, many persons with temporal lobe CPS and GTCS will not remember having had a seizure.

Local and national laws exist regarding the operation of vehicles, aircraft and vessels by patients with epilepsy. Most licensing departments do not allow driving of vehicles by persons with CPS or GTCS until they have been seizure-free for a specified period of time. The laws are complex and varied; affected persons must check with the appropriate licensing authority. In a few locations, health care providers are legally-required to report patients with epilepsy (and other medical conditions which cause episodes of altered consciousness) to their local department of motor vehicles.<ref>Sample New Jersey, USA, medical report form: http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/pdf/Violations/MVC-Form_MR-4.pdf</ref>

==Treatments==
There are many oral [[medication]]s available for the management of epileptic seizures. They were previously called [[anticonvulsants]] however this term is misleading because most seizures are not convulsions. The modern term is [[antiepileptic drugs]] (AEDs). In TLE, the most commonly used older AEDs are [[phenytoin]], [[carbamazepine]], [[primidone]], [[valproate]] and [[phenobarbital]]. Newer drugs, such as [[gabapentin]], [[topiramate]], [[levetiracetam]], [[lamotrigine]], [[pregabalin]], [[tiagabine]], [[lacosamide]], and [[zonisamide]] promise similar effectiveness, possibly with fewer [[adverse effect|side-effects]]. [[Felbamate]] and [[vigabatrin]] are newer AEDs, but can have serious [[adverse effects]] so they are not considered first-line AEDs. Nearly all AEDs function by decreasing the excitation of [[neurons]] (e.g., by blocking fast or slow [[sodium channels]] or modulating [[calcium channels]]) or by enhancing the inhibition of neurons (e.g., by potentiating the effects of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]]). Unfortunately, many patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (up to one-third) will not experience adequate seizure control with medication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kwan P, Brodie MJ |title=Early identification of refractory epilepsy |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=342 |issue=5 |pages=314–9 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10660394 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200002033420503}}</ref>

For patients with medial TLE whose seizures remain uncontrolled after trials of several AEDs (intractable), resective [[surgery]] should be considered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Engel J |title=Surgery for seizures |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=334 |issue=10 |pages=647–52 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8592530 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199603073341008 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM199603073341008?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref> Epilepsy surgery has been performed since the 1860s and physicians and surgeons had observed for decades that it was highly effective in producing seizure freedom. However, it was not until 2001 that a scientifically sound study was performed on the effectiveness of temporal lobectomy.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200108023450501 | author = Wiebe S ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = A randomized, controlled trial of surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 345 | issue = 5| pages = 311–8 | pmid = 11484687 }}</ref>  This study proved that after the failure of several AEDs to control seizures in TLE temporal lobe surgery is far more effective in producing seizure freedom than is additional medication trials. The unanswered question that remains is how many medications a person must fail before considering surgery. A United States sponsored research study called ERSET was begun to answer the question of whether surgery can successfully be performed early in the course of TLE. The primary outcome variable was freedom from disabling seizures during year 2 of follow-up. The study ended earlier than anticipated with a total enrollment of 38 patients.  Of these, 23 were enrolled in the anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment arm, whereas 15 received both AED treatment and surgery for TLE.  The results showed that none of the patients who only received AED achieved the study endpoint; that is, none were free of disabling seizures during year 2 of follow-up.  In contrast, 11 of the 15 who both received AED and surgery for TLE were free of disabling seizures (odds ratio = ∞; 95% CI, 11.8 to ∞; P < .001).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.220 | author = Engle J ''et al.'' | year = 2012 | title = Early surgical therapy for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy: a randomized trial | journal = J Am Med Assoc |volume = 307 | issue = 9 | pages = 322-30 | pmid = 22396514}}</ref>

In preparation for these surgeries, patients are monitored by various methods to determine the focus of their seizures (that is, the region of the brain where seizures tend to arise before spreading). This can be done with [[video-EEG monitoring]], intracranial [[EEG]] (where electrodes are placed beneath the skull, either within or resting just outside the brain), or [[SPECT]] imaging. [[MRI]] studies may additionally be used to seek evidence of hippocampal sclerosis. Once the epileptic focus has been determined, it can be excised, which usually involves removing part of the [[hippocampus]] and often the [[amygdala]]. To avoid removing areas of the brain responsible for speech (so-called "eloquent" areas), the surgical team will conduct a [[Wada test]] pre-operatively, wherein [[amobarbital]] is injected in the left or right [[carotid artery]] to temporarily quiet one half of the brain. If the patient performs poorly on neuropsychological testing during the intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) test, the surgical team may advise the patient against surgery or may offer a more limited operation.

If a person is not an optimal candidate for epilepsy surgery, then AEDs not previously tried, the [[vagus nerve stimulator]], or AEDs in clinical research trials might be alternative treatments. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}For children, the [[ketogenic diet]] may also be tried. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}Other possible future therapies such as brain cortex responsive neural stimulators, [[deep brain stimulation]], and stereotactic radiosurgery (such as [[gamma knife]]) are undergoing research studies for treatment of TLE and other forms of epilepsy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Social and artistic influence==
===Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and the Arts===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
As Eve LaPlante discusses in her book, ''Seized'', the intense emotions, sensory experience including vibrancy of colors, and particular mental state provoked by temporal lobe abnormalities may have contributed to the creation of significant works of art. A number of well-known writers and artists are known, or in many cases suspected to have had temporal lobe epilepsy, aggravated, in some cases, by [[alcoholism]]. They include [[Vincent Van Gogh]], Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. [[Lewis Carroll]]), [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] (whose novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' features a protagonist with epilepsy, Prince Myshkin), [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Sylvia Plath]] and contemporary [[author]] [[Thom Jones]]. Peter O'Leary has also discussed this in relation to work of poet Philip Jenks in his "Gnostic Contagion: Robert Duncan and the Poetry of Illness". [[Sadi Ranson|Sadi Ranson-Polizzotti]] has discussed the significance of Lewis Carroll's epilepsy [http://tantmieux.squarespace.com/lewis-carroll/ online] and in a forthcoming book on the subject.

===Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Neurotheology and Paranormal Experience===
The first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with TLE was neurologist [[Norman Geschwind]], who noted a constellation of symptoms, including [[hypergraphia]], hyperreligiosity, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting spells]], and [[pedantic|pedantism]], often collectively ascribed to a condition known as [[Geschwind syndrome]].

[[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using [[galvanic skin response]] (which correlates with emotional arousal) to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998). By presenting subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR, Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. These results suggest that the medial temporal lobe is specifically involved in generating some of the emotional reactions associated with religious words, images and symbols.

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] researcher [[Michael Persinger]] asserts that stimulating the temporal lobe [[electromagnetism|electromagnetically]] can cause TLE and trigger [[hallucination]]s of apparent [[paranormal phenomena]] such as [[ghost]]s and [[UFO]]s. Persinger has even created a "[[God helmet]]" which purportedly can evoke [[altered states of consciousness]] through stimulation of the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and temporal lobes. [[Neurotheology|Neurotheologians]] speculate that individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, having a natural tendency to experience states of consciousness such as [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] or ''[[samādhi]]'', have functioned in human history as religious figures or [[shaman]]s.

Sex hormones can influence the timing and frequency of seizure activity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Estrogen]] is pro-epileptic and [[progesterone]] is anti-epileptic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} These counterbalancing effects may account for "[[catamenial epilepsy]]" i.e. epilepsy preceding or made more severe prior to [[menstruation]] or during [[peri-ovulation]]. Gender may differentially influence neocortical pathologies in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doherty MJ, Rostad SW, Kraemer DL, Vossler DG, Haltiner AM |title=Neocortical gliosis in temporal lobe epilepsy: gender-based differences |journal=Epilepsia |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=1455–9 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17430405 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01046.x}}</ref>
==Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Personality and Depression==

===Personality===

The effect of temporal lobe epilepsy on personality is a historical observation dating back to the 1800’s. Historical psychologists such as Sigmund Freud stated, “We know that epilepsy produces these remarkable changes in the personality."[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=9&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2009-12026-006] Personality change in temporal lobe epilepsy is seen as a chronic syndrome. It is classified as a chronic syndrome when symptoms from a particular disorder persist for a minimum of 3 months. Personality and behavioral changes can be a result of the seizures from temporal lobe epilepsy. Norman Geschwind [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=9&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2009-12026-006] suggested that a reason for this personality change could be the location in the brain where the syndrome takes place. Geschwind article stated, “It’s the location of the lesions producing temporal lobe epilepsy. These lesions are characteristically on the surface of the temporal lobe.[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=9&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2009-12026-006]” Furthermore, “These lesions lie directly in structures with pathways into the parts of the brain that are involved in emotional behavior."[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=9&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2009-12026-006]”Emotional behavior in this regards can be seen as actions that contributes to an individual’s personality who has temporal lobe epilepsy.  <br />

===Depression===

	Individuals suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy have a high prevalence of depression[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=15&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2011-29111-001]. Depressive symptoms have been estimated up to 20-55%[http://www.psychinfo.com] in individuals that have temporal lobe epilepsy. Depressive symptoms undoubtedly take a toll on individual’s lives that are not diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Individuals who have temporal epilepsy and depression are suggested to experience from a quality of life decrease[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=13&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2011-25352-010]. This decrease in quality of life has lead researchers to findings of suicidal thoughts in these individuals[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=11&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2011-28383-018]. Research on this topic has been conducted for decades. One study suggests the connection between temporal lobe epilepsy and depression is the pathogenic mechanism underlying in depression[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=17&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2012-04815-031]. That epilepsy and psychiatric disorders could possibly share common pathogenic pathways[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=17&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2012-04815-031]. These pathways may influence the correlation among the two.  Whether or not the depressive symptoms start prior or after the epileptic attacks are still unclear[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=111&sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2010-16843-005], but the presence of a correlation is very evident. <br />
