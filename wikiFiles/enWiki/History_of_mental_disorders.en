===Egyptian and Mesopotamian===
Limited notes in an [[ancient Egypt]]ian document known as the [[Ebers papyrus]] appear to describe disordered states of [[concentration]] and [[attention]], and emotional distress in the heart or mind.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained A Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref>  Some of these have been interpreted as indicating what would later be termed [[hysteria]] and [[melancholy]]. Somatic treatments typically included applying bodily fluids while reciting [[magic (paranormal)|magical spells]]. [[Hallucinogens]] may have been used as part of healing rituals. Religious temples may have been used as therapeutic [[retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], possibly for the induction of receptive states to facilitate sleep and the interpreting of [[dream]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Nasser | first1=M. | title=Psychiatry in Ancient Egypt | url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/11/12/420.pdf | journal=Psychiatric Bulletin | volume=11 | pages=420 | year=1987 | doi = 10.1192/pb.11.12.420 | issue=12}}</ref>

===Indian===
Ancient [[Hindu]] scriptures known as [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] contain fictional descriptions of depression and anxiety states. Mental disorders were generally thought to reflect abstract metaphysical entities, supernatural agents, sorcery or witchcraft. A work known as the [[Charaka Samhita]] from circa 600 BC, part of the Hindu [[Ayurveda]] ("knowledge of life"), saw ill health as resulting from an imbalance among three kinds of bodily fluids or forces called ([[Dosha]]). Different personality types were also described, with different propensities to worries or difficulties. Suggested causes included inappropriate diet; disrespect towards the gods, teachers or others; mental shock due to excessive fear or joy; and faulty bodily activity. Treatments included the use of herbs and ointments, charms and prayers, moral or emotional persuasion, and shocking the person.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bhugra | first1 = D. | year = 1992 | title = Psychiatry in ancient Indian texts: a review | url = http://hpy.sagepub.com/cgi/content/refs/3/10/167 | journal = History of Psychiatry | pmid = 11623029 | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 167–186 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9200301002 }}</ref>

===Chinese===
Mental disorders were treated mainly under [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] by herbs, [[acupuncture]] or "emotional therapy". The [[Huangdi Neijing|Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor]] described symptoms, mechanisms and therapies for mental illness, emphasizing connections between bodily organs and emotions. Conditions were thought to comprise [[Wu Xing|five stages or elements]] and imbalance between [[Yin and yang]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Zou |last= Yizhuang M.D |url=http://www.cma-mh.org/english/articlecontent.asp?articleId=27355  |title=History of Chinese Psychiatry |work=Chinese Society of Psychiatry |date= 20 February 2005 |accessdate=9 August 2008 }}</ref>

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
In ancient Greece and Rome, madness was associated stereotypically with aimless wandering and violence. However, [[Socrates]] considered positive aspects including prophesying (a ‘manic art’); mystical initiations and rituals; poetic inspiration; and the madness of lovers. Now often seen as the very epitome of rational thought and as the founder of philosophy, Socrates freely admitted to experiencing what are now called "command [[hallucinations]]" (then called his ‘daemon’). [[Pythagoras]] also heard voices.<ref name="Pilgrim2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Pilgrim | first1 = D | title = The survival of psychiatric diagnosis. | journal = Social science & medicine (1982) | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 536–47 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17470381 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.03.054 }}</ref> [[Hippocrates]] (470-ca.360 BC) classified mental disorders, including paranoia, epilepsy, mania and melancholia.<ref>Stephen Hinshaw, The Mark of Shame, p57</ref>

Through long contact with Greek culture, and their eventual conquest of Greece, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] absorbed many Greek (and other) ideas on medicine.<ref>von Staden, "Liminal Perils: Early Roman Receptions of Greek Medicine," in ''Tradition, Transmission, Transformation'', ed. F. Jamil Ragep and Sally P. Ragep with Steven Livesey (Leiden: Brill, 1996), pp. 369–418.</ref> The humoral theory fell out of favor in some quarters. The Greek physician [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]] (c. 124 – 40 BC), who practiced in Rome, discarded it and advocated humane treatments, and had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. [[Arateus]] (ca AD 30–90) argued that it is hard to pinpoint where a mental illness comes from. However, [[Galen]] (AD 129 –ca. 200), practicing in Greece and Rome, revived humoral theory.<ref name="Davison2006">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115 | last1 = Davison | first1 = K. | year = 2006 | title = Historical aspects of mood disorders | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476179306700246 | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 115–118 }}</ref> Galen, however, adopted a single symptom approach rather than broad diagnostic categories, for example studying separate states of sadness, excitement, confusion and memory loss.<ref name="Pilgrim2007"/>

Playwrights such as [[Homer]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] described madmen driven insane by the gods, imbalanced humors or circumstances. As well as the triad (of which mania was often used as an overarching term for insanity) there were a variable and overlapping range of terms for such things as delusion, eccentricity, frenzy, and lunacy. Physician [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] argued that insanity is really present when a continuous dementia begins due to the mind being at the mercy of imaginings. He suggested that people must heal their own souls through philosophy and personal strength. He described common practices of [[dietetics]], bloodletting, drugs, talking therapy, [[incubation (ritual)|incubation]] in temples, [[exorcism]], [[incantations]] and [[amulets]], as well as restraints and "tortures" to restore rationality, including starvation, being terrified suddenly, agitation of the spirit, and [[stoning]] and beating. Most, however, did not receive medical treatment but stayed with family or wandered the streets, vulnerable to assault and derision. Accounts of delusions from the time included people who thought themselves to be famous actors or speakers, animals, inanimate objects, or one of the gods. Some were arrested for political reasons, such as [[Jesus ben Ananias]] who was eventually released as a madman after showing no concern for his own fate during torture.

===Hebrew and Israelite===
Passages of the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]] have been interpreted as describing mood disorders in figures such as [[Job (Bible)|Job]], [[King Saul]] and in the psalms of David.<ref name="Davison2006"/> [[Nebuchadnezzar]] is described as temporarily losing his sanity.<ref>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel%204.25-34&version=TNIV;NASB;YLT</ref> Mental disorder was not a problem like any other, caused by one of the gods, but rather caused by problems in the relationship between the individual and God.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Middle Ages==

===Persia, Arabia and the Muslim Empire===

[[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Arabs|Arabic]] scholars were heavily involved in translating, analysing and synthesising Greek texts and concepts. As the [[Muslim world]] expanded, Greek concepts were integrated with religious thought and over time, new ideas and concepts were developed. Arab texts from this period contain discussions of melancholia, mania, hallucinations, delusions, and other mental disorders. Mental disorder was generally connected to loss of reason, and writings covered links between the brain and disorders, and spiritual/mystical meaning of disorders.<ref name=Dening1996>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9600702503 | last1 = Youssef | first1 = Hanafy A. | last2 = Youssef | first2 = Fatma A. | last3 = Dening | year = 1996 | first3 = T.R. | title = Evidence for the existence of schizophrenia in medieval Islamic society | url = http://hpy.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/25/055 | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 25| pages = 55–62 | pmid = 11609215 }}</ref> wrote about fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsessions.

Under Islam, the mentally ill were considered incapable yet deserving of humane treatment and protection. For example, [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5 of the [[Qur'an]] states "Do not give your property which God assigned you to manage to the insane: but feed and cloth the insane with this property and tell splendid words to him"<ref name=Paladin>{{cite journal | last1 = Paladin | first1 = A.

In [[Morocco]] the traditional [[Berber people]] were [[animists]] and the concept of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] was integral to the understanding of mental disorder; it was mixed with the Islamic concepts of djin and often treated by religious scholars combining the roles of [[holy man]], [[Wise old man|sage]], [[wikt:seer|seer]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = D. | year = 2000 | title = Views of mental illness in Morocco: Western medicine meets the traditional symbolic | journal = CMAJ | pmid = 11192655 | volume = 163 | issue = 11| pages = 1468–1470 | pmc = 80417 }}</ref>

The first [[psychiatric hospital|psychiatric hospital ward]] was founded in [[Baghdad]] in 705, and insane asylums were built in [[Fes]] in the early 8th century, [[Cairo]] in 800 and in [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] in 1270. Insane patients were treated using baths, drugs, music and activities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In the centuries to come, The Muslim world would eventually serve as a critical [[way station]] of knowledge for [[Renaissance]] Europe, through the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations of many scientific Islamic texts]].

===Christian Europe===
Conceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Europe were a mixture of the [[divinity|divine]], [[devil|diabolical]], [[magical]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]]. Theories of the [[humorism|four humors]] (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) were applied, sometimes separately (a matter of "physic") and sometimes combined with theories of evil spirits (a matter of "faith"). [[Arnaldus de Villanova]] (1235–1313) combined "evil spirit" and Galen-oriented "four humours" theories and promoted [[trephining]] as a cure to let demons and excess humours escape. Other bodily remedies in general use included [[purges]], [[bloodletting]] and [[Flagellation|whipping]]. Madness was often seen as a moral issue, either a punishment for sin or a test of faith and character. Christian theology endorsed various therapies, including fasting and prayer for those estranged from God and [[exorcism]] of those possessed by the devil.<ref name="Laffey2003">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0033291703008109 | last1 = Laffey | first1 = P | title = Psychiatric therapy in Georgian Britain | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 1285–97 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14580082 }}</ref> Thus, although mental disorder was often thought to be due to [[sin]], other more mundane causes were also explored, including intemperate diet and alcohol, overwork, and grief.<ref name=Kroll>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700015105 | last1 = Kroll | first1 = J. | last2 = Bachrach | first2 = B. | year = 1984 | title = Sin and mental illness in the Middle Ages | url = | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 507–514 | pmid = 6387755 }}</ref> The Franciscan monk [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]] (ca. 1203 – 1272) described a condition which resembles depression in his encyclopedia, ''De Proprietatibis Rerum'', and he suggested that music would help.

The care of lunatics was primarily the responsibility of the family. In [[Kingdom of England|England]], if the family were unable or unwilling, an assessment was made by [[The Crown|crown]] representatives in consultation with a local jury and all interested parties, including the subject himself or herself. The process was confined to those with real estate or [[personal estate]], but it encompassed poor as well as rich and took into account psychological and social issues. Most of those considered lunatics at the time probably had more support and involvement from the community than people diagnosed with mental disorders today.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roffe | first1 = D. | last2 = Roffe | first2 = C. | year = 1995 | title = Madness and care in the community: a medieval perspective | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/7021/1708 | journal = BMJ | volume = 311 | issue = 7021| pages = 1708–1712 | pmid = 8541770 | pmc = 2539103 }}</ref> As in other eras, visions were generally interpreted as meaningful [[vision (spirituality)|spiritual]] and [[visionary]] insights; some may have been causally related to mental disorders, but since [[hallucinations]] were culturally supported they may not have had the same connections as today.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00005053-198201000-00007 | last1 = Kroll | first1 = J | last2 = Bachrach | first2 = B | title = Visions and psychopathology in the Middle Ages | journal = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 170 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–9 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7033474 }}</ref>

==Modern period==

===16th to 18th centuries===
Some mentally disturbed people may have been victims of the [[witch-hunts]] that spread in waves in [[early modern Europe]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1520-6696(197710)13:4<337::AID-JHBS2300130406>3.0.CO;2-G | last1 = Schoeneman | first1 = TJ | title = The role of mental illness in the European witch hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: an assessment | journal = Journal of the history of the behavioral sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–51 | year = 1977 | pmid = 336681 }}</ref> However, those judged insane were increasingly admitted to local [[workhouses]], [[poorhouses]] and jails (particularly the "[[pauper]] insane") or sometimes to the new private madhouses.<ref name="Wright1997">{{cite journal | last1=Wright | first1=D | title=Discussion point.

By the mid-19th century there would be 100 to 500 inmates in each. The development of this network of madhouses has been linked to new capitalist social relations and a service economy, that meant [[families]] were no longer able or willing to look after disturbed relatives.<ref name="Crossley2006">Crossley, N.

Madness was commonly depicted in literary works, such as the plays of [[Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dalby | first1 = JT. | year = 1997 | title = Elizabethan madness: On London's stage | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 81 | issue = 3 Pt 2| pages = 1331–1343 | pmid = 9461770 | doi = 10.2466/pr0.1997.81.3f.1331 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stompe | first1 = T | last2 = Ritter | first2 = K | last3 = Friedmann | first3 = A | title = The representation of madness in William Shakespeare's characters | journal = Wiener klinische Wochenschrift | volume = 118 | issue = 15–16 | pages = 488–95 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16957981 | doi = 10.1007/s00508-006-0641-y }}</ref>

By the end of the 17th century and into the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon, no longer involving the soul or moral responsibility. The mentally ill were typically viewed as insensitive wild animals. Harsh treatment and restraint in chains was seen as therapeutic, helping suppress the animal passions. There was sometimes a focus on the management of the environment of madhouses, from diet to exercise regimes to number of visitors. Severe somatic treatments were used, similar to those in medieval times.<ref name="Laffey2003"/> Madhouse owners sometimes boasted of their ability with the [[whip]]. Treatment in the few public asylums was also barbaric, often secondary to prisons. The most notorious was [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]] where at one time spectators could pay a penny to watch the inmates as a form of entertainment.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9014074 "Bedlam", Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved 3 June 2007]</ref><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02387b.htm "Bedlam", James J. Walsh, Catholic Encyclopedia, retrieved 3 June 2007]</ref>

Concepts based in humoral theory gradually gave way to metaphors and terminology from mechanics and other developing [[physical sciences]]. Complex new schemes were developed for the [[classification of mental disorders]], influenced by emerging systems for the [[biological classification]] of organisms and [[nosology|medical classification]] of diseases.

The term "crazy" (from [[Middle English]] meaning cracked) and insane (from [[Latin]] insanus meaning unhealthy) came to mean mental disorder in this period. The term "lunacy", long used to refer to periodic disturbance or epilepsy, came to be synonymous with insanity. "Madness", long in use in root form since at least the early centuries AD, and originally meaning crippled, hurt or foolish, came to mean loss of reason or self-restraint. "Psychosis", from Greek "principle of life/animation", had varied usage referring to a condition of the mind/soul. "Nervous", from an Indo-European root meaning to wind or twist, meant [[muscle]] or [[vigor]], was adopted by physiologists to refer to the body's electrochemical signalling process (thus called the [[nervous system]]), and was then used to refer to nervous disorders and [[neurosis]]. "Obsession", from a Latin root meaning to sit on or sit against, originally meant to besiege or be possessed by an evil spirit, came to mean a fixed idea that could decompose the mind.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0010-440X(93)90063-A | last1 = Dalby | first1 = JT. | year = 1993 | title = Terms of Madness: Historical Linguistics | url = | journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 392–395 | pmid = 8131383 }}</ref>

With the rise of madhouses and the professionalization and specialization of medicine, there was considerable incentive for [[medical doctors]] to become involved. In the 18th century, they began to stake a claim to a monopoly over madhouses and treatments. Madhouses could be a lucrative business, and many made a fortune from them. There were some [[bourgeois]] ex-patient reformers who opposed the often brutual regimes, blaming both the madhouse owners and the medics, who in turn resisted the reforms.<ref name="Crossley2006"/>

Towards the end of the 18th century, a [[moral treatment]] movement developed, that implemented more humane, psychosocial and personalized approaches. Notable figures included the medic [[Vincenzo Chiarugi]] in Italy under [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] leadership; the ex-patient superintendent [[Pussin]] and the psychologically inclined medic [[Phillipe Pinel]] in revolutionary France; the [[Quakers]] in England, led by businessman [[William Tuke]]; and later, in the United States, campaigner [[Dorothea Dix]].

===19th century===

The 19th century, in the context of industrialization and population growth, saw a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country, a process called "the great confinement" or the "asylum era". Laws were introduced to compel authorities to deal with those judged insane by family members and hospital superintendents. Although originally based on the concepts and structures of moral treatment, they became large impersonal institutions overburdened with large numbers of people with a complex mix of mental and social-economic problems.<ref name="Wright1997"/> The success of moral treatment had cast doubt on the approach of medics, and many had opposed it, but by the mid-19th century many became advocates of it but argued that the mad also often had physical/organic problems, so that both approaches were necessary. This argument has been described as an important step in the profession's eventual success in securing a monopoly on the treatment of lunacy. However, it is well documented that very little therapeutic activity occurred in the new asylum system, that medics were little more than administrators who seldom attended to patients, and then mainly for other physical problems.<ref name="Crossley2006"/>

Clear descriptions of some [[syndromes]], such as the condition that would later be termed [[schizophrenia]], have been identified as relatively rare prior to the 19th century,<ref>Torrey (p339-342) comments that very early mental illness descriptions do not seem to fit schizophrenia , there is a ‘sporadic presence’ from 17th century, and then c.1800 "suddenly… it appeared."

Numerous different [[classification of mental disorders|classification schemes]] and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, taking an increasingly anatomical-clinical descriptive approach. The term "[[psychiatry]]" was coined as the medical specialty became more academically established. Asylum superintendents, later to be psychiatrists, were generally called "alienists" because they were thought to deal with people [[Social alienation|alienated]] from society; they adopted largely isolated and managerial roles in the asylums while milder "neurotic" conditions were dealt with by neurologists and general physicians, although there was overlap for conditions such as [[neurasthenia]].<ref>American Neurological Association [http://www.aneuroa.org/html/c19html/setup19.htm Neurology and Psychiatry: Together and Separate] Retrieved on 07-24-2008</ref>

In the United States it was proposed that [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] who tried to escape were suffering from a mental disorder termed [[drapetomania]]. It was then argued in scientific journals that mental disorders were rare under conditions of slavery but became more common following [[emancipation]], and later that mental illness in African Americans was due to evolutionary factors or various negative characteristics, and that they were not suitable for therapeutic intervention.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1176/appi.ap.28.3.226 | last1 = Harris | first1 = H.W. | last2 = Felder | first2 = D. | last3 = Clark | first3 = M.O. | year = 2004 | title = A Psychiatric Residency Curriculum on the Care of African American Patients | url = http://www.ap.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/3/226 | journal = Academic Psychiatry | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 226–239 | pmid = 15507559 }}</ref>

By the 1870s in North America, officials who ran Lunatic Asylums renamed them Insane Asylums. By the late century, the term "asylum" had lost its original meaning as a place of refuge, [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] or [[safety]], and was associated with abuses that had been widely publicized in the media, including by ex-patient organization the [[Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society]] and ex-patients like [[Elizabeth Packard]].<ref name="Reaume2002"/>

The relative proportion of the public officially diagnosed with mental disorders was increasing, however. This has been linked to various factors, including possibly humanitarian concern; incentives for professional status/money; a lowered tolerance of communities for unusual behavior due to the existence of asylums to place them in (this affected the poor the most); and the strain placed on families by industrialization.<ref name="Crossley2006"/>

===20th century===
The turn of the 20th century saw the development of [[psychoanalysis]], which came to the fore later. Kraepelin's classification gained popularity, including the separation of mood disorders from what would later be termed schizophrenia.<ref>Berrios G E & Porter R (eds) (1995) ''The history of Clinical Psychiatry''. London, Athlone Press</ref>

Asylum superintendents sought to improve the image and medical status of their profession. Asylum "inmates" were increasingly referred to as "patients" and asylums renamed as hospitals. Referring to people as having a "mental illness" dates from this period in the early 20th century.<ref name="Reaume2002"/>

In the United States, a "mental hygiene" movement, originally defined in the 19th century, gained momentum and aimed to "prevent the disease of insanity" through [[public health]] methods and clinics.<ref name=Mandell2007>Mandell, W. (2007) [http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/mh/about/origins.html Origins of Mental Health: The Realization of an Idea]. Johns Hopkins University website. Retrieved 9 August 2008.</ref> The term [[mental health]] became more popular, however. [[Clinical psychology]] and [[social work]] developed as [[professions]] alongside psychiatry. Theories of [[eugenics]] led to [[compulsory sterilization]] movements in many countries around the world for several decades, often encompassing patients in public mental institutions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kavles | first1 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Eugenics and human rights | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7207/435 | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7207| pages = 435–438 | pmid = 10445929 | pmc = 1127045 }}</ref> [[World War I]] saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed "[[shell shock]]".

In [[Nazi]] Germany, the institutionalized mentally ill were among the earliest targets of sterilization campaigns and covert "[[euthanasia]]" programs.<ref>

In other areas of the world, funding was often cut for asylums, especially during periods of economic decline, and during wartime in particular many patients starved to death.<ref name="Fakhourya2007">{{cite journal|last1= Fakhoury|first1= W|last2= Priebe|first2= S|title= Deinstitutionalization and reinstitutionalization: major changes in the provision of mental healthcare|journal= Psychiatry|volume= 6|pages= 313–316|year= 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.mppsy.2007.05.008|issue= 8 }}</ref> Soldiers received increased psychiatric attention, and [[World War II]] saw the development in the US of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) followed suit with a section on mental disorders.

Previously restricted to the treatment of severely disturbed people in asylums, psychiatrists cultivated clients with a broader range of problems, and between 1917 and 1970 the number practicing outside institutions swelled from 8 percent to 66 percent.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Rosenthal |first1= S. |date=19 May 2008 |url=http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/05/mental-illness-or-social-sickness/ |title=Mental Illness or Social Sickness? |work= Dissident Voice |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}</ref> The term [[stress (biological)|stress]], having emerged out of [[endocrinology]] work in the 1930s, was popularized with an increasingly broad biopsychosocial meaning, and was increasingly linked to mental disorders.<ref name="Viner1999">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/030631299029003003|last1=Viner|first1=R. |title=Putting Stress in Life: Hans Selye and the Making of Stress Theory|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=29|issue=3|pages=391–410|year=1999|jstor=285410}}</ref>"[[Outpatient commitment]]" laws were gradually expanded or introduced in some countries.

[[lobotomy|Lobotomies]], [[Insulin shock therapy]], [[Electro convulsive therapy]], and the "[[neuroleptic]]" [[chlorpromazine]] came in to use mid-century.

An [[antipsychiatry]] movement came to the fore in the 1960s. [[Deinstitutionalization]] gradually occurred in the West, with isolated [[psychiatric hospitals]] being closed down in favor of [[community mental health services]]. However, inadequate services and continued social exclusion often led to many being [[homeless]] or in prison.<ref name=Torreyetal1992>{{Cite book |year=1992 |author=Torrey, E. Fuller |authorlink=E.

Other kinds of [[psychiatric medication]] gradually came into use, such as "[[antidepressants|psychic energizers]]" and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. [[Benzodiazepines]] gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity. Advances in [[neuroscience]] and [[genetics]] led to new research agendas. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] was developed. Through the 1990s, new SSRI [[antidepressants]] became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world.

The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based [[classification of mental disorders|classification]], representing a return to a Kraepelin-like descriptive system. The number of "official" diagnoses saw a large expansion, although homosexuality was gradually downgraded and dropped in the face of human rights protests. Different regions sometimes developed alternatives such as the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] or [[Latin American Guide for Psychiatric Diagnosis]].

===21st century===
Starting from 2002 [[DSM-5]] Research Agenda researchers were invited to contribute with their publication to the literature basis for the DSM-5, whose draft criteria are now available to the scientific community [http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx]. In the meanwhile, serious limits of the current version of the DSM extremely high comorbidity, diagnostic heterogeneity of the categories, unclear boundaries have been interpreted as intrinsic anomalies of the criterial, neopositivistic approach leading the system to a state of scientific crisis.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Aragona | first1 = Massimiliano |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/v016/16.1.aragona.pdf |title=The role of comorbidity in the crisis of the current psychiatric classification system |pages=1–11|year=2009|volume=16|journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology |doi=10.1353/ppp.0.0211 | format=PDF }}</ref> Accordingly, a radical rethinking of the concept of mental disorder and the need of a radical scientific revolution in psychiatric taxonomy was proposed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aragona | first1 = Massimiliano | year = 2009 | title = The concept of mental disorder and the DSM-V | url = http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-02.pdf | journal = Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–14 }}</ref>
