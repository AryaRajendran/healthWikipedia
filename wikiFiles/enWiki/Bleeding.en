'''Bleeding''', technically known as '''hemorrhaging''' or '''hæmorrhaging''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|American and British spelling differences]]), is the loss of [[blood]] or blood escaping from the [[circulatory system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/bleeding|title=Bleeding Health Article|publisher=Healthline|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from [[blood vessel]]s inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the [[Mouth (human)|mouth]], [[human nose|nose]], [[ear]], [[urethra]], [[vagina]] or [[anus]], or through a break in the [[human skin|skin]].
[[Desanguination]] is a massive blood loss, and the complete loss of blood is referred to as [[exsanguination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exsanguination|title=Dictionary Definitions of Exsanguination|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10–15% of the total blood volume without serious [[sequela|medical difficulties]], and [[blood donation]] typically takes 8–10% of the donor's blood volume.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b36faint.html|title=Blood Donation Information|publisher=UK National Blood Service|accessdate=2007-06-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928035216/http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b36faint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref>

===Blood loss===
Hemorrhaging is broken down into four classes by the American College of Surgeons' [[advanced trauma life support]] (ATLS).<ref>Manning, JE "Fluid and Blood Resuscitation" in Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. JE Tintinalli Ed. McGraw-Hill: New York 2004. p227</ref>

* '''Class I Hemorrhage''' involves up to 15% of blood volume. There is typically no change in vital signs and [[fluid resuscitation]] is not usually necessary.
* '''Class II Hemorrhage''' involves 15-30% of total blood volume. A patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart beat) with a narrowing of the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with [[Vasoconstriction|peripheral vasoconstriction]]. Skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids ([[Saline (medicine)|Saline solution]] or [[Lactated Ringer's solution]]) is all that is typically required. [[Blood transfusion]] is not typically required.
* '''Class III Hemorrhage''' involves loss of 30-40% of circulating blood volume. The patient's [[blood pressure]] drops, the [[heart rate]] increases, peripheral hypoperfusion ([[shock (circulatory)|shock]]), such as [[capillary refill]] worsens, and the mental status worsens. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary.
* '''Class IV Hemorrhage''' involves loss of >40% of circulating blood volume. The limit of the body's compensation is reached and aggressive resuscitation is required to prevent death.

This system is basically the same as used in the staging of [[hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]].

Individuals in excellent physical and [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] shape may have more effective compensatory mechanisms before experiencing cardiovascular collapse. These patients may look deceptively stable, with minimal derangements in vital signs, while having poor peripheral perfusion. Elderly patients or those with chronic medical conditions may have less tolerance to blood loss, less ability to compensate, and may take medications such as betablockers that can potentially blunt the cardiovascular response. Care must be taken in the assessment of these patients.

== Causes ==

Bleeding arises due to either '''traumatic injury''', underlying '''medical condition''', or a '''combination'''.

=== Traumatic Injury ===

Traumatic bleeding is caused by some type of injury.  There are different types of [[wound]]s which may cause traumatic bleeding.  These include:

* '''[[Abrasion (medical)|Abrasion]]''' - Also called a graze, this is caused by transverse action of a foreign object against the skin, and usually does not penetrate below the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]
* '''[[Excoriation]]''' - In common with Abrasion, this is caused by mechanical destruction of the skin, although it usually has an underlying medical cause
* '''[[Hematoma]]''' - Caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes blood to collect under the skin.
* '''[[Laceration]]''' - Irregular wound caused by blunt impact to soft tissue overlying hard tissue or tearing such as in childbirth.  In some instances, this can also be used to describe an incision.
* '''[[Incision]]''' - A cut into a body tissue or organ, such as by a [[scalpel]], made during surgery.
* '''Puncture [[Wound]]''' - Caused by an object that penetrated the skin and underlying layers, such as a nail, needle or knife
* '''[[Bruise|Contusion]]''' - Also known as a bruise, this is a blunt trauma damaging tissue under the surface of the skin
* '''Crushing Injuries''' - Caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a period of time. The extent of a crushing injury may not immediately present itself.
* '''[[Ballistic trauma|Ballistic Trauma]]''' - Caused by a projectile weapon such as a firearm. This may include two external wounds (entry and exit) and a contiguous wound between the two

The pattern of injury, evaluation and treatment will vary with the mechanism of the injury. Blunt trauma causes injury via a shock effect; delivering energy over an area. Wounds are often not straight and unbroken skin may hide significant injury. Penetrating trauma follows the course of the injurious device. As the energy is applied in a more focused fashion, it requires less energy to cause significant injury. Any body organ, including bone and brain, can be injured and bleed. Bleeding may not be readily apparent; internal organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen may bleed into the abdominal cavity. The only apparent signs may come with blood loss. Bleeding from a bodily orifice, such as the rectum, nose, ears may signal internal bleeding, but cannot be relied upon. Bleeding from a [[medical procedure]] also falls into this category.

=== Medical condition ===

'Medical bleeding' denotes hemorrhage as a result of an underlying medical condition (i.e. causes of bleeding that are not directly due to trauma). Blood can escape from [[blood vessel]]s as a result of 3 basic patterns of injury:

* '''[[blood|Intravascular changes]]''' - changes of the blood within vessels (e.g. ↑ [[blood pressure]], ↓ [[clotting factors]])
* '''[[blood vessel|Intramural changes]]''' - changes arising within the walls of blood vessels (e.g. [[aneurysms]], [[aortic dissection|dissections]], [[arteriovenous malformation|AVMs]], [[vasculitides]])
* '''Extravascular changes''' - changes arising outside blood vessels (e.g. [[Helicobacter pylori|''H pylori'']] infection, [[brain abscess]], [[brain tumor]])

The underlying scientific basis for blood clotting and hemostasis is discussed in detail in the articles, [[blood coagulation|Coagulation]], [[hemostasis]] and related articles. The discussion here is limited to the common practical aspects of blood clot formation which manifest as bleeding.

Certain medical conditions can also make patients susceptible to bleeding. These are conditions that affect the normal "hemostatic" functions of the body. [[Hemostasis]] involves several components. The main components of the hemostatic system include [[platelets]] and the [[blood coagulation|coagulation]] system.

[[Platelets]] are small blood components that form a plug in the blood vessel wall that stops bleeding. Platelets also produce a variety of substances that stimulate the production of a blood clot. One of the most common causes of increased bleeding risk is exposure to [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (or "NSAIDs").  The prototype for these drugs is aspirin, which inhibits the production of thromboxane.  NSAIDs inhibit the activation of [[platelets]], and thereby increase the risk of bleeding.  The effect of aspirin is irreversible; therefore, the inhibitory effect of aspirin is present until the platelets have been replaced (about ten days).  Other NSAIDs, such as "ibuprofen" (Motrin) and related drugs, are reversible and therefore, the effect on platelets is not as long-lived.

There are several named coagulation factors that interact in a complex way to form blood clots, as discussed in the article on [[coagulation]]. Deficiencies of coagulation factors are associated with clinical bleeding.  For instance, deficiency of Factor VIII causes classic [[Hemophilia A]] while deficiencies of Factor IX cause "Christmas disease"([[hemophilia B]]). Antibodies to Factor VIII can also inactivate the Factor VII and precipitate bleeding that is very difficult to control.  This is a rare condition that is most likely to occur in older patients and in those with [[autoimmune]] diseases.  [[von Willebrand disease]] is another common bleeding disorder. It is caused by a deficiency of or abnormal function of the "von Willebrand" factor, which is involved in platelet activation. Deficiencies in other factors, such as factor XIII or factor VII are occasionally seen, but may not be associated with severe bleeding and are not as commonly diagnosed.

In addition to NSAID-related bleeding, another common cause of bleeding is that related to the medication, [[warfarin]] ("Coumadin" and others).  This medication needs to be closely monitored as the bleeding risk can be markedly increased by interactions with other medications.  Warfarin acts by inhibiting the production of [[Vitamin K]] in the gut.   Vitamin K is required for the production of the clotting factors, II, VII, IX, and X in the liver.  One of the most common causes of warfarin-related bleeding is taking antibiotics. The gut bacteria make vitamin K and are killed by antibiotics. This decreases vitamin K levels and therefore the production of these clotting factors.

Deficiencies of platelet function may require platelet transfusion while deficiencies of clotting factors may require transfusion of either [[fresh frozen plasma]] or specific clotting factors, such as [[Factor VIII]] for patients with hemophilia.
