The '''globose nucleus''' is one of the deep cerebellar nuclei. It is located medial to the [[emboliform nucleus]] and lateral to the [[fastigial nucleus]]. This nucleus contains primarily large and small multipolar neurons.

The ''globose nucleus'' and [[emboliform nucleus]] are occasionally referred to collectively as the [[interposed nucleus]].
