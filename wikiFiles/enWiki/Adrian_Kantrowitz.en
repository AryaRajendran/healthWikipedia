'''Adrian Kantrowitz''' (October 4, 1918 &ndash; November 14, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[cardiac surgeon]] whose team performed the world's first pediatric heart transplant at [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] on December 6, 1967. The actual surgery was performed in the middle of the night by his resident.  It was only the second time that a human heart had been transplanted into another human being, taking place just three days after [[Christiaan Barnard]]'s seminal attempt in [[South Africa]] made headlines around the world and ushered in a new era in clinical organ transplantation. Kantrowitz also invented the [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] (IABP), a [[left ventricular assist device]] (L-VAD), and an early version of the implantable pacemaker.

==Biography==
Kantrowitz was born in New York City on October 4, 1918. His mother was a costume designer and his father ran a clinic in [[the Bronx]]. He told his mother as a three-year old that he wanted to be a doctor, and as a child built an [[electrocardiograph]] from old radio parts together with his brother.<ref name=NYTObit/>

===Education and military service===
He graduated from [[New York University]] in 1940, having majored in math. He attended the Long Island College of Medicine (now [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]]) and was awarded his medical degree in 1943 as part of an effort to accelerate the availability of physicians during [[World War II]].<ref name=NYTObit/> During an internship at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn, he developed an interest in [[neurosurgery]], and had a paper published in 1944 paper, "A Method of Holding Galea [[Hemostat]]s in Craniotomies", in which he proposed a new type of clamp to be used while performing a [[craniotomy]] during brain surgery.<ref name=NLM/>

He served for two years as a [[battalion surgeon]] in the [[United States Army Medical Corps]].<ref name=NYTObit/> Kantrowitz was discharged from the Army in 1946 with the rank of major.<ref name=NLM/>

After his military service, he switched to specialize in [[cardiac surgery]] due to the paucity of positions in neurosurgery. In 1947, he was an [[Residency (medicine)|Assistant Resident]] in Surgery at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=NLM/>

===Montefiore Hospital===
He was on the surgical staff of [[Montefiore Medical Center|Montefiore Hospital]] in the Bronx from 1948 until 1955.<ref name=NYTObit/> He started at Montefiore as Assistant Resident in Surgery and Pathology, and progressed to Cardiovascular Research [[Fellowship (medicine)|Fellow]] before becoming Chief Resident in Surgery. At the [[New York Academy of Medicine]], on October 16, 1951, he screened the world's first movies taken inside a living heart, showing the sequential opening and closing of the [[mitral valve]] inside a beating heart. Using dogs and other animals as experimental subjects, Kantrowitz developed an artificial left heart, an early version of an oxygen generator for use as a component in a [[heart-lung machine]] and a treatment for [[coronary artery disease]] in which blood vessels would be rearranged during surgery.<ref name=NLM>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/ead/kantrowitz572.html Finding Aid to the Adrian Kantrowitz Papers, 1944-2004], [[United States National Library of Medicine]]. Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref> He also developed a device that allowed individuals who were paralyzed to have their bladders empty through a signal sent from a radio-controlled device.<ref name=NYTObit/>

===Maimonides Medical Center===
From 1955 to 1970, he held surgical posts at [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in Brooklyn.<ref name=NYTObit/> In February 1958, a [[heart-lung machine]] Kantrowitz had developed was used during [[open heart surgery]] on a six-year-old boy while the surgeons repaired a one-inch hole between the chambers of the boy's heart that was present since birth.<ref>Staff.

Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref> In an October 1959 lecture at the [[American College of Surgeons]], Kantrowitz and colleague Dr. William M. P. McKinnon reported on a procedure in which a portion of muscle from the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] was used to create a "booster" heart to help pump blood in a dog, taking over as much as 25% of the pumping burden of the natural heart. The booster heart functions by receiving a signal sent by a radio transmitter triggered by the pulse of the natural heart. Kantrowitz noted that the procedure was not ready to be performed on humans.<ref>Kaplan, Morris. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10915F73555127B93CBA9178BD95F4C8585F9 "MUSCLE BECOMES AUXILIARY HEART; Surgeon's Session Is Told of Experiments Shifting Diaphragms of Dogs"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 9, 1958. Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref> Ruff, a "friendly dog of unknown ancestry" was honored by the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] as "research dog of the year" for his unwitting participation in the implantation of a booster heart 18 months earlier in a procedure performed by Kantrowitz.<ref>Staff.

Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref>

In the early 1960s, Kantrowitz developed an implantable [[artificial pacemaker]] together with [[General Electric]]. The first of these pacemakers was implanted in May 1961. The device included an external control unit that could adjust the pacing rate from 64 to 120 beats per minute to allow the patient to deal with physical or emotional stress.<ref>Kirk, Jeffrey. [http://books.google.com/books?id=sy-mQbaTVSQC&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=pacemaker+implantable+kantrowitz&source=bl&ots=X6o2GF_P_I&sig=nWSROjczq6oLXYYZS7-dxq3-VtM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result "Machines in Our Hearts: The Cardiac Pacemaker, the Implantable Defibrillator, and American Health Care"], via [[Google Books]]. JHU Press, 2001.  ISBN 0-8018-6579-4. Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref>

Throughout the 1960s, he collaborated with a team that included his brother, engineer [[Arthur Kantrowitz]], on the development of a [[left ventricular assist device]]. Building on his experiments with dogs, he performed the world's second permanent partial mechanical heart implantation in a human on February 4, 1966, which was successful, though the patient died 24 hours after surgery as a result of preexisting liver disease. His second implant of a partial mechanical heart on a 63-year old woman, on May 18, 1966, lasted 13 days, until the patient died of a stroke.<ref name=NLM/> During these almost two weeks after the surgery, the patient was improving, and was able to sit up and eat well. This surgery used a valveless device developed with his brother Arthur in which the natural electrical impulses of the patient's heart controlled the action of the pump.<ref>Staff. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835723,00.html "An Implanted Half Heart"], ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', June 3, 1966. Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref>

In what turned out to be a race with [[South Africa]]n cardiac surgeon, Dr. [[Christiaan Barnard]], Kantrowitz prepared for a potential human heart transplant by transplanting hearts in 411 dogs over a five-year period together with members of his surgical team. Barnard performed the first human-to-human heart transplant on December 3, 1967.<ref name=NLM/>

On December 6, 1967, Kantrowitz performed the first human [[heart transplant]] in the United States, removing the heart of a brain-dead baby and implanting it into the chest of a 19-day-old infant who had a heart defect that would have been fatal. The recipient lived for a little more than six hours after the surgery.<ref>Lyons, Richard D. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50913FB3C5A157B93C5A91789D95F438685F9 "Heart Transplant Fails to Save 2-Week-old Baby in Brooklyn; Heart Transplant Fails to Save Baby Infants' Surgery Harder Working Side by Side Gives Colleague Credit"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 7, 1967.

Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref>

The [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] was invented by Adrian Kantrowitz, working in conjunction with his brother, [[Arthur Kantrowitz]]. Inserted through the patient's thigh, it was directed into the [[aorta]], and alternately expanded and contracted in order to reduce strain on the heart. Based on Kantrowitz's theory of "counterpulsation", the device inflated the balloon with helium gas when the heart relaxed and deflated it when the heart pumped blood.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref name=NLM/> The pump did not require surgery and could be inserted using local anesthetic in an emergency room or at a patient's bedside. The device was first used in August 1967 to save the life of a 45-year-old woman who was having a heart attack. The device could be used in the 15% of heart attack patients who went into severe shock, 80% of whom could not be helped by the protocols that existed before the balloon pump.<ref>[[Jane Brody|Brody, Jane E.]] [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10714FA345E137A93CBA81783D85F438685F9 "HEART PUMP SAVES VICTIM OF ATTACK; Balloon Device Is Described by Maimonides Specialist"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 19, 1967. Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref> Since the device went into widespread use in the 1980s, it had been used in some three million patients by the time of his death.<ref name=NYTObit/>

===Sinai Hospital===
He and his entire team of surgeons, researchers, biomedical engineers, and nurses relocated to Sinai Hospital (now [[Sinai-Grace Hospital]]) in [[Detroit]] in 1970, where he assumed the position of attending surgeon and Chairman of the Department of Surgery.<ref name=NLM/> 

At Sinai Hospital, Kantrowitz experimented further with heart transplants and continued development of the balloon pump, and partial mechanical hearts.<ref name=NLM/> In August 1971, he implanted an artificial heart booster in a 63-year-old man whose weakened heart could not pump sufficient oxygenated blood to his body.<ref>Staff. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877287,00.html "Assist for an Ailing Heart"], ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', August 23, 1971. Accessed November 19, 2008.</ref> The patient became the first partial mechanical heart patient to be sent home, and died three months after the surgery.<ref name=NLM/>

===Personal===
Kantrowitz married Jean Rosensaft on November 25, 1948. His wife was an administrator on the surgical research laboratories at Maimonides Medical Center while he was there. In 1983, they co-founded L.VAD Technology, Inc., a company specializing in research and development of cardiovascular devices, with Dr. Kantrowitz as president and his wife as vice president.<ref name=NLM/>

Kantrowitz died at age 90 in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] on November 14, 2008 of [[heart failure]].<ref name=NYTObit>Hoffman, Jascha.
