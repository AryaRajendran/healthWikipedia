The '''Schola Medica Salernitana''' ({{lang-it|Scuola Medica Salernitana}}) was the world's first [[medical school]]. Situated on the Tyrrhenian Sea in the [[Mezzogiorno|south Italian]] city of [[Salerno]], it was the most important source of medical knowledge in [[Western Europe]] at the time. Arabic medical treatises, both those that were translations of Greek texts and those that were originally written in Arabic, had accumulated in the [[library]] of [[Montecassino]], where they were translated into [[Latin]]; thus the received lore of [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]] and [[Dioscorides]] was supplemented and invigorated by [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical]] practice, known from contacts with [[Sicily]] and [[North Africa]]. As a result, the medical practitioners of Salerno, both men and women, were unrivalled in the medieval Western Mediterranean for practical concerns.

The school, which found its original base in the [[dispensary]] of a [[monastery]] founded in the 9th century, achieved its utmost splendour between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, from the last decades of [[Lombards|Lombard]] power, during which its fame began to spread more than locally, to the fall of the [[Hohenstaufen]]. The arrival in Salerno of [[Constantine the African|Constantine Africanus]] in 1077, marked the beginning of Salerno's classic period. Through the encouragement of [[Alfano I, Archbishop of Salerno]] and translations of Constantine Africanus, [[Salerno]] gained the title of "Town of [[Hippocrates]]" (''Hippocratica Civitas'' or ''Hippocratica Urbs''). People from all over the world flocked to the "Schola Salerni", both the sick, in the hope of recovering, and students, to learn the art of medicine. 

Johannes (d.February 2, 1161) and Matthaeus Plantearius, possible father and son, resided in Salerno at this time when they apparently published their famous "Liber de Simplici Medicina" (a.k.a. "Circa Instans") which is first recorded in Salerno under their name early in the 13th Century.  Subsequent incarnations:   c.1480 now found in Brussels; and in the early 1500s, published in Paris with art by [[Robinet Testard]] and now found in both Paris and St.Petersburg, bore the name "Livre des simples medecines".  Facsimiles with commentary for both editions have been published by Opsomer and Stearn (1984) and by Moleiro (2001).

Its fame crossed borders, as proved by the Salernitan manuscripts kept in many European libraries, and by historical witnesses. The twelfth or thirteenth-century author of the poem ''[[Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum]]'' gave a Salernitan provenance to his poem, in order to advertise his work and give validity to it. The school kept the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]-[[Ancient Rome|Latin]] medical tradition going, merging it with the [[Arab]] and [[Jewish]] medical traditions. The meeting of different cultures led to a synthesis and the comparison of different medical knowledge, as evidenced by a legend that ascribes the foundation of the school to four masters: the Jewish Helinus, the Greek Pontus, the Arab Adela, and the Latin Salernus. In the school, besides the teaching of medicine (in which women too were involved, as both teachers and students), there were courses of [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[law]]. 

The most famous female doctor and medical author at the school is [[Trotula]] or Trotula de Ruggiero who is accredited with several books on gynaecology and cosmetics, collectively known as The Trotula. De Passionibus Mulierum Curandorum was first published around 1100 AD and was a prominent text until a major revision by Louise Bourgoise, a midwife whose husband worked as assistant Ambrose Par√© in the early 1600s.<ref name="Ferraris">{{cite web |url=http://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/64/6/1855 |title=The Women of Salerno: Contribution to the Origins of Surgery From Medieval Italy -- Ferraris and Ferraris 64 (6): 1855 -- The Annals of Thoracic Surgery}}</ref> A further 19 less definitive manuscripts by Trotula can be found in European libraries today.

Books made the Salernitan school famous. They had a strong start with the ''[[Pantegni]]'', Constantine's translation and adaptation of the ''Al-malaki'' of [[Haly Abbas]], ten volumes of theoretical medicine and ten of practical medicine. He had also translated a treatise on the ophthalmology of [[Hunayn bin Ishaq]] and the ''Viaticus'' of [[Ibn al Jazzar]].   

Among the physicians who trained at the Schola Medica Salernitana is [[Gilles de Corbeil]].

By the thirteenth century the medical school at [[Montpellier]] began to eclipse the Salernitan school.
