'''Obstetric ultrasonography''' is the application of [[medical ultrasonography]] to [[obstetrics]], in which sonography is used to visualize the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] in its mother's [[uterus]] (womb).  The procedure is a standard part of [[Pregnancy|prenatal]] care, as it yields a variety of information regarding the health of the mother and of the fetus, the progress of the pregnancy, and further information on the baby.

==Types==
Traditional obstetric sonograms are done by placing a [[transducer]] on the [[abdomen]] of the pregnant woman.  One variant, a ''transvaginal sonography,'' is done with a probe placed in the woman's [[vagina]].  Transvaginal scans usually provide clearer pictures during early pregnancy and in [[Obesity|obese]] women. Also used is ''Doppler sonography'' which detects the heartbeat of the fetus.  Doppler sonography can be used to evaluate the pulsations in the fetal heart and bloods vessels for signs of abnormalities.<!--

==Early pregnancy==
The [[gestational sac]] can sometimes be visualized as early as four and a half weeks of [[gestational age|gestation]] (approximately two and a half weeks after ovulation) and the [[yolk sac]] at about five weeks gestation. The [[Human embryo|embryo]] can be observed and measured by about five and a half weeks.  The [[Heart development|heartbeat]] may be seen as early as 6 weeks, and is usually visible by 7 weeks gestation.<ref name="woo" /><!--

The rate of miscarriage, especially [[threatened miscarriage]],  drops significantly if normal heartbeat is detected.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miscarriage|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001488.htm |publisher=A.D.A.M., Inc.|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=21 Nov 2010}}</ref>

==Dating and growth monitoring==
[[Gestational age]] is usually determined by the date of the woman's last menstrual period, and assuming ovulation occurred on day fourteen of the [[menstrual cycle]].  Sometimes a woman may be uncertain of the date of her last menstrual period, or there may be reason to suspect ovulation occurred significantly earlier or later than the fourteenth day of her cycle.  Ultrasound scans offer an alternative method of estimating gestational age.  The most accurate measurement for dating is the [[crown-rump length]] of the fetus, which can be done between 7 and 13 weeks of gestation.  After 13 weeks of gestation, the fetal age may be estimated using the biparietal diameter (the transverse diameter of the head), the head circumference, the length of the [[femur]], the crown-heel length (head to heel), and other fetal parameters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opregnancy.com/pregnancy-week-by-week/|title= Pregnancy Week by Week|year=2009|publisher=OPregnancy.com|accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref>  Dating is more accurate when done earlier in the pregnancy; if a later scan gives a different estimate of gestational age, the estimated age is not normally changed but rather it is assumed the fetus is not growing at the expected rate.<ref name="woo" />

Not useful for dating, the abdominal circumference of the fetus may also be measured.  This gives an estimate of the weight and size of the fetus and is important when doing serial ultrasounds to monitor fetal growth.<ref name="woo" />

==Fetal sex discernment==
{{See also|Prenatal sex discernment}}
[[Image:Boy.JPG|thumb|right|Sonogram of male fetus, with scrotum and penis in center of image]]
The sex of the fetus may be discerned by ultrasound as early as 11 weeks gestation. The accuracy is relatively imprecise when attempted early.<ref name=isbn_1588901475 /><ref name=pmid_10380292 /><ref name=pmid_17851807 /> After 13 weeks gestation, a high accuracy of between 99% to 100% is possible if there is no malformed external genitalia.<ref name=pmid_19099612 /> 

The following is accuracy data from two hospitals:

==Ultrasonography of the cervix==
[[Image:Embryo at 14 weeks profile.JPG|thumb|right|Fetus at 14 weeks (profile)]]
Obstetric sonography has become useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for [[premature birth]].  A short cervix preterm is undesirable: At 24 weeks gestation a cervix length of less than 25&nbsp;mm defines a risk group for preterm birth, further, the shorter the cervix the greater the risk.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199602293340904 |title=The Length of the Cervix and the Risk of spontaneous Premature Delivery |year=1996 |last1=Iams |first1=Jay D. |last2=Goldenberg |first2=Robert L. |last3=Meis |first3=Paul J. |last4=Mercer |first4=Brian M. |last5=Moawad |first5=Atef |last6=Das |first6=Anita |last7=Thom |first7=Elizabeth |last8=McNellis |first8=Donald |last9=Copper |first9=Rachel L. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=334 |issue=9 |pages=567–72 |pmid=8569824}}</ref> It also has been helpful to use ultrasonography in women with preterm contractions, as those whose cervix length exceed 30&nbsp;mm are unlikely to deliver within the next week.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70407-2 |title=Cervical length and dilatation of the internal cervical os detected by vaginal ultrasonography as markers for preterm delivery: A systematic review |year=1999 |last1=Leitich |first1=Harald |last2=Brunbauer |first2=Mathias |last3=Kaider |first3=Alexandra |last4=Egarter |first4=Christian |last5=Husslein |first5=Peter |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=181 |issue=6 |pages=1465–72 |pmid=10601930}}</ref>

==Abnormality screening==

In some countries, routine [[pregnancy]] sonographic scans are performed to detect developmental defects before birth.  This includes checking the status of the limbs and vital organs, as well as (sometimes) specific tests for abnormalities.  Some abnormalities detected by ultrasound can be addressed by medical treatment [[in utero]] or by [[perinatal]] care, though indications of other abnormalities can lead to a decision regarding [[abortion]].

Perhaps the most common such test uses a measurement of the [[nuchal translucency]] thickness ("NT-test", or "Nuchal Scan").  Although 91% of fetuses affected by [[Down syndrome]] exhibit this defect, 5% of fetuses flagged by the test do not have Down syndrome.

Ultrasound may also detect fetal organ anomaly.  Usually scans for this type of detection are done around 18 to 20 weeks of [[gestational age]].

==History==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Scottish physician [[Ian Donald]] was one of the pioneers of medical use of ultrasound. His article "Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound" was published in ''The Lancet'' in 1958.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13550965 |year=1958 |last1=Donald |first1=I |last2=MacVicar |first2=J |last3=Brown |first3=TG |title=Investigation of abdominal masses by pulsed ultrasound |volume=1 |issue=7032 |pages=1188–95 |journal=Lancet}}</ref> Donald was Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow.<ref>[http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/lancet.html Ian Donald's paper in the ''Lancet'' in 1958] by Joseph Woo{{Self-published inline|date=March 2012}}</ref>

In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner.  Their work had been supported by [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Services]] and the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado]]. Wright and Meyerdirk left the university to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963.<!--

Obstetric ultrasound has played a significant role in the development of diagnostic ultrasound technology in general.  Much of the technological advances in diagnostic ultrasound technology are due to the drive to create better obstetric ultrasound equipment.  [[Acuson Corporation|Acuson Corporation's]] pioneering work on the development of Coherent Image Formation helped shape the development of diagnostic ultrasound equipment as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Safety issues==
[[File:Fetal spine 19 weeks Dr Wolfgang Moroder.theora.ogv|thumb|3D rendering of the fetal spine in a scan at 19 weeks of pregnancy]]
Current evidence indicates that diagnostic ultrasound is safe for the unborn child, unlike [[Radiography|radiographs]], which employ [[ionizing radiation]].  However, no [[randomized controlled trial]]s have been undertaken to test the safety of the technology, and thus ultrasound procedures are generally not done repeatedly unless medically indicated.

A 2006 study on genetically modified mice exposed to ultrasound (5–240 minutes a day) showed neurological changes in the exposed fetuses. Some of the rodent brain cells failed to migrate to their proper position and remained scattered in incorrect parts of the brain.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=2006PNAS..10312903A |title=Prenatal exposure to ultrasound waves impacts neuronal migration in mice |author1=Ang |first1=Eugenius S. B. C. |last2=Gluncic |first2=Vicko |last3=Duque |first3=Alvaro |last4=Schafer |first4=Mark E. |last5=Rakic |first5=Pasko |volume=103 |year=2006 |pmid=16901978 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Science |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605294103 |issue=34 |pages=12903–10 |pmc=1538990}}</ref>

It has been shown that [[Low intensity pulsed ultrasound|Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound]] does have a localized effect on growth in human beings. The 1985 maximum power allowed by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of 180 milliwatts per square cm <ref>{{cite book |last=Freitas |first=Robert A. |title=Nanomedicine |year=1999 |publisher=Landes Bioscience |location=Austin, TX |isbn=978-1-57059-645-2 |url=http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/6.4.1.htm}}{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}</ref> is well under the levels used in [[medical ultrasonography|therapeutic ultrasound]], but still higher than the 30-80 milliwatts per square cm range of the Statison V veterinary LIPUS device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statison V Operations Manual|url=http://www.statison.com/html/Statison_V_User_Guide.pdf|publisher=Statison Medical, Inc.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080527203244/http://www.statison.com/html/Statison_V_User_Guide.pdf|archivedate=27 May 2008|year=1997}}</ref> LIPUS has been shown to affect tissue growth in as little as 20 minutes of time with repeated daily applications. Adding to the similarity, LIPUS and medical ultrasound both operate in the 1 to 10&nbsp;MHz range.

While the benefits of medical ultrasound outweigh any risks, vanity uses such as making [[3D ultrasound]] movies without a doctor's order present a possibly unnecessary, but unknown risk to a developing fetus. The FDA discourages its use for non-medical purposes such as fetal keepsake videos and photos, even though it is the same technology used in hospitals. The demand for keepsake ultrasound products in medical environments has prompted commercial solutions such as self-serve software that allows the patient to create a "keepsake" from the ultrasound imagery recorded during a medical ultrasound procedure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/PatientAlerts/ucm064756.htm |title=Fetal Keepsake Videos|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref>


==Social Implications==

The increasingly widespread use of ultrasound technology in monitoring pregnancy has had a great impact on the way in which women and societies at large conceptualise and experience pregnancy and childbirth <ref>[Gammeltoft, Tine, 2007, Sonography and Sociality – Obstetrical Ultrasound Imagining in Urban Vietnam, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 21:2, 133-153]</ref>. The pervasive spread of obstetric ultrasound technology around the world and the conflation of its use with creating a ‘safe’ pregnancy as well as the ability to see and determine features like the sex of the foetus impact the way in which pregnancy is experienced and conceptualised <ref>[Gammeltoft, Tine, 2007, Sonography and Sociality – Obstetrical Ultrasound Imagining in Urban Vietnam, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 21:2, 133-153]</ref>. This “technocratic takeover” <ref>[Gammeltoft, Tine, 2007, Sonography and Sociality – Obstetrical Ultrasound Imagining in Urban Vietnam, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 21:2, 133-153]</ref> of pregnancy is not limited to western or developed nations but also effects conceptualisations and experiences in developing nations and is an example of the increasing medicalisation of pregnancy, a phenomena that has social as well as technological ramifications <ref>[Gammeltoft, Tine, 2007, Sonography and Sociality – Obstetrical Ultrasound Imagining in Urban Vietnam, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 21:2, 133-153]</ref>. Ethnographic research concerned with the use of ultrasound technology in monitoring pregnancy can show us how it has changed the embodied experience of expecting mothers around the globe <ref>[Gammeltoft, Tine, 2007, Sonography and Sociality – Obstetrical Ultrasound Imagining in Urban Vietnam, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 21:2, 133-153]</ref>.
