In [[human anatomy]], the '''subtalar joint''', also known as the
'''talocalcaneal joint''', is a [[joint]] of the [[foot]].  It occurs at the meeting point of the [[Talus bone|talus]] and the [[calcaneus]].

==Motion==
The joint allows [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inversion]] and [[Eversion (kinesiology)|eversion]] of the foot, but plays no role in [[dorsiflexion]] or [[plantarflexion]] of the foot.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kyung Won, PhD. Chung |title=Gross Anatomy (Board Review) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2005 |isbn=0-7817-5309-0 |oclc= |doi= |page=123}}</ref>

It is considered a plane synovial joint,<ref>Moore and Agur. Essential Clinical Anatomy. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. 2007. ISBN 978-0-7817-6274-8</ref> also commonly referred to as a condyloid joint.

The subtalar joint can also be considered a combination of the anatomic subtalar joint discussed above, and also the talocalcaneal part of the [[talocalcaneonavicular joint]]. This is the more common view of the subtalar joint when discussing its movement. When both of these articulations are accounted together, it allows for [[pronation]] and [[supination]] to occur.

==Relation of bones==
The talus is oriented slightly obliquely on the anterior surface of the calcaneus.  

There are two points of articulation between the two bones: one anteriorly and one posteriorly: 
 
* At the ''anterior talocalcaneal articulation'', a [[wikt:convex|convex]] area of the talus fits on a [[wikt:concave|concave]] surface of the calcaneus.  
* The ''posterior talocalcaneal articulation'' is formed by a concave surface of the talus and a convex surface of the calcaneus.

The subtalar joint contributes to 10% of dorsiflexion of the ankle.

==Ligaments and membranes==
The main [[ligament]] of the joint is the [[interosseous talocalcaneal ligament]], a thick, strong band of two partially joined fibers that bind the talus and calcaneus.  It runs through the [[sinus tarsi]], a canal between the articulations of the two bones.

There are four additional ligaments that form weaker connections
between the talus and calcaneus.  

* The [[anterior talocalcaneal ligament]] (or anterior interosseous ligament) attaches at the neck of the talus on the front and lateral surfaces to the superior calcaneus. 

* The short band of the [[posterior talocalcaneal ligament]] extends from the lateral tubercle of the talus to the upper medial calcaneus.

* The short, strong [[lateral talocalcaneal ligament]] connects from the lateral talus under the fibular facet to the lateral calcaneus, and runs parallel to the [[calcaneofibular ligament]]. 
 
* The [[medial talocalcaneal ligament]] extends from the medial tubercle of the talus to the [[sustentaculum tali]] on the medial surface of the calcaneus.

A [[synovial membrane]] lines the capsule of the joint, and the joint
is wrapped in a capsule of short fibers that are continuous with the
talocalconeonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints of the foot.
