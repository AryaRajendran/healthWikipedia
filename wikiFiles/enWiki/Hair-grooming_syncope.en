'''Hair-grooming syncope''' (also known as '''hair-combing syncope''') is a form of [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (a fainting disorder) associated with combing and brushing one's [[hair]]. It is most typically seen in children aged five to sixteen.

Hair-grooming syncope typically manifests as [[syncope (medicine)|presyncopal]] symptoms during hair combing, brushing, braiding, trimming, curling, or blow drying.<ref name=riv/><ref name=lew/> These symptoms are followed by loss of consciousness and [[convulsions]].<ref name=lew/> [[Migraine]]s, abdominal pain, "feeling funny" or blurred vision may also occur before or after seizures.<ref name=riv/><ref name=iga/> Possible causes of the condition include pain or nerve stimulation on the scalp (similar to parade-ground syncope), or compression of blood vessels or nerves resulting from neck [[flexion]] or [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]].<ref name=lew>{{cite journal|title=Hair-grooming syncope seizures|journal=Pediatrics|volume=91|issue=4|author=Lewis, Donald; Frank, L.

Hair-grooming syncope may be misdiagnosed as [[epilepsy]], but is better described as a "paroxysmal non-epileptic event".<ref name=riv>{{cite journal|last=Riviello|first=James J.|coauthors=Rioux, Stephen D.|title=Hair-braiding and combing-induced syncope: A paroxysmal nonepileptic event|journal=Journal of Epilepsy|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=6|issue=2|pages=115–117|doi=10.1016/S0896-6974(05)80099-4}}</ref> It may also be related to orthostatic [[hypotension]].<ref name=iga>{{cite journal|last=Igarashi|first=Masanori|coauthors=Boehm, Robert M; May, William N; Bornhofen, John H|title=Syncope associated with hair-grooming|journal=Brain and Development|volume=10|issue=4|pages=249–251|doi=10.1016/S0387-7604(88)80006-8}}</ref> The condition is not associated with heart abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fainting by Follicle|journal=Pediatrics for Parents|volume=26|issue=3|page=1|date=March 2010}}</ref>

This form of syncope is a possible explanation for hair-brushing syndrome, an extremely rare condition in which [[static electricity]] is said to interrupt brain or organ function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/23/megan-stewart-brushing-hair-deadly_n_931566.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=23 August 2011|title=For this girl, brushing her hair could be life-threatening}}</ref> Only two cases of hair-brushing syndrome have been reported worldwide, one of which garnered media attention in 2011 when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' announced that hair brushing could cause death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2027043/Megan-Stewarts-rare-reaction-static-electricity-means-die-brushes-hair.html|work=Daily Mail|author=Barnes, Julie-Anne|date=18 August 2011|title=Brush with death}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/08/18/teen-with-rare-condition-could-die-from-brushing-hair/|date=18 August 2011|title=Teen with rare condition could die from brushing hair}}</ref>
