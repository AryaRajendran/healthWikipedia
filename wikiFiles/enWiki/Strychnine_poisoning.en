'''[[Strychnine]] poisoning''' can be fatal to humans and other animals and can occur by inhalation, swallowing or absorption through eyes or mouth. It produces some of the most dramatic and painful symptoms of any known toxic reaction. For this reason, strychnine poisoning is often portrayed in literature and film.

==Presentation in humans==
Ten to twenty minutes after exposure, the body's [[muscle]]s begin to spasm, starting with the head and neck in the form of [[trismus]] and [[risus sardonicus]]. The spasms then spread to every muscle in the body, with nearly continuous convulsions, and get worse at the slightest stimulus. The convulsions progress, increasing in intensity and frequency until the backbone arches continually. Convulsions lead to [[lactic acidosis]], [[hyperthermia]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]]. These are followed by [[Postictal state|postictal]] depression.  Death comes from asphyxiation caused by paralysis of the neural pathways that control breathing, or by exhaustion from the convulsions. The subject dies within 2–3 hours after exposure.

One medical student in 1896 described the experience in a letter to [[the Lancet]]:

<blockquote>
Three years ago I was reading for an examination,
and feeling "run down". I took 10 minims of strychnia
solution (B.P.) with the same quantity of dilute [[phosphoric acid]]
well diluted twice a day. On the second day of taking
it, towards the evening, I felt a tightness in the "facial
muscles " and a peculiar metallic taste in the mouth. There was
great uneasiness and restlessness, and I felt a desire to walk
about and do something rather than sit still and read.
I lay on the bed and the calf muscles began to stiffen and 
jerk. My toes drew up under my feet, and as I moved or
turned my head flashes of light kept darting across my eyes..
I then knew something serious was developing, so I crawled
off the bed and scrambled to a case in my room and got out
(fortunately) the [[potassium bromide|bromide of potassium]] and the [[chloral]]. I
had no confidence or courage to weigh them, so I guessed
the quantity-about 30 gr. bromide of potassium and 10 gr.
chloral-put them in a tumbler with some water, and drank
it off. My whole body was in a cold sweat, with [[Angina pectoris|anginous]]
attacks in the [[precordium|precordial region]], and a feeling of "going
off." I did not call for medical aid, as I thought the symptoms
declining. I felt better, but my lower limbs were as cold as ice and the calf muscles kept tense and,
jerking. There was no [[opisthotonos]], only a slight stiffness 
at the back of the neck. Half an hour later, as I could
judge, I took the same quantity of bromide of potassium
and chloral, and a little time after I lost consciousness and
fell into a " profound sleep," awaking in the morning with 
no unpleasant symptoms, no headache, &c., but a desire " to
be on the move " and a slight feeling of stiffness in the jaw.
These worked off during the day.

==Treatment==
There is no specific antidote for strychnine. Treatment of strychnine poisoning involves an oral application of an [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]] infusion which serves to absorb any poison within the digestive tract that has not yet been absorbed into the blood. Anticonvulsants such as [[phenobarbital]] or [[diazepam]] are administered to control convulsions, along with muscle relaxants such as [[dantrolene]] to combat muscle rigidity.<ref>[http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/strychni.htm Strychnine:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> If the patient survives past 24 hours, recovery is probable.

The treatment for strychnine poisoning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was to administer [[tannic acid]] which precipitates the strychnine as an insoluble tannate salt, and then to [[anesthesia|anaesthetise]] the patient with [[chloroform]] until the effects of the strychnine had worn off.

==Detection in biological specimens==
Strychnine is easily quantitated in body fluids and tissues using instrumental methods in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. The concentrations in blood or urine of those with symptoms are often in the 1–30&nbsp;mg/L range.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1448-1450.</ref>

==Strychnine toxicity in animals==
Strychnine poisoning in animals occurs usually from ingestion of baits designed for use against rodents (especially [[gopher (animal)|gopher]]s and [[mole (animal)|mole]]s) and [[coyote]]s.  Rodent baits are commonly available over-the-counter, but coyote baits are illegal in the United States. However, since 1990 in the United States most baits containing strychnine have been replaced with [[zinc phosphide]] baits.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{Citation|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  The most common domestic animal to be affected is the [[dog]], either through accidental ingestion or intentional poisoning.  An approximate lethal dose for a dog is 0.75 [[milligram|mg]] per [[kilogram|kg]] body weight.<ref name=Beasley>{{cite web|author=Beasley, V.|year=1999|title=Toxicants Associated with Seizures|work=Veterinary Toxicology|url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Beasley/Cpt2B/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1#| accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref>

The onset of symptoms is 10 to 120 minutes after ingestion.<ref name=Beasley/> Symptoms include [[seizure]]s, a "[[sawhorse]]" stance, and [[opisthotonus]] (rigid extension of all four limbs).  Death is usually secondary to respiratory paralysis. Treatment is by detoxification using activated charcoal, [[pentobarbital]] for the symptoms, and [[artificial respiration]] for [[apnea]].

In most western nations a special license is needed to use and possess strychnine for agricultural use.
