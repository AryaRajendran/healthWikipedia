A '''free clinic''' is a [[clinic|medical facility]] offering community [[healthcare]] on a free or very low-cost basis in countries with marginal or no [[universal health care]].  Care is generally provided in these clinics to persons who have lower or limited income and no [[health insurance]], including persons who are not eligible for US [[Medicaid]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] programs. In the US, almost all free clinics provide care for acute, non-emergent conditions.  Many also provide a full range of primary care (including preventive care) and care for chronic conditions.  Some free clinics include licensed [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] and [[dentistry|dental]] services.

==History==
The modern notion of a free clinic began in the 1960s in [[San Francisco]] when Dr. David Smith founded the [[Haight Ashbury Free Clinics]] in 1967 <ref>Seymour, Richard (1987). The Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinics: Still free after all these years, 1967-1987. San Francisco, California: Partisan Press.</ref> during the [[summer of love]] in the Haight Ashbury district. Free clinics quickly spread to other [[California]] cities and the rest of the United States. In 1972 a meeting was held at the [[Shoreham Hotel]] in Washington DC where clinic staff from around the country gathered and listened to speakers including Dr. Smith. At this meeting the slogan “Health Care is a Right Not a Privilege” emerged as a theme. 

During the 1970s and 80s free clinics continued to evolve and change to meet the needs of their individual communities, however some were unable to survive. Each free clinic was unique in its development and services, based on the particular needs and resources of the local community. There is a saying among free clinic organizations that if you have been to one free clinic you have been to one free clinic. The common denominator is that care is made possible through the service of volunteers, the donation of goods and community support. Funding is generally donated on the local level and there is little —if any— government funding. Some free clinics were established to provide medical services in the inner cities while others opened in the suburbs and many student-run free clinics have emerged that serve the under-served as well as provide a medical training site for students in the health professions. 

While both free and community clinics provide many similar services, free clinics today are defined by the US National Association of Free Clinics as “safety-net health care organizations that utilize a volunteer/staff model to provide a range of medical, dental, pharmacy, vision and/or behavioral health services to economically disadvantaged individuals. Such clinics are [[501c3 | 501(c)3]] tax-exempt organizations, or operate as a program component or affiliate of a 501(c)(3) organization.”<ref name="Definition of Free Clinic">{{cite web|last=NAFC|title=What is a Free or Charitable Clinic?|url=http://nafcclinics.org/about-us/what-is-free-charitable-clinic|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref>  Some free clinics rival local government health departments in size and scope of service with multi-million dollar budgets, specialized clinics and numerous locations.
