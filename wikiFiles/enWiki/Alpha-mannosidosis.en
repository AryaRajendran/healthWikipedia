==Pathophysiology==

A defective [[alpha-mannosidase|α-mannosidase]] [[enzyme]], which normally helps to break down complex [[sugar]]s derived from [[glycoprotein]]s in the [[lysosome]], causes sugar build up and impairs [[cell (biology)|cell]] function. Complete absence of functional enzyme leads to death during early childhood due to deterioration of the [[central nervous system]]. Enzyme with low residual activity leads to a milder type of the disease, with symptoms like reduced hearing, mental retardation, susceptibility to bacterial infections and skeletal deformities. The course of the disease is progressive. 

Alpha-Mannosidosis is classified into types I through III based on severity and age of onset. In contrast to the usual classifications scheme of these disorders, type III is the most severe.

==Symptoms==
[[Image:Alpha-mannosidosis.JPEG|thumb|Facial features in alpha-mannosidosis. A. Twins aged 18 Months. Note enlarged head, short neck, rounded eyebrows, saddle nose, and prominent forehead. B. Same twins aged 8 years. Note slight muscular atrophy of the hands. C. Boy, aged 27. Note: Hearing aid.]]
Symptoms range widely in their onset and severity. The onset of the most severe form, type III, begins within the first months of life and includes a quick progression of [[mental retardation]], liver and spleen enlargement ([[splenomegaly]]), hearing loss, respiratory infections and skeletal abnormalities. Often the appearance of an affected individual includes the following facial features: protruding forehead, leveled nasal bridge, small nose and wide mouth. Muscular weakness or spinal abnormalities can occur due to the build up of storage materials in the muscle. A milder form of Alpha-mannosidosis involves mild to moderate mental retardation which develops during childhood or adolescence.

==Diagnosis and Testing==
A diagnosis is made by measuring the enzymatic activity of alpha-D-mannosidase in white blood cells. If there is a decreased level of the enzyme in comparison to standard levels, a diagnosis can be made. It is thought that this disorder might be under-diagnosed for a few different reasons — the diagnosis is often made late in the disease's progression, symptoms are often mild, or the biochemical diagnosis does not yield conclusive results.

==Life Expectancy==
The life expectancy in Alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe disease often do not survive beyond childhood, whereas those with milder disorders may survive well into adult life.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for congenital Alpha-Mannosidosis. Treatment is limited to reducing or controlling the symptoms of this disorder by, for example, taking medication to control seizures, using a hearing aid to assist with hearing loss, and by having routine physical therapy to assist with muscular pain and weakness. In some cases, a wheelchair is recommended if muscle or spinal impairments immobilize the individual affected.

==Genetic prevalence==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Alpha-mannosidosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]  

The worldwide incidence of alpha-mannosidosis is in the range of 1 per 500,000<ref name="pmid18651971"/> to 1 per 1,000,000. Mannosidosis is found in all ethnic groups in Europe, America, Africa and also Asia.
