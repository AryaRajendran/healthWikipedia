'''Mitochondrial [[encephalomyopathy]], [[lactic acidosis]], and [[stroke]]-like episodes''' – abbreviated to '''MELAS''' – is one of the family of [[mitochondrial cytopathies]], which also include [[MERRF]], and [[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy]]. It was first characterized under this name in 1984.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pavlakis SG, Phillips PC, DiMauro S, De Vivo DC, Rowland LP | title=Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes: a distinctive clinical syndrome | journal=Ann Neurol | year=1984 | pages=481–8 | volume=16 | issue=4  | pmid=6093682 | doi=10.1002/ana.410160409}}</ref> A feature of these diseases is that they are caused by defects in the [[mitochondrial]] [[genome]] which is inherited purely from the female parent.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hirano M, Pavlakis SG | title=Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS): current concepts | journal=J Child Neurol | year=1994 | pages=4–13 | volume=9 | issue=1  | pmid=8151079 | doi=10.1177/088307389400900102}}</ref> The disease can manifest in both sexes.

==Presentation==

MELAS is a condition that affects many of the body's systems, particularly the brain and nervous system (encephalo-) and muscles (myopathy). In most cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder appear in childhood following a period of normal development.<ref>{{NLM|mitochondrialencephalomyopathylacticacidosisandstrokelikeepisodes}}</ref> Early symptoms may include muscle weakness and pain, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite, vomiting, and seizures. Most affected individuals experience stroke-like episodes beginning before age 40. These episodes often involve temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), altered consciousness, vision abnormalities, seizures, and severe headaches resembling migraines. Repeated stroke-like episodes can progressively damage the brain, leading to vision loss, problems with movement, and a loss of intellectual function (dementia).

Most people with MELAS have a buildup of [[lactic acid]] in their bodies, a condition called [[lactic acidosis]]. Increased acidity in the blood can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, extreme tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, loss of bowel control, and difficulty breathing. Less commonly, people with MELAS may experience involuntary muscle spasms (myoclonus), impaired muscle coordination ([[ataxia]]), hearing loss, heart and kidney problems, diabetes, epilepsy, and hormonal imbalances.

The presentation of some cases is similar to that of [[Kearns-Sayre syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hirano M, Ricci E, Koenigsberger MR, Defendini R, Pavlakis SG, DeVivo DC, DiMauro S, Rowland LP | title=Melas: an original case and clinical criteria for diagnosis | journal=Neuromuscul Disord | year=1992 | pages=125–35 | volume=2 | issue=2  | pmid=1422200 | doi=10.1016/0960-8966(92)90045-8}}</ref>

MELAS is caused by mutations in the genes in mitochondrial DNA.

===NADH dehydrogenase===

Some of the genes ([[MT-ND1]], [[MT-ND5]]) affected in MELAS encode proteins that are part of [[NADH dehydrogenase]] (also called complex I) in mitochondria, that helps convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy.

===Transfer RNAs===
Other genes ([[MT-TH]], [[MT-TL1]], and [[MT-TV (mitochondrial)|MT-TV]]) encode mitochondrial specific transfer RNAs ([[tRNA]]s).

Mutations in ''MT-TL1'' cause more than 80 percent of all cases of MELAS. They impair the ability of mitochondria to make proteins, use oxygen, and produce energy. Researchers have not determined how changes in mitochondrial DNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of MELAS. They continue to investigate the effects of mitochondrial gene mutations in different tissues, particularly in the brain.

==Inheritance==
This condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as [[maternal inheritance]] and [[heteroplasmy]]. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mitochondrial DNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children. In most cases, people with MELAS inherit an altered mitochondrial gene from their mother. Less commonly, the disorder results from a new mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in people with no family history of MELAS.

==Prognosis==
There is no known treatment for the underlying disease, which is progressive and fatal. Patients are managed according to what areas of the body are affected at a particular time. [[Enzyme]]s, [[amino acids]], [[antioxidant]]s and [[vitamin]]s have been used, but there have been no consistent successes reported.

Although there have been no controlled trials on long-term benefits of dietary manipulations, the following supplements have shown promise and given hope to MELAS patients.

*CoQ10 has been helpful for some MELAS patients.<ref name="pmid17080429">{{cite journal |author=Rodriguez MC, MacDonald JR, Mahoney DJ, Parise G, Beal MF, Tarnopolsky MA |title=Beneficial effects of creatine, CoQ10, and lipoic acid in mitochondrial disorders |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=235–42 |year=2007 |pmid=17080429 |doi=10.1002/mus.20688}}</ref>  [[Nicotinamide]] has been used because complex l accepts electrons from NADH and ultimately transfers electrons to CoQ10.

*[[Riboflavin]] has been reported to improve the function of a patient with complex l deficiency and the 3250T-C mutation.<ref name="pmid9003864">{{cite journal |author=Ogle RF, Christodoulou J, Fagan E, ''et al.'' |title=Mitochondrial myopathy with tRNA(Leu(UUR)) mutation and complex I deficiency responsive to riboflavin |journal=J.

*The administration of [[L-arginine]] during the acute and interictal periods may represent a potential new therapy for this syndrome to reduce brain damage due to impairment of vasodilation in intracerebral arteries due to [[nitric oxide]] depletion.<ref name="pmid17276739">{{cite journal |author=Koga Y, Akita Y, Nishioka J, ''et al.'' |title=MELAS and L-arginine therapy |journal=Mitochondrion |volume=7 |issue=1-2 |pages=133–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17276739 |doi=10.1016/j.mito.2006.11.006}}</ref><ref name="pmid17889473">{{cite journal |author=Hirata K, Akita Y, Povalko N, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of l-arginine on synaptosomal mitochondrial function |journal=Brain Dev |volume= 30|issue= 4|pages= 238|year=2007 |pmid=17889473 |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2007.08.007}}</ref>

*There is evidence from animal studies that [[resveratrol]] and other [[SIRT1]] activators may be used to treat MELAS by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and function. [[Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]], a GlaxoSmithKline company based in Cambridge, MA, is developing a proprietary formulation of resveratrol (called SRT-501) for the treatment of MELAS under [[Orphan Drug]] Designation from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]. Results from this phase 1b trial are expected in the first half of 2009.<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=185399&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1124857&highlight= Sirtris - Investor Relations - News Release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*There is also a case report where succinate was successfully used to treat uncontrolled convulsions in MELAS patients, although this treatment modality is yet to be thoroughly investigated or widely recommended.
