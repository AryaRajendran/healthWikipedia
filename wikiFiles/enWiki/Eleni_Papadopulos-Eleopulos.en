==Views on HIV/AIDS==
In the view of the Perth Group, consisting of Papadopulos-Eleopulos and a colleague, the scientific community has failed to prove:

#That HIV exists as a unique, exogenously acquired [[retrovirus]].
#That [[HIV test|HIV antibody tests]] are [[specificity (tests)|specific]] for HIV infection.
#That HIV causes acquired immune deficiency (destruction of [[T helper cell]]s, known as AID) or that AID leads to the development of the clinical syndrome [[AIDS]].
#That the HIV genome ([[RNA]] or [[DNA]]) originates in a unique, exogenously acquired infectious retroviral particle.
#That HIV/AIDS is infectious, either by blood, [[blood transfusion|blood products]] or sexual intercourse.
#That a retrovirus HIV may be transmitted from [[vertical transmission|mother to child]] or that this transmission may be inhibited with [[Zidovudine|AZT]] or [[nevirapine]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theperthgroup.com/whatargued.html | title = What the Perth Group has argued | publisher = The Perth Group | accessdate = 2010-06-15 | date = nd }}</ref>

The Perth Group's speculation is completely rejected by the [[scientific community]] as HIV has been adequately isolated and shown to be the cause of AIDS.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx | publisher = [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] | title = Fact Sheet: The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS | date = 2010-01-14 | accessdate = 2010-06-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Delaney | first = M | url = http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html | title = HIV, AIDS, and the Distortion of Science | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 1–6 | journal = Focus | year = 2000 | pmid = 12180385 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/connection.aspx | title = The HIV/AIDS Connection | publisher = [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] | accessdate = 2010-06-17 | date = 2005-09-25 }}</ref>

==Lack of academic credentials relevant to HIV==

Papadopulos-Eleopulos does not work in HIV research or with AIDS patients<ref name=PiraniAustralian/> but has been incorrectly represented as a doctor. [[John P. Moore]], an AIDS scientist and authority on [[AIDS denialism]], noted in a presentation at the [[XVI International AIDS Conference]] that some AIDS denialists refer to Papadopulos-Eleopulos as a doctor and claim that she has been a professor of medical physics at Royal Perth Hospital, a government hospital in [[Perth, Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/health_cast/uploaded_files/081306_ias_sat_journalism.pdf |format=PDF| title=HIV Science and Responsible Journalism | work=XVI International AIDS Conference | date=2006-08-13 | accessdate = 2010-06-17 }}</ref> Papadopulos-Eleopulos has no academic appointment and does not hold a [[doctorate]]; her highest academic degree is a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[nuclear physics]] from the [[University of Bucharest]].<ref name="rvparenzee"/> Her duties at the Royal Perth Hospital are to test people for sensitivity to [[ultraviolet radiation]].<ref name="rvparenzee"/> The Royal Perth Hospital has stated that it does not share the views of Papadopulos-Eleopulos.<ref name=PiraniAustralian>

{{Quotation|Royal Perth Hospital does not support The Perth Group's views on HIV, and group members have been instructed that they will not use any hospital resources for work related to their private research.

==Appearance at the appeal trial of Andre Parenzee==

In late 2006 and early 2007, Papadopulos-Eleopulos and the other main Perth Group member, Valendar Turner, testified at the appeal for retrial of an HIV-positive man, [[Andre Chad Parenzee]], who had been convicted on three counts of endangering life through having unprotected sex without informing his partners of his HIV status. Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Turner told the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]] that Parenzee should be acquitted because the existence of HIV had not been proven; HIV tests were unreliable; and there was no evidence for sexual transmission of HIV.<ref name="rvparenzee"/>  Papadopulos-Eleopulos, when asked by a prosecutor if she would herself have unprotected sex with an HIV-positive person, replied, "Any time."<ref name=unprotectedAustralian>{{cite news | first=J| last=Roberts | last2 = Gosch | first2 = E | title=HIV sceptic backs unprotected sex | date=2007-01-31 | url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/hiv-sceptic-backs-unprotected-sex/story-e6frg6nf-1111112916708 | work =The Australian | accessdate = 2010-06-17}}</ref> Medical experts decried Papadopulos-Eleopulos' statements, with one expert witness calling them "insane", "outrageous" and "dangerous" for apparently encouraging unsafe sex.<ref name=PiraniAustralian/>

In his ruling in April 2007, Justice John Sulan dismissed the testimony of Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Turner and rejected the application for a retrial. He said that the pair were not qualified to give expert opinions about the existence or nature of HIV and that, "the probative value of the evidence proposed to be called by the applicant is minimal." According to Justice Sulan:

{{Quotation|One significant feature of the evidence of the applicant’s witnesses was that neither  Papadopulos-Eleopulos nor Dr Turner claimed to have practical experience or qualifications in any of the particular scientific disciplines to which their evidence pertained.<ref name="rvparenzee"/>}}
