== History and vaccine composition ==

=== Polysaccharide vaccine ===

The first Hib vaccine licensed was a pure [[polysaccharide]] vaccine, first marketed in the US in 1985.<ref name="Pink Book">{{cite book
|title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases
|author=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]
|editor=Atkinson W, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, Wolfe S
|edition=9th

|year=2006
}}</ref> Similar to other polysaccharide vaccines, [[immune response]] to the vaccine was highly age-dependent. Children under 18 months of age did not produce a positive response for this vaccine. As a result, the age group with the highest incidence of Hib disease was unprotected, limiting the usefulness of the vaccine. The vaccine was withdrawn from the market in 1988.

=== Conjugate vaccine ===

The shortcomings of the polysaccharide vaccine led to the production of the Hib polysaccharide-[[protein]] conjugate vaccine.<ref name="Pink Book" /> Attaching Hib polysaccharide to a protein carrier greatly increased the ability of the immune system of young children to recognize the polysaccharide and develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. There are currently three types of conjugate vaccine, utilizing different carrier proteins for the conjugation process, all of which are highly effective and safe: inactivated [[tetanospasmin]] (also called [[tetanus]] [[toxoid]]), [[mutant]] [[Corynebacterium diphtheriae|diphtheria]] protein, and [[Neisseria meningitidis|meningococcal]] group B outer [[cell membrane|membrane]] protein.

=== Combination vaccines ===

Multiple [[combination vaccine|combination]]s of Hib and other vaccines have been licensed in the United States, reducing the number of shots necessary to vaccinate a child. Hib vaccine combined with [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis]]-[[polio vaccine]]s and [[Hepatitis B vaccine]]s are available in the US. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has certified several Hib vaccine combinations, including a pentavalent diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-hepatitis B-Hib, for use in developing countries. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this combined pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bar-On ES, Goldberg E, Hellmann S, Leibovici L |title=Combined DTP-HBV-HIB vaccine versus separately administered DTP-HBV and HIB vaccines for primary prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae B (HIB) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD005530 |year=2012 |pmid=22513932 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005530.pub3}}</ref>

== Efficacy ==

Hib conjugate vaccines have been shown to be universally effective against all manifestations of Hib disease, with a clinical [[efficacy]] among fully vaccinated children estimated to be between 95-100%. The vaccine has also been shown to be [[immunogenic]] in patients at high risk of invasive disease. Hib vaccine is not effective against non-type B ''Haemophilus influenzae''. However, non-type B disease is rare in comparison to pre-vaccine ''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B disease.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Safety ==

[[Clinical trial]]s and ongoing surveillance have shown Hib vaccine to be safe. In general, adverse reactions to the vaccine are mild. The most common reactions are mild [[fever]], loss of appetite, transient redness, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], or [[pain]] at the site of injection, occurring in 5-30% of vaccine recipients. More severe reactions are extremely rare.{{Quantify|date=April 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116914]

== Impact ==

Prior to introduction of the conjugate vaccine, Hib was a leading cause of childhood meningitis, [[pneumonia]], and [[epiglottitis]] in the United States, causing an estimated 20,000 cases a year in the early 1980s, mostly in children under 5 years old. Since routine vaccination began, the incidence of Hib disease has declined by greater than 99%, effectively eliminating Hib as a [[public health]] problem. Similar reductions in disease occurred after introduction of the vaccine in [[Western Europe]] and developing countries.

=== Herd immunity ===

Although Hib vaccine is given to children, Hib infections have also decreased in adults. This decrease occurred because of [[herd immunity]]; children infected with Hib carry the bacteria in their [[nasal passage]]s while clearing the infection. These Hib-carrying children would regularly infect adults. The practice of vaccinating children eliminated the source of the bacteria, reducing the rate of Hib in adults. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Recommendations ==

The CDC and WHO currently recommend that all [[infant]]s be vaccinated using a polysaccharide-protein conjugate Hib vaccine, starting after the age of 6 weeks. The vaccination is also indicated in asplenic patients.

== Vaccination in the developing world ==

Introduction of Hib vaccine in developing countries lagged behind that in developed countries for several reasons. The expense of the vaccine was large in comparison to the standard [[Expanded Programme on Immunization|EPI]] vaccines. Poor disease surveillance systems and inadequate hospital laboratories failed to detect the disease, leading many experts to believe that Hib did not exist in their countries. And [[health system]]s in many countries were struggling with the current vaccines they were trying to deliver.

=== GAVI and the Hib Initiative ===

In order to remedy these issues, the [[GAVI Alliance]] took active interest in the vaccine. GAVI offers substantial [[subsidy|subsidization]] of Hib vaccine for countries interested in using the vaccine, as well as financial support for vaccine systems and safe injections. In addition, GAVI created the Hib Initiative to catalyze uptake of the vaccine. The Hib Initiative uses a combination of collecting and disseminating existing data, research, and advocacy to assist countries in the making a decision about using the Hib vaccine. {{As of|2008|alt=Currently}}, 61 out of 72 low-income countries are planning on introducing the vaccine by the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web
