The '''suboccipital triangle''' is a region of the [[neck]] bounded by the following three muscles of the suboccipital group of muscles:

* [[Rectus capitis posterior major]] - above and medially
* [[Obliquus capitis superior]] - above and laterally
* [[Obliquus capitis inferior]] - below and laterally
(Rectus capitus posterior minor is also in this region but does not form part of the triangle)

It is covered by a layer of dense fibro-fatty tissue, situated beneath the [[Semispinalis capitis]].

The floor is formed by the [[posterior atlanto√∂ccipital membrane|posterior occipito-atlantal membrane]], and the [[posterior arch]] of the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]].

In the deep groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of the atlas are the [[vertebral artery]] and the first cervical or [[suboccipital nerve]].

The vertebral artery is accessed here in order to conduct angiography of the [[circle of Willis]].

==Contents of the suboccipital triangle==

1) Third part of [[vertebral artery]]<br />
2) Dorsal ramus of nerve C1-[[suboccipital nerve]]<br />
3) [[Suboccipital venous plexus]]

The purpose of these muscles is to provide fine motor function in movements of the head. The actions of [[trapezius]], [[sternocleidomastoid]] and other larger muscles that move the head are refined by the relatively small suboccipital triangle muscles.
