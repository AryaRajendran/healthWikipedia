'''Scoliosis''' (from {{lang-grc|σκολίωσις|skoliosis|obliquity, bending}})<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scoliosis ''Online Etymology Dictionary'']. Douglas Harper, Historian. Accessed 27 December 2008. Dictionary.com</ref> is a medical condition in which a person's [[Vertebral column|spine]] is curved from side to side. Although it is a complex three-dimensional deformity, on an X-ray, viewed from the rear, the spine of an individual with scoliosis may look more like an "S" or a "C", rather than a straight line. 

Scoliosis is typically classified as either [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] (caused by vertebral anomalies present at birth), [[idiopathic]] (cause unknown, subclassified as infantile, juvenile, adolescent, or adult, according to when onset occurred), or secondary to another primary condition. 

Secondary scoliosis may be the result a [[neuromuscular]] condition ([[spina bifida]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]], or physical trauma), or syndromes such as [[Chiari malformation]].

Recent [[longitudinal studies]] reveal that the most common form of the condition, late-onset idiopathic scoliosis, is physiologically harmless and self-limiting.<ref name="jama.ama-assn.org">{{cite journal

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients having reached skeletal maturity are less likely to have a worsening case. Some severe cases of scoliosis can lead to diminishing lung capacity, putting pressure on the heart, and restricting physical activities.

The signs of scoliosis can include:
*Uneven musculature on one side of the spine
*A [[rib]] prominence and/or a prominent [[shoulder blade]], caused by rotation of the ribcage in [[human thorax|thoracic]] scoliosis
*Uneven hips, arms or leg lengths
*Slow nerve action (in some cases)

===Associated conditions===
Scoliosis is sometimes associated with other conditions, such as  [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]] (hyperflexibility, "floppy baby" syndrome, and other variants of the condition), [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]], [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], [[kyphosis]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[familial dysautonomia]], [[CHARGE syndrome]],  [[Friedreich's ataxia]], [[fragile X syndrome]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Fragile X syndrome|url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/specialist-guides/medical-conditions/a-z-of-medical-conditions/learning-disability/fragile-x-syndrome-ld.shtml|publisher=Department for Work and Pensions, U.K.|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Orthopaedic aspects of fragile-X syndrome|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2195034|publisher=The National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> [[proteus syndrome]], [[spina bifida]], [[Marfan's syndrome]], [[nail–patella syndrome]], [[neurofibromatosis]], [[connective tissue disorder]]s, [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]], [[hemihypertrophy]], and craniospinal axis disorders (e.g., [[syringomyelia]], [[mitral valve prolapse]], [[Arnold–Chiari malformation]]), and [[amniotic band syndrome]].

Scoliosis associated with known syndromes         such as Marfan's or Prader–Willi is often subclassified as "syndromic scoliosis."

==Causes==
An estimated 65% of scoliosis cases are [[idiopathic]], about 15% are [[congenital]] and about 10% are secondary to a [[neuromuscular disease]].<ref name=agabegi2nd90>Page 90 in: {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Scoliosis cobb.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Cobb angle]] measurement of a levoscoliosis]]
Scoliosis is defined as a spinal curvature of more than 10 degrees to the right or left as the examiner faces the patient (in the [[coronal]] plane). Deformity may also exist to the front or back (in the [[sagittal]] plane). 

Patients who initially present with scoliosis are examined to determine whether the deformity has an underlying cause. During a physical examination, the following are assessed to exclude the possibility of underlying condition more serious than simple scoliosis

The patient's [[gait analysis|gait is assessed]], and there is an exam for [[sign (medicine)|sign]]s of other abnormalities (e.g., [[spina bifida]] as evidenced by a [[dimple]], hairy patch, [[lipoma]], or [[hemangioma]]).  A thorough [[neurological examination]] is also performed, THE [[Skin]] for [[café au lait spot|''café au lait'' spots]], indicative of [[neurofibromatosis]], the feet for [[Pes cavus|cavovarus deformity]], abdominal reflexes and muscle tone for [[spasticity]]. 

During the examination, the patient is asked to remove his or her shirt and bend forward. This is known as the Adams forward bend test<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscoliosis.com/symptoms.html |title=Scoliosis symptoms — pain, flat back, screening, self-assessment |work=iscoliosis.com}}</ref> and is often performed on school students. If a prominence is noted, then scoliosis is a possibility and the patient should be sent for an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis.

As an alternative, a scoliometer may be used to diagnose the condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoliosis.org/store/scoliometer.php |title=Scoliometer (Inclinometer) |publisher=National Scoliosis Foundation}}</ref>

When scoliosis is suspected, weight-bearing full-spine AP/[[Coronal plane|coronal]] (front-back view) and [[Sagittal|lateral]]/[[sagittal]] (side view) X-rays are usually taken to assess the scoliosis curves and the [[kyphosis]] and [[lordosis]], as these can also be affected in individuals with scoliosis. Full-length standing spine [[radiography|X-ray]]s are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at three- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, [[MRI]] investigation is warranted to look at the spinal cord.

The standard method for assessing the curvature quantitatively is measurement of the Cobb angle, which is the angle between two lines, drawn perpendicular to the upper endplate of the uppermost vertebra involved and the lower endplate of the lowest vertebra involved. For patients with two curves, Cobb angles are followed for both curves. In some patients, lateral-bending X-rays are obtained to assess the flexibility of the curves or the primary and compensatory curves.

===Genetic testing===
[[Genetic testing for AIS]], which became available in 2009 and is still under investigation, attempts to gauge the likelihood of curve progression.

Through a genome-wide association study, geneticists have identified single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Fifty-three genetic markers have been identified. Scoliosis has been described as a biomechanical deformity, the progression of which depends on asymmetric forces otherwise known as the Heuter-Volkmann law.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ogilvie J |title=Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and genetic testing |journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=67–70 |year=2010 |pmid=19949338 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833419ac}}</ref>

==Management==
The traditional medical management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and [[Bone age|skeletal maturity]], which together help predict the likelihood of progression.

A growing body of scientific research testifies to the efficacy of specialized treatment programs of physical therapy, which may include bracing.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Negrini S, Fusco C, Minozzi S, Atanasio S, Zaina F, Romano M |title=Exercises reduce the progression rate of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: results of a comprehensive systematic review of the literature |journal=Disability and Rehabilitation |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=772–785 |year=2008 |pmid=18432435 |doi=10.1080/09638280801889568}}</ref> 

===Physiotherapy===
The [[Schroth method]], a noninvasive, physiotherapeutic treatment, has been used successfully in Europe since the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Lehnert-Schroth C |title=Dreidimensionale Skoliosebehandlung |publisher=Urban & Schwarzer |location=Stuttgart |year=2000 |edition=6th}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name=b1>{{Cite book|author=Lehnert-Schroth C |title=Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis: A Physiotherapeutic Method for Deformities of the Spine |publisher=The Martindale Press |location=Palo Alto CA |year= 2007|isbn=0-914959-02-6|pages=1–6}}</ref>  Originally developed in Germany by scoliosis sufferer Katharina Schroth, this method is now taught to scoliosis patients in clinics specifically devoted to Schroth therapy in Germany, Spain, England, and North America. The method is based upon the concept of scoliosis as resulting from a complex of muscular asymmetries (especially strength imbalances in the back) that can be at least partially corrected by targeted exercises.<ref name=b1/>

The Schroth method has proven effective at reversing abnormal scoliotic curvatures by an average of 10% in four- to six-week in-patient programs,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=HR|title=Influence of an in-patient exercise program on scoliotic curve|journal=Italian journal of orthopaedics and traumatology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=395–406|year=1992|pmid=1308886}}</ref> and by 30% or more in an out-patient program over a period of a year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Otman|first1=S|last2=Kose|first2=N|last3=Yakut|first3=Y|title=The efficacy of Schroth's 3-dimensional exercise therapy in the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in Turkey|journal=Saudi medical journal|volume=26|issue=9|pages=1429–35|year=2005|pmid=16155663}}</ref> One study of nearly 200 adolescent Schroth patients found no curve progression three years following the in-patient program.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=HR|last2=Lohschmidt|first2=K|last3=El-Obeidi|first3=N|last4=Verres|first4=C|title=Preliminary results and worst-case analysis of in patient scoliosis rehabilitation|journal=Pediatric rehabilitation|volume=1|issue=1|pages=35–40|year=1997|pmid=9689236}}</ref> Several studies have documented the Schroth method's efficacy in substantially reducing or eliminating pain, which tends to be a problem, in particular, for adults.<ref>Weiss HR, "Scoliosis-related pain in adults: Treatment influences," European Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 3/3 (1993): 91–94.</ref>

A certain intensity is necessary to allow the very best compliance with conservative treatment, and to acquire strategies for coping with scoliosis and with the conservative treatment.

The indications for treatment depend on degree of curvature, maturity of the patient, and the individual curve pattern. While evidence supporting such conservative, noninvasive treatments is weak, today, conservative management of scoliosis can be regarded as being evidence-based; no substantial evidence has been found to support surgical intervention.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Weiss HR, Goodall D |title=The treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) according to present evidence.

===Occupational therapy===
An [[occupational therapist]]  helps those who have experienced an injury or illness regain or maintain the ability to participate in everyday activities. For those with scoliosis, an occupational therapist can provide assistance through assessment, intervention, and ongoing evaluation of the condition. This helps them manage physical symptoms so they can participate in [[Activities of daily living|daily activities]] like self-care, productivity, and leisure.

One intervention involves bracing. During the past several decades, a large variety of bracing devices have been developed for the treatment of scoliosis.<ref>{{Cite book|last=DeWald |first=RL |title=Spinal Deformitities: The Comprehensive Text |publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc |location=New York |year=2003}}</ref> Studies demonstrate that preventing force sideways across a joint by bracing prevents further curvature of the spine in idiopathic scoliosis,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bulthuis G.J., Veldhuizen A.G., Nijenbanning G. |title= Clinical effect of continuous corrective force delivery in the non-operative treatment of idiopathic scoliosis: a prospective cohort study of the triac-brace |journal= European Spine Journal |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=231–239 |year=2008 |pmid=17926071 |doi=10.1007/s00586-007-0513-9 |pmc=2226193}}</ref> while other studies have also shown that braces can be used by individuals with scoliosis during physical activities.<ref name="Journal of Chiro">{{Cite journal|author=Green BN, Johson C, Moreau C. |title= Is physical activity contraindicated for individuals with scoliosis? A systematic literature review |journal= Journal of Chiropractic Medicine |volume=8 |pages=25–37 |year=2009 |pmid=19646383 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.jcm.2008.11.001 |pmc=2697577}}</ref>

Other interventions include postural strategies, such as posture training in sitting, standing, and sleeping positions, and in using positioning supports such as pillows, wedges, rolls, and corsets.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Paris MJ, Lang G, Benjamin MJ, Wilcox R. |title= Standard of Care: Marfan Syndrome|publisher= Brigham and Womans Hospital|url=http://www.brighamandwomens.org/RehabilitationServices/Physical%20Therapy%20Standards%20of%20Care%20and%20Protocols/General%20-%20Marfan%20Syndrome.pdf|year=2008}}</ref>

Adaptive and compensatory strategies are also employed to help facilitate individuals to returning daily activities.

====Self-care====
Disability caused by scoliosis, as well as physical limitations during recovery from treatment-related surgery, often affects an individual’s ability to perform [[self care|self-care]] activities.<ref name="upper extremity">{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1097/00007632-200201010-00016 |author= Burd TA, Pawelek L, Lenke LG. |title= Upper Extremity Functional Assessment After Anterior Spinal Fusion via Thoracotomy for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: Prospective Study of Twenty-Five Patients|journal= Spine|volume=27 |issue=1|pages=65–71 |year=2008 |pmid= 11805638}}</ref> One of the first treatments of scoliosis is the attempt to prevent further curvature of the spine. Depending on the size of the curvature, this is typically done in one of three ways: bracing, surgery, or postural positioning through customized cushioning.<ref name="upper extremity"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author= Voda S. |title= Dangerous Curves: Treating adult idiopathic scoliosis|journal= Nursing|volume=39 |issue=12|pages= 42–6 |year=2009 |pmid= 19934743 |doi= 10.1097/01.NURSE.0000365025.40773.4c |doi_brokendate= 12 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author= Weiss H.F. |title= Rehabilitation of adolescent patients with scoliosis – What do we know? A review of the literature|journal= Pediatric Rehabilitation|volume=6 |issue=3|pages= 183–194 |year=2003}}</ref> Stopping the progression of the scoliosis can prevent the loss of function in many [[activities of daily living]] by maintaining range of motion, preventing deformity of the rib cage, and reducing pain during activities such as bending or lifting.

Occupational therapists are often involved in the process of selection and fabrication of customized cushions. These individualized postural supports are used to maintain the current spinal curvature, or they can be adjusted to assist in the correction of the curvature. This type of treatment can help to maintain mobility for a wheelchair user by preventing the deformity of the rib cage and maintaining an active range of motion in the arms.<ref name="upper extremity"/>

For other self-care activities (such as dressing, bathing, grooming, personal hygiene, and feeding), several strategies can be used as a part of occupational therapy treatment. Environmental adaptations for bathing could include a bath bench, grab bars installed in the shower area, or a handheld shower nozzle.<ref name="Radomski">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hczaxaAXCDsC&pg=PA964|page=964 |last= Radomski |first= M.V.|title= Occupational therapy for physical dysfunction sixth edition.|publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-6312-7}}</ref>  For activities such as dressing and grooming, various assistive devices and strategies can be used to promote independence. An occupational therapist may recommend a long-handled reacher that can be used to assist self-dressing by allowing a person to avoid painful movements such as bending over; a long-handled shoehorn can be used for putting on and removing shoes. Problems with activities such as cutting meat and eating can be addressed by using specialized cutlery, kitchen utensils, or dishes.

====Productivity====
Productive activities include paid or unpaid work, household chores, school, work, and play.<ref name="Rigby">{{Cite book|last= Rigby |first= P.J. |title= Assistive technology for persons with physical disabilities: Evaluation and outcomes Thesis, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.|publisher= University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-393-5041-6}}</ref> Recent studies in healthcare have led to the development of a variety of treatments to assist in the management of scoliosis thereby maximizing productivity for people of all ages. [[Assistive technology]] has undergone dramatic changes over the past 20 years; the availability and quality of the technology has improved greatly.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Salter K, Jutai J, Teasell R, Foley NC, Bitensky J, Bayley M. |title= Issues for selection of outcome measures in stroke rehabilitation: ICF activity|journal= Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=27 |issue=6|pages= 315–340 |year=2010 |pmid= 16040533 |doi= 10.1080/09638280400008545}}</ref> As a result of using assistive technology, functional changes may range from improvements in abilities, performance in daily activities, participation levels, and quality of life.<ref name="Rigby"/>

A common assistive technology intervention is specialized seating and postural control. For children with poor postural control, a comfortable seating system that provides them with the support needed to maintain a sitting position can be essential for raising their overall level of well-being.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Telfer‌ S., Solomonidis S., Spence W. |title= An investigation of teaching staff members' and parents' views on the current state of adaptive seating technology and provision|journal= Disability & Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology|volume=5 |issue=1|pages= 14–24 |year=2009|pmid=19941437 |doi= 10.3109/17483100903191334}}</ref> A child's well-being in a productive sense involves the ability to participate in classroom and play activities.<ref name="Rigby"/> Specialized wheelchair seating has been identified as the most common prescription in the management of scoliosis in teenagers with [[muscular dystrophy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1080/17483100802543114 |author= Richardson M & Frank A.O. |title= Electric powered wheelchairs for those with muscular dystrophy: problems of posture, pain and deformity|journal= Disability & Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology|volume=4 |issue=3|pages= 181–188 |year=2009}}</ref>

With comfortable wheelchair seating, teenagers are able to participate in classroom activities for longer periods with less fatigue. By tilting the seating position 20° forward (toward the thighs), seating pressure is significantly redistributed, so sitting is more comfortable. If an office worker with scoliosis can sit for longer periods, increased work output is likely to occur and could improve quality of life. Tall, forward-sloping seats or front parts of seats, and when possible with tall desk with the opposite slope, can, in general, reduce pains and the need of bending significantly while working or studying, and that is particularly important with braced, fragile, or tender backs. An open hip angle can benefit the used lung volume and respiration.<ref name="Mandal A C Balanced Sitting Posture on Forward Sloping Seat">[http://www.acmandal.com Mandal A C 1996: Balanced Sitting Posture on Forward Sloping Seat]</ref><ref name="Mandal T Better furniture types for work and studies reduces bending and pain">[http://www.bodyconsciousdesign.com/uploads/mandal_article.pdf Mandal T 2009: Better furniture types for work and studies reduces bending and pain. Association for Body Conscious Design]</ref>

For those not using a wheelchair, bracing may be used to treat scoliosis. Lifestyle changes are made to compensate for the proper use of spine braces.

====Leisure====
Many physical symptoms can prevent a person from engaging in physical leisurely activities, such as chest pains, back pains, shortness of breath, and limited spinal movement. The occupational therapist's role is to help individuals with scoliosis manage these physical symptoms so they can participate in physical leisure activities.

Bracing is a common strategy recommended by an occupational therapist, in particular, for individuals engaging in sports and exercise.<ref name="Journal of Chiro"/> An OT is responsible for educating an individual on the advantages and disadvantages of different braces, proper ways to wear the brace, and the day-to-day care of the brace.

To help a person manage heart and lung symptoms, such as shortness of breath or chest pains, an occupational therapist can teach the individual energy conservation techniques.<ref name="Radomski"/> This includes scheduling routine breaks during the activity, as suitable for the individual. For example, an occupational therapist can recommend that a swimmer take breaks between laps to conserve energy. <!--Other energy conservation strategies knowing the benefits of scheduled rest and efficient breathing techniques.<ref name="Radomski"/>--> Adapting or modifying the exercise or sport is another way a person with scoliosis can do it.<ref name="Radomski"/> Adapting the activity may change the difficulty of the sport or exercise. For example, it might mean taking breaks throughout an exercise. If a person with scoliosis is unable to participate in a sport or exercise, an OT can help the individual explore other physical activities that are suitable to his/her interests and capabilities. An occupational therapist and the person with scoliosis can explore enjoyable and meaningful participation in the sport/exercise in another capacity, such as coaching or refereeing.

===Bracing===
Bracing is normally done when the patient has bone growth remaining and is, in general, implemented to hold the curve and prevent it from progressing to the point where surgery is recommended. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the patient with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck. The most commonly used brace is a [[TLSO]], a [[corset]]-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic. It is sometimes worn 22–23 hours a day, depending on the doctor's prescription, and applies pressure on the curves in the spine. The effectiveness of the brace depends not only on brace design and [[orthotist]] skill but on patient compliance and amount of wear per day.
The typical use of braces is for idiopathic curves that are not grave enough to warrant surgery, but they may also be used to prevent the progression of more severe curves in young children, to buy the child time to grow before performing surgery, which would prevent further growth in the part of the spine affected.

==Bracing ==

Bracing may cause emotional and physical discomfort. Physical activity may become more difficult because the brace presses against the stomach, making it difficult to breathe. Children may lose weight from the brace, due to increased pressure on the abdominal area.

The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, [[Risser sign]] 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.<ref name="Herring JA 2002"/>

Progressive scolioses exceeding 25°Cobb in the pubertal growth spurt should be treated with a pattern-specific brace like the Chêneau brace and its derivatives, with an average brace-wearing time of 16 hours/day (23 hours/day assures the best possible result).

The latest standard of brace construction is with CAD/CAM technology. With the help of this technology, it has been possible to standardize the pattern-specific brace treatment. Severe mistakes in brace construction are largely ruled out with the help of these systems. This technology also eliminates the need to make a plaster cast for brace construction. The measurements can be taken any place and is simple (and not comparable to plastering). In Germany, available CAD/CAM braces are known such as the Regnier-Chêneau brace, the Rigo-System-Chêneau-brace (RSC brace), and the Gensingen brace.<ref name="ReferenceA">Weiss HR: ''Best Practice in conservative scoliosis care''.

Complete correction may be obtained for curves less than 50° if the treatment ends before the second year of life.<ref>Derotational casting for progressive infantile scoliosis, Sanders JO, D’Astous J, Fitzgerald M, Khoury JG, Kishan S, Sturm PF, J Pediatr Orthop. 2009 Sep;29(6):581-7.</ref><ref>Casting and Traction Treatment Methods for Scoliosis, Jacques L.

===Surgery===
{{Double image|right|Wiki pre-op.jpg|190|Wiki post-op.jpg|150|Preoperative (left) and postoperative (right) [[X-ray]] of a person with [[thoracic vertebrae|thoracic]] dextroscoliosis and [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]] levoscoliosis: The X-ray is usually projected such that the right side of the subject is on the right side of the image; i.e., the subject is viewed from the rear (see left image; the right image is seen from the front). This projection is typically used by spine surgeons, as it is how [[orthopedic surgeon|surgeon]]s see their patients when they are on the operating table (in the prone position). This is the opposite of conventional chest X-ray, where the image is projected as if looking at the patient from the front. The surgery was a fusion and instrumentation.}}

Surgery is usually recommended by orthopedists for curves with a high likelihood of progression (i.e., greater than 45 to 50° of magnitude), curves that would be cosmetically unacceptable as an adult, curves in patients with [[spina bifida]] and [[cerebral palsy]] that interfere with sitting and care, and curves that affect physiological functions such as breathing.

Surgery for scoliosis is performed by a [[surgeon]] specializing in spine surgery. For various reasons, it is usually impossible to completely straighten a scoliotic spine, but in most cases, significant corrections are achieved.

The two main types of surgery are:
*'''Anterior fusion:''' This surgical approach is through an incision at the side of the chest wall.
*'''Posterior fusion:''' This surgical approach is through an incision on the back and involves the use of metal instrumentation to correct the curve.

One or both of these surgical procedures may be needed. The surgery may be done in one or two stages and, on average, takes four to eight hours.

====Spinal fusion with instrumentation====
[[Spinal fusion]] is the most widely performed surgery for scoliosis. In this procedure, bone [either harvested from elsewhere in the body ([[autograft]]) or from a donor ([[allograft]])] is [[Bone grafting|grafted]] to the vertebrae so when they heal, they form one solid bone mass and the [[vertebral column]] becomes rigid. This prevents worsening of the curve, at the expense of some spinal movement. This can be performed from the anterior (front) aspect of the spine by entering the [[Thoracic cavity|thoracic]] or [[abdominal cavity|abdominal]] cavities, or more commonly, performed from the back (posterior). A combination is used in more severe cases.

Spinal fusions were once performed without metal implants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In this technique, a [[Orthopedic cast|cast]] was applied after the surgery, usually under [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]], to pull the curve as straight as possible, and then hold it there while fusion took place.  Casting left patients largely immobilized for a period of weeks to months, with significant burden on patient quality of life. Additionally, the risk of [[pseudarthrosis]] (fusion failure) at one or more levels was relatively high, and significant correction could not always be achieved.

In 1962, [[Paul Randall Harrington|Paul Harrington]] introduced a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine, as well as holding it rigid while fusion took place. The original (now obsolete) [[Harrington rod]] operated on a ratchet system, attached by hooks to the spine at the top and bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract, or straighten, the curve. The Harrington rod represented a major advance in the field, as it obviated the need for prolonged casting, allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery. Additionally, as the first system to apply instrumentation directly to the spine, the Harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems. A major shortcoming of the Harrington method was it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis, and it did not address rotational deformity. As a result, unfused parts of the spine would try to compensate for this in the effort to stand up straight. As the person aged, there would be increased wear and tear, early-onset arthritis, disc degeneration, muscular stiffness, and pain with eventual reliance on painkillers, further surgery, inability to work full-time, and disability. [http://www.iscoliosis.com/symptoms-flat.html "Flatback"] became the medical name for a related complication, especially for those who had lumbar scoliosis.<ref name="news-medical1">[http://www.news-medical.net/health/Scoliosis-Surgery.aspx Scoliosis Surgery]. News-medical.net. Retrieved on 2011-01-16.</ref>

Modern spinal systems are attempting to address [[sagittal]] imbalance and rotational defects unresolved by the Harrington rod system. They involve a combination of rods, screws, hooks, and wires fixing the spine, and can apply stronger, safer forces to the spine than the Harrington rod. This technique, the [[Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation]], is currently the most common technique for the procedure.

In general, modern spinal fusions have good outcomes with high degrees of correction and low rates of failure and infection. Patients with fused spines and permanent implants tend to have normal lives with unrestricted activities when they are younger; it remains to be seen whether those that have been treated with the newer surgical techniques develop problems as they age.<ref>[http://www.cornellneurosurgery.org/pedneuro/scoliosis.html Weill Cornell Neurological Surgery – Surgical Services].

Pedicle screw-only [[spinal fusion|posterior spinal fusion]] may improve major curve correction at two years among patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) as compared to hybrid instrumentation (proximal hooks with distal pedicle screws) (65% versus 46%) according to a [[cohort study|retrospective, matched-cohort study]].<ref name="pmid16449901">{{Cite journal|author=Kim YJ |title=Comparative analysis of pedicle screw versus hybrid instrumentation in posterior spinal fusion of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis |journal=Spine |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=291–298 |year=2006 |pmid=16449901 |doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000197865.20803.d4|author-separator=,|author2=Lenke LG|author3=Kim J|display-authors=3|last4=Bridwell|first4=Keith H.|last5=Cho|first5=Samuel K.|last6=Cheh|first6=Gene|last7=Sides|first7=Brenda}}</ref> The prospective cohorts were matched to the retrospective cohorts according to patient age, fusion levels, Lenke curve type, and operative method. The two groups were not significantly different in regard to age, Lenke AIS curve type, or Riser grade. The numbers of fused vertebrae were significantly different (11.7±1.6 for pedicle screw versus 13.0±1.2 for hybrid group). This study's results may be biased due to the pedicle screw group's being analyzed prospectively versus retrospective analysis of the hybrid instrumentation group.

====Thoracoplasty====
A complementary surgical procedure a surgeon may recommend is called thoracoplasty (also called costoplasty). This is a procedure to reduce the rib hump that affects most scoliosis patients with a thoracic curve. A rib hump is evidence of some rotational deformity to the spine. Thoracoplasty may also be performed to obtain bone grafts from the ribs instead of the pelvis, regardless of whether a rib hump is present. Thoracoplasty can be performed as part of a spinal fusion or as a separate surgery, entirely.

Thoracoplasty is the removal (or resection) of typically four to six segments of adjacent ribs that protrude. Each segment is one to two inches long. The surgeon decides which ribs to resect based on either their prominence or their likelihood to be realigned by correction of the curvature alone. The ribs grow back straight.

Thoracoplasty has risks, such as increased pain in the rib area during recovery or reduced pulmonary function (10–15% is typical) following surgery. This impairment can last anywhere from a few months to two years. Because thoracoplasty may lengthen the duration of surgery, patients may also lose more blood or develop complications from the prolonged anesthesia. A more significant, though far less common, risk is the surgeon might inadvertently puncture the pleura, a protective coating over the lungs. This could cause blood or air to drain into the chest cavity, haemothorax or pneumothorax, respectively.<ref name="CurvedSpine website">[http://www.curvedspine.com/thoracoplasty.htm CurvedSpine.com Web site.

====Complications====
The risk of undergoing surgery for scoliosis is estimated to be 5%. Possible complications may be inflammation of the soft tissue or deep inflammatory processes, breathing impairments, bleeding and nerve injuries. However, according to the latest evidence, the rate of complications is far higher. As early as five years after surgery, another 5% require reoperation, and today it is not yet clear what to expect from spine surgery in the long term.<ref name="Hawes2006">{{Cite journal|author=Hawes M |title=Impact of spine surgery on signs and symptoms of spinal deformity |journal=Pediatric Rehabilitation |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=318–39 |year=2006 |pmid=17111548}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Weiss HR, Goodall D |title=Rate of complications in scoliosis surgery – a systematic review of the Pub Med literature |journal=Scoliosis |volume=3 |page=9 |year=2008 |pmid=18681956 |pmc=2525632 |doi=10.1186/1748-7161-3-9}}</ref> Taking into account that signs and symptoms of spinal deformity cannot be changed by surgical intervention, surgery remains primarily a cosmetic indication{{dubious|date=January 2011}}, only especially in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the most common form of scoliosis never exceeding 80°.<ref name="Hawes2006"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hawes MC, O'Brien JP |title=A century of spine surgery: what can patients expect? |journal=Disability and Rehabilitation |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=808–817 |year=2008 |pmid=18432439 |doi=10.1080/09638280801889972}}</ref> However, the cosmetic effects of surgery are not necessarily stable.<ref name="Hawes2006"/>

If one decides to undergo surgery, a specialized center should be preferred.

====Surgery without fusion====
New implants that aim to delay spinal fusion and to allow more spinal growth in young children have been developed. For the youngest patients, whose thoracic insufficiency compromises their ability to breathe and applies significant cardiac pressure, ribcage implants that push the ribs apart on the concave side of the curve may be especially useful. These vertical, expandable prosthetic titanium ribs provide the benefit of expanding the thoracic cavity and straightening the spine in all three dimensions while allowing it to grow.

An expandable rod, called a growing rod, may be surgically implanted across the segment of spinal curvature, and lengthened, under surgery, every six months to mimic and maintain normal spine growth. This intervention can halt the progress of curvature and gradually straighten the spine. A magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) system has been developed and is undergoing clinical trials in Hong Kong. This intervention employs a rod that may be expanded by applying strong magnets to the outside of the patient's body, and so does not involve repeated surgeries. The recently published report on the first two children to reach 24 month follow-up (aged 5 and 12 years) is encouraging. Monthly rod lengthening produced a progressive increase in spinal length and correction of scoliosis was maintained.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cheung KM, Cheung JP, Samartzis D, ''et al.'' |title=Magnetically controlled growing rods for severe spinal curvature in young children: a prospective case series |journal=Lancet |volume=379 |issue=9830 |pages=1967–74 |year=2012 |month=May |pmid=22520264 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60112-3 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith JT, Campbell RM |title=Magnetically controlled growing rods for spinal deformity |journal=Lancet |volume=379 |issue=9830 |pages=1930–1 |year=2012 |month=May |pmid=22520263 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60528-5 |url=}}</ref>

Although these methods are novel and promising, they are suitable only for growing patients. Spinal fusion remains the "gold standard" of surgical treatment for scoliosis.<ref name="news-medical1"/>

==Prognosis==
A 50-year follow-up study published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (2003) asserted the lifelong physical health, including cardiopulmonary and neurological functions, and mental health of idiopathic scoliosis patients are comparable to those of the general population. Scoliosis that interferes with normal systemic functions is "exceptional"<ref>Health and Function of Patients With Untreated Idiopathic Scoliosis—Reply [http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/289/20/2644.2.extract]</ref> and "rare", and "untreated [scoliosis] patients had similar death rates and were just as functional and likely to lead productive lives 50 years after diagnosis as people with normal spines".<ref name="jama.ama-assn.org"/><ref>[http://www.stopgettingsick.com/templates/news_template.cfm/6427 Many With Scoliosis Can Skip Treatments]</ref> In an earlier University of Iowa follow-up study, 91 percent of idiopathic scoliosis patients displayed normal pulmonary function, and their life expectancy was 2% longer than that of the general population.<ref name="jbjs.org"/>

Generally, the prognosis of scoliosis depends on the likelihood of progression. The general rules of progression are larger curves carry a higher risk of progression than smaller curves, and thoracic and double primary curves carry a higher risk of progression than single lumbar or thoracolumbar curves. In addition, patients not having yet reached skeletal maturity have a higher likelihood of progression (i.e., if the patient has not yet completed the adolescent growth spurt). Females have a greater risk of progression, as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

As scoliosis is not discussed or even accepted as a disease in adults in some countries, the ability for patients and families to have access to any treatment or advise is sometimes limited. This deformation prone growth problem is used by Insurance companies to strongly focus on patients own responsibility which focuses on the importance of early interaction. 
eg: In Germany it is a mandatory task for schools to team up with orthopaedics and/or family doctors during school consultations to check for growth problems in classrooms.
