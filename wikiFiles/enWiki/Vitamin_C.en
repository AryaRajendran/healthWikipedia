'''Vitamin C''' or '''<small>L</small>-ascorbic acid''', or simply '''ascorbate''' (the [[anion]] of [[ascorbic acid]]), is an [[essential nutrient]] for [[human]]s and certain other animal species. Vitamin C refers to a number of [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body when either of these is introduced into cells, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]].

Vitamin C is a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in at least eight [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions including several [[collagen]] synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name="UKFSA Risk"/> In animals, these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries. Ascorbate may also act as an [[antioxidant]] against [[oxidative stress]].<ref name="Padayatty">{{cite journal | author = Padayatty SJ, Katz A, Wang Y, Eck P, Kwon O, Lee JH, Chen S, Corpe C, Dutta A, Dutta SK, Levine M | title = Vitamin C as an antioxidant: evaluation of its role in disease prevention | journal = J Am Coll Nutr | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–35 | year = 2003 | month = February | pmid = 12569111 | doi = | url = http://www.jacn.org/cgi/content/full/22/1/18 }}</ref> However, the fact that the [[enantiomer]] '''<small>D</small>'''-ascorbate (not found in nature) has identical antioxidant activity to '''<small>L</small>'''-ascorbate, yet far less vitamin activity,<ref name="Aboul-Enein_1999">{{cite journal | author = Aboul-Enein HY, Al-Duraibi IA, Stefan RI, Radoi C, Avramescu A | title = Analysis of L- and D-ascorbic acid in fruits and fruit drinks by HPLC | journal =Seminars in Food Analysis | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–37 | year = 1999 | month = | pmid = | doi = | url = http://ipac.kacst.edu.sa/eDoc/eBook/3761.pdf  }}</ref> underscores the fact that most of the function of '''<small>L</small>'''-ascorbate as a vitamin relies not on its antioxidant properties, but upon enzymic reactions that are [[stereospecific]]. "Ascorbate" without the letter for the enantiomeric form is always presumed to be the chemical '''<small>L</small>'''-ascorbate. 

Ascorbate (the anion of ascorbic acid) is required for a range of essential [[metabolism|metabolic reactions]] in all animals and plants. It is [[biosynthesis|made internally]] by almost all organisms; the main exceptions are [[bat]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, [[capybara]]s, and the Anthropoidea (i.e., [[Haplorrhini]], one of the two major [[primate]] suborders, consisting of [[tarsier]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[human]]s and other [[ape]]s). Ascorbate is also not synthesized by some species of birds and fish. All species that do not synthesize ascorbate require it in the diet. Deficiency in this [[vitamin]] causes the disease [[scurvy]] in humans.<ref name="UKFSA Risk">{{cite web|url=http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/vitaminsandminerals/vitaminc/ | title = Vitamin C | accessdate=2007-02-19 | publisher = Food Standards Agency (UK) }}</ref><ref name=UMM>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article//002404.htm |title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2008-03-31 |month=January | year=2007 |author= |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center }}</ref><ref name=OSU>{{cite web | url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminC/ | title = Vitamin C | accessdate = 2007-03-07 | date = 2006-01-31 | publisher = Oregon State University, Micronutrient Information Center | author = Higdon J }}</ref>

{{anchor|Enantiomeric notation of vitamin C vitamers and their biological significance}}
{{further2|[[ascorbic acid]]}}
The name ''vitamin C'' always refers to the [[Enantiomer|'''<small>L</small>'''-enantiomer]] of ascorbic acid and its [[Redox|oxidized]] forms. The opposite [[Enantiomer|'''<small>D</small>'''-enantiomer]] called '''<small>D</small>'''-ascorbate has equal antioxidant power, but is not found in nature, and has no physiological significance. When '''<small>D</small>'''-ascorbate is synthesized and given to animals that require vitamin C in the diet, it has been found to have far less vitamin activity than the [[Enantiomer|'''<small>L</small>'''-enantiomer]].<ref name="Aboul-Enein_1999"/> Therefore, unless written otherwise, "ascorbate" and "ascorbic acid" refer in the nutritional literature to '''<small>L</small>'''-ascorbate and '''<small>L</small>'''-ascorbic acid respectively. This notation will be followed in this article. Similarly, their oxidized derivatives (dehydroascorbate, etc., see below) are all [[Enantiomer|'''<small>L</small>'''-enantiomer]]s, and also need not be written with full sterochemical notation here. 

Ascorbic acid is a [[weak acid|weak]] [[sugar acid]] structurally related to [[glucose]]. In biological systems, ascorbic acid can be found only at low [[pH]], but in neutral solutions above pH 5 is predominantly found in the [[ionized]] form, [[ascorbate]]. All of these molecules have vitamin C activity, therefore, and are used synonymously with vitamin C, unless otherwise specified.

== Biological significance ==

The biological role of ascorbate is to act as a [[reducing agent]], donating electrons to various enzymatic and a few non-enzymatic reactions. The one- and two-electron oxidized forms of vitamin C, semidehydroascorbic acid and [[dehydroascorbic acid]], respectively, can be reduced in the body by glutathione and NADPH-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name="pmid8144521">{{cite journal | author = Meister A | title = Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals | journal = J.

=== Biosynthesis ===

[[Image:Ascorbic-acid-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|Model of a vitamin C [[molecule]]. Black is [[carbon]], red is [[oxygen]], and white is [[hydrogen]]]]
The vast majority of animals and plants are able to synthesize vitamin C, through a sequence of [[enzyme]]-driven steps, which convert [[monosaccharides]] to vitamin C. In plants, this is accomplished through the conversion of [[mannose]] or [[galactose]] to ascorbic acid.<ref name="pmid9620799">{{cite journal | author = Wheeler GL, Jones MA, Smirnoff N | title = The biosynthetic pathway of vitamin C in higher plants | journal = Nature | volume = 393 | issue = 6683 | pages = 365–9 | year = 1998 | month = May | pmid = 9620799 | doi = 10.1038/30728 }}</ref> In some animals, [[glucose]] needed to produce ascorbate in the liver (in [[mammal]]s and [[Passerine|perching bird]]s) is extracted from [[glycogen]]; ascorbate synthesis is a glycogenolysis-dependent process.<ref name="pmid11458272">{{cite journal | author = Bánhegyi G, Mándl J | title = The hepatic glycogenoreticular system | journal = Pathol.

Among the animals that have lost the ability to synthesise vitamin C are [[simian]]s and [[tarsier]]s, which together make up one of two major [[primate]] suborders, [[Haplorrhini]]. This group includes humans. The other more primitive primates ([[Strepsirrhini]]) have the ability to make vitamin C. Synthesis does not occur in a number of species (perhaps all species) in the small rodent family [[Caviidae]] that includes [[guinea pig]]s and [[capybara]]s, but occurs in other rodents (rats and mice do not need vitamin C in their diet, for example). A number of species of [[passerine]] birds also do not synthesise, but not all of them, and those that don't are not clearly related; there is a theory that the ability was lost separately a number of times in birds.<ref name = "Martinez del Rio_1997">{{cite journal | title = Can passerines synthesize vitamin C? | author = Martinez del Rio C | journal =  The Auk | month = July | year = 1997 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3793/is_199707/ai_n8765385 | accessdate=2 May 2011 | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 513–16 | jstor = 4089257 | doi = 10.2307/4089257 }}</ref> All tested families of bats, including major insect and fruit-eating bat families, cannot synthesise vitamin C.

=== Evolution ===

[[Ascorbic acid]] or vitamin C is a common enzymatic [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in mammals used in the synthesis of [[collagen]]. Ascorbate is a powerful [[reducing agent]] capable of rapidly scavenging a number of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS). Freshwater [[teleost]] fishes also require dietary vitamin C in their diet or they will get scurvy. The most widely recognized symptoms of vitamin C deficiency in fishes are [[scoliosis]], [[lordosis]] and dark skin coloration. Freshwater [[salmonid]]s also show impaired [[collagen]] formation, internal/fin hemorrhage, spinal curvature and increased mortality. If these fishes are housed in seawater with algae and phytoplankton, then vitamin supplementation seems to be less important, it is presumed because of the availability of other, more ancient, antioxidants in natural marine environment.<ref name = "Hardie_1991">{{cite journal | author = Hardie LJ, Fletcher TC, Secombes CJ | title = The effect of dietary vitamin C on the immune response of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 95 | pages = 201–14 | year = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0044-8486(91)90087-N | issue = 3–4 }}</ref>

Some scientists have suggested that loss of the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway may have played a role in rapid evolutionary changes, leading to [[hominid]]s and the emergence of human beings.<ref name="pmid9655531">{{cite journal | author = Challem JJ, Taylor EW | title = Retroviruses, ascorbate, and mutations, in the evolution of Homo sapiens | journal = Free Radic.

It has been noted that the loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbate strikingly parallels the inability to break down [[uric acid]], also a characteristic of primates. Uric acid and ascorbate are both strong [[reducing agent]]s. This has led to the suggestion that, in higher primates, uric acid has taken over some of the functions of ascorbate.<ref name="pmid5477017">{{cite journal | author = Proctor P | title = Similar functions of uric acid and ascorbate in man? | journal = Nature | volume = 228 | issue = 5274 | page = 868 | year = 1970 | month = November | pmid = 5477017 | doi = 10.1038/228868a0 }}</ref>

=== Absorption, transport, and excretion ===

Ascorbic acid is absorbed in the body by both active transport and simple diffusion. Sodium-Dependent Active Transport—Sodium-Ascorbate Co-Transporters (SVCTs) and Hexose transporters (GLUTs)—are the two transporters required for absorption.

Ascorbate concentrations over renal re-absorption threshold pass freely into the urine and are excreted. At high dietary doses (corresponding to several hundred mg/day in humans) ascorbate is accumulated in the body until the plasma levels reach the renal resorption threshold, which is about 1.5&nbsp;mg/dL in men and 1.3&nbsp;mg/dL in women. Concentrations in the plasma larger than this value (thought to represent body saturation) are rapidly excreted in the urine with a half-life of about 30 minutes. Concentrations less than this threshold amount are actively retained by the kidneys, and the excretion half-life for the remainder of the vitamin C store in the body thus increases greatly, with the half-life lengthening as the body stores are depleted. This half-life rises until it is as long as 83 days by the onset of the first symptoms of scurvy.<ref name="pmid8263270">{{cite journal | author = Oreopoulos DG, Lindeman RD, VanderJagt DJ, Tzamaloukas AH, Bhagavan HN, Garry PJ | title = Renal excretion of ascorbic acid: effect of age and sex | journal = J Am Coll Nutr | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 537–42 | year = 1993 | month = October | pmid = 8263270 | doi = }}</ref>

Although the body's maximal store of vitamin C is largely determined by the renal threshold for blood, there are many tissues that maintain vitamin C concentrations far higher than in blood.

Ascorbic acid can be [[oxidized]] (broken down) in the human body by the enzyme [[L-ascorbate oxidase]]. Ascorbate that is not directly excreted in the urine as a result of body saturation or destroyed in other body metabolism is oxidized by this enzyme and removed.

=== Deficiency ===
{{Main|Scurvy}}
[[Scurvy]] is an [[avitaminosis]] resulting from lack of vitamin C, since without this vitamin, the synthesised [[collagen]] is too unstable to perform its function. Scurvy leads to the formation of [[Liver spot|brown spots]] on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from all [[mucous membrane]]s. The spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. In advanced scurvy there are open, [[suppuration|suppurating wounds]] and loss of [[Tooth|teeth]] and, eventually, death. The human body can store only a certain amount of vitamin C,<ref name=MedlinePlus/> and so the body stores are depleted if fresh supplies are not consumed. The time frame for onset of symptoms of scurvy in unstressed adults on a completely vitamin C free diet, however, may range from one month to more than six months, depending on previous loading of vitamin C (see below).

It has been shown that smokers who have diets poor in vitamin C are at a higher risk of lung-borne diseases than those smokers who have higher concentrations of vitamin C in the blood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/901196.stm|title=The influence of smoking on Vitamin C status in adults|accessdate=2007-12-12 |date=2000-09-31|publisher=BBC news and Cambridge University}}</ref>

Nobel prize winners [[Linus Pauling]] and [[G. C. Willis]] have asserted that chronic long term low blood levels of vitamin C ("[[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] scurvy") is a cause of [[atherosclerosis]].<ref name="pmid2147514">{{cite journal | author = Rath M, Pauling L | title = Immunological evidence for the accumulation of lipoprotein(a) in the atherosclerotic lesion of the hypoascorbemic guinea pig | journal = Proc.

Western societies generally consume far more than sufficient Vitamin C to prevent scurvy. In 2004, a Canadian Community health survey reported that Canadians of 19 years and above have intakes of vitamin C from food of 133&nbsp;mg/d for males and 120&nbsp;mg/d for females;<ref name="StatCdn">[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/surveill/nutrition/commun/cchs_guide_escc_3_tab2-eng.php Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2, Nutrition (2004)]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> these are higher than the RDA recommendations.

Notable human dietary studies of experimentally induced scurvy have been conducted on conscientious objectors during WW II in Britain, and on Iowa state prisoners in the late 1960s. These studies both found that all obvious symptoms of scurvy previously induced by an experimental scorbutic diet with extremely low vitamin C content could be completely reversed by additional vitamin C supplementation of only 10&nbsp;mg a day. In these experiments, there was no clinical difference noted between men given 70&nbsp;mg vitamin C per day (which produced blood level of vitamin C of about 0.55&nbsp;mg/dl, about 1/3 of tissue saturation levels), and those given 10&nbsp;mg per day. Men in the prison study developed the first signs of scurvy about 4 weeks after starting the vitamin C free diet, whereas in the British study, six to eight months were required, possibly due to the pre-loading of this group with a 70&nbsp;mg/day supplement for six weeks before the scorbutic diet was fed.<ref name="pmid16510534">{{cite journal | author = Pemberton J | title = Medical experiments carried out in Sheffield on conscientious objectors to military service during the 1939-45 war | journal = Int J Epidemiol | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 556–8 | year = 2006 | month = June | pmid = 16510534 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyl020 }}</ref>

Men in both studies on a diet devoid, or nearly devoid, of vitamin C had blood levels of vitamin C too low to be accurately measured when they developed signs of scurvy, and in the Iowa study, at this time were estimated (by labeled vitamin C dilution) to have a body pool of less than 300&nbsp;mg, with daily turnover of only 2.5&nbsp;mg/day, implying an instantaneous half-life of 83 days by this time (elimination constant of 4 months).<ref name="pmid4977512">{{cite journal | author = Hodges RE, Baker EM, Hood J, Sauberlich HE, March SC | title = Experimental scurvy in man | journal = Am.

Moderately higher blood levels of vitamin C measured in healthy persons have been found to be prospectively correlated with decreased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[ischaemic heart disease]], and an increase life expectancy. The same study found an inverse relationship between blood vitamin C levels and cancer risk in men, but not in women. An increase in blood level of 20 micromol/L of vitamin C (about 0.35&nbsp;mg/dL, and representing a theoretical additional 50&nbsp;grams of fruit and vegetables per day) was found epidemiologically to reduce the all-cause risk of [[mortality rate|mortality]], four years after measuring it, by about 20%.<ref name="pmid11247548">{{cite journal | author = Khaw KT, Bingham S, Welch A, Luben R, Wareham N, Oakes S, Day N | title = Relation between plasma ascorbic acid and mortality in men and women in EPIC-Norfolk prospective study: a prospective population study.

== Role in mammals ==

In humans, vitamin C is essential to a healthy diet as well as being a highly effective [[antioxidant]], acting to lessen [[oxidative stress]]; a substrate for [[ascorbate peroxidase]] in plants (APX is plant specific enzyme);<ref name=OSU/> and an enzyme [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the [[biosynthesis]] of many important biochemicals.

=== Enzymatic cofactor ===

Ascorbic acid performs numerous physiological functions in the human body. These functions include the synthesis of [[collagen]], [[carnitine]], and [[neurotransmitter]]s; the synthesis and [[catabolism]] of [[tyrosine]]; and the metabolism of [[microsome]].<ref name="Gropper_2005"/> During biosynthesis ascorbate acts as a reducing agent, [[electron donor|donating electrons]] and preventing oxidation to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states.

Ascorbic acid behaves not only as an antioxidant but also as a [[pro-oxidant]].<ref name="McGregor_2006"/> Ascorbic acid has been shown to reduce transition metals, such as cupric ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), to cuprous (Cu<sup>1+</sup>), and ferric ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) to ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) during conversion from ascorbate to dehydroascorbate ''[[in vitro]]''.<ref name="pmid9137459">{{cite journal | author = Satoh K, Sakagami H | title = Effect of metal ions on radical intensity and cytotoxic activity of ascorbate | journal = Anticancer Res. | volume = 17 | issue = 2A | pages = 1125–9 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9137459 | doi = }}</ref> This reaction can generate [[superoxide]] and other ROS.

=== Immune system ===

Vitamin C is found in high concentrations in immune cells, and is consumed quickly during infections.  It is not certain how vitamin C interacts with the immune system; it has been hypothesized to modulate the activities of [[phagocyte]]s, the production of [[cytokine]]s and [[lymphocyte]]s, and the number of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s in [[monocyte]]s.<ref name = Preedy>{{cite book |author=Preedy VR, Watson RR, Sherma Z |title=Dietary Components and Immune Function (Nutrition and Health) |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2010 |pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=hxPRdlnn85oC&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false 36]; [http://books.google.com/books?id=hxPRdlnn85oC&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false 52] |isbn=1-60761-060-4 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>

=== Antihistamine ===

Vitamin C is a natural [[antihistamine]]. It both prevents [[histamine]] release and increases the detoxification of histamine.

== Role in plants ==

Ascorbic acid is associated with [[chloroplast]]s and apparently plays a role in ameliorating the oxidative stress of photosynthesis. In addition, it has a number of other roles in cell division and protein modification. Plants appear to be able to make ascorbate by at least one other biochemical route that is different from the major route in animals, although precise details remain unknown.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Smirnoff N | title = BOTANICAL BRIEFING: The Function and Metabolism of Ascorbic Acid in Plants | journal = Annals of Botany | year = 1996 | volume = 78  | issue=6 | pages = 661–9 | doi = 10.1006/anbo.1996.0175 }}</ref>

==Testing for ascorbate levels in the body ==
Simple tests use [[dichlorophenolindophenol]], a [[redox indicator]], to measure the levels of vitamin C in the [[urine]] and in [[serous fluid|serum]] or [[blood plasma]]. However these reflect recent dietary intake rather than the level of vitamin C in body stores.<ref name="UKFSA Risk" /> Reverse phase [[high performance liquid chromatography]] is used for determining the storage levels of vitamin C within [[lymphocyte]]s and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]].
It has been observed that while serum or blood plasma levels follow the [[circadian rhythm]] or short term dietary changes, those within tissues themselves are more stable and give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the organism. However, very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses, and require samples to be analyzed in specialized laboratories.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Emadi-Konjin P, Verjee Z, Levin A, Adeli K | title = Measurement of intracellular vitamin C levels in human lymphocytes by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6TDD-4FMHSY9-2-1&_cdi=5196&_user=308069&_orig=search&_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2005&_sk=999619994&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzz-zSkWW&md5=05a80321d3767c0cdfd386ef7121a781&ie=/sdarticle.pdf

== Adverse effects ==

=== Common side-effects ===

Relatively large doses of ascorbic acid may cause [[indigestion]], particularly when taken on an empty stomach. However, taking vitamin C in the form of [[sodium ascorbate]] and calcium ascorbate may minimize this effect.<ref>Pauling, Linus. (1976). Vitamin C, the Common Cold, and the Flu. San Francisco, CA: W.H. Freeman and Company.</ref> When taken in large doses, ascorbic acid causes [[diarrhea]] in healthy subjects. In one trial in 1936, doses up to 6&nbsp;grams of ascorbic acid were given to 29 infants, 93 children of preschool and school age, and 20 adults for more than 1400 days. With the higher doses, toxic manifestations were observed in five adults and four infants. The signs and symptoms in adults were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing of the face, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. The main toxic reactions in the infants were skin rashes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v05je20.htm |title=Toxicological evaluation of some food additives including anticaking agents, antimicrobials, antioxidants, emulsifiers and thickening agents |accessdate=2007-04-13 |date=4 July 1973 |author= |publisher=World Health Organization }}</ref>

=== Overdose ===

Vitamin C is water soluble, with dietary excesses not absorbed, and excesses in the blood rapidly excreted in the urine. It exhibits remarkably low toxicity. The {{LD50}} (the dose that will kill 50% of a population) in rats is generally accepted to be 11.9&nbsp;grams per kilogram of body weight when given by forced [[gavage]] (orally). The mechanism of death from such doses (1.2% of body weight, or 0.84&nbsp;kg for a 70&nbsp;kg human) is unknown, but may be more mechanical than chemical.<ref name="Oxford">{{cite web|url=http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/AS/ascorbic_acid.html |title=Safety (MSDS) data for ascorbic acid |accessdate= 2007-02-21 |date= 2005-10-09 | publisher= [[Oxford University]] }}</ref> The LD<sub>50</sub> in humans remains unknown, given lack of any accidental or intentional poisoning death data. However, as with all substances tested in this way, the rat LD<sub>50</sub> is taken as a guide to its toxicity in humans.

== Dietary sources ==
[[Image:Rosa rubiginosa hips.jpg|thumb|[[Rose hips]] are a particularly rich source of vitamin C]]
The richest natural sources are fruits and vegetables, and of those, the [[Kakadu plum]] and the [[camu camu]] fruit contain the highest concentration of the vitamin. It is also present in some cuts of meat, especially liver. Vitamin C is the most widely taken [[nutritional supplement]] and is available in a variety of forms, including tablets, [[drink mix]]es, crystals in capsules or naked crystals.

Vitamin C is absorbed by the intestines using a sodium-ion dependent channel. It is transported through the intestine via both glucose-sensitive and glucose-insensitive mechanisms. The presence of large quantities of sugar either in the intestines or in the blood can slow absorption.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wilson JX |title=Regulation of vitamin C transport |journal=Annu. Rev. Nutr. |volume=25 |issue= |pages=105–25 |year=2005 |pmid=16011461 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.050304.092647}}</ref>

=== Plant sources ===

While plants are generally a good source of vitamin C, the amount in foods of plant origin depends on the precise variety of the plant, soil condition, climate where it grew, length of time since it was picked, storage conditions, and method of preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Nutrition/Vitamin_mineral_content_is_stable/forside.htm |title=The vitamin and mineral content is stable |accessdate = 2010-02-26 |publisher=Danish Veterinary and Food Administration}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

=== Food preparation ===

Vitamin C [[chemical decomposition|chemically decomposes]] under certain conditions, many of which may occur during the cooking of food.

Another cause of vitamin C being lost from food is [[leaching (chemical science)|leaching]], where the water-soluble vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed.

=== Supplements ===

[[Image:RedoxonVitaminC.jpg|thumb|right|Vitamin C is widely available in the form of tablets and powders. The [[Redoxon]] brand, launched in 1934 by [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], was the first mass-produced synthetic vitamin C.]]
Vitamin C is available in caplets, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]]s, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin formulations, in multiple antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder. Timed release versions are available, as are formulations containing bioflavonoids such as [[quercetin]], [[hesperidin]], and [[rutin]]. Tablet and capsule sizes range from 25&nbsp;mg to 1500&nbsp;mg. Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) crystals are typically available in bottles containing 300&nbsp;g to 1&nbsp;kg of powder (a 5&nbsp;ml teaspoon of vitamin C crystals equals 5,000&nbsp;mg).  The bottles are usually airtight and brown or [[opaque]] in order to prevent [[oxidation]], in which case the vitamin C would become useless, if not damaging.

=== Industrial synthesis ===

Vitamin C is produced from [[glucose]] by two main routes. The [[Reichstein process]], developed in the 1930s, uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The modern two-step [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] process, originally developed in [[China]] in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose feed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2001/fulltext/456a4.2.pdf |title=The production of vitamin C |accessdate=2007-02-20 |year=2001 |publisher=Competition Commission |format=PDF}}</ref>

Research is underway at the [[Scottish Crop Research Institute]] in the interest of creating a strain of yeast that can synthesise vitamin C in a single fermentation step from [[galactose]], a technology expected to reduce manufacturing costs considerably.<ref name="yeastAA" />

== History ==
[[Image:James lind.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]], a British Royal Navy surgeon who, in 1747, identified that a quality in fruit prevented the disease of scurvy in what was the first [[Scientific_control#Controlled_experiments|recorded controlled experiment]].]]

The need to include fresh plant food or raw animal flesh in the diet to prevent disease was known from ancient times. Native people living in marginal areas incorporated this into their medicinal lore. For example, spruce needles were used in temperate zones in infusions, or the leaves from species of drought-resistant trees in desert areas. In 1536, the French explorers [[Jacques Cartier]] and Daniel Knezevic, exploring the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], used the local natives' knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of the [[Thuja|arbor vitae]] tree to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50&nbsp;mg of vitamin C per 100&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/goweezer/canada/z00cartier3.htm |title=Jacques Cartier's Second Voyage - 1535 - Winter & Scurvy |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref><ref name="pmid12422875">{{cite journal | author = Martini E | title = Jacques Cartier witnesses a treatment for scurvy | journal = Vesalius | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–6 | year = 2002 | month = June | pmid = 12422875 | doi = }}</ref>

Authorities have occasionally recommended the benefit of plant food to promote health and prevent scurvy during long sea voyages. [[John Woodall]], the first appointed surgeon to the [[British East India Company]], recommended the preventive and curative use of [[lemon]] juice in his book, ''The Surgeon's Mate'', in 1617. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer, [[Johann Bachstrom]], in 1734, gave the firm opinion that ''"scurvy is solely owing to a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens, which is alone the primary cause of the disease."''<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Armstrong A | journal = British and foreign medico-chirurgical review: or, Quarterly journal of practical medicine and surgery | title = Observation on Navel Hygiene and Scarvy, more particularly as the later appeared during the Polar Voyage| volume = 22 | pages = 295–305 | year = 1858 | url =http://books.google.com/?id=7VJYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA295 }}</ref> <!--http://books.google.de/books?id=azXx4cbrMZMC&pg=PA74 would also work out-->

While the earliest documented case of [[scurvy]] was described by [[Hippocrates]] around 400 BC, the first attempt to give scientific basis for the cause of this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the British [[Royal Navy]], [[James Lind]]. Scurvy was common among those with poor access to fresh fruit and vegetables, such as remote, isolated [[sailor]]s and [[soldier]]s. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on [[cider]], [[vinegar]], [[sulfuric acid]] or [[seawater]], along with their normal rations. In the [[history of science]], this is considered to be the first occurrence of a [[Experimental control|controlled experiment]]. The results conclusively showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his ''Treatise on the Scurvy''.<ref name="lind_james">{{Cite book|author = Lind J | title = A Treatise of the Scurvy | publisher = A. Millar | location = London | year = 1753 }}</ref>

[[Image:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|left|thumb|[[Citrus|Citrus fruits]] were one of the first sources of vitamin C available to ships' surgeons.]]
Lind's work was slow to be noticed, partly because his ''Treatise'' was not published until six years after his study, and also because he recommended a lemon juice extract known as ''rob''.<ref name=Singh2008>{{Cite book| author = Singh S | authorlink = Simon Singh | coauthors = [[Edzard Ernst]] | title = [[Trick or Treatment|Trick of Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine]] | publisher = WW Norton & Company | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 15–18 | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-393-06661-6 }}</ref> Fresh fruit was very expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage but destroyed the vitamin (especially if boiled in copper kettles).<ref name="Oxford"/> Ship captains concluded wrongly that Lind's other suggestions were ineffective because those juices failed to prevent or cure scurvy.

It was 1795 before the British navy adopted [[lemon]]s or [[lime (fruit)|lime]] as standard issue at sea. Limes were more popular, as they could be found in British West Indian Colonies, unlike lemons, which were not found in [[Dominion|British Dominions]], and were therefore more expensive. This practice led to the American use of the nickname [[Alternative words for British|"limey"]] to refer to the British. [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] had previously demonstrated and proven the principle of the advantages of carrying [[Sauerkraut|"Sour krout"]] on board, by taking his crews to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and beyond without losing any of his men to scurvy.<ref name="isbn0-14-043647-2">{{cite book | author = Beaglehole JH, Cook JD, Edwards PR | title = The journals of Captain Cook | publisher = Penguin | location = Harmondsworth [Eng.] | year = 1999 | pages = | isbn = 0-14-043647-2 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> For this otherwise unheard of feat, the British Admiralty awarded him a medal.

The name ''antiscorbutic'' was used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as general term for those foods known to prevent scurvy, even though there was no understanding of the reason for this. These foods included but were not limited to: lemons, limes, and oranges; sauerkraut, cabbage, [[malt]], and [[portable soup]].<ref name="isbn1-74114-200-8">{{cite book | author = Reeve J, Stevens DA | title = Navy and the Nation: The Influence of the Navy on Modern Australia | publisher = Allen & Unwin Academic | location = | year = 2006 | page = 74 | isbn = 1-74114-200-8 | oclc = | doi = | chapterurl = http://books.google.com/?id=BGs6__kbqKIC&pg=PA74 | chapter = Cook'sVpyages 1768–1780 }}</ref>

Even before the antiscorbutic substance was identified, there were indications that it was present in amounts sufficient to prevent scurvy, in nearly all fresh (uncooked and uncured) foods, including raw animal-derived foods. In 1928, the Arctic anthropologist [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]] attempted to prove his theory of how the [[Eskimo]]s are able to avoid scurvy with almost no plant food in their diet, despite the disease's striking European Arctic explorers living on similar high cooked-meat diets. Stefansson theorised that the natives get their vitamin C from fresh meat that is minimally cooked. Starting in February 1928, for one year he and a colleague lived on an exclusively minimally cooked meat diet while under medical supervision; they remained healthy. Later studies done after vitamin C could be quantified in mostly raw traditional food diets of the [[Yukon]], [[Inuit]], and Métís of the Northern Canada, showed that their daily intake of vitamin C averaged between 52 and 62&nbsp;mg/day, an amount approximately the [[dietary reference intake]] (DRI), even at times of the year when little plant-based food was eaten.<ref name="pmid15173410">{{cite journal | author = Kuhnlein HV, Receveur O, Soueida R, Egeland GM | title = Arctic indigenous peoples experience the nutrition transition with changing dietary patterns and obesity | journal = J.

=== Discovery ===
[[Image:GyorgyiNIH.jpg|thumb|right|[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], pictured here in 1948, was awarded the 1937 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] "for his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion processes, with special reference to vitamin C and the catalysis of fumaric acid".<ref name="pmid19239412">{{cite journal | author = Zetterström R | title = Nobel Prize 1937 to Albert von Szent-Györgyi: identification of vitamin C as the anti-scorbutic factor | journal = Acta Paediatr. | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 915–9 | year = 2009 | month = May | pmid = 19239412 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2009.01239.x }}</ref>]]

In 1907, the needed biological-assay model to isolate and identify the antiscorbutic factor was discovered. [[Axel Holst]] and [[Theodor Frølich]], two [[Norway|Norwegian]] physicians studying shipboard [[beriberi]] in the Norwegian fishing fleet, wanted a small test mammal to substitute for the [[pigeon]]s then used in beriberi research. They fed [[guinea pig]]s their test diet of grains and flour, which had earlier produced beriberi in their pigeons, and were surprised when classic scurvy resulted instead. This was a serendipitous choice of model. Until that time, scurvy had not been observed in any organism apart from humans, and had been considered an exclusively human disease. (Pigeons, as seed-eating birds, were also later found to make their own vitamin C.) Holst and Frølich found they could cure the disease in guinea pigs with the addition of various fresh foods and extracts. This discovery of a clean animal experimental model for scurvy, made even before the essential idea of ''vitamins'' in foods had even been put forward, has been called the single most important piece of vitamin C research.<ref name="pmid12555613">{{cite journal | author = Norum KR, Grav HJ | title = [Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich--pioneers in the combat of scurvy] | language = Norwegian | journal = Tidsskr.

In 1912, the [[Polish American]] biochemist [[Casimir Funk]], while researching beriberi in pigeons, developed the concept of [[vitamin]]s to refer to the non-mineral micronutrients that are essential to health. The name is a blend of "vital", due to the vital biochemical role they play, and "amines" because Funk thought that all these materials were chemical [[amine]]s. Although the "e" was dropped after skepticism that all these compounds were amines, the word [[vitamin]] remained as a generic name for them. One of the ''vitamins'' was thought to be the anti-scorbutic factor in foods discovered by Holst and Frølich. In 1928, this vitamin was referred to as "water-soluble C," although its chemical structure had still not been determined.<ref name="pmid9105273">{{cite journal | author = Rosenfeld L | title = Vitamine--vitamin. The early years of discovery | journal = Clin. Chem. | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 680–5 | year = 1997 | month = April | pmid = 9105273 | doi = }}</ref>

From 1928 to 1932, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] research team of [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] and [[Joseph L. Svirbely]], as well as the [[United States|American]] team led by [[Charles Glen King]] in [[Pittsburgh]], first identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Györgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid (actually, '''<small>L</small>'''-hexuronic acid) from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor, but could not prove it, without a biological assay. At the same time, for five years, King's laboratory at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] had been trying to isolate the antiscorbutic factor in lemon juice, using the original 1907 model of scorbutic guinea pigs, which developed scurvy when not fed fresh foods, but were cured by lemon juice. They had also considered hexuronic acid, but had been put off the trail when a coworker made the explicit (and mistaken) experimental claim that this substance was not the antiscorbutic substance.<ref name="pmid16744896">{{cite journal | author = Svirbely JL, Szent-Györgyi A | title = The chemical nature of vitamin C | journal = Biochem.

Finally, in late 1931, Szent-Györgyi gave Svirbely, formerly of King's lab, the last of his hexuronic acid, with the suggestion that it might be the anti-scorbutic factor. By the spring of 1932, King's laboratory had proven this, but published the result without giving Szent-Györgyi credit for it, leading to a bitter dispute over priority claims (in reality it had taken a team effort by both groups, since Szent-Györgyi was unwilling to do the difficult and messy animal studies).<ref name="pmid16744896"/>

Meanwhile, by 1932, Szent-Györgyi had moved to Hungary and his group had discovered that paprika peppers, a common spice in the Hungarian diet, was a rich source of hexuronic acid, the antiscorbutic factor. With a new and plentiful source of the vitamin, Szent-Györgyi sent a sample to noted British sugar chemist [[Walter Norman Haworth]], who chemically identified it and proved the identification by synthesis in 1933.<ref name="pmid11963399">{{cite journal | author = Juhász-Nagy S | title = [Albert Szent-Györgyi--biography of a free genius] | language = Hungarian | journal = Orv Hetil | volume = 143 | issue = 12 | pages = 611–4 | year = 2002 | month = March | pmid = 11963399 | doi = }}</ref><ref name="pmid4589872">{{cite journal | author = Kenéz J | title = [Eventful life of a scientist. 80th birthday of Nobel prize winner Albert Szent-Györgyi] | language = German | journal = Munch Med Wochenschr | volume = 115 | issue = 51 | pages = 2324–6 | year = 1973 | month = December | pmid = 4589872 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid4612454">{{cite journal | author = Szállási A | title = [2 interesting early articles by Albert Szent-Györgyi] | language = Hungarian | journal = Orv Hetil | volume = 115 | issue = 52 | pages = 3118–9 | year = 1974 | month = December | pmid = 4612454 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed that the substance L-hexuronic acid be called a-scorbic acid, and chemically '''<small>L</small>'''-ascorbic acid, in honor of its activity against scurvy.<ref name="url_NLM_Profiles_Szent-Gyorgyi">{{cite web | url = http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/WG/Views/Exhibit/narrative/szeged.html | title = The Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Papers: Szeged, 1931-1947: Vitamin C, Muscles, and WWII | work = Profiles in Science | publisher = United States National Library of Medicine }}</ref> Ascorbic acid turned out ''not'' to be an amine, nor even to contain any [[nitrogen]].

In part, in recognition of his accomplishment with vitamin C, Szent-Györgyi was awarded the unshared 1937 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/history/1932.html |title=Pitt History - 1932: Charles Glen King |accessdate=2007-02-21|quote=In recognition of this medical breakthrough, some scientists believe that King also deserved Nobel Prize recognition. |publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> [[Norman Haworth|Haworth]] also shared that year's [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], in part for his vitamin C synthetic work.<ref name="pmid19239412"/>

Between 1933 and 1934, not only Haworth and fellow British chemist (later Sir) [[Edmund Hirst]] had synthesized vitamin C, but also, independently, the Polish chemist [[Tadeus Reichstein]], succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin in bulk, making it the first vitamin to be artificially produced.<ref name="pmid356548">{{cite journal | author = Stacey M, Manners DJ | title = Edmund Langley Hirst. 1898-1975 | journal = Adv Carbohydr Chem Biochem | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1–29 | year = 1978 | pmid = 356548 | doi =10.1016/S0065-2318(08)60217-6 | series = Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry | isbn = 9780120072354 }}</ref> The latter process made possible the cheap mass-production of semi-synthetic vitamin C, which was quickly marketed.

In 1957, the American J.J.

In 2008, researchers at the [[University of Montpellier]] discovered that, in humans and other primates, the [[red blood cell]]s have evolved a mechanism to more efficiently utilize the vitamin C present in the body by recycling oxidized L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) back into ascorbic acid, which can be reused by the body. The mechanism was not found to be present in mammals that synthesize their own vitamin C.<ref name=pmid18358815/>
