The '''Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale''' ([[British English|BrE]]) (also known as '''Pediatric Glasgow Coma Score''' ([[American English|AmE]]) or simply '''PGCS''') is the equivalent of the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS) used to assess the mental state of adult patients.  As many of the assessments for an adult patient would not be appropriate for [[infant]]s, the scale was modified slightly.  As with the [[Glasgow Coma Scale|GCS]], the PGCS comprises three tests: [[human eye|eye]], [[Language|verbal]] and [[motoneuron|motor]] responses.  The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible PGCS (the sum) is 3 (deep coma or death) whilst the highest is 15 (fully awake and aware person). The pediatric GCS is commonly used in emergency medical services.

<li value="4">Eyes opening spontaneously</li>
<li value="3">Eye opening to speech</li>
<li value="2">Eye opening to pain</li>
<li value="1">No eye opening or response</li>
</ol>

== Best verbal response: (V) ==
<ol>
<li value="5">Smiles, oriented to sounds, follows objects, interacts.
<li value="4">Cries but consolable, inappropriate interactions.
<li value="3">Inconsistently inconsolable, moaning.

== Best motor responses: (M) ==
<ol>
<li value="6">Infant moves spontaneously or purposefully</li>
<li value="5">Infant withdraws from touch</li>
<li value="4">Infant withdraws from pain</li>
<li value="3">Abnormal flexion to pain for an infant ([[decorticate response]])</li>
<li value="2">Extension to pain ([[decerebrate response]])</li>
<li value="1">No motor response</li>
</ol>

Any combined score of less than eight represents a significant risk of mortality.
