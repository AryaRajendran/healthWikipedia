The '''radius''' or '''radial bone''' is one of the two large [[bone]]s of the [[forearm]], the other being the [[ulna]]. It extends from the [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] side of the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] to the [[thumb]] side of the [[wrist]] and runs parallel to the ulna, which exceeds it in length and size. It is a long bone, [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]-shaped and slightly curved longitudinally. The radius articulates with the capitulum of the [[humerus]], the [[radial notch]] and the head of the ulna. The corresponding bone in the [[human leg|lower leg]] is the [[tibia]].

The word ''radius'' is [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for "ray". In the context of the radius bone, a ray can be thought of rotating around an axis line extending diagonally from center of [[capitulum of the humerus|capitulum]] to the center of distal [[ulna]]. While the [[ulna]] is the major contributor to the elbow joint, the radius primarily contributes to the [[wrist]] joint. <ref>{{ Citation | last1=Marieb | first1=E., R.N., Ph.D | last2=Mallatt | first2=J., Ph.D. | last3=Wilhelm | first3=P., Ph.D. | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Human Anatomy | publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings | place=San Francisco, CA | edition=5th | year=2008 | page=188}}</ref>

The radius is named so because the radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle).  The ulna acts as the center point to the circle because when the arm is rotated the ulna does not move.  The radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle) because it rotates around the ulna and the far end (where it joins to the bones of the hand), known as the styloid process of the radius, is the distance from the ulna (center of the circle) to the edge of the radius (the circle).  

==Shape==
The radius has a body and two extremities. The [[upper extremity of radius|upper extremity of the radius]] consists of a somewhat cylindrical head articulating with the ulna and the humerus, a neck, and a double tuberosity. The [[body of radius|body of the radius]] is self-explanatory, and the [[lower extremity of radius|lower extremity of the radius]] is roughly quadrilateral in shape, with articular surfaces for the [[ulna]], [[scaphoid]] and [[lunate bone]]s. The distal end of the radius forms a palpable point called the [[Radial styloid process|styloid process]]. Along with the [[Proximal radioulnar articulation|proximal]] and [[distal radioulnar articulation]]s, an [[Interosseous membrane of forearm|interosseous membrane]] originates medially along the length of the body of the radius to attach the radius to the ulna.<ref>{{ Citation | last=Clemente | first=Carmine D. | title=Anatomy: A Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | place=Philadelphia, PA | edition=5th | year=2007}}</ref>

===Muscle attachments===
The [[biceps]] muscle inserts on the radial tuberosity of the upper extremity of the bone. The upper third of the body of the bone attaches to the [[supinator muscle|supinator]], the [[flexor digitorum superficialis]], and the [[flexor pollicis longus]] muscles.
The middle third of the body attaches to the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, and the [[pronator teres]] muscles.
The lower quarter of the body attaches to the [[pronator quadratus]] muscle and the [[tendon]] of the supinator longus.

==Structure==
The long narrow [[medullary cavity]] is enclosed in a strong wall of [[compact bone]]. It is thickest along the interosseous border and thinnest at the extremities, save over the cup-shaped articular surface (fovea) of the head.

The [[trabeculae]] of the spongy tissue are somewhat arched at the upper end and pass upward from the compact layer of the shaft to the ''fovea capituli'' (the [[humerus]]'s cup-shaped articulatory notch); they are crossed by others parallel to the surface of the fovea. The arrangement at the lower end is somewhat similar. It is missing in [[radial aplasia]].
==Malformation==
[[Radial aplasia]] refers to the congenital absence of the radius.

==Fracture==
[[File:Pradialheadfrac.png|thumb| A subtle radial head fracture with associated positive sail sign]]
Specific [[bone fracture|fracture]] types of the radius include:
*[[Essex-Lopresti fracture]] - a fracture of the [[Head of radius|radial head]] with concomitant dislocation of the [[Distal radioulnar articulation|distal radio-ulnar joint]] with disruption of the [[Interosseous membrane of the forearm|interosseous membrane]].<ref name="wheeless">[http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/essex_lopresti_fracture Essex Lopresti fracture] at Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics online</ref>
*[[Distal radius fracture]]
**[[Galeazzi fracture]] - a fracture of the radius with dislocation of the [[distal radioulnar joint]]
**[[Colles' fracture]] - a distal fracture of the radius with dorsal (posterior) displacement of the wrist and hand
**[[Smith's fracture]] - a distal fracture of the radius with volar (ventral) displacement of the wrist and hand
**[[Barton's fracture]] - an [[intra-articular fracture]] of the distal radius with dislocation of the [[radiocarpal joint]].

==In other animals==
In four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb. Its structure is similar in most terrestrial tetrapods, but it may be fused with the ulna in some mammals (such as [[horse]]s) and reduced or modified in animals with flippers or vestigial forelimbs.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|page= 199|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
