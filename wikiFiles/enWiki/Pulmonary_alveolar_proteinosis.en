'''Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis''' (abbreviated '''PAP'''), is a rare [[lung disease]] in which abnormal accumulation of [[surfactant]] occurs within the [[alveoli]], interfering with [[gas exchange]].  PAP can occur in a primary form or secondarily in the settings of malignancy (especially in myeloid [[leukemia]]), pulmonary infection, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals.  Rare familial forms have also been recognized, suggesting a [[genetics|genetic]] component in some cases.

==Signs and symptoms==
The [[symptoms]] of PAP include:
*[[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath)<ref name="pmid10607805">{{cite journal |author=Shah PL, Hansell D, Lawson PR, Reid KB, Morgan C |title=Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: clinical aspects and current concepts on pathogenesis |journal=Thorax |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=67–77 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10607805 |pmc=1745595 |doi= 10.1136/thorax.55.1.67|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10607805}}</ref>
*[[cough]]
*low grade [[fever]]
*weight loss

The clinical course of PAP is unpredictable.  Spontaneous remission is recognized; some patients have stable symptoms.  Death may occur due to progression of PAP or due to the underlying disease associated with PAP.  Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to [[pneumonia|infection of the lung]] by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[fungi]].

==Mechanism==
Although the cause of PAP remains obscure, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the etiology of the disease came by the chance observation that mice bred for experimental study to lack a hematologic [[growth factor]] known as [[GM-CSF|granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]] developed a pulmonary [[syndrome]] of abnormal surfactant accumulation resembling human PAP.<ref name="pmid8202532">{{cite journal |author=Stanley E, Lieschke GJ, Grail D, ''et al.'' |title=Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor-deficient mice show no major perturbation of hematopoiesis but develop a characteristic pulmonary pathology |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=5592–6 |year=1994 |month=June |pmid=8202532 |pmc=44042 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.12.5592|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8202532}}</ref>

The implications of this finding are still being explored, but significant progress was reported in February, 2007.  Researchers in that report discussed the presence of anti-[[GM-CSF]] [[autoantibodies]] in patients with PAP, and duplicated that syndrome with the infusion of these [[autoantibodies]] into mice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uchida K, Beck D, Yamamoto T, Berclaz P, Abe S, Staudt M, Carey B, Filippi M, Wert S, Denson L, Puchalski J, Hauck D, Trapnell B |title=GM-CSF autoantibodies and neutrophil dysfunction in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=356 |issue=6 |pages=567–79 |year=2007 |pmid=17287477 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa062505}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Pulmonary_alveolar_proteinosis_-3-_intermed_mag.jpg|thumb|Intermediate magnification [[micrograph]] of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. [[H&E stain]].]]
Chest [[x-ray]]s of affected individuals typically reveal nonspecific alveolar opacities.  [[medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] is generally made by surgical or endoscopic [[biopsy]] of the lung, revealing the distinctive pathologic finding. The current gold standard of PAP [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] involves histopathological examination of alveolar specimens obtained from [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] and transbronchial lung biopsy.<ref name="Hospital Practice 2010">{{cite journal | author= Monisha Das, MD And Gary A. Salzman, MD | title= Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis: An Overview for Internists and Hospital Physicians | journal=Hospital Practice. | month=February | year=2010 | pages=43–49 | pmid= 20469623 | volume=38 | issue=1 | url=http://hosppract.com/index.php?article=277#none | doi=10.3810/hp.2010.02.277}}</ref>

Microscopically, the distal air spaces are filled with a granular, eosinophilic material that is positive with the [[PAS stain]] and the [[PAS diastase stain]].  The main [[histomorphologic]] differential diagnosis is [[pulmonary edema]], which does not have dense bodies.

==Treatment==
The first advance in the treatment of Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis came in November 1960,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramirez-Rivera J, Nyka W, McLaughlin J |title=Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis: Diagnostic Technics and Observations |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=268 |pages=165–71 |year=1963 |doi=10.1056/NEJM196301242680401 |pmid=13990655 |issue=4 }}</ref> when Dr. Jose Ramirez-Rivera at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Baltimore applied repeated "segmental flooding" as a means of physically removing the accumulated alveolar material.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramirez-Rivera J, Schultz RB, Dutton RE |title=Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis: A New Technique and Rational for Treatment |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=112 |pages=173–185 |year=1963 }}</ref>

The standard treatment for PAP is whole-lung [[lavage]],<ref name="pmid17386098">{{cite journal |author=Ceruti M, Rodi G, Stella GM, ''et al.'' |title=Successful whole lung lavage in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis secondary to lysinuric protein intolerance: a case report |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2 |pages=14 |year=2007 |pmid=17386098 |pmc=1845139 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-14 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/2//14}}</ref><ref name="pmid15806528">{{cite journal |author=Menard KJ |title=Whole lung lavage in the treatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis |journal=J. Perianesth. Nurs. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–26 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15806528 |doi= 10.1016/j.jopan.2005.01.005|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1089947205000067}}</ref> in which sterile fluid is instilled into the lung and then removed, along with the abnormal surfactant material.  This is generally effective at ameliorating symptoms, often for prolonged periods.  Since the mouse discovery noted above, the use of GM-CSF injections has also been attempted, with variable success.  Lung [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] can be performed in refractory cases.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is more common in males and in [[tobacco]] smokers.

In a recent epidemiologic study from Japan,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inoue Y, Trapnell BC, Tazawa R,et |title=Characteristics of a Large Cohort of Patients with Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis in Japan |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=177 |issue=7 |pages=752–62 |year=2008 |month=April |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/177/7/752 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200708-1271OC |pmid=18202348 |pmc=2720118}}</ref>  Autoimmune PAP has an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and is not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses.

==History==
PAP was first described in 1958<ref name="pmid12119235">{{cite journal |author=Seymour JF, Presneill JJ |title=Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: progress in the first 44 years |journal=Am. J. Respir.

This [[lipid]] rich material was subsequently recognized to be surfactant.
