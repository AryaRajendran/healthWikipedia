A '''urinalysis''' ('''UA'''), also known as '''routine and microscopy''' ('''R&M'''),  is an array of tests performed on [[urine]], and one of the most common methods of [[medical diagnosis]].<ref name="pmid15791892">{{cite journal |author=Simerville JA, Maxted WC, Pahira JJ |title=Urinalysis: a comprehensive review |journal=American Family Physician |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1153–62 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15791892 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050315/1153.html |accessdate=}}</ref>  The word is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''urine'' and ''analysis''.<ref name=oed>{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Urinalysis|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=urinalysis&allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> 

The target parameters that can be measured or quantified in urinalysis include many substances and cells, as well as other properties, such as [[specific gravity]].

A part of a urinalysis can be performed by using [[urine test strips]], in which the test results can be read as color changes. Another method is [[light microscopy]] of urine samples.

==Target parameters==
In addition to the substances mentioned in tables below, other tests include a description of color and appearance.

A sodium-related parameter is [[fractional sodium excretion]], which is the percentage of the sodium filtered by the kidney which is excreted in the urine. It is a useful parameter in [[acute renal failure]] and [[oliguria]], with a value below 1% indicating a [[prerenal disease]] and a value above 3%<ref name="urlMedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Fractional excretion of sodium">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003602.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Fractional excretion of sodium |work= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> indicating [[acute tubular necrosis]] or other kidney damage.

Since proteins are very large molecules (macromolecules), they are not normally present in measurable amounts in the glomerular filtrate or in the urine. The detection of protein in urine, called [[proteinuria]], may indicate the [[Vascular permeability|permeability]] of the glomerulus is abnormally increased. This may be caused by renal infections or by other diseases that have secondarily affected the kidneys, such as [[hypertension]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[jaundice]], or [[hyperthyroidism]].

|May be present as intact RBCs, which indicate bleeding. Even trace amount of blood is enough to give the entire urine sample a red/pink hue, and it is difficult to judge the amount of bleeding from a gross examination. [[Hematuria]] may be due to a generalized bleeding diathesis or a urinary tract-specific problem (trauma, stone, infection, malignancy, etc.) or artefact of catheterization in case the sample is taken from a collection bag, in which case a fresh urine sample should be sent for a repeat test. 
If the RBCs are of renal or glomerular origin (due to [[glomerulonephritis]]), the RBCs incur mechanical damage during the glomerular passage, and then osmotic damage along the tubules, so get dysmorphic features. The [[dysmorphic]] RBCs in urine which are most characteristic of glomerular origin are called "G1 cells", which are doughnut-shaped rings with protruding round blebs sometimes looking like Mickey Mouse (with ears).

Painless hematuria of nonglomerular origin may be a sign of urinary tract malignancy, which may warrant a more thorough cytological investigation.

If hematuria is followed by artefactual ''ex vivo'' or ''in vitro'' hemolysis in the collected urine, then the dipstick test also will be positive for hemoglobin and will be difficult to interpret. The urine color may also be red due to excretion of reddish pigments or drugs.

| [[Glucose]] || n/a || 0 / negative<ref name=southwest/> || || Glucose can be measured with [[Benedict's test]]. Although glucose is easily filtered in the glomerulus, it is not present in the urine because all of the glucose filtered is normally reabsorbed from the renal tubules back into the blood. Presence of glucose in the urine is called [[glucosuria]].
{{Further|Glucosuria}}
|-
| [[Ketone bodies]] || n/a || 0 / negative<ref name=southwest/> ||  || With [[carbohydrate]] deprivation, such as starvation or high-protein diets, the body relies increasingly on the [[metabolism]] of fats for energy. This pattern is also seen in people with diabetes mellitus, when a lack of the hormone [[insulin]] prevents the body cells from using the large amounts of [[glucose]] available in the blood. This happens because insulin is necessary for the transport of glucose from the blood into the body cells. The metabolism of fat proceeds in a series of steps. First, [[triglycerides]] are [[hydrolyzed]] to fatty acids and [[glycerol]]. Second, the fatty acids are hydrolyzed into smaller intermediate compounds (acetoacetic acid, betahydroxybutyric acid, and acetone). Thirdly, the intermediate products are used in aerobic [[cellular respiration]]. When the production of the intermediate products of fatty acid metabolism (collectively known as ketone bodies) exceeds the ability of the body to metabolize these compounds, they accumulate in the blood and some end up in the urine ([[ketonuria]]).

|-
| [[Bilirubin]] || n/a || 0 / negative<ref name=southwest/> ||  || The fixed phagocytic cells of the spleen and bone marrow destroy old red blood cells and convert the heme groups of hemoglobin to the pigment bilirubin. The bilirubin is secreted into the blood and carried to the liver, where it is bonded to (conjugated with) glucuronic acid, a derivative of glucose. Some of the [[conjugated bilirubin]] is secreted into the blood and the rest is excreted in the bile as bile pigment that passes into the small intestine. The blood normally contains a small amount of free and conjugated bilirubin. An abnormally high level of blood bilirubin may result from an increased rate of red blood cell destruction, liver damage (as in [[hepatitis]] and [[cirrhosis]]), and obstruction of the common bile duct as with gallstones. An increase in blood bilirubin results in jaundice, a condition characterized by a brownish-yellow pigmentation of the skin and of the [[sclera]] of the eyes.

==Methods==
When doctors order a urinalysis, they will request either a routine urinalysis or a [[routine and microscopy]] (R&M) urinalysis, with the difference being a routine urinalysis does not include microscopy or culture.

===Urine test strip===
A [[urine test strip]] can quantify:
*[[white blood cell|Leukocytes]] – with presence in urine known as [[leukocyturia]]
*[[Nitrite]] – with presence in urine known as [[nitrituria]]
*[[Protein]] – with presence in urine known as [[proteinuria]], [[albuminuria]], or [[microalbuminuria]]
*[[red blood cell|Blood]] – with presence in urine known as hematuria]]
*[[Specific gravity (kidney)|specific gravity]]

===Microscopic examination===
[[Image:Urinary phase-contrast microscopy.jpg|right|thumb|A urine sample is about to be examined under a phase-contrast microscope using a Neubauer [[counting chamber]]. The urine is under the cover slide, in the upper segment formed by the H-shaped grooves.]]
The numbers and types of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and/or material such as [[urinary casts]] can yield a great detail of information and may suggest a specific diagnosis.
*[[Hematuria]] – associated with [[kidney stone]]s, [[infection]]s, [[tumor]]s and other conditions
*[[Pyuria]] – associated with [[Urinary tract infection|urinary infections]]
*[[Eosinophiluria]] – associated with [[allergic interstitial nephritis]], [[cholesterol embolism|atheroembolic disease]]
*[[urinary casts#Red blood cell casts|Red blood cell casts]] – associated with [[glomerulonephritis]], [[vasculitis]], or [[malignant hypertension]]
*[[urinary casts#White blood cell casts|White blood cell casts]] – associated with [[acute interstitial nephritis]], exudative [[glomerulonephritis]], or severe [[pyelonephritis]]
*(Heme) granular casts – associated with [[acute tubular necrosis]]
*[[Crystalluria]] – associated with [[acute urate nephropathy]] (or acute uric acid nephropathy, AUAN)
*[[calcium oxalate|Calcium oxalatin]] – associated with [[ethylene glycol]] toxicity

===Other methods of urinalysis===
* Urine culture – a [[microbiological culture]] of urine samples, detecting [[bacteriuria]], is indicated when a [[urinary tract infection]] is suspected.
*Ictotest – this test is used to detect the destruction of old red blood cells in the urine.
*[[Hemoglobin]] test – this tests for [[hemolysis]] in the blood vessels, a rupture in the [[capillaries]] of the [[glomerulus]], or [[hemorrhage]] in the urinary system, which cause [[hemoglobin]] to appear in the urine.
