'''Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'''  ('''ITP'''), also known as primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, is defined as isolated low platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]]) with normal [[bone marrow]] and the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. It causes a characteristic [[purpuric]] rash and an increased tendency to bleeding. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and has a spontaneous resolution within 2 months. Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura persists longer than 6 months without a specific cause.

ITP is an [[autoimmune]] condition with [[antibodies]] detectable against several platelet surface [[antigens]].

ITP is diagnosed by a low platelet count in a [[complete blood count]] (a common [[blood test]]). However, since the diagnosis depends on the exclusion of other causes of a low platelet count, additional investigations (such as a [[bone marrow biopsy]]) may be necessary in some cases. 

In mild cases, only careful observation may be required but very low counts or significant bleeding may prompt treatment with [[glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]], [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[Rho(D) immune globulin|anti-D immunoglobulin]], or immunosuppressive drugs. ''Refractory ITP'' (not responsive to conventional treatment) may require [[splenectomy]], the surgical removal of the spleen. [[Plateletpheresis|Platelet transfusions]] may be used in severe bleeding together with a very low count. Sometimes the body may compensate by making abnormally large platelets.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Petechiaesmall.jpg|thumb|right|Petechiae on the lower extremities.]]Signs include the spontaneous formation of [[purpura|bruises]] (purpura) and [[petechia]]e (tiny bruises), especially on the [[limb (anatomy)|extremities]], [[epistaxis|bleeding from the nostrils]] and/or [[gums]], and [[menorrhagia]] (excessive [[menstruation|menstrual bleeding]]), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per μl.<ref name="pmid15660520">{{cite journal |author=Cines DB, McMillan R |title=Management of adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=56 |issue= |pages=425–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15660520 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104644}}</ref> A very low count (<10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of [[hematoma]]s (blood masses) in the mouth or on other [[mucous membrane]]s. Bleeding time from minor [[laceration]]s or [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] is usually prolonged.

Serious and possibly [[complication (medicine)|fatal complications]] due to extremely low counts (<5,000 per μl) include [[Subarachnoid hemorrhage|subarachnoid]] or [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] (bleeding inside the [[skull]] or [[brain]]), [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]] or other internal bleeding. An ITP patient with an extremely low count is vulnerable to internal bleeding caused by [[abdominal trauma|blunt abdominal trauma]], as might be experienced in a [[motor vehicle collision|motor vehicle crash]]. These complications are not likely when the platelet count is above 20,000 per μl.

==Pathogenesis==
In approximately 60% of  cases, [[antibodies]] against platelets can be detected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coopamah M, Garvey M, Freedman J, Semple J |title=Cellular immune mechanisms in autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura: An update |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69–80 |year=2003 |pmid=12522773 |doi=10.1053/tmrv.2003.50004}}</ref>  Most often these antibodies are against platelet membrane [[glycoprotein]]s [[IIb-IIIa]] or [[Ib-IX]], and are of the [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG) type and some renowned research, the '''[[Harrington–Hollingsworth experiment]]''', established the immune [[pathogenesis]] of ITP.<ref name="pmid18046034">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz RS |title=Immune thrombocytopenic purpura--from agony to agonist |journal=N.

The coating of platelets with IgG renders them susceptible to [[opsonization]] and [[phagocytosis]] by [[spleen|splenic]] [[macrophage]]s, as well by [[Kupffer cell]]s in the [[liver]].&nbsp; The IgG autoantibodies are also thought to damage [[megakaryocyte]]s, the precursor cells to platelets, although this is believed to contribute only slightly to the decrease in platelet numbers.&nbsp; Recent research now indicates that impaired production of the [[glycoprotein]] [[hormone]] [[thrombopoietin]], which is the stimulant for platelet production, may be a contributing factor to the reduction in circulating platelets.&nbsp; This observation has led to the development of a class of ITP-targeted drugs referred to as thrombopoietin [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[agonist]]s.  

The stimulus for auto-antibody production in ITP is probably abnormal [[T cell]] activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Semple JW, Freedman J |title=Increased antiplatelet T helper lymphocyte reactivity in patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia |journal=Blood |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=2619–25 |year=1991 |pmid=1840468 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid18375792">{{cite journal |author=Stasi R, Cooper N, Del Poeta G, ''et al.'' |title=Analysis of regulatory T-cell changes in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura receiving B cell-depleting therapy with rituximab |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=1147–50 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18375792 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-12-129262 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18375792}}</ref><ref name="pmid18420827">{{cite journal |author=Yu J, Heck S, Patel V, ''et al.'' |title=Defective circulating CD25 regulatory T cells in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=1325–8 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18420827 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-01-135335 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18420827 |pmc=2515134}}</ref>&nbsp; Preliminary findings suggest that these T cells can be influenced by drugs that target [[B cell]]s, such as [[rituximab]].<ref name="pmid18463354">{{cite journal |author=Godeau B, Porcher R, Fain O, ''et al.'' |title=Rituximab efficacy and safety in adult splenectomy candidates with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura: results of a prospective multicenter phase 2 study |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=999–1004 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18463354 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-01-131029 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18463354}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ITP is a process of exclusion.&nbsp; First, it has to be determined that there are no blood abnormalities other than a low platelet count, and no physical signs other than bleeding.&nbsp; Then, secondary causes (5&ndash;10 percent of suspected ITP cases) should be excluded.&nbsp; Such secondary causes include [[leukemia]], medications (e.g., [[quinine]], [[heparin]]), [[lupus erythematosus]], [[cirrhosis]], [[HIV]], [[hepatitis]] C, congenital causes, [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[von Willebrand factor]] deficiency, [[onyalai]] and others.<ref name="pmid15660520"/><ref name="pmid15941913"/>&nbsp; In approximately one percent of cases, [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] and ITP coexist, a condition referred to as [[Evans syndrome]].<ref name="pmid15941913"/>

Despite the destruction of platelets by splenic macrophages, the spleen is normally not enlarged.&nbsp; In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia.&nbsp; Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients.&nbsp; However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of Hematology practice guidelines<ref name="pmid9036806">{{cite journal |title=Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: recommendations of the American Society of Hematology.

[[Bone marrow]] [[bone marrow examination|examination]] may be performed on patients over the age of 60 and those who do not respond to treatment, or when the diagnosis is in doubt.<ref name="pmid15941913"/>&nbsp; On examination of the marrow, an increase in the production of megakaryocytes may be observed <!--- there's still disagreement as to whether increased megakaryocyte production is a response to platelet destruction ---> and may help in establishing a diagnosis of ITP.&nbsp; An analysis for anti-platelet antibodies is a matter of clinician's preference, as there is disagreement on whether the 80 percent specificity of this test is sufficient to be clinically useful.<ref name="pmid15941913"/>

==Treatment==
[[File:Oral petechiae.JPG|thumb|Oral petechiae/purpura - lower lip]]
A platelet count below 20,000 per μl is generally an indication for treatment.&nbsp; Counts between 20,000 and 50,000 per μl are usually evaluated on a patient-by-patient basis.  With rare exceptions, there is usually no need to treat with a count above 50,000 per μl.<ref name="pmid15941913"/> [[Hospital]]ization may be recommended in cases of very low counts, and is advisable if significant internal or mucocutaneous bleeding has developed. A count below 10,000 per μl is a potential [[medical emergency]], because of increased vulnerability to subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage in the event of even moderate [[head trauma]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Treatment recommendations sometimes differ for adult and pediatric ITP.<ref name="practice">{{cite journal |author=Neunert C, Lim W, Crowther M, Cohen A, Solberg L, Crowther MA |title=The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia |journal=Blood |volume=117 |issue=16 |pages=4190–207 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21325604 |doi=10.1182/blood-2010-08-302984 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/early/2011/03/16/blood-2010-08-302984.full.pdf+html}}</ref>

===Steroids===
Initial treatment usually consists of the administration of [[glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]], a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count and whether there is active bleeding: in urgent situations, [[Routes_of_administration#Parenteral|infusions]] of [[dexamethasone]] or [[methylprednisolone]] may be used, while oral [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]] may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation.<ref name="pmid15941913"/><ref name="pmid17122451"/> Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential [[Corticosteroid#Side-effects|side-effects]] that include [[osteoporosis]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[cataract]]s.{{citation needed | date=December 2011}}

===Anti-D===
Another option, suitable for [[Rhesus blood group system|Rh-positive]] patients,  is intravenous administration of [[Rho(D) immune globulin]] (Anti-D).&nbsp; Anti-D is normally administered to Rh-negative women during [[pregnancy]] and after the birth of an Rh-positive [[infant]], to prevent sensitization to the Rh factor in the newborn.&nbsp; Anti-D has been demonstrated effective on some ITP patients, but is costly, produces only a short-term improvement, and is not recommended for post-splenectomy patients.<ref>See http://www.winrho.com/isi.html for efficacy and safety data on WinRho anti-D.</ref>

===Steroid-sparing agents===
There is increasing use of [[Immunosuppresant]]s such as [[mycophenolic acid|mycophenolate mofetil]] and [[azathioprine]] because of their effectiveness.&nbsp; In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed, the [[off-label]] use of [[vincristine]], a [[chemotherapy]] agent, may be attempted.&nbsp; However, this [[vinca alkaloid]], has significant [[Vincristine#Side_effects|side-effects]] and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.

[[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIg) may be infused in some cases.&nbsp; However, while sometimes effective, it is costly and produces improvement that generally lasts less than a month.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in the case of an ITP patient already scheduled for [[surgery]] who has a dangerously low platelet count and has experienced a poor response to other treatments, IVIg can increase the count and reduce bleeding risk.

===Thrombopoietin receptor agonists===
[[Thrombopoietin]] receptor agonists are [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]]s that stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow.  In this, they differ from the previously discussed agents that act by attempting to curtail platelet destruction.<ref name="Mayo Clinic">{{cite web|title=Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: Treatments and Drugs|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura/DS00844/DSECTION=treatments%2Dand%2Ddrugs|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> Two such products are currently available:

*[[Eltrombopag]] (trade name Promacta in the USA, Revolade in the EU) is an orally-administered agent with an effect similar to that of romiplostim.&nbsp; It too has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts and decrease bleeding in a dose-dependent manner.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bussel JB, Cheng G, Saleh MN, ''et al.'' |year=2007|title=Eltrombopag for the treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|journal=N.

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the USA will cover most of the cost of romiplostim or eltrombopag treatment under [[Medicare (United_States)#Part A: Hospital insurance|Part-A]].

Side effects of thrombopoietin receptor agonists include headache, joint or muscle pain, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and an increased risk of blood clots.<ref name="Mayo Clinic"/>

===Surgery===
[[Splenectomy]] (removal of the [[spleen]]) may be considered, as platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by [[macrophages]] in the spleen (which have [[Fc receptors]]).&nbsp; The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery.&nbsp; Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 60 to 65 percent of ITP cases, less so in older subjects.<ref>See http://www.itpsupport.org.uk/american/%205.%20Splenectomy%20in%20ITP.pdf, page 2.</ref>&nbsp; As noted in the introduction, the use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.

===Platelet transfusion===
Platelet transfusion alone is normally not recommended except in an emergency, and is usually unsuccessful in producing a long-term platelet count increase.&nbsp; This is because the underlying autoimmune mechanism that is destroying the patient's platelets will also destroy donor platelets.

===''H. pylori'' eradication===
In adults, particularly those living in areas with a high prevalence of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and has been associated with [[peptic ulcer]]s), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Stasi R, Sarpatwari A, Segal JB, Osborn J, Evangelista ML, Cooper N, Provan D, Newland A, Amadori S, Bussel JB | title=Effects of eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a systematic review | journal=Blood | year=2009 | volume=113 | pages=1231–40 | pmid=18945961 | doi=10.1182/blood-2008-07-167155  | url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/113/6/1231.long | issue=6}}</ref> In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas.

== Epidemiology ==
A normal platelet count is considered to be in the range of 150,000&ndash;450,000 per microlitre (μl) of blood for most healthy individuals.&nbsp; Hence one may be considered thrombocytopenic below that range, although the threshold for a diagnosis of ITP is not tied to any specific number.

The incidence of ITP is estimated at 50&ndash;100 new cases per million per year, with children accounting for half of that amount.&nbsp; At least 70 percent of childhood cases will end up in remission within six months, even without treatment.<ref name="pmid15494875">{{cite journal |author=Watts RG |title=Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a 10-year natural history study at the children's hospital of Alabama |journal=Clinical pediatrics |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=691–702 |year=2004 |pmid=15494875|doi=10.1177/000992280404300802}}</ref><ref name="pmid17460024">{{cite journal |author=Treutiger I, Rajantie J, Zeller B, Henter JI, Elinder G, Rosthøj S |title=Does treatment of newly diagnosed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura reduce morbidity? |journal=Arch.

== Special Cases: ITP in Pregnancy ==
Anti-platelet autoantibodies in a pregnant woman with ITP will attack the patient's own platelets and will also cross the placenta and react against fetal platelets.  Therefore, ITP is a significant cause of fetal and neonatal immune thrombocytopenia.  Approximately 10% of newborns affected by ITP will have platelet counts <50,000/uL and 1% to 2% will have a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage comparable to infants with [[neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]] (NAIT). <ref> Roback et al.

Blood 2003; 102; 4306-11.</ref>

No lab test can reliably predict if neonatal thrombocytopenia will occur.  The risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia is increased with<ref> Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology. Chicago: ASCP Press, 2009.</ref>:
* Mothers with a history of splenectomy for ITP
* Mothers who had a previous infant affected with ITP
* Gestational (maternal) platelet count less than 100,000/uL

It is recommended that mothers with thrombocytopenia or a previous diagnosis of ITP should be tested for serum antiplatelet antibodies.  A woman with symptomatic thrombocytopenia and an identifiable antiplatelet antibody should be started on therapy for their ITP which may include steroids or IVIG.  Fetal blood analysis to determine the platelet count is not generally performed as ITP-induced thrombocytopenia in the fetus is generally less severe than NAIT. Platelet transfusions may be performed in newborns, depending on the degree of thrombocytopenia. It is recommended that neonates be followed with serial platelet counts for the first few days after birth.<ref> Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology.

==History==
After initial reports by the Portuguese physician [[Amato Lusitano]] in 1556 and Lazarus de la Rivière (physician to the King of France) in 1658, it was the German physician and poet [[Paul Gottlieb Werlhof]] who in 1735 wrote the most complete initial report of the purpura of ITP. Platelets were unknown at the time.<ref name=Stasi>{{cite journal |author=Stasi R, Newland AC |title=ITP: a historical perspective |journal=Br. J.
