[[Retina]]l [[gene therapy]] holds great promise in treating different forms of non-inherited and inherited [[blindness]].

In 2008, three independent research groups reported that patients with the rare genetic retinal disease [[Leber's Congenital Amaurosis]] had been successfully treated using [[gene therapy]] with [[adeno-associated virus]] (AAV).<ref name="Maguire 2008">{{cite journal | author = Maguire A.

These results were widely seen as a success in the gene therapy field, and have generated excitement and momentum for AAV-mediated applications in retinal disease.

In retinal gene therapy, the most widely used vectors for ocular gene delivery are based on [[adeno-associated virus]]. The great advantage in using adeno-associated virus for the gene therapy is that it poses minimal [[immune response]]s and mediates long-term [[transgene]] expression in a variety of retinal cell types. For example tight junctions that form the blood-retina barrier, separate subretinal space form the [[blood supply]], providing protection from [[microbe]]s and decreasing most immune-mediated damages.<ref name=Stieger>{{cite journal | author = Stieger K, Lhériteau E, Moullier P, Rolling F | year = 2009 | title = AAV-mediated gene therapy for retinal disorders in large animal models | url = | journal = ILAR J | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 206–209 }}</ref>

==Clinical Trials and Early Successes==

===Leber's Congenital Amaurosis===

In 2008, three groups reported positive results of clinical trials using [[adeno-associated virus]] for [[Leber's Congenital Amaurosis]]. In these studies, an AAV vector encoding the [[RPE65]] gene was delivered via a "subretinal injection," where a small amount of fluid is injected underneath the retina in a short surgical procedure.

Initial results from all three studies indicate that AAV is safe in the retina, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. Across the three trials, no serious adverse events were observed.<ref name="Cideciyan 2009">{{cite journal | author = Cideciyan A. V., Hauswirth W. W., Aleman T. S., Kaushal S., Schwartz S.

====UK Trial====
The first gene therapy trial for LCA took place in 2007 at [[Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|Moorfield Eye Hospital]] and [[University College London]]’s Institute of Ophthalmology. The first operation was carried out on a 23 year-old British male, Robert Johnson, in early 2007.[35] In this trial, a relatively large amount of fluid (up to 1 milliliter) was injected underneath the retina. The treatment was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. There was no significant change in visual acuity, peripheral visual fields, or electroretinography. However, one patient had significant improvement in visual function on microperimetry and on dark-adapted perimetry. This patient also showed improvement in a subjective test of visual mobility.

====UPenn Trial====
The UPenn trial was led by a group of four principal investigators at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: Jean E. Bennett, MD PhD, Albert Maguire MD, Katherine High MD, and J. Fraser Wright, PhD. In this trial, patients improved in terms of visual acuity, pupillometry, visual field, light sensitivity, mobility, and functional MRI.<ref name="Maguire 2008" /><ref name="Simonelli 2010" /><ref name="Maguire 2009" /><ref name="Ashtari 2011" /> In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, children as young as 8 years old were treated, and results indicated that younger patients had better results compared to older patients.<ref name="Maguire 2009" />

====Florida Trial====
The Florida trial was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Samuel Jacobson and Dr. William Hauswirth, with funding support from the National Eye Institute. This trial treated adults over the age of 18. The treatment was delivered safely, and was associated with improvements in vision. Unlike the UPenn trial, the injection was not delivered underneath the fovea, but next to it. As patients' vision improved, they had the best vision in the injected area, rather than in the usual place at the fovea. This led to the development of a so-called "pseudo-fovea" that corresponded to the treated area.<ref name="Cideciyan 2009b">{{cite journal | author = Cideciyan A. V., Hauswirth W. W., Aleman T.

===Age-Related Macular Degeneration===
Following the successful clinical trials in LCA, researchers have been developing similar treatments using adeno-associated virus for [[macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD). To date, efforts have focused on long-term delivery of [[VEGF]] inhibitors to treat the wet form of macular degeneration. Whereas wet AMD is currently treated using frequent injections of recombinant protein into the eyeball, these goal of these treatments is long-term disease management following a single administration. One such study is being conducted at the [[Lions Eye Institute]] in Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety and Efficacy Study of rAAV.sFlt-1 in Patients With Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01494805|publisher=U.

===Choroideremia===
In October 2011, the first clinical trial was announced for the treatment of [[choroideremia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=First Patient Treated in Choroideremia Gene Therapy Clinical Trial in U.K.|url=http://www.blindness.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2950:first-patient-treated-in-choroideremia-gene-therapy-clinical-trial-in-uk&catid=68:other-retinal-diseases&Itemid=124|publisher=Foundation Fighting Blindness|accessdate=1 June 2012|date=28 October 2011}}</ref> Dr. Robert MacLaren of the University of Oxford, who is leading the trial, co-developed the treatment with Dr. Miguel Seabra of the Imperial College, London.

==Scientific Foundation and How it Works==

===Important physiological components in retinal gene therapy===
The vertebrate neural retina composed of several layers and distinct cell types (see [[retina#anatomy of the human retina|anatomy of the human retina]]). A number of these cell types are implicated in retinal diseases, including [[retinal ganglion cells]], which degenerate in glaucoma, the rod and cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], which are responsive to light and degenerate in [[retinitis pigmentosa]], [[macular degeneration]], and other retinal diseases, and the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE), which supports the photoreceptors and is also implicated in [[retinitis pigmentosa]] and [[macular degeneration]].

In retinal [[gene therapy]], AAV is capable of "transducing" these various cell types by entering the cells and expressing the therapeutic DNA sequence. Since the cells of the retina are non-dividing, AAV continues to persist and provide expression of the therapeutic DNA sequence over a long time period that can last several years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bennicelli J., Wright J. F., Komaromy A., Jacobs J. B., Hauck B., Zelenaia O., Mingozzi F. ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title = Reversal of Blindness in Animal Models of Leber Congenital Amaurosis Using Optimized AAV2-mediated Gene Transfer | url = | journal = Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 458–465 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mt.6300389 }}</ref>

===AAV Tropism and Routes of Administration in the Eye===
AAV is capable of transducing multiple cell types within the retina. AAV serotype 2, the most well-studied type of AAV, is commonly administered in one of two routes: intravitreal or subretinal. Using the intravitreal route, AAV is injected in the [[vitreous humor]] of the eye. Using the subretinal route, AAV is injected underneath the retina, taking advantage of the potential space between the photoreceptors and RPE layer, in a short surgical procedure. Although this is more invasive than the intravitreal route, the fluid is absorbed by the RPE and the retina flattens in less than 14 hours without complications.<ref name="Maguire 2008" /> Intravitreal AAV targets retinal ganglion cells and a few Muller glial cells. Subretinal AAV efficiently targets photoreceptors and RPE cells.<ref>Auricchio, A., Kobinger, G., Anand, V., Hildinger, M., O'Connor, E., Maguire, A. M., Wilson, J. M., ''et al.'' (2001). Exchange of surface proteins impacts on viral vector cellular specificity and transduction characteristics: the retina as a model Human molecular genetics, 10(26), 3075–3081.</ref><ref name="Lebherz, C. 2008">Lebherz, C., Maguire, A., Tang, W., Bennett, J., & Wilson, J. M. (2008). Novel AAV serotypes for improved ocular gene transfer. The Journal of Gene Medicine, 10(4), 375–382. {{doi|10.1002/jgm.1126}}</ref>

The reason that different routes of administration lead to different cell types being transfected (e.g., different [[tropism]]) is that the  [[inner limiting membrane]] (ILM) and the various retinal layers act as physical barriers for the delivery of drugs and vectors to the deeper retinal layers.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/mt.2009.181 | pmid = | volume=17 | issue=12}}</ref> Thus overall, subretinal AAV is 5-10 times more efficient than delivery using the intravitreal route.

===Tropism Modification and Novel AAV Vectors===
One important factor in [[gene delivery]] is developing altered [[cell tropism]]s to narrow or broaden rAAV-mediated gene delivery and to increase its efficiency in tissues. Specific properties like capsid conformation, cell targeting strategies can determine which cell types are affected and also the efficiency of the [[gene transfer]] process. Different kinds of modification can be undertaken. For example modification by chemical, immunological or genetic changes that enables the AAV2 capsid to interact with specific [[cell surface molecule]]s.<ref name=Gene>Gene Therapy Net [online]. 2010 [cited 30 March 2010]; Available from: URL:http://www.asgct.org</ref>

Initial studies with AAV in the retina have utilized AAV serotype 2. Researchers are now beginning to develop new variants of AAV, based on naturally-occurring AAV serotypes and engineered AAV variants.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/gt.2011.151 | pmid =  }}</ref>

Several naturally-occurring serotypes of AAV have been isolated that can transduce retinal cells. Following intravitreal injection, only AAV serotypes 2 and 8 were capable of transducing retinal ganglion cells. Occasional Muller cells were transduced by AAV serotypes 2, 8, and 9. Following subretinal injection, serotypes 2, 5, 7, and 8 efficiently transduced photoreceptors, and serotypes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 efficiently transduce RPE cells.<ref name="Lebherz, C. 2008"/>

One example of an engineered variant has recently been described that efficiently transduces Muller glia following intravitreal injection, and has been used to rescue an animal model of aggressive, autosomal-dominant [[retinitis pigmentosa]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Klimczak R.

===AAV and Immune Privilege in the Retina===
Importantly, the retina is immune-privileged, and thus does not experience a significant inflammation or immune-response when AAV is injected.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bennett J | year = 2003 | title = Immune response following intraocular delivery of recombinant viral vectors | url = | journal = Gene therapy | volume = 10 | issue = 11| pages = 977–982 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302030 }}</ref> Immune response to gene therapy vectors is what has caused previous attempts at gene therapy to fail, and is considered a key advantage of gene therapy in the eye. Re-administration has been successful in large animals, indicating that no long-lasting immune response is mounted.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Amado D., Mingozzi F., Hui D., Bennicelli J.

''et al.'' | year = 2010 | title = Safety and efficacy of subretinal readministration of a viral vector in large animals to treat congenital blindness | url = | journal = Science translational medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 21| pages = 2–16 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3000659 | pmid = 20374996 }}</ref>

Recent data indicates that the subretinal route may be subject to a greater degree of immune privilege compared to the intravitreal route.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Li Q., Miller R., Han P.-Y., Pang J., Dinculescu A., Chiodo V., Hauswirth W. W. | year = 2008 | title = Intraocular route of AAV2 vector administration defines humoral immune response and therapeutic potential | url = | journal = Molecular vision | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 1760–1769 }}</ref>

===Promoter Sequence===
Expression in various retinal cell types can be determined the promoter sequence. In order to restrict expression to a specific cell type, a tissue-specific or cell-type specific promoter can be used.

For example, in [[rat]] the murine rhodopsin gene drive the expression in AAV2, GFP reporter product was found only in rat photoreceptors, not in any other retinal cell type or in the adjacent RPE after subretinal injection. On the other hand, if ubiquitously expressed immediate-early [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) enhancer-promoter is expressed in a wide variety of transfected cell types. Other ubiquitous promoters such as the CBA promoter, a fusion of the chicken-actin promoter and CMV immediate-early enhancer, allows stable GFP reporter expression in both RPE and photoreceptor cells after subretinal injections.<ref name=Dinculescu>{{cite journal |author=Dinculescu A, Glushakova L, Min SH, Hauswirth WW |title=Adeno-associated virus-vectored gene therapy for retinal disease |journal=Hum. Gene Ther. |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=649\u201363 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15960597 |doi=10.1089/hum.2005.16.649 |url=}}</ref>

===Modulation of expression===
Sometimes modulation of transgene expression may be necessary since strong constitutive expression of a therapeutic gene in retinal tissues could be deleterious for long-term retinal function.  Different methods have been utilized for the expression modulation. One way is using exogenously regulatable promoter system in AAV vectors. For example, the [[tetracycline]]-inducible expression system  uses a silencer/transactivator AAV2 vector and a separate inducible doxycline-responsive coinjection.<ref name=Dinculescu/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sanftner MLH, Rendahl KG, Quiroz D, Coyne M, Ladner M, Manning WC, Flannery JF | year = 2001 | title = Recombinant AAV-mediated delivery of a tet-inducible reporter gene to the rat retina | url = | journal = Mol Ther | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 688–696 }}</ref> When induction occurs by oral [[doxycycline]], this system shows tight regulation of gene expression in both photoreceptor and RPE cells.

===Various Examples and Animal Models===

====Targeting RPE====

One study that was done by [[Royal College of Surgeons]] (RCS) in rat model shows that a recessive mutation in a receptor  tyrposine kinase gene, mertk results in a premature stop [[codon]] and impaired phagocytosis function by RPE cells. This mutation causes the accumulation of outer segment debris in the subretinal space, which causes photoreceptor [[cell death]]. The model organism with this disease received a subretinal injection of AAV serotype 2 carrying a mouse Mertk cDNA under the control of either the CMV or RPE65 promoters. This treatment was found to prolong photoreceptor cell survival for several months <ref>Smith LE.  Vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor expression in a mouse model of retinal neovascularization. PNAS(1995);92:905-909.</ref> and also the number of photoreceptor was 2.5 fold higher in AAV-Mertk- treated eyes compared with controls 9 weeks after injection, also they found decreased amount of debris in the subretinal space.

The protein RPE65 is used in the retinoid cycle where the all-trans-retinol within the  rod outer segment is isomerized to its 11-cis form and oxidized to 11-cis retinal before it goes back to the photoreceptor  and joins with opsin molecule to form functional rodopsin.<ref>Kuksa V, Imanishi Y, Batten M, Placzewski K, Moise AR. Retinoid cycle in the vertebrate retina: Experimental approaches and mechanisms of isomerization. Vison Res(2003);43:2959-2981</ref>  In animal knockout model (RPE65-/-), gene transfer experiment shows that early intraocular delivery of human RPE65 vector on embryonic day 14 shows efficient transduction of retinal pigment epithelium in the RPE65-/-  knockout mice and rescues visual functions. This shows successful gene therapy can be attributed to early intraocular deliver to the diseased animal.

====Targeting of Photoreceptors====
Juvenile [[retinoschisis]] is a disease that affects the [[nerve tissue]] in the eye.  This disease is an X-linked recessive degenerative disease of the central [[Macula of retina|macula]] region, and it is caused by mutation in the RSI gene encoding the protein retinoschisin. Retinoschisin is produced in the photoreceptor and bipolar cells and it is critical in maintaining the synaptic integrity of the retina.<ref name=Dinculescu/>

Specifically the AAV 5 vector containing the wild-type human RSI cDNA driven by a [[mouse]] opsin promoter showed long-term retinal functional and structural recovery. Also the retinal structural reliability   improved greatly after the treatment, characterized by an increase in the [[outer nuclear layer]] thickness.<ref name=Dinculescu/>

====Retinitis pigmentosa====
[[Retinitis pigmentosa]] is an inherited disease which leads to progressive [[night blindness]] and loss of [[peripheral vision]] as a result of photoreceptor cell death.<ref name=Dinculescu/><ref name=Dryja>Dryja TP, LI T. Molecular genetics of retinitis pigmentosa. Human. Molecular.Genet(1995);4:1739-1743.</ref><ref>Farrar GJ, Kenna PF, Humphries P. On the genetics of retinitis pigmentosa and on mutation-independent approaches to therapeutic intervention. EMBO J(2002);21:857-864.
</ref> Different type of inheritance can attribute to this disease; autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked type, etc. The main function of rhodopsin is initiating the [[phototransduction]] cascade. The opsin proteins are made in the photoreceptor inner segments, then transported to the outer segment, and eventually phagocytized by the RPE cells. When mutations occur in the rhodopsin the directional protein movement is affected because the mutations can affect [[protein folding]], stability, and intracellular trafficking. One approach is introducing AAV-delivered  ribozymes designed to target and destroy a mutant mRNA.<ref name=Dinculescu/>

The way this system operates was shown in animal model that have a mutant rhodopsin gene. The injected AAV-ribozymes were optimized [[in vitro]] and used to cleave the mutant mRNA transcript of P23H (where most mutation occur) in vivo.<ref name=Dinculescu/>

Another mutation in the rhodopsin structural protein, specifically peripherin 2 which is a membrane glycoprotein involved in the formation of photoreceptor outersegment disk, can lead to recessive RP and [[macular degeneration]] in human<ref name=Dryja/> (19). In a mouse experiment, AAV2 carrying a wild-type peripherin 2 gene driven by a rhodopsin promoter was delivered to the mice by subretinal injection.  The result showed improvement in photoreceptor structure and function which was detected by ERG (electroretinogram). The result showed improvement of photoreceptor structure and function which was detected by ERG. Also peripherin 2 was detected at the outer segment layer of the retina 2 weeks after injection and therapeutic effects were noted as soon as 3 weeks after injection.  Interestingly, a well-defined outer segment containing both peripherin2 and rhodopsin was present 9 month after injection.<ref name=Dinculescu/>

Since [[apoptosis]] can be the cause of photoreceptor death in most of the retinal dystrophies. It has been known that survival factors and antiapoptoic reagents can be an alternative treatment if the mutation is unknown for gene replacement therapy. Experiments were carried out  to study whether supplying AAV2 vectors with cDNA for  [[glial cell]] line-derived  neurotrophic factor (GDNF) can have an  anti-apoptosis effect on the [[rod cell]]s.<ref name=Dinculescu/><ref name=Sanftner>{{cite journal | author = Sanftner LHM, Abel H, Hauswirth WW, Flannery JG | year = 2001 | title = Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor delays photoreceptor degeneration in a transgenic rat model of retinitis pigmentosa | url = | journal = Mol.Ther | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 622–629 }}</ref>
In looking at an animal model, the opsin transgene contains a truncated protein lacking the last 15 [[amino acid]]s of the C terminus, which causes alteration in rhodopsin transport  to the outer segment and leads to retinal degeneration <ref name=Dinculescu/> When the AAV2-CBA-GDNF vector is administered to the subretinal space, photoreceptor stabilized and rod photoreceptors increased and this was seen in the improved function of the ERG analysis.<ref name=Sanftner/>

====AAV-Based Treatment for Retinal Neovascular Diseases====
Ocular neovascularization (NV) is the abnormal formation of new capillaries from already existing blood vessels in the eye, and this is a characteristics for ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and (wet form) age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  One of the main players in these diseases is VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) which is known to induce vessel leakage and which is also known to be angiogenic.<ref name=Dinculescu/> In normal tissues VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation  in  a dose dependent manner, but such activity is lost with other angiogenic factors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Connollly DT, Heuvelman DM, Nelson R, Olander JR, Eppley BL, Delfino JJ, Siegel NR, Leimgruber RM, Feder J.

Clin.Invest | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 1470–1478 }}</ref>

Many angiostatic factors have been shown  to counteract the effect of increasing local VEGF.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor ([[PEDF]]) also acts as an inhibitor of [[angiogenesis]]. The secretion of PEDF is noticeably decreased under hypoxic conditions allowing the endothelial mitogenic activity of VEGF to dominate, suggesting that the loss of PEDF plays a central role in the development of [[ischemia]]-driven NV. One interesting clinical finding shows that the levels of PEDF in [[aqueous humor]] of human are decreased with increasing age, indicating that the reduction may lead to the development of AMD.<ref name=Dinculescu/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Ogata N, Tombran-Tink J, Jo N, Mrazek D, Matsumura M | year = 2001 | title = Upregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor after laser photocoagulation | url = | journal = American J. ophthalmol | volume = 132 | issue = | pages = 427–429 }}</ref> In animal model, an AAV with human PEDF cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter  prevented choroidal and retinal NV  <ref>{{cite journal | author = Mori K, Duh E, Gehlbach P, Ando A, Takahashi K, Pearlman J, Yang HS, Zack DJ, Ettyreddy D ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits retinal and choroidal neovascularization | url = | journal = J Cell Physio | volume = 188 | issue = | pages = 253–263 }}</ref> ( 24).

The finding suggests that the AAV-mediated expression of angiostatic factors can be implemented to treat NV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Apte RS, Barreiro RA, Duh E, Volpert O, Ferguson TA | year = 2004 | title = Stimulation of neovascularization by the anti angiogenic factor PEDF | url = | journal = Invest.Ophthalmol.Vis.Sci | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 4491–4497 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/gt.2011.169 | pmid =  }}</ref>  This approach could be useful as an alternative to frequent injections of recombinant protein into the eye.
