''[[Staphylococcus]]'' is a [[Gram-positive]] [[bacteria]] which includes several species that can cause a wide variety of infections in humans and other animals through infection or the production of toxins. 
Staphylococcal toxins are a common cause of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]], as they can be produced in improperly-stored food. Staphylococci are also known to be a cause of bacterial [[conjunctivitis|pink eye]].<ref>http://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm</ref>

==Coagulase-positive ==
{{Further|Staphylococcus aureus#Role in disease}}

The main [[coagulase]]-positive staphylococcus is ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', although not all strains of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' are coagulase positive.

These bacteria can survive on dry surfaces, increasing the chance of transmission. ''S. aureus'' is also implicated in [[toxic shock syndrome]]; during the 1980s some tampons allowed the rapid growth of ''S. aureus'', which released toxins that were absorbed into the bloodstream. Any ''S. aureus'' infection can cause the [[staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]], a cutaneous reaction to [[exotoxin]] absorbed into the bloodstream. It can also cause a type of [[septicaemia]] called [[pyaemia]]. The infection can be life-threatening. Problematically, [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) has become a major cause of [[Nosocomial infection|hospital-acquired infections]], and is being recognized with increasing frequency in community-acquired infections.<ref>Sahebnasagh R, Saderi H, Owlia P.

==Etymology==
The generic name ''Staphylococcus'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "staphyle" meaning a bunch of grapes, and "kokkos" means granule. The bacteria, when seen under a microscope appear like a branch of grapes or berries.

Other infections include:
*Closed-space infections of the fingertips, known as [[paronychia]].

==Coagulase-negative==
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'', a [[coagulase]]-negative staphylococcus species, is a commensal of the [[skin]], but can cause severe infections in [[immunosuppression|immune-suppressed]] patients and those with [[central venous catheters]].

* ''[[Staphylococcus saprophyticus|S. saprophyticus]]'', another [[coagulase]]-negative species that is part of the normal [[vaginal flora]], is predominantly implicated in [[genitourinary tract]] infections in sexually-active young women.

* In recent years, several other staphylococcal species have been implicated in human infections, notably ''[[Staphylococcus lugdunensis|S. lugdunensis]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus schleiferi|S. schleiferi]]'', and ''[[Staphylococcus caprae|S. caprae]]''.
