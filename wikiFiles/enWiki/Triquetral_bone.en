The '''triquetral bone''' (also called '''triquetrum''', '''pyramidal''', '''three-cornered''' or '''triangular''' bone, and formerly '''cuneiform''' bone) is located in the [[wrist]] on the medial side of the proximal row of the [[carpus]] between the [[Lunate bone|lunate]] and [[pisiform bone|pisiform]] bones. It is on the [[ulnar]] side of the hand, but does not articulate with the [[ulna]]. It connects with the [[pisiform]], [[hamate]], and [[Lunate bone|lunate]] bones. It is the 3rd most commonly fractured carpal bone.

The triangular bone may be distinguished by its pyramidal shape, and by an oval isolated facet for articulation with the pisiform bone. It is situated at the upper and ulnar side of the carpus. To facilitate its palpation in an exam, the hand must be radially deviated so that the triquetrium moves out from under the ulnar styloid process. The triquetrum may be difficult to find, since it also lies under the pisiform.

The etymology derives from the Latin ''triquetrus'' which means "three-cornered." In reptiles and amphibians, the bone is instead referred to as the ''ulnare'', since (at least in the most primitive fossils) it articulates with the [[ulna]].

==Surfaces==
The ''superior surface'' presents a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex articular portion which articulates with the triangular articular disk of the wrist. 

The ''inferior surface'', directed lateralward, is concave, sinuously curved, and smooth for articulation with the hamate. The dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments. 

The ''volar surface'' presents, on its medial part, an oval facet, for articulation with the pisiform; its lateral part is rough for ligamentous attachment. 

The ''lateral surface'', the base of the pyramid, is marked by a flat, quadrilateral facet, for articulation with the lunate. 

The ''medial surface'', the summit of the pyramid, is pointed and roughened, for the attachment of the ulnar collateral ligament of the wrist.
