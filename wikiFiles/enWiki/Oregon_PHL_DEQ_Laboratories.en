The '''Oregon PHL/DEQ Laboratories''' are the [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]] (DEQ) and [[Oregon Department of Human Services]] (DHS) laboratories located in a single building in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], [[Oregon]], United States. DHS operates the '''Oregon State Public Health Laboratory''' (OSPHL), and the DEQ operates their '''Laboratory and Environmental Assessment Division''' at the site. The laboratories previously were located at [[Portland State University]], moving to the new location near [[Cornelius Pass Road]] and the [[Sunset Highway (Oregon)|Sunset Highway]] (U.S. Route 26) in northeast Hillsboro in 2007.

Built at a cost of $35 million, the laboratories cover {{convert|86000|ft2}} on a {{convert|2|acre|adj=on}} site. DEQ’s lab is an all hazards facility used primarily for testing air and water samples from around the state. The OSPHL operates a [[Biosafety level|biosafety level 3]] lab onsite. OSPHL mainly conducts screenings of newborn baby blood samples from a six state region, and testing for and investigations of [[infectious disease]]s. The combined facility has around 160 employees.

==History==
In 1903, the state government created the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory.<ref>[http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/phl/about_us.shtml About Us.] Oregon State Public Health Laboratory.
