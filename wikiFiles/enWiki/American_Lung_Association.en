The '''American Lung Association''' is a voluntary health organization whose mission is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease.<ref>http://www.lungusa.org/about-us/</ref>

==History==
The organization was founded in 1904 to fight [[tuberculosis]] as the '''National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis''' by [[Edward Livingston Trudeau]], Dr. Robert Hall Babcock, Dr. Henry Martyn Hall and Dr. [[Lawrence Flick.]]. Earlier in 1892 Flick had founded the Pennsylvania Society for the prevention of TB, the world's first society dedicated to the prevention of TB. NASPT was Renamed the '''National Tuberculosis Association''' (NTA) in 1918, and then the '''National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association''' (NTRDA) in 1968, it adopted its current name in 1973. Taglines included, "It's a matter of life and breath," "When you can't breathe, nothing else matters" and currently, "Fighting for Air"

In 1907, the Lung Association began their [[Christmas Seals|Christmas Seal]] campaign to raise money for a small TB sanatorium in Delaware. [[Emily Bissell]], a Red Cross volunteer at the time, created holiday seals to sell at the post office for a penny a piece. By the end of her fundraising campaign, she had raised more than ten times the amount needed to save the sanatorium and the tradition of Christmas Seals was born<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Christmas Seals|url=http://www.christmasseals.org/history-of-christmas-seals.html|work=American Lung Association Christmas Seal Website|accessdate=August 10, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110714135140/http://www.christmasseals.org/history-of-christmas-seals.html| archivedate= July 14 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Logo==
A modified version of the [[Cross of Lorraine]] serves as the ALA's logo. The Paris, France, physician Dr. Gilbert Sersiron suggested its use in 1902 as a symbol for the "crusade" against tuberculosis. The double barred cross was originally used in the coat of arms of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], Duke of Lower Lorraine, a leader of the first crusade and elected ruler of Jerusalem after its capture in 1099.<ref>{{cite web
