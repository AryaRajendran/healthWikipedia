'''Type I hypersensitivity''' (or '''immediate hypersensitivity''') is an allergic reaction provoked by reexposure to a specific type of [[antigen]] referred to as an [[allergen]].<ref>{{eMedicine|med|1101}}</ref>  Type I is not to be confused with [[Type II hypersensitivity|Type II]], [[Type III hypersensitivity|Type III]], or [[Type IV hypersensitivity|Type IV]] hypersensitivities.

Exposure may be by [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], [[injection (medicine)|injection]], or direct contact.

==Pathophysiology==
In type 1 hypersensitivity, an [[antigen]] is presented to [[CD4+]] [[Th2]] cells specific to the antigen that stimulate [[B-cell]] production of [[IgE]] antibodies also specific to the antigen.  The difference between a normal infectious immune response and a type 1 hypersensitivity response is that in type 1 hypersensitivity the antibody is IgE instead of [[IgA]], [[IgG]], or [[IgM]].  During sensitisation, the IgE antibodies bind to Fcε receptors on the surface of tissue [[mast cells]] and blood basophils.<ref name="urlThe Adaptive Immune System: Type I Immediate Hypersensitivity">{{cite web |url=http://student.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit5/hypersensitivity/type1/type1.html |title=The [[Adaptive Immune System]]: Type I Immediate Hypersensitivity |work= |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> [[Mast cells]] and [[basophils]] coated by IgE antibodies are "sensitised." Later exposure to the same allergen cross-links the bound IgE on sensitised cells, resulting in [[degranulation]] and the secretion of pharmacologically active mediators such as [[histamine]], [[leukotriene]] (LTC4 and LTD4), and [[prostaglandin]] that act on the surrounding tissues. The principal effects of these products are [[vasodilation]] and [[smooth muscle|smooth-muscle]] contraction.

Type 1 hypersensitivity can be further classified into an immediate and late-phase reaction.  The immediate hypersensitivity reaction occurs minutes after exposure and includes release of vasoactive amines and lipid mediators, whereas the late-phase reaction occurs 2–4 hours after exposure and includes the release of [[cytokines]].<ref name="Abbas">{{cite book |author=Shiv Pillai MD; Abul K.

The reaction may be either local or systemic. Symptoms vary from mild irritation to sudden death from [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]].

==Treatment and prognosis==
Treatment usually involves [[adrenaline]] ([[epinephrine]]), [[antihistamines]], and [[corticosteroid]]s. If the entire body gets involved, then [[anaphylaxis]] can take place, which is an acute, systemic reaction that can prove fatal.

==Examples==
Some examples:
*Allergic [[asthma]]
*Allergic [[conjunctivitis]]
*[[Allergic rhinitis]] ("hay fever")
*[[Anaphylaxis]]
*[[Angioedema]]
*[[Urticaria]] (hives)
*[[Eosinophilia]]
*[[Penicillin]] allergy
*[[Cephalosporin]] allergy
*[[Food allergy]]
