==History==
The condition was certainly known by the 4th century BC to ancient Greek, and subsequently Roman, naturalists, physicians and theologians. The [[Bible]] (Numbers 11:31-34) mentions an incident where the Israelites became ill after having consumed large amounts of quail in Sinai.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ouzounellis T | title=Some notes on quail poisoning | journal=JAMA |date=16 February 1970 |volume=211 | issue=7 | pages=1186–7 | pmid=4904256 | doi=10.1001/jama.1970.03170070056017}}</ref> Philo gives a more detailed version of the same Biblical story (The Special Laws: 4: 120-131). Early writers used quail as the standard example of an animal that could eat something poisonous to man without ill effects for themselves. [[Aristotle]] (''On Plants'' 820:6-7), [[Philo]] (''Geoponics'': 14: 24), [[Lucretius]] (''On the Nature of Things'': 4: 639-640), [[Galen]] (''De Temperamentis'': 3:4) and [[Sextus Empiricus]] (Outlines of Pyrrhonism: 1: 57) all make this point.

There can be no doubt that this literary example only made sense because the possibility of poisoning from eating quail was widely understood. Central to these ancient accounts is the thesis that quail became toxic to humans after consuming seeds from [[hellebore]]  or [[henbane]] (''Hyoscyamus niger''). However Sextus Empiricus suggested that quail ate [[Conium|hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum''), an idea revived in the 20th century. Confirmation that the ancients understood the problem, comes from a 10th century text ''Geoponica'', based on ancient sources. This states, "Quails may graze hellebore putting those who afterwards eat them at risk of convulsions and vertigo....".<ref>{{cite book |page=294 |title=Geoponica : farm work: a modern translation of the Roman and Byzantine farming handbook |author=Andrew Dalby Totnes |publisher=Prospect |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-903018-69-9 }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Migration routes and season may affect quail risk.<ref name="pmid16700632">{{cite journal |author=Giannopoulos D, Voulioti S, Skarpelos A, Arvanitis A, Chalkiopoulou C |title=Quail poisoning in a child |journal=Rural Remote Health |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=564 |year=2006 |pmid=16700632 |doi= |url=http://www.rrh.org.au/articles/subviewnew.asp?ArticleID=564}}</ref> Quail are never poisonous outside the migration season nor are the vast majority poisonous while migrating.<ref name="Doi">{{cite journal |title=Coturnism: Human Poisoning by European Migratory Quail |year=1987 |author=Lewis DC, Metallinos-Katzaras E, Grivetti LE |journal=Journal of Cultural Geography |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=51–65 |doi=10.1080/08873638709478507 }}</ref> European Common Quail migrate along three different flyways each with different poisoning characteristics, at least in 20th century records. The western flyway across Algeria to France is associated with poisonings only on the spring migration and not on the autumn return. The eastern flyway, which funnels down the Nile Valley is the reverse. Poisonings were only reported in the autumn migration before the quail had crossed the Mediterranean (despite the Bible story, no modern poisonings have been reported from Sinai). The central flyway across Italy had no associated poisonings.<ref name="Doi" />

Migrating quail used to be caught and eaten in prodigious numbers (150,000 quail exported from Capri in 1850)<ref>{{cite book |author=Toschi A |year=1959 |title=La quaglia: vita, caccia, allevamento |series=Supplemento alle Ricerche di Zoologia Applicata alla Caccia |volume=3 |issue=1 |location=Bologna |publisher=Università di Bologna |oclc=66552512 |page=110}}</ref> but modern farming and droughts in the [[Sahel]] have led to a vast reduction in the size of the migrations. Conservation efforts and the availability of farmed quail have also reduced the consumption of these wild birds. Coturnism may well disappear before it is understood.

==Etiology==
From case histories it is known that the toxin is stable as four-month-old pickled quail have been poisonous. Humans vary in their susceptibility; only one in four people who consumed quail soup fell ill.<ref name="Doi"/>  The toxin is apparently fat-soluble as potatoes fried in quail fat have proved poisonous.<ref name="Doi"/>

[[Coniine]] from hemlock consumed by quail has been suggested as the cause,<ref name="Clatworthy2010">{{cite book|last=Clatworthy|first=Menna|title=Nephrology: Clinical Cases Uncovered|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=55VOagYjaVkC&pg=PA145|accessdate=10 August 2011|date=15 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8990-3|pages=145–}}</ref> though quail resist eating hemlock.<ref name="Doi" /> [[Hellebore]] has also been suggested as the source of the toxin.<ref name="Dobbs2009">{{cite book|last=Dobbs|first=Michael R.|title=Clinical neurotoxicology: syndromes, substances, environments|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pmcy24y2HyMC&pg=PA166|accessdate=10 August 2011|date=22 May 2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-05260-3|pages=166–}}</ref>  It has also been asserted that that evidence points to the seeds of the Annual Woundwort (''[[Stachys annua]]'') being the causal agent.<ref name="Doi"/> It has been suggested that ''[[Galeopsis]] ladanum'' seeds are not responsible.<ref name="pmid19860419">{{cite journal |author=Uriarte-Pueyo I, Goicoechea M, Gil AG, López de Cerain A, López de Munain A, Calvo MI |title=Negative evidence for stachydrine or Galeopsis ladanum L. seeds as the causal agents of coturnism after quail meat ingestion |journal=J.
