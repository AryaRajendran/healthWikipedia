'''Norrie disease''' is a [[genetic disorder]] that primarily affects the [[human eye|eye]] and almost always leads to [[blindness]]. In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms, some patients suffer from a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life, while another portion may be mentally challenged.

Patients with Norrie disease may develop [[cataracts]], [[leukocoria]] (a condition where the [[pupils]] appear white when light is shone on them), along with other developmental issues in the eye, such as shrinking of the globe and the wasting away of the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name="Sims">Sims , Katherine. "NDP-Related Retinopathies." Gene Reviews. 08 Aug 2006. 28 Jan 2007 <http://www.geneclinics.org/profiles/norrie/></ref>
Around 30–50% of them will also have developmental delay/[[mental retardation]], psychotic-like features, [[Spinocerebellar ataxia|incoordination of movements]] or behavioral abnormalities.<ref name="Sims" /> 
Most patients are born with normal hearing; however, the onset of hearing loss is very common in early adolescence.<ref name="Halpin">{{cite journal |author=Halpin C, Owen G, Gutiérrez-Espeleta G, Sims K, Rehm H |title=Audiologic features of Norrie disease |journal=Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol |volume=114 |issue=7 |pages=533–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16134349}}</ref> About 15% of the patients are estimated to develop all the features of the disease.<ref name="Dickinson">{{cite journal |author=Dickinson JL, Sale MM, Passmore A, FitzGerald LM, Wheatley CM, Burdon KP, Craig JE, Tengtrisorn S, Carden SM, Maclean H, Mackey DA |title=Mutations in the NDP gene: contribution to Norrie disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity |journal=Clin Experiment Ophthalmol. |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=682–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16970763 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2006.01314.x}}</ref>

The disease affects almost only male [[infants]] at birth or soon after birth, because the disease is inherited [[X-linked recessive]]. Only in very rare cases, females have been diagnosed with Norrie disease as well. The exact incidence number is unknown; only a few hundred cases have been reported so far. It is a very rare disorder that is not associated with any specific ethnic or racial groups.<ref name="ghr">"Norrie Disease."

== History ==

In 1961, a Danish [[ophthalmologist]] named Mette Warburg reported that a Danish family showed seven different cases of a [[hereditary]] degenerative disease throughout seven [[generations]].
The first member of the family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child’s examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except for his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating.<ref name="Warburg,M">{{cite journal |author=Warburg M |title=Norrie's disease: a new hereditary bilateral pseudotumour of the retina |journal=Acta Ophthal. (Copenh) |volume=39 |pages=757–772 |year=1961}}</ref> The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass.  Five months later, his left eye was removed due to the suspicion of [[retinoblastoma]], a [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] on the [[retina]]. An [[histology|histologic]] examination showed a hemorrhagic [[necrotic]] mass in the [[posterior chamber]], surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) [[glia]]l tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, [[hyperplasia]] of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment [[epithelium]], [[hypoplasia]] and [[necrosis]] of the inner layer of the retina, [[cataract]], and [[Phthisis bulbi]]. This means his eye was removed because the physician suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that lead to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells already began to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed [[deafness]] later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were cause by this disease as well.<ref name="Warburg,M"/> She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, [[Gordon Norrie]] (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.<ref>"Gordon Norrie."

== Causes ==
[[Image:XlinkRecessive.jpg|thumb|225px|X-linked recessive inheritance.]]
Norrie disease is a genetic disorder caused by [[mutations]] in the ''[[NDP (gene)|NDP]]'' [[gene]], located on Xp11.4 (GeneID: 4693). 
It is inherited in an [[X-linked recessive]] way from usually one of your parents. This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men will not have the mutation, while all of their daughters will be [[genetic carrier]]s of the mutation. They also usually show no clinical symptoms, but will inherit the mutation to 50% of their [[offspring]]. Daughters receiving the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.

Females are very unlikely to express clinical signs. One possible scenario leading to this (unlikely) case would be if both of their copies of the ''NDP'' gene bear mutations, which could be the case in [[consanguineous]] families or due to a spontaneous [[mutation|somatic mutation]]. Another explanation for affected females could be skewed [[X-inactivation|X-Chromosome inactivation]].
 
However, throughout history, there have been a few rare cases where females have shown symptoms associated with Norrie disease such as retinal abnormalities and mild hearing loss.<ref name="ghr" />

=== The ''NDP'' Gene ===

A [[mutation]] in ''[[NDP (gene)|NDP]]'' gene causes Norrie disease.
The official name of the gene is “Norrie disease (pseudoglioma)”. The gene’s official symbol is ''NDP''. The normal function of the ''NDP'' gene is to produce the instructions for creating a [[protein]] called norrin. For the normal development of the eye and other body systems, norrin is believed to be crucial.<ref name="GeneticsHomeReference">{{Cite encyclopedia

}}</ref> Norrin also appears to be crucial in the specialization of the cells of the retina and the establishment of a [[blood]] supply to the [[inner ear]] and the tissues of the retina. The role of norrin in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory is interfered by the mutation of ''NDP''.<ref name="GeneticsHomeReference"/>
This results in an accumulation of immature retinal cells in the back of the eye.
When norrin’s role in the establishment of [[blood vessels]] supplying the eye is disrupted, eventually the tissues will break down.<ref name="GeneticsHomeReference"/>

Norrin is not only important in the development of the eye. The mutation of the ''NDP'' gene can affect other systems of the body as well. The most severe problems are caused by chromosomal deletions in the region of the ''NDP'' gene, causing the prevention of the gene product, or even that of the neighboring [[Monoamine oxidase|''MAO'']] genes. When the mutations simply change a single [[amino acid]] in norrin, the effects are less widespread and severe. However, the location and type of the ''NDP'' mutation not necessarily determine the degree of severity of the disease, since highly varying clinical signs have been diagnosed in patients carrying the very same mutation. Therefore, the involvement of other modifying genes is very likely. On the other hand, if certain structurally important amino acids are changed (e.g. the [[Cysteine]]s forming the putative [[cystine knot]]), the clinical outcome has been shown to be more serious.<ref name="Meitinger">{{cite journal

== Diagnosis ==

As of right now, Norrie disease and other NDP related diseases are diagnosed with the combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 85% of affected males.<ref name="Sims" /> Clinical diagnoses rely on [[human eye|ocular]] findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through eight-ten years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris [[atrophy]], shallowing of [[anterior chamber]], and shrinking of the globe.<ref name="Sims" /> By this point, the [[Visual perception|vision]] is light perception impaired or non-existent. 

Molecular genetic testing is used for more than an initial diagnosis. It is used to confirm [[diagnostic testing]], for carrier testing females, [[prenatal]] diagnosis, and preimplantion genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 85% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis.<ref name="Sims" /> Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are [[submicroscopic]] deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is linkage analysis, which is used when the first two are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.<ref name="Sims" />

== Symptoms ==

The most prominent symptoms of Norrie disease are ocular. The first visible finding is [[Leukocoria]], a grayish-yellow [[pupil]]lary reflex that originates from a mass of unorganized tissue behind the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. This material, which possibly includes an already [[retinal detachment|detached retina]], may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed [[glioma|pseudoglioma]].<ref name="Sims" />
<ref name="ghr" /> However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and inconspicuous [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], [[anterior chamber]], [[cornea]] and [[intraocular pressure]].

Over the first few months of life, complete or partial [[retinal detachment]] evolves. From the time they’re a baby through [[childhood]], the patient may undergo progressive changes in the disease.<ref name="Sims" /> These progressions include the formation of [[cataracts]], deterioration of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] with [[adhesions]] forming between the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] or the [[cornea]], and shallowing of the [[anterior chamber]] which increases [[intraocular pressure]] that can become painful.<ref name="Sims" /> As the situation worsens, there is corneal opacification, where the [[cornea]] becomes opaque, and band keratopathy. Intraocular pressure is lost and the globe shrinks.
In the last stage of Norrie disease, the globes appear small and sunken in ([[phthisis bulbi]]) and the [[cornea]] appears to be milky .<ref name="Sims" />

Norrie disease can also have [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] symptoms. Developmental delay and mental retardation are present in about 30–50% of males who have Norrie disease.<ref name="Sims" /> Psychotic-like features and poorly characterized behavior abnormalities may also be present. [[Auditory system|Auditory]] symptoms are often common with Norrie disease. Progressive hearing loss starts in early childhood for a majority of males with the disease. Early hearing loss is [[sensorineural]], mild and asymmetric.<ref name="Sims" /> By [[adolescence]], high-frequency hearing loss begins to appear. Hearing loss is severe, symmetric, and broad-spectrum by the age of 35. However, studies show that while the hearing loss is deteriorating, the ability to speak well is highly preserved.<ref name="Halpin" /> The slowly progressing hearing loss is more problematic in adjusting to than the [[congenital]] blindness for most people with Norrie disease.<ref name="Sims" />
