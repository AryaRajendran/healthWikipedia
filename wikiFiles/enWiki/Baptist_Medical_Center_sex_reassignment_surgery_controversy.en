The '''Baptist Medical Center sex reassignment surgery controversy''' occurred in 1977 in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]].  Surgeons at the Baptist Medical Center, a hospital owned by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], were prohibited from performing [[sex reassignment surgery]].

==History==
In 1973, David William Foerstler and Charles Reylonds founded the Gender Identity Foundation at the Baptist Medical Center for the purpose of providing care to transgender patients.<ref name="Sarasota"/>  It was composed of six doctors,<ref name="Evening Independent">{{cite news |title=Hospital Doctors Defend Sex Changes |newspaper=The Evening Independent |date=13 October 1977 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19771013&id=seMLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fVgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5787,2659516 |accessdate=17 December 2009 }}</ref> including Foerstler, Reynolds, Fenton Sanger, and [[endocrinologist]] Jonathan Drake.

By 1977, Oklahoma City was one of the major American centers for [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS) for [[transsexual]] people.<ref name="AGN">{{cite news |title=Sex changes banned at Baptist hospital |newspaper=Arizona Gay News |date=21 October 1977 |url=http://www.tucsonobserver.com/archives/pdf/1977/10/OCT%2021.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>  The number of surgeries rivaled those of [[Stanley Biber]] of [[Trinidad, Colorado]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Most of the patients were [[trans women]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The hospital was one of about seven U.S. hospitals offering sex reassignment surgery.<ref name="Sarasota"/><ref name="AGN"/> 

The surgical procedures offered by Foerester and Reynolds were essentially the same male to female transsexual sex reassignment procedures pioneered by Georges Burou of Casablanca.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Foerester used the [[penile inversion]] procedure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The famous transsexual actress and activist [[Christine Jorgensen]] came to Oklahoma in the late seventies to have some minor corrective surgery on her surgically created genitals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Oklahoma team handled Jorgensen's care at this time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The surgical team required patients to pay in full prior to any genital surgeries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Each patient was required to sign a waiver that they would never sue for malpractice if anything went wrong with the SRS procedures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Controversy==
In July 1977, the [[Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma]] (a state convention of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]) learned that the Gender Identity Foundation had performed more than fifty SRS procedures.<ref name="Baptist Press">{{cite news |title=Oklahoma Baptists Ban Sex Operations, Study Hospitals |newspaper=Baptist Press |date=19 October 1977 |url=http://media.sbhla.org.s3.amazonaws.com/4512,19-Oct-1977.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2009 }}</ref>  Joe L. Ingram, then the state convention's executive director, issued a moratorium on SRS at Baptist Medical Center, until a final decision could be made.<ref name="Baptist Press"/>

Gene Garrison, an Oklahoma City pastor who was on the hospital's Board of Directors,<ref name="Gene Garrison">{{cite web |url=http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mob2/garrison.htm |date=7 April 1999 |publisher=Mainstream Oklahoma Baptists |accessdate=18 December 2009 |title=Gene Garrison| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100105012305/http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mob2/garrison.htm| archivedate= 5 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> supported sex reassignment surgery, calling it "a Christian procedure".{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  He seemed confused about the details, however, believing that post-op trans women could [[menstruate]] and get [[pregnant]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Foerster and Reynolds released a statement saying "If Jesus Christ were alive today, undoubtedly he would render help and comfort to the transsexual as he did the leper, the blind and the lame".<ref name="Evening Independent"/>  The hospital's medical staff and lay advisory board voted overwhelmingly to continue allowing SRS.<ref name="Evening Independent"/>  Foerester told the press that "We won't even touch the patients until they have lived as a woman for two years. Our work ranks up there with that of Johns Hopkins."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Foerester mentioned that a few transsexual patients treated by the team had committed suicide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  In one case, a transman who had cancer committed suicide; Foerester blamed his suicide on the cancer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The late Unity Center minister Reverend Alice Cronley expressed her support for the SRS procedures at Baptist Hospital.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} She stated, "If these transvestites (sic) don't like their penises then they have a right to have Reynolds cut it off. I'm for freedom of choice in all matters".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Reynolds had his 25-year-old son appear with some post-op trans women at the meeting to decide the fate of the procedures at Baptist Medical Center.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Many of Foerster's post-op patients were male to female transsexuals who were in the [[sex trade]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Reynold's son told the ''[[Daily Oklahoman]]'' newspaper that 'these women are genetically female'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  The wife of Foerester told ''The Daily Oklahoman'', "my husband won't abandon these people. One of his latest patients is a psychotherapist from a neighboring state".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

On 14 October 1977, the Board of Directors of the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma voted 54-2 to ban SRS at Baptist Medical Center.<ref name="Sarasota">{{cite news |title=Baptists Vote To Ban Sex Change Operations |author=Jerry Scarbrough |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=15 October 1977 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tcEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bGcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6885,6029916&dq=charles-reynolds+oklahoma&hl=en |accessdate=29 December 2009 }}</ref><ref name="AGN"/>  Curtis Nigh, a pastor from [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]], opposed the decision.<ref name="Baptist Press"/>  Foerster warned that the vote would cause Baptists to be "viewed as bigoted buffoons".<ref name="Baptist Press"/>  At the time of the decision, Baptist Medical Center had been offering SRS for four years, 50 transsexual people had had SRS there, and another 50 were in the process of transitioning.<ref name="Sarasota"/><ref name="Evening Independent"/><ref name="AGN"/>

Foerester told the press that "this is a disease probably beginning in early embryonic life best treated by surgical methods".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Pastor Curtis Nigh stated to the Daily Oklahoman newspaper that "this is about healing for women who feel trapped in men's bodies".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  A post-op transsexual patient of Foerester stated to the Oklahoma news media that "I think they do better work here. I know a gal who had surgery in Colorado (performed by Biber) and she ended up having a colostomy. I have everything that a woman has including the sensitivity".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The patient then ended with a sexually explicit description of her post op sex life and the functioning of her spongiform clitoris structure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Aftermath==
Foerster and the Gender Identity Foundation appealed, but without success.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  They then transferred their operation to [[Oklahoma Memorial Hospital]], which had been allowing a small number of SRS procedures.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Oklahoma Memorial Hospital ended its SRS program in 1981, leaving no hospital in Oklahoma that provided sex reassignment surgery.<ref name="Reading Eagle">{{cite news |title=Sex-Switch Surgery Banned |newspaper=Reading Eagle |date=26 January 1981 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y94hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jKIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6176,3406660&dq=sex+%7C+gender+oklahoma-memorial-hospital&hl=en |accessdate=18 December 2009 }}</ref>

==Current situation==
Sex reassignment surgery still occurs in Oklahoma, but the state is not a major center for SRS.  Foerster continues to provide SRS for trans women and top and bottom surgery for trans men.<ref name="Lynn's Place">{{cite web |url=http://www.tglynnsplace.com/surgeons.htm |title=Transgender Surgeons |year=2008 |work=Lynn's Place |accessdate=18 December 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091212143604/http://www.tglynnsplace.com/surgeons.htm| archivedate= 12 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  A few other doctors, including the Oklahoma Memorial Hospital Gender Reassignment Program, provide FTM top and bottom surgery.<ref name="Lynn's Place"/><ref name="STAG">{{cite web |url=http://stag.transhouston.com/doctorsall.html |title=Doctors |publisher=S.T.A.G. |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>  Most transsexual Oklahomans have their surgery in [[Colorado]] or [[Thailand]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  In the decades since the controversy, Charles Reynolds has died.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Fenton Sanger no longer takes part in SRS  procedures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Foerster is now in his late seventies and seems to be winding up his practice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Both Pastors Gene Garrison and Curtis Nigh left the Southern Baptist convention many years later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  

Curtis Nigh and his wife ended up teaching at the Rose State Junior College in [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He and his wife Linda left Rose State Junior College under controversy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Linda had been accused by African American students of racism and discrimination.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Though an advocate for sex reassignment surgery, Curtis himself was known to make homophobic comments in his religious philosophy classes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Curtis Nigh and Gene Garrison are now both assistant ministers at the controversial Oklahoma congregation called 'The Church Of The Servant'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Pastor Gene Garrison still gives his support for sex change operations. He said a few years ago that 'sex change surgery is a good way to weed homosexuality out of our nation. If I wasn't happily married then I wouldn't mind dating one of these transsexual dears.'{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

As a plastic surgeon, Foerester was responsible for creating and patenting the [[foerster clamp]] used in [[body piercing]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Foerester has tried to develop medical procedures for the body piercing, [[tattoo]], and [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochist]] communities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Foerester is now retired from his medical practice.  He is 78 years of age.
