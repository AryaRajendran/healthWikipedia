Pediatric massage therapy takes into consideration each child’s individual physical development, [[cognitive development]] and heath care needs.

==Evidence==

===Infant massage===
{{Main|Infant massage}}

Infant massage is a type of complementary and alternative treatment that uses massage therapy for human infants. This therapy has been practiced globally, and has been increasingly used in Western countries as a treatment for infants, though the scientific evidence supporting its use is limited.  Research into the effectiveness of massage therapy on full term infants has found some tentative evidence for some benefits such as sleeping and crying in infants, though the evidence is not strong enough to recommend universally, and more research is needed.<ref name=Underdown>{{cite journal |author=Underdown A, Barlow J, Chung V, Stewart-Brown S |title=Massage intervention for promoting mental and physical health in infants aged under six months |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD005038 |year=2006 |pmid=17054233 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005038.pub2 |url=}}</ref>  Research in [[preterm birth|pre-term infants]] and [[low birth weight]] infants have found weak evidence that massage might improve weight gain, but these results are based on possibly biased studies and therefore no recommendation can be made for universal use at this time.<ref name = Vickers>{{cite journal |author=Vickers A, Ohlsson A, Lacy JB, Horsley A |title=Massage for promoting growth and development of preterm and/or low birth-weight infants |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000390 |year=2004 |pmid=15106151 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000390.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

Research shows that massage therapy can ease both physical symptoms as well as emotional discomforts associated with pediatric medical conditions.<ref>Massage therapy in outpatient pediatric chronic pain patients: do they facilitate significant reductions in levels of distress, pain, tension, discomfort, and mood alterations? Suresh S, Wang S, Porfyris S, Kamasinski-Sol R, Steinhorn DM. Paediatr Anaesth. 2008 Sep;18(9):884-7.</ref> The Touch Research Institute at the [[University of Miami]] School of Medicine is a primary medical research provider for massage and touch therapy, including pediatric massage and [[infant massage]]. Pediatric massage also can help manage chronic conditions such as [[asthma]] by providing relaxation and reducing muscle tone in the chest, back and neck, [[nausea]], [[constipation]] and muscle aches ([[myalgia]]).

Immediately after receiving massage, children with mild to moderate [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]] notice decreased anxiety and stress hormone (cortisol) levels.<ref>Physical Medicine in Rehabilitation for Arthritis in Children, Miland E. Knapp, JAMA. 1960;174(15):1951-1953.</ref> For young patients with [[autism]] or [[ADHD]], pediatric massage has been found to reduce their aversion to touch, while increasing their ability to focus.<ref>Field, T., Lasko, D., Mundy, P., Henteleff, T., Talpins, S., & Dowling, M.

===Limitations in research===

Like many other [[complementary and alternative medicine]] modalities, many research studies reporting benefit from pediatric massage have been small in scale and vulnerable to [[bias]]. Comprehensive medical reviews of the existing pediatric massage research reinforce the benefits, but ask for larger-scale, scientifically rigorous studies.<ref>The state of research on complementary and alternative medicine in pediatric rheumatology.
