'''Dermatologic surgeons''' are surgeons who specialize in surgery of the skin.

A dermatologic surgeon demonstrates competence in the diagnosis, medical care, and surgical management of the following:

* Diseases and disorders of the skin, hair, nails, veins, and nearby tissues
* Benign and malignant growths and skin cancers
* Aging and sun-damaged skin
* Cosmetic improvement of the skin

Techniques available to a dermatologic surgeon include lasers, traditional scalpel surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, liposuction, blepharoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery), minimally-invasive facelift surgery (e.g., the S-lift), and a variety of topical and injectable agents such as dermal fillers including fat transfer and hyaluronic acid.

Some specially trained surgeons perform [[Mohs cancer surgery]], which can be an effective method for the treatment of recurrent, indistinct, or difficult skin cancers.
