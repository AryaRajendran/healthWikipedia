'''Good Samaritan laws'''  [[law]]s or acts offering legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. In some cases, Good Samaritan laws encourage people to offer assistance ([[duty to rescue]]).<ref name=dan>[http://www.daneurope.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c09228f3-a745-480b-9549-d9fc8bbbd535&groupId=10103 DAN Legal Network: The Good Samaritan Law across Europe]</ref> The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]].

An example of the obligation to help a  is the [[Argentina]] law on "abandonment of persons", Articles 106-108 of the Argentine Penal Code, which include the provision in Article 106 "a person who endangers the life or health of another, either by putting a person in jeopardy or ''abandoning to their fate a person to cope alone who must be cared for'' ... will be imprisoned for between 2 and 6 years".<ref>[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/penal-especial/penal-especial2.shtml Argentine Penal Code laws regarding crimes against the person] {{es icon}} Original of text translated in the article: "el que pusiere en peligro la  vida o la salud de otro, sea colocándolo en  situación de desamparo, sea  a su suerte a una  persona incapaz de valerse y a la que deba mantener o cuidar o a  la que el mismo autor haya incapacitado, será reprimido  con prisión de 2 a 6 años".</ref>

An example of legal protection without obligation to act: in common-law areas of Canada a good Samaritan [[doctrine]] is a [[legal principle]] that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for 'wrongdoing'. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=Canadian Law website 1|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>

Good Samaritan laws vary from jurisdiction to , as do their interactions with various other legal principles, such as consent, parental rights and the right to refuse treatment.  Most such laws do not apply to medical professionals' or career emergency responders' on-the-job conduct, but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they are acting in a volunteer capacity.

The principles contained in good Samaritan laws more typically operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is [[English Common Law]], such as Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gulam H, Devereaux J|title=A brief primer on Good Samaritan Law for health care professionals|journal=Aust Health Rev|issue=31|number=3|year=2007|pages=478–482|url=http://www.aushealthreview.com.au/publications/articles/issues/ahr_31_3_0807/ahr_31_3_478.asp}}</ref> In many countries that use [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] as the foundation for their legal systems, the same legal effect is more typically achieved using a principle of duty to rescue.

Good Samaritan laws take their  a [[parables of Jesus|parable found in the Bible, attributed to Jesus]], commonly referred to as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] which is contained in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 10:25-37.  It recounts the aid given by a traveler from the area known as [[Samaria]] to another traveler of a conflicting religious and ethnic background who had been beaten and robbed by bandits.<ref>Good Samaritan.

==United States==
The details of good Samaritan laws/acts in various jurisdictions vary, including who is protected from liability and in what circumstances.<ref>The laws include: Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code § 5-603; Virginia Code § 8.01-225.</ref> Not all jurisdictions provide protection to laypersons, in those cases only protecting trained personnel, such as doctors or nurses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medi-smart.com/gslaw.htm|title=Good Samaritan Statutes (Medi-smart website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>

===Common features===
In some jurisdictions, unless a caretaker relationship (such as a parent-child or doctor-patient relationship) exists prior to the illness or injury, or the "good Samaritan" is responsible for the existence of the illness or injury, no person is required to give aid of any sort to a victim. Good Samaritan statutes in the states of Minnesota and Vermont do require a person at the scene of an emergency to provide reasonable assistance to a person in need.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cprinstructor.com/VT-GS.htm|title=Vermont Good Samaritan Law|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> This assistance may be to call [[9-1-1]]. Violation of the duty-to-assist subdivision is a petty misdemeanor in Minnesota and may warrant a fine of up to $100 in Vermont. At least five other states, including California and Nevada, have seriously considered adding duty-to-assist subdivisions to their good Samaritan statutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Help Your Neighbor—It’s the Law|url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/399HELP.HTM|date=1999-03-01|accessdate=2008-10-20|last=Lyons|first=Donna|publisher=''State Legislatures''| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070907234121/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/399HELP.HTM| archivedate = September 7, 2007}}</ref>  New York's law provides immunity for those who assist in an emergency.<ref name="NY law">N.Y.

Good Samaritan provisions are not universal in   The legal principle of [[imminent peril]] may also apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/goodsamaritanl_redg.htm|title=What is the Good Samaritan Law? (essortment website)|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>  In the absence of imminent peril, the actions of a rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries and no danger of a second collision.  If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-23-samaritan-accident_N.htm|title=Good samaritan law may not apply (USA Today)|accessdate=2008-10-17 | date=2007-03-23}}</ref><ref>See also, California Supreme Court decision in ''Van Horn vs. Torti'', December 18, 2008, with a similar fact pattern and limitation of protection to medical personnel rendering medical aid.</ref>

Only [[first aid]] provided without intention of reward or financial compensation is covered. Medical professionals are typically not protected by good Samaritan laws when performing first aid in connection with their employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=4.24.300|title=RCW 4.24.300 Immunity from liability for certain types of medical care (Washington State Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Some states make specific provisions for trained medical professionals acting as volunteers and for members of volunteer rescue squads acting without expectation of remuneration.<ref name="NY law" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.mesastate.edu/~jerry/gmnc/Colorado%20Good%20Samaritan%20Law.htm|title=Colorado Good Samaritan Law|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>  In Texas, a physician who voluntarily assisted in the delivery of an infant, and who proved that he had "no expectation of remuneration", had no liability for the infant's injuries due to allegedly ordinary negligence; there was "uncontroverted testimony that neither he nor any doctor in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] would have charged a fee to [the mother] or any other person under the circumstances of this case."<ref name="Texas law">''McIntyre v.

If a responder begins rendering aid, he must not leave the scene  it is necessary to call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe.<ref>This can be as simple as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as [[vinyl]], [[latex]], or [[nitrile]] gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person.</ref> The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rolfsen ML |title=Medical care provided during a disaster should be immune from liability or criminal prosecution |journal=The Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society : official organ of the Louisiana State Medical Society |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=224–5, 227–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17987961 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Consent===
The responder must obtain the consent  of the patient, or of  guardian of a patient who is a [[Minor (law)|minor]], unless this is not possible; failing to do so may attract a charge of [[assault]] or [[battery (tort)|battery]]. All "Good Samaritans" must state their level of training if previously trained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

====Implied consent====
{{Main|Implied consent}}
Consent may be implied if an unattended patient is unconscious, delusional, intoxicated or deemed mentally unfit to make decisions regarding their safety, or if the responder has a reasonable belief that this was so; courts tend to be very forgiving in adjudicating this, under the [[legal fiction]] that "peril invites rescue" (as in the [[rescue doctrine]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=904&bold=|title=Implied Consent (Lawdictionary.com website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> The test in most jurisdictions is that of the 'average, reasonable person'.  To illustrate, would the average, reasonable person in any of the states described above consent to receiving assistance in these circumstances if able to make a decision?

Consent may also be implied if the legal parent or guardian is not immediately reachable and the patient is not considered an adult.

====Parental consent====
If the victim is a minor, consent must come from a parent or guardian. However, if the legal parent or guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder is not required to withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] or the [[Henry Heimlich#The Heimlich maneuver|Heimlich maneuver]]) from a minor if the parent or guardian will not consent.  The parent or guardian is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if [[child abuse]] is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counselors).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Foltin GL, Lucky C, Portelli I, ''et al.'' |title=Overcoming legal obstacles involving the voluntary care of children who are separated from their legal guardians during a disaster |journal=Pediatric emergency care |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=392–8 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18562886 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e318178c05d}}</ref>

====Laws for first responders only====
In some jurisdictions,{{which|date=May 2012}} good Samaritan laws only protect those who have completed basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]], or [[American Red Cross]], provided that they have acted within the scope of their training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/lrc/recommendations/GoodSamaritanFiremansRuleFinalRpt.htm|title=Good Samaritan/Fireman's Rule (Connecticut State Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>  In these jurisdictions, a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and who performs first aid incorrectly, can be held legally liable for errors made. In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In Florida, paramedics EMTs and Emergency Medical Responders (First Responders) are required by law to act under the Duty to Act law, which requires them to stop and give aid that falls within their practice.

==Canada==
In Canada, good Samaritan acts are a [[Province|provincial]] power.  Each province has its own act, such as [[Ontario]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/d9dc707e-281a-473f-af21-6a407eb94c43/1/frame/?search=browseStatutes&context=|title=Good Samaritan Act, S.O., 2001 (Ontario E-laws website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> and [[British Columbia]]'s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96172_01|title=Good Samaritan Act [RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 172 (British Columbia Queen's Printer website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> respective good Samaritan acts;  [[Alberta]]'s Emergency Medical Aid Act;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/E07.CFM|title=Emergency Medical Aid Act (Alberta Queen's Printer website|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>  and [[Nova Scotia]]'s Volunteer Services Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/statutes/volnteer.htm|title=Volunteer Services Act 'Good Samaritan' RSNS 1989 (amend. 1992) (Nova Scotia Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>  Only in [[Quebec law|Quebec]], a civil law jurisdiction, does a person have a general duty to respond, as written in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedom|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/C_12/C12_A.HTM|accessdate=2012-07-18|publisher=Éditeur officiel du Québec}}</ref><ref name="cangoodsam">{{cite web | title=Good Samaritan Law from The Canadian Association of Food Banks | url=http://www.cafb-acba.ca/english/GetInvolved-GoodSamaritanLaw.html  |accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=Canadian Association of Food Banks (via Internet Archive) |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217050919/http://www.cafb-acba.ca/english/GetInvolved-GoodSamaritanLaw.html |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>

An example of a typical Canadian law is provided here, from Ontario's Good Samaritan Act, 2001, section 2:
<blockquote>
Protection from liability

2. (1) Despite the rules of common law, a person described in subsection (2) who voluntarily and without reasonable expectation of compensation or reward provides the services described in that subsection is not liable for damages that result from the person's [[negligence]] in acting or failing to act while providing the services, unless it is established that the damages were caused by the gross negligence of the person. 2001, c. 2, s. 2 (1).<ref name="ontgoodsam">{{cite web | title=Good Samaritan Act, 2001 ©Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2005 | url=http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/2001c.2/20051114/whole.html | accessdate=December 26, 2005}}</ref>
</blockquote>

New Brunswick and Nunavut do not have Good Samaritan laws.

==Europe==
Laws in North America mainly shield from liability those who choose to help in a situation they did not cause; laws in much of Europe and other countries criminalize failure to help in such a situation:<ref>{{cite news|title="Good Samaritan Laws" Common in Europe but Rare in America|last=Benac|first=Nancy|date=1997-09-05|accessdate=2010-01-07|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=55007354&sid=3&Fmt=3&clientId=20886&RQT=309&VName=PQD|issn=0749405X|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|page=7.A}} (Registration Required)</ref> people in such countries who do not help someone in peril may be prosecuted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/july-dec97/french_9-3.html |title=Online NewsHour: French Legal System - September 3, 1997 |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__323c.html |title=StGB - Einzelnorm |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>

==Comparison with duty to rescue==
Good Samaritan laws may be confused with the [[duty to rescue]], as described above. U.S. and Canadian approaches to this issue differ.  Under the common law, good Samaritan laws provide a defence against torts arising from the attempted rescue. Such laws do not constitute a [[duty to rescue]], such as exists in some civil law countries,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Higuchi N |title=[Good Samaritan Act and physicians' duty to rescue] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=382–4 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18434681 |doi= |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/jjrt/64.382?from=PubMed |format=}} {{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> and in the common law under certain circumstances. However, the duty to rescue where it exists may itself imply a shield from liability; for example, under the [[German law]] of "[[Duty to rescue#Germany|Unterlassene Hilfeleistung]]" (an offense not to provide first aid when necessary), a citizen is obliged to provide first aid when necessary and is immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith turns out to be harmful. In Canada, all provinces with the exception of Quebec operate on the basis of [[English Common Law]].  Quebec operates a civil law system, based in part on the [[Napoleonic Code]], and the principle of duty to rescue does apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=Canadian Law website 2|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>. Similarly, in France anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims <ref>Audrey Laur Liabilities of Doctors on Aircraft Med Leg J March 2013 81:31—35</ref>.

To illustrate a variation in the concept of duty to rescue, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides all workers with the right to refuse to perform unsafe work.  There are, however, specific exceptions to this right.  When the "life, health or safety of another person is at risk," then specific groups, including "police officers, firefighters, or employees of a hospital, clinic or other type of medical worker (including EMS)" are specifically excluded from the right to refuse unsafe work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/1b20e47b-33e4-49e7-a525-b268f053d236/4/frame/?search=browseStatutes&context=|title=Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. (1990) (Ontario E-laws website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
A Good Samaritan law was featured in the May 1998 [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] of the popular [[NBC]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'', in which the show's four main characters were all prosecuted and sentenced to one year in jail for making fun of (rather than helping) a fat man (John Pinette) who was getting robbed at gunpoint.<ref>{{cite news|title='Seinfeld' Goes Out in Self-Referential Style|date=1998-05-15|pages=B1|last=James|first=Caryn|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/15/arts/television-review-seinfeld-goes-out-in-self-referential-style.html|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> In reality, while [[Massachusetts]] (where the fictional crime was committed) does have a law requiring passersby to report a crime in progress, the most stringent punishment the characters could have suffered under those circumstances would have been a $500–2,500 fine  (assuming they were prosecuted under state law); however, the sentence could have resulted in the telling of all of the other horrible things described by the witnesses: In addition, the phrase "good Samaritan law," when used in Massachusetts, refers only to the civil law definition and does not have any actual relevance to the law under which [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] and his friends were prosecuted (which would be considered a [[duty to rescue]]).<ref name="seinfeldgoodsam">{{cite web | title=Footnote TV's Mirror Law analysis of the Seinfeld finale and Massachusetts' Good Samaritan Law| url=http://www.footnotetv.com/ftvseinfeldindex.html#goodsamaritan |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref>
