'''Risperidone''' ({{IPAc-en|r|i-|'|s|p|air|i-|d|oh|n}} {{Respell|ri|SPAIR|i-dohn}}) (trade name '''Risperdal''', and generics) is a potent [[antipsychotic]] drug which is mainly used to treat [[schizophrenia]] (including adolescent schizophrenia), [[schizoaffective disorder]], the mixed and manic states associated with [[bipolar disorder]], and irritability in people with [[autism]]. 

Risperidone belongs to the class of [[atypical antipsychotic]]s.<ref>{{cite pmid|21249678}}</ref> It is a [[dopamine antagonist]] possessing [[antiserotonergic]], [[antiadrenergic]] and [[antihistaminergic]] properties.

Side effects of risperidone include significant [[weight gain]] and metabolic problems, as well as [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. Risperidone and other antipsychotics also increase the risk of death in patients with dementia.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000944/ |title=Risperidone — PubMed Health |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> 

The drug was developed by [[Janssen-Cilag]], subsidiary of [[Johnson & Johnson]], and first released in 1994.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080907102602/http://www.naminh.org/resources-medications-treatments-medications-risperdal.php Risperdal (risperidone) at naminh.org/resources] (web archive)</ref> Today many [[generic drug|generic]] versions are available.

==Medical uses==
Risperidone is used for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]] and behavior problems in people with [[autism]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Respiridone|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/risperidone.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> In autism, however, it does not improve conversational ability or social skills, and does not appear to reduce obsessive behavior in most autistic people.<ref name=AHFS/>

Due to its strong serotonin, dopaminergic, and adrenergic antagonism, risperidone was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1993 for the treatment of schizophrenia.<ref>
{{cite web| title =Electronic Orange Book| publisher =Food and Drug Administration| month=April | year=2007| url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=020272&TABLE1=OB_Rx| accessdate =2007-05-24}}</ref> On August 22, 2007, risperidone was approved as the only drug agent available for treatment of schizophrenia in youths, ages 13–17; it was also approved that same day for treatment of bipolar disorder in youths and children, ages 10–17, joining [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. Risperidone contains the [[functional group]]s of [[benzisoxazole]] and [[piperidine]] as part of its molecular structure. Although not a butyrophenone, it was developed with the structures of [[benperidol]] and [[ketanserin]] as a basis. In 2003, the FDA approved risperidone for the short-term treatment of the mixed and manic states associated with bipolar disorder. In 2006, the FDA approved risperidone for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autism.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=FDA |date=October 6, 2006 |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108759.htm |title=FDA approves the first drug to treat irritability associated with autism, Risperdal |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> The FDA's decision was based in part on a study of autistic people with severe and enduring problems of violent meltdowns, aggression, and self-injury; risperidone is not recommended for autistic people with mild aggression and explosive behavior without an enduring pattern.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=1197–8 |title= How do I decide whether or not to use medication for my child with autism? should I try behavior therapy first? |author= Scahill L |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0573-7 |pmid=18463973}}</ref> Like other atypical antipsychotics, risperidone has also been used [[off-label]] for the treatment of anxiety disorders, such as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], severe, [[treatment-resistant depression]] with or without [[Psychotic depression|psychotic]] features, [[Tourette syndrome]], disruptive behavior disorders in children, and [[eating disorder]]s, among others. In two small studies, risperidone was reported to successfully treat the symptoms of [[phencyclidine]] psychosis due to acute intoxication<ref>{{cite journal | author = AJ Giannini, GL Colapietro, DK Cook | title = Risperidone therapy in phencyclidine intoxication | journal = Society for Neuroscience Abstracts | volume = 22 | issue = 77.12 | year = 1996}}</ref> and chronic use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gabbert JF, Giannini AJ |title=Clinical Therapeutic Conference: dopaminergic/serotonergic actions of phencyclidine as a model for schizophreniform psychosis |journal=Am J Ther |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=159–63 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=10423606 |doi = 10.1097/00045391-199704000-00008 }}</ref>

===Availability===
[[File:Risperdal tablets.jpg|thumb|Risperdal (risperidone) 4 mg tablets ([[United Kingdom|UK]])]]

Janssen's patent on risperidone expired on December 29, 2003, opening the market for cheaper [[Generic drug|generic versions]] from other companies, and Janssen's exclusive marketing rights expired on June 29, 2004 (the result of a pediatric extension).

Risperidone is available as a tablet, an oral solution, and an ampule, Risperdal Consta, which is a [[depot injection]] administered once every two weeks. It is also available as a wafer known in the United States and Canada as Risperdal M-Tabs and elsewhere as Risperdal Quicklets. Risperidone is also available as paliperidone IM injections (a risperidone derivative). This injection is given 12 times a year on the same day each month, and is longer-lasting and has better adherence in the community than Consta.

Risperidone became available as a generic drug in October 2008 from [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva Pharmaceuticals]], Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. and Patriot Pharmaceutics. The Patriot generic is Janssen Pharmaceutical's "authorized generic pharmaceutical". The drug is currently marketed in India under several brand names including Risperdal, Risdon and Sizodon.

==Adverse effects==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
The severity of adverse effects often depends on the dosage. Risperidone has been associated with [[weight gain]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Newcomer JW |title=Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics and metabolic effects: a comprehensive literature review |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=19 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=1–93 |year=2005 |pmid=15998156 }}</ref>  Other common side effects include [[akathisia]], [[anxiety]], [[sedation]], [[dysphoria]], [[insomnia]], [[hyperprolactinaemia|elevated prolactin level]], low [[blood pressure]], high [[blood pressure]], [[muscle]]  stiffness, [[muscle]] pain, [[tremor]]s, [[hypersalivation]], [[constipation]], and stuffy nose.{{medcn|date=February 2013}}  In addition, risperidone treatment causes [[photosensitivity]], and patients should be warned to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun or to use effective sunscreen (SPF 15+).{{medcn|date=February 2013}}  Other skin conditions have also been reported, including rash, [[xerosis]] (dry skin), [[acne vulgaris]], [[alopecia]] (hair loss), and [[seborrhea]].{{medcn|date=February 2013}}  At high doses, skin [[hyperpigmentation]] may also occur.<ref>Risperdal (risperidone) package insert. Titusville, NJ: Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, L.P.; 2010 Aug.</ref> [[Irritability]], [[aggression]], [[sleep disorder]]s and [[eating disorder]]s are also common due to the blocking action of serotonin and dopamine that risperidone produces.{{medcn|date=February 2013}} Also heart arrythmia, bradycardia and heart palpitations often occur.{{medcn|date=February 2013}}

Many antipsychotics are known to cause [[hyperprolactinemia]], which may lead to [[hypogonadism]]-induced [[osteoporosis]], [[galactorrhoea]] (unexpected female breast-milk production), [[gynaecomastia]] (male breast development), irregular menstruation and sexual dysfunction.{{medcn|date=February 2013}}

[[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] has been reported with risperidone, with at least two fatal cases reported.{{medcn|date=February 2013}}  [[Tardive dyskinesia]], an irreversible movement disorder, has also been reported with risperidone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hong KS, Cheong SS, Woo JM, Kim E |title=Risperidone-induced tardive dyskinesia |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=156 |issue=8 |pages=1290 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10450277 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/156/8/1290 }}</ref>

===Discontinuation===
The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=BMJ Group |title=British National Formulary |edition=57 |year=2009 |month=March |publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0260-535X |page=192 |chapter=4.2.1 |quote=Withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs after long-term therapy should always be gradual and closely monitored to avoid the risk of acute withdrawal syndromes or rapid relapse.}}</ref> Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor sites in the central nervous system, withdrawal symptoms can occur during abrupt or reduction in dosage that is too quick. Support groups provide resources and social support for those attempting to discontinue antipsychotics and other psychiatric medications.  Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of antipsychotics include sleeplessness for several days, nausea, [[emesis]], lightheadedness, [[diaphoresis]], [[dyskinesia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and [[anxiety]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = DR. | last2 = Staab | first2 = JP. | title = Quetiapine discontinuation syndrome | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/162/5/1020 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 5 | page = 1020 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.1020 | pmid = 15863814 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Michaelides | first1 = C. | last2 = Thakore-James | first2 = M. | last3 = Durso | first3 = R. | title = Reversible withdrawal dyskinesia associated with quetiapine | journal = Mov Disord | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 769–70 | month = Jun | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/mds.20427 | pmid = 15747370 }}</ref>  Some have argued the additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic super-sensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chouinard | first1 = G. | last2 = Jones | first2 = BD. | title = Neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis: clinical and pharmacologic characteristics | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=157922  |

==Pharmacology==
Risperidone has been classified as a "qualitatively atypical" antipsychotic agent with a relatively low incidence of [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] (when given at low doses) that has more pronounced serotonin antagonism than dopamine antagonism. Risperidone is unique among most other atypicals in that it has high affinity for the [[dopamine receptor D2|D2 receptor]] (also known as 'tight binding') whereas most other atypicals have 'loose binding' of the D2 receptor. It has actions at several 5-HT (serotonin) receptor subtypes. These are 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, linked to weight gain, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, linked to its antipsychotic action and relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects experienced with the typical neuroleptics.

It reaches peak [[blood plasma|plasma]] levels quickly, regardless of whether it is administered as a liquid or pill. Risperidone is [[metabolism|metabolized]] fairly quickly, so the potential for nausea subsides usually in two to three hours. However, the active metabolite, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, which has similar pharmacodynamics to risperidone, remains in the body for much longer, and has been developed as an antipsychotic in its own right, called [[paliperidone]].

An intramuscular preparation, marketed as Risperdal Consta, can be given once every two weeks. It is slowly released from the injection site. This method of administration may be used on sanctioned patients who are declining, or consenting patients who may have disorganized thinking and cannot remember to take their daily doses.<ref>[http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/psychopharmacology/a/antipsy_2.htm ''Antipsychotic Medications''], ''About.com: Mental Health'' May 30, 2006</ref>
Doses range from 12.5 to 50&nbsp;mg given as an intramuscular injection once every two weeks.

==Pharmacodynamics==
The main action of an antipsychotic (regardless of typical or atypical) is to decrease the action of [[dopamine]] and/or [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] levels in the brain. Because of the risk of developing pre-existing [[Parkinson's disease]] as a result of decreased dopaminergic levels in the brain, risperidone possesses effects similar to those of [[haloperidol]]. It is a highly potent dopaminergic antagonist for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, the risk of [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] are decreased only slightly because of the antagonism of the serotonin and α2 adrenergic receptors. Risperidone acts on the following receptors:

'''Dopamine receptors''' — The targets of this drug are the D1 (D1, and D5) as well as the D2 family (D2, D3 and D4) receptors. This drug has "tight binding" properties, which means it has a long half-life and like other antipsychotics, risperidone blocks the mesolimbic pathway, the prefrontal cortex and the limbic pathways in the central nervous system. Risperidone may induce extrapyramidal side effects, akathisia and tremors, associated with diminished dopaminergic activity in the [[striatum]]. It can also induce sexual side effects and weight gain, associated with increased prolactin secretion. Side effects may also include depression and anxiety disorders. At considerable higher doses, the drug appears to block the [[Substantia nigra]] dopamine pathway; therefore inducing extrapyramidal and Parkinson-like symptoms such as tremors and walking "hunched over"

'''Serotonin receptors''' — anxiolytic, sedative and antipsychotic properties. It may also increase appetite, leading to significant weight gain. Improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms and sexual side effects are also seen in patients. Risperidone possesses also antidepressant properties associated with decreased activity of 5HT2A and 5HT7 receptors.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Alpha α1 adrenergic receptors''' — Its diminished action of epinephrine and norepinephrine accounts for its sedation, anxiolytic effects, and smooth muscle relaxation.

'''Alpha α2 adrenergic receptors''' — decreased extrapyramidal symptoms; increased sympathetic tone is associated with the blocked action of the adrenergic α2 receptors. Also, it possesses antidepressant properties.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Histamine H1 receptors''' — effects on these receptors account for its sedation and reduction in vigilance. This may also lead to drowsiness and weight gain.

Though this medication possesses similar effects to other typical and atypical antipsychotics, it does not possess an affinity for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]]. In many respects, this medication can be useful as an "[[acetylcholine]] release-promoter" similar to gastrointestinal drugs such as [[metoclopramide]] and [[cisapride]].

==Controversy, lawsuits and settlements==
On 11 April 2012, Johnson & Johnson and its  subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., were fined about $1.2 billion by an Arkansas judge.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-risperdal-arkansas-20120411,0,3974735.story ''Companies belittled risks of Risperdal, slapped with huge fine'']</ref> The jury found the companies had downplayed multiple risks associated with risperidone (Risperdal). The judge held that nearly 240,000 violations of the state's Medicaid fraud law had been committed. Each violation carried a fine of $5,000. The companies were also fined $11 million for more than 4,500 violations of the state’s deceptive practices laws.

According to an online report from the ''Wall Street Journal'' on June 20, 2012, "Johnson & Johnson and the Justice Department are close to settling a protracted investigation into the company’s promotion of the antipsychotic Risperdal, for what would be one of the highest sums to date in a drug-marketing case. The sides are trying to wrap together a number of lawsuits, state investigations and other probes of alleged illegal marketing, and are discussing a payment of $1.5 billion or higher."

In August 2012, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $181 million to 36 U.S. states in order to settle claims that it had promoted risperidone for non-approved uses including dementia, anger management, and anxiety.<ref>{{cite news|title=NY AG: Janssen pays $181M over drug marketing|author=|date=30 August 2012|newspaper=The Seattle Times|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2019027371_apusantipsychoticdrugsettlement.html}}</ref>
