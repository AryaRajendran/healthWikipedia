'''Fasciotomy''' or '''fasciectomy''' is a surgical procedure where the [[fascia]] is cut to relieve tension or pressure commonly to treat the resulting loss of [[circulatory system|circulation]] to an area of [[biological tissue|tissue]] or [[muscle]].<ref name="problems">{{cite journal |author=Dente CJ, Wyrzykowski AD, Feliciano DV |title=Fasciotomy |journal=Current Problems in Surgery |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=779â€“839 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19735797 |doi=10.1067/j.cpsurg.2009.04.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0011-3840(09)00056-2 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>  Fasciotomy is a limb-saving procedure when used to treat acute [[compartment syndrome]].  It is also sometimes used to treat chronic compartment stress syndrome. The procedure has a very high rate of success, with the most common problem being accidental damage to a nearby nerve.

==Complications==
A delay in performing the procedure can lead to neurovascular complications or lead to the need for [[amputation]] of a limb.<ref name=problems/> Complications can also involve the formation of scar tissue after the operation. A thickening of the surgical scars can result in the loss of mobility of the joint involved. This can be addressed through occupational or physical therapy.

==Process==
Fasciotomy in the limbs is usually performed by a surgeon under general or regional anesthesia. An incision is made in the skin, and a small area of fascia is removed where it will best relieve pressure. 

Plantar fasciotomy is an [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] procedure. The physician makes two small incisions on either side of the heel. An endoscope is inserted in one incision to guide the physician. A tiny knife is inserted in the other. A portion of the fascia near the heel is removed. The incisions are then closed.

In addition to scar formation, there is a possibility that the surgeon may need to use a skin graft to close the wound. Sometimes when closing the fascia again in another surgical procedure, the muscle is still too large to close it completely. A small bulge is visible, but is not harmful.

==Indications==
[[Compartment syndrome]] is one of the conditions where a fasciotomy may be indicated. People who are likely to suffer injuries needing a fasciotomy include the following:
* Victims of vehicular accidents or [[Crush injury|crush injuries]]<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001224.htm</ref>
* Athletes who have sustained one or more serious impact injuries
* People with severe burns
* Persons who are severely overweight
