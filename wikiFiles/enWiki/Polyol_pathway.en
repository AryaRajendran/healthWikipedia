Also called the '''[[sorbitol]]-[[aldose]] [[reductase]] pathway''', the [[polyol]] pathway appears to be implicated in diabetic complications, especially in microvascular damage to the [[retina]], [[kidney]],<ref name="Forbes">{{cite journal | last=Forbes | first=JM | coauthors=Coughlan MT, Cooper ME | title=Oxidative stress as a major culprit in kidney disease in diabetes | journal=Diabetes | volume=57 | issue=6 | pages=1446–1454 | month=June | year=2008 | url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/57/6/1446 | pmid=18511445 | doi=10.2337/db08-0057 }}</ref> and [[nerves]].<ref>http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/</ref>

Sorbitol cannot cross [[cell membranes]], and, when it accumulates, it produces [[osmotic]] stresses on cells by drawing water into the insulin-independent tissues.<ref>Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Vol 20, 314-326, Copyright © 1981 by Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology</ref>

== Pathway ==
Cells use [[glucose]] for [[energy]]; however, unused glucose enters the [[polyol]] pathway when [[aldose reductase]] reduces it to sorbitol. This reaction oxidizes [[NADPH]] to [[NADP+]]. [[Sorbitol dehydrogenase]] can then oxidize sorbitol to [[fructose]], which produces [[NADH]] from [[NAD+]]. [[Hexokinase]] can return the molecule to the [[glycolysis]] pathway by [[phosphorylating]] [[fructose]] to form fructose-6-phosphate. However, in uncontrolled diabetics that have high [[blood glucose]] - more than the [[glycolysis]] pathway can handle - the reaction's [[mass balance]] ultimately favors the production of sorbitol.
 
Activation of the [[polyol]] pathway results in a decrease of reduced [[NADPH]] and oxidized [[NAD+]]; these are necessary cofactors in [[redox]] reactions throughout the body. The decreased concentration of these [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s leads to decreased synthesis of [[reduced glutathione]], [[nitric oxide]], [[myo-inositol]], and [[taurine]]. Myo-inositol is particularly required for the normal function of nerves. Sorbitol may also glycate [[nitrogen]]s on [[proteins]], such as [[collagen]], and the products of these glycations are referred-to as AGEs - [[advanced glycation endproducts]].  AGEs are thought to cause disease in the human body, one effect of which is mediated by RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) and the ensuing inflammatory responses induced. They are seen in the hemoglobin A1C tests performed on known diabetics to assess their levels of glucose control.

== Pathology ==
While most [[Cell (biology)|cells]] require the action of [[insulin]] for glucose to gain entry into the cell, the cells of the [[retina]], [[kidney]], and nervous tissues are insulin-independent, so glucose moves freely across the [[cell membrane]], regardless of the action of insulin. The cells will use glucose for energy as normal, and any glucose not used for energy will enter the [[polyol]] pathway. When [[blood glucose]] is normal (about 100 [[mg/dl]] or 5.5&nbsp;mmol/l), this interchange causes no problems, as aldose reductase has a low [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for glucose at normal [[concentrations]]. 

In a hyperglycemic state, the [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of aldose reductase for glucose rises, causing much sorbitol to accumulate, and using much more [[NADPH]], leaving less [[NADPH]] for other processes of [[cellular metabolism]].<ref name="BrownleeNature2001">{{cite journal | author=Brownlee M | title=Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology of Diabetic Complications | journal=Nature | year=2001 | pages=813–820 | volume=414 | issue=6865 | pmid= 11742414 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7246/1373 | doi=10.1038/414813a}}</ref>  This change of [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] is what is meant by activation of the pathway. In essence, the  [[Fructose]] does the same thing. The amount of sorbitol that accumulates, however, may not be sufficient to cause osmotic influx of water.

The [[NADPH]] acts to promote [[nitric oxide]] and [[glutathione]] production, and its deficiency will cause glutathione deficiency as well. A [[glutathione deficiency]], [[congenital]] or acquired, can lead to [[hemolysis]] caused by [[oxidative stress]]. [[Nitric oxide]] is one of the important [[vasodilators]] in blood vessels. Therefore [[NADPH]] prevents [[reactive oxygen species]] from accumulating and damaging cells.

Excessive activation of the [[polyol]] pathway increases [[intracellular]] and [[extracellular]] sorbitol [[concentrations]], increased [[concentrations]] of [[reactive oxygen species]], and decreased [[concentrations]] of [[nitric oxide]] and [[glutathione]].  Each of these imbalances can damage cells; in [[diabetes]] there are several acting together.  It has not been conclusively determined that activating the [[polyol]] pathway damages microvasculature.
