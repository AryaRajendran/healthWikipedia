'''Oxygen  saturation''' or '''dissolved oxygen''' (DO) is a relative measure of the amount of [[oxygen]] that is [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolve]]d or carried in a given medium. It can be measured with a dissolved oxygen probe such as an [[oxygen sensor]] or an [[optode]] in liquid media, usually water. The standard unit is milligrams per litre (mg/l) or parts per million (ppm).

Oxygen saturation can be measured regionally and non-invasively. [[Artery|Arterial]] oxygenation is commonly measured using [[pulse oximetry]]. Tissue saturation at peripheral scale can be measured using [[near-infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]]. This technique can be applied on both muscle and brain.

==Oxygen  in medicine==
{{Main|Oxygenation (medical)}}
In [[medicine]], oxygen saturation refers to ''oxygenation'', or when [[oxygen]] molecules ({{chem|O|2}}) enter the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the body. In this case [[blood]] is oxygenated in the [[lung]]s, where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood. Oxygen saturation, or ({{chem|O|2}}) stats measure the percentage of [[hemoglobin]] binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen. Fish, invertebrates, plants, and aerobic bacteria all require oxygen for respiration. Blood is also vital to the body system.

==Environmental oxygen saturation==
{{Main|Oxygenation (environmental)}}
Oxygen saturation in the environment generally refers to the amount of oxygen dissolved in the soil or bodies of water. Environmental oxygenation can be important to the [[sustainability]] of a particular [[ecosystem]]. A well-mixed body of water will be fully saturated, with approximately 10mg/L at 15 Â°C ([http://water.epa.gov/type/rsl/monitoring/vms52.cfm here is a table of dissolved oxygen versus temperature]). The optimal levels in an estuary for Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is higher than 6 ppm. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Insufficient oxygen ([[hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]), often caused by the decomposition of organic matter, may occur in bodies of water such as [[pond]]s and [[river]]s, tending to suppress the presence of [[aerobic organism]]s such as [[fish]]. Deoxygenation increases the relative population of [[anaerobic organism]]s such as plants and some [[bacteria]], resulting in [[fish kill]]s and other adverse events. The net effect is to alter the [[balance of nature]] by increasing the concentration of anaerobic over aerobic [[species]].
