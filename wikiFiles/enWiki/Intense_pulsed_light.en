'''Intense pulsed light''', commonly abbreviated as '''IPL''', is a technology used by beauty studios and medical practitioners to perform various skin treatments including [[hair removal]] and [[photorejuvenation]]. The technology utilises specific wavelengths of light to target various chromophores in the skin.

==Definition==
''Intense pulsed light'' describes the use of intense [[Pulse (physics)|pulses]] of non-[[coherent light]] distributed over a range of [[wavelength]]s from 500&nbsp;nm to 1200&nbsp;nm, for removal of hair and other purposes.<ref name=IPLS>{{cite web|title=Intense Pulsed Light Systems|url=http://www.palomarmedical.com/uploaddocs/intense-pulsed-light-systems.pdf|publisher=HMP Communications|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>  A related but distinct technique is [[laser hair removal]]; the primary difference is that [[laser]] treatment uses laser-generated coherent and [[monochromatic]] light.

Regulations governing IPL and laser hair removal vary by jurisdiction.<ref name=DOH>{{cite web|title=Laser Information|url=http://www.doh.state.fl.us/MQA/medical/me_laser.html|publisher=Florida Department of Health|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

The two techniques are often confused. One cause of confusion is the range of names used for intense pulsed light treatments, as ''intense pulsed light'' is a registered trademark, which was strongly policed during the early days of the technology, hence the introduction of new names and trademarks for similar or identical treatments.<ref name=RB>{{cite web|title=Brisbane Hair Removal: IPL Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.reefbrisbane.com.au/brisbane-ipl-hair-removal.htm|publisher=Body Sync Group Pty Ltd|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}. IPL and equivalent treatments are referred to as I2PL, UPL, VPL, SPL, SPFT, SPTF, SIPL, PTF, CPL, AFT, E-Light, ELOS, M-Light, and other names.

A distinction is sometimes made between beauty-grade and medical-grade machines. This distinction is mainly to get around regulations.  Under the CE system no such distinction exists, it is all seen as medical devices.

===The hair growth cycle===
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
The focused, broad-[[light spectrum|spectrum]] [[light]] is applied to the surface of the [[skin]] by way of either a hand-held wand or an articulated arm. This light travels through the skin until it strikes the [[hair]] shafts or the bulb (root) of the hair. The bulb is usually where the highest concentration of [[melanin]] is located, as opposed to the rest of the hair shaft. As the light is converted to heat energy, the bulb and most of the hair shaft are instantly vaporized.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The intense heat radiated by the hair also destroys the hair-producing [[wikt:papilla|papilla]]. It is also claimed that direct light-heat conversion occurs directly in the darker colored capillaries that bring nourishing blood vessels to the follicle. Contrary to what is often claimed, photoepilation is not a permanent hair removal method but a permanent hair reduction method. This means that although IPL treatments with these devices will permanently reduce the total number of body hairs, they will not result in a permanent removal of all hair.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=A.|coauthors=Steinert, S.; Baeumler, W.; Landthaler, M.; Babilas, P.|title=Photoepilation with a diode laser vs. intense pulsed light (IPL): a randomized, intra-patient left-to-right trial|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|date=1 December 2012|pages=no|doi=10.1111/bjd.12182|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/bjd.12182}}</ref> The argument of permanent hair removal against permanent hair reductions is only of relevance in the USA because of the wording on the FDA certificate. 

At any one time, not all hair follicles are ‘active’, and only active hair follicles can be affected and destroyed by the treatment. ‘Inactive’ hair follicles can be treated as they become ‘active’ over time. For IPL treatments an average of 8-10 treatments are required to remove most visible hair.

===Contraindications===
Certain skin conditions, health irregularities, and medications can impact whether it is safe for a person to receive a light based hair removal treatment. This list applies to both IPL and conventional laser treatments.<ref name=contra>{{cite web|title=Contraindications for Laser and Pulsed Light Hair Removal|url=http://www.ajthompson.com.au/anatomy-contraindications-for-pulsed-light-hair-removal.htm|publisher=A J Thompson|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}
* Recent use of depilatory creams or sprays
* Recent waxing, plucking, or sugaring
* Contagious skin diseases: not always contraindicated but requires special preparation
* Herpes I and II in the area to be treated: not always contraindicated but requires special preparation
* Skin trauma, lesions, sores or open wounds
* Keloid or hypertrophic scarring
* Moles or [[skin cancer]]: treatment can blanch skin marks, making [[melanoma]] difficult to detect
* Sunburn
* Suntan, real or fake: hyperstimulates melanin in skin which provides a confusing target for light
* [[Epilepsy]] or other seizures potentially caused by flashing light
* [[Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome]] (PCOS): condition needs to be normalised with medication before treatment
* [[Hyperthyroidism]]: condition needs to be normalised with medication before treatment
* [[Breastfeeding]] and [[pregnancy]]: increased hormone levels greatly decrease treatment efficacy
* [[Hirsutism]]: not contraindicated but will require a greater number of treatments
* Tattoos or permanent makeup in area to be treated
* Photo-sensitising topical creams or medication: [[Tetracycline]], [[Minomycin]], [[Doxycycline]], St John's Wort, any citrus [[essential oils]]
* Black garments: can singe or combust if struck directly by the light flash
* Pain during treatment: if a person feels more than mild discomfort during treatment, the machine settings are wrong
* According to [[Remington Products|Remington]], manufacturer of an IPL hair remover, all IPL and laser devices should only be used on light to medium skin tones, and work best on darker hair.<ref>[http://uk.remington-europe.com/microsites/ilight-pro/dr-kubicka-i-light-ask-the-expert/ Remington Web site: i-Light Pro: Ask the expert]</ref>

===Treatment protocol===
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
No common treatment protocol exist and it depends on the equipment used and skin type of the patient/client. 
Commonly the treatment area needs to be clean, shaved and free of sunburn.  Treatment sessions are usually 4 to 6 weeks apart.

==Other uses==
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
IPL technology is employed in the treatment of medical disorders of the skin including:
* Sun damage induced dyspigmentation and vascular changes
* [[Poikiloderma of Civatte]]
* Acne [[Rosacea]]
* Broken capillaries/[[telangiectases]]
* Vascular Lesions (small blood vessels)
* Pigmented Lesions (freckles, [[liver spot]]s, [[birth mark]]s )
