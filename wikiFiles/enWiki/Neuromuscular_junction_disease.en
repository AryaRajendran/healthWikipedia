'''Neuromuscular junction disease''' is a medical condition where the normal conduction through the [[neuromuscular junction]] fails to function correctly.

==Autoimmune==
In diseases such as [[myasthenia gravis]], the End Plate Potential (EPP) fails to effectively activate the muscle fiber due to an [[autoimmune]] reaction against [[acetylcholine receptor]]s, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Hoch W, McConville J, Helms S, Newsom-Davis J, Melms A, Vincent A | title = Auto-antibodies to the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK in patients with myasthenia gravis without acetylcholine receptor antibodies | journal = Nat Med | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 365–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11231638 | doi = 10.1038/85520}}</ref>

Myasthenia gravis is caused most commonly by auto-antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor.  

It has recently been realized that a second category of gravis is due to auto-antibodies against [[MuSK]].

A different condition, [[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]], is usually associated with ''presynaptic'' antibodies to the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]].

It is possible for these conditions to coexist.<ref name="pmid17206662">{{cite journal |author=Sha SJ, Layzer RB |title=Myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in the same patient |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=115–7 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17206662 |doi=10.1002/mus.20735}}</ref>

==Toxins==
Various toxins, such as [[botulinum toxin]] prevent the release of acetylcholine, resulting in muscle [[paralysis]].
