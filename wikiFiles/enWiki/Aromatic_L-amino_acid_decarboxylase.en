'''Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase''' ({{EC number|4.1.1.28}}, synonyms: '''DOPA decarboxylase''', '''[[tryptophan]] [[decarboxylase]]''', '''5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase''', '''AAAD''') is a [[lyase]] [[enzyme]].

==Reactions==
It catalyzes several different [[decarboxylation]] reactions:
* [[L-DOPA]] to [[dopamine]] - a [[neurotransmitter]]
* [[5-HTP]] to [[serotonin]] (5-HT) - also a neurotransmitter
* [[tryptophan]] to [[tryptamine]] - a precursor to many [[alkaloids]] found in plants and animals

The enzyme uses [[pyridoxal phosphate]], the active form of vitamin B6, as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].

==As a rate-limiting step==
In normal [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] (5-HT) neurotransmitter synthesis, AAAD is not the [[rate-limiting step]] in either reaction. However, AAAD becomes the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis in patients treated with [[L-DOPA]] (such as in [[Parkinson's Disease]]), and the rate-limiting step of serotonin synthesis in people treated with [[5-HTP]] (such as in mild [[Clinical depression|depression]] or [[dysthymia]]).  AAAD is inhibited by [[Carbidopa]] outside of the [[blood brain barrier]] to inhibit the premature conversion of [[L-DOPA]] to [[Dopamine]] in the treatment of [[Parkinson's]].

AAAD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of [[biogenic]] [[trace amine]]s.
