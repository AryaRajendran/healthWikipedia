'''Puberty''' is the process of physical changes by which a [[child]]'s [[body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]] to enable [[fertilisation]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s; the [[ovary|ovaries]] in a girl, the [[testis|testes]] in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the [[brain]], [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ|sexual organs]]. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal, physical differences between boys and girls are the [[Sex organ#Human genitals|genitalia]], the [[human penis|penis]] and the [[vagina]].

Notable among the [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic]] changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, the "filling in" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man. Derived from the Latin ''puberatum'' (age of maturity), the word ''puberty'' describes the physical changes to sexual maturation, not the [[psychosocial]] and cultural maturation denoted by the term "adolescent development" in [[Western culture]], wherein [[adolescence]] is the period of mental transition from childhood to [[adult|adulthood]], which overlaps much of the body's period of puberty.<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', C.T. Onions ed. Oxford University Press 1996 p. 720.</ref>

==Differences between male and female puberty==
Two of the most significant differences between puberty in girls and puberty in boys are the age at which it begins, and the major [[sex steroid]]s involved.

For boys, an [[androgen]] called [[testosterone]] is the principal [[sex hormone]]. While testosterone produces all boys' changes characterized as [[virilization]], a substantial product of testosterone metabolism in males is estradiol. The conversion of testosterone to estradiol depends on the amount of body fat and estradiol levels in boys are typically much lower than in girls. The male "growth spurt" also begins later, accelerates more slowly, and lasts longer before the [[epiphyses]] fuse. Although boys are on average 2&nbsp;cm shorter than girls before puberty begins, adult men are on average about 13&nbsp;cm (5.2&nbsp;inches) taller than women. Most of this sex difference in adult heights is attributable to a later onset of the growth spurt and a slower progression to completion, a direct result of the later rise and lower adult male levels of estradiol.<ref name=abbassi1998>{{Cite journal|pmid=9685454|year=1998|last1=Abbassi|first1=V|title=Growth and normal puberty.|volume=102|issue=2 Pt 3|pages=507–513|journal=Pediatrics}}</ref>

The hormone that dominates female development is an [[estrogen]] called [[estradiol]]. While estradiol promotes growth of breasts and [[uterus]], it is also the principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and [[epiphyses|epiphyseal]] maturation and closure.<ref name=macgillivray1998>{{Cite journal|pmid=9554463|year=1998|last1=MacGillivray|first1=MH|last2=Morishima|first2=A|last3=Conte|first3=F|last4=Grumbach|first4=M|last5=Smith|first5=EP|title=Pediatric endocrinology update: an overview.

The hormonal maturation of females is considerably more complicated than in boys. The main [[steroid hormone]]s, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone as well as [[prolactin]] play important physiological functions in puberty.
Gonadal steroidgenesis in girls starts with production of testosterone which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However the rate of conversion from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of [[secondary sexual characteristics]]. Production of progesterone in the ovaries begins with the development of ovulatory cycles in girls (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of [[progesterone]] are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls.

==Puberty onset==
Puberty is preceded by [[adrenarche]], marking an increase of adrenal androgen production between ages 6-10. Adrenarche is  sometimes accompanied by the early appearance of axillary and pubic hair. The first androgenic hair resulting from adrenarche can be also transient and disappear before the onset of true puberty.

The onset of puberty is associated with high [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] pulsing, which precedes the rise in sex hormones, [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]].<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=11232044|doi=10.1210/jc.86.1.459|year=2001|last1=Plant|first1=T.M.|title=Leptin, growth hormone, and the onset of primate puberty.|volume=86|issue=1|pages=458–460|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism}}</ref> Exogenous GnRH pulses cause the onset of puberty.<ref>Essential Reproduction, M Johnson, Blackwell Publishers, 6th Rev Ed edition (29 Jun 2007)</ref> Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature puberty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Precocious Puberty |publisher=MERCK |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch282/ch282h.html |date=May 16, 2008}}</ref>

The cause of the GnRH rise is unknown. [[Leptin]] might be the cause of the GnRH rise. Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes GnRH.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=11458889|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1681.2001.03493.x|year=2001|last1=Meister|first1=B|last2=Håkansson|first2=ML|title=Leptin receptors in hypothalamus and circumventricular organs.|volume=28|issue=7|pages=610–617|journal=Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology}}</ref> Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate puberty.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=10868988|pmc=1718397|doi=10.1136/adc.83.1.1|year=2000|last1=Clayton|first1=PE|last2=Trueman|first2=JA|title=Leptin and puberty.|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–4|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood}}</ref> The levels of leptin increase with the onset of puberty, and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed.

==Physical changes in boys==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
{{seealso|Tanner scale}}
===Testicular size, penis size, fertility===
In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed [[gonadarche]]).<ref>Styne (2002), p. 598</ref> [[Testes]] in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2–3&nbsp;cm in length and about 1.5–2&nbsp;cm in width. The size of the testicles is among the parameters of the [[Tanner_scale#Genitals_.28male.29|tanner scale for male genitals]], from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a testicular volume of greater than 20 ml. Testicular size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty. After the boy's testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the [[human penis|penis]] will increase and the [[glans penis]] and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions.<ref name=jonessmiths>{{Cite book|author=Jones, Kenneth W.|title=Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo|year=2006|pages=|isbn=0-7216-0615-6}}</ref> While 18–20 cm<sup>3</sup> is an average adult size, there is wide variation in testicular size in the normal population.<ref>Marshall (1986), p. 180.</ref>

The testes have two primary functions: to produce [[hormone]]s and to produce [[spermatozoon|sperm]]. The [[Leydig cell]]s produce [[testosterone]], which in turn produces most of the male pubertal changes. Most of the increasing bulk of testicular tissue is spermatogenic tissue (primarily [[Sertoli cell|Sertoli]] and [[Leydig cell]]s). Sperm can be detected in the morning urine of most boys after the first year of pubertal changes, and occasionally earlier{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. On average, potential fertility in boys is reached at 13 years old, but full fertility will not be gained until 14–16 years of age{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

During puberty, a male's scrotum will become larger and begin to dangle or hang below the body as opposed to being up tight. This is to accommodate the testicles to hang lower whereby the testicles need a certain temperature to be fertile and produce sperm. This is colloquially referred to as ''"balls dropping"''.

===Morning wood and random or unwanted erections===
[[Erection]]s during sleep or when waking up are medically known as [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] and colloquially referred to as ''morning wood''.<ref>http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/A12219374</ref> The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake-up with an erection.<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&pg=PA149&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u1TwTu20EYTc8QOEmPiiAQ&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=&f=false</ref> Once a [[boy]] reaches his [[teenage]] years, erections occur much more frequently due to puberty.<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R0eixKqC0SgC&pg=PA119&dq=erection+puberty&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AFbwTvSeNonu8APewbW8AQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=erection%20puberty&f=false</ref> Erections can occur spontaneously at any time of day, and if clothed may cause a bulge or "hump".

===Foreskin retraction===
During puberty, if not before, the tip and opening of a boy's [[foreskin]] becomes wider, progressively allowing for retraction down the shaft of the [[Human penis|penis]] and behind the [[glans penis|glans]], which ultimately should be possible without pain or difficulty. The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the foreskin with the glans disintegrates and releases the foreskin to separate from the glans. The foreskin then gradually becomes retractable.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/ |title=Normal development of the prepuce: Birth through age 18|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

Research by Øster (1968) found that with the onset and continuation of puberty, the proportion of boys able to pull-back their foreskins increased. At ages 12–13, Øster found that only 60% of boys were able to retract their foreskins; this increased to 85% by ages 14–15, and 95% by 16–17. He also found that 1% of those unable to fully retract suffered from [[phimosis]] at ages 14–17, the remainder were partially able to.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further Fate of the Foreskin Incidence of Preputial Adhesions, Phimosis, and Smegma among Danish Schoolboys |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/general/oster/ |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=43 |pages=200–202 | date=April 1968 |first=Jakob |last=Øster |publisher=Department of Paediatrics, Central Hospital, Randers, Denmark |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |  doi = 10.1136/adc.43.228.200|pmid=5689532 |pmc=2019851}}</ref> The findings were supported by further research by Kayaba ''et al'' (1996) on a sample of over 600 boys,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/kayaba/ |journal= Journal of Urology |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=1813–1815 |date=November 1996 |publisher=American Urological Association, Inc. |title= Analysis of Shape and Retractability of the Prepuce in 603 Japanese Boys | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)65544-7 |pmid=8863623 |first=Hiroyuki |last=Kayaba |others=Hiromi Tamura, Seiichi Kitajima, Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, Tetsuo Kato and Tetsuro Kato}}</ref> and Ishikawa and Kawakita (2004) found that by age 15, 77% of their sample of boys could retract their foreskins.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/ishikaya1/ |last1=Ishikawa |first1= E. |last2=  Kawakita |first2=M. |title=Preputial development in Japanese boys |journal= Hinyokika Kiyo |year= 2004 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=305–8}}</ref>

Once a boy is able to retract his foreskin, penile hygiene should become an important feature of his routine body care. Although the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] states there is "little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene",<ref>{{cite journal |title=Circumcision Policy Statement |journal=Pediatrics |volume=103 |issue=3 |pages=686–93 |year=1999 |pmid=10049981 |doi=10.1542/peds.103.3.686}}</ref> various studies suggest that boys be educated about the role of hygiene, including retracting the foreskin while urinating and rinsing under it and around the glans at each bathing opportunity. Regular washing under the foreskin was found by Krueger and Osborn (1986) to reduce the risk of numerous penile disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krueger |first1=H |last2=Osborn |first2=L |title=Effects of hygiene among the uncircumcised. |journal=The Journal of family practice |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |year=1986 |pmid=3958682}}</ref>

===Pubic hair===
[[Pubic hair]] often appears on a boy shortly after the genitalia begin to grow.  The pubic hairs are usually first visible at the dorsal (abdominal) base of the penis. The first few hairs are described as stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too many to count. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the "pubic triangle." Stage 5 refers to the spread of pubic hair to the [[thigh]]s and upward towards the [[navel]] as part of the developing [[abdominal hair]].

===Body and facial hair===
[[Image:Stubbly face.jpg|right|thumb|120px|[[Facial hair]] of a male.]]
In the months and years following the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop [[androgenic hair]]. The usual sequence is: [[underarm]] (axillary) hair, [[perianal hair]], [[moustache|upper lip hair]], [[sideburn]] (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the [[beard]] area.<ref name="pamf.org">{{Cite news|title=Puberty -- Changes for Males|publisher=pamf.org|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html}}</ref> As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Arm, leg, [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdominal]], and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups.<ref name="Chumlea"/> Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, but may not appear until significantly later.<ref name="www.ppwr">{{Cite web|title=Getting The Facts: Puberty|publisher=ppwr|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html}}</ref><ref name="pbskids.org">{{Cite news|title=The No-Hair Scare|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/body/puberty/article7.html}}</ref> Facial hair will continue to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.<ref name=www.ppwr/> Some men do not develop full facial hair for up to 10 years after the completion of puberty.<ref name=www.ppwr/> Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after.<ref name=Chumlea/> Not all men have chest hair.

===Voice change and Adam's apple===
{{redirect|Squeaky-voiced teen|the fictional character|Squeaky-Voiced Teen (The Simpsons)}}
{{main|Voice break}}
<!-- This section is linked from [[List of voice disorders]] -->
Under the influence of androgens, the voice box, or [[larynx]], [[Laryngeal prominence|grows]] in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in boys, causing the male voice to drop and deepen, sometimes abruptly but rarely "overnight," about one [[octave]], because the longer and thicker [[vocal folds]] have a lower [[fundamental frequency]]. Before puberty, the larynx of boys and girls is about equally small.<ref name="www.britannica.com">{{Cite news|title=The structure of the larynx|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559032/speech/68966/The-structure-of-the-larynx}}</ref> Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Most of the voice change happens during stage 3-4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth. Full adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years.

===Male musculature and body shape===
By the end of puberty, adult men have heavier [[bone]]s and nearly twice as much skeletal [[muscle]]. Some of the bone growth (e.g. shoulder width and jaw) is disproportionately greater, resulting in noticeably different male and female skeletal shapes. The average adult male has about 150% of the lean body mass of an average female, and about 50% of the body fat.

This muscle develops mainly during the later stages of puberty, and muscle growth can continue even after boys are biologically adult. The peak of the so-called "strength spurt", the rate of muscle growth, is attained about one year after a male experiences his peak growth rate.

Often, the fat pads of the male breast tissue and the male nipples will develop during puberty; sometimes, especially in one breast, this becomes more apparent and is termed [[gynecomastia]]. It is usually not a permanent phenomenon.

===Body odor and acne===
Rising levels of androgens can change the fatty acid composition of perspiration, resulting in a more "adult" body odor. As in girls, another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil (sebum) from the skin and the resultant variable amounts of acne. Acne can not be prevented or diminished easily, but it typically fully diminishes at the end of puberty. However, it is not unusual for a fully grown adult to suffer the occasional bout of acne, though it is normally less severe than in adolescents. Some may desire using prescription topical creams or ointments to keep acne from getting worse, or even oral medication, due to the fact that acne is emotionally difficult and can cause scarring.

The first physical sign of puberty in girls is usually a firm, tender lump under the center of the [[areola]] of one or both [[breast]]s, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age.<ref name="Marshall187">Marshall (1986), p. 187</ref> This is referred to as [[thelarche]]. By the widely used [[Tanner stages|Tanner staging]] of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within six to 12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and [[nipple]]s forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.<ref name="Marshall188">Marshall (1986), p. 188</ref>

===Pubic hair===
[[Pubic hair]] is often the second noticeable change in puberty, usually within a few months of thelarche.<ref name=tanner85>{{Cite journal|pmid=3875704 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(85)80501-1|year=1985|last1=Tanner|first1=JM|last2=Davies|first2=PS|title=Clinical longitudinal standards for height and height velocity for North American children.|volume=107|issue=3|pages=317–329|journal=The Journal of pediatrics}}</ref> It is referred to as [[pubarche]]. The pubic hairs are usually visible first along the [[labium (genitalia)|labia]]. The first few hairs are described as Tanner stage 2.<ref name="Marshall188"/> Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too numerous to count and appear on the [[mons pubis|pubic mound]] as well. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the "pubic triangle." Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the [[thigh]]s and sometimes as [[abdominal hair]] upward towards the [[navel]]. In about 15% of girls, the earliest pubic hair appears before breast development begins.<ref name=tanner85/>

===Vagina, uterus, ovaries===
Perineal skin keratinizes due to effect of estrogen increasing its resistance to infection. The [[mucous membrane|mucosal surface]] of the [[vagina]] also changes in response to increasing levels of [[estrogen]], becoming thicker and duller pink in color (in contrast to the brighter red of the prepubertal vaginal mucosa).<ref>Gordon (2005), p. 151</ref> Mucosa changes into a multilayered structure with superficial layer of squamous cells. Estrogen increase glycogen content in vaginal epithelium, which in future plays important part in maintaining [[Vagina#pH|vaginal pH]]. Whitish secretions (physiologic [[leukorrhea]]) are a normal effect of estrogen as well.<ref name="Marshall187"/> In the two years following thelarche, the [[uterus]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and the [[ovarian follicle|follicles]] in the ovaries increase in size.<ref name="Marshall1867">Marshall (1986), p. 186–7</ref> The ovaries usually contain small follicular [[cyst]]s visible by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].<ref>Rosenfield (2002), p. 462</ref><ref name="pmid1584537">{{Cite journal|pmid=1584537|year=1992|last1=Siegel|first1=MJ|last2=Surratt|first2=JT|title=Pediatric gynecologic imaging.|volume=19|issue=1|pages=103–127|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America}}</ref> Before puberty, uterine body to cervix ratio is 1:1; which increases to 2:1 or 3:1 after completion of pubertal period.

===Menstruation and fertility===
The first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual bleeding]] is referred to as [[menarche]], and typically occurs about two years after [[thelarche]].<ref name=tanner85/> The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the [[United States]].<ref name="U.S. menarche"/> Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In [[Canada]], the average age of menarche is 12.72,<ref name="Canadian menarche"/> and in the [[United Kingdom]] it is 12.9.<ref name="UK menarche"/> The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular in the first two years after menarche.<ref name=apter80>{{Cite journal|pmid=6249519|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x|year=1980|last1=Apter|first1=D|title=Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study.|volume=12|issue=2|pages=107–120|journal=Clinical endocrinology}}</ref> [[Ovulation]] is necessary for [[fertility]], but may or may not accompany the earliest menses.<ref>Marshall (1986), p. 196-7</ref> In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year.<ref name=apter80>{{Cite journal|pmid=6249519|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x|year=1980|last1=Apter|first1=D|title=Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study.|volume=12|issue=2|pages=107–120|journal=Clinical endocrinology}}</ref> Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable.

===Body shape, fat distribution, and body composition===
During this period, also in response to rising levels of estrogen, the lower half of the [[pelvis]] and thus [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]] widen (providing a larger [[birth canal]]).<ref name="Marshall188"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/anatomy.html |title=Hips widen during female puberty  |publisher=Columbia}}</ref> Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty. On average, at 10 years, girls have 6% more body fat than boys.<ref>Gungor (2002), pages 699-700</ref>

===Body odor and acne===
Rising levels of [[androgen]]s can change the [[fatty acid]] composition of [[perspiration]], resulting in a more "adult" [[body odor]]. This often precedes thelarche and pubarche by one or more years. Another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil ([[sebum]]) from the skin. This change increases the susceptibility to [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], a skin condition that is characteristic of puberty.<ref name="ros2002">Rosenfield (2002){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Acne varies greatly in its severity.<ref name=ros2002/>

===Other effects of hormonal changes===
Estradiol in girls causes thickening of lips and [[oral mucosa]] as well as further development of the [[vulva]]. In the vulva and vagina estradiol causes thickening (stratification) of the skin, growth of the myopethelial layer and smooth muscle of the vagina. Typically estradiol will also cause pronounced growth of the [[labia minora]] and to a lesser degree of the [[labia majora]].

Estradiol is also responsible for the increased production of [[pheomelanin]], resulting in the characteristic red color of the lips, labia minora and sometimes labia majora. Estradiol together with other ovarian steroids also cause the darker coloration of the [[areola]]. 

Testosterone will cause an enlargement of the [[clitoris]] and possibly has important effects on the growth and maturation of the [[vestibular bulbs]], [[corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpus cavernosum of the clitoris]] and [[urethral sponge]].<ref>{{cite pmid| 8370691}}</ref>

Changes of the vulva initiated by estradiol as well as its direct effects also appear to influence the functioning of the lower urinary tract.<ref>{{cite pmid|15602011}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|21661025}}</ref>

==Variations==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}

===Timing of the onset of puberty===
The definition of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.). A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person's body.<ref name="nlm.nih.gov">{{Cite news|title=Puberty and adolescence|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=2010-07-30|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm}}</ref> These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes.

The age at which puberty begins varies between individuals; usually, puberty begins between 10 and 13 years of age. The age at which puberty begins is affected by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state and social circumstances.<ref name=Chumlea/><ref name="ncbi">{{cite journal |last1=Kaplowitz |first1=PB |last2=Slora |first2=EJ |last3=Wasserman |first3=RC |last4=Pedlow |first4=SE |last5=Herman-Giddens |first5=ME |title=Earlier onset of puberty in girls: relation to increased body mass index and race. |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=347–53 |year=2001 |pmid=11483799 |doi=10.1542/peds.108.2.347}}</ref> An example of social circumstances is the [[Vandenbergh effect]]; a juvenile female who has significant interaction with adult males will enter puberty earlier than juvenile females who are not socially overexposed to adult males.<ref>Nelson RJ. 2005. Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts. p357.</ref>

The average age at which puberty begins may be affected by race as well. For example, the average age of [[menarche]] in various populations surveyed has ranged from 12<ref name="U.S. menarche"/><ref name="Canadian menarche"/><ref name="UK menarche"/> to 18 years. The earliest average onset of puberty is for African-American girls and the latest average onset for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia. However, much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet. The median age of menarche for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished girls in the population, and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population.

Researchers have identified an earlier age of the onset of puberty.  However, they have based their conclusions on a comparison of data from 1999 with data from 1969.  In the earlier example, the sample population was based on a small sample of white girls (200, from Britain).  The later study identified as puberty as occurring in 48% of African-American girls by age nine, and 12% of white girls by that age.<ref>{{Cite news| title =Early Puberty in Girls| url = http://www.center4research.org/2010/04/girls-to-women/| accessdate = 2010-07-13 |year=2009|month=May|last=Zuckerman|first=Diana| publisher=National Research Center for Women and Families}}</ref>

One possible cause of a delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is [[Kallmann syndrome]], a form of [[hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated with a lack of sense of smell ([[anosmia]]).  Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in [[HPG axis]] at puberty which results in low or zero [[gonadotropin]] ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary [[hypogonadism]] and [[infertility]].<ref name="pmid21511493">{{cite journal |author=Mitchell AL, Dwyer A, Pitteloud N, Quinton R |title=Genetic basis and variable phenotypic expression of Kallmann syndrome: towards a unifying theory. |journal=Trends Endocrinol Metab. |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=249–58 |year=2011 |pmid=21511493}}</ref><ref>Oxford Endocrinology Library.

====Historical shift====
The average age at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Finley|coauthors=|title=Average age at menarche in various cultures|date=|publisher=Museum of Menstruation and Women s Health|url=http://www.mum.org/menarage.htm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Whincup |first1=P H |last2=Gilg |first2=JA |last3=Odoki |first3=K |last4=Taylor |first4=SJ |last5=Cook |first5=DG |title=Age of menarche in contemporary British teenagers: survey of girls born between 1982 and 1986 |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7294 |pages=1095–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11337438 |pmc=31261 |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7294.1095}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=|last=|coauthors=|title=Girls maturing slightly earlier|date=2001-05-03|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1310280.stm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=}}</ref> This was dubbed 'the secular trend' by J.M. Tanner. In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European females. In [[Norway]], girls born in 1840 had their menarche at an average age of 17 years. In France, the average in 1840 was 15.3 years. In [[England]], the average in 1840 was 16.5 years. In [[Japan]] the decline happened later and was then more rapid: from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.

A 2006 study in Denmark found  that puberty, as evidenced by breast development, started at an average age of 9 years and 10 months, a year earlier than when a similar study  was done in 1991.  Scientists believe the phenomenon could be linked to obesity or exposure to chemicals in the food chain, and is putting girls at greater long-term risk of breast cancer.<ref>

===Genetic influence and environmental factors===
Various studies have found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46% of the variation of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations.<ref name="xia">{{Cite journal|last1=Ge|first1=Xiaojia|last2=Natsuaki|first2=Misaki N.|last3=Neiderhiser|first3=Jenae M.|last4=Reiss|first4=David|title=Genetic and Environmental Influences on Pubertal Timing: Results From Two National Sibling Studies|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=17|pages=767|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00546.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=15535766|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1188|year=2004|last1=Mustanski|first1=BS|last2=Viken|first2=RJ|last3=Kaprio|first3=J|last4=Pulkkinen|first4=L|last5=Rose|first5=RJ|title=Genetic and environmental influences on pubertal development: longitudinal data from Finnish twins at ages 11 and 14.|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1188–1198|journal=Developmental psychology}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=2349942|pmc=1683767|year=1990|last1=Treloar|first1=SA|last2=Martin|first2=NG|title=Age at menarche as a fitness trait: nonadditive genetic variance detected in a large twin sample.|volume=47|issue=1|pages=137–148|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=8543288|year=1995|last1=Kaprio|first1=J|last2=Rimpelä|first2=A|last3=Winter|first3=T|last4=Viken|first4=RJ|last5=Rimpelä|first5=M|last6=Rose|first6=RJ|title=Common genetic influences on BMI and age at menarche.|volume=67|issue=5|pages=739–753|journal=Human biology; an international record of research}}</ref> The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters.

Researchers<ref>Diana Zuckerman, "When Little Girls Become Women: Early Onset of Puberty in Girls" (This article appeared in The Ribbon, a newsletter of the Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in New York States (BCERF), Vol 6, No. 1, Winter 2001.) http://www.center4research.org/2010/04/girls-to-women/</ref> have hypothesized that early puberty onset may be caused by certain hair care products containing estrogen or placenta, and by certain chemicals, namely [[phthalate]]s, which are used in many cosmetics, toys, and plastic food containers.

If genetic factors account for half of the variation of pubertal timing, environment factors are clearly important as well. One of the first observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes. The most important of the environmental influences is clearly nutrition, but a number of others have been identified, all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more clearly than male puberty.

====Hormones and steroids====
There is theoretical concern, and animal evidence, that environmental hormones and [[chemical]]s may affect aspects of prenatal or postnatal sexual development in humans.<ref>, T., Dumanoski, D. and Myers, J.P. Our Stolen Future, 1996, Plume: New York.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Large amounts of incompletely metabolized estrogens and [[progestagen]]s from pharmaceutical products are excreted into the sewage systems of large cities, and are sometimes detectable in the environment. [[Sex steroid]]s are sometimes used in cattle farming but have been banned in chicken meat production for 40 years. Although agricultural laws regulate use to minimize accidental human consumption, the rules are largely self-enforced in the United States. Significant exposure of a child to hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s could produce some or all of the changes of puberty.

Harder to detect as an influence on puberty are the more diffusely distributed environmental chemicals like PCBs ([[polychlorinated biphenyl]]), which can bind and trigger estrogen receptors.

More obvious degrees of partial puberty from direct exposure of young children to small but significant amounts of pharmaceutical sex steroids from exposure at home may be detected during medical evaluation for [[precocious puberty]], but mild effects and the other potential exposures outlined above would not.

[[Bisphenol A]] (BPA) is a chemical used to make plastics, and is frequently used to make baby bottles, water bottles, sports equipment, medical devices, and as a coating in food and beverage cans.  Scientists are concerned about BPA's behavioral effects on fetuses, infants, and children at current exposure levels because it can affect the prostate gland, mammary gland, and lead to early puberty in girls. BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen—an important reproduction and development regulator. It [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaches]] out of plastic into liquids and foods, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. population studied.  The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children. Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA, and BPA is more likely to leach out of plastic when its temperature is increased, as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.center4research.org/2010/04/are-bisphenol-a-bpa-plastic-products-safe-for-infants-and-children/ |title=Are Bisphenol A (BPA) Plastic Products Safe for Infants and Children? }}</ref>

====Nutritional influence====
[[Nutrition]]al factors are the strongest and most obvious environmental factors affecting timing of puberty.<ref name=xia/> Girls are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus. Surplus [[calorie]]s (beyond growth and activity requirements) are reflected in the amount of [[adipose|body fat]], which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility.

Much evidence suggests that for most of the last few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in childhood obesity have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.

Although available dietary energy (simple calories) is the most important dietary influence on timing of puberty, quality of the diet plays a role as well. Lower [[protein]] intakes and higher [[dietary fiber]] intakes, as occur with typical [[vegetarian diet]]s, are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty.

====Obesity influence and exercise====
Scientific researchers have linked early [[obesity]] with an earlier onset of puberty in girls.  They have cited obesity as a cause of breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years.<ref name="newscientist.com">{{Cite web|first=Phil|last=McKenna|title=Childhood obesity brings early puberty for girls|publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080419072722/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}</ref> Early puberty in girls can be a harbinger of later health problems.<ref>Molly, M. Ginty, [http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/3113 "US Girls' Early Puberty Attracts Research Flurry"], ''[[Women's eNews]]''</ref>

The average level of daily physical activity has also been shown to affect timing of puberty, especially in females. A high level of exercise, whether for athletic or body image purposes, or for daily subsistence, reduces energy calories available for reproduction and slows puberty. The exercise effect is often amplified by a lower body fat mass and cholesterol.

====Physical and mental illness====
Chronic diseases can delay puberty in both boys and girls. Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[tuberculosis]] have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while in areas of the underdeveloped world, chronic [[parasite]] [[infection]]s are widespread.

Mental illnesses occur in puberty. The brain undergoes significant development by [[hormone]]s which can contribute to mood disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[dysthymia]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Girls aged between 15 and 19 make up 40% of [[anorexia nervosa]] cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=15852310|year=2005|last1=Bulik|first1=CM|last2=Reba|first2=L|last3=Siega-riz|first3=AM|last4=Reichborn-kjennerud|first4=T|title=Anorexia nervosa: definition, epidemiology, and cycle of risk.|volume=37 Suppl|pages=S2–9; discussion S20–1|doi=10.1002/eat.20107|journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders}}</ref>

====Stress and social factors====
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2011}}
Some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological. In comparison with the effects of genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including [[pheromone]]s, have been suggested based on animal research.

The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged [[sexual abuse]] in childhood, or who are [[international adoption|adopted]] from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present.

More extreme degrees of environmental stress, such as wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival, have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy.

Most of these reported social effects are small and our understanding is incomplete. Most of these "effects" are statistical associations revealed by [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and a variety of covariables and alternative explanations can be imagined. Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child. Furthermore, interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.

Another limitation of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the [[menarche]] article.

===Variations of sequence===
The sequence of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of boys and girls, [[pubarche]] (the first pubic hairs) can precede, respectively, [[gonadarche]] and [[thelarche]] by a few months. Rarely, [[menarche]] can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.

===Conclusion===
In a general sense, the conclusion of puberty is reproductive maturity. Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes: attainment of the ability to reproduce, achievement of maximal adult height, maximal gonadal size, or adult sex hormone levels. Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 15 years for an average girl and 18 years for an average boy. Potential fertility (sometimes termed ''nubility'') usually precedes completion of growth by 1–2 years in girls and 3–4 years in boys. Stage 5 typically represents maximal gonadal growth and adult hormone levels.

==Neurohormonal process==
The endocrine [[reproductive]] system consists of the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland|pituitary]], the [[gonad]]s, and the [[adrenal gland]]s, with input and regulation from many other body systems. True puberty is often termed "central puberty" because it begins as a process of the [[central nervous system]]. A simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows:

#The brain's [[hypothalamus]] begins to release pulses of [[GnRH]].
#Cells in the [[anterior pituitary]] respond by secreting [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle stimulating hormone|FSH]] into the circulation.
#The [[ovary|ovaries]] or [[testes]] respond to the rising amounts of LH and FSH by growing and beginning to produce [[estradiol]] and [[testosterone]].
#Rising levels of estradiol and testosterone produce the body changes of female and male puberty.

The onset of this neurohormonal process may precede the first visible body changes by 1–2 years.

===Components of the endocrine reproductive system===

The '''[[arcuate nucleus]]''' of the '''[[hypothalamus]]''' is the driver of the reproductive system. It has [[neuron]]s which generate and release pulses of GnRH into the portal venous system of the [[pituitary gland]]. The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by neuronal input from other areas of the brain and hormonal input from the [[gonad]]s, [[adipose]] tissue and a variety of other systems.

The '''[[pituitary gland]]''' responds to the pulsed GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into the blood of the general circulation, also in a pulsatile pattern.

The '''gonads''' ([[testes]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]) respond to rising levels of LH and FSH by producing the [[steroid]] [[sex steroid|sex hormones]], [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]].

The '''[[adrenal gland]]s''' are a second source for steroid hormones. Adrenal maturation, termed [[adrenarche]], typically precedes gonadarche in mid-childhood.

===Major hormones===

*'''[[Neurokinin B]]''' (a [[tachykinin]] [[peptide]]) and '''[[kisspeptin]]''' (a [[neuropeptide]]), both present in the same [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] [[neuron]]s, are critical parts of the control system that switches on the release of GnRH at the start of puberty.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/ng.306|laysummary=http://esciencenews.com/articles/2008/12/11/key.regulation.puberty.discovered|laysource=e!

*'''[[GnRH]]''' ([[gonadotropin]]-releasing hormone) is a [[peptide]] [[hormone]] released from the [[hypothalamus]] which stimulates [[gonadotrope]] cells of the anterior [[pituitary gland|pituitary]].
*'''[[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]''' (luteinizing hormone) is a larger [[protein]] hormone secreted into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior [[pituitary gland]]. The main target cells of LH are the [[Leydig cell]]s of [[Testicle|testes]] and the [[theca cell]]s of the [[Ovary|ovaries]]. LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH, as LH levels increase about 25-fold with the onset of puberty, compared with the 2.5-fold increase of FSH.
*'''[[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]''' ([[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] stimulating hormone) is another protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by the [[gonadotrope]] cells of the anterior pituitary. The main target cells of FSH are the [[ovarian follicle]]s and the [[Sertoli cell]]s and [[spermatogenesis|spermatogenic]] tissue of the [[Testicle|testes]].
*'''[[Testosterone]]''' is a [[steroid]] hormone produced primarily by the [[Leydig cell]]s of the [[Testicle|testes]], and in lesser amounts by the [[theca cell]]s of the ovaries and the adrenal cortex. Testosterone is the primary mammalian [[androgen]] and the "original" [[anabolic steroid]]. It acts on [[androgen receptor]]s in responsive tissue throughout the body.
*'''[[Estradiol]]''' is a [[steroid]] hormone produced by [[aromatization]] of testosterone. Estradiol is the principal human [[estrogen]] and acts on [[estrogen receptor]]s throughout the body. The largest amounts of estradiol are produced by the [[granulosa cell]]s of the [[Ovary|ovaries]], but lesser amounts are derived from [[Testicle|testicular]] and [[Adrenal gland|adrenal]] testosterone.
*'''[[Adrenal gland|Adrenal]] [[androgen]]s''' are steroids produced by the [[zona reticulosa]] of the [[adrenal cortex]] in both sexes. The major adrenal androgens are [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], [[androstenedione]] (which are precursors of testosterone), and [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] which is present in large amounts in the [[blood]]. Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls.
*'''[[IGF1]]''' ([[insulin-like growth factor 1]]) rises substantially during puberty in response to rising levels of [[growth hormone]] and may be the principal mediator of the pubertal growth spurt.
*'''[[Leptin]]''' is a protein hormone produced by [[adipose tissue]]. Its primary target organ is the [[hypothalamus]]. The leptin level seems to provide the [[brain]] a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of [[appetite]] and [[energy metabolism]]. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.

===Endocrine perspective===
The [[endocrine system|endocrine reproductive system]] becomes functional by the end of the first [[Pregnancy|trimester]] of fetal life. The testes and ovaries become briefly inactive around the time of birth but resume hormonal activity until several months after birth, when incompletely understood mechanisms in the brain begin to suppress the activity of the arcuate nucleus. This has been referred to as maturation of the prepubertal "gonadostat," which becomes sensitive to negative feedback by [[sex steroid]]s. The period of hormonal activity until several months after birth, followed by suppression of activity, may correspond to the period of infant sexuality, followed by a [[latency stage]], which [[Sigmund Freud]] described.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=6507468 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/infantsexuality/ |year=1984 |last1=Lehrer |first1=S |title=Modern correlates of Freudian psychology. Infant sexuality and the unconscious. |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=977–80 |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(84)90172-4}}</ref>

[[Gonadotropin]] and sex steroid levels fall to low levels (nearly undetectable by current [[medical test|clinical assays]]) for approximately another 8 to 10 years of childhood. Evidence is accumulating that the reproductive system is not totally inactive during the childhood years. Subtle increases in gonadotropin pulses occur, and ovarian follicles surrounding [[germ cell]]s (future [[Ovum|egg]]s) double in number.

Normal puberty is initiated in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an ongoing active suppression by other areas of the brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. [[Leptin]] levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.

Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] (GnRH) into the blood of the pituitary portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that, in turn, is the result of an [[oscillator]] or signal generator in the central nervous system ("GnRH pulse generator").<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1210/er.22.6.721 |title=In Memoriam: Ernst Knobil (1926-2000) |year=2001 |last1=Neill |first1=J.

An array of "autoamplification processes" increases the production of all of the pubertal hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Regulation of [[adrenarche]] and its relationship to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal [[androgen]]s (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens contribute to the development of pubic hair ([[pubarche]]), adult [[body odor]], and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.

===Hormonal changes in boys===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2011}}
Early stages of male hypothalamic maturation seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1–2 years later.

LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to make testosterone and blood levels begin to rise. For much of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime. Regularity of frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin pulses seems to be less necessary for progression of male than female puberty.

However, a significant portion of [[testosterone]] in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue ([[gynecomastia]]) in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild [[gynecomastia]] or even developing [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]s under [[nipple]]s during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of [[estradiol]].

Another hormonal change in males takes place during the teenage years for most young men. At this point in a male's life the testosterone levels slowly rise, and most of the effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion [[dihydrotestosterone]] in target organs (especially that of the bowels).

===Hormonal changes in girls===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2011}}
As the amplitude of LH pulses increases, the theca cells of the ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of [[progesterone]]. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called [[granulosa cell]]s. Smaller increases of FSH induce an increase in the [[aromatase]] activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by [[SHBG]] which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and [[prolactin]] levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).

Rising levels of estradiol produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty: growth spurt, acceleration of bone maturation and closure, [[breast]] [[Human development (biology)|growth]], increased fat composition, growth of the uterus, increased thickness of the [[endometrium]] and the vaginal mucosa, and widening of the lower pelvis.

As the estradiol levels gradually rise and the other autoamplification processes occur, a point of maturation is reached when the feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic "gonadostat" becomes positive. This attainment of positive feedback is the hallmark of female sexual maturity, as it allows the mid cycle LH surge necessary for [[ovulation]].

Growth hormone levels rise steadily throughout puberty. [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF1]] levels rise and then decline as puberty ends. Growth finishes and adult height is attained as the estradiol levels complete closure of the [[epiphyses]].
