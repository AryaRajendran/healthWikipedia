'''Robert James''' (1703 &ndash; 23 March 1776) was an [[English people|English]] [[physician]] who is best known as the author of ''A Medicinal Dictionary'', as the inventor of a popular "fever powder", and as a friend of [[Samuel Johnson]].

==Life==
James was born in 1703, at [[Kinvaston]] in [[Staffordshire]], to Edward James, a major in the English army, and his wife Frances, a sister of [[Sir Robert Clarke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Clarke]]. His early education was at [[King Edward VI School (Lichfield)|Lichfield Grammar School]], where he became acquainted with his fellow student Samuel Johnson. He then attended [[St John's College, Oxford]], from which he received the degree of [[A.B.]] on 5 July 1726. He was admitted as an extra-licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] on 12 January 1727/8, and in May of the same year was created doctor of medicine at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] by royal mandate. He practiced at [[Sheffield]], Lichfield, and [[Birmingham]] before moving to [[London]], where he was admitted as a licentiate of the Royal College on 25 June 1765. He died on 23 March 1776, aged seventy-three.<ref name =roll>{{cite book |title=The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London: Vol. II, 1701 to 1800 |last=Munk |first=William | authorlink = William Munk|year=1878 |publisher=Royal College of Physicians |location=London |page=269 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=LeMRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA269  |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

James's most notable publication was his three-volume ''Medicinal Dictionary'' (1743–1745), for which his friend Samuel Johnson wrote the "proposals", as well as several of the dictionary's articles (mainly at the beginning of the alphabet), including those for ''[[actuarius]]'' and [[Aretaeus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Samuel Johnson |last=Bate |first=W.

His fever powder, which he patented in 1747, was one of the most successful of 18th-century [[patent medicine]]s,<ref name=Wiltshire>{{cite book |title=Samuel Johnson in the Medical World: The Doctor and the Patient |last=Wiltshire |first=John |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge UP |location=Cambridge |page=96 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=waSr-jycAJEC&pg=PA96 |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>
though he is said to have "tarnished his image by patenting his powders, and falsifying their specification".<ref name=roll /> (It was considered unbecomingly mercenary to patent a medicine, and his falsification of the ingredients in the patent documentation would have been designed to prevent others from replicating his formulation.) The use of this preparation, a compound of [[antimony]] and [[phosphate of lime]], has been cited as a contributing factor in the death of [[Oliver Goldsmith]].<ref>{{cite book |title=England in the Restoration and Early Eighteenth Century: Essays on Culture and Society |last=O'Malley |first=C.
