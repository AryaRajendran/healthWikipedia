'''Postperfusion syndrome''', also known as "'''pumphead'''" is a constellation of [[neurocognitive]] impairments attributed to [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] (CPB) during [[cardiac surgery]].  Symptoms of postperfusion syndrome are subtle and include defects associated with attention, concentration, short term memory, fine motor function, and speed of mental and motor responses.<ref name="Jenson">{{cite journal | author = Jensen B, Hughes P, Rasmussen L, Pedersen P, Steinbrüchel D | title = Cognitive outcomes in elderly high-risk patients after off-pump versus conventional coronary artery bypass grafting: a randomized trial. | journal = Circulation | volume = 113 | issue = 24 | pages = 2790–5 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16769915 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.587931}}</ref>  Studies have shown a high incidence of neurocognitive deficit soon after surgery, but the deficits are often transient with no permanent neurological impairment.<ref name="Jenson"/><ref name="VanDijk">{{cite journal | author = Van Dijk D, Jansen E, Hijman R, Nierich A, Diephuis J, Moons K, Lahpor J, Borst C, Keizer A, Nathoe H, Grobbee D, De Jaegere P, Kalkman C | title = Cognitive outcome after off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomized trial. | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 11 | pages = 1405–12 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11903027 | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.11.1405}}</ref>

==Evidence ==
A study by Newman et al. at [[Duke University Medical Center]] published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (NEJM), showed an increased incidence of cognitive decline after [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (CABG); both immediately (53 percent at discharge from [[hospital]]) and over time (36 percent six weeks, 24 percent at six months, and 42 percent at five years).<ref name="Newman">{{cite journal | author = Newman M, Kirchner J, Phillips-Bute B, Gaver V, Grocott H, Jones R, Mark D, Reves J, Blumenthal J | title = Longitudinal assessment of neurocognitive function after coronary-artery bypass surgery. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 6 | pages = 395–402 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11172175 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200102083440601}}</ref>  This study shows an association of neurocognitive decline with CABG, but does not show [[Correlation does not imply causation|causation]]; the study lacks a [[control group]] and is considered [[Evidence-based medicine#Qualification of evidence|level II-3 evidence]]. Also, the statistical calculation of cognitive decline has been demonstrated as the least reliable due to practice effects, measurement error and the regression to the mean phenomena .<ref name="Raymond">{{cite journal | author = Raymond P, Hinton-Bayre A, Radel M, Ray M, Marsh N  | title = Assessment of statistical change criteria used to define significant change in neuropsychological test performance following cardiac surgery. | journal = Eur J Cardiothorac Surg | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–88 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16337395 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcts.2005.10.016}}</ref>

Subsequent studies have compared "on-pump" CABG to [[off-pump coronary artery bypass]] (OPCAB)—essentially establishing controls to compare the incidence of neurocognitive decline in CABG with and without the use of CPB.  A small study (60 patients total, 30 in each treatment arm) by Zamvar et al. demonstrated neurocognitive impairment at both 1 week and 10 weeks postoperatively.<ref name="Zamvar">{{cite journal | author = Zamvar V, Williams D, Hall J, Payne N, Cann C, Young K, Karthikeyan S, Dunne J | title = Assessment of neurocognitive impairment after off-pump and on-pump techniques for coronary artery bypass graft surgery: prospective randomised controlled trial. | journal = BMJ | volume = 325 | issue = 7375 | pages = 1268 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12458242 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.325.7375.1268 | pmc = 136922}}</ref>  A larger study (281 patients total) by Van Dijk et al. showed CABG surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass improved cognitive outcomes 3 months after the procedure, but the effects were limited and became negligible at 12 months.<ref name="VanDijk"/>  Furthermore, the Van Dijk study showed no difference between the on-pump and off-pump groups in quality of life, [[stroke]] rate, or all-cause [[death|mortality]] at 3 and 12 months.  A study by Jenson et al. published in Circulation found no significant difference in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after either OPCAB or conventional on-pump CABG.<ref name="Jenson"/>

Given the above evidence, there is high incidence of neurocognitive deficit post bypass surgery, but the deficits are transient with no permanent neurological impairment.  Controlled "on-pump" versus "off-pump" cardiac surgery has only been studied in the setting of CABG and is not necessarily generalizable to other types of cardiac surgery.  Recent advancements in [[transcatheter]] and [[percutaneous]] [[valve replacement]] may soon allow comparison of other types of cardiac surgery with and without CPB.

==Neurocognitive deficit as a consequence of vascular disease==
A study by McKhann et al.<ref name="McKhann">{{cite journal | author = McKhann G, Grega M, Borowicz L, Bailey M, Barry S, Zeger S, Baumgartner W, Selnes O | title = Is there cognitive decline 1 year after CABG? Comparison with surgical and nonsurgical controls. | journal = Neurology | volume = 65 | issue = 7 | pages = 991–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16107605 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000175220.78475.99}}</ref> compared the neurocognitive outcome of people with [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) to heart-healthy controls (people with no cardiac risk factors).  People with CAD were subdivided into treatment with CABG, OPCAB and non-surgical medical management. The three groups with CAD all performed significantly lower at baseline than the heart-healthy controls.  All groups improved by 3 months, and there were minimal intrasubject changes from 3 to 12 months.  No consistent difference between the CABG and off-pump patients was observed.  The authors concluded patients with long-standing coronary artery disease have some degree of cognitive dysfunction secondary to [[cerebrovascular]] disease before surgery; there is no evidence the cognitive test performance of bypass surgery patients differed from similar control groups with coronary artery disease over a 12 month follow-up period.  A related study by Selnes et al.<ref name="Selnes">{{cite journal | author = Selnes O, Grega M, Borowicz L, Barry S, Zeger S, Baumgartner W, McKhann G | title = Cognitive outcomes three years after coronary artery bypass surgery: a comparison of on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery and nonsurgical controls. | journal = Ann Thorac Surg | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 1201–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15797050 | doi = 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.10.011}}</ref> concluded patients with coronary artery bypass grafting did not differ from a comparable nonsurgical control group with coronary artery disease 1 or 3 years after baseline examination. This finding suggests that late cognitive decline after coronary artery bypass grafting previously reported by Newman et al.<ref name="Newman"/> may not be specific to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, but may also occur in patients with similar risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

==Proposed mechanism ==
Physicians have theorized that the syndrome is caused by tiny debris and air bubbles ([[microemboli]]) that enter the brain via cardiopulmonary bypass.  Surgeons attempt to minimize time spent on bypass to decrease postoperative deficits; studies have shown increased bypass time is associated with increased incidence and severity of postperfusion syndrome{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and mortality. It is unclear how increases in bypass time would result in such increases if pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions are the principal causative mechanisms of postperfusion syndrome.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==In the press==
Postperfusion syndrome has attracted some public notoriety following the coronary bypasses of former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]]. ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' speculated that Clinton experienced permanent debilitating brain damage; using the NEJM article<ref name="Newman">{{cite journal | author = Newman M, Kirchner J, Phillips-Bute B, Gaver V, Grocott H, Jones R, Mark D, Reves J, Blumenthal J | title = Longitudinal assessment of neurocognitive function after coronary-artery bypass surgery. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 6 | pages = 395–402 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200102083440601 |  pmid = 11172175}}</ref> discussed above to provide credibility to the claim.
