'''Volkmann's contracture''', also known as '''Volkmann's ischaemic contracture''', is a permanent [[flexion]] [[contracture]] of the [[hand]] at the [[wrist]], resulting in a claw-like deformity of the hand and fingers. It is more common in children. Passive extension of fingers is restricted and painful.<ref name="France2003">{{cite book|author=Robert C. France|title=Introduction to sports medicine & athletic training|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YyOCem-151sC&pg=PA426|accessdate=15 April 2010|date=30 December 2003|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4018-1199-0|pages=426–}}</ref> On examination the fingers are white or blue and cold and the [[radial pulse]] is absent.

==History==
It is named after Dr. [[Richard von Volkmann]] (1830 - 1889), the 19th century German doctor who first described it,<ref>R. Volkmann. Die ischämischen Muskellähmungen und Kontracturen. Centralblatt für Chirurgie, Leipzig, 1881, 8: 801-803.</ref> in a paper on ''"non-Infective Ischemic conditions of various fascial compartments in the extremities"''.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2865}}</ref> Because the contracture occurred at the same time as the paralysis, he considered a nerve etiology to be unlikely.<ref name="Association1913">{{cite book|author=American Surgical Association|title=Annals of surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=avcAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA555|accessdate=15 April 2010|year=1913|publisher=J. B. Lippincott|pages=555–}}</ref>

==Causes==
Any fracture in elbow region or upper arm may lead to Volkmann's ischemic contracture but commonly caused due to [[supracondylar fracture]] of the [[humerus]].

Volkmann's contracture results from acute [[ischaemia]]/[[necrosis]] of the muscle fibres of the flexor group of [[Forearm#Muscles|muscles of the forearm]], especially [[flexor digitorum profundus]] and [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]] which becomes fibrotic and short. 

It is caused by obstruction on the [[brachial artery]] near the elbow, possibly from improper use of a [[tourniquet]], improper use of a [[Orthopedic cast|plaster cast]], or [[compartment syndrome]].
It is also caused by fracture of forearm bones which cause profuse bleeding from major blood vessels of forearm.

==Treatment==
Surgery to release the fixed tissues may help with the deformity and function of the hand.

All splints, plaster and bandages that might be obstructing the circulation should be removed and fascial compartment should be opened [[fasciotomy]] in incipient stage.

Prevention:
* requires restoration of blood flow;
* reduction of compartmental pressure

Management:
* proper initial splinting of hand in the function position;
* release of forearm flexors;
** muscle slide
** tendon lengthening;
* test for intrinsic tightness
* free functional muscle transfer
