'''Blastocystosis''' refers to a medical condition caused by infection with ''[[Blastocystis]]''.  ''Blastocystis'' is a protozoal, single-celled parasite that inhabits the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals.  Many different types of ''Blastocystis'' exist, and they can infect humans, farm animals, birds, rodents, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and even cockroaches.

== Classification ==

Physicians have produced conflicting reports regarding whether ''Blastocystis'' causes disease in humans.  These reports resulted in a brief debate in medical journals in the early 1990s between some physicians in the United States who believed that ''Blastocystis'' was harmless, and physicians in the United States and overseas who believed it could cause disease.

At the time, it was common practice to identify all ''Blastocystis'' from humans as ''[[Blastocystis hominis]]'', while ''Blastocystis'' from animals was identified differently (i.e. ''Blastocystis ratti'' from rats).  Research performed since then has shown that the concept of ''Blastocystis hominis'' as a unique species of ''Blastocystis'' infecting humans is not supported by microbiological findings.  Although one species group associated with primates was found, it was also discovered that humans can acquire infection from any one of nine species groups of ''Blastocystis'' which are also carried by cattle, pigs, rodents, chickens, pheasants, monkeys, dogs and other animals.<ref name="PARKAR_2006" /><ref name="STENSVOLD_2007" /><ref name="NOEL_2005" /> Research has suggested that some types produce few or no symptoms, while others producing illness and intestinal inflammation.<ref name="TAN_2006A" /><ref name="TAN_2006B" />  Researchers have suggested conflicting reports may be due to the practice of naming all ''Blastocystis'' from humans ''Blastocystis hominis''<ref name="STENSVOLD_2007" /> and have proposed discontinuing the use of that term.<ref name="STENSVOLD_2007" />  

A standard naming system for ''Blastocystis'' organisms from humans and animals has been proposed which names ''Blastocystis'' isolates according to the genetic identity of the ''Blastocystis'' organism rather than the host.<ref name="STENSVOLD_2007" />  The naming system used identifies all isolates as ''Blastocystis sp. subtype nn'' where nn is a number from 1 to 9 indicating the species group of the ''Blastocystis'' organism.  The identification of the species can not be performed with a microscope at this time, because the different species look alike.  Identification requires equipment for genetic analysis that is common in microbiology laboratories, but not available to most physicians.  Some new scientific papers have begun using the standard naming system.<ref name="MEN_2007">{{cite journal |author=Menounos PG, Spanakos G, Tegos N, Vassalos CM, Papadopoulou C, Vakalis NC |title=Direct detection of Blastocystis sp. in human faecal samples and subtype assignment using single strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing |journal= Molecular and Cellular Probes|volume= 22|issue= 1|pages= 24–9|year=2007 |pmid=17669623 |doi=10.1016/j.mcp.2007.06.007}}</ref>

=== Variation in severity ===

Researchers have sought to develop models to understand the variety of symptoms seen in humans.  Some patients do not have symptoms, while others report severe diarrhea and fatigue.

A number of researchers have investigated the possibility that some species of Blastocystis are more virulent than others.    An Italian researcher reported differences in the protein profiles of isolates associated with chronic and acute infection.<ref name="LANUZA_1999">{{cite journal |author=Lanuza MD, Carbajal JA, Villar J, Mir A, Borras R. |title=Soluble-protein and antigenic heterogeneity in axenic ''Blastocystis hominis'' isolates: pathogenic implications|journal=Parasitol Res.|volume=85|issue=2 |pages=93–7 |year=1999 |pmid=9934956 |doi=10.1007/s004360050515}}</ref>  A research team from Malaysia reported that isolates from symptomatic patients produced large amoeboid forms that were not present in isolates from asymptomatic patients.<ref name="TAN_2006B" />  The development of a classification system for Blastocystis in 2007 produced a series of studies investigating this possibility.

==Diagnosis==
===Clinically available===

Diagnosis is performed by determining if the infection is present, and then making a decision as to whether the infection is responsible for the symptoms.  Diagnostic methods in clinical use have been reported to be of poor quality and more reliable methods have been reported in research papers.<ref name="PARKAR_2006">{{cite journal |author=Parkar U, Traub RJ, Kumar S, ''et al.'' |title=Direct characterization of Blastocystis from faeces by PCR and evidence of zoonotic potential |journal=Parasitology |volume=134 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=359–67 |year=2007 |pmid=17052374 |doi=10.1017/S0031182006001582}}</ref><ref name="MAHMOUD_2003">{{cite journal |author=Mahmoud MS, Saleh WA |title=Secretory and humoral antibody responses to ''Blastocystis hominis'' in symptomatic and asymptomatic human infections |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=13–30 |year=2003 |pmid=12739797 }}</ref><ref name="LEELA_2002">{{cite journal |author=Leelayoova S, Taamasri P, Rangsin R, Naaglor T, Thathaisong U, Mungthin M |title=In-vitro cultivation: a sensitive method for detecting ''Blastocystis hominis'' |journal=Ann.

[[File:BLASTOCYSTIS SENSITIVITY CHART.png|thumb|200px|right|Percentage of Blastocystis Infections Detected by Direct Microscopy in Various Studies]] 

For identification of infection, the only method clinically available in most areas is the ''Ova and Parasite'' (O&P) exam, which identifies the presence of the organism by microscopic examination of a chemically preserved stool specimen.  This method is sometimes called "Direct Microscopy".  In the United States, pathologists are required to report the presence of ''Blastocystis'' when found during an O&P exam, so a special test does not have to be ordered. Direct Microscopy is inexpensive, as the same test can identify a variety of gastrointestinal infections, such as [[Giardia]], [[Entamoeba histolytica]], [[Cryptosporidium]].  However one laboratory director noted that pathologists using conventional microscopes failed to identify many ''Blastocystis'' infections, and indicated the necessity for special microscopic equipment for identification.<ref name="LEE_1991" />  The following table shows the sensitivity of Direct Microscopy in detecting ''Blastocystis'' when compared to stool culture, a more sensitive technique.  Stool culture was considered by some researchers to be the most reliable technique, but a recent study found stool culture only detected 83% of individuals infected when compared to [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) testing.<ref name="STENSVOLD_2006" />

Reasons given for the failure of Direct Microscopy include: (1) Variable Shedding: The quantity of ''Blastocystis'' organisms varies substantially from day to day in infected humans and animals;<ref name="VENILLA_1999">{{cite journal |author=Vennila GD, Suresh Kumar G, Khairul Anuar A, ''et al.'' |title=Irregular shedding of ''Blastocystis hominis'' |journal=Parasitol. Res. |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=162–4 |year=1999 |pmid=9934969 |doi=10.1007/s004360050528}}</ref>  (2) Appearance: Some forms of ''Blastocystis'' resemble fat cells or white blood cells,<ref name="STENSVOLD_2006" /> making it difficult to distinguish the organism from other cells in the stool sample; (3) Large number of morphological forms: ''Blastocystis'' cells can assume a variety of shapes, some have been described in detail only recently, so it is possible that additional forms exist but have not been identified.<ref name="STENSVOLD_2006" />

Several methods have been cited in literature for determination of the significance of the finding of ''Blastocystis'':

#'''Diagnosis only when large numbers of organism present:''' Some physicians consider ''Blastocystis'' infection to be a cause of illness only when large numbers are found in stool samples.<ref name="EL_SHAZLY_2005">{{cite journal |author=El-Shazly AM, Abdel-Magied AA, El-Beshbishi SN, El-Nahas HA, Fouad MA, Monib MS |title=''Blastocystis hominis'' among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in Talkha Center, Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=653–66 |year=2005 |pmid=16083074 }}</ref>  Researchers have questioned this approach, noting that it is not used with any other protozoal infections, such as [[Giardia]] or [[Entamoeba histolytica]].   Some researchers have reported no correlation between number of organisms present in stool samples and the level of symptoms.<ref name="DOYLE_1990">{{cite journal |author=Doyle PW, Helgason MM, Mathias RG, Proctor EM |title=Epidemiology and pathogenicity of Blastocystis hominis |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=116–21 |year=1990 |pmid=2298869 |pmc=269548}}</ref>  A study using [[polymerase chain reaction]] testing of stool samples suggested that symptomatic infection can exist even when sufficient quantities of the organism do not exist for identification through Direct Microscopy.<ref name="STENSVOLD_2006" />
#'''Diagnosis-by-exclusion''': Some physicians diagnose ''Blastocystis'' infection by excluding all other causes, such as infection with other organisms, food intolerances, colon cancer, etc.  This method can be time consuming and expensive, requiring many tests such as [[endoscopy]] and [[colonoscopy]].
#'''Disregarding ''Blastocystis'' ''': In the early to mid 1990s, some US physicians suggested all findings of ''Blastocystis'' are insignificant.  No recent publications expressing this opinion could be found.<ref name="MARKELL_1990" /><ref name="MARKELL_1995">{{cite journal |author=Markell EK |title=Is there any reason to continue treating Blastocystis infections? |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=104–5 |year=1995 |pmid=7578717 |doi=10.1093/clinids/21.1.104}}</ref>

===Not clinically available===

The following diagnostic methods are not routinely available to patients.  Researchers have reported that they are more reliable at detecting infection, and in some cases can provide the physician with information to help determine whether ''Blastocystis'' infection is the cause of the patient's symptoms:

'''Serum antibody testing''': A 1993 research study performed by the [[NIH]] with United States patients suggested that it was possible to distinguish symptomatic and asymptomatic infection with ''Blastocystis'' using serum antibody testing.<ref name="ZIERDT_1993">{{cite journal |author=Zierdt CH, Nagy B |title=Antibody response to ''Blastocystis hominis'' infections |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=118 |issue=12 |pages=985–6 |year=1993 |pmid=8489119 }}</ref>  The study used blood samples to measure the patient's immune reaction to chemicals present on the surface of the ''Blastocystis'' cell.  It found that patients diagnosed with symptomatic ''Blastocystis'' infection exhibited a much higher immune response than controls who had ''Blastocystis'' infection but no symptoms.  The study was repeated in 2003 at [[Ain Shams University]] in Egypt with Egyptian patients with equivalent results.<ref name="MAHMOUD_2003" />  

'''Fecal Antibody Testing''': A 2003 study at Ain Shams University in Egypt indicated that patients symptomatically infected could be distinguished with a fecal antibody test.<ref name="MAHMOUD_2003" /> The study compared patients diagnosed with symptomatic ''Blastocystis'' infection to controls who had ''Blastocystis'' infection but no symptoms.  In the group with symptoms, IgA antibodies to ''Blastocystis'' were detected in fecal specimens that were not present in the healthy control group. 

'''Stool Culture''':  Culturing has been shown to be a more reliable method of identifying infection.  In 2006, researchers reported the ability to distinguish between disease causing and non-disease causing isolates of ''Blastocystis'' using stool culture.<ref name="TAN_2006A">{{cite journal |author=Tan TC, Suresh KG, Thong KL, Smith HV |title=PCR fingerprinting of Blastocystis isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic human hosts |journal=Parasitol. Res. |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=459–65 |year=2006 |pmid=16628457 |doi=10.1007/s00436-006-0177-0}}</ref>  ''Blastocystis'' cultured from patients who were sick and diagnosed with ''Blastocystis'' infection produced large, highly adhesive amoeboid forms in culture.  These cells were absent in ''Blastocystis'' cultures from healthy controls.  Subsequent genetic analysis showed the ''Blastocystis'' from healthy controls was genetically distinct from that found in patients with symptoms.  Protozoal culture is unavailable in most countries due to the cost and lack of trained staff able to perform protozoal culture.  

'''Genetic Analysis of isolates''': Researchers have used techniques which allow the DNA of ''Blastocystis'' to be isolated from fecal specimens.<ref name="PARKAR_2006" /><ref name="STENSVOLD_2006" /> This method has been reported to be more reliable at detecting ''Blastocystis'' in symptomatic patients than stool culture.<ref name="STENSVOLD_2006" />  This method also allows the species group of ''Blastocystis'' to be identified.  Research is continuing into which species groups are associated with symptomatic (see Genetics and Symptoms) blastocystosis. 

'''Immuno-Fluorescence (IFA) Stain''': An IFA stain causes ''Blastocystis'' cells to glow when viewed under a microscope, making the diagnostic method more reliable.  IFA stains are in use for [[Giardia]] and [[Cryptosporidium]] for both diagnostic purposes and water quality testing.  A 1991 paper from the [[NIH]] described the laboratory development of one such stain.<ref name="ZIERDT_1991" />   However, no company currently offers this stain commercially.

Research studies have suggested the following items are '''not''' risk factors for contracting ''Blastocystis'' infection:

* '''Consumption of municipal water near water plant (not a risk factor)''': One study showed that municipal water was free of ''Blastocystis'', even when drawn from a polluted source.  However, samples taken far away from the treatment plant showed cysts.  The researchers suggested that aging pipes may permit intrusion of contaminated water into the distribution system.<ref name="BASUALDO_2000">{{cite journal |author=Basualdo J, Pezzani B, De Luca M, Córdoba A, Apezteguía M |title=Screening of the municipal water system of La Plata, Argentina, for human intestinal parasites |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=177–82 |year=2000 |pmid=11109572 |doi=10.1078/S1438-4639(04)70025-5}}</ref>

==Pathogeneses==

Pathogenesis refers to the mechanism by which an organism causes disease.  The following disease-causing mechanisms have been reported in studies of ''Blastocystis'' infection:

* '''Barrier Disruption''': In isolates from ''Blastocystis sp. subtype 4'', study has demonstrated that ''Blastocystis'' has the ability to alter the arrangement of F-actin in intestinal [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]]. [[Actin|Actin filaments]] are important in stabilizing [[tight junctions]]; they in turn stabilize the barrier, which is a layer of cells, between the intestinal epithelial cells and the intestinal content.<ref name="PUTHIA_2006">{{cite journal |author=Puthia MK, Sio SW, Lu J, Tan KS |title=Blastocystis ratti Induces Contact-Independent Apoptosis, F-Actin Rearrangement, and Barrier Function Disruption in IEC-6 Cells |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=4114–23 |year=2006 |pmid=16790785 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00328-06 |pmc=1489721}}</ref> The parasite causes the actin filaments to rearrange, and so compromising barrier function. This has been suggested to contribute to the diarrheal symptoms sometimes observed in ''Blastocystis'' patients.

* '''Invasiveness''': Invasive infection has been reported in humans<ref name="LEE_1990" /><ref name="TAWIL_1994">{{cite journal |author=al-Tawil YS, Gilger MA, Gopalakrishna GS, Langston C, Bommer KE |title=Invasive ''Blastocystis hominis'' infection in a child |journal=Archives of pediatrics &amp; adolescent medicine |volume=148 |issue=8 |pages=882–5 |year=1994 |pmid=8044274 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1994.02170080112026 }}</ref> and animal studies.<ref name="ZHANG_2006" />

* '''Immune Modulation''': ''Blastocystis'' has been shown to provoke cells from the human colon to produce inflammatory [[cytokines]] [[Interleukin-8]] and [[GM-CSF]].<ref name="LONG_2001">{{cite journal |author=Long HY, Handschack A, König W, Ambrosch A |title=''Blastocystis hominis'' modulates immune responses and cytokine release in colonic epithelial cells |journal=Parasitol. Res. |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=1029–30 |year=2001 |pmid=11763434 }}</ref>  [[Interleukin-8]] plays a role in rheumatoid arthritis.

* '''Protease Secretion''': ''Blastocystis'' secretes a [[protease]] that breaks up antibodies produced and secreted into the [[gastrointestinal tract]] lumen.<ref name="PUTHIA_2005 ">{{cite journal |author=Puthia MK, Vaithilingam A, Lu J, Tan KS |title=Degradation of human secretory immunoglobulin A by Blastocystis |journal=Parasitol.

By breaking up the antibodies, it allows the persistence of ''Blastocystis'' in the human gut. Another more recent study has also shown and proposed that, in response to the proteases secreted by ''Blastocystis'', the intestinal [[Host (biology)|host cells]] would signal a series of events to be carried out, eventually leading to the self-destruction of the host cells – a phenomenon known as [[apoptosis]]<ref name="PUTHIA_2006" />

* '''Other secretory mechanism''': A study of a different protozoan which produces similar symptoms, ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', found that organism secretes several neurologically active chemicals, such as [[serotonin]] and [[Substance P]].<ref name="MCGOWAN_1983">{{cite journal |author=McGowan K, Kane A, Asarkof N, ''et al.'' |title=''Entamoeba histolytica'' causes intestinal secretion: role of serotonin |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4612 |pages=762–4 |year=1983 |pmid=6308760 |doi=10.1126/science.6308760}}</ref><ref name="MCGOWAN_1985">{{cite journal |author=McGowan K, Guerina V, Wicks J, Donowitz M |title=Secretory hormones of ''Entamoeba histolytica'' |journal=Ciba Found.

Developing countries have been reported to have higher incidences, however recent studies suggest that symptomatic infection with ''Blastocystis'' may be prevalent in certain areas of industrialized countries as well:

* A nation-wide study conducted by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] using data reported from 1987 found the prevalence ''Blastocystis'' infection in the United States to be 2.6%.<ref name="KAPPUS_1991" /> The study indicated that Western states, such as California, reported a higher prevalence.

==Research==

While many enteric protists are the subject of research, ''Blastocystis'' is unusual in that basic questions concerning how it should be diagnosed and treated and how it causes disease remain unsettled.  The following groups have ongoing research programs directed at these questions:
