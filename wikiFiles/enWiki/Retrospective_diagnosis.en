A '''retrospective diagnosis''' (also '''retrodiagnosis''' or '''posthumous diagnosis''') is the practice of identifying an illness in a historical figure using modern knowledge, methods and [[nosology|disease classifications]].<ref name=MedTerms>{{cite web

Retrospective diagnosis is practised by medical historians, general historians and the media with varying degrees of scholarship. At its worst it may become "little more than a game, with ill-defined rules and little academic credibility."<ref name=Elmer2004/> The process often requires "translating between linguistic and conceptual worlds separated by several centuries",<ref name=Siena2005>{{cite book

The term ''retrospective diagnosis'' is also sometimes used by a [[clinical pathology|clinical pathologist]] to describe a [[medical diagnosis]] in a person made some time after the original illness has resolved or after death. In such cases, analysis of a [[Laboratory specimen|physical specimen]] may yield a confident medical diagnosis. The search for the [[AIDS origin|origin of AIDS]] has involved posthumous diagnosis of [[AIDS]] in people who died decades before the disease was first identified.<ref name=HooperBMJ>{{cite journal
