An '''antiflatulent''' agent is a drug used for the alleviation or prevention of excessive intestinal gas, i.e., [[flatulence]].  

==Mechanisms of action==
=== Preventing gas === 
* '''Enzymes''' – [[Enzyme]]-based [[dietary supplement]]s break down indigestible substances and prevent these substances from reaching the [[large intestine]] intact – where anaerobic [[bacteria]] produce gas. Substances indigestible by humans are usually present in foods associated with flatulence, like [[bean]]s.  When these substances reach the large intestine intact, they may be fermented by intestinal bacteria, thereby causing gas production.  These supplements are usually taken with foods associated with flatulence. It is important to take the appropriate enzyme with the appropriate food. When consuming beans and other vegetables high in [[complex carbohydrate]]s, it may be helpful to take a product that contains [[alpha-galactosidase]], such as [[Beano (dietary supplement)|Beano]]. Additionally, for individuals with [[lactose intolerance]], taking a [[lactase]]-containing product with [[lactose]]-containing foodstuffs may reduce flatulence.

* '''Herbal inhibitors''' – Many herbal substances have been observed since antiquity for reducing flatulence, particularly gas from eating [[legume]]s. [[Cloves]], [[cinnamon]], and [[garlic]] are potent in reducing gas. The potency of garlic increases when heated, whereas the potency of cinnamon decreases. Other spices have a smaller effect in reducing gas, including [[turmeric]], [[black pepper]], [[asafoetida]] and [[ginger]]. Other common Indian spices, [[cumin]], [[aniseed]], [[ajowan]], and [[cardamom]] do ''not'' inhibit gas production. <ref name="Savitri">A. Savitri, T. N. Bhavanishankar and H. S. R. Desikachar.

=== Relieving gas === 
For the ''alleviation'' of flatulence, an antifoaming agent such as [[simeticone]] may be taken orally. This agent will coalesce the smaller gas bubbles into larger bubbles, thereby easing the release of gas within the [[gastrointestinal tract]] via [[burping]] or flatulence.

===Herbal antiflatulents===
*[[Epazote]] is claimed to have antiflatulent properties.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Passion for pulses: health benefits of pulses and why Australians should eat more of them |author=NE Longnecker |journal=Proceedings of the nutrition society of Australia |year=2000 |volume=24 |pages=191–195 |url=http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/apjcn/ProcNutSoc/2000+/2000/Long191.pdf |format=pdf |quote=Some herbs are also thought to counteract the flatulence effect, including cumin seed, epazote, asafoetida and winter savoury.}}</ref>
