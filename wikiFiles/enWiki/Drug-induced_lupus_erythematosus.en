'''Drug-induced lupus erythematosus''' (DIL or DILE) is an [[autoimmune]] disorder (similar to [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] [SLE]) caused by chronic use of certain drugs. These drugs cause an autoimmune response (the body attacks its own cells) producing symptoms similar to those of SLE. There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases:  [[hydralazine]], [[procainamide]], and [[isoniazid]].<ref name=Rubin>{{cite web

== Causes ==

The processes that lead to drug-induced lupus erythematosus are not entirely understood. The exact processes that occur are not known even after 50 years since its discovery, but many studies present theories on the mechanisms of DIL.
 
A predisposing factor to developing DIL is N-acetylation speed, or the rate at which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme [[N-Acetyltransferase|N-acetyltransferase]]. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine [[metabolites]] in their urine than fast acetylators.<ref name=Lahita>{{cite book

Of the drugs that cause DIL, [[hydralazine]] has been found to cause a higher incidence. Hydralazine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. Approximately 5% of the patients who have taken hydralazine over long periods of time and in high doses have shown DIL-like symptoms.<ref name=Schur223>Schur, Peter H. ''et al.'' (1983), p. 223.</ref>  Many of the other drugs have a low to very low risk to develop DIL. The following table shows the risk of development of DIL of some of these drugs on a very to high scale.<ref name=Rubin/>

* High risk:
** [[Procainamide]] ([[antiarrhythmic]])
** [[Hydralazine]] ([[antihypertensive]])

* Moderate to low risk:
** [[Infliximab]] anti ([[TNF-alpha]])
** [[Etanercept]] anti ([[TNF-alpha]])
** [[Isoniazid]] ([[antibiotic]])
** [[Minocycline]] ([[antibiotic]])
** [[Pyrazinamide]]  ([[antibiotic]])
** [[Quinidine]] ([[antiarrhythmic]])
** [[D-Penicillamine]] ([[anti-inflammatory]])
** [[Carbamazepine]] ([[anticonvulsant]])
** [[Oxcarbazepine]] ([[anticonvulsant]])
** [[Phenytoin]] ([[anticonvulsant]])
** [[Propafenone]] ([[antiarrhythmic]])

== Symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus include:
* Joint pain ([[Arthralgia]]) and muscle pain ([[myalgia]])
* Fatigue
* Inflammation of the heart ([[pericarditis]]) and lungs ([[pleuritis]])
* [[Anti-histone antibodies]] in 95% of cases

These signs and symptoms are not side effects of the drugs taken which occur during short term use. DIL occurs over long-term and chronic use of the medications listed above. While these symptoms are similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus, they are generally not as severe unless they are ignored which leads to more harsh symptoms, and in some reported cases, death.

== Treatment ==
It is important to recognize early that these drugs are causing DIL like symptoms and discontinue use of the drug. Symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) will quicken the healing process. [[Corticosteroid]]s may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present.
