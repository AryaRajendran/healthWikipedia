'''Bursitis''' is the [[inflammation]] of one or more [[bursa (anatomy)|bursae]] (small sacs) of [[synovial fluid]] in the body. The bursae rest at the points where internal functionaries, such as [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s, slide across [[bone]]. Healthy bursae create a smooth, almost frictionless functional gliding surface making normal movement painless. When bursitis occurs, however, movement relying upon the inflamed bursa becomes difficult and painful. Moreover, movement of tendons and muscles over the inflamed bursa aggravates its inflammation, perpetuating the problem. Muscle can also be stiffened.

==Cause==
Bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive movement and excessive [[pressure]]. Shoulders, [[Elbow-joint|elbows]] and [[knee]]s are the most commonly affected. Inflammation of the bursae might also be caused by other inflammatory conditions such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[gout]]. Although infrequent, [[scoliosis]] might cause bursitis of the shoulders; however, shoulder bursitis is more commonly caused by overuse of the shoulder joint and related muscles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treatment-for.com/shoulder-bursitis-treatment.htm|title=Shoulder Bursitis}}</ref>

Traumatic [[injury]] is another cause of bursitis. The inflammation irritates because the bursa no longer fits in the original small area between the bone and the functionary muscle or tendon. When the bone increases pressure upon the bursa, bursitis results. Sometimes the reason is unknown. It can also be associated with some chronic systemic diseases.

==Examples by site==
The most common examples of this condition:
* [[Prepatellar bursitis]], "housemaid's knee"
* [[Infrapatellar bursitis]], "clergyman's knee"
* [[Greater trochanteric pain syndrome|Trochanteric bursitis]], giving pain over [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] aspect of hip
* [[Olecranon bursitis]], "student's elbow", characterised by pain and swelling in the elbow
* [[Subacromial bursitis]], giving shoulder pain, is the most common form of bursitis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fauci|first=Anthony|title=Harrison's Rheumatology, Second Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing; Digital Edition|isbn=9780071741460|pages=271}}</ref>
* [[Achilles bursitis]]
* [[Retrocalcaneal bursitis]]
* [[Ischial bursitis]], "weaver's bottom"
* [[Iliopsoas bursitis]]
* [[Pes anserine bursitis|Anserine bursitis]]

==Signs and symptoms==
Bursitis symptoms vary from local joint [[pain]] and stiffness, to stinging pain that surrounds the joint around the inflamed bursa. In this condition, the pain usually is worse during and after activity, and then the bursa and the surrounding joint become stiff the next morning.

==Treatment==
Bursae that are not infected can be treated with rest, [[ice]], elevation, [[physiotherapy]], [[anti-inflammatory drug]]s and pain medication. Since bursitis is caused by increased friction from the adjacent structures, a compression [[bandage]] is contraindicated because compression would create more friction on movement (passive and active). Advanced [[massage]] therapy techniques can also be employed to help with the inflammatory process of bursitis.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Bursae that are [[infection|infected]] require further investigation and [[antibiotic]] therapy. In cases when all conservative treatment fails, surgical therapy may be necessary. In a [[bursectomy]] the bursa is cut out either [[endoscopically]] or with open [[surgery]]. The bursa grows back in place after a couple of weeks but without any inflammatory component.
