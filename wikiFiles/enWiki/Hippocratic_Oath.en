The '''Hippocratic Oath''' is an oath historically taken by [[physician]]s and other healthcare professionals swearing to practice medicine honestly. It is widely believed to have been written either by [[Hippocrates]], often regarded as the father of western medicine, or by one of his students.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farnell|first=Lewis R.|title=Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immortality|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|date=2004-06-30|pages=234–279|chapter=Chapter 10|isbn=978-1-4179-2134-8}} p.269: "The famous Hippocratean oath may not be an authentic deliverance of the great master, but is an ancient formula current in his school."</ref> The oath is written in [[Ionic Greek]] (late 5th century BC),<ref>The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation By Ludwig Edelstein Page 56 ISBN 978-0-8018-0184-6 (1943)</ref>  and is usually included in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]].

The Hippocratic Oath ''(orkos)'' is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear upon a number of healing gods that he will uphold a number of professional ethical standards.

==Oath text==
===English Translation, version 1===
[[Apollo]] Physician and [[Asclepius]] and [[Hygieia]] and [[Panacea]] and all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfill according to my ability and judgment this oath and this covenant:

To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage and to teach them this art - if they desire to learn it - without fee and covenant; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and have taken an oath according to the medical law, but to no one else.

I will apply [[dietetic]] measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.

I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.

I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as are engaged in this work.

Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves.

What I may see or hear in the course of the treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself holding such things shameful to be spoken about.

If I fulfill this path and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honored with fame among all men for all time to come; if I transgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.<ref>The Hippocratic Oath: Text.

1943).</ref>

===English translation, version 2===

I swear by [[Apollo]], the healer, [[Asclepius]], [[Hygieia]], and [[Panacea]], and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following Oath and agreement:

To consider dear to me, as my parents, him who taught me [[medicine|this art]]; to live in common with him and, if necessary, to share my goods with him; To look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art;
and that by my teaching, I will impart a knowledge of this art to my own sons, and to my teacher's sons, and to disciples bound by an indenture and oath according to the medical laws, and no others.

I will [[Medical prescription#History|prescribe]] regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and [[primum non nocere|never do harm]] to anyone.

I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and similarly I will not give a woman a [[pessary]] to cause an [[abortion]].

But I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts.

I will not [[Lithotomy|cut for stone]], even for patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in [[Surgery|this art]].

In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or men, be they free or slaves.

All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will [[Physician-patient privilege|keep secret]] and will never reveal.

If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all humanity and in all times; but if I [[Perjury|swerve]] from it or violate it, may the reverse be my life.

The Oath has been modified multiple times, in several different countries. One of the most significant revisions is the [[Declaration of Geneva]], first drafted in 1948 by the World Medical Association; it has since been revised several times. While there is currently no legal obligation for medical students to swear an oath upon graduating, 98% of American medical students swear some form of oath, while only 50% of British medical students do. 

However, the vast majority of oaths or declarations sworn have been heavily modified and modernized. In a 1989 survey of 126 US medical schools, only three reported usage of the original oath, while thirty-three used the Declaration of Geneva, sixty-seven used a modified Hippocratic oath, four used the [[Oath of Maimonides]], one used a covenant, eight used another oath, one used an unknown oath, and two did not use any kind of oath. Seven medical schools did not reply to the survey. In France, it is common for new medical graduates to sign a written oath.<ref name="Medical oaths and declarations">{{cite journal|last=Sritharan|first=Kaji|coauthors=Georgina Russell, Zoe Fritz, Davina Wong, Matthew Rollin, Jake Dunning, Bruce Wayne, Philip Morgan, Catherine Sheehan|title=Medical oaths and declarations|journal=BMJ|year=2000|month=December|pmid=11751345|accessdate=19 August 2012|pmc=1121898|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1440–1}}</ref><ref name="Letters, BMJ 8/8/1994">{{cite journal|title=Letters|journal=BMJ|year=1994|month=October|volume=309|pages=952|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2541124/pdf/bmj00460-0068a.pdf|accessdate=19 August 2012|pmc=2541124|pmid=7950672|issue=6959|author=Crawshaw R}}</ref> 

The majority of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medical schools]] use the [[Osteopathic Oath]] in the United States. The oath was first used in 1938, and the current version has been in use since 1954.

It has been suggested {{By whom?|date=March 2013}} that a similar oath should be undertaken by scientists, a [[Hippocratic Oath for Scientists]].
