Sir '''John Struthers''' [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|FRCSE]] ({{Birth date|df=yes|1823|02|21}}, Brucefield, near [[Dunfermline]], [[Fife]]&nbsp;–  {{Death date|df=yes|1899|02|24}}, Edinburgh) was the first [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. He was a dynamic teacher and administrator, transforming the status of the institutions in which he worked. He was equally passionate about anatomy, enthusiastically seeking out and dissecting the largest and finest specimens, including whales, and troubling his colleagues with his single-minded quest for money and space for his collection.

Among scientists, he is perhaps best known for his work on the [[ligament]] which bears his name. His work on the rare and [[vestigial]] [[Ligament of Struthers]] came to the attention of [[Charles Darwin]], who used it in his ''[[Descent of Man]]'' to help argue the case that man and other [[mammals]] shared a [[common ancestor]].

Among the public, Struthers was famous for his [[dissection]] of the "[[Tay Whale]]", a [[humpback whale]] that appeared in the [[Firth of Tay]], was hunted and then dragged ashore to be exhibited across Britain. Struthers took every opportunity he could to dissect it and recover its bones.

In the medical profession, he was known for the papers and books that he wrote, as well as for his efficient work in his medical school, for which he was successively awarded medicine's highest honours, including membership of the [[General Medical Council]], fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], the presidency of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]], and finally a knighthood.

==Early life==

John Struthers was the son of Alexander Struthers (1767-1853) and his wife Mary Reid (1793-1859), of Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline.<ref name=Brucefield>{{cite web | url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-26046-off-old-mill-court-brucefield-house- | title=Off Old Mill Court, Brucefield House, Dunfermline | publisher=British Listed Buildings | accessdate=2 October 2012 | author=(Historic Scotland)}}</ref> Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and [[linen]] merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] mill built in 1792. Linen was threshed at the nearby [[threshing]] mill, and [[bleaching|bleached]] in the open air near the house. There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had gone by 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family.<ref name=Brucefield/> Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at [[Dunfermline Abbey]].<ref name=Dunfermline>{{Cite document | url = http://www.dunfermlineheritage.org.uk/webs/13/documents/Livinginthepast.pdf | title = Living in the past | chapter = Sir John Struthers 1823–1899 | publisher = Dunfermline Heritage Community Projects }}</ref>{{rp|76}}

Struthers was one of six children, three boys and three girls. The boys were privately tutored in the classics, mathematics and modern languages at home in Brucefield House. They went out boating in summer, skating in winter on the nearby dam; they rode ponies, went swimming in the nearby [[Firth of Forth]], and went for long walks with wealthy friends.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|76}} Both his older brother James and his younger brother Alexander studied medicine. James became a doctor at [[Leith]]; Alexander died of [[cholera]] while serving as a doctor in the [[Crimean War]]. His sisters Janet and Christina provided a simple education at Brucefield for some poor friends, Daniel and James Thomson. Daniel (1833-1908) became a Dunfermline weaver as well as a historian and reformer.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|71}}

==Medical career==

Struthers studied medicine at Edinburgh, winning prizes as an undergraduate. He completed his M.D. degree in 1845, becoming a [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] at the same time. In 1847, the college licensed him and his brother James to teach anatomy. The courses that they taught at the medical school in Argyle Square, Edinburgh were recognized by the examining bodies of England, Scotland and Ireland.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|77}}

He worked his way up at the Royal Infirmary from dresser (surgical assistant), to surgical clerk, to house [[physician]], house [[surgeon]] and finally full surgeon. His passion was for [[anatomy]]; he told the story of how he had been so concentrated on an anatomy [[dissection]] one day in 1843 that he failed to look outside to observe the street procession known as the "Disruption" which launched the [[Free Church of Scotland]]. He became Lecturer of Anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|77}}

In 1863, Struthers became the first [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the recently formed [[University of Aberdeen]].<ref name=GormanIntro>Gorman, Martyn, 2003. ''Introduction''</ref><ref name="NYTObit">{{cite news | title = Sir John Struthers Dead.; He Was Vice President of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 25 February 1899 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9404EFDC113CE433A25756C2A9649C94689ED7CF | accessdate = 21 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name=DNB>{{cite book | last = Lee | first = Sidney | title = Dictionary of National Biography | year = 1901 | publisher = Smith, Elder & Co | location = London}}</ref> This was a "Crown Chair" (a professorship recognized by the government), a prestigious position. Struthers' application for the chair was supported by over 250 letters, many from public figures including well-known doctors such as [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] and [[James Paget]], and politicians such as [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]], who became Home Secretary, and [[James Moncreiff, 1st Baron Moncreiff|James Moncreiff]], who became the Scottish Lord Advocate.<ref  group=note>The text says 'Lord Grey'; but [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]] had been prime minister until 1834. His younger brother [[Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet]] later became Home Secretary, but in 1839-40 he held other ministerial roles. James Moncreiff became Lord Advocate in 1851.</ref> The support of these men was actively solicited by Struthers' well-connected friends and relatives, including his cousin the Reverend John Struthers of [[Prestonpans]], and his energetic wife Christina. With the success of their campaign, the family moved to Aberdeen.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|77}}

Struthers held the professorship at Aberdeen for 26 years. In that time, he radically transformed anatomy teaching at the university, improved the Aberdeen medical school; set up the museum of anatomy; and helped to lead the reconstruction of the Aberdeen Infirmary. He vigorously collected specimens for his museum, "prepared or otherwise provided, mainly by the work of my own hands, and at my own expense". The specimens were arranged to enable students to [[Comparative anatomy|compare the anatomy]] of different animals. He intended the comparative anatomy exhibits to demonstrate [[evolution]] through the presence of [[Homology (biology)|homologous structures]]. For example, in [[mammals]], the arm and hand of a human, the [[wing (bird)|wing]] of a bird, the foreleg of a horse, and the [[Flipper (anatomy)|flipper]] of a whale are all homologous [[forelimb]]s. He continually made demands of the University of Aberdeen's Senate for additional room space and money for the museum, against the wishes of his colleagues in the faculty.<ref name=Whale/> Struthers could go to great lengths to obtain specimens he particularly wanted, and on at least one occasion this led to court action. He had long admired a [[crocodile]] skeleton at Aberdeen's Medico-Chirurgical Society. In 1866 he borrowed it, ostensibly to clean and remount it, but despite the society's urgent requests to have it returned, it stayed in Struthers' museum at Marischal College for ten years. Struthers still hoped to obtain the specimen, and when in 1885 he was made president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, he again tried to take the crocodile to his museum. The society then obtained an interdict (a court order) restraining him from removing the skeleton.<ref name=pmid1717373426>{{cite pmid|17373426}}</ref><ref name="pmid15712576">{{cite pmid|15712576}}</ref>

Struthers published about 70 papers on anatomy. He set up a popular series of lectures for the public, held on Saturday evenings.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|78}} Many of the methods he used remain relevant today. He had a powerful effect on medical education in Britain, in 1890 establishing the format of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching and examination in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. His system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. His 21st century successors at the anatomy school in Aberdeen write that "He would undoubtedly be greatly dismayed at the drastic reduction in the teaching of basic medical sciences, and the subsequent perceived decline in the anatomical knowledge of medical students and practicing clinicians," and they quote one of Struthers' sayings to his students:<ref name=pmid1717373426/><ref name=pmid15712576/>

===Evolution and Struthers' ligament===

[[File:Ligament of Struthers 1854.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration by Struthers of the "Ligament of Struthers", 1854<ref>Struthers, John, 1854. "On some points in the abnormal anatomy of the arm".</ref>]]

Struthers was one of the first advocates of the theory of [[evolution]], speaking publicly<ref>{{cite news | last = Struthers | first = John | title = Evolution | work = Aberdeen Daily Free Press | date = 24 February 1874 | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=image&itemID=CUL-DAR198.199&pageseq=1 | accessdate = 28 June 2008}}</ref> and corresponding with [[Charles Darwin]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4725.html | title = Darwin Correspondence Project&nbsp;– Letter 4725&nbsp;– Struthers, John to Darwin, C. R., 31 Dec 1864 | accessdate = 28 June 2008}}</ref> about observations he made during his [[comparative anatomy]] studies.

Struthers was interested in abnormal variations in anatomy, such as [[Polydactyly|additional toes]], and he collected many specimens which he offered to show Darwin. Among other curiosities, Struthers described the "[[Ligament of Struthers]]", a rare extra band of [[connective tissue]] present in 1% of humans running from a bony projection on the [[humerus]] down to the elbow,<ref name=AberdeenLigament/> and showed that its presence was inherited.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Struthers | first = John | year = 1863 | title = On the solid-hoofed pig; and on a case in which the fore foot of the horse presented two toes | journal = Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal | volume = 17 | pages = 273–80}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(00)63465-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi | 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)63384-7|noedit}}</ref><ref name=Ligament>Gorman, Martyn, 2003. ''Darwin & Struthers' Ligament''.</ref>

The significance of Struthers' ligament, as Darwin and Struthers understood, is that the [[vestigial]] organ has no function in humans, but is inherited from a structure, the supra-condyloid [[foramen]], which certainly had a function in other mammals including [[marsupials]] and [[carnivora|carnivores]]. In those other mammals, the supra-condyloid foramen is an opening in the bone that important structures, the [[median nerve]] and the [[brachial artery]], run through. Struthers observed that when his ligament was present in humans, the nerve and artery did run through it. Darwin took this to mean that humans and other mammals had a [[common ancestor]], and used Struthers' work as evidence in Chapter 1 of his ''[[Descent of Man]]'' (1871):<ref name=AberdeenLigament>{{cite web | url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/m.gorman/pages/struthers/ligament1.hti | title=The Zoology of Professor Struthers | publisher=University of Aberdeen | work=Charles Darwin and Struthers' ligament | accessdate=1 October 2012 | author=Gorman, Martyn}}</ref><ref name=Darwin>{{cite book |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |last=Darwin |first=Charles R. |year=1871 |publisher=John Murray |page=28 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=1 }}</ref>

{{quote|In some of the lower [[Quadrumana]], in the [[Lemuridae]] and [[Carnivora]], as well as in many [[marsupial]]s, there is a passage near the lower end of the humerus, called the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great nerve of the fore limb and often the great artery pass. Now in the humerus of man, there is generally a trace of this passage, which is sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by a depending hook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament. Dr. Struthers, who has closely attended to the subject, has now shewn that this peculiarity is sometimes inherited, as it has occurred in a father, and in no less than four out of his seven children. When present, the great nerve invariably passes through it; and this clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the supra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. [[William Turner (anatomist)|Prof. Turner]] estimates, as he informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent of recent skeletons. But if the occasional development of this structure in man is, as seems probable, due to reversion, it is a return to a very ancient state of things, because in the higher Quadrumana it is absent.<ref name=Darwin/><ref group=note>Darwin referenced this item in the ''Descent of Man'' as follows: "With respect to inheritance, see Dr. Struthers in the Lancet, Feb. 15, 1873, and another important paper, ibid., Jan. 24, 1863, p. 83. Dr. Knox, as I am informed, was the first anatomist who drew attention to this peculiar structure in man; see his Great Artists and Anatomists, p. 63. See also an important memoir on this process by Dr. Gruber, in the Bulletin de l'Acad. Imp. de St. Petersbourg, tom. xii., 1867, p. 448."</ref>}}

===Whale anatomy===

Aberdeen, a coastal city, gave Struthers the opportunity to observe the whales which were from time to time washed up on Scotland's coast. In 1870 he observed, dissected and described a [[Blue Whale]] (which he called a "Great Fin-Whale") from [[Peterhead]]. He brought the entire skeleton of a [[Sei Whale]] back to the anatomy department at Aberdeen, where for a century it was suspended overhead in the hall. He vigorously collected examples of a wide range of species to form a museum of zoology, with the intention of illustrating Darwin's theories. As an energetic and forceful personality with a strong enthusiasm for zoology, he alarmed his colleagues at the University of Aberdeen by constantly asking for money and space to acquire and house his collection.<ref name=Whale>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/zoohons/struthers/tay_whale.hti |title=Professor Struthers and the Tay Whale |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|8807706}}</ref>

===Dissecting the "Tay Whale"===

[[File:Megaptera Longimana 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of a [[humpback whale]]  by Struthers]]

Struthers became known to the general public for his dissection of the "[[Tay Whale]]" &mdash; one of his largest specimens. <ref name=Whale/>

At the end of December 1883, a [[humpback whale]] appeared in the [[Firth of Tay]] off [[Dundee]], attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at [[Stonehaven]], near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers was not able to start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.<ref name=Whale/>

Struthers was not allowed to dissect the famous specimen until it was too badly decomposed for further public exhibition.<ref  group=note>Dissection began on 25 January 1884.</ref> He was well used to working on stinking carcasses: his dissecting room was reputed to stink "like the deck of a Greenland [[whaler]]".<ref>Pennington, C. ''The modernisation of medical teaching at Aberdeen in the nineteenth century''. Aberdeen University Press, 1994.</ref> The dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public, for a fee, to watch Struthers and his assistants at work, with a military band playing in the background. Progress on the dissection was impeded by snow showers. Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh [[embalming|embalmed]]; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London. After months of waiting, on 7 August 1884, Struthers was able to remove the skull and the rest of the skeleton. Over the next decade, Struthers wrote seven anatomy articles on the whale, with a complete [[monograph]] on it in 1889.<ref name=Whale/>

==Life and family==

[[File:John Struthers family tree.jpg|thumb|200px|Family tree]]

Struthers married Christina Margaret Alexander (born 15 January 1833) on 5 August 1857. Christina was the sister of [[John Alexander (chief clerk)|John Alexander]], chief clerk to [[Bow Street Police Court]]. She too came from a Scottish medical family; her parents were [[wikisource:Author:James Alexander|Dr James Alexander]] (1795–1863) and Margaret Finlay (1797-1865), both of old Dunfermline families; James practised as a surgeon just across the English border in the small town of [[Wooler]], Northumberland.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|77}} On James' death as a "country practitioner", the city-dweller Struthers wrote<ref name=Memoir>Struthers, John. ''Memoir of Dr Alexander, Wooler''. 1863.</ref>

{{quote|The great majority of the profession are and must be country practitioners; the hardest work of the profession is done by them; in the winter nights, when the world is asleep, they have many a long and weary drive; they are far from libraries, from hospitals and museums, and from societies; and thus in their comparative isolation want that stimulus and guidance which tend to keep the city practitioner up to the mark.<ref name=Memoir/>}}

Struthers was father-in-law of [[nitroglycerine]] chemist [[David Orme Masson]], who married his daughter Mary. He was grandfather of another [[explosives]] chemist, [[Irvine Masson|Sir James Irvine Orme Masson]], and father-in-law of educator [[Simon Somerville Laurie]], who married his daughter Lucy.<ref>{{Cite document | author = Weickhardt, LW | contribution = Masson, Sir James Irvine Orme (1887–1962) | title = Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition | year = 2006 | issn = 1833-7538 | publisher = Australian National University | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100699b.htm }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Josipa Petrunic | title = Simon Somerville Laurie | work = [[Gifford Lectures]] | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | url = http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=107}}</ref>

===Retirement===
On retiring from the University of Aberdeen, Struthers returned to Edinburgh. He was buried in [[Warriston Cemetery]], Edinburgh, in 1899; his wife Christina joined him there in 1907. All three of their sons, Alexander, James and John also worked in the medical profession; John followed his father  by working at Leith hospital, then at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and finally by also becoming president of the Royal College of Surgeons.<ref name=Dunfermline/>{{rp|79}}
