'''Donor lymphocyte (''or leukocyte'') infusion (DLI)''' or '''buffy coat fusion''' is a form of [[adoptive immunotherapy]] used after [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].

==History==
Formerly, the only treatment option that offered [[relapse]]d [[bone marrow transplant]] patients hope of a cure was another bone marrow transplant. However, the risk of serious, life-threatening complications after a second [[bone marrow transplant|BMT]] is great. One strategy of managing relapse, donor leukocyte infusion, might eliminate the need for a second BMT in some patients.

==Procedure==
Donor leukocyte infusion is the [[infusion]] in which [[lymphocytes]] from the original stem cell donor are infused, after the transplant, to augment an anti-tumor immune response or ensure that the donor stem cells remain engrafted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Porter D, Levine JE |title=Graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-leukemia after donor leukocyte infusion |journal=Semin. Hematol. |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |year=2006 |pmid=16412789 |doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2005.09.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Loren AW, Porter DL |title=Donor leukocyte infusions after unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation |journal=Current opinion in oncology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=107–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16462177 |doi=10.1097/01.cco.0000208781.61452.d3}}</ref> These donated white blood cells contain cells of the [[immune system]] that can recognize and destroy cancer cells.

The goal of this therapy is to induce a remission of the patient's cancer by a process called the [[graft-versus-tumor]] effect (GVT). The donor [[T-cell]]s can attack and control the growth of residual cancer cells providing the GVT effect. It is hoped that the donor leukocyte infusion will cause GVT and lead to a remission of the patients cancer.

Patients might require standard [[chemotherapy]], to reduce the amount of cancer cells they have prior to their donor lymphocyte infusion.

==Complications==
Complications of DLI include acute and chronic [[graft-versus-host disease]] and [[bone marrow]] [[aplasia]], resulting in [[immunosuppression]] and susceptibility to [[opportunistic infection]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luznik L, Fuchs EJ |title=Donor lymphocyte infusions to treat hematologic malignancies in relapse after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation |journal=Cancer Control |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=123–37 |year=2002 |pmid=11965233 |doi=}}''[http://www.moffitt.org/moffittapps/ccj//v9n2/pdf/123.pdf Full text]''</ref>
