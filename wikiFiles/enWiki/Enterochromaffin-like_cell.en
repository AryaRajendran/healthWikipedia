'''Enterochromaffin-like cells''' or '''ECL cells''' are a type of [[neuroendocrine cell]]s found in the gastric glands of the [[gastric mucosa]] beneath the [[epithelium]], in particular in the vicinity of [[parietal cell]]s. They are also considered a type of [[enteroendocrine cells|enteroendocrine cell]].<ref>{{MeshName|Enterochromaffin-like+Cells}}</ref>

==Function==
[[Image:Histamine.png|thumb|left|[[Histamine]]]]
ECL cells synthesize and secrete [[histamine]].  These cells are stimulated by the hormones [[gastrin]] and [[pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide]].  G cells are stimulated by vagal stimulation through the neurotransmitter [[gastrin-releasing peptide]]; this causes the G cells to secrete gastrin, which in turn stimulates ECL cells to release histamine.  Note that this circuit is not activated by acetylcholine, which is of particular importance because the administration of atropine will not block the vagal stimulation of the G cells, as ACh is not the neurotransmitter for these cells. 

However, ECL cells are activated directly by ACh on M1 receptors from direct vagal innervation leading to histamine release. This pathway will be inhibited by atropine. <ref>http://jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/03_09/pdf/3_03_09_article.pdf</ref>

Gastrin is transferred from a specific type of [[G cell]] in the gastric epithelium to the ECL cells by [[blood]]. Histamine and gastrin act synergistically as the most important stimulators of [[hydrochloric acid]] secretion from parietal cells and stimulators of secretion of pepsinogen from [[chief cell]]s.  The most important inhibitor of the ECL cell is somatostatin from oxyntic D cells.

Enterochromaffin-like cells also produce [[pancreastatin]] and probably other [[peptide hormone]]s and [[growth factor]]s.

==Pathology==
A prolonged stimulation of these cells causes their [[hyperplasia]]. This is especially important in [[gastrinoma]] (the [[tumor]]s in which there is an excessive secretion of gastrin), as this is one of the factors contributing to [[Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome]]. It was once believed that tumors of ECL origin form after a prolonged inhibition of gastric acid secretion, however there is no data to support this conclusion and proton pump inhibitors are not thought to contribute to gastric cancer.

==Name==
The name is derived from their location in the enteric system and their [[Chromaffin cells|chromaffin]]-like staining pattern in [[histologic section]]s, which is characterized by [[staining (biology)#Silver staining|silver staining]].
