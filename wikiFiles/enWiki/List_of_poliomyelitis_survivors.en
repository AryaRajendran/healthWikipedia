<onlyinclude>This is a '''list of notable people who have survived the infectious disease poliomyelitis'''. [[Poliomyelitis]] (often simply called polio) is an acute [[virus|viral]] [[infectious disease|infection]] that involves the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and occasionally the [[central nervous system]]. [[Poliovirus]] is acquired by [[fecal-oral route|faecal-oral]] or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a [[polio vaccine|vaccine]] in 1955, infection was common, with [[epidemic]]s during the summer and autumn of [[temperate countries]]. An [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradication]] programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are [[asymptomatic]]; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in [[acute flaccid paralysis]]. The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to [[quadriplegia]] and [[respiratory failure]]. The latter was often treated with an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to [[post-polio syndrome]]. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.<ref>{{cite web

He was convinced that if the American people worked together to solve a problem, there was no obstacle that could not be conquered. In 1938, FDR established the March of Dimes, creating a network of volunteers and researchers that eventually yielded the Salk vaccine.
