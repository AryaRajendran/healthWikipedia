'''Chloracne''' is an [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]-like eruption of [[blackhead]]s, [[cyst]]s, and [[pustule]]s associated with over-exposure to certain [[halogen]]ated [[aromatic compound]]s, such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|chlorinated dioxins]] and [[dibenzofuran]]s. The lesions are most frequently found on the cheeks, behind the ears, in the armpits and groin region.

The condition was first described in German industrial workers in 1897 by von Bettman, and was initially believed to be caused by exposure to toxic [[chlorine]] (hence the name "chloracne"). It was only in the mid-1950s that chloracne was associated with aromatic hydrocarbons.<ref name="ref1">{{Cite web |author=Williams DE, Wolfe WH, Lustik MB, ''et al.'' |year=1995 |title=An Epidemiologic Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following Exposure to Herbicides |volume=4 |pages=427 |publisher= |id=A313403 |url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/31/3134/A313403.html }}</ref> The substances that may cause chloracne are now collectively known as '''chloracnegens'''.

Chloracne is particularly linked to toxic exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s (byproducts of many [[chemical process]]es, including the manufacture of [[herbicides]] such as [[Agent Orange]])&mdash;so much so that it is considered a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity and onset of chloracne may follow a typical [[asymptote|asymptotic]] [[dose-response relationship]] [[curve]].

==Etiology and progression==
Chloracne normally results from direct skin contact with chloracnegens, although ingestion and inhalation are also possible causative routes.

Chloracnegens are fat-soluble, meaning they persist in the body fat for a very long period following exposure. Chloracne is a chronic [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition that results from this persistence, in combination with the toxin's chemical properties. It is believed, at least from [[rodent]] models, that the toxin activates a series of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] promoting [[macrophage]] proliferation, inducing [[neutrophilia]] and leading to a generalised inflammatory response in the skin. This process may also be augmented by induction of excess [[Tumor necrosis factors|tumor necrosis factor]] in the blood [[blood plasma|serum]].

The inflammatory processes lead to the formation of [[keratin]]ous plugs in skin pores, forming yellowish cysts and dark pustules. The associated [[pus]] is usually greenish in color. The skin lesions occur mainly in the face, but in more severe cases they involve the shoulders and chest, the back, and the abdomen. In advanced cases, the lesions appear also on the arms, thighs, legs, hands and feet. 

In some instances, chloracne may not appear for three to four weeks after toxic exposure; however in other cases&mdash;particularly in events of massive exposure&mdash;the symptoms may appear within days.<ref name="ref1"/><ref name="ref2">{{cite journal |author=De Marchia B, Ravetzb JR |title=Risk management and governance: a post-normal science approach |journal=Futures |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=743–57 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0016-3287(99)00030-0}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Once chloracne has been identified, the primary action is to remove the patient and all other individuals from the source of contamination. Further treatment is [[symptomatic]].

Severe or persistent lesions may be treated with oral [[antibiotics]] or [[isotretinoin]]. However, chloracne may be highly resistant to any treatment.

The course of the disease is highly variable. In some cases the lesions may resolve within two years or so; however, in other cases the lesions may be effectively permanent (mean duration of lesions in one 1984 study was 26 years, with some workers remaining disfigured over three decades after exposure).<ref name="ref3">{{cite journal |author=Moses M, Lilis R, Crow KD, ''et al.'' |title=Health status of workers with past exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the manufacture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid: comparison of findings with and without chloracne |journal=Am.

Chloracne is very often seen in combination with [[hyperhidrosis]] (clammy, sweaty skin) and [[porphyria cutanea tarda]] (a skin condition of increased pigmentation, hair coarsening and blistering).
