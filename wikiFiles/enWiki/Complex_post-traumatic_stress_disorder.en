'''Complex post-traumatic stress disorder''' (C-PTSD) is a psychological injury that results from protracted exposure to prolonged social and/or interpersonal [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] in the context of either captivity or entrapment (a situation lacking a viable escape route for the victim), which results in the lack or loss of control, helplessness, and deformations of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and sense of [[self]]. C-PTSD is distinct from, but similar to, [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[somatization disorder]], [[dissociative identity disorder]], and [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref name="TAR">{{cite book|author=Judith L. Herman|title=Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence--From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3cn2R0KenN0C|accessdate=29 October 2012|date=30 May 1997|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08730-3}}</ref>  
 
However, C-PTSD was not accepted by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder. It was not included in DSM-IV and is not due to be included in DSM5, to be published in 2013.<ref name=dsm5>{{cite web|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees Approves DSM-5|url=http://dsmfacts.org/materials/american-psychiatric-association-board-of-trustees-approves-dsm-5/|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>

Though mainstream journals have published papers on C-PTSD, the category is not formally recognized in [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic systems]] such as [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD).<ref name="Roth1997">{{Cite pmid|9391940}}</ref> It may be included in the upcoming ICD 11 However, the former includes "disorder of extreme [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], not otherwise specified" and the latter has this similar code "personality change due to classifications found elsewhere" (31.1), both of whose parameters accommodate C-PTSD.<ref name="TAR" /> 

C-PTSD involves complex and reciprocal interactions between multiple [[biopsychosocial]] systems. It was first described in 1992 by [[Judith Lewis Herman|Judith Herman]] in her book ''Trauma & Recovery'' and an accompanying article.<ref name="TAR" /><ref name="Herman1992">{{cite DOI|10.1007/BF00977235}}</ref> Forms of trauma associated with C-PTSD include [[sexual abuse]] (especially [[child sexual abuse]]), [[physical abuse]], [[emotional abuse]], [[domestic violence]] or [[torture]]—all repeated traumas in which there is an actual or perceived inability for the victim to escape.<ref name="Freyd1997">{{cite doi|10.1177/0959353597071004}}</ref><ref name="Veldhuis1999">{{cite book |last1=Veldhuis |first1=C.B. |last2=Freyd |first2=J.J. |editor1-first=Margo |editor1-last=Rivera |title=[http://books.google.com/books/about/Fragment_by_Fragment.html?id=vRFSAAAACAAJ Fragment by fragment: feminist perspectives on memory and child sexual abuse] | publisher = Gynergy Books | location = Charlottetown, P.E.I | year = 1999 | isbn = 0921881509 | pages = 253–282 |chapter=Groomed for silence, groomed for betrayal. |chapterurl=http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/vf99.pdf}}</ref>

== Differential diagnosis ==

=== Posttraumatic stress disorder ===
{{main|Posttraumatic stress disorder}}
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was included in the [[Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#DSM-III_.281980.29|DSM-III]] (1980), mainly due to the relatively large numbers of American combat veterans of the [[Vietnam War]] who were seeking treatment for the lingering effects of combat stress. In the 1980s, various researchers and clinicians suggested that PTSD might also accurately describe the [[sequelae]] of such traumas as child sexual abuse and domestic abuse.<ref name="Courtois2004">{{cite doi|10.1037/0033-3204.41.4.412}}</ref> However, it was soon suggested that PTSD failed to account for the cluster of symptoms that were often observed in cases of prolonged abuse, particularly that which was perpetrated against [[children]] by [[caregiver]]s during multiple [[childhood development|childhood]] and [[adolescent development]]al stages. Such patients were often extremely difficult to treat with established methods.<ref name="Courtois2004" />

PTSD descriptions fail to capture some of the core characteristics of C-PTSD. These elements include captivity, psychological fragmentation, the loss of a sense of safety, trust, and self-worth, as well as the tendency to be [[revictimized]]. Most importantly, there is a loss of a coherent sense of self: it is this loss, and the ensuing symptom profile, that most pointedly differentiates C-PTSD from PTSD.<ref name="Herman97-199-122">Herman (1997), pp. 119–122</ref>

C-PTSD is also characterized by [[attachment disorder]], particularly the [[insecure attachment|pervasive insecure]], or [[disorganized attachment|disorganized-type attachment]].<ref name="vanderKolkRoth2005">{{cite pmid|16281237}}</ref> [[Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#DSM-IV_.281994.29|DSM-IV]] (1994) [[dissociative disorder]]s and PTSD do not include insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become [[parenting|parents]] and confront their own children's [[Attachment theory|attachment]] needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress—such as during routine separations, despite these parents' best intentions and efforts.<ref name="Schechter2008">{{cite pmid|18985165}}, pp. 123-149</ref> Although the great majority of survivors do not abuse others,<ref name="Kaufman1987">{{cite pmid|3296775}}</ref> this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's social and emotional development if parents with this condition and their children do not receive appropriate treatment.<ref name="Schechter2009">{{cite pmid|19486844}}</ref><ref name="Schechter2007">{{cite pmid|18007959}}</ref>

Thus, a differentiation between the diagnostic category of C-PTSD and that of PTSD has been suggested. C-PTSD better describes the pervasive negative impact of chronic repetitive trauma than does PTSD alone.<ref name="vanderKolkCourtois2005">{{cite pmid|16281236}}</ref><ref name="NCPTSD">{{cite web |url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/pages/complex-ptsd.asp |title=Complex PTSD |year=2007 |publisher=[[United States Department of Veteran Affairs]] |work=[http://www.ptsd.va.gov/ National Center for PTSD]}}</ref> 

C-PTSD also differs from Continuous Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (CTSD) which was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The Continuous Traumatic Stress Syndrome. The Single 
Therapeutic Interview.|journal=Psychology in Society|year=1987|issue=8 |pages=46–79}}</ref> It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with [[Civil war|civil conflict]] and [[political repression]]. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which [[gang violence]] and [[crime]] are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in [[Occupational safety and health|high-risk occupations]] such as [[Emergency service|police, fire and emergency services]].

If a person dies, and the survivor was close to the person who died, then it is more likely that symptoms of [[grief]] will also develop. When the death is of a loved one, and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. This is likely in children exposed to community violence.<ref name="PynoosNader1988">{{cite doi|10.1002/jts.2490010406}}</ref><ref name = "NCTSNFirstAid">{{cite web |url=http://nctsnet.org/nctsn_assets/pdfs/edu_materials/psychological_1st_aid.pdf |title=Psychological First Aid |publisher=[http://nctsnet.org/ National Child Traumatic Stress Network] |work=Adapted from Pynoos, R. S.; Nader, K. (1988). "Psychological first aid and treatment approach to children exposed to community violence: Research implications". Journal of Traumatic Stress 1 (4): 445.}}</ref>

For C-PTSD to manifest, the violence would occur under conditions of captivity, loss of control and disempowerment, coinciding with the death of a friend or loved one in life threatening circumstances. This again is most likely for children and stepchildren who experience prolonged domestic or chronic community violence that ultimately results in the death of friends and loved ones. The phenomenon of the increased risk of violence and death of [[stepchild]]ren is referred to as the [[Cinderella effect]].

=== Attachment theory, BPD and C-PTSD ===
{{main|Attachment theory|Borderline personality disorder}}
C-PTSD may share some symptoms with both PTSD and borderline personality disorder.<ref name="vanderKolkCourtois2005" /> Judith Herman has suggested that C-PTSD be used in place of BPD.<ref name="Johnson2011">{{cite book|author=Susan M. Johnson|title=Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy with Trauma Survivors|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5RgQ51waJhUC |page=75 |accessdate=28 October 2012|date=3 November 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0435-0}}</ref><ref name="DESNOS1">{{cite journal |last=Luxenberg |first=Toni |last2=Spinazzola |first2=Joseph |last3=van der Kolk |first3=Bessel A.|year=2001 |title=Complex Trauma and Disorders of Extreme Stress (DESNOS) Diagnosis, Part One: Assessment |journal=Directions in Psychiatry |volume=21 |chapter=25 |page=373 |publisher=The Hatherleigh Company |url=http://www.aisjca-mft.org/desnos.pdf }}</ref><ref name="DESNOS2">{{cite journal |last=Luxenberg |first=Toni |last2=Spinazzola |first2=Joseph |last3=van der Kolk |first3=Bessel A.|year=2001 |title=Complex Trauma and Disorders of Extreme Stress (DESNOS) Diagnosis, Part Two: Treatment|journal=Directions in Psychiatry |volume=21 |chapter=26 |page=395 |publisher=The Hatherleigh Company |url=http://www.aisjca-mft.org/desnos.pdf }}</ref>

It may help to understand the intersection of attachment theory with C-PTSD and BPD if one reads the following opinion of Bessel A. van der Kolk together with an understanding drawn from a description of BPD:
<blockquote>
Uncontrollable disruptions or distortions of attachment bonds precede the development of post-traumatic stress syndromes. People seek increased attachment in the face of danger. Adults, as well as children, may develop strong emotional ties with people who intermittently [[harassment|harass]], beat, and, threaten them. The persistence of these attachment bonds leads to confusion of pain and love. Trauma can be repeated on behavioural, emotional, [[physiology|physiologic]], and [[Neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrinologic]] levels. Repetition on these different levels causes a large variety of individual and social suffering.

[[Anger]] directed against the self or others is always a central problem in the lives of people who have been violated and this is itself a repetitive re-enactment of real events from the past. Compulsive repetition of the trauma usually is an [[unconscious]] process that, although it may provide a temporary sense of mastery or even pleasure, ultimately perpetuates chronic feelings of helplessness and a subjective sense of being bad and out of control. Gaining control over one's current life, rather than repeating trauma in action, mood, or somatic states, is the goal of healing.<ref name="vanderKolk1989">{{cite pmid|2664732}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Seeking increased attachment to people, especially to care-givers who inflict pain,  confuses love and pain and increases the likelihood of a captivity like that of betrayal bonding,<ref name="Carnes1997">{{cite book|author=Patrick Carnes|title=The Betrayal Bond: Breaking Free of Exploitive Relationships|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pEdMu4JVsc8C|accessdate=28 October 2012|year=1997|publisher=HCI|isbn=978-1-55874-526-1}}</ref> (similar to [[Stockholm syndrome]]) and of disempowerment and lack of control. If the situation is perceived as life threatening then traumatic stress responses will likely arise and C-PTSD more likely diagnosed in a situation of insecure attachment than PTSD.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

However, 25% of those diagnosed with BPD have no history of childhood neglect or abuse and individuals are six times as likely to develop BPD if they have a relative who was so diagnosed{{Citation needed|reason=March 10|date=March 2009}} compared to those who do not. One conclusion is that there is a genetic predisposition to BPD unrelated to trauma. Researchers conducting a longitudinal investigation of identical twins found that "genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features in Western society."<ref name ="Distel2008">{{cite pmid|17988414}}</ref>

== Diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV==
{{main|Posttraumatic stress disorder}} 
C-PTSD was under consideration for inclusion in the DSM-IV but was not included when it the DSM-IV was published in 1994.<ref name="TAR" />
In DSM5, due to be published in 2013, it will not be included. PTSD will continue to be listed as a disorder.<ref name=dsm5>{{cite web|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees Approves DSM-5|url=http://dsmfacts.org/materials/american-psychiatric-association-board-of-trustees-approves-dsm-5/|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>

# ''Attachment'' - "problems with relationship boundaries, lack of trust, social isolation, difficulty perceiving and responding to other's emotional states, and lack of empathy"
# ''Biology'' - "sensory-motor developmental dysfunction, sensory-integration difficulties, somatization, and increased medical problems"
# ''Affect or emotional regulation'' - "poor affect regulation, difficulty identifying and expressing emotions and internal states, and difficulties communicating needs, wants, and wishes"
# ''Dissociation'' - "amnesia, [[depersonalization]], discrete [[states of consciousness]] with discrete memories, affect, and functioning, and impaired memory for state-based events"
# ''Behavioural control'' - "problems with [[impulse control]], [[aggression]], pathological self-soothing, and [[Sleep disorder|sleep problems]]"
# ''Cognition'' - "difficulty regulating [[attention]], problems with a variety of "[[executive functions]]" such as planning, judgement, initiation, use of materials, and self-monitoring, difficulty [[Information processing|processing new information]], difficulty focusing and completing tasks, poor [[object constancy]], problems with "cause-effect" thinking, and language developmental problems such as a gap between receptive and expressive communication abilities."
# ''Self-concept'' -"fragmented and disconnected autobiographical narrative, disturbed [[body image]], low [[self-esteem]], excessive [[shame]], and negative internal working models of self".

=== Adult symptom cluster ===

Adults with C-PTSD have sometimes experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization as children as well as prolonged trauma as adults. This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense of self and of others. Because physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop a sense that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.<ref name="Herman1992" /><ref name="Zlotnick1996">{{cite doi|10.1007/BF02110655}}</ref>

This can become a pervasive way of relating to others in adult life described as insecure attachment. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder and PTSD in the current [[Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#DSM-IV-TR_.282000.29|DSM-IV TR]] (2000) do not include insecure attachment as a symptom. Individuals with Complex PTSD also demonstrate lasting personality disturbances with a significant risk of revictimization.<ref name="Ide2000">{{cite pmid|11232103}}</ref>

Six clusters of symptom have been suggested for diagnosis of C-PTSD.<ref name="Roth1997" /><ref name="Pelcovitz1997">{{cite pmid|9018674}}</ref> These are (1) alterations in regulation of affect and impulses; (2) alterations in attention or consciousness; (3) alterations in self-perception; (4) alterations in relations with others; (5) somatization, and (6) alterations in systems of meaning.<ref name="Pelcovitz1997" />

Experiences in these areas may include:<ref name="Herman97-199-122" /><ref name="NCPTSD" />

*[[Emotional dysregulation|Difficulties regulating emotions]], including symptoms such as [[dysthymia|persistent sadness]], suicidal thoughts, explosive anger, or [[Passive–aggressive behavior|covert anger]].

*Variations in consciousness, such as forgetting traumatic events (i.e., psychogenic amnesia), reliving traumatic events, or having episodes of dissociation (during which one feels detached from one's mental processes or body).

*Changes in self-perception, such as a chronic and pervasive sense of helplessness, shame, guilt, stigma, and a sense of being completely different from other human beings.

*Varied changes in the perception of the perpetrator, such as attributing total power to the perpetrator or becoming preoccupied with the relationship to the perpetrator, including a preoccupation with revenge.

*Alterations in relations with others, including isolation, distrust, or a repeated search for a rescuer.

*Loss of, or changes in, one's system of meanings, which may include a loss of sustaining faith or a sense of hopelessness and despair.

== Treatment ==

=== For adults ===
Herman believes recovery from C-PTSD occurs in three stages. These are: establishing safety, remembrance and mourning for what was lost, and reconnecting with community and more broadly, society. Herman believes recovery can only occur within a healing relationship and only if the survivor is empowered by that relationship. This healing relationship need not be romantic or sexual in the colloquial sense of "relationship", however, and can also include relationships with friends, co-workers, one's relatives or children, and the [[therapeutic relationship]].<ref name="TAR" />

Complex trauma means complex reactions and this leads to complex treatments. Hence treatment for C-PTSD requires a multi-modal approach.<ref name="Cook2005">{{cite journal | author = Cook, A. | coauthors = Blaustein, M.; Spinazzola, J.; Van Der Kolk, B. | year = 2005 | title = Complex trauma in children and adolescents | journal = Psychiatric Annals | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 390–398 | url = http://doi.apa.org/?uid=2005-05449-004  | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}</ref>  It has been suggested that treatment for C-PTSD should differ from treatment for PTSD by focusing on problems that cause more functional impairment than the PTSD symptoms.  These problems include emotional dysregulation, dissociation, and interpersonal problems.<ref name="vanderKolkRoth2005" /> Six suggested core components of complex trauma treatment include:<ref name="Cook2005" />

# Safety
# Self-regulation
# Self-reflective information processing
# Traumatic experiences integration
# Relational engagement
# Positive affect enhancement

Multiple treatments have been suggested for C-PTSD.  Among these treatments are experiential and [[emotionally focused therapy]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|internal family systems therapy]], [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]], [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] therapy (EMDR)], [[Dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT),  [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[family therapy|family systems therapy]] and [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]].<ref>Courtois & Ford (2009)</ref>

=== For children ===
The utility of PTSD derived psychotherapies for assisting children with C-PTSD is uncertain. This area of diagnosis and treatment calls for caution in use of the category C-PTSD. Ford and van der Kolk have suggested that C-PTSD may not be as useful a category for diagnosis and treatment of children as a proposed category of [[developmental trauma disorder]] (DTD).<ref>Courtois & Ford (2009), p. 60</ref> For DTD to be diagnosed it requires a
<blockquote>
'history of exposure to early life developmentally adverse interpersonal trauma such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, violence, traumatic losses of other significant disruption or betrayal of the child's relationships with primary caregivers, which has been postulated as an etiological basis for complex traumatic stress disorders. Diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome are always relational.'<ref>Courtois & Ford (2009), ch. 3</ref>
</blockquote>

Since C-PTSD or DTD in children is often caused by chronic maltreatment, neglect or abuse in a care-giving relationship the first element of the biopsychosocial system to address is that relationship. This invariably involves some sort of child protection agency. This both widens the range of support that can be given to the child but also the complexity of the situation, since the agency's statutory legal obligations may then need to be enforced. 

A number of practical, therapeutic and ethical principles for assessment and intervention have been developed and explored in the field:<ref>Courtois & Ford (2009), p. 67</ref>
* Identifying and addressing threats to the child's or family's safety and stability are the first priority.
* A relational bridge must be developed to engage, retain and maximize the benefit for the child and caregiver.
* Diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome monitoring are always relational (and) strengths based.
* All phases of treatment should aim to enhance self-regulation competencies.
* Determining with whom, when and how to address traumatic memories.
* Preventing and managing relational discontinuities and psychosocial crises.
