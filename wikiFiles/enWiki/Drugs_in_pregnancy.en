'''Drugs used during pregnancy''' can have temporary or permanent effects on the fetus. Any [[drug]] that acts during embryonic or fetal development to produce a permanent alteration of form or function is known as a [[teratogen]].

==Prescribing for the pregnant woman==

Many physicians would prefer not to prescribe drugs for pregnant women due to concerns over teratogenicity. The apprehension is not necessarily data driven, and is a cautionary response to the lack of clinical studies in pregnant women. In some cases, the use of drugs in pregnancy carries benefits that outweigh the risks. For example, high fever is harmful for the fetus in the early months, thus the use of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) is generally associated with lower risk than the fever itself. Similarly, diabetes mellitus during pregnancy may need intensive therapy with insulin to prevent complications to mother and baby.<ref name="reena shaji">[http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/525/drugs-pregnancy-and-teratogenicity Drugs in Pregnancy & Teratogenicity], Reena Shaji,MD.Obstetrics & Gynecology</ref>

==Period of drug use==

Pregnancy and development of fetus progresses through various changes. The period of one week from [[fertilisation]] to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of the fertilized [[zygote|egg]] is called the preimplantation period. This is an 'all or none' period, .i.e. an insult can either cause death or complete recovery can occur.
The period from the 8th day to the end of 8th week (2nd month) is the period of [[organogenesis]] during which the organs are formed in the fetus. This is the most crucial time with regard to 'structural malformations' and concern over teratogenicity of drugs. From the 3rd month week to the end of 9 months is the period of fetal maturation. Intake of drugs during this period may modify the 'function' of the fetal organs rather than causing gross structural malformations in the fetus; for example, [[aminoglycosides]] can affect the functioning of the kidneys as well as the hearing mechanism.

==Categories of drugs==

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has developed a [[Pregnancy category|rating system]] to provide therapeutic guidance based on potential benefits and fetal risks. Drugs have been classified into categories A, B, C, D and X based on this system of classification. Drugs, and some multivitamins, that have demonstrated no fetal risks after controlled studies in humans are classified as Category A, while drugs like thalidomide with proven fetal risks that outweigh all benefits are classified as Category X.
