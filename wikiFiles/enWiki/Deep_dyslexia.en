'''Deep dyslexia ''' is a form of [[alexia (condition)|alexia]] that disrupts [[Reading (process)|reading processes]] that were functioning normally before the individual suffered a [[Traumatic brain injury|head trauma]] to the dominant [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] (usually left). Deep [[dyslexia]] may occur as a result of a [[head injury]], [[stroke]], [[Neurological disorder|disease]], or [[Neurosurgery|operation]].<ref name=Harley>{{cite book| last=Harley| first=Trevor A.| title=The psychology of language: from data to theory| publisher=Taylor & Francis| year=2001| pages=189–195| isbn=978-0-86377-867-4 |oclc = 469913878 }}</ref> This injury results in the occurrence of [[Semantics|semantic]] errors during reading and the impairment of nonword reading.<ref name= "Colangelo" /><ref name= "Buchanan">{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Lori|coauthors=McEwen, Shannon; Westbury, Chris; Libben, Gary|title=Semantics and semantic errors: Implicit access to semantic information from words and nonwords in deep dyslexia|journal=Brain and Language|date=2003|volume=84|issue=1|pages=65–83|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(02)00521-7|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

The term [[dyslexia]] comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ‘dys’ meaning ‘impaired’, and ‘lexis’ meaning ‘word’ and is used to describe disorders of language concerning reading and [[spelling]].

Numerous models and hypotheses have been proposed in attempt to explain the broad range of symptoms experienced by deep dyslexics, but a definite consensus has yet to be reached. The proposed models and hypotheses have helped in treatment of some suffering patients, but only with certain specific symptoms. Additionally, the recovery seen is not experienced equally in all patients.

Deep dyslexia is usually classified as an [[Alexia (condition)|acquired reading disorder]], as opposed to a [[developmental dyslexia]], in previously literate adults as a consequence of a [[brain injury]].<ref name= "Colangelo">{{cite journal|last=Colangelo|first=Annette|coauthors=Buchanan, Lori|title=Localizing damage in the functional architecture: The distinction between implicit and explicit processing in deep dyslexia|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|date=2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=111–144|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2006.08.001|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref><ref name= "Colangelokaren">{{cite journal|last=Colangelo|first=Annette|coauthors=Buchanan, Lori|title=Implicit and explicit processing in deep dyslexia: Semantic blocking as a test for failure of inhibition in the phonological output lexicon|journal=Brain and Language|date=2006|volume=99|issue=3|pages=258–271|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2005.07.048}}</ref><ref name= "Temple">{{cite journal|last=Temple|first=CM|title=Developmental and acquired dyslexias.|journal=Cortex|date=2006|volume=42|issue=6|pages=898-910|pmid=17131596}}</ref><ref name= "Coslett">{{cite journal|last=Coslett|first=HB|title=Acquired dyslexia.|journal=Seminars in neurology|date=2000|volume=20|issue=4|pages=419-26|pmid=11149697}}</ref> However, recently, developmental deep dyslexia has also been reported in children with [[Williams syndrome|Williams Syndrome]].<ref name= "Temple" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=RS|title=Developmental deep dyslexia?|journal=Cortex|date=1983|volume=19|issue=1|pages=133-9|pmid=6851588}}</ref>

Deep dyslexia is considered to be a "[[central dyslexia]]" as compared to a "[[peripheral dyslexia]]". Peripheral dyslexics have difficulty matching the visual characteristics of letters that comprise a word to a stored memory of this word from prior encounters.<ref name= "Coslett" /> Central dyslexics are unable to properly match the visual word to the word's meaning.<ref name= "Coslett" /> They may also be incapable of speaking, or [[Phonation|phonating]], the sequence of written letters that they see into the word these letters represent.<ref name= "Coslett" /> Deep dyslexia differs from other forms of central dyslexia ([[Phonological dyslexia|phonological dyslexia]] and [[Surface dyslexia|surface dyslexia]]) in that deep dyslexics have many more symptoms and these symptoms are generally more severe.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Rapcsak">{{cite journal|last=Rapcsak|first=Steven Z.|coauthors=Beeson, Pélagie M.; Henry, Maya L.; Leyden, Anne; Kim, Esther; Rising, Kindle; Andersen, Sarah; Cho, HyeSuk|title=Phonological dyslexia and dysgraphia: Cognitive mechanisms and neural substrates|journal=Cortex|date=2009|volume=45|issue=5|pages=575–591|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.04.006}}</ref><ref name= "Orden">{{cite journal|last=Van Orden|first=G|title=What do double dissociations prove?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=2001|volume=25|issue=1|pages=111–172|doi=10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00036-7}}</ref> According to the “continuum” hypothesis, deep dyslexia is a more severe form of phonological dyslexia.<ref name= "Rapcsak" /><ref name= "Orden" /><ref name= "Lambon">{{cite journal|last=Lambon Ralph|first=Matthew A.|coauthors=Graham, Naida L.|title=Acquired phonological and deep dyslexia|journal=Neurocase|date=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages=141–178|doi=10.1080/13554790008402767}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

Deep dyslexia is mainly characterized by the occurrence of [[Semantics|semantic]] reading errors or semantic [[paralexias]] (transposition of letters or words) when reading aloud (e.g. the written word "view" is read aloud as “scene“, the word "bird" is read as “canary”).<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Plaut">{{cite journal|last=Plaut|first=David C.|coauthors=Shallice, Tim|title=Deep dyslexia: A case study of connectionist neuropsychology|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1993|volume=10|issue=5|pages=377–500|doi=10.1080/02643299308253469}}</ref><ref name= "Weekes">{{cite journal|last=Weekes|first=Brendan|coauthors=Coltheart, Max; Gordon, Evian|title=Deep dyslexia and right hemisphere reading-a regional cerebral blood flow study|journal=Aphasiology|date=1997|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1139–1158|doi=10.1080/02687039708249437}}</ref> These semantic errors are the major distinguishing feature of deep dyslexia in comparison to other central dyslexias.<ref name= "Coslett" /> There are many other symptoms of deep dyslexia, including visual errors (e.g. the written word "thing" is read aloud as “think”, the word "skate" is read as “scale”) and deviational errors (e.g. the written word "alcohol" is read aloud as "alcoholic", the word "governor" is read as "government"), and poor reading of [[Function word|function words]].<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Plaut" /><ref name= "Weekes" /> Additionally, deep dyslexics have more difficulty reading [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] than [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and highly imaginable words, more difficulty reading [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[verb]]s than [[noun]]s, a complete inability to read [[Pseudoword|non-words]], and often impairments on tasks of verbal [[working memory]].<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Plaut" /><ref name= "Weekes" /><ref name= "Harley book">{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Trevor|title=The psychology of language : from data to theory|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Hove|isbn=978-0-86377-867-4|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=Bryan|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0-7167-9586-8|edition=6th ed.|coauthors=Whishaw, Ian Q.}}</ref> 

While the symptoms of deep dyslexia listed above are different and independent impairments of reading, it is rare to find an individual who only displays some of the characteristics of it; indeed, most patients presenting with semantic paralexias, a hallmark symptom of the disorder, also demonstrate all of the other symptoms.<ref name= "Weekes" /><ref name= "Coltheartmax">{{cite book|last=Coltheart|first=Edited by Max|title=*Deep dyslexia.|year=1980|publisher=Routhledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-0456-7|edition=[1st publ.].|coauthors=Patterson, Karalyn; Marshall, John C.}}</ref> This has resulted in deep dyslexia being considered a symptom-complex and has led to much research into why this variety of symptoms may co-occur in so many patients.<ref name= "Weekes" /><ref name= "Coltheartmax" />

===Imageability effect and ease of predication===

The difficulty of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has been referred to as the "[[imageability]] effect".<ref name= "Temple" /><ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Jones">{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=GV|title=Deep dyslexia, imageability, and ease of predication.|journal=Brain and language|date=1985|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1-19|pmid=3971130}}</ref><ref name= "Riley">{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=EA|coauthors=Thompson, CK|title=Semantic Typicality Effects in Acquired Dyslexia: Evidence for Semantic Impairment in Deep Dyslexia.|journal=Aphasiology|date=2010|volume=24|issue=6-8|pages=802-813|pmid=20657815}}</ref> According to this idea, the ease with which a [[mental image]] can be created for a word is strongly related to the ease of reading the word.<ref name= "Jones" /> In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the ease of reading it.<ref name= "Jones" /> This variable, [[ease of predication]], is a rating of how easy it is to come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word.<ref name= "Jones" /><ref name= "Harley2">{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=Trevor A.|title=Connectionist approaches to language disorders|journal=Aphasiology|date=1993|volume=7|issue=3|pages=221–249|doi=10.1080/02687039308249508}}</ref> For example, when presented with the word "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]], such as "has four legs", "is an animal", or "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher ease of predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower ease of predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between ease of predication and ease of reading seen in normal adult readers.<ref name= "Jones" /><ref name= "Harley2" /> Ease of predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.<ref name= "Jones" />

==Mechanism==

There are many different, and often conflicting, hypotheses that attempt to explain the deficits associated with deep dyslexia.<ref name= "Shallice">{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}</ref> These theories have resulted in several models designed to conceptualize the symptom-complex found in deep dyslexics. These models are not ordered chronologically, but rather follow a general increasing trend of presence in the field of knowledge regarding deep dyslexics. Some models may be stronger than others, but that is not necessarily reflected here. Models and hypothesis toward the end of the list are more heavily debated and thus typically have a greater wealth of knowledge surrounding their topic.<ref name = "Colangelo" />

===Continuum model===

The "Glosser and Friedman (continuum) model" is based upon the concept that deep dyslexia and phonological dyslexia are opposite endpoints on a “continuum” of reading disability.<ref name= "Colangelo" /><ref name= "Friedman">{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|title=Recovery from Deep Alexia to Phonological Alexia: Points on a Continuum|journal=Brain and Language|date=1996|volume=52|issue=1|pages=114–128|doi=10.1006/brln.1996.0006|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> Deep dyslexia appears to be a more severe form of phonological dyslexia;<ref name= "Rapcsak" /><ref name= "Orden" /><ref name= "Lambon" /> however, symptoms in patients can change over time so that an initial diagnosis of deep dyslexia is later better described as strictly a phonological dyslexia.<ref name= "Colangelo" /> These observations suggest recovery is possible along the [[semantic pathway]].<ref name= "Colangelo" />

===Connectionist model===

[[File:Connectionist model of deep dyslexia.png|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexics have sufficient activation of a written word's features; but, this activation decays quickly, leading to errors in speech output.]]
The "connectionist model" suggests that the phonological and semantic features of a word are [[Spreading activation|activated]], but this activation decays at a rate too quick for cognitive processing- thus, errors in speech output are produced as a result of this fading activation.<ref name= "Colangelo" /><ref name= "Buchanan" /> This hypothesis explains the broad symptom-complex of deep dyslexics without resorting to a multiple loci damage approach as seen in other models.<ref name= "Colangelo" /><ref name= "Buchanan" /> It eliminates the need to attribute a specific locus of damage to each symptom of deep dylsexia, and instead states that all symptoms are due to decay of a large activation area.<ref name= "Colangelo" /><ref name= "Buchanan" />

===Failure of inhibition hypothesis===

The "failure of inhibition hypothesis" states that the presentation of a target word activates [[semantic memory]] of that word, along with memory for other words that are semantically related.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> For example, the target word “dog” may activate “bark”, “cat”, “squirrel”, “ball”, “fetch”. Deep dyslexic patients are unable to inhibit the other related words, so they are likely to substitute one of these words for the target word in speech production (explicit output).<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> This hypothesis contradicts the belief of other researchers that the deficits seen in deep dyslexics are due to [[Mental process|processing]] problems. 

Researchers believe that "failure of inhibition" has no effect on [[Implicit learning|implicit]] processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading).<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process.  Implicit knowledge involves [[phonological awareness]], understanding of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and a semantic understanding of written words.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of "failure of inhibition" show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a [[lexical decision task]] with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and [[phonics]] to process the words.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud).<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /> This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from [[Broca’s aphasia]].<ref name= "Lambon" />

===Dual route model===

[[File:Dual route model and deep dyslexia diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexia can affect both pathways in the dual-route hypothesis of reading.]]
{{main|The Dual-Route Hypothesis to Reading}}
The "Morton and Patterson (dual route) model" is based upon the [[The Dual-Route Hypothesis to Reading|dual route hypothesis of reading]]. It proposes that the occurrence of semantic errors alongside an inability to read non-words aloud must be due to multiple loci of damage within this dual-route model.<ref name= "Colangelo" /> Because a deep dyslexic cannot read aloud non-words, a disruption in the [[Phonology|phonological]] process is assumed, forcing reading to proceed through the semantic route.<ref name= "Colangelo" /> However, deep dyslexics also produce semantic errors while reading, alluding to damage in this pathway as well.<ref name= "Colangelo" /> Other researchers refer to the phonological and semantic route as "modules".<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /><ref name= "Orden" /> They believe that patients have a partially functioning [[Lexicon|lexical]] module and a completely deficient nonlexical module.<ref name= "Orden" /> The lexical module is analogous to the semantic route in the dual route model and relies on lexical memory, or the memory for words, to name words.<ref name= "Colangelokaren" /><ref name= "Orden" /> In using the lexical module, an individual accesses a "mental dictionary" of words. The nonlexical module is comparable to the phonological route and uses knowledge of spelling and [[Grapheme|graphemes]] to create [[Phoneme|phonemes]] to name words and nonwords.<ref name= "Orden" /> The absent nonlexical module in deep dyslexics explains why patients cannot name nonwords.<ref name= "Orden" />

===Right and left hemisphere hypotheses===
[[File:HearReadBrain.png|thumb|Activation areas in the left hemisphere when hearing or reading a word. The "left-hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system.]]

Normal reading is typically a function of a left [[Lateralization of brain function|hemisphere-based system]].<ref name= "Coslett" /> The right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] plays a minimal role in reading.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Shallice" /> One hypothesis, the "left hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system associated with deep dyslexia.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Coltheart">{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|title=Deep Dyslexia Is Right-Hemisphere Reading|journal=Brain and Language|date=2000|volume=71|issue=2|pages=299–309|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2183}}</ref><ref name= "Salmelin">{{cite journal|last=Salmelin|first=R|coauthors=Helenius, P; Service, E|title=Neurophysiology of fluent and impaired reading: a magnetoencephalographic approach.|journal=Journal of clinical neurophysiology|date=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163-74|pmid=10831107}}</ref> Deep dyslexics may be attempting to use this damaged left hemisphere, resulting in severe reading deficits.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Coltheart" /><ref name= "Salmelin" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Warrington|first=Rosaleen A. McCarthy, Elizabeth K.|title=Cognitive neuropsychology : a clinical introduction|year=1990|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0124818463|edition=[7. Nachdr.]}}</ref>  On the other hand, the "right hemisphere hypothesis" states that deep dyslexics attempt to read using a completely different reading system.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Shallice" /><ref name= "Coltheart" /> According to this hypothesis, they are using the right hemisphere for [[Orthography|orthographic]] and semantic processing, but given that this system does not usually play a role in reading, deep dyslexics have many reading disabilities.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Coltheart" /> Strong support for this hypothesis comes from studies of [[split-brain]] patients who use the right hemisphere for reading. These patients makes semantic errors similar to those seen with deep dyslexia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page= 112|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}</ref> Numerous studies have shown that the right hemisphere ''can'' contribute to reading when a patient's left hemisphere is damaged.<ref name= "Coslett" /><ref name= "Shallice" /> Brain imaging studies, performed both on deep dyslexics and in other patients with left hemisphere injury, have shown that the damaged left hemisphere is still playing a role in reading.<ref name= "Coltheart" /><ref name= "Salmelin" /> However, the imaging has also shown that areas of the right hemisphere are also active during reading.<ref name= "Coltheart" /><ref name= "Salmelin" /> Thus, it currently appears that there is greater support in favor of the right-hemisphere hypothesis. <ref name = "Coltheart" />

==Treatment==
There have been many different studies done in an attempt to treat deep dyslexics, all which have been met with varying success. One method that has been frequently used is to teach patients to sound out words using grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence rules (for example, using single letter graphemes such as the letter 'B" to link with larger words such as "Baby", allowing for association of phonemes).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|coauthors=Lott, Susan Nitzberg|title=Successful blending in a phonological reading treatment for deep alexia|journal=Aphasiology|date=2002|volume=16|issue=3|pages=355–372|doi=10.1080/02687040143000627}}</ref> Such methods are known as "non-lexically based reading treatments". Other studies have looked at attempting to repair the semantic-lexical route, known as "lexically based treatment".<ref name= "Rilling">{{cite journal|last=Stadie|first=Nicole|coauthors=Rilling, Eva|title=Evaluation of lexically and nonlexically based reading treatment in a deep dyslexic|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=643–672|doi=10.1080/02643290500538364|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> Regardless of the methodology, treatment studies with deep dyslexics are difficult because much of the information regarding this disability is still heavily debated.{{cn|date=April 2013}} Treatment options may be successful on repairing one route of reading but not another, and success for one patient may not translate to success in another.{{cn|date=April 2013}}
