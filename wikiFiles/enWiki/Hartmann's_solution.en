'''Hartmann's solution''' or '''compound sodium lactate''' is a crystalloid solution that is most closely [[Tonicity|isotonic]] with [[blood]] and intended for [[intravenous therapy|intravenous administration]].
Hartmann's IV Infusion is used to
replace body fluid and mineral salts
that may be lost for a variety of
medical reasons.  Hartmann's IV
Infusion is especially suitable when
the losses result in too much acid
being present in the blood.
Hartmann's solution is abbreviated as "CSL". It is very similar&mdash;though not identical to&mdash;[[lactated Ringer's solution]], the ionic concentrations of which differ.

==Overview==
One litre of Hartmann's solution contains:<ref name=frca>http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=291</ref>
* 131 [[milliequivalent|mEq]] of [[sodium]] [[ion]] = 131 [[Molarity#Molarity|mmol/L]].
* 111 mEq of [[chloride]] ion = 111&nbsp;mmol/L.
* 29 mEq of [[lactic acid|lactate]] = 29&nbsp;mmol/L.
* 5 mEq of [[potassium]] ion = 5&nbsp;mmol/L.
* 4 mEq of [[calcium]] ion = 2&nbsp;mmol/L .

Generally, the sodium, chloride, potassium and lactate come from NaCl ([[sodium chloride]]), NaC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ([[sodium lactate]]), CaCl<sub>2</sub> ([[calcium chloride]]), and KCl ([[potassium chloride]]).

Hartmann's IV infusion is given via an intravenous line (drip) and can be administered at various rates depending on the cause for necessity.

==Contraindications==
Hartmann's solution may be relatively contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, as one of the isomers of lactate is [[Gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]].<ref>D. J. B. Thomas AND K. G. M. M. Alberti, 'Hyperglycaemic effects of Hartmann's solution during surgery in patients with maturity onset diabetes', British Journal of Anaesthesia, (1978, 50, 185) - http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/50/2/185</ref>
Hartmann solution should not be given if the patient has congestive heart
failure (constant wheezing, shortness of breath), ischaemic stroke (have had a stroke), liver disease as a consequence of alcoholism, or severe reduction in kidney function.

==Side effects==
Some swelling of the hands, ankles and feet may be experienced due to fluid retention in the body.  In rare circumstances, this may also involve the lungs, which may cause some breathing difficulty.  Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, drowsiness or confusion. Inflammation at the site of injection,
or swelling of the veins near the site of injection is also possible.
