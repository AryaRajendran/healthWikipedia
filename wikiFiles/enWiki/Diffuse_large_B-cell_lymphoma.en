'''Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma''' (DLBCL) is a [[cancer]] of [[B cell]]s, a type of [[white blood cell]] responsible for producing [[antibody|antibodies]]. It is the most common type of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] among adults,<ref name="Blood1997">{{Cite pmid|9166827}}</ref> with an annual incidence of 7-8 cases per 100,000 people per year.<ref name="Morton2006">{{Cite pmid|16150940}}</ref><ref name="Smith2011">{{Cite pmid|22045184}}</ref> This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals, with a median age at diagnosis around 70 years of age,<ref name="Smith2011" /> though it can also occur in children and young adults in rare cases.<ref name="Smith2010">{{Cite pmid|19958356}}</ref> DLBCL is an aggressive tumour which can arise in virtually any part of the body,<ref name="Kumar2009">{{cite book|author1=Vinay Kumar|author2=Abul K.

The causes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not well understood. Usually DLBCL arises from normal B cells, but it can also represent a transformation of other types of lymphoma or leukaemia. An underlying [[immunodeficiency]], such as [[AIDS]], is a significant risk factor.<ref name="WHO2008">{{cite book |ref=harv |title=WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues |editor1-last=Swerdlow |editor1-first=S.H. |editor2-last=Campo|editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Jaffe |editor3-first=E.S.|editor4-last=Pileri |editor4-first=S.A. |year=2008|publisher=IARC |location=Lyon |isbn=978-92-832-2431-0 |page=233}}</ref>  Infection with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] has also been found to contribute to the development of some subgroups of DLBCL.{{sfn|Swerdlow|Campo|Jaffe|Pileri|2008|p=243}}

[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of DLBCL is made by removing a portion of the tumour through a [[biopsy]], and then examining this tissue using a microscope. Usually an experienced [[Hematopathology|hematopathologist]] makes this diagnosis.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Goldman|first1=Lee|last2=Schafer|first2=Andrew I.|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|edition=24|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4377-1604-7|page=1222|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-1604-7..00191-3&isbn=978-1-4377-1604-7}}</ref> Several subtypes of DLBCL have been identified, each having a different clinical presentation and prognosis. However the usual treatment for each of these is [[chemotherapy]], often in combination with an antibody targeted at the tumour cells.{{sfn|Goldman|Schafer|2012|p=1225}} Through these treatments, more than half of patients with DLBCL can be cured,<ref name="Akyurek2011">{{Cite pmid|22213394}}</ref> and overall survival for older adults at five years is around 58%.<ref name="Feugier2005">{{Cite pmid|15867204}}</ref>

==Classification==
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma encompasses a biologically and clinically diverse set of diseases,<ref name="Alizadeh2000">{{cite pmid|10676951}}</ref> many of which cannot be separated from one another by well-defined and widely accepted criteria. However the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classification system{{sfn|Swerdlow|Campo|Jaffe|Pileri|2008|pp=233–237}} does define more than a dozen subtypes, each of which can be differentiated based on the location of the tumour, the presence of other cells within the tumour (such as [[T cell]]s), and whether the patient has certain other illnesses related to DLBCL. One of these well-defined groupings of particular note is "[[Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma|primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma]]", which arises within the thymus or mediastinal lymph nodes.{{sfn|Swerdlow|Campo|Jaffe|Pileri|2008|pp=250–251}}

In some cases, a tumour may share many features with both DLBCL and [[Burkitt lymphoma]]. In these situations, the tumour is classified as simply “B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma”. A similar situation can arise between DLBCL and [[Hodgkin’s lymphoma]]; the tumour is then classified as “B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma”.

When a case of DLBCL does not conform to any of the well-defined subtypes, and is also not considered unclassifiable, then it is classified as “diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified” (DLBCL, NOS). The majority of DLBCL cases fall into this category. Much research has been devoted to separating this still-heterogeneous group; such distinctions are usually made along lines of [[Morphology (biology)|cellular morphology]], [[gene expression]], and [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] properties.

===Morphology===
Within cellular morphology three variants are most commonly seen: centroblastic, immunoblastic, and anaplastic. Most cases of DLBCL are centroblastic, having the appearance of medium-to-large-sized [[lymphocyte]]s with scanty [[cytoplasm]]. Oval or round [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] containing fine [[chromatin]] are prominently visible, having two to four [[nucleoli]] within each nucleus. Sometimes the tumour may be monomorphic, composed almost entirely of centroblasts. However most cases are polymorphic, with a mixture of centroblastic and immunoblastic cells.{{sfn|Swerdlow|Campo|Jaffe|Pileri|2008|p=234}}

Immunoblasts have significant [[basophilic]] cytoplasm and a central nucleolus. A tumour can be classified as immunoblastic if greater than 90% of its cells are immunoblasts.{{sfn|Swerdlow|Campo|Jaffe|Pileri|2008|p=234}} This distinction can be problematic, however, because hematopathologists reviewing the microscope slides may often disagree on whether a collection of cells is best characterized as centroblasts or immunoblasts.<ref name="Harris1994">{{cite pmid|8068936}}</ref> Such disagreement indicates poor [[inter-rater reliability]].

The third morphologic variant, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]], consists of tumour cells which appear very differently from their normal B cell counterparts. The cells are generally very large with a round, oval, or polygonal shape and [[Pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]] nuclei, and may resemble [[Hodgkin's lymphoma#Pathology|Hodgkin cells]] or [[Reed–Sternberg cell|Reed-Sternberg cells]].

===Gene Expression===
[[Gene expression profiling]] studies have also attempted to distinguish heterogeneous groups of DLBCL from each other. These studies examine thousands of genes simultaneously using a [[DNA microarray]], looking for patterns which may help in grouping cases of DLBCL. Many studies now suggest that cases of DLBCL, NOS can be separated into two groups on the basis of their gene expression profiles; these groups are known as germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC).<ref name="Alizadeh2000" /><ref name="Shipp2002">{{cite pmid|11786909}}</ref><ref name="Rosenwald2002">{{cite pmid|12075054}}</ref><ref name="Wright2003">{{cite pmid|12900505}}</ref> Tumour cells in the [[Germinal center B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma|germinal centre B-cell-like]] subgroup resemble normal B cells in the [[Germinal center|germinal centre]] closely, and are generally associated with a favourable prognosis.<ref name="Gutierrez-Garcia2011">{{cite pmid|21441466}}</ref><ref name="Lenz2008">{{cite pmid|19038878}}</ref> Activated B-cell-like tumour cells are associated with a poorer prognosis,<ref name="Lenz2008" /> and derive their name from studies which show the continuous activation of certain pathways normally activated when B cells interact with an [[antigen]]. The [[NF-κB]] pathway, which is normally involved in transforming B cells into [[plasma cells]], is an important example of one such pathway.<ref name="Lenz2010">{{cite pmid|20393178}}</ref>

Another notable finding of recent gene expression studies is the importance of the cells and microscopic structures interspersed between the malignant B cells within the DLBCL tumour, an area commonly known as the tumour [[microenvironment]]. The presence of gene expression signatures commonly associated with [[macrophage]]s, T cells, and remodelling of the [[extracellular matrix]] seems to be associated with an improved prognosis and better overall survival.<ref name="Lenz2008" /><ref name="Linderoth2008">{{cite pmid|18419622}}</ref> Alternatively, expression of genes coding for [[Angiogenesis|pro-angiogenic]] factors is correlated with poorer survival.<ref name="Lenz2008" />

===Immunohistochemistry===
With the apparent success of gene expression profiling in separating biologically distinct cases of DLBCL, NOS, some researchers examined whether a similar distinction could be made using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), a widely used method for characterizing tissue samples. This technique uses highly specific antibody-based stains to detect proteins on a microscope slide, and since microarrays are not widely available for routine clinical use, IHC is a desirable alternative.<ref name="deJong2009">{{cite pmid|18794197}}</ref><ref name="Choi2009">{{cite pmid|19706817}}</ref> Many of these studies focused on stains against the products of prognostically significant genes which had been implicated in DLBCL gene expression studies. Examples of such genes include BCL2, BCL6, MUM1, LMO2, MYC, and p21. Several algorithms for separating DLBCL cases by IHC arose out of this research, categorizing tissue samples into groups most commonly known as GCB and non-GCB.<ref name="Choi2009" /><ref name="Colomo2003">{{cite pmid|12393466}}</ref><ref name="Hans2004">{{cite pmid|14504078}}</ref><ref name="Muris2006">{{cite pmid|16400625}}</ref> The correlation between these GCB/non-GCB immunohistochemical groupings and the GCB/ABC groupings used in gene expression profiling studies is uncertain,<ref name="Gutierrez-Garcia2011" /><ref name="Hans2004" /> as is their prognostic value.<ref name="Gutierrez-Garcia2011" /> This uncertainty may arise in part due to poor inter-rater reliability in performing common immunohistochemical stains.<ref name="deJong2009" />

==Treatment==
Standard treatment is [[CHOP-R]],<ref name="cornelllymphoma">http://cornell-lymphoma.com/tag/dlbcl/</ref> also referred to as "R-CHOP", an improved form of [[CHOP]] with the addition of [[rituximab]] (Rituxan),<ref name="pmid17105812">{{cite journal |author=Sehn LH |title=The revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI) is a better predictor of outcome than the standard IPI for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP |journal=Blood |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=1857–61 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17105812|doi=10.1182/blood-2006-08-038257 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17105812|author-separator=, |author2=Berry B |author3=Chhanabhai M |display-authors=3 |last4=Fitzgerald |first4=C.|last5=Gill |first5=K. |last6=Hoskins |first6=P. |last7=Klasa |first7=R. |last8=Savage |first8=K.

Farber, MD, PhD; and Randy C. Axelrod, MD |title=The Clinical and Economic Value of Rituximab for the Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies |journal=Contemporary Oncology |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=2011|url=http://www.onclive.com/publications/contemporary-oncology/2011/spring-2011/the-clinical-and-economic-value-of-rituximab-for-the-treatment-of-hematologic-malignancies}}</ref>  [[Chemotherapy]] is most often administered intravenously and is most effective when it is administered multiple times over a period of months (e.g. every 3 weeks, over 6 to 8 cycles).  For someone who will be receiving chemotherapy it is suggested they have a PICC ([[Peripherally inserted central catheter]]) in their arm near the elbow, and the catheter will extend through one of the large veins to within centimeters of the heart.  [[Radiation]] is another common treatment and is most effective if done prior to the chemotherapy, or as the last treatment after chemotherapy has been completed.

==Prognosis==
The germinal-center subtype has the best prognosis,<ref name="Turgeon"/> with 66.6% of treated patients surviving more than five years.<ref name="asco">http://abstract.asco.org/AbstView_114_99225.html</ref>

For children with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, most studies have found 5-year survival rates ranging from about 70% to more than 90%.<ref name="cancer.org">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/Non-HodgkinLymphomainChildren/OverviewGuide/non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-overview-survival-rates</ref>
