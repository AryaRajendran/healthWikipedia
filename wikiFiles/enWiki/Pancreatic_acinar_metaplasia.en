[[Image:Pancreatic acinar metaplasia - high mag.jpg|right|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a [[stomach|gastro]]-[[esophagus|esophageal]] junction with pancreatic acinar metaplasia.  The esophageal mucosa (stratified [[squamous epithelium]]) is seen on the right.  The gastric mucosa (simple columnar epithelium) is seen on the left. The metaplastic epithelial is at the junction (center of image) and has an intensely eosinophilic (bright pink) cytoplasm. [[H&E stain]].]]
'''Pancreatic acinar metaplasia''', abbreviated '''PAM''', is a common incidental [[histopathologic]] finding present in approximately 20-25% of patients undergoing an [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]].<ref name=pmid20012917>{{cite journal |author=Johansson J, Håkansson HO, Mellblom L, ''et al.'' |title=Pancreatic acinar metaplasia in the distal oesophagus and the gastric cardia: prevalence, predictors and relation to GORD |journal=J.

==Significance==
Studies are mixed on whether it is associated with pathology and [[symptoms]].<ref name=pmid8944044/> There is some [[epidemiological]] evidence to suggest is associated with [[gastroesophageal reflux]] and [[Helicobacter]] [[gastritis]].<ref name=pmid20012917/>  

There is no evidence to suggest it is pre-neoplastic, like [[Barrett's esophagus]].

==Etiology==
A slight increased [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] with age suggests, it is an acquired lesion,<ref name=pmid20012917/> as may be seen in a true [[metaplasia]].

==Histopathology==
The histopathologic features of pancreatic acinar metaplasia are: (1)
the presence of cell clusters that resembles a many-lobed "berry" (an [[acinus]]), with (2) cells that are histomorphologically identical to the glands of the [[exocrine pancreas]].
