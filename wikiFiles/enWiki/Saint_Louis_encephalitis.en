'''Saint Louis encephalitis''' is a disease caused by the [[Culex]] [[mosquito]] borne '''Saint Louis encephalitis virus'''. Saint Louis encephalitis virus is related to [[Japanese encephalitis virus]] and is a member of the [[Flaviviridae]] subgroup. This disease mainly affects the [[USA|United States]]. Occasional cases have been reported from [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].

== History ==

The name of the virus goes back to 1933 when within five weeks in autumn an encephalitis epidemic of explosive proportions broke out in the vicinity of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and the neighboring [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]].<ref>Washington Post Magazine, October 8, 1933</ref>
Over 1,000 cases were reported to the local health departments and the newly constituted [[National Institute of Health]] of the [[USA]] was appealed to for epidemiological and investigative expertise.
The previously unknown virus that caused the epidemic was isolated by the NIH team first in monkeys and then in white mice.<ref>Edward A. Beeman: ''Charles Armstrong, M.D.: A Biography''; 2007; p. 305; [http://history.nih.gov/01Docs/historical/documents/ArmstrongBiography.pdf also online here (PDF)].</ref>

== Life cycle ==

[[Mosquito]]es, from the genus ''[[Culex]]'', become infected by feeding on [[bird]]s infected with the Saint Louis encephalitis virus. Infected mosquitoes then transmit the Saint Louis encephalitis virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. The Saint Louis encephalitis virus grows both in the infected mosquito and the infected bird, but does not make either one sick. Only infected mosquitoes can transmit [[Saint Louis encephalitis virus]]. Once a [[human]] has been infected with the virus it is not transmissible from that individual to other humans.

== Presentation ==

The majority of infections result in mild illness, including [[fever]] and [[headache]]. When infection is more severe the person may experience headache, high fever, neck stiffness, [[stupor]], disorientation, [[coma]], tremors, occasional convulsions and spastic [[paralysis]]. Fatality ranges from {{j|3–30%}}. Aged people are more likely to have a fatal infection.

== Epidemiology ==

[[Image:St louis encephalitis map.PNG|thumb|450px|Human incidence of Saint Louis encephalitis in the United States, 1964-1998.]]

In the [[United States]] an average of 128 cases of Saint Louis encephalitis are recorded annually. In temperate areas of the United States, Saint Louis encephalitis cases occur primarily in the late summer or early fall. In the southern United States where the climate is milder Saint Louis encephalitis can occur year round.

== Treatment ==

There are no [[vaccines]] or any other treatments specifically for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, although one study showed that early use of interferon-alpha2b may decrease the severity of complications.<ref>Rahal JJ, Anderson J, Rosenberg C, Reagan T, Thompson LL. Effect of interferon-alpha2b therapy on St. Louis viral meningoencephalitis: clinical and laboratory results of a pilot study. J Infect Dis. 2004;15;190(6):1084-7.</ref>

== Genetics ==

Five evolutionary genetic studies of SLE virus have been published of which four<ref>Kramer LD, Presser SB, Hardy JL, Jackson AO.

''Journal of General Virology'' 84:429-440. {{doi|10.1099/vir.0.18660-0}}.</ref><ref name=May2008JGV>May FJ, Li L, Zhang S, Guzman H, Beasley DW, Tesh RB, Higgs S, Raj P, Bueno R Jr, Randle Y, Chandler L, Barrett AD. (2008) Genetic variation of St. Louis encephalitis virus. ''Journal of General Virology'' 89(8):1901-1910. {{doi|10.1099/vir.0.2008/000190-0}}.</ref> focused on [[phylogeny]], [[genetic variation]], and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] dynamics by sequencing the [[Envelope (biology)|''envelope'' protein]] gene and parts of other genes.

A recent evolutionary study<ref>Baillie GJ, Kolokotronis SO, Waltari E, Maffei JG, Kramer LD, Perkins SL. (2008) Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of St. Louis encephalitis virus genomes. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' 47(2):717-728. {{doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2008.02.015}}.</ref> based on 23 new full [[open reading frame]] sequences (near-complete [[genomes]]) found that the [[North America]]n strains belonged to a single [[clade]]. Strains were isolated at different points in time (from 1933 to 2001) which allowed for the estimation of divergence times of SLE virus clades and the overall evolutionary rate. Furthermore, this study found an increase in the [[effective population size]] of the SLE virus around the end of the 19th century that corresponds to the split of the latest North American clade, suggesting a northwards colonization of SLE virus in the [[Americas]]. Scans for natural selection showed that most [[codons]] of the SLE virus [[Open reading frame|ORF]] were evolving [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutrally]] or under [[Negative selection (natural selection)|negative selection]]. Positive selection was statistically detected only at one single codon coding for [[aminoacids]] belonging to the hypothesized [[Glycosylation#N-linked_glycosylation|''N''-linked]] [[glycosylation]] site of the [[Envelope (biology)|''envelope'' protein]]. Nevertheless, the latter can be due to selection [[In vitro|''in vitro'']] (laboratory) rather than [[In vivo|''in vivo'']] (host). In an independent study<ref name=May2008JGV/> 14 out of 106 examined ''envelope'' gene sequences were found not to contain a specific codon at position 156 coding for this glycosylation site ([[Aminoacid|Ser→Phe/Tyr]]).

Another study estimated the evolutionary rate to be {{j|4.1 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup> substitutions/site/year}} (95% confidence {{j|internal 2.5-5.7 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup> substitutions/site/year}}).<ref name=Auguste2009>Auguste AJ, Pybus OG, Carrington CV (2009). Evolution and dispersal of St. Louis encephalitis virus in the Americas. Infect Genet Evol 9(4):709-715.</ref> The virus seems to have evolved in northern [[Mexico]] and then spread northwards with migrating birds.
