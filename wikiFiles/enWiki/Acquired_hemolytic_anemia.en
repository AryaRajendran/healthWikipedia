'''Acquired hemolytic anemia''' can be divided into immune and non-immune mediated forms of [[hemolytic anemia]].

==Immune==
'''Immune mediated hemolytic anemia''' (direct [[Coombs test]] is positive)
*[[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
**[[Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
***Idiopathic
***[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)
***[[Evans' syndrome]] (antiplatelet antibodies and hemolytic antibodies)
**[[Cold agglutinin disease|Cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
***[[Idiopathic cold hemagglutinin syndrome]]
***[[Infectious mononucleosis]] and mycoplasma (atypical) pneumonia
***[[Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria]] (rare)
*[[Alloimmune]] hemolytic anemia
**[[Hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (HDN)
***[[Rh disease]] (Rh D)
***[[ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn]]
***[[Anti-Kell hemolytic disease of the newborn]]
***[[Rhesus c hemolytic disease of the newborn]]
***[[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-RhE)|Rhesus E hemolytic disease of the newborn]]
***Other [[Blood type|blood group]] incompatibility (RhC, Rhe, [[Kidd antigen system|Kidd]], [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]], MN, P and others)
**Alloimmune hemolytic [[Blood transfusion#Complications|blood transfusion]] reactions (i.e. from a non-compatible [[blood type]])
*[[Drug induced immune mediated hemolytic anemia]]
**[[Penicillin]] (high dose)
**[[Methyldopa]]

==Non-immune==
'''Non-immune mediated hemolytic anemia''' (direct [[Coombs test]] is negative)
*[[Medication|Drugs]] (i.e., some drugs and other ingested substances lead to hemolysis by direct action on RBCs, e.g. [[ribavirin]] )
*[[Toxin]]s (e.g., [[snake]] venom; plant poisons such as [[aesculin]])
*Trauma
** [[Mechanical hemolytic anemia|Mechanical]] (from [[heart valve]]s, extensive vascular surgery, microvascular disease, repeated mechanical vascular trauma)
*[[Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]] (a specific subtype with causes such as TTP, HUS, DIC and HELLP syndrome)
*Infections (Note: Direct Coombs test is sometimes positive in hemolytic anemia due to infection)
**[[Malaria]]
**[[Babesiosis]]
**[[Sepsis|Septicemia]]
*Membrane disorders
**[[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (rare acquired clonal disorder of red blood cell surface proteins)
**[[Liver disease]]

==Drug induced hemolysis==
Drug induced hemolysis has large clinical relevance. It occurs when drugs actively provoke red blood cell destruction. It can be divided in the following manner:

* [[Drug-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
* [[Drug-induced nonautoimmune hemolytic anemia]]

A total of four mechanisms are usually described, but there is some evidence that these mechanisms may overlap.<ref name="pmid10387489">{{cite journal |author=Wright MS |title=Drug-induced hemolytic anemias: increasing complications to therapeutic interventions |journal=Clin Lab Sci |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=115â€“8 |year=1999 |pmid=10387489 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
