'''''Face time''''' is an English [[idiom]] for direct personal interaction or contact between two or more people at the same time and [[location (geography)|physical location]]. Face time therefore occurs in "[[real life]]" or "meatspace" and contrasts primarily with interaction or contact which occurs over distance (e.g., via [[telephone]]) and/or electronically (e.g., via [[email]], [[instant messaging]], [[e-commerce]], or [[computer simulation]]s).

The term was originally a [[colloquialism]] but has entered the [[vernacular]] with the increasing number of people throughout the world who commonly and extensively rely on [[telecommunications]] and the [[Internet]] for personal and business communication.
