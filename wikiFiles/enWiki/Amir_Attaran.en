He has earned a B.A. from [[UC Berkeley]], a law degree from the [[University of British Columbia]], M.S. ([[Caltech]]),  LL.B. ([[University of British Columbia|UBC]]) and a D.Phil in immunology from the [[University of Oxford]].

==Advocacy==

Attaran is extensively involved with malaria advocacy.  Cooperating with the organization [[Africa Fighting Malaria]], he has argued publicly for the renewed use of [[DDT]] in sub-Saharan Africa to combat [[malaria]].  A famous 2004 article authored by Attaran in [[The Lancet]] was sharply critical of the [[WHO]] for approving ineffective malaria medicines such as [[chloroquine]] in a manner tantamount to "[[medical malpractice]]".[http://www.malaria.org/Advocacy%20The%20Beginning/WHO,%20the%20Global%20Fund,%20and%20medical%20malpractice%20in%20malaria%20treatment.pdf]  Shortly after that article and a pressure campaign led by Attaran, global policy changed very quickly to make use of [[artemisinin]] class medicines.

In 2004, Attaran wrote an opinion piece with [[Shirin Ebadi]], published in the [[New York Times]], arguing that the [[World Bank]] should incorporate democratic principles in its funding criteria, and avoid funding dictatorships.

On September 9, 2005, he wrote another opinion piece in the Times criticizing the [[United Nations]] for not adopting quantifiable metrics for its [[Millennium Development Goals]].

In February 2007, he received significant media coverage in Canada when he [[Canadian Afghan detainee issue|brought forward testimony]] by Afghan prisoners captured by Canadians and handed to the custody of the [[Afghan National Army]], who said they had later been abused by the ANA.
