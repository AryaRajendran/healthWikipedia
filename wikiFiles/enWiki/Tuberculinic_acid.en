'''Tuberculinic acid''' is a noncanonical [[nucleic acid]] initially identified as the [[poison]] of ''Tubercle bacillus'' (=''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''), the principal causative [[bacterium]] of [[tuberculosis]]. Its discovery was one of the most important landmarks in understanding tuberculosis and in [[molecular biology]]. It is regarded as the most [[toxin|toxic]] component of the [[bacillus]]. It was from this compound that [[DNA]] [[methylation]] was discovered as it was the first molecule found to contain [[5-methylcytosine]]. In addition it contains [[thymine]], [[guanine]] and [[cytosine]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Matthews AP |year=2012 |title=[http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Physiological_Chemistry.html?id=809EPAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Physiological Chemistry] |edition= |publisher= Williams & Wilkins Company/[http://www.amazon.com/Physiological-chemistry-text-book-manual-students/dp/1130145379/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1361261416&sr=1-6 RareBooksClub.com] |pages=167 |isbn=1130145379}} </ref>

==Discovery==

It was first identified by a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]] W.G. Ruppel in 1898 while trying to isolate the bacterial toxin responsible for tuberculosis. From the crushed bacilli, specifically the [[protein]] [[tuberculin]], he isolated two toxic substances, namely a [[base (chemistry)|basic compound]] which he called tuberculosamine, and a [[nucleotide]] he named tuberculisäure, later to be [[anglicization|anglicised]] to tuberculinic acid. He claimed that the tuberculosamin was bound to the nucleotide. Ruppel also found that his new compound was the most toxic component of the bacillus, 2.5 to 6 times more potent than tuberculin, the [[protein|proteinaceous]] toxin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Linton DS|year=2005|title=[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XUoLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA265&dq=ruppel+tuberculin&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-AYjUfCqOIiKrgeU04CoDQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ruppel%20tuberculin&f=false Emil Von Behring: Infectious Disease, Immunology, Serum Therapy, Volume 255]|publisher=American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia|pages=265-266|ISBN=0871692554}}</ref>

In 1925, [[Treat Baldwin Johnson]] and Coghill were detected a minor amount of a methylated [[cytosine]] derivative as a product of [[hydrolysis]] of tuberculinic acid, from [[bird|avian]] tubercle bacilli, with [[sulfuric acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Johnson TB, Coghill RD |year=1925 |title= The discovery of 5-methyl-cytosine in tuberculinic acid, the nucleic acid of the ''Tubercle bacillus'' |journal= [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01688a030 J Am Chem Soc]|volume=47 |issue=11|pages=2838–2844|doi=10.1021/ja01688a030}}</ref><ref>Grosjean H (2009).
