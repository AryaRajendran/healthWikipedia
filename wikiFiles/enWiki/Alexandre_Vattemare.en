'''Nicolas Marie Alexandre Vattemare''' (Paris, 1796–1864), also known under the stage name '''Monsieur Alexandre,''' was a French ventriloquist and philanthropist who created the first international system for the exchange of items among libraries and museums.

== Career as ventriloquist ==

Around age seven, Vattemare discovered a talent for [[ventriloquism]] and the ability to imitate sounds.<ref name="nash">{{cite web   | title =Alexandre Vattemare: A 19th Century Story | author = Suzanne Nash | publisher = Society of Dix-Neuviémistes  | year = 2004 | url=http://www.sdn.ac.uk/dixneuf/september04/nash/vattemare.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref>  He trained as a surgeon, but was refused a diploma after making cadavers seem to speak during surgical exercises.<ref name="nash"/> At age 18 he was placed in charge of some 300 to 400 [[typhus]]-afflicted Prussian prisoners of war, and in 1814, the soldiers asked that he accompany them to Berlin.<ref name="nash"/>  Facing economic problems in Berlin, he decided to earn money as a ventriloquist, performing under the stage name Monsieur Alexandre.<ref name="nash"/>  His career lasted from 1815 to 1835, during which he visited over 550 cities and performed before royalty including the Tsar of Russia and Queen Victoria.  His performances did not use a dummy, but rather involved Vattemare presenting plays in which he portrayed all the characters, involving dozens of voices.  Vattemare wrote his own comedic scripts, which he performed in French, German, and English.<ref name="nash"/>  He gained acclaim and wealth through his ventriloquism, while becoming friends with famous writers and artists including [[Goethe]], [[Lamartine]], [[Pushkin]], and [[Sir Walter Scott]].<ref name="nash"/>

== Philanthropic activities and cultural exchange system ==

After becoming famous and wealthy as a ventriloquist, Vattemare retired and spent the next 25 years as a philanthropist promoting free public libraries and the universal dissemination of culture.  During his travels, he had gathered a remarkable collection of coins, stamps, and autographs.  He had also visited museums and libraries, and had observed a high degree of duplication in collections.  He developed a new system of cultural exchanges of items between libraries and museums, which he promoted energetically for decades.  He used his fame as a ventriloquist to promote his proposed cultural exchange system.

After being rebuffed by the French legislature, he visited the United States in 1839 and 1847 to promote his system.  His proposals were better-received in the United States and Canada than they had been in France.  The city of Philadelphia gave him a signed copy of the Constitution, and he traveled to 13 states and Canada.  By 1843, he had brought "1,800 volumes, 500 coins, 250 engravings, and numerous mineralogical and natural history specimens" to France.<ref name="nash"/> In his 1847 visit, Vattemare brought with him 50 cases of French archives and coins.<ref name="nash"/>  In 1848, the [[U.S. Congress]] agreed to pay him $5,940 per year to support his project.

He inspired the founding of the [[Boston Public Library]].<ref name="bpl">[http://www.bpl.org/guides/founders.htm First Founders of the Boston Public Library, Boston Public Library]</ref> He first proposed the unification of Boston's major social libraries and a committee to investigate this idea appointed by mayor, Josiah Quincy.<ref>McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011). ''Introduction to Public Librarianship'', p. 22. Neal-Schuman.</ref>  In 1853, the system of exchange was expanded considerably with the participation of 130 libraries around the world, including the Boston Public Library.  He created the [[American Library]] of Paris, which in 1860 contained 14,000 volumes from the early United States.  Vattemare donated several cases of objects to the fledgling [[Smithsonian Institution]], which set up a system of cultural exchange inspired by Vattemare's.<ref name="nash"/>

Although Vattemare's exchange system ran out of money and collapsed after Vattemare's death, the international book exchanges organized by Vattemare had accomplished the exchange of thousands of volumes.<ref name="Tilliette">{{cite web   | title =International Document Exchanges and the Collection of Foreign Official Publications of the Bibliothèque administrative de la Ville de Paris: a Historian's Treasure Trove | author = Pierre-Alain Tilliette | publisher = International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions  | date = August 1998 | url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla64/151-133e.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref>  Vattemare is credited with inspiring the expansion of the library system in the United States, and his exchange system is regarded as a forerunner of later cultural exchange systems, including [[UNESCO]].  Books and other documents exchanged through Vattemare's system can still be found in libraries throughout the world, particularly Boston and Paris.  Those collections include many rare and valuable publications of great interest to modern historians.<ref name="Tilliette"/>
