'''Photodermatitis''', sometimes referred to as '''sun poisoning''' or '''photoallergy''', is a form of [[allergic contact dermatitis]] in which the [[allergen]] must be activated by light to sensitize the allergic response, and to cause a rash or other systemic effects on subsequent exposure. The second and subsequent exposures produce photoallergic skin conditions which are often [[eczema]]tous.

==Signs and symptoms==
Photodermatitis may result in swelling, a burning sensation, a red itchy [[rash]] sometimes resembling small [[blisters]], and peeling of the skin. [[Nausea]] may also occur. There may also be blotches where the itching may persist for long periods of time. In these areas an unsightly orange to brown tint may form, usually near or on the face.

==Causes==
Many medications and conditions can cause sun sensitivity, including:
* [[Psoralen]]s, [[coal tar]]s, photo-active dyes ([[eosin]], [[acridine orange]])
* [[Musk ambrette]], [[methylcoumarin]], [[lemon oil]] (may be present in fragrances)
* [[4-Aminobenzoic acid|PABA]] (found in sunscreens)
* [[Salicylanilide]] (found in industrial cleaners)
* [[St John's Wort]], used to treat [[clinical depression]]
* [[Hexachlorophene]] (found in some â„ž antibacterial soaps)
* Contact with sap from [[Giant Hogweed]]. [[Common Rue]] (Ruta graveolins) is another phototoxic plant commonly found in gardens
* [[Tetracycline antibiotics]] (e.g., [[tetracycline]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]])
* [[Benzoyl peroxide]]
* [[Retinoid]]s (e.g., [[isotretinoin]])
* [[NSAID]]s (e.g., [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen sodium]])
* [[Quinolone|Fluoroquinolone antibiotic]]: [[Sparfloxacin]] in 2% of cases
* [[Amiodarone]], used to treat [[atrial fibrillation]]
* [[Pellagra]]
Photodermatitis can also be caused by plants. This is called [[phytophotodermatitis]].

==Prevention==
Prevention includes avoiding exposure to the sun and wearing sun block on the affected area.

*Cover up: wear long sleeves, [[slacks]], and a wide-brimmed hat whenever harsh exposure is probable
*Avoid chemicals that may trigger a reaction
*Wear [[sunscreen]]<ref>[http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070927033635/http://www.aad.org/public/Publications/pamphlets/SunandSkin.htm Archived AAD - The Sun and Your Skin], "Allergic Reactions" section</ref><ref>[http://www.aad.org/media-resources/stats-and-facts/prevention-and-care/sunscreens AAD - Sunscreens]</ref> at least factor 30 with a high UVA protection level
*Wear [[gloves]] and/or remain indoors after handling fruits or plants which increase sensitivity to light
