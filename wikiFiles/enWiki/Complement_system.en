{{about|an aspect of the immune system||Complement system}}
The '''complement system''' helps or “complements” the ability of antibodies and [[phagocytic]] cells to clear [[pathogens]] from an organism. It is part of the [[immune system]] called the [[innate immune system]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27100|title=The complement system and innate immunity|last=Janeway|first=CA Jr|coauthors=Travers P, Walport M, et al|year=2001|work=Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease|publisher=Garland Science|accessdate=25 February 2013|location=New York}}</ref> that is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the [[adaptive immune system]].  

The complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, generally synthesized by the [[liver]], and normally circulating as inactive precursors ([[pro-proteins]]). When stimulated by one of several triggers, [[proteases]] in the system cleave specific proteins to release [[cytokines]] and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end-result of this activation cascade is massive [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] of the response and [[activation]] of the cell-killing [[membrane attack complex]]. Over 25 proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system, including [[blood plasma|serum]] proteins, [[Serous membrane|serosal]] [[proteins]], and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 5% of the [[serum globulins|globulin]] fraction of blood serum.

Three [[Metabolic pathway|biochemical pathway]]s activate the complement system: the [[classical complement pathway]], the [[alternative complement pathway]], and the [[lectin pathway]].<ref name=Abbas_2010>{{cite book | author =  Abbas AK, Lichtman AH, Pillai S | title = Cellular and Molecular Immunology. | edition = 6th | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2010 | isbn =  978-1-4160-3123-9 }}</ref>

==History==
In the late 19th century, [[Hans Ernst August Buchner]] found that blood [[serum (blood)|serum]] contained a "factor" or "principle" capable of killing [[bacteria]]. In 1896, [[Jules Bordet]], a young Belgian scientist in Paris at the Pasteur Institute, demonstrated that this principle had two components: one that maintained this effect after being heated, and one that lost this effect after being heated. The heat-stable component was responsible for the immunity against specific microorganisms, whereas the heat-sensitive (heat-labile) component was responsible for the non-specific antimicrobial activity conferred by all normal serum. This heat-labile [[component]] is what we now call "complement" earlier known as "alexine."
The term "complement" was introduced by [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1890s, as part of his larger theory of the immune system. According to this theory, the immune system consists of cells that have specific receptors on their surface to recognize [[antigens]]. Upon immunisation with an [[antigen]], more of these receptors are formed, and they are then shed from the cells to circulate in the blood. These [[Immune receptor|receptor]]s, which we now call "antibodies," were called by Ehrlich "amboceptors" to emphasise their bifunctional binding capacity: They recognise and bind to a specific antigen, but they also recognise and bind to the heat-labile antimicrobial component of fresh serum. Ehrlich, therefore, named this heat-labile component "complement," because it is something in the blood that "complements" the cells of the immune system.  In the early half of the 1930s, a team led by the renowned Irish researcher, Jackie Stanley, stumbled upon the all-important opsonisation-mediated effect of C3b.  Building off Ehrlich's work, Stanley's team proved the role of complement in both the innate as well as the cell-mediated immune response.

Ehrlich believed that each antigen-specific amboceptor has its own specific complement, whereas Bordet believed that there is only one type of complement. In the early 20th century, this controversy was resolved when it became understood that complement can act in combination with specific antibodies, or on its own in a non-specific way.

==Functions of complement==
[[Image:complement death.PNG|thumb|200px|right| [[Complement membrane attack complex|Membrane attack complex]] causing cell lysis.]]
The following are the basic functions of complement:
# '''Opsonization''' - enhancing phagocytosis of antigens
# '''Chemotaxis''' - attracting macrophages and neutrophils
# '''Cell Lysis''' - rupturing membranes of foreign cells
# '''Clumping of antigen-bearing agents'''

==Overview==

The proteins and glycoproteins that constitute the complement system are synthesized by the liver hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the [[protease]] [[C3-convertase]]. 
The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen:antibody complexes for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component [[C3 (complement)|C3]], creating C3a and C3b, and causing a cascade of further cleavage and activation events.  C3b binds to the surface of pathogens, leading to greater internalization by [[phagocyte|phagocytic cells]] by [[opsonization]]. [[C5a]] is an important [[chemokine|chemotactic protein]], helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important [[cytokine]] (adipokine) named [[Acylation stimulating protein|ASP]] and is usually rapidly cleaved by [[carboxypeptidase B]].  Both C3a and C5a have [[anaphylatoxin]] activity, directly triggering [[degranulation]] of [[mast cell]]s as well as increasing vascular permeability and [[smooth muscle]] contraction. C5b initiates the [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack pathway]], which results in the '''[[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]]''' (MAC), consisting of C5b, [[Complement component 6|C6]], [[Complement component 7|C7]], [[C8 complex|C8]], and polymeric [[Complement component 9|C9]].<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Goldman AS, Prabhakar   BS | title = The Complement System.

[[Kupffer cells]] and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens.  As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade can be found in species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome [[horseshoe crab]] species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.

!!! <small>C2 fragment nomenclature</small>
|-
!
|<small>Different assignment for the fragments C2a and C2b, as to which is larger or smaller, is found below in several current text books in immunology; however, we might safely make assignment that the former is smaller. In a literature below, in the publishing year of as early as 1994,<ref name=Janeway1994>Janeway C, Travers P (1994). ''Immunobiology : The Immune System in Health and Disease.'' London; San Francisco; New York: Current Biology Limited; Garland Pub. Inc., ISBN 0-8153-1691-7.</ref> they commented that the larger fragment of C2 should be designated C2b. In the 4th edition of their book, they say that:<ref name=janeway1999>Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Capra JD (1999). ''Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease (4th ed.),'' 635p. New York: Garland Pub, ISBN 0-8153-3217-3.</ref>

"It is also useful to be aware that the larger active fragment of C2 was originally designated C2a, and is still called that in some texts and research papers. Here, for consistency, we shall call all large fragments of complement '''b''', so the larger fragment of C2 will be designated C2b. In the classical and lectin pathways the C3 converatase enzyme is formed from membrane-bound C4b with C2b"<!-- not C2a. This citation is from Janeway's (1999) 4th edition.--> (p.&nbsp;341). 

This nomenclature is used in another literature:<ref name=abbas>Abbas AK, Lichtman AH (2003). ''Cellular and Molecular Immunology (5th ed.),'' 563p. Philadelphia: Saunders, ISBN 0-7216-0008-5.</ref> 

"(Note that, in older texts, the smaller fragment is often called C2b, and the larger one is called C2a for historical reason.)" (p.&nbsp;332).

The assignment is mixed in the latter literature, though.</small>

The [[classical complement pathway|classical pathway]] is triggered by activation of the C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or ''C1qr<sup>2</sup>s<sup>2</sup>''. This occurs when C1q binds to [[IgM]] or [[IgG]] complexed with [[antigen]]s. A single IgM can initiate the pathway, while multiple IgGs are needed. This also occurs when [[C1Q complex|C1q]] binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave [[Complement component 1S|C1s]] (another serine protease). The C1r<sup>2</sup>s<sup>2</sup> component now splits [[Complement component 4|C4]] and then [[Complement component 2|C2]], producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b; C3b later joins with C4b2b (the C3 convertase) to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex). The inhibition of C1r and C1s is controlled by [[C1-inhibitor]].

C3-convertase can be inhibited by [[Decay accelerating factor]] (DAF), which is bound to erythrocyte plasma membranes via a [[Glycophosphatidylinositol|GPI]] anchor.

[[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] is caused by complement breakdown of RBCs due to an inability to make GPI. Thus the RBCs are not protected by GPI anchored proteins such as DAF.

===Alternative pathway===
{{Main|Alternative complement pathway}}
The [[alternate complement pathway|alternative pathway]] is continuously activated at a low level, analogous to a car engine at idle, as a result of spontaneous [[complement component 3|C3]] hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The alternative pathway does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways.<ref name=Abbas_2010 /> C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by [[factor H]] and [[complement factor I|factor I]], as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind [[complement factor B|factor B]] to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of [[factor D]] will be cleaved into Ba and Bb.  Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase. The C3bBb complex is stabilized by binding oligomers of [[properdin|factor P]]. The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, some of which becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b. This newly bound C3b recruits more B,D and P activity and greatly amplifies the complement activation.  When complement is activated on a cell surface, the activation is limited by endogenous complement regulatory proteins, which include [[CD35]], [[CD46]], [[CD55]] and [[CD59]], depending on the cell. Pathogens, in general, don't have complement regulatory proteins (there are many exceptions, which reflect adaptation of microbial pathogens to vertebrate immune defenses).  Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self on the basis of the surface expression of complement regulatory proteins. Host cells don't accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement regulatory proteins, while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b.  Accordingly, the alternative complement pathway is one element of [[innate immunity]].

Once the alternative C3 convertase enzyme is formed on a pathogen or cell surface, it may bind covalently another C3b, to form C3bBbC3bP, the C5 convertase.  This enzyme then cleaves C5 to C5a, a potent [[anaphylatoxin]], and C5b.  The C5b then recruits and assembles C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9 molecules to assemble the [[membrane attack complex]]. This creates a hole or pore in the membrane that can kill or damage the pathogen or cell.

===Lectin pathway===
{{Main|Lectin pathway}}
The [[lectin]] pathway is homologous to the classical pathway, but with the opsonin, [[mannose-binding lectin]] (MBL), and [[ficolin]]s, instead of C1q. This pathway is activated by binding of MBL to mannose residues on the pathogen surface, which activates the MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1, and MASP-2 (very similar to C1r and C1s, respectively), which can then split C4 into C4a and C4b and C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2b then bind together to form C3-convertase, as in the classical pathway. Ficolins are homologous to MBL and function via MASP in a similar way. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in M-ficolin in humans, with effect on ligand-binding ability and serum levels.<ref>http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0050585</ref> In invertebrates without an adaptive immune system, ficolins are expanded and their binding specificities diversified to compensate for the lack of pathogen-specific recognition molecules.

==Activation of complements by antigen-associated antibody==
In the classical pathway, C1 binds with its C1q subunits to Fc fragments (made of CH2 region) of IgG or IgM, which has formed a complex with antigens. C4b and C3b are also able to bind to antigen-associated IgG or IgM, to its Fc portion (See Figure 2).<ref name=abbas/><ref name=Roitt/><ref name=murphy2008/> 

Such immunoglobulin-mediated binding of the complement may be interpreted as that the complement uses the ability of the immunoglobulin to detect and bind to non-self antigens as its guiding stick. The complement itself is able to bind non-self pathogens after detecting their [[pathogen-associated molecular patterns]] ([[PAMP]]s),<ref name=murphy2008/> however, utilizing specificity of antibody, complements are able to detect non-self enemies much more specifically. There must be mechanisms that complements bind to Ig but would not focus its function to Ig but to the antigen.

Figure 2 shows the classical and the alternative pathways with the late steps of complement activation schematically.<ref name=abbas/><ref name=Roitt/><ref name=murphy2008/> Some components have a variety of binding sites. In the classical pathway C4 binds to Ig-associated C1q and C1r<sup>2</sup>s<sup>2</sup> enzyme cleave C4 to C4b and 4a. C4b binds to C1q, antigen-associated Ig (specifically to its Fc portion), and even to the microbe surface. C3b binds to antigen-associated Ig and to the microbe surface. Ability of C3b to bind to antigen-associated Ig would work effectively against antigen-antibody immune complexes to make them soluble. In the figure, C2b refers to the larger of the C2 fragments.

==Regulation of the complement system==
The complement system has the potential to be extremely damaging to host tissues, meaning its activation must be tightly regulated. The complement system is regulated by [[complement control protein]]s, which are present at a higher concentration in the blood plasma than the complement proteins themselves. Some complement control proteins are present on the membranes of self-cells preventing them from being targeted by complement. One example is [[CD59]], also known as [[protectin]], which inhibits C9 polymerisation during the formation of the [[membrane attack complex]]. The classical pathway is inhibited by [[C1-inhibitor]], which binds to C1 to prevent its activation.

==Role in disease==
{{Main|Complement deficiency}}
It is thought that the complement system might play a role in many diseases with an immune component, such as [[Barraquer-Simons Syndrome]], [[asthma]], [[lupus erythematosus]], [[glomerulonephritis]],  various forms of [[arthritis]], [[autoimmune heart disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], inflammatory bowel disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries.<ref name="pmid 15087815 ">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00024382-200405000-00002 |author= Arumugam et al. |last2= Shiels |first2= IA |last3= Woodruff |first3= TM |last4= Granger |first4= DN |last5= Taylor |first5= SM |title= The role of the complement system in ischemia-reperfusion injury |journal= Shock |volume=21 |issue= 5 |pages=401–9 |year=2004 |pmid= 15087815 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19443638 ">{{cite journal |author=Naesens M, Li L, Ying L, Sansanwal P, Sigdel TK, Hsieh SC, Kambham N, Lerut E, Salvatierra O, Butte AJ, Sarwal MM.|title=Expression of Complement Components Differs Between Kidney Allografts from Living and Deceased Donors |journal= J.

Deficiencies of the terminal pathway predispose to both [[autoimmune disease]] and [[infection]]s (particularly [[Neisseria meningitidis]], due to the role that the [[membrane attack complex]] plays in attacking [[Gram-negative]] bacteria).

Mutations in the C1 inhibitor gene can cause [[hereditary angioedema]], an autoimmune condition resulting from reduced regulation of the complement pathway.

Mutations in the MAC components of complement, especially C8, are often implicated in recurrent Neisserial infection.

Diagnostic tools to measure complement activity include the [[total complement activity]] test.
