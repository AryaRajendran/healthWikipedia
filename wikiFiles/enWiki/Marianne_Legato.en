Legato is an expert on the sex-specific aspects of men's and women's [[health]] and is the founder and director of the [[Partnership for Gender-Specific Medicine]] at [[Columbia University]]. In 2008, she established the [[non-profit]] Foundation for Gender-Specific Medicine. She has devoted much of her research to the subject of women and [[heart disease]] and in 1992 won the American Heart Association's Blakeslee Award for writing the best book on cardiovascular disease written for the lay public.

Legato is the founder and editor of [[The Journal of Gender-Specific Medicine]] and of Gender-Medicine  and a leading advocate for the inclusion of women in [[clinical trial]]s. She is annually cited in [[New York Magazine]]'s top doctors issues. She is also the author of bestselling ''Why Men Die First: How to Lengthen Your Lifespan'', ''Eve's Rib:The New Science of Gender-Specific Medicine and How It Can Save Your Life'', ''The Female Heart'', and ''Why Men Never Remember and Women Never Forget,'' which was translated into eleven languages. She edited the medical textbook, Principles of Gender Specific Medicine, the first compilation for professional audiences of the sex-specific aspects of normal human function and disease. 

Legato has been an invited speaker at lectures and conferences throughout the United States and around the world.  She has been featured on the national ABC program [[20/20]] in a segment dealing with gender prejudice in women's health care and has made multiple appearances on local and national television and radio programs, including NBC's [[Good Morning America]], [[Good Day New York]], the Joan Hamburg Show, [[The Today Show]], [[Lifetime TV]], Iyanla Show, [[The Larry King Show]] and [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]].

==Childhood and Early Career==
Marianne J. Legato was born in 1935, in New York. She grew up accompanying her father, a [[general practitioner]], on house calls and hospital rounds, and knew by the age of three that she wanted to follow him into a career in medicine. Although he had high expectations for his daughter, her father was anxious to protect her and opposed her decision to go to medical school. She enrolled at his alma mater, New York University College of Medicine, but could not persuade him to allow her to have her independence and a career in medicine.

Legato began her career without the support of her family. She credits her success in medical school and after graduation to the mentorship of José Ferrer and M. Irené Ferrer, whom she met at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. M. Irené Ferrer even visited the dean of New York University College of Medicine to arrange for Legato to complete her education there, personally paying her tuition fees. Legato has two children, Christiana and Justin, who have grown up as part of Ferrer's extended family and knew her as "gran".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Professional career==
After graduating from medical school in 1962, Legato completed an [[internship]] and junior residency at [[Bellevue Hospital]] and a senior residency at the Presbyterian Hospital of the City of New York. From 1965 to 1968 she was a [[visiting fellow]] in [[cardiology]] at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and in 1968 she was appointed instructor in medicine, beginning an academic career at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, where she currently holds the position of Professor of Clinical Medicine. She is a Fellow of the [[American College of Physicians]] and a Diplomate of the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]].

Since 1969, Legato has been an attending physician at [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center]], and since 1973 at the Presbyterian Hospital in the City of New York. She is currently senior attending physician at St. Luke's-Roosevelt and has been a senior attending physician at the Presbyterian Hospital since 1998. She has held several teaching appointments and committee memberships at both institutions, and in 1997 founded the Partnership for Gender-Specific Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

As director of the Partnership, Legato promoted collaboration between academic medicine and the private sector to generate research on the differences between men and women. Her mission is to ensure the inclusion of women in clinical trials of relevance to the health of both sexes, to promote the study of differences in the [[biology]] of men and women and how gender affects the [[diagnosis]] and treatment of [[disease]], for the benefit of all patients. The Partnership for Gender-Specific Medicine is raising funds for the M. Irené Ferrer Professorship in Gender-Specific Medicine at Columbia University.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Recognition==
Legato has allegedly won extensive professional recognition for her work, including the Martha Lyon Slater Fellowship from 1965 to 1968 and in 1971, the J. Murray Steele Award, both from the [[New York Heart Association]]. Her research career, which defined the structure and function of the myocardial cell, was supported by a Research Career Development Award from the [[National Institutes of Health]] and by research grants from the National Heart and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. She has served on study sections to review applications for NIH grants at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. She was a charter member of the advisory board (1995–1998) to the newly created Office of Research in Women's Health of the NIH. There she was co-chair of the Task Force convened to set the research agenda on women's health for the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1992, Legato won the American Heart Association's Blakeslee Award for the best book written for the lay public on [[cardiovascular disease]] with her publication of THE FEMALE HEART: The Truth About Women and Heart Disease, published by [[Simon and Schuster]]. Her film, "Shattering the Myths: Women and Heart Disease” won a “Freddy”, a first prize in the category of Women's Health at The 1995 International Health and Medical Film Festival.

She was named an "American Health Hero" by American Health for Women in 1997 and received the Women's Medical Society of New York's annual Woman in Science Award in 1997. In the Fall of 2000, [[Ladies Home Journal]] honored Legato as a “Heroine of Women’s Health”.
