'''Bioprospecting''' is an umbrella term describing the process of discovery and commercialization of new products based in biological resources, typically in less-developed countries.  Bioprospecting often draws on  [[indigenous knowledge]] about uses  and characteristics of plants and animals.<ref>http://www.oha.org/pdf/bioprospecting/20071130/definition.doc</ref> In this way, bioprospecting includes biopiracy, the exploitative appropriation of indigenous forms of knowledge by commercial actors, as well as the search for previously unknown compounds in organisms that have never been used in traditional medicine.<ref>http://www.scq.ubc.ca/bioprospecting-a-new-western-blockbuster-after-the-gold-rush-the-gene-rush/</ref>

'''Biopiracy''' is a situation where indigenous knowledge of nature, originating with [[indigenous peoples]], is used by others for profit, without permission from and with little or no compensation or recognition to the indigenous people themselves.<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/biopiracy</ref> For example when bioprospectors draw on indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants which is later patented by medical companies without recognizing the fact that the knowledge is not new, or invented by the patenter, and depriving the indigenous community to the rights to commercial exploitation of the technology that they themselves had developed. Critics of this practice such as Greenpeace,<ref>http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/issues/GE/overview/causes/corporate/patents-and-biopiracy</ref> claim these practices contribute to inequality between developing countries rich in [[biodiversity]], and developed countries hosting companies that engage in 'biopiracy'.

==Famous cases==

===The Maya ICBG controversy===
The [[Maya ICBG bioprospecting controversy]] took place in 1999-2000, when the [[International Cooperative Biodiversity Group]] led by [[Ethnobiologist]] Dr. [[Brent Berlin]] was accused of being engaged in unethical forms of bioprospecting by several [[NGO]]s and indigenous organizations. The ICBG aimed to document the biodiversity of [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]] and the ethnobotanical knowledge of the indigenous [[Maya people]] - in order to ascertain whether there were possibilities of developing medical products based on any of the plants used by the indigenous groups.<ref name="hayden">{{cite book|author=Hayden, Cori|year=2003|title=When Nature Goes Public: The Making and Unmaking of Bioprospecting in Mexico|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=100–105}}</ref><ref name="limitations">{{cite book|author= Feinholz-Klip, Dafna|coauthor= García Barrios, Luis; Cook Lucas, Julie|editor=Wynberg, Rachel, Doris Schroeder & Roger Chennells (eds.)

</ref>

The Maya ICBG case was among the first to draw attention to the problems of distinguishing between benign forms of bioprospecting and unethical biopiracy, and to the difficulties of securing community participation and prior informed consent for would-be bioprospectors.<ref>{{cite book|author=James V. Lavery|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Case 1: Community Involvement in Biodiversity Prospecting in Mexico|title=Ethical Issues in International Biomedical Research: A Casebook|pages=21–42}}</ref>

=== The rosy periwinkle ===
The [[rosy periwinkle]] case dates from the 1950s. The rosy periwinkle, while native to [[Madagascar]], had been widely introduced into other tropical countries around the world well before the discovery of [[vincristine]]. This meant that researchers could obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The locally known medical properties of the plant were not the same as the medical properties discovered and commercially used by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. The use of the plant as a cure for [[diabetes]] was the original stimulus for research, but cures for [[cancer]] were the most important results. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant.<ref>Smithsonian Centre for Education and Museum Studies, [http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/zoofood/rosper.html A traditional brew leads to cancer cure].</ref> The [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] chemotherapeutic drug [[vinblastine]] is also derivable from the rosy periwinkle.<ref name= Karasov>{{cite journal | author=Karasov, C.| title=Who Reaps the Benefits of Biodiversity? | journal= Environmental Health Perspectives | year=2001 | volume= 109| issue= 12| pages= A582–A587 | doi = 10.2307/3454734 | pmid=11748021 | pmc=1240518 | publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 109, No. 12 | jstor=3454734}}</ref>

=== The neem tree ===

[[Image:Neemtree.jpg|thumb|right|A neem tree]]

In 1995, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and a pharmaceutical research firm received a patent on a technique to extract an antifungal agent from the [[neem]] tree (''Azadirachta indica''), which grows throughout [[India]] and [[Nepal]]; Indian villagers have long understood the tree's medicinal value. Although the patent had been granted on an extraction technique, the Indian press described it as a patent on the neem tree itself; the result was widespread public outcry, echoed throughout the developing world. Legal action by the Indian government followed, with the patent eventually being overturned in 2005.<ref>Vandana Shiva, [http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pir-ch.htm The neem tree - a case history of biopiracy]</ref><ref name="pt">{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61511|title=Know Instances of Patenting on the UES of Medicinal Plants in India|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=PIB, Ministry of Environment and Forests|accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>

Importantly, the pharmaceutical company involved in the neem case argued that as traditional Indian knowledge of the properties of the neem tree had never been published in an academic journal, such knowledge did not amount to "[[prior art]]" (prior art is the term used when previously existing knowledge bars a patent). Public knowledge and public disclosure (including oral or written descriptions) are considered prior art in most countries.

=== The Enola bean ===
The Enola bean (not a traditional medicine) is a variety of Mexican yellow bean, so called after the wife of the man who patented it in 1999.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2135/cropsci2004.0968 | author=L. Pallottinia, E. Garciab, J. Kamic, G. Barcacciaa and P. Gepts | title= The Genetic Anatomy of a Patented Yellow Bean | journal=Crop Science | date=1 May 2004| volume=44 | issue= 3| pages= 968&ndash;977 | url=http://crop.scijournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/3/968 }}</ref> The allegedly distinguishing feature of the variety is seeds of a specific shade of yellow. The patent-holder subsequently sued a large number of importers of Mexican yellow beans with the following result: "...export sales immediately dropped over 90% among importers that had been selling these beans for years, causing economic damage to more than 22,000 farmers in northern Mexico who depended on sales of this bean."<ref>Danielle Goldberg (2003), [http://www.american.edu/TED/enola-bean.htm Jack and the Enola Bean]</ref> A lawsuit was filed on behalf of the farmers, and on April 14, 2005 the US-PTO ruled in favor of the farmers. An appeal was heard on 16 January 2008, and the patent was revoked in May 2008.<ref>http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/newsroom/enolabean2008.htm</ref> An appeal to the court against the revocation was unsuccessful (Decided October 2009).

=== Basmati rice ===
	
In 2000, the US corporation [[RiceTec]] (a subsidiary of RiceTec AG of Liechtenstein) attempted to patent certain hybrids of [[basmati]] rice and semidwarf long-grain rice (see [http://www.google.com/patents?id=eiMnAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=U.S.+Patent+No.+5,663,484&hl=en&ei=un9rTrCzKMzrOZGS3OMF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C663%2C484&f=false U.S. Patent No. 5,663,484]). The Indian government intervened and several claims of the patent were invalidated. Meanwhile, the [[European Commission]] has agreed to protect basmati rice{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} under its [[Protected designation of origin|regulations]] pertaining to geographical indications.

=== Hoodia ===

[[Image:Hoodia gordonii GS431.png|thumb|right|The succulent ''Hoodia'']]

''[[Hoodia]]'', a [[succulent plant]], originates from the [[Kalahari Desert]] of [[South Africa]]. For generations it has been known to the traditionally living [[Bushmen|San]] people as an [[appetite suppressant]]. In 1996 South Africa’s [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] began working with medical companies to develop dietary supplements based on hoodia.<ref>Maharaj, VJ, Senabe, JV, and Horak, RM. 2008.

==Legal and political aspects==

=== Patent law ===
One common misunderstanding is that pharmaceutical companies [[patent]] the plants they collect.  While obtaining a patent on a naturally occurring organism as previously known or used is not possible, patents may be taken out on specific chemicals isolated or developed from plants. Often these patents are obtained with a stated and researched use of those chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Generally the existence, structure and synthesis of those compounds is not a part of the indigenous medical knowledge that led researchers to analyze the plant in the first place.  As a result, even if the indigenous medical knowledge is taken as prior art, that knowledge does not by itself make the active chemical compound "obvious," which is the standard applied under patent law.  

In the [[United States]], [[patent law]] can be used to protect "isolated and purified" compounds - even, in one instance, a new chemical element (see USP 3,156,523).  In 1873, [[Louis Pasteur]] patented a "yeast" which was "free from disease" (patent #141072).  Patents covering biological inventions have been treated similarly.  In the 1980 case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld a patent on a bacterium that had been genetically modified to consume petroleum, reasoning that U.S. law permits patents on "anything under the sun that is made by man."  The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) has observed that "a patent on a gene covers the isolated and purified gene but does not cover the gene as it occurs in nature".<ref>US Patent and Trademarks Office (2001), [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/utilexmguide.pdf Utility Examination Guidelines]</ref> 

Also possible under US law is patenting a [[cultivar]], a new variety of an existing organism. The patent on the enola bean [http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/07/mexican-yellow-bean-patent-finally-cooked.html (now revoked]) was an example of this sort of patent.  The [[intellectual property]] laws of the US also recognize [[plant breeders' rights]] under the [[Plant Variety Protection Act]], 7 U.S.C. §§ 2321-2582.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jim Chen | title= The Parable of the Seeds: Interpreting the Plant Variety Protection Act in Furtherance of Innovation Policy | journal=Notre Dame Law Review | year=2005 | volume=81 | issue= | pages= 105–166 | url=http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=784189 }}</ref>

===Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)===
{{Main|Convention on Biological Diversity}}
The CBD came into force in 1993. It secured rights to control access to genetic resources for the countries in which those resources are located. One objective of the CBD is to enable lesser-developed countries to better benefit from their resources and traditional knowledge. Under the rules of the CBD, bioprospectors are required to obtain [[informed consent]] to access such resources, and must share any benefits with the biodiversity-rich country. However, some critics believe that the CBD has failed to establish appropriate regulations to prevent biopiracy.  Others claim that the main problem is the failure of national governments to pass appropriate laws implementing the provisions of the CBD.<ref>International Chamber of Commerce: Access and benefit-sharing; protection of traditional knowledge [http://www.iccwbo.org/policy/ip/id2480/index.html]</ref> The CBD has been ratified by all countries in the world except for [[Andorra]], [[Holy See]] and [[United States]].
The 1994 [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs) 
and the 2001 [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]]
are further relevant [[international agreements]].

=== Bioprospecting contracts ===
The [[Ethics|ethical debate]] has sparked a new branch of international patent and [[international trade|trade law]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Bioprospecting contracts lay down the rules, between researchers and countries, of benefit sharing and can bring royalties to lesser-developed countries. However, the fairness of these contracts has been a subject of debate. Unethical bioprospecting contracts (as distinct from ethical ones) can be viewed as a new form of biopiracy.

An extensively discussed example of a bioprospecting contract is the agreement between [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] and [[INBio]] of [[Costa Rica]].<ref>John Eberlee (2000), [http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-5571-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html Assessing the Benefits of Bioprospecting in Latin America]</ref>

On June 14, 2011, Colombia approved a policy for the sustainable commercial use of its biodiversity resources, primarily through the development of biotechnology research. It includes plans to set up a national company for bioprospecting to link up with the commercial sector and will be backed with US$14 million in government funds over the next four years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fog|first=Lisbeth|title=Colombia to commercialise its biodiversity|work=SciDev.net|date=July 6, 2011|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/news/colombia-to-commercialise-its-biodiversity.html|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.dnp.gov.co/portalweb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=8Ybn45Qx_sE%3D&tabid=1260 "Documento

==Traditional knowledge database==

In response to concerns of biopiracy raised by research into turmeric, neem and basmati rice, the Government of India has been translating and publishing ancient manuscripts containing old remedies in electronic form, and in 2001 the [[Traditional Knowledge Digital Library]] was set up as a repository of 1200 formulations of various systems of Indian medicine, such as [[Ayurveda]], [[Unani]] and [[Siddha medicine|Siddha]].<ref name="pt">{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61511|title=Know Instances of Patenting on the UES of Medicinal Plants in India|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=PIB, Ministry of Environment and Forests}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/ Traditional Knowledge Digital Library] website.</ref> The texts are being recorded from [[Sanskrit]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]; made available to patent offices in English, German, French, Japanese and Spanish. The aim is to protect India's heritage from being exploited by foreign companies. Hundreds of [[yoga]] poses are also kept in the collection. The project has been criticized by a spokesman for the pharmaceutical industry as "a solution in search of a problem".<ref>John Lancaster (2006), [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=20&art_id=9484&sid=6178209&con_type=1&d_str=20060110 Age-old cures go online]</ref> The library has also signed agreements with leading international [[patent office]]s such as [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), [[United Kingdom Patent Office|United Kingdom Trademark & Patent Office]] (UKPTO) and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to protect [[traditional knowledge]] from biopiracy as it allows [[patent examiner]]s at International Patent Offices to access TKDL databases for patent search and examination purposes.<ref name="pt"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/04/28214947/CSIR-wing-objects-to-Avesthage.html|title=CSIR wing objects to Avesthagen patent claim|date=April 28, 2010|work=Live Mint}}</ref><ref name="in">{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61122|title=India Partners with US and UK to Protect Its Traditional Knowledge and Prevent Bio-Piracy|date=April 28, 2010|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>  The database is not available to the general public, but the articles to which it refers are (though typically in a not widely understood language such as Sanskrit).  In this way the database prevents subsequent patenting without making the information to which it refers readily available for public use.
