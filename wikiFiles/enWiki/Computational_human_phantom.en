'''Computational human phantoms''' are models of the [[human body]] used in [[computation|computerized analysis]]. Since the 1960s, the [[radiology|radiological science]] community has developed and applied these models for [[ionizing radiation]] [[dosimetry]] studies. These models have become increasingly accurate with respect to the internal structure of the human body. As computing evolved, so did the [[Imaging phantoms|phantoms]]. Graduating from phantoms based on simple [[quadratic equation]]s to [[voxel]]ized phantoms, which were based on actual [[medical imaging|medical images]] of the human body, was a major step. The newest models are based on more advanced mathematics, such as [[Non-uniform rational B-spline]] (NURBS) and [[polygon mesh]]es, which allow for [[spacetime|4-D]] phantoms where simulations can take place not only [[three-dimensional space|3-dimensional space]] but in time as well. Phantoms have been developed for a wide variety of humans, from children to adolescents to adults, male and female, as well as pregnant women. With such a variety of phantoms, many kinds of [[computer simulation|simulations]] can be run, from [[absorbed dose|dose]] received from medical imaging procedures to [[nuclear medicine]]. Over the years, the results of these simulations have created an assortment of standards that have been adopted in the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) recommendations.<ref name="Eckerman, K.F 2010">Xu, X.G.; Eckerman, K.F. Handbook of Anatomical Models for Radiation Dosimetry. Taylor & Francis, 2010. ISBN 978-1-4200-5979-3.</ref>

==Stylized (first-generation) computational phantoms==

The very first generation computational phantoms were developed for the needs to better assess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] [[absorbed dose|doses]] from internally deposited [[radioactive material]]s in workers and patients.  Until the late 1950s, the ICRP still used very simple models.<ref>ICRP. Report of Committee II on Permissible Dose for Internal Radiation International Commission on
Radiological Protection (Oxford: Pergamon Press), 1959.</ref> In these calculations, each organ of the body was assumed to be represented as a [[sphere]] with an "effective [[radius]]". The [[radionuclide]] of interest was assumed to be located at the center of the sphere and the "effective absorbed energy" was calculated for each organ. However, scientists attempted to model individual organs of the body and ultimately the entire human body in a realistic manner, the efforts of which led to stylized [[anthropomorphic]] phantoms—those resemble the [[human anatomy]].

In general, stylized computational phantom is a mathematical representation of the human body, when coupled with a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] [[radiation|radiation transport]] [[Computer simulation|computer code]], can be used to track the radiation interactions and energy deposition in the body. The feature of stylized computational phantom is finely tuned by adjusting individual parameters of the [[mathematical equations]], which describes the volume, position, and shape of individual [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. Stylized computational phantom has a long history of development through the 1960s to 1980s.

===MIRD phantom===

The MIRD phantom<ref>Report of the Task Group on Reference Man: ICRP Publication 23.</ref> was developed by developed by Fisher and Snyder at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) in 1960s with 22 [[internal organ]]s and more than 100 sub-regions.<ref>Fisher, H.L.J. and Snyder, W.S. "Variation of dose delivered by 137Cs as a function of body size from infancy to adulthood." ORNL-4007 (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory), P. 221, 1966.</ref><ref>Fisher, H.L.J. and Snyder, W.S. "Distribution of dose delivered in the body size from a source of gamma rays distributed uniformly in an organ", ORNL-4168 (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory), p. 245, 1967.</ref> It is the first anthropomorphic phantom representing a [[hermaphrodite]] adult for internal [[dosimetry]].

===Phantoms derived from MIRD===

[[File:Stylized Phantom - Various Ages.jpg|thumb|left|"Family" phantom series<ref>Kramer, R. et al. All about FAX: A female adult voXel phantom for Monte Carlo calculation in radiation protection dosimetry, Phys Med Biol, 49, 5203, 2004.</ref>]]

Based on MIRD phantom, many derivations of phantoms were developed for the following decades. The major types of phantom include: stylized "Family" phantom series developed in 1980s by Cristy and Eckerman; "ADAM and EVA" developed by GSF, Germany; CAM (Computerized Anatomical Man) phantom developed by [[NASA]] unknown by the mainstream radiation protection dosimetry community, etc.

===Limitation on stylized phantom===

Although many efforts were undertaken to diversify and extend its applications in [[radiation protection]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[medical imaging]], one cannot overcome its inborn limitation. The representation of [[internal organs]] in this mathematical phantom was crude, by capturing only the most general description of the position and [[geometry]] of each organ. With the powerful computer and [[tomography|tomographic]] imaging technologies became available in the late 1980s, the history launched a new era of [[voxel]] phantoms.

==Voxel (second-generation) phantoms==

[[File:Voxel Phantom - Visual Photographic Man (VIP-Man).jpg|thumb|VIP-Man phantom developed by RRMDG at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.<ref name="rpi.edu">Photo courtesy of Dr. George Xu, Rensselaer Polyechnic Institute http://www.rpi.edu/dept/radsafe/public_html/project.htm</ref>]]
	
The stylized phantoms provided only basic information with a large degree of error.  More accurate methods of simulating a human body were necessary to advance.  To allow further research, the computer technology had to become more powerful and more readily available.  This did not occur until the 1980s.  The real breakthrough occurred when [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) devices could generate highly accurate images of internal organs in three dimensions and in digital format.  Researchers discovered that they could take that [[diagnostic]] data and transform it into a [[voxel]] (volumetric pixel) format, essentially re-creating the human body in digital form in 3D.  Today there are over 38 human phantoms in voxel format, for many different uses.<ref>Zaidi, H. and Xu, X.G. (2007). "Computational anthropomorphic models of the human anatomy: The path to realistic Monte Carlo modeling in radiological sciences", Annu Rev Biomed Eng. 9,p. 471.</ref>

===Challenges for implementation===
	
Two major issues with development of the reference phantoms are difficulty in obtaining useful images and handling the large amount of [[data]] created from these images.  CT scans give the human body a large [[absorbed dose|dose]] of [[ionizing radiation]] – something the computational phantom was designed to circumvent in the first place.  MRI images take a long time to process.  Furthermore, most scans of a single subject cover only a small portion of the body, whereas a full scan series is needed for useful data.  Handling this data is also difficult.  While the newer computers had hard drives large enough to store the data, the memory requirements for processing the images to the desired voxel size were often too steep.<ref name="Eckerman, K.F 2010"/>

===Basic development process of a voxel phantom===
	
While there have been many voxel phantoms developed, they have all followed a similar path to completion.  First, they must obtain the raw data, from CT scans, MRI imaging, or direct imaging through photography.  Second, the components of the body must be segmented, or identified and separated from the rest. Third, the density of each component must be identified, along with the composition of each. Lastly, the data must be unified into a single 3D structure so it may be used for analysis.

===Early developments===
	
The earliest work on voxelized phantoms occurred independently at about the same time by Dr. Gibbs, of [[Vanderbilt University]], and Dr. Zankl at the [[National Research Center for Environment and Health]] (GSF) in Germany.<ref>Gibbs, S. and Pujol, J. (1982). "A Monte Carlo method for patient dosimetry from diagnostic x-ray." Dentomaxillofac Radiol. 11, p. 25.</ref><ref>Zankl, M. et al. (1988). "The construction of computer tomographic phantoms and their application in radiology and radiation protection." Radiat Environ Biophys, 27, p. 153.</ref> This occurred about 1982.  Dr. Gibb's work started with [[X-ray]] images, not CT or MRI images, for the reconstruction of a human phantom which was used for medical dose [[Computer simulation|simulations]]. M. Zankl and team did use CT imaging to create 12 phantoms, ranging from BABY to VISIBLE HUMAN.

===Recent developments===

===Statistical phantom===

A computational framework was presented, based on statistical shape modelling, for construction of race-specific organ models for internal radionuclide dosimetry and other nuclear-medicine applications. The proposed technique used to create the race-specific statistical phantom maintains anatomic realism and provides the statistical parameters for application to radionuclide dosimetry.<ref>Mofrad, F. B et al. (2010). "Statistical construction of a Japanese male liver phantom for internal radionuclide dosimetry." Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 140(2), pp 140-148. {{doi|10.1093/rpd/ncq164}}.</ref>

==Boundary representation  phantom==

[[File:BREP Phantom - Torso.gif|thumb|4-D BREP Phantom used to model a breathing human torso<ref name="rpi.edu"/>]]

[[Boundary representation]] (BREP) phantoms are computational human models that contain exterior and interior anatomical features of a human body] using boundary representation method. In the realm of [[medical physics|health and medical physics]] they are primarily used for [[ionizing radiation]] [[dosimetry]].

In the development of computational human phantoms, of particular interest is the concept of a [[Deformation (engineering)|"deformable"]] phantom whose [[geometry]] can be conveniently transformed to fit particular physical organ shapes, volumes, or body postures. Design of this type of phantom is realized by Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) method or polygonal mesh method, which are usually collectively called BREP methods. Compared to the voxel phantoms, BREP phantoms are better suited for geometry deformation and adjustment,  because a larger set of computerized operations are available, such as [[extrusion]], [[chamfering]], blending, [[Engineering drawing|drafting]], [[Shelling (topology)|shelling]] and [[tweaking]]. A major advantage of BREP phantoms is their ability to morph into an existing reference phantom or into the anatomy of a real worker or patient, which makes individual-specific dose calculation possible.<ref name="Phys Med Biol 2010">Na, YH. et al. Deformable adult human phantoms for radiation protection dosimetry: anthropometric data representing size distributions of adult worker populations and software algorithms, Phys Med Biol, 55, 3789, 2010.</ref>

===NURBS-based phantom===

Surfaces of a [[non-uniform rational B-spline]] (NURBS)-based phantom are defined by NURBS equations which are formulated by a set of control points. The shape and volume of a NURBS surface vary with the coordinates of [[control point (mathematics)|control points]]. This feature is useful in designing a time-dependent [[spacetime|4D]] human body modeling.<ref name="Phys Med Biol 2010"/>  An example is given by NCAT phantoms by Segars et al., which is used to simulate cardiac and respiratory motions with more realistic modeling of the cardiac system.

===Polygonal mesh-based phantom===

A [[polygonal mesh]] is composed of a set of [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], [[edge (geometry)|edges]], and [[face (geometry)|faces]] that specify the shape of a [[Polyhedron|polyhedral object]] in [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]]. The surfaces of the phantom are defined by a large amount of polygonal meshes, most commonly triangles. The polygonal mesh has three remarkable advantages in developing whole-body phantoms. Firstly, mesh surfaces depicting human anatomy can be conveniently obtained from real patient images or commercial human anatomy mesh models. Secondly, the polygonal mesh-based phantom has considerable flexibility in adjusting and fine-tuning its geometry, allowing the simulation of very complex anatomies. Thirdly, many commercial [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software, such as [[Rhinoceros 3D|Rhinoceros]], [[AutoCAD]], [[Visualization Toolkit]] (VTK), provide built-in functions able to rapidly convert polygonal mesh into NURBS.<ref name="Phys Med Biol 2010"/>

===Development===

[[File:Motion Capture with Chad Phantom.png|thumb|right|Real-life motion data (left) is acquired on a motion capture platform (center) and used to determine the posture of the CHAD phantom (right)<ref name="rpi.edu"/>]]

Segars was the precursor of applying NURBS to phantom design. In 2001 his [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] described the method of developing a dynamic NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom in detail. The phantom has a 4D beating heart model which was derived from 4D tagged (MRI) data. The remaining organs in the torso of the phantom were designed based on the [[Visible Human Project]] CT data set and were composed of 3D NURBS surfaces. Respiratory motion was also incorporated into this phantom.

In 2005, Xu et al. at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute used the 3D VIP-Man phantom to simulate respiratory motions by adopting the gated respiratory motion data of the NCAT phantom.<ref>Xu, X.G. and Shi, C.

In 2008, two triangular mesh-based phantoms were created, named as RPI Deformable Adult Male and Female (RPI-AM, RPI-FM).<ref>Xu, X.G, Zhang, J.Y., and Na, Y.H.

A Monte Carlo study of lung counting efficiency for female workers of different breast sizes using deformable phantoms Phys. Med. Biol. 53,  5527, 2008.</ref> The anatomic parameters of the phantoms were made consistent with two datasets: the mass and density of internal organs originated from ICRP-23 and ICRP-89, and the whole-body height and weight percentile data were obtained from the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES 1999-2002). Later on, to study the relationship between breast size and lung dosimetry, a new group of phantoms were produced by altering the breast geometry of RPI-AF.<ref name="Hegenbart,L. 2008"/>  

From 2006 to 2009, researchers at the [[University of Florida]] designed a total of twelve "hybrid" male and female phantoms, representing newborn, 1, 5, 10, 15-year old and adult male/females.<ref>Lee, C. et al. Hybrid computational phantoms of the male and female newborn patient: NURBS-based whole-body models, Phys Med Biol, 52, 3309, 2007.</ref><ref>Lee, C. et al.

"The UF family of reference hybrid phantoms for computational radiation dosimetry" Phys. Med. Biol. 55, no.2 (2010): 339–363.</ref> The phantoms are addressed as "[[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]]" because most organs and tissues were modeled by NURBS surfaces whereas the skeleton, brain and extra-thoracic airways were modeled by polygonal surfaces.<ref name="Stabin, M. 2008">Stabin, M. et al. ICRP-89 based adult and pediatric phantom series, J NUCL MED MEETING ABSTRACTS, 49, 14, 2008.</ref> Anatomic parameters of the phantoms were adjusted to match 4 reference datasets, i.e., standard [[anthropomorphism|anthropometric]] data, reference organ masses from ICRP Publication 89, reference elemental compositions provided in ICRP 89 as well as ICRU Report 46, and reference data on the alimentary tract organs given in ICRP Publications 89 and 100.

In 2008, researchers at [[Vanderbilt University]], in collaboration with researchers from [[Duke University]], developed a family of adult and pediatric phantoms by adapting the NURBS-based NCAT adult male and female phantoms.<ref name="Stabin, M. 2008"/> ICRP-89 reference body and organ values were used to adjust NURBS surfaces.

In 2009 Cassola et al.<ref>, VF. "FASH and MASH: female and male adult human phantoms based on polygon mesh surfaces: I. Development of the anatomy." Phys. Med. Biol. 55, no. 133 (2010): 133–162.</ref> at the [[Federal University of Pernambuco]], Brazil, developed a pair of polygonal mesh-based phantoms in standing posture], FASH (Female Adult meSH) and MASH (Male Adult meSH). The methodology is very similar but not entirely identical to the one implemented in the designing of RPI-AM and RPI-FM.

In 2010, based on existing RPI-AM, researchers at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] continued to create 5 more phantoms with different [[body mass index]] (BMI) ranging from 23 to 44&nbsp;kg∙m-2.<ref>A. Ding, M. Mille, P. F. Caracappa, X. G. Xu, "Impact of body size of obese patients on PET/CT dose estimates: Monte Carlo calculations using a set of BMI-adjustable phantoms," 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, July 31-August 4 (2011).</ref> These phantoms are used to study the correlation between BMI and organ doses resulting from CT and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) examinations.
	
In 2011 researchers at [[Hanyang University]], Korea, reported a polygon-surface reference Korean male phantom (PSRK-Man).<ref>Kim, CH. "A polygon-surface reference Korean male phantom (PSRK-Man) and its direct implementation in Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation" Phys. Med. Biol. 56, no.10 (2010): 3137–3161.</ref> This phantom was constructed by converting the Visible Korean Human-Man (VKH-man) into a polygonal mesh-based phantom. The height, weight, geometry of organs and tissues were adjusted to match the Reference Korean data. Without voxelization the PSRK-man could be directly implemented in [[Geant4]] [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation using a built-in function, but the [[computation]] time was 70~150 times longer than that required by High Definition Reference Korean-Man (HDRK-Man), a voxelized phantom derived also from VKH-man.

In 2012, researchers at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] developed the Computational Human for Animated Dosimetry (CHAD) phantom, structured such that its posture could be adjusted in conjunction with data obtained using a [[motion capture]] system.<ref>J.A. Vazquez. (2012). The Need and Feasibility of a Dynamic Computational Human Phantom for Radiation Dosimetry Simulation Using Motion Capture Data (Master’s thesis). Troy, NY: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</ref> This phantom can be used to simulate the movement of a worker involved in an occupational of nuclear accident scenario, allowing researchers to gain an understanding of the impact of changing posture in the course of worker movement on radiation dose.
