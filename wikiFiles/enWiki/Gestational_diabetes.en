'''Gestational diabetes''' (or '''gestational diabetes mellitus''', '''GDM''') is a condition in which women without previously diagnosed [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] exhibit [[hyperglycemia|high blood glucose]] levels during [[pregnancy]] (especially during their third trimester). There is some question whether the condition is natural during pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}   Gestational diabetes is caused when the insulin receptors do not function properly. This is likely due to pregnancy related factors such as the presence of human placental lactogen that interferes with susceptible insulin receptors. This in turn causes inappropriately elevated blood sugar levels.

Gestational diabetes generally has few [[symptoms]] and it is most commonly diagnosed by [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] during pregnancy. Diagnostic tests detect inappropriately high levels of [[glucose]] in blood samples. Gestational diabetes affects 3-10% of pregnancies, depending on the population studied,<ref name="emedicine">Thomas R Moore, MD et al. Diabetes Mellitus and Pregnancy. {{eMedicine|med|2349}}. Version: Jan 27, 2005 update.</ref> so may be a natural phenomenon.

As with [[diabetes mellitus in pregnancy]] in general, babies born to mothers with untreated gestational diabetes are typically at increased risk of problems such as being [[macrosomia|large for gestational age]] (which may lead to delivery complications), [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], and [[jaundice]]. If untreated, it can also cause seizures or still birth. Gestational diabetes is a treatable condition and women who have adequate [[glycemic control|control of glucose levels]] can effectively decrease these risks.  The food plan is often the first recommended target for strategic management of GDM.

Women with unmanaged gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]] (or, very rarely, [[latent autoimmune diabetes]] or [[diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} after pregnancy, as well as having a higher incidence of [[pre-eclampsia]] and [[Caesarean section]];<ref name="ap01">{{cite journal |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/5/141/4 |author=Donovan, PJ |title=Drugs for gestational diabetes |year=2010 |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=141–4}}</ref> their offspring are prone to developing [[childhood obesity]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} with [[type 2 diabetes]] later in life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Most patients are able to manage their blood glucose levels with a modified diet and the introduction of moderate exercise, but some require [[antidiabetic drugs]], including [[insulin]].<ref name="ap01" />

Women with gestational diabetes who manage the condition with diet and exercise or with medication generally have smaller birthweight babies, leading to other problems, such as survival rate of premature and early births, particularly male babies.

==Classification==
Gestational diabetes is formally defined as "any degree of [[glucose intolerance]] with onset or first recognition during pregnancy".<ref name="definition">{{Cite pmid|    9704245|noedit}} And the rest of the issue B1–B167.</ref> This definition acknowledges the possibility that patients may have previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, or may have developed diabetes coincidentally with pregnancy. Whether symptoms subside after pregnancy is also irrelevant to the diagnosis.<ref name="ADA2004">{{Cite pmid|14693936|noedit}}</ref>
a woman is diagnosed of having gestational diabetes when the glucose intolerance continues beyond 24-28 weeks of gestation.

The White classification, named after [[Priscilla White (physician)|Priscilla White]],<ref name="PWhite">{{Cite pmid|15396063|noedit}}</ref> who pioneered in research on the effect of diabetes types on perinatal outcome, is widely used to assess maternal and fetal risk. It distinguishes between gestational diabetes (type A) and diabetes that existed prior to pregnancy (pregestational diabetes). These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risks and management.<ref name="OBSTETRICS">Gabbe S.G., Niebyl J.R., Simpson J.L. OBSTETRICS: Normal and Problem Pregnancies. Fourth edition. Churchill Livingstone, New York, 2002. ISBN 0-443-06572-1</ref>

The two subtypes of gestational diabetes (diabetes which began during pregnancy) are: 
* Type A1: abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), but normal blood glucose levels during fasting and two hours after meals; diet modification is sufficient to control glucose levels
* Type A2: abnormal OGTT compounded by abnormal glucose levels during fasting and/or after meals; additional therapy with insulin or other medications is required
The second group of [[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy|diabetes which existed prior to pregnancy]] is also split up into several subtypes.

Type B: onset at age 20 or older and duration of less than 10 years.

Type C: onset at age 10-19 or duration of 10–19 years.

Type D: onset before age 10 or duration greater than 20 years.

Type E: overt diabetes mellitus with calcified pelvic vessels.

Type F: diabetic nephropathy.

Type R: proliferative retinopathy.

Type RF: retinopathy and nephropathy.

Type H: ischemic heart disease.

Type T: prior kidney transplant.

An early age of onset or long-standing disease comes with greater risks, hence the first three subtypes.

==Risk factors==
Classical risk factors for developing gestational diabetes are:<ref name="ACHOISreview">{{Cite pmid|16751853|noedit}}</ref>
* [[Polycystic Ovary Syndrome]]
* A previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or prediabetes, [[impaired glucose tolerance]], or [[impaired fasting glycaemia]]
* A [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] revealing a first-degree relative with [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]]
* Maternal age - a woman's risk factor increases as she gets older (especially for women over 35 years of age).
* Ethnic background (those with higher risk factors include [[African-Americans]], [[Afro-Caribbeans]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Hispanics]], [[Pacific Islanders]],  and people originating from [[South Asia]])
* Being [[overweight]], [[obesity|obese]] or severely obese increases the risk by a factor 2.1, 3.6 and 8.6, respectively.<ref name="obesity">{{Cite pmid|17416786|noedit}}</ref>
* A previous pregnancy which resulted in a child with a macrosomia (high birth weight: >90th centile or >4000 g (8&nbsp;lbs 12.8 oz))
* Previous poor obstetric history

In addition to this, statistics show a double risk of GDM in [[smoking|smokers]].<ref name="smoking">{{Cite pmid|15583373|noedit}}</ref> [[Polycystic ovarian syndrome]] is also a risk factor,<ref name="ACHOISreview"/> although relevant evidence remains controversial.<ref name="controversial">{{Cite pmid|18710713|noedit}}</ref> Some studies have looked at more controversial potential risk factors, such as [[short stature]].<ref name="short">{{Cite pmid|17666468|noedit}}</ref>

About 40-60% of women with GDM have no demonstrable risk factor; for this reason many advocate to screen all women.<ref name=precis>{{cite book|title=Precis V. An Update on Obstetrics and Gynecology.| author=[[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]]|publisher=ACOG (1994)|page=170|isbn=0-915473-22-4}}</ref> Typically, women with GDM exhibit no symptoms (another reason for universal screening), but some women may demonstrate increased [[thirst]], increased [[urination]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[cystitis|bladder infection]], [[yeast infection]]s and [[blurred vision]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:insulin glucose metabolism.jpg|thumbnail|'''Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism.''' Insulin binds to its receptor (1) on the cell membrane which in turn starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include: translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the [[plasma membrane]] and influx of glucose (3), [[glycogen]] synthesis (4), [[glycolysis]] (5) and [[fatty acid]] synthesis (6).]]
The precise mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes remain unknown. The hallmark of GDM is increased [[insulin resistance]]. Pregnancy hormones and other factors are thought to interfere with the action of insulin as it binds to the [[insulin receptor]]. The interference probably occurs at the level of the [[cell signaling]] pathway behind the insulin receptor.<ref name="clinicaldiabetes">Carr DB, Gabbe S. [http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/v16n1J-F98/pg4.htm Gestational Diabetes: Detection, Management, and Implications]. Clin Diabetes 1998; 16(1): 4.</ref> Since insulin promotes the entry of glucose into most cells, insulin resistance prevents glucose from entering the cells properly. As a result, glucose remains in the bloodstream, where glucose levels rise. More insulin is needed to overcome this resistance; about 1.5-2.5 times more insulin is produced than in a normal pregnancy.<ref name="clinicaldiabetes"/>

Insulin resistance is a normal phenomenon emerging in the second trimester of pregnancy, which progresses thereafter to levels seen in non-pregnant patients with type 2 diabetes. It is thought to secure glucose supply to the growing fetus. Women with GDM have an insulin resistance they cannot compensate with increased production in the β-cells of the pancreas. [[Placenta]]l [[hormones]], and to a lesser extent increased [[fat]] deposits during pregnancy, seem to mediate insulin resistance during pregnancy. [[Cortisol]] and [[progesterone]] are the main culprits, but [[human placental lactogen]],  [[prolactin]] and [[estradiol]] contribute, too.<ref name="clinicaldiabetes"/>

It is unclear why some patients are unable to balance insulin needs and develop GDM; however, a number of explanations have been given, similar to those in type 2 diabetes: [[autoimmunity]], single gene [[mutations]], obesity, and other mechanisms.<ref name="pathophysiology">{{Cite pmid|15765129|noedit}}</ref>

Because glucose travels across the placenta (through [[Facilitated diffusion|diffusion facilitated]] by [[GLUT3]] carriers), in untreated gestational diabetes the fetus is exposed to consistently higher glucose levels. This leads to increased fetal levels of [[insulin]] (insulin itself cannot cross the placenta). The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a large body ([[macrosomia]]). After birth, the high glucose environment disappears, leaving these newborns with ongoing high insulin production and susceptibility to low blood glucose levels ([[hypoglycemia]]).<ref name="controversies">{{Cite PMID |15934273 |noedit}}</ref>

==Screening==
{{OGTT}}
A number of screening and diagnostic tests have been used to look for high levels of [[glucose]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] in defined circumstances. One method is a stepwise approach where a suspicious result on a screening test is followed by diagnostic test. Alternatively, a more involved diagnostic test can be used directly at the first antenatal visit in high-risk patients (for example in those with [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] or [[acanthosis nigricans]]).<ref name="controversies"/>

Non-challenge blood glucose tests involve measuring glucose levels in blood samples without challenging the subject with glucose solutions. A blood glucose level is determined when fasting, 2 hours after a meal, or simply at any random time. In contrast, challenge tests involve drinking a glucose solution and measuring glucose concentration thereafter in the blood; in diabetes, they tend to remain high. The glucose solution has a very sweet taste which some women find unpleasant; sometimes, therefore, artificial flavours are added. Some women may experience nausea during the test, and more so with higher glucose levels.<ref name="taste">{{Cite pmid|11165688|noedit}}</ref><ref name="notaste">{{Cite pmid|3799747|noedit}}</ref>

===Pathways===
Opinions differ about optimal screening and diagnostic measures, in part due to differences in population risks, cost-effectiveness considerations, and lack of an [[evidence based medicine|evidence base]] to support large national screening programs.<ref name="SOGCguidelines">{{Cite pmid|12417905|noedit}}</ref> The most elaborate regimen entails a random blood glucose test during a booking visit, a screening glucose challenge test around 24–28 weeks' gestation, followed by an OGTT if the tests are outside normal limits. If there is a high suspicion, a woman may be tested earlier.<ref name="ADA2004"/>

In the [[United States]], most obstetricians prefer universal screening with a screening glucose challenge test.<ref name="USquestionnaire">{{Cite pmid|15172857|noedit}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], obstetric units often rely on risk factors and a random blood glucose test.<ref name="controversies"/><ref name="UKquestionnaire">{{Cite pmid| 10229307|noedit}}</ref> The [[American Diabetes Association]] and the [[Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada]] recommend routine screening unless the patient is low risk (this means the woman must be younger than 25 years and have a [[body mass index]] less than 27, with no personal, ethnic or family risk factors)<ref name="ADA2004"/><ref name="SOGCguidelines"/> The [[Canadian Diabetes Association]] and the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommend universal screening.<ref name="CDA2003">Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee. Canadian Diabetes Association 2003 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Diabetes in Canada. ''Can J Diabetes'' 2003; '''27 (Suppl 2)''': 1–140.</ref><ref name="ACOG">{{Cite pmid|14551019|noedit}}</ref> The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] found there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening.<ref name="pmid18490689">{{Cite pmid|18490689|noedit}}</ref>

Some pregnant women and careproviders choose to forgo routine screening due to the absence of risk factors, however this is not advised due to the large proportion of women who develop gestational diabetes despite having no risk factors present and the dangers to the mother and baby if gestational diabetes remains untreated.<ref name=precis></ref> 

===Non-challenge blood glucose tests===
When a plasma glucose level is found to be higher than 126&nbsp;mg/dl (7.0&nbsp;mmol/l) after fasting, or over 200&nbsp;mg/dl (11.1&nbsp;mmol/l) on any occasion, and if this is confirmed on a subsequent day, the diagnosis of GDM is made, and no further testing is required.<ref name="ADA2004"/> These tests are typically performed at the first antenatal visit. They are patient-friendly and inexpensive, but have a lower test performance compared to the other tests, with moderate [[Sensitivity and specificity#Sensitivity|sensitivity]], low [[Sensitivity and specificity#Specificity|specificity]] and high [[false positive]] rates.<ref name="FGTreview">{{Cite pmid| 16967273|noedit}}</ref><ref name="FGT">{{Cite pmid|12798525|noedit}}</ref><ref name="fasting">{{Cite pmid|17506370|noedit}}</ref>

===Screening glucose challenge test===
The screening glucose challenge test (sometimes called the O'Sullivan test) is performed between 24–28 weeks, and can be seen as a simplified version of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). No previous fasting is required for this screening test,<ref>[http://www.ddeamc.amedd.army.mil/clinical/pathology/DPALSGTT.aspx GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST] at the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center]]. Last Modified November 25, 2009</ref> in contrast to the OGTT. The O'Sullivan test involves drinking a solution containing 50&nbsp;grams of glucose, and measuring blood levels 1 hour later.<ref name=niddk>{{cite web | author=Boyd E. Metzger, M.D., Susan A. Biastre, R.D., L.D.N., C.D.E., Beverly Gardner, R.D., L.D.N., C.D.E. | title =What I need to know about Gestational Diabetes | publisher=National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse | work =National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse | url=http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/gestational/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

If the cut-off point is set at 140&nbsp;mg/dl (7.8&nbsp;mmol/l), 80% of women with GDM will be detected.<ref name="ADA2004"/> If this threshold for further testing is lowered to 130&nbsp;mg/dl, 90% of GDM cases will be detected, but there will also be more women who will be subjected to a consequent OGTT unnecessarily.

===Oral glucose tolerance test===
{{Main|Oral glucose tolerance test}}
The OGTT<ref name="MedlineOGTT">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003466.htm Glucose tolerance test]. [[MedlinePlus]], November 8, 2006.</ref> should be done in the morning after an overnight fast of between 8 and 14 hours. During the three previous days the subject must have an unrestricted diet (containing at least 150 g [[carbohydrate]] per day) and unlimited physical activity. The subject should remain seated during the test and should not smoke throughout the test.

The test involves drinking a solution containing a certain amount of glucose, usually 75 g or 100 g, and drawing blood to measure glucose levels at the start and on set time intervals thereafter.

The diagnostic criteria from the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) have been used most often, but some centers rely on the Carpenter and Coustan criteria, which set the cutoff for normal at lower values. Compared with the NDDG criteria, the Carpenter and Coustan criteria lead to a diagnosis of gestational diabetes in 54 percent more pregnant women, with an increased cost and no compelling evidence of improved perinatal outcomes.<ref name=NCBI2>{{Cite pmid|7148898|noedit}}</ref>

The following are the values which the [[American Diabetes Association]] considers to be abnormal during the 100 g of glucose OGTT:

* Fasting blood glucose level ≥95&nbsp;mg/dl (5.33&nbsp;mmol/L)
* 1 hour blood glucose level ≥180&nbsp;mg/dl (10&nbsp;mmol/L)
* 2 hour blood glucose level ≥155&nbsp;mg/dl (8.6&nbsp;mmol/L)
* 3 hour blood glucose level ≥140&nbsp;mg/dl (7.8&nbsp;mmol/L)

An alternative test uses a 75 g glucose load and measures the blood glucose levels before and after 1 and 2 hours, using the same reference values. This test will identify fewer women who are at risk, and there is only a weak concordance (agreement rate) between this test and a 3 hour 100 g test.<ref name="comparison">{{Cite pmid| 16873295|noedit}}</ref>

The glucose values used to detect gestational diabetes were first determined by O'Sullivan and Mahan (1964) in a [[retrospective cohort study]] (using a 100&nbsp;grams of glucose OGTT) designed to detect risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. The values were set using whole blood and required two values reaching or exceeding the value to be positive.<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | title =Gestational Diabetes | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diabetes Mellitus & Pregnancy - Gestational Diabetes | url=http://www.health.am/pregnancy/gestational-diabetes/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-27 | unused_data =Carla Janzen, MD, Jeffrey S. Greenspoon, MD}}</ref> Subsequent information led to alterations in O'Sullivan's criteria. When methods for blood glucose determination changed from the use of whole blood to venous plasma samples, the criteria for GDM were also changed.

===Urinary glucose testing===
Women with GDM may have high glucose levels in their urine ([[glucosuria]]). Although [[dipstick]] testing is widely practiced, it performs poorly, and discontinuing routine dipstick testing has not been shown to cause underdiagnosis where universal screening is performed.<ref name="routine">{{Cite pmid|17465289|noedit}}</ref> Increased [[glomerular filtration rate]]s during pregnancy contribute to some 50% of women having glucose in their urine on dipstick tests at some point during their pregnancy. The sensitivity of glucosuria for GDM in the first 2 trimesters is only around 10% and the [[positive predictive value]] is around 20%.<ref name="glucosuria">{{Cite pmid|16266604|noedit}}</ref><ref name="ascorbicacid">{{Cite pmid|16856816|noedit}}</ref>

==Management==
{{main|Diabetes management}}

[[File:Gestational diabetes kit.jpg|thumb|A kit with a glucose meter and diary used by a woman with gestational diabetes.]]

The goal of treatment is to reduce the risks of GDM for mother and child. Scientific evidence is beginning to show that controlling glucose levels can result in less serious fetal complications (such as [[macrosomia]]) and increased maternal [[quality of life]]. Unfortunately, treatment of GDM is also accompanied by more infants admitted to neonatal wards and more [[induction of labour|inductions of labour]], with no proven decrease in [[cesarean section]] rates or [[perinatal mortality]].<ref name="ACHOIS">{{Cite pmid| 15951574|noedit}}</ref><ref name="Tri-Hospital">{{Cite pmid| 7631672|noedit}}</ref> These findings are still recent and controversial.<ref name="Cochrane2003">{{Cite pmid|12917965|noedit}}</ref>

A repeat OGTT should be carried out 6 weeks after delivery, to confirm the diabetes has disappeared. Afterwards, regular screening for type 2 diabetes is advised.<ref name="ACHOISreview"/>

If a [[diabetic diet]] or [[G.I. Diet]], exercise, and oral medication are inadequate to control glucose levels, insulin therapy may become necessary.

The development of macrosomia can be evaluated during pregnancy by using [[obstetric ultrasonography|sonography]].  Women who use insulin, with a history of stillbirth, or with hypertension are managed like women with overt diabetes.<ref name=precis/>

===Lifestyle===
Counselling before pregnancy (for example, about preventive [[folic acid]] supplements) and multidisciplinary management are important for good pregnancy outcomes.<ref name="diabetespregnancy">{{Cite pmid|18007138|noedit}}</ref> Most women can manage their GDM with dietary changes and exercise. Self monitoring of blood glucose levels can guide therapy. Some women will need [[antidiabetic drugs]], most commonly [[insulin]] therapy.

Any diet needs to provide sufficient calories for pregnancy, typically 2,000 - 2,500 kcal with the exclusion of simple carbohydrates.<ref name=precis/> The main goal of dietary modifications is to avoid peaks in blood sugar levels. This can be done by spreading carbohydrate intake over meals and snacks throughout the day, and using slow-release carbohydrate sources—known as the [[G.I. Diet]]. Since insulin resistance is highest in mornings, breakfast carbohydrates need to be restricted more.<ref name="ACHOISreview"/> Ingesting more fiber in foods with whole grains, or fruit and vegetables can also reduce the risk of gestational diabetes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.yahoo.net/news/s/hsn/healthtipyourdietsroleingestationaldiabetes |title=Healthy Diet During Pregnancy|accessdate=21 January 2011 }}</ref> 

Regular moderately intense physical exercise is advised, although there is no consensus on the specific structure of exercise programs for GDM.<ref name="ACHOISreview"/><ref name="exercise">{{Cite pmid|18001611|noedit}}</ref>

Self monitoring can be accomplished using a handheld capillary glucose dosage system. Compliance with these glucometer systems can be low.<ref name="Langer1994"/> Target ranges advised by the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society are as follows:<ref name="ACHOISreview"/>
* fasting capillary blood glucose levels <5.5&nbsp;mmol/L
* 1 hour postprandial capillary blood glucose levels <8.0&nbsp;mmol/L
* 2 hour postprandial blood glucose levels <6.7&nbsp;mmol/L
Regular blood samples can be used to determine [[HbA1c]] levels, which give an idea of glucose control over a longer time period.<ref name="ACHOISreview"/>

Research suggests a possible benefit of [[breastfeeding]] to reduce the risk of diabetes and related risks for both mother and child.<ref name="breastfeeding">{{Cite pmid|16192255|noedit}}</ref>

===Medication===
If monitoring reveals failing control of glucose levels with these measures, or if there is evidence of complications like excessive fetal growth, treatment with insulin might become necessary. The most common therapeutic regime involves premeal fast-acting insulin to blunt sharp glucose rises after meals.<ref name="ACHOISreview"/> Care needs to be taken to avoid low blood sugar levels ([[hypoglycemia]]) due to excessive insulin injections. Insulin therapy can be normal or very tight; more injections can result in better control but requires more effort, and there is no consensus that it has large benefits.<ref name="controversies"/><ref name="fourinjections">{{Cite pmid|    10550081|noedit}}</ref><ref name="verytight">{{Cite pmid|17636623|noedit}}</ref>

There is some evidence that certain oral glycemic agents might be safe in pregnancy, or at least, are significantly less dangerous to the developing fetus than poorly controlled diabetes.  [[Glyburide]], a second generation [[sulfonylurea]], has been shown to be an effective alternative to insulin therapy.<ref name="glyburide-review">{{Cite pmid|15167862|noedit}}</ref><ref name="glyburide-NEJM">{{Cite pmid| 11036118|noedit}}</ref> In one study, 4% of women needed supplemental insulin to reach blood sugar targets.<ref name="glyburide-NEJM"/>
[[Metformin]] has shown promising results, with its oral format being much more popular than insulin injections.<ref name="ap01" /> Treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome with metformin during pregnancy has been noted to decrease GDM levels.<ref name="metformin">{{Cite pmid|15115425|noedit}}</ref> A recent [[randomized controlled trial]] of metformin versus insulin showed that women preferred metformin tablets to insulin injections, and that metformin is safe and equally effective as insulin.<ref name="MiG">{{Cite pmid|18463376|noedit}}</ref> Severe neonatal hypoglycemia was less common in insulin-treated women, but preterm delivery was more common. Almost half of patients did not reach sufficient control with metformin alone and needed supplemental therapy with insulin; compared to those treated with insulin alone, they required less insulin, and they gained less weight.<ref name="MiG"/> With no long-term studies into children of women treated with the drug, here remains a possibility of long-term complications from metformin therapy,<ref name="ap01" /> although follow-up at the age of 18 months of children born to women with [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] and treated with metformin revealed no developmental abnormalities.<ref name="metformin-followup">{{Cite pmid|15117896|noedit}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Gestational diabetes generally resolves once the baby is born. Based on different studies, the chances of developing GDM in a second pregnancy, if you had GDM in your first pregnancy, are between 30 and 84%, depending on ethnic background. A second pregnancy within 1 year of the previous pregnancy has a high rate of recurrence.<ref name="recurrence">{{Cite pmid|17290037|noedit}}</ref>

Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus in the future. The risk is highest in women who needed insulin treatment, had [[antibody|antibodies]] associated with diabetes (such as antibodies against [[glutamate decarboxylase]], [[islet cell antibodies]] and/or [[insulinoma antigen-2]]), women with more than two previous pregnancies, and women who were obese (in order of importance).<ref name="rsikfactors">{{Cite pmid|16505245|noedit}}</ref><ref name="antibodies">{{Cite pmid|16505514|noedit}}</ref> Women requiring insulin to manage gestational diabetes have a 50% risk of developing diabetes within the next five years.<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | title =Gestational Diabetes | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diabetes Mellitus & Pregnancy - Gestational Diabetes | url=http://www.health.am/pregnancymore/diabetes-intrapartum-postpartum-management/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-28 | unused_data =Carla Janzen, MD, Jeffrey S.

Children of women with GDM have an increased risk for childhood and adult obesity and an increased risk of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes later in life.<ref name="Metabolicsyndrome">{{Cite pmid|15741354|noedit}}</ref> This risk relates to increased maternal glucose values.<ref name="imprinting">{{Cite pmid|17519427|noedit}}</ref> It is currently unclear how much genetic susceptibility and environmental factors each contribute to this risk, and if treatment of GDM can influence this outcome.<ref name="long-term">{{Cite pmid|17982340|noedit}}</ref>

There are scarce statistical data on the risk of other conditions in women with GDM; in the Jerusalem Perinatal study, 410 out of 37962 patients were reported to have GDM, and there was a tendency towards more breast and pancreatic cancer, but more research is needed to confirm this finding.<ref name="breast">{{Cite pmid|17476589|noedit}}</ref><ref name="pancreas">{{cite pmid|17705823|noedit}}</ref>

===Complications===
GDM poses a risk to mother and child. This risk is largely related to uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and its consequences. The risk increases with higher blood glucose levels.<ref name="HAPO2008">{{Cite pmid|18463375|noedit}}</ref> Treatment resulting in better control of these levels can reduce some of the risks of GDM considerably.<ref name="Langer1994">{{Cite pmid|8166187|noedit}}</ref>

The two main risks GDM imposes on the baby are growth abnormalities and chemical imbalances after birth, which may require admission to a [[neonatal intensive care unit]]. Infants born to mothers with GDM are at risk of being both [[large for gestational age]] (macrosomic)<ref name="HAPO2008"/> in unmanaged GDM, and [[small for gestational age]] and [[Intrauterine growth retardation]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Setji|first=T. L.|coauthors=Brown, A. J.; Feinglos, M. N.|title=Gestational Diabetes Mellitus|journal=Clinical Diabetes|date=1 January 2005|year=2005|month=January|volume=23|issue=1|pages=17–24|doi=10.2337/diaclin.23.1.17}}</ref> in managed GDM. Macrosomia in turn increases the risk of instrumental deliveries (e.g. [[forceps]], [[ventouse]] and [[caesarean section]]) or problems during vaginal delivery (such as [[shoulder dystocia]]). Macrosomia may affect 12% of normal women compared to 20% of patients with GDM.<ref name="controversies"/> However, the evidence for each of these complications is not equally strong; in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study for example, there was an increased risk for babies to be large but not small for gestational age in women with uncontrolled GDM.<ref name="HAPO2008"/> Research into complications for GDM is difficult because of the many confounding factors (such as obesity). Labelling a woman as having GDM may in itself increase the risk of having an unnecessary caesarean section.<ref name="Toronto">{{Cite pmid|9371855|noedit}}</ref><ref name="SantaBarbara">{{Cite pmid|9259932|noedit}}</ref>

Neonates born from women with consistently high blood sugar levels are also at an increased risk of low blood glucose ([[hypoglycemia]]), [[jaundice]], high [[red blood cell]] mass ([[polycythemia]]) and low blood calcium ([[hypocalcemia]]) and magnesium ([[hypomagnesemia]]).<ref name="impactneonate">{{Cite pmid|12144115|noedit}}</ref> Untreated GDM also interferes with maturation, causing dysmature babies prone to [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] due to incomplete lung maturation and impaired [[surfactant]] synthesis.<ref name="impactneonate"/>

Unlike pre-gestational diabetes, gestational diabetes has not been clearly shown to be an independent risk factor for [[birth defect]]s. Birth defects usually originate sometime during the [[Pregnancy#First trimester|first trimester]] (before the 13th week) of pregnancy, whereas GDM gradually develops and is least pronounced during the first and early second trimester. Studies have shown that the offspring of women with GDM are at a higher risk for congenital malformations.<ref name="teratogenicity">{{Cite pmid|17977497|noedit}}</ref><ref name="predict-malformations">{{Cite pmid|15910631|noedit}}</ref><ref name="embryonal">{{Cite pmid|15449398|noedit}}</ref> A large case-control study found that gestational diabetes was linked with a limited group of birth defects, and that this association was generally limited to women with a higher body mass index (≥ 25&nbsp;kg/m²).<ref name="pmid18674752">{{Cite pmid|18674752 |noedit}}</ref> It is difficult to make sure that this is not partially due to the inclusion of women with pre-existent type 2 diabetes who were not diagnosed before pregnancy.

Because of conflicting studies, it is unclear at the moment whether women with GDM have a higher risk of [[preeclampsia]].<ref name="hypertension">{{Cite pmid|16879782|noedit}}</ref> In the HAPO study, the risk of preeclampsia was between 13% and 37% higher, although not all possible confounding factors were corrected.<ref name="HAPO2008"/>

==Epidemiology==
Gestational diabetes affects 3-10% of pregnancies, depending on the population studied.<ref name="emedicine"/>
