'''Manganese deficiency ''' in humans results in a number of medical problems.  [[Manganese]] is a vital element of [[nutrition]] in very small quantities (adult male daily intake 2.3 milligrams).  However, in greater amounts manganese, like most metals, is [[Manganism|poisonous]] when eaten or inhaled.

==Function==
Manganese is a component of some [[enzymes]] and stimulates the development and activity of other enzymes.  Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the principal [[antioxidant]] in [[mitochondria]].  Several enzymes activated by manganese contribute to the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrates]], [[amino acids]], and [[cholesterol]].<ref>Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine. Manganese. Dietary reference intakes for vitamin A, vitamin K, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium, and zinc. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press; 2001:394-419. (National Academy Press)</ref>

A deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of [[collagen]] in wound healing.<ref>Keen CL, Zidenberg-Cherr S. Manganese. In: Ziegler EE, Filer LJ, eds. Present Knowledge in Nutrition. 7th ed. Washington D.C.: ILSI Press; 1996:334-343.</ref>

Manganese is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, nuts and whole grains.  The nutritious kernel, called [[wheat germ]], which contains the most minerals and vitamins of the grain, has been removed from most processed grains (such as [[white bread]]).  The wheat germ is often sold as [[livestock feed]].  Many common vitamin and [[mineral supplements|mineral supplement]] products fail to include manganese in their compositions.  Relatively high dietary intake of other minerals such as [[iron]], [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]] may inhibit the proper intake of manganese.<ref>Kies C. Bioavailability of manganese. In: Klimis-Tavantzis DL, ed. Manganese in health and disease. Boca Raton: CRC Press, Inc; 1994:39-58.</ref>

==Health==

Many nutritionists attribute [[joint pain]], [[inflammation]], [[arthritis]], [[bursitis]], [[dermatitis]], and many diseases including  [[osteoporosis]], [[schizophrenia]], [[diabetes]], and [[epilepsy]] to manganese deficiency.<ref>[http://www.alkenmrs.com/vitamins/manganese-mineral.html http://web.archive.org/web/20100314051848/http://www.healthylivinganswers.com/vitamins/manganese-mineral.html]</ref>
