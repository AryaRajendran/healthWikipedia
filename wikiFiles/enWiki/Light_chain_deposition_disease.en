'''Light chain deposition disease''' (LCDD) is a rare blood cell disease which is characterized by deposition of fragments of infection-fighting [[immunoglobulins]],  called [[light chain]]s,  in the body.  These light chain deposits damage organs and cause disease. The kidneys are almost always affected and this often leads to kidney failure.  About half of people with light chain deposition disease also have [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name="Kastritis">{{cite journal |author=Kastritis|title=Treatment of light chain deposition disease with bortezomib and dexamethasone |journal=Haematologica |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=300–302 |year=2009 |month=February|pmid= 19066331 |doi=10.3324/haematol.13548 |pmc=2635400}}</ref><ref name="UNC">{{cite web |url=http://www.unckidneycenter.org/kidneyhealthlibrary/lightchain.html |title=Light Chain Deposition Disease |author= [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] Kidney Center|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]]|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>  Unlike in [[AL amyloidosis]], in which light chains are laid down in characteristic [[amyloid]] deposits, in LCDD, light chains are deposited in non-amyloid granules.<ref name=Ronco/>

==Clinical manifestations==

The kidney is the organ most frequently affected.  [[Proteinuria]], loss of protein in the urine, is characteristic.  More than 90% of people with LCDD develop kidney failure, often with rapid progression of disease.<ref name="Ronco">{{cite journal |author=Ronco |title=Light Chain Deposition Disease: A Model of Glomerulosclerosis Defined at the Molecular Level |journal=J Am Soc Nephrol|volume=12|issue=7 |pages=1558–1565 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=  11423587 |doi= |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/12/7/1558.long}}</ref>

Light chains may be deposited in many other organs and may or may not result in any symptoms.  Other than the kidneys, liver and heart are the most commonly involved organs.  Deposition of light chains in the liver may lead to [[hepatomegaly]], an enlarged liver, or rarely [[portal hypertension]] or liver failure.   The heart is affected in up to 80% of patients with LCDD, and may cause [[arrythmia]]s and [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name=Ronco/>

==Prognosis==
The median time to progression to [[end stage renal disease]] is 2.7 years.  After 5 years, about 37% of patients with LCDD are alive and do not have end stage renal disease.<ref name = Kastritis/>

==Treatment==
There is no standard treatment for LCDD.  High-dose [[melphalan]] in conjunction with [[autologous stem cell transplantation]] has been used in some patients.  A regimen of [[bortezomib]] and [[dexamethasone]] has also been examined.<ref name = Kastritis/>
