'''Lithotripsy''' and the '''lithotriptor''' were developed in the early 1980s in Germany by ''[[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] Medizintechnik [[GmbH]]'' (now known as Dornier MedTech Systems GmbH)[http://www.dornier.com/americas/english_gb/aboutUs.htm], and came into widespread use with the introduction of the HM-3 [[lithotriptor]] in 1983. Within a few years, ESWL became a standard treatment of [[calculosis]].

==How it works==
The lithotriptor attempts to break up the stone with minimal collateral damage by using an externally-applied, focused, high-intensity [[acoustic pulse]]. The [[sedation|sedated]] or [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] patient lies down in the apparatus' bed, with the back supported by a water-filled coupling device placed at the level of [[kidneys]]. A [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic]] [[x-ray]] imaging system or an [[ultrasonography|ultrasound]] imaging system is used to locate the stone and aim the treatment. The first generation lithotriptor known as the HM3, has a half [[ellipsoid]]-shaped piece that opens toward the patient. The acoustic pulse is generated at the ellipsoidal [[Focus (geometry)|focal point]] that is furthest from the patient and the stone positioned at the opposite focal point receives the focused [[shock wave]]. The treatment usually starts at the equipment's lowest power level, with a long gap between pulses, in order to accustom the patient to the sensation. The length of gap between pulses is also controlled to allow cavitation bubbles to disperse minimizing tissue damage. Second and later generation machines use an acoustic lens to focus the shock wave.  This functions much like an optical lens, focusing the shock wave at the desired loci. The frequency of pulses are currently left at a slow rate for more effective comminution of the stone and to minimize morbidity while the power levels are then gradually increased, so as to break up the stone. The final power level usually depends on the patient's [[pain threshold]] and the observed success of stone breakage. If the stone is positioned near a [[bone]] (usually a [[rib]] in the case of kidney stones), this treatment may be more uncomfortable because the shock waves can cause a mild [[resonance]] in the bone which can be felt by the patient. The sensation of the treatment is likened to an elastic band twanging off the [[skin]]. Alternately the patient may be sedated during the procedure. This allows the power levels to be brought up more quickly and a much higher pulse frequency, often up to 120 shocks per minute.

The successive shock wave pressure pulses result in direct [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] forces, as well as [[cavitation]] bubbles surrounding the stone, which fragment the stones into smaller pieces that then can easily pass through the [[ureter]]s or the [[cystic duct]]. The process takes about an hour. A ureteral [[stent]] (a kind of expandable hollow tube) may be used at the discretion of the [[urologist]]. The stent allows for easier passage of the stone by relieving obstruction and through passive dilatation of the [[ureter]].

[[Extracorporeal]] lithotripsy works best with stones between 4&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm (0.4&nbsp;cm and 2.0&nbsp;cm) in diameter that are still located in the kidney. ESWL can be used to break up stones located in ureters as well, but with a lower rate of success.

The patients undergoing this procedure can, in some cases, see for themselves the progress of their treatment. If allowed to view the [[ultrasound]] or [[x-ray]] [[Computer monitor|monitor]], they may be able to see their stones change from a distinct bright point (or dark spot depending on whether the fluoro unit is set up in native or bones white) to a fuzzy cloud as the stone is disintegrated into a fine powder. 

ESWL is the least invasive of the commonplace modalities for definitive stone treatment, but provides a lower stone-free rate than other more invasive treatment methods, such as [[ureteroscopy|ureteroscopic]] manipulation with [[laser lithotripsy]] or [[percutaneous nephrolithotomy]] ([[percutaneous nephrolithotomy|PCNL]]). The passage of stone fragments may take a few days or a week and may cause [[mild pain]]. Patients may be instructed to drink as much water as practical during this time.  Patients are also advised to void through a stone screen in order to capture stone fragments for analysis.

ESWL is not without risks. The shock waves themselves, as well as cavitation bubbles formed by the agitation of the urine medium, can lead to capillary damage, renal parenchymal or subcapsular [[hemorrhage]]. This can lead to long-term consequences such as [[renal failure]] and [[hypertension]]. Overall complication rates of ESWL range from 5–20%.
