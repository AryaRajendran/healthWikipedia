'''Zolpidem''' (brand names '''Ambien''', '''Ambien CR''', '''Intermezzo''', '''Stilnox''', and '''Sublinox''') is a [[prescription drug|prescription medication]] used for the treatment of [[insomnia]] and some [[brain disorders]].

Some users have reported unexplained [[sleepwalking]]<ref>http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/an-account-of-sharing-an-ambien-with-a-girl-i-met-one-week-prior-at-a-party/</ref>{{or|date=September 2012}} while using zolpidem, as well as sleep driving,  binge eating while asleep, and performing other daily tasks while sleeping. Research by Australia's [[National Prescribing Service]] found these events occur mostly after the first dose taken, or within a few days of starting therapy.<ref>NPS Position Statement: Zolpidem and sleep-related behaviours (2008). Available at http://nps.org.au/news_and_media/media_releases/repository/zolpidem_stilnox_info_for_prescribers</ref> Rare reports of sexual [[parasomnia]] episodes related to zolpidem intake have also been reported.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Schenck | first1 = CH. | last2 = Arnulf | first2 = I. | last3 = Mahowald | first3 = MW. | title = Sleep and Sex: What Can Go Wrong?

Those under the influence of this medication may seem fully aware of their environments, though they are still asleep. This can bring about concerns for the safety of the sleepwalkers and others. These side effects may be related to the mechanism that also causes zolpidem to produce its [[hypnotic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dolder CR, Nelson MH |title=Hypnosedative-induced complex behaviours : incidence, mechanisms and management |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1021–36 |year=2008 |pmid=18998740 |doi= 10.2165/0023210-200822120-00005|url=}}</ref> It is unclear whether the drug is responsible for the behavior, but a class-action lawsuit was filed against Sanofi-Aventis in March 2006 on behalf of those who reported symptoms.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/46980 Perchance To ...

Residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive function, may persist into the day following nighttime administration.

The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in Australia in 2007  reported a man who fell 30 meters to his death from a high-rise unit balcony may have been sleepwalking under the influence of Stilnox. The coverage prompted over 40 readers to contact the newspaper with their own accounts of Stilnox-related [[Automatic behavior|automatism]], and {{As of|March 2007|lc=yes}}, the drug was under review by the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee.<ref>{{cite news |first=Heath |last=Gilmore |title=Sleeping pill safety under federal review |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/sleeping-pill-safety-under-federal-review/2007/03/10/1173478729115.html |publisher=the Sydney Morning Herald |date=2007-03-11 |accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

In February 2008, the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] attached a [[Black Box Warning]] to zolpidem, stating, that "Zolpidem may be associated with potentially dangerous complex sleep-related behaviours that may include sleep walking, sleep driving, and other bizarre behaviours.  Zolpidem is not to be taken with alcohol. Caution is needed with other CNS depressant drugs.  Limit use to four weeks maximum under close medical supervision."<ref>

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===
[[File:Stilnoct2.JPG|thumb|Ambien tablets]]
A review medical publication found long-term use of zolpidem is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[drug dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]] and [[Central nervous system|CNS]]-related adverse effects. It was recommended that zolpidem be used for short periods of time using the lowest effective dose. Zolpidem 10&nbsp;mg is effective in treating insomnia when used intermittently no fewer than three and no more than five pills per week for a period of 12 weeks.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15323600</ref> The 15-mg zolpidem dosage provided no clinical advantage over the 10-mg zolpidem dosage.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8071269</ref>

Nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g. [[cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia]]), however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkwood CK |title=Management of insomnia |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=688–96; quiz 713–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10533351 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Animal studies of the [[drug tolerance|tolerance]]-inducing properties have shown that in rodents, zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than [[benzodiazepines]], but in primates the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as that of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Petroski RE, Pomeroy JE, Das R |title=Indiplon is a high-affinity positive allosteric modulator with selectivity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors |journal=J.

Tolerance  to the effects of zolpidem can develop in some people in just a few weeks. Abrupt withdrawal may cause [[delirium]], seizures, or other severe effects, especially if used for prolonged periods and at high dosages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harter C, Piffl-Boniolo E, Rave-Schwank M |title=[Development of drug withdrawal delirium after dependence on zolpidem and zoplicone] |language=German |journal=Psychiatr Prax |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=309 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10627964 |doi= |url= |trans_title=Development of drug withdrawal delirium after dependence on zolpidem and zoplicone}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Hypnotic dependence: zolpidem and zopiclone too |journal=Prescrire Int |volume=10 |issue=51 |pages=15 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11503851 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sethi PK, Khandelwal DC |title=Zolpidem at supratherapeutic doses can cause drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal seizure |journal=J Assoc Physicians India |volume=53 |issue= |pages=139–40 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15847035 |doi= |url=http://www.japi.org/february2005/CR-139.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

When drug tolerance and physical dependence to zolpidem has developed, treatment usually entails a gradual dose reduction over a period of months to minimise withdrawal symptoms, which can resemble those seen during [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Failing that, an alternative method may be necessary for some patients, such as a switch to a [[benzodiazepine equivalent]] dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine drug, such as [[diazepam]] or [[chlordiazepoxide]], followed by a gradual reduction in dosage of the long-acting [[benzodiazepine]]. Sometimes for difficult-to-treat patients, an inpatient flumazenil rapid detoxification program can be used to detoxify from a zolpidem [[drug dependence]] or [[Substance use disorder|addiction]].<ref>{{cite journal | author =Quaglio G |coauthors=Lugoboni F, Fornasiero A, Lechi A, Gerra G, Mezzelani P | title=Dependence on zolpidem: two case reports of detoxification with flumazenil infusion | journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol | volume=20 | issue=5 | pages=285–7 | year=2005 | month=September | pmid=16096519 | doi =10.1097/01.yic.0000166404.41850.b4}}</ref>

Alcohol has [[cross tolerance]] with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive modulators such as the [[benzodiazepines]] and the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may be at increased risk of [[physical dependency]] on zolpidem. Also, alcoholics and drug abusers may be at increased risk of abusing and or becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. It should be avoided in those with a history of [[alcoholism]], [[drug misuse]], [[physical dependency]], or [[Substance dependence|psychological dependency]] on sedative-hypnotic drugs.  Zolpidem has rarely been associated with [[drug-seeking behavior]], the risk of which is amplified in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

===Overdose===
An overdose of zolpidem may cause excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, or depressed respiratory function, which may progress to coma, and possibly death. Combined with alcohol, opiates, or other [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressants, it may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zolpidem overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [[flumazenil]], which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem.<ref name="pmid2111156">{{cite journal | author = Lheureux P, Debailleul G, De Witte O, Askenasi R | title = Zolpidem intoxication mimicking narcotic overdose: response to flumazenil | journal = Human & Experimental Toxicology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–7 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2111156 | doi = 10.1177/096032719000900209 }}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Zolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700 μg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage. Analytical techniques, in general, involve gas or liquid chromatography.<ref>Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC.

==Special precautions==
===Driving===
Use of zolpidem may impair driving skills with a resultant increased risk of [[road traffic accidents]]. This adverse effect is not unique to zolpidem but also occurs with other [[hypnotic]] drugs. Caution should be exercised by motor vehicle drivers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gustavsen I, Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Engeland A, Neutel I, Mørland J |title=Road traffic accident risk related to prescriptions of the hypnotics zopiclone, zolpidem, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam |journal=Sleep Med. |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=818–22 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18226959 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2007.11.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(07)00424-8}}</ref> Studies showed that eight hours after a 10&nbsp;mg bedtime dose, 15% of women and 3% of men would have blood levels which producing impaired driving skills; for a 12.5&nbsp;mg extended-release dose, the risk increased to 33% and 25%, respectively. Consequently, the FDA recommended the dose for women be reduced for women and that prescribers should consider lower doses for men.<ref>{{cite journal |title= FDA Requires Lower Dosing of Zolpidem |journal= [[The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics]] |volume=55 |issue=1408 |page=5 |publisher= The Medical Letter |date= January 21, 2013 |url= http://secure.medicalletter.org/cannotaccess?ac=1&a=1408a&t=article&n=11758&p=tml&title=FDA%20Requires%20Lower%20Dosing%20of%20Zolpidem&i=1408 |accessdate= April 14, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title= FDA Drug Safety Communication: Risk of next-morning impairment after use of insomnia drugs; FDA requires lower recommended doses for certain drugs containing zolpidem (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, and Zolpimist) |date= January 10, 2013 |publisher= [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] |url= http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm334033.htm |accessdate= April 14, 2013 }}</ref>

===Elderly===
The elderly are more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics including zolpidem. Zolpidem causes an increased risk of falls and may induce adverse cognitive effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Antai-Otong D |title=The art of prescribing. Risks and benefits of non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the treatment of acute primary insomnia in older adults |journal=Perspect Psychiatr Care |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=196–200 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16916422 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2006.00070.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118727940/abstract}}</ref>

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of nondrug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages, and  these interventions are underused. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] (including zolpidem) sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, were found to hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother | year = 2006 | month = June | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

=== Gastroesophageal reflux disease ===

Patients suffering from [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] had reflux events measured to be significantly longer when taking zolpidem than on placebo.  (The same trend was found for reflux events in patients without GERD).  This is assumed to be due to suppression of arousal during the reflux event, which would normally result in a swallowing reflex to clear gastric acid from the esophagus.  Patients with GERD who take zolpidem thus experience significantly higher esophageal exposure to gastric acid, which increases the likelihood of developing [[esophageal cancer]].<ref name="pmid19426833">{{cite journal | author = Gagliardi GS, Shah AP, Goldstein M, Denua-Rivera S, Doghramji K, Cohen S, Dimarino AJ | title = Effect of zolpidem on the sleep arousal response to nocturnal esophageal acid exposure | journal = Clin.

===Pregnancy===
Zolpidem has been assigned to pregnancy category C by the FDA. Animal studies have revealed evidence of incomplete ossification and increased postimplantation fetal loss at doses greater than seven times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; however, teratogenicity was not observed at any dose level. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. In one case report, zolpidem was found in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is only recommended for use during pregnancy when benefits outweigh risks.

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:Zolpidem DOJ.jpg|frame|right]]
Zaleplon and Zolpidem both are agonists at the GABA A ɣ 1 subunit.
Due to its selective binding, Zolpidem has very weak [[anxiolytic]], [[myorelaxant]], and [[anticonvulsant]] properties but very strong [[hypnotic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salvà P, Costa J |title=Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem.

A [[meta-analysis]] of the randomised, controlled, [[clinical trials]] that compared benzodiazepines against [[Z-drug]]s such as zolpidem has shown few consistent differences between zolpidem and [[benzodiazepines]] in terms of [[sleep onset latency]], total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.<ref name="pmid15252823">{{cite journal | author = Dündar Y, Dodd S, Strobl J, Boland A, Dickson R, Walley T | title = Comparative efficacy of newer hypnotic drugs for the short-term management of insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human psychopharmacology | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 305–22 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15252823 | doi = 10.1002/hup.594 }}</ref>

===Drug-drug interactions===
Notable drug-drug interactions with the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem include [[chlorpromazine]], [[fluconazole]], [[imipramine]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[rifampicin]], and [[ritonavir]]. Interactions with [[carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]] can be expected based on their metabolic pathways, but have not yet been studied. There does not appear to be any interaction between zolpidem and [[cimetidine]] or [[ranitidine]].<ref>{{cite pmid|3253224|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang JS, DeVane CL |title=Pharmacokinetics and drug interactions of the sedative hypnotics |journal=Psychopharmacol Bull |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=10–29 |year=2003 |pmid=14561946 |doi= 10.1007/BF01990373|url=http://www.medworksmedia.com/psychopharmbulletin/pdf/12/010-029_PB%20W03_Wang_final.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

==Misuse==
===Recreational use===
Zolpidem has a potential for either medical misuse when the drug is continued long term without or against medical advice, or recreational use when the drug is taken to achieve a "high".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The transition from medical use of zolpidem to high-dose addiction or [[drug dependence]] can occur when used without a doctor's recommendation to continue using it, when physiological [[drug tolerance]] leads to higher doses than the usual 5&nbsp;mg or 10&nbsp;mg, when consumed through inhalation or injection, or when taken for purposes other than as a sleep aid. Misuse is more prevalent in those who have been dependent on other drugs in the past, but tolerance and [[drug dependence]] can still sometimes occur in those without a history of drug dependence. Chronic users of high doses are more likely to develop [[physical dependence]] on the drug, which may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, if abrupt withdrawal from zolpidem occurs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barrero-Hernández FJ, Ruiz-Veguilla M, López-López MI, Casado-Torres A |title=[Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Rev Neurol |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=253–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12022074 |doi= |url= |trans_title=Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem}}</ref>

As is the case with many prescription sedative/hypnotic drugs, it is sometimes used by stimulant users to "come down" after the use of stimulants such as [[amphetamines]], [[methamphetamine]], [[cocaine]], and [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] (ecstasy).<ref name="pmid14722823">{{cite journal | author = Evidente VG, Caviness JN, Adler CH | title = Case studies in movement disorders | journal = Seminars in neurology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–84 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14722823 | doi = 10.1055/s-2003-814739 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2012}}

One case history reported a woman detoxifying from a high dose of zolpidem experiencing a generalized seizure, with clinical withdrawal and dependence effects reported to be similar to the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name="pmid16950552">{{cite journal | author = Cubała WJ, Landowski J | title = Seizure following sudden zolpidem withdrawal | journal = Prog.

Nonmedical use of zolpidem is increasingly common in U.S.A, Canada, and the UK.  Recreational users report that resisting the drug's hypnotic effects can in some cases elicit vivid visuals and a body high.<ref name="test">[http://cbs11tv.com/investigators/Ambien.Sleeping.Medication.2.496959.html], additional text.</ref> Some users have reported decreased anxiety, mild [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], perceptual changes, visual distortions, and hallucinations.<ref>

Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and [[zopiclone]], are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range suggesting a high degree of excessive-use potential for [[benzodiazepines]], zolpidem and zopiclone.<ref name="pmid17417081">{{cite journal | author = Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | journal = Therapeutic drug monitoring | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17417081 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04 }}</ref>  U.S. Congressman [[Patrick J.

Zolpidem, along with the other benzodiazepine-like Z-drugs, is a Schedule IV controlled substance in the USA, according to the Controlled Substances Act, given its potential for abuse and dependence.

===Date-rape drug===
According to the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], zolpidem (Ambien, Stilnox) is quickly overtaking illegal sedatives as the most common [[Date-rape drug#Z-drugs|date-rape drug]]. Perpetrators of [[sexual assault]] have used zolpidem on unsuspecting victims.<ref name="Kintz2007">{{cite pmid|17340077}}</ref><ref name="Madea2008">{{cite doi|10.3238/arztebl.2009.0341}}</ref><!-- Please do not add examples, particularly of the recent and unverified sort. --> <!-- However, alcohol continues to be the most common date-rape drug by far.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/85513.php Alcohol Is Most Common 'Date Rape' Drug]. Medicalnewstoday.com. Retrieved on July 24, 2012.</ref> -->

==Usage==

Zolpidem is one of the most common [[GABA]]-potentiating sleeping medications prescribed in the [[Netherlands]], with a total of 582,660 prescriptions dispensed in 2008.<ref>http://www.gipdatabank.nl/</ref> 

The [[United States Air Force]] uses zolpidem as one of the hypnotics approved as "no-go pills" to help aviators and special duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness (the other hypnotics used are [[temazepam]] and [[zaleplon]] during war time). "Ground tests" are required prior to authorization issued to use the medication in an operational situation.<ref>http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFSOCI48-101.pdf</ref>



==Research==
Zolpidem may provide short-lasting but effective improvement in symptoms of [[aphasia]] present in some survivors of [[stroke]]. The mechanism for improvement in these cases remains unexplained and is the focus of current research by several groups, to explain how a drug which acts as a hypnotic-sedative in people with normal brain function, can paradoxically increase speech ability in people recovering from severe brain injury. Use of zolpidem for this application remains experimental at this time, and is not officially approved by any pharmaceutical manufacturers of zolpidem or medical regulatory agencies worldwide.<ref name="pmid16720934">{{cite journal |author=Clauss R, Nel W |title=Drug induced arousal from the permanent vegetative state |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=23–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16720934 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19620954">{{cite journal |author=Whyte J, Myers R |title=Incidence of clinically significant responses to zolpidem among patients with disorders of consciousness: a preliminary placebo controlled trial |journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=410–8|year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19620954 |doi=10.1097/PHM.0b013e3181a0e3a0 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid20097125">{{cite journal |author=Hall SD, Yamawaki N, Fisher AE, Clauss RP, Woodhall GL, Stanford IM |title=GABA(A) alpha-1 subunit mediated desynchronization of elevated low frequency oscillations alleviates specific dysfunction in stroke--a case report |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology : Official Journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=549–55 |year=2010|month=April |pmid=20097125 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.11.084 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid20486466">{{cite journal |author=Nyakale NE, Clauss RP, Nel W, Sathekge M|title=Clinical and brain SPECT scan response to zolpidem in patients after brain damage |journal=Arzneimittel-Forschung |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=177–81 |year=2010|pmid=20486466 |doi= 10.1055/s-0031-1296269|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21320843">{{cite journal |author=Machado C, Estévez M, Pérez-Nellar J, Gutiérrez J, Rodríguez R, Carballo M, Chinchilla M, Machado A, Portela L, García-Roca MC, Beltrán C |title=Autonomic, EEG, and behavioral arousal signs in a PVS case after Zolpidem intake |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences.
