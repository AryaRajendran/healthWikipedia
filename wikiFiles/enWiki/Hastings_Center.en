==Research==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2012}}
The center's projects, carried out by [[interdisciplinary]] research teams, range from "stem cell politics", to [[globalization]] and its impact on health status, to "science in the age of [[Pharmaceutical industry|big pharma]]".  Primary research areas include [[genetics]] and biotechnology, health care and health policy, ethics, science, the environment, and international science ethics.  The center strives to frame and explore issues that inform professional practice, public conversation, and social policy.

The center conducts seminar-style meetings to review developments in science and policy, frame legal and social issues, and in-depth critical reflection on fundamental principles and values. Center research scholars write and speak on a variety of topics and assist members of the press and others.

The center is funded by grant money, private donations, and subscriptions.

The Morison Library serves as a resource for center research scholars, fellows, visitors, and others.

==Reception and Influence==

The [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] has praised the Hastings Center's 1987 "Guidelines on the Termination of Life-Sustaining Treatment and the Care of the Dying" as a standard in the field of bioethics. Several court decisions, including the 1990 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'', have cited the guidelines.    
 
Hastings Center staff are frequently called upon for policy advice by committees and agencies at both the Federal and state levels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/nyregion/two-decades-as-honest-brokers-for-medicine-s-moral-issues.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=Two Decades as 'Honest Brokers' for Medicine's Moral Issues|accessdate=4 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12/17/89}}</ref>
