'''Medical Council of Canada''' '''(MCC)''' ''(French: Le Conseil médical du Canada)'' is an organization that is charged with assessing medical candidates, evaluation of [[physicians]] through exams and granting a qualification called '''[[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada]] (LMCC)''' to those who wish to practice medicine in Canada.

MCC is governed by a 51-member Executive Board of Council, who meets once a year to discuss budgets, policies and assets. The day-to-day operation is carried out by the Executive Director, currently Dr. M. Ian Bowmer.

==History==
Founded by the ''Canada Medical Act'' in 1912 through the effort of Sir [[Thomas George Roddick|Thomas Roddick]], a physician and [[Member of Parliament]], who have been pursuing a standardized licensing scheme in Canada for over 18 years.<ref>[http://www.mcc.ca/en/about/history.shtml A brief history of the Medical Council of Canada – 1912 to 2008]</ref>

Beginning April 1912, MCC gave the right to practice throughout Canada, to be admitted to the British Medical Register (BMR) to serve in the medical forces of the army and navy.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2001/fall/epilogue/ Roddick Gates Honour Canada's Foremost Physician]</ref> The practice for registering physicians into the BMR eventually ceased but those who wish to practice in the UK can register themselves with the [[General Medical Council]].

A pass standing is required on both the QE Part I and the QE Part II in order to be awarded [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada]]. LMCC is recognized by the 12 medical licensing authorities in Canada, and is one of the requirements for the issuance of a license to practice medicine in Canada.<ref>[http://www.cehpea.ca/links.html Centre for the Evaluation of Health Professionals Educated Abroad]</ref>

==Licentiate==
{{Dablink|The LMCC is not a license to practice medicine, the issuance of such being a function of the medical regulatory authorities. Instead, being an LMCC is generally a requirement to gain an [[medical license|independent practise license]] (a license to practise [[medicine]]) in [[Canada]].<ref name=LMCC>[http://www.mcc.ca/en/mcc_docs/licentiate.shtml Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC)]</ref>}}

'''Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada''', commonly abbreviated as '''LMCC''', is a [[physician]] that, according to the bylaws of MCC:

* Before 1 January 1992: Passed [[Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination]] ([[MCCQE]]) Part 1 '''and''' has completed successfully one year of [[internship (medicine)|postgraduate]] training or the MCCQE Part 2
* After 1 January 1992: Passed the MCCQE Part 1 and Part 2 <ref name="LMCC"/>

==Canadian Medical Register==
MCC also maintains the Canadian Medical Register, a list of physicians who have completed or exempted from the LMCC requirement. This is the first step for medical graduates who wish to obtain license to practice prior to applying to their own regulatory body in their home province or territory.<ref>[http://aimd.bcitp.net/index.cfm?wp=en&page=54 The Process of Becoming a Licensed Medical Doctor in BC]</ref>
