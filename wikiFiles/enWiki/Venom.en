'''Venom''' is the general term referring to any variety of [[toxin]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000115553|venom}}</ref> used by certain types of [[animal]]s that inject it into their victims by the means of a bite, sting or other sharp body feature.<ref name="urlvenom - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/venom |title=venom - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref> Unlike [[poison]], which is ingested or inhaled, venom is usually delivered directly into the [[lymphatic system]], where it acts faster.

The potency of different venoms varies; lethal venoms are often characterised by the [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>, LD50, or LD-50), expressed in terms of mass fraction (''e.g.'', milligrams of toxin per kilogram of body mass), that will kill 50% of victims of a specified type (''e.g.'', [[laboratory mice]]).

==Diversity==

===Invertebrates===
Venomous invertebrates include [[spider]]s, which use fangs - part of their [[chelicerae]] - to inject venom (see [[spider bite]]); and [[centipede]]s, which use [[Centipede#Description|forcipules]] - modified legs - to deliver venom; along with [[scorpion]]s and stinging [[insect]]s, which inject venom with a sting. In insects such as [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s the stinger is a modified egg-laying device – the [[ovipositor]]. Many [[caterpillar]]s have defensive venom glands associated with specialized bristles on the body, known as [[urtication|urticating hairs]], which can be lethal to humans (e.g., that of the ''[[Lonomia]]'' moth), although the venom's strength varies depending on the species.

Because they are tasked to defend their hives and food stores, bees synthesize and employ an acidic venom ([[apitoxin]]) to cause pain in those that they sting, whereas wasps use a chemically different venom designed to paralyze prey, so it can be stored alive in the food chambers of their young. The use of venom is much more widespread than just these examples. Other insects, such as [[Hemiptera|true bug]]s and many [[ant]]s also produce venom. At least one ant species (''Polyrhachis dives'') has been shown to use venom [[topically]] for the sterilisation of pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graystock|first=Peter|coauthors=Hughes, William O. H.|title=Disease resistance in a weaver ant, Polyrhachis dives, and the role of antibiotic-producing glands|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=2011|doi=10.1007/s00265-011-1242-y}}</ref> 

There are many other venomous invertebrates, including [[jellyfish]] and [[cone snails]]. The [[Box_jellyfish#Treatment_of_stings|box jellyfish]] is the most venomous jellyfish in the world.

===Fish===
{{main|Venomous fish}}
Venom can also be found in some [[fish]], such as the cartilaginous fishes – [[stingrays]], [[shark]]s, and [[chimaera]]s – and the [[teleost]] fishes including [[Monognathus|onejaws]], [[catfishes]], [[stonefish]]es and [[waspfish]]es, [[scorpionfish]]es and [[Pterois|lionfish]]es, [[gurnard (disambiguation)|gurnard]]s, [[rabbitfishes]], [[surgeonfish]]es, [[Scatophagidae|scats]], [[stargazers]], [[weever]], [[swarmfish]], and [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]].

===Amphibians===
There are only a few species of venomous amphibians; certain [[salamandridae|salamandrid]] [[salamanders]] can extrude sharp venom-tipped ribs.<ref>http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=1494</ref><ref>{{Cite doi | 10.2307/1443606 }}</ref>

===Snakes===
{{main|Snake venom}}
The reptiles most known to use venom are [[snake]]s, some species of which inject venom into their prey via [[tooth|fang]]s.

Snake venom is produced by glands below the eye (the [[Submandibular gland|mandibular gland]]) and delivered to the victim through tubular or channeled fangs. Snake venoms contain a variety of [[peptide]] toxins, including [[Proteases]], which [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] protein peptide bonds, [[nucleases]], which hydrolyze the [[phosphodiester]] bonds of [[DNA]], and neurotoxins, which disable signalling in the nervous system. Snakes use their venom principally for hunting, though they do not hesitate to employ it defensively. Venomous snake bites may cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, swelling, tissue necrosis, low blood pressure, convulsions, hemorrhage (varying by species of snake), respiratory paralysis, kidney failure, coma and death.

===Other reptiles===
Aside from snakes, venom is found in a few other reptiles such as the [[Mexican beaded lizard]] and [[gila monster]], and may be present in a few species of [[monitor lizard]]s.    

One such reptile that was previously thought of as being nonvenomous is the [[Komodo dragon]], ''Varanus komodoensis''. It was then demonstrated through magnetic resonance imaging that the Komodo dragon possess a mandibular gland with a major posterior compartment and five smaller anterior compartments.<ref name=fries>{{cite journal |author=Fry BG, Wroe S, Teeuwisse W, ''et al.'' |title=A central role for venom in predation by ''Varanus komodoensis'' (Komodo Dragon) and the extinct giant ''Varanus'' (''Megalania'') ''priscus'' |journal=Proc.

Due to these recent studies investigating venom glands in [[squamates]], lizards that were previously thought of as being nonvenomous are now being classified by some scientists as venomous because they possess a venom gland.  This hypothetical clade, [[Toxicofera]], includes all venomous squamates: the suborders [[Serpentes]] and [[Iguania]] and the families [[Varanidae]], [[Anguidae]], and [[Helodermatidae]].<ref name="Fry2006">{{cite journal|author = Fry, B. et al.|year= 2006 |month= February|title= Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes|journal= Nature|volume= 439|pages= 584–588|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7076/abs/nature04328.html|doi = 10.1038/nature04328|format = [http://www.naherpetology.org/pdf_files/467.pdf PDF]|pmid = 16292255|last1 = Fry|first1 = BG|last2 = Vidal|first2 = N|last3 = Norman|first3 = JA|last4 = Vonk|first4 = FJ|last5 = Scheib|first5 = H|last6 = Ramjan|first6 = SF|last7 = Kuruppu|first7 = S|last8 = Fung|first8 = K|last9 = Hedges|first9 = SB|issue = 7076|issn = 0028-0836}}</ref>

===Dinosaurs===
''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'', a genus of feathered [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] dinosaur, may have had a venomous bite. This hypothesis is still being disputed. The [[theropoda|theropod]] ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' is commonly depicted in popular culture as being venomous, but this portrayal is not considered likely by the scientific community.

===Mammals===
{{main|Venomous mammals}}
Some mammals are also venomous, including [[solenodon]]s, [[shrews]], the [[slow loris]], and the male [[platypus]].

===Therapsida===
[[Euchambersia]], a genus of [[Therocephalia]] (animals close to the evolution of mammals) is known to have had venom glands attached to its canine teeth, used to help subdue and kill its prey. The potency of its venom is unknown.

==Prophylaxis==
Physicians treat victims of a venomous bite with [[antivenom]], which is created by dosing an animal such as a [[sheep]], [[horse]], [[goat]], or [[rabbit]] with a small amount of the targeted venom.  The immune system of the subject animal responds to the dose, producing [[antibodies]] to the venom's active molecules; the antibodies can then be harvested from the animal's blood and injected into bite victims to treat envenomation. This treatment can be used effectively only a limited number of times  for a given individual, however, as a bite victim will ultimately develop antibodies to neutralize the foreign animal antigens injected into them as components of the antivenin. This is called sensitization. Even if a bite victim does not suffer a serious allergic reaction to the antivenom, his own, sensitized, immune system may destroy the antivenom before the antivenom can destroy the venom. Though most individuals never require even one treatment of anti-venom in their lifetime, let alone several, those routinely exposed to snakes or other venomous animals may become sensitized to antivenom due to previous exposure.

[[Aristolochia rugosa]] and [[Aristolochia trilobata]], or "[[Dutchman's Pipe]]", are recorded in a list of plants used worldwide and in the West Indies, South and Central America against snakebites and scorpion stings. [[Aristolochic acid]] inhibits inflammation induced by immune complexes, and nonimmunological agents (carrageenan or croton oil).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Aristolochic acid inhibits the activity of snake venom phospholipase (PLA2) by forming a 1:1 complex with the enzyme. Since phospholipase enzymes play a significant part in the cascade leading to the inflammatory and pain response, their inhibition could lead to relief of problems from scorpion envenomation.
