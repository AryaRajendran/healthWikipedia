'''Hemangioblastomas''' ('''capilliary hemangioblastomas)'''<ref>http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/newwhobt.htm</ref><ref name="WHOCBT">{{cite book |title=WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System |last=Louis |first= David N |year=1991 |publisher=IARC |isbn=92-832-2430-2 |pages=}}</ref> are tumors of the central nervous system that originate from the [[vascular system]] usually during middle-age. Sometimes these tumors occur in other sites such as the [[spinal cord]] and [[retina]].<ref name="N&NI">{{cite book |title=Neurology and Neurosurgery Illustrated |last=Lindsay |first=Kenneth W |coauthors=Ian Bone, Robin Callander, J. van Gijn |year=1991 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=United States |isbn=0-443-04345-0}}</ref> They may be associated with other diseases such as [[polycythemia]] (increased [[blood cell]] count), [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[cyst]]s and [[Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome]] (VHL syndrome). Hemangioblastomas are most commonly composed of [[stromal cell]]s in small blood vessels and usually occur in the [[cerebellum]], [[brain stem]] or [[spinal cord]]. They are classed as grade one tumors under the [[World Health Organisation]]'s classification system.<ref name="WHOCBT"/>

==Pathogenesis==
Hemangioblastomas are composed of [[endothelial cells]], [[pericytes]] and stromal cells. In [[VHL syndrome]] the [[Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor|von Hippel-Lindau protein]] (pVHL) is dysfunctional, usually due to mutation and/or gene silencing. In normal circumstances, pVHL is involved in the inhibition of [[HIF1A|hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α]] (HIF-1α) by [[ubiquitin]] mediated [[proteosome|proteosomal degradation]]. In these dysfunctional cells pVHL cannot degrade HIF-1α, causing it to accumulate. HIF-1α causes the production of [[VEGF|vascular endothelial growth factor]], [[PDGFRB|platelet derived growth factor B]], [[erythropoietin]] and [[transforming growth factor alpha]], which act to stimulate growth of cells within the tumour.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kaelin|first=William G|title=von Hippel–Lindau-associated malignancies: Mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities|journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms|year=2005|volume=2|issue=2|pages=225–231|doi=10.1016/j.ddmec.2005.04.003}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Hemangioblastoma of the conus VHL.jpg|thumb|Contrast enhanced MRI of the conus medullaris and cauda equina of patient with VHL depicts a hemangioblastoma of the conus with extension into the nerve roots.]]
The primary diagnosis is made with a [[computed tomography]] scan (CT scan). On a scan, hemangioblastoma shows as a well-defined, black region in the [[cerebellum]] with a white nodule on the wall. Sometimes multiple [[lesion]]s are present.<ref name="N&NI"/>

==Treatment==
The treatment for hemangioblastoma is [[surgical excision]] of the tumour.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-pzApsNVRo</ref> Although usually straightforward to carry out, recurrence of the tumor or more tumors at a different site develop in approximately 20% of patients.<ref name="N&NI"/> [[Gamma Knife|Gamma Knife Radiosurgery]] as well as [[Linear particle accelerator|LINAC]] have also been employed to successfully treat recurrence and control tumor growth of cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

==Prognosis==
The outcome for hemangioblastoma is very good, if surgical extraction of the tumor can be achieved; excision is possible in most cases and permanent neurologic deficit is uncommon and can be avoided altogether if the tumor is diagnosed and treated early. Persons with VHL syndrome have a bleaker prognosis than those who have sporadic tumors since those with VHL syndrome usually have more than one lesion.<ref name="WHOCBT"/>

==Complications==
Hemangioblastomas can cause [[polycythemia]].

==Epidemiology==
Hemangioblastoma are the rarest central nervous system tumours, accounting for less than 2%. Hemangioblastomas usually occur in adults, yet tumors may appear in VHL syndrome at much younger ages. Men and women are approximately at the same risk. Although they can occur in any section of the [[central nervous system]], they usually occur in either side of the [[cerebellum]], the [[brain stem]] or the [[spinal cord]].<ref name="WHOCBT"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Richard|first=S|coauthors=Campello C, Taillandier L, Parker F, Resche F.|journal=J Intern Med|year=1998|volume=243|issue=6|pages=547–553|pmid=9681857}}</ref>
