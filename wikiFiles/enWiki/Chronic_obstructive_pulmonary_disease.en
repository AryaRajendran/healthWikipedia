'''Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''' ('''COPD'''), also known as '''chronic obstructive lung disease''' ('''COLD'''), '''chronic obstructive airway disease''' ('''COAD'''), '''chronic airflow limitation''' ('''CAL''') and '''chronic obstructive respiratory disease '''('''CORD'''), is the occurrence of [[chronic bronchitis]] or [[emphysema]], a pair of commonly co-existing diseases of the lungs in which the [[airways]] narrow over time.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is COPD? |date=June 1, 2010 |work=National Heart Lung and Blood Institute |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/copd/}}</ref> This limits airflow to and from the lungs, causing [[shortness of breath]] (dyspnea).

COPD is caused by noxious particles or gas, most commonly from [[tobacco smoking]], which triggers an abnormal [[inflammatory response]] in the lung.<ref name="pmid17507545">{{cite journal |author=Rabe KF |title=Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: GOLD Executive Summary |journal=Am.

===Chronic bronchitis===
{{Main|chronic bronchitis}}
Chronic bronchitis is defined in clinical terms as a cough with [[sputum]] production on most days for 3&nbsp;months of a year, for 2 consecutive years.<ref name="ohcm">{{cite book |author=Longmore, J. M.; Murray Longmore; Wilkinson, Ian; Supraj R. Rajagopalan |title=Oxford handbook of clinical medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |pages=188–9 |isbn=0-19-852558-3 }}</ref> In the airways of the lung, the hallmark of chronic bronchitis is an increased number ([[hyperplasia]]) and increased size ([[hypertrophy]]) of the [[goblet cells]] and [[mucous glands]] of the airway. As a result, there is more mucus than usual in the airways, contributing to narrowing of the airways and causing a cough with sputum. [[Microscope|Microscopically]] there is [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltration]] of the airway walls with [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] cells. Inflammation is followed by scarring and remodeling that thickens the walls and also results in narrowing of the airways. As chronic bronchitis progresses, there is [[squamous metaplasia]] (an abnormal change in the tissue lining the inside of the airway) and [[fibrosis]] (further thickening and scarring of the airway wall). The consequence of these changes is a limitation of airflow.<ref name=kc>{{cite book |author=Kumar P, Clark M |title=Clinical Medicine |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=0-7020-2763-4 |pages=900–1 |edition=6th }}</ref>

Patients with advanced COPD that have primarily chronic bronchitis rather than emphysema were commonly referred to as "Blue Bloaters" because of the bluish color of the skin and lips ([[cyanosis]]) along with [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[Water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]] seen in them.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chung C, Delaney J, Hodgins R |chapter=Respirology |editor=Somogyi, Ron; Colman, Rebecca |title=The Toronto notes 2008: a comprehensive medical reference and review for the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Exam — Part 1 and the United States Medical Licensing Exam — Step 2 |publisher=Toronto Notes for Medical Students |location=Toronto |year=2008 |page=R9 |isbn=0-9685928-8-0 }}</ref>

===Emphysema===
{{Main|emphysema}}
Lung damage and inflammation of the air sacs ([[alveoli]]) causes emphysema. [[Emphysema]] is an enlargement of the air spaces [[distal]] to the [[terminal bronchioles]], with destruction of their walls.<ref name="ohcm"/> The destruction of air space walls reduces the [[surface area]] available for the exchange of oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]] during breathing. It also reduces the elasticity of the lung itself, which results in a loss of support for the airways that are embedded in the lung. These airways are more likely to collapse causing further limitation to airflow.
These people are also known as "Pink Puffers", due to their pink complexion.<ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pink+Puffer</ref>

There are 4 types of emphysema:
# Centriacinar / centrilobular: proximal to central parts of [[Acinus#Lungs|acini]] (air spaces closer to bronchioles) are affected
# Panacinar / panlobular: enlargement of all air spaces (from bronchioles to terminal blind alveoli). This type is associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
# Distal acinar / [[Emphysema#Paraseptal emphysema|paraseptal]]: proximal acinus normal, distal acinus affected
# Irregular: various parts of acinus involved. Associated with fibrosis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kumar V, Abbas AK |title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease |year=2009 |page=684 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

Wheeze2O.ogg   | title        = Wheezing
| description  = The sound of wheezing as heard with a stethoscope.
| format       = [[Ogg]]
}}
Essentials of diagnosis include:
* History of tobacco smoking.
* Chronic cough and sputum production (in chronic bronchitis)
* [[Dyspnea]]
* [[Rhonchi]], decreased intensity of breath sounds, and prolonged [[Exhalation|expiration]] on physical examination
* Airflow limitation on pulmonary function testing that is not fully reversible and most often progressive.

One of the most common symptoms of COPD is shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]). People with COPD commonly describe this as: "My breathing requires effort," "I feel out of breath," or "I can't get enough air in".<ref name="pmid16636091">{{cite journal |author=Mahler DA|title=Mechanisms and measurement of dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society|volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=234–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16636091 |doi=10.1513/pats.200509-103SF}}</ref> People with COPD typically first notice dyspnea during vigorous exercise when the demands on the lungs are greatest. Over the years, dyspnea tends to get gradually worse so that it can occur during milder, everyday activities such as housework. In the advanced stages of COPD, dyspnea can become so bad that it occurs during rest and is constantly present.

Other symptoms of COPD are a persistent cough, [[sputum]] or mucus production, [[wheezing]], chest tightness, and tiredness.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Are the Signs and Symptoms of COPD? |date=8 June 2012 |publisher=U.S. National Heart Lung and Blood Institute |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/copd/signs.html}}</ref><ref name=MedlinePlus>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000091|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}}</ref>

People with advanced COPD sometimes develop [[respiratory failure]]. When this happens, [[cyanosis]], a bluish discoloration of the lips caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood, can occur. An excess of carbon dioxide in the blood can cause headaches, drowsiness or twitching ([[asterixis]]). A complication of advanced COPD is [[cor pulmonale]], a strain on the heart due to the extra work required by the heart to pump blood through the affected lungs.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_copd/page4.htm MedicineNet.com - COPD signs & symptoms]</ref> Symptoms of cor pulmonale are [[peripheral edema]], seen as swelling of the ankles, and dyspnea.  [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]] is usually not directly attributable to COPD and should indeed prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.<ref>Hanley ME. Chapter 2. The History & Physical Examination in Pulmonary Medicine. In: Hanley ME, Welsh CH, eds. CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment in Pulmonary Medicine.

There are a few [[medical sign|signs]] of COPD that a healthcare worker may detect although they can be seen in other diseases. Some people have COPD and have none of these signs. Common signs are:
* [[tachypnea]], a rapid breathing rate
* wheezing sounds or crackles in the lungs heard through a [[stethoscope]]
* breathing out taking a longer time than breathing in
* enlargement of the chest, particularly the front-to-back distance ([[hyperaeration]])
* active use of muscles in the neck to help with breathing
* breathing through pursed lips
* increased anteroposterior to lateral ratio of the chest (i.e. [[barrel chest]]).

==Cause==

===Smoking===
The primary risk factor for COPD is chronic tobacco smoking. In the [[United States]], 80 to 90% of cases of COPD are due to smoking.<ref name="medcauses">[http://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_copd/page3.htm MedicineNet.com - COPD causes]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Young RP, Hopkins RJ, Christmas T, Black PN, Metcalf P, Gamble GD |title=COPD prevalence is increased in lung cancer, independent of age, sex and smoking history |journal=Eur.

The likelihood of developing COPD increases with age and cumulative smoke exposure, and almost all lifelong smokers will develop COPD, provided that smoking-related, extrapulmonary diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, cancer) do not claim their lives beforehand.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68516-4}}</ref>

===Occupational exposures===
Intense and prolonged exposure to workplace dusts found in [[coal mining]], [[gold mining]], and the cotton textile industry and chemicals such as [[cadmium]], [[isocyanates]], and fumes from [[welding]]  have been implicated in the development of airflow obstruction, even in nonsmokers.<ref>{{cite journal

===Air pollution===
Studies in many countries have found people who live in large cities have a higher rate of COPD compared to people who live in rural areas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Halbert RJ, Natoli JL, Gano A, Badamgarav E, Buist AS, Mannino DM |title=Global burden of COPD: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Eur.

In many [[developing countries]], indoor air pollution from cooking fire smoke (often using [[biomass fuel]]s such as wood and animal dung) is a common cause of COPD, especially in women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kennedy SM, Chambers R, Du W, Dimich-Ward H |title=Environmental and occupational exposures: do they affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease differently in women and men?|journal=Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society|volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=692–4 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18073405 |url=http://pats.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/4/8/692 |doi=10.1513/pats.200707-094SD}}</ref> {{verification needed|date=February 2013}}

===Genetics===
Some factor in addition to heavy smoke exposure is required for a person to develop COPD. This factor is probably a [[gene]]tic susceptibility. COPD is more common among relatives of COPD patients who smoke than unrelated smokers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverman EK |title=Genetic epidemiology of severe, early-onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Risk to relatives for airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit.

[[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] is a genetic condition that is responsible for about 2% of cases of COPD. In this condition, the body does not make enough of a protein, [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]]. Alpha 1-antitrypsin protects the lungs from damage caused by [[protease]] [[enzymes]], such as [[elastase]] and [[trypsin]], that can be released as a result of an inflammatory response to tobacco smoke.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

===Autoimmune disease===
{{Main|Autoimmunity}}
There is mounting evidence that there may be an autoimmune component to COPD, triggered by lifelong smoking.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Agustí A, MacNee W, Donaldson K, Cosio M. |title=Hypothesis: Does COPD have an autoimmune component? |journal=Thorax |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=832–4 |year=2003 |pmid=14514931 |doi=10.1136/thorax.58.10.832 |pmc=1746486}}</ref> Many individuals with COPD who have stopped smoking have active inflammation in the lungs.<ref name=Rutgers00>{{cite journal |author=Rutgers SR |title=Ongoing airway inflammation in patients with COPD who do not currently smoke |journal=Thorax |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=12–8 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10607796 |pmc=1745599 |doi= 10.1136/thorax.55.1.12 |author-separator=, |author2=Postma DS |author3=ten Hacken NH |display-authors=3 |last4=Kauffman |first4=HF |last5=Van Der Mark |first5=TW |last6=Koëter |first6=GH |last7=Timens |first7=W}}</ref> The disease may continue to get worse for many years after stopping smoking due to this ongoing inflammation.<ref name=Rutgers00/> This sustained inflammation is thought to be mediated by [[autoantibodies]] and [[autoreactive T cell]]s.<ref name=Rutgers00/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Feghali-Bostwick CA |title=Autoantibodies in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease |journal=Am.

===Acute exacerbations===
{{Main|Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}}
An acute exacerbation of COPD is a sudden worsening of COPD symptoms (shortness of breath, quantity and color of phlegm) that typically lasts for several days. It may be triggered by an infection with bacteria or viruses or by environmental pollutants. Typically, infections cause 75% or more of the exacerbations; bacteria can be found in roughly 25% of cases, viruses in another 25%, and both viruses and bacteria in another 25%. [[Pulmonary Embolism|Pulmonary emboli]] can also cause exacerbations of COPD. Airway inflammation is increased during the exacerbation, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory air flow and worsening of gas transfer. This can also lead to hypoventilation and eventually hypoxia, insufficient tissue perfusion, and then cell necrosis.<ref name="pmid17507545"/>

===Other risk factors===
[[Bronchial hyperresponsiveness]], is a characteristic of asthma and refers to the increased sensitivity of the airways in response to an inhaled constrictor agonist. Many people with COPD also have this tendency. In COPD, the presence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness predicts a worse course of the disease.<ref name="Harrisons" /> It is not known if bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a cause or a consequence of COPD. Other risk factors such as repeated lung [[infection]] and possibly a diet high in cured meats (possibly due to the preservative [[sodium nitrite]]) may be related to the development of COPD.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:copd versus healthy lung.jpg|right|thumb|Enlarged view of lung tissue showing the difference between healthy lung and COPD]]
COPD is a type of [[obstructive lung disease]]. It is not fully understood how tobacco smoke and other inhaled particles damage the lungs to cause COPD. The most important processes causing lung damage are:
* [[Oxidative stress]] produced by the high concentrations of [[free radicals]] in tobacco smoke
* [[Cytokine]] release due to [[inflammation]] as the body responds to irritant particles such as tobacco smoke in the airway
* Tobacco smoke and free radicals impair the activity of antiprotease enzymes such as [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]], allowing [[protease]] enzymes to damage the lung

[[File:RanaGSJB et al 2010 Anal Bioanal Chem.jpg|thumb|  Potential role of [[coagulation]] and the [[complement system]] in COPD; a complex cascade of [[blood plasma]] proteins and platelet activation as molecular perturbations associated with patients suffering from COPD]]

Narrowing of the airways reduces the airflow rate to and from the air sacs ([[alveoli]]) and limits effectiveness of the lungs. In COPD, the greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out (during expiration) because the pressure in the chest tends to compress rather than expand the airways. In theory, air flow could be increased by breathing more forcefully, increasing the pressure in the chest during expiration. In COPD, there is often a limit to how much this can actually increase air flow, a situation known as expiratory flow limitation.<ref name="calverley">{{cite journal |author=Calverley PM, Koulouris NG |title=Flow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation: key concepts in modern respiratory physiology|journal=Eur Respir J |volume=25 |pages=186–199|year=2005|pmid=15640341 |doi=10.1183/09031936.04.00113204 |issue=1}}</ref>

If the rate of airflow is too low, a person with COPD may not be able to completely finish breathing out (expiration) before he or she needs to take another breath. This is particularly common during exercise, when breathing must be faster. A little of the air of the previous breath remains within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting in an increase in the volume of air in the lungs, a process called dynamic [[Hyperaeration|hyperinflation]].<ref name="calverley"/>

Dynamic hyperinflation is closely linked to [[dyspnea]] in COPD.<ref name="o'donnell">{{cite journal |author=O'Donnell DE|title=Hyperinflation, Dyspnea, and Exercise Intolerance in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|journal=The Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society|volume=3 |pages=180–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16565429 |doi=10.1513/pats.200508-093DO |issue=2}}</ref> It is less comfortable to breathe with hyperinflation because it takes more effort to move the lungs and [[chest wall]] when they are already stretched by hyperinflation.

Another factor contributing to shortness of breath in COPD is the loss of the [[surface area]] available for the exchange of oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]] with emphysema. This reduces the rate of transfer of these gases between the body and the atmosphere and can lead to low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels in the body. A person with emphysema may have to breathe faster or more deeply to compensate, which can be difficult to do if there is also flow limitation or hyperinflation.

Some people with advanced COPD do manage to breathe fast to compensate, but usually have dyspnea as a result. Others, who may be less short of breath, tolerate low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels in their bodies, but this can eventually lead to headaches, drowsiness and heart failure.

Advanced COPD can lead to complications beyond the lungs, such as weight loss ([[cachexia]]), [[pulmonary hypertension]] and right-sided heart failure ([[cor pulmonale]]). [[Osteoporosis]], [[heart disease]], [[muscle wasting]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] are all more common in people with COPD.<ref name="pmid17507545"/>

Several molecular signatures associated to lung function decline and corollaries of disease severity have been proposed, a majority of which are characterized in easily accessible surrogate tissue, including blood derivatives such as serum and plasma. A recent 2010 clinical study proposes alpha 1B-glycoprotein precursor/[[A1BG]], [[alpha 2-antiplasmin]], apolipoprotein A-IV precursor/[[APOA4]], and [[complement component 3]] precursor, among other [[coagulation]] and [[complement system]] proteins as corollaries of lung function decline, although ambiguity between cause and effect is unresolved.<ref name="RANAGS_et_al_2010">{{cite journal |author=Rana GS |title=Proteomic biomarkers in plasma that differentiate rapid and slow decline in lung function in adult cigarette smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)|journal=Anal Bioanal Chem |year=2010 |pmid= 20442989|doi=10.1007/s00216-010-3742-4 |volume=397 |issue=5 |pages=1809–19 |author-separator=, |author2=York TP |author3=Edmiston JS |author4=Zedler BK |display-authors=4 |last5=Pounds |first5=Joel G. |last6=Adkins |first6=Joshua N. |last7=Smith |first7=Richard D. |last8=Liu |first8=Zaigang |last9=Li |first9=Guoya}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:COPD.JPG|thumb|A chest X-ray demonstrating severe COPD. Note the small size of the heart in comparison to the lungs.]]

The diagnosis of COPD should be considered in anyone who has [[dyspnea]], chronic cough or sputum production, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease such as regular tobacco smoking.<ref name="pmid17507545"/><ref name="pmid7956395">{{cite journal |author=Badgett RG |title=The clinical evaluation for diagnosing obstructive airways disease in high-risk patients |journal=Chest |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=1427–31 |year=1994 |pmid=7956395| doi = 10.1378/chest.106.1427 |doi_brokendate=2010-04-06 |author-separator=, |author2=Tanaka DJ |author3=Hunt DK |display-authors=3 |last4=Jelley |first4=MJ |last5=Feinberg |first5=LE |last6=Steiner |first6=JF |last7=Petty |first7=TL}}</ref> No single symptom or sign can adequately confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COPD,<ref name="pmid7815660">{{cite journal |author=Holleman DR, Simel DL |title=Does the clinical examination predict airflow limitation? |journal=JAMA |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=313–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7815660| doi = 10.1001/jama.273.4.313}}</ref> although COPD is uncommon under the age of 40&nbsp;years.

===Spirometry===
The diagnosis of COPD is confirmed by [[spirometry]],<ref name="pmid17507545"/> a test that measures the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a large breath. Spirometry also measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a whole large breath. Normally, at least 70% of the FVC comes out in the first second (i.e. the [[FEV1/FVC|FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio]] is >70%). A ratio less than normal defines the patient as having COPD. More specifically, the diagnosis of COPD is made when the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio is <70%.<ref name=Nathell/> The GOLD criteria (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) also require that values are after [[bronchodilator]] medication has been given to make the diagnosis, and the NICE criteria also require FEV1%.<ref name=Nathell/> According to the ERS criteria, it is [[FEV1% predicted]] that defines when a patient has COPD, that is, when FEV1% predicted is < 88% for men, or < 89% for women.<ref name=Nathell/>

Spirometry can help to determine the severity of COPD.<ref name="pmid17507545"/> The FEV<sub>1</sub> (measured after bronchodilator medication) is expressed as a percentage of a predicted "normal" value based on a person's age, gender, height and weight:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;width:100%;"
|-
! Severity of COPD (GOLD scale)!! FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted
|-
| Mild (GOLD 1) || ≥80
|-
| Moderate (GOLD 2)|| 50–79
|-
| Severe (GOLD 3) || 30–49
|-
| Very severe (GOLD 4)|| <30 or chronic respiratory failure symptoms
|}

The severity of COPD also depends on the severity of dyspnea and exercise limitation. These and other factors can be combined with spirometry results to obtain a COPD severity score that takes multiple dimensions of the disease into account.<ref name=Celli04>{{cite journal |author=Celli BR |title=The body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity index in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=N.

===Other tests===
On [[chest x-ray]], the classic signs of COPD are overexpanded lung ([[Hyperaeration|hyperinflation]]), a flattened diaphragm, increased retrosternal airspace, and bullae.<ref name=Old2007>{{cite journal |author=Torres M, Moayedi S |title=Evaluation of the acutely dyspneic elderly patient |journal=Clin. Geriatr. Med. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=307–25, vi |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17462519 |doi=10.1016/j.cger.2007.01.007 |url=}}</ref> It can be useful to help exclude other lung diseases, such as [[pneumonia]], [[pulmonary edema]] or a [[pneumothorax]].<ref name=Old2007/> Complete pulmonary function tests with measurements of lung volumes and gas transfer may also show hyperinflation and can discriminate between COPD with emphysema and COPD without emphysema. A high-resolution [[computed tomography]] scan of the chest may show the distribution of emphysema throughout the lungs and can also be useful to exclude other lung diseases.

A blood sample taken from an [[artery]], i.e. [[Arterial Blood Gas]] (ABG), can be tested for blood gas levels which may show low oxygen (hypoxaemia) and/or high carbon dioxide (respiratory acidosis if pH is also decreased). A blood sample taken from a [[vein]] may show a high blood count (reactive polycythemia), a reaction to long-term hypoxemia.

==Prevention==
Annual [[influenza vaccination]]s and pneumococcal vaccinations may be beneficial.

===Smoking cessation===
{{Main|Smoking cessation}}
Smoking cessation is one of the most important factors in slowing down the progression of COPD. Once COPD has been diagnosed, stopping smoking slows down the rate of progression of the disease. Even at a late stage of the disease, it can significantly reduce the rate of deterioration in lung function and delay the onset of disability and death.<ref name=kc /> It is the only standard intervention that can improve the rate of progression of COPD.<ref name=Drummond08/>

Smoking cessation starts with an individual decision to stop smoking that leads to an attempt at quitting. Often several attempts are required before long-term smoking cessation is achieved.<ref name = "WHO">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/resources/publications/tobacco_dependence/en/|title= World Health Organization Tobacco Free Initiative - Policy recommendations for smoking cessation and treatment of tobacco dependence|accessdate=28 July 2008}}</ref> Some smokers can achieve long-term smoking cessation through "willpower" alone. However, smoking is highly addictive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2278.aspx?CategoryID=53&SubCategoryID=536 |title=Why is smoking addictive? |work=NHS Choices }}</ref> and many smokers need further support to quit. The chance of successfully stopping smoking can be greatly improved through social support, engagement in a smoking cessation programme and the use of drugs such as [[nicotine replacement therapy]], [[bupropion]] and [[varenicline]].<ref name="WHO"/>

The [[Tobacco smoking#Legal_issues_and_regulation|policies]] of governments, public health agencies and antismoking organizations can reduce smoking rates by encouraging smoking cessation and discouraging people from starting smoking.<ref name="WHO"/> These policies are important strategies in the prevention of COPD.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Occupational health===
Measures can be taken to reduce the likelihood that workers in at-risk industries—such as coal mining, construction and stonemasonry-will develop COPD. Examples of these measures include: education of workers and management about the risks, promoting [[smoking cessation]], [[disease surveillance|surveillance]] of workers for early signs of COPD, use of personal dust monitors, use of [[respirators]], and dust control.<ref>{{cite web |first=Fred N. |last=Kissell |title=Handbook for Dust Control in Mining |date=June 2003 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/UserFiles/works/pdfs/2003-147.pdf |format=PDF |id=Information Circular 9465 }}</ref> Dust control can be achieved by improving ventilation, using water sprays and by using mining techniques that minimize dust generation.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/copd/casestudies/wetcut.htm Wet cutting] Health and Safety Executive (UK Government). Accessed March 20, 2012.</ref> If a worker develops COPD, further lung damage can be reduced by avoiding ongoing dust exposure, for example by changing the work role.

===Air pollution===
Air quality can be improved by [[Air pollution#Reduction efforts|pollution reduction efforts]], which should lead to health gains for people with COPD. A person who has COPD may experience fewer symptoms if they stay indoors on days when air quality is poor.<ref name="pmid17507545" />

== Management ==
There is currently no cure for COPD; however, COPD is both preventable and treatable.[[Clinical practice guideline]]s for the management of COPD are available from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD),<ref>[http://www.goldcopd.org/ Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease].</ref> a collaboration that includes the World Health Organization and the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The major current directions of COPD management are to assess and monitor the disease, reduce the risk factors, manage stable COPD, prevent and treat acute exacerbations and manage [[comorbidity]].<ref name="pmid17507545" />

The only measures that have been shown to reduce mortality is smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen.<ref name=Drummond08>{{cite journal |author=Drummond MB, Dasenbrook EC, Pitz MW, Murphy DJ, Fan E|title=Inhaled corticosteroids in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=20 |pages=2407–16 |year=2008|month=November |pmid=19033591 |doi=10.1001/jama.2008.717 }}</ref>

===Bronchodilators===
[[Bronchodilators]] are medicines that relax [[smooth muscle]] around the airways, increasing the calibre of the airways and improving air flow. They can reduce the symptoms of shortness of breath, wheeze and exercise limitation, resulting in an improved quality of life for people with COPD.<ref name="pmid11834677">{{cite journal |author=Liesker JJ, Wijkstra PJ, Ten Hacken NH, Koëter GH, Postma DS, Kerstjens HA |title=A systematic review of the effects of bronchodilators on exercise capacity in patients with COPD |journal=Chest |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=597–608 |year=2002 |month=February|pmid=11834677 |doi= 10.1378/chest.121.2.597 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11834677}}</ref> They do not slow down the rate of progression of the underlying disease.<ref name="pmid17507545" /> Bronchodilators are usually administered with an [[inhaler]] or via a [[nebulizer]].

There are two major types of bronchodilator,  β<sub>2</sub> agonists and anticholinergics. Anticholinergics appear superior to β<sub>2</sub> agonists in COPD. Anticholinergics reduce respiratory deaths while β<sub>2</sub> agonists have no effect on respiratory deaths.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Salpeter SR, Buckley NS, Salpeter EE |title=Meta-analysis: Anticholinergics, but not β-agonists, Reduce Severe Exacerbations and Respiratory Mortality in COPD |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=21|issue=10 |pages=1011–9 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16970553 |pmc=1831628|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00507.x }}</ref>  Each type may be either long-acting (with an effect lasting 12&nbsp;hours or more) or short-acting (with a rapid onset of effect that does not last as long).

====β<sub>2</sub> agonists====
β<sub>2</sub> agonists stimulate β<sub>2</sub> [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on airway smooth muscles, causing them to relax. There are several β<sub>2</sub> agonists available. [[Salbutamol]](common brand name: Ventolin) and [[terbutaline]] are widely used short acting β<sub>2</sub> agonists and provide rapid relief of COPD symptoms. Long acting β<sub>2</sub> agonists (LABAs) such as [[salmeterol]] and [[formoterol]] are used as maintenance therapy and lead to improved airflow, exercise capacity, and quality of life.<ref name="pmid17314337">{{cite journal |author=Calverley PM|title=Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|journal=N.

====Anticholinergics====
Anticholinergic drugs cause airway smooth muscles to relax by blocking stimulation from [[cholinergic]] nerves. [[Ipratropium]] provides short-acting rapid relief of COPD symptoms. [[Tiotropium]] is a long-acting anticholinergic whose regular use is associated with improvements in airflow, exercise capacity, and quality of life. Ipratropium is associated with increased cardiovascular [[morbidity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ogale SS, Lee TA, Au DH, Boudreau DM, Sullivan SD|title=Cardiovascular events associated with ipratropium bromide in COPD |journal=Chest |volume=137|issue=1 |pages=13–9 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19363211 |doi=10.1378/chest.08-2367|url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/137/1/13.abstract}}</ref>

===Corticosteroids===
[[Corticosteroid]]s are used in tablet or inhaled form to treat and prevent acute exacerbations of COPD. Well-inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have not shown benefit for people with mild COPD, however, they have been shown to decrease acute exacerbations in those with either moderate or severe COPD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gartlehner G, Hansen RA, Carson SS, Lohr KN |title=Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Corticosteroids in Patients With COPD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Health Outcomes |journal=Ann Fam Med |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=253–62 |year=2006 |pmid=16735528 |pmc=1479432|doi=10.1370/afm.517 }}</ref>  They however have no effect on overall one-year mortality and are associated with increased rates of pneumonia.<ref name="Drummond08"/>

===Other medication===
[[Antibiotics]] specifically [[macrolides]] such as [[azithromycin]] reduce the number of exacerbations in those who have two or more a year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mammen|first=MJ|coauthors=Sethi, S|title=Macrolide therapy for the prevention of acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.|journal=Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej|year=2012|volume=122|issue=1-2|pages=54–9|pmid=22353707}}</ref>

[[Theophylline]] is a bronchodilator and [[phosphodiesterase]] inhibitor that in high doses can reduce symptoms for some people who have COPD. More often, side effects such as nausea and stimulation of the heart limit its use.<ref name="pmid17507545" />

===Supplemental oxygen===
[[File:Home oxygen concentrator.jpg|thumb|Oxygen can be delivered in different forms: in large containers, in smaller containers with [[liquid oxygen]], or with the use of an [[oxygen concentrator]](''shown here''), which derives oxygen from room air. The latter two options improve mobility of people requiring long-term oxygen therapy.]]
[[Supplemental oxygen]] or oxygen therapy can improve oxygen saturation levels, allowing patients with COPD or low oxygen levels to maintain their mobility and increase their ability to complete activities of daily living (ADL), such as exercise, household chores, shopping, etc. [[oxygen therapy|Long-term oxygen therapy]] for at least 16&nbsp;hours a day can improve the quality of life and survival for people with COPD and arterial [[hypoxemia]] or with complications of hypoxemia such as [[pulmonary hypertension]], [[cor pulmonale]], or secondary [[erythrocytosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Long term domiciliary oxygen therapy in chronic hypoxic cor pulmonale complicating chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Report of the Medical Research Council Working Party |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8222 |pages=681–6 |year=1981 |month=March|pmid=6110912 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(81)91970-X|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(81)91970-X |author1= <Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> High concentrations of supplemental oxygen can lead to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and [[respiratory acidosis]] for some people with severe COPD; lower oxygen flow rates are generally safer for these individuals. Another safety issue concerning the use of oxygen for patients with COPD is smoking, because oxygen can act as an oxidizing agent.

=== Other measures ===
[[Pulmonary rehabilitation]] is a program of exercise, disease management and counselling coordinated to benefit the individual.<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Copd/Copd_Treatments.htmlU.S.National Heart Lung and Blood Institute - Treatment]</ref> Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve shortness of breath and exercise capacity. It has also been shown to improve the sense of control a patient has over their disease as well as their emotions.<ref name="pmid12137716">{{cite journal |author=Lacasse Y |title=Pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|issue=3 |pages=CD003793|year=2002|pmid=12137716 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003793 |editor1-last=Lacasse|editor1-first=Yves|author-separator=, |author2=Brosseau L |author3=Milne S |display-authors=3 |last4=Martin |first4=S|last5=Wong |first5=E |last6=Guyatt |first6=GH |last7=Goldstein |first7=RS}}</ref>

Being either underweight or overweight can affect the symptoms, degree of disability and prognosis of COPD. People with COPD who are underweight can improve their breathing muscle strength by increasing their calorie intake.<ref name="pmid17507545" /> When combined with regular exercise or a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, this can lead to improvements in COPD symptoms.

Surgery is sometimes helpful for COPD in selected cases. A bullectomy is the surgical removal of a bulla, a large air-filled space that can squash the surrounding, more normal lung. [[Lung volume reduction surgery]] is similar; parts of the lung that are particularly damaged by emphysema are removed allowing the remaining, relatively good lung to expand and work better. [[Lung transplantation]] is sometimes performed for severe COPD, particularly in younger individuals.

Obesity, poor nutrition, depression and social isolation are looked at. Palliative care for end of life needs is important. Morphine and benzodiazepines are used in low doses to reduce anxiety. In advanced critical illness, decisions about resuscitation are addressed. [[Infliximab]] has been tested in COPD but there was no evidence of benefit with the possibility of harm.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rennard SI |title=The safety and efficacy of infliximab in moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.|volume=175 |issue=9 |pages=926–34 |year=2007 |month=May|pmid=17290043|doi=10.1164/rccm.200607-995OC|author-separator=, |author2=Fogarty C |author3=Kelsen S|display-authors=3|last4=Long |first4=W.|last5=Ramsdell |first5=J. |last6=Allison |first6=J.|last7=Mahler |first7=D. |last8=Saadeh|first8=C.|last9=Siler |first9=T.}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
COPD usually gradually gets worse over time and can lead to death. The rate at which it gets worse varies among individuals. The factors that predict a poorer prognosis are:<ref name="pmid17507545" />
*Severe airflow obstruction (low FEV<sub>1</sub>)
*Poor exercise capacity
*Shortness of breath
*Significantly underweight or overweight
*Complications like respiratory failure or cor pulmonale
*Continued smoking
*Frequent acute exacerbations

Prognosis in COPD can be estimated using the Bode Index. This scoring system uses FEV1, body-mass index, 6-minute walk distance, and the modified MRC dyspnea scale to estimate outcomes in COPD.<ref name=Celli04/>

==History==
COPD has probably always existed but has been called by different names in the past. Bonet described a condition of  "voluminous lungs" in 1679. In 1769, [[Giovanni Morgagni]] described 19 cases where the lungs were "turgid" particularly from air.<ref name="pmid18046898">{{cite journal |author=Petty TL |title=The history of COPD |journal=Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |year=2006 |pmid=18046898 |pmc=2706597 |doi=10.2147/copd.2006.1.1.3}}</ref> The first description and illustration of the enlarged airspaces in emphysema was provided by Ruysh in 1721.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhprofessional.com/downloads/products/0071457399/0071457399_chap40.pdf|format=PDF|title= History of pathologic descriptions of COPD}}</ref> [[Matthew Baillie]] illustrated an emphysematous lung in 1789 and described the destructive character of the condition.<ref name="pmid18046898" /> Badham used the word "catarrh" to describe the cough and mucus hypersecretion of chronic bronchitis in 1814. He recognised that chronic bronchitis was a disabling disorder.

[[René Laennec]], the physician who invented the [[stethoscope]], used the term "emphysema" in his book ''A Treatise on the Diseases of the Chest and of Mediate Auscultation'' (1837) to describe lungs that did not collapse when he opened the chest during an autopsy. He noted that they did not collapse as usual because they were full of air and the airways were filled with mucus.<ref name="pmid18046898"/>

In 1842, [[John Hutchinson]] invented the [[spirometer]], which allowed the measurement of vital capacity of the lungs. However, his spirometer could only measure volume, not airflow.<ref name="pmid15849329">{{cite journal |author=Fishman AP |title=One hundred years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=171 |issue=9 |pages=941–8 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15849329 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200412-1685OE}}</ref> Tiffeneau in 1947 and Gaensler in 1950 and 1951 described the principles of measuring airflow.

The terms chronic bronchitis and emphysema were formally defined at the CIBA guest symposium of physicians in 1959. The term COPD was first used by William Briscoe in 1965 and has gradually overtaken other terms to become established today as the preferred name for this disease.
