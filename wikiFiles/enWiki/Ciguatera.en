'''Ciguatera''' is a [[foodborne illness]] caused by eating certain [[reef fish]] whose flesh is contaminated with toxins originally produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s such as ''[[Gambierdiscus toxicus]]'' which live in tropical and subtropical waters. These dinoflagellates adhere to [[coral]], [[algae]] and [[seaweed]], where they are eaten by [[herbivorous]] fish who in turn are eaten by larger [[carnivorous]] fish. In this way the toxins move up the [[food chain]] and [[bioaccumulate]]. ''Gambierdiscus toxicus'' is the primary dinoflagellate responsible for the production of a number of similar toxins that cause ciguatera. These toxins include [[ciguatoxin]], [[maitotoxin]], [[scaritoxin]] and [[palytoxin]]. [[Predator]] species near the top of the food chain in tropical and subtropical waters, such as [[barracuda]]s, [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], [[moray eel]]s, [[parrotfish]]es, [[grouper]]s, [[triggerfish]]es and [[amberjack]]s, are most likely to cause ciguatera poisoning, although many other species cause occasional outbreaks of toxicity. Ciguatoxin is odourless, tasteless and very heat-resistant, so ciguatoxin-laden fish cannot be detoxified by conventional [[cooking]].<ref name="Swift-1993">{{cite journal |author=Swift A, Swift T |title=Ciguatera |journal=J.

==Detection methods==

===Scientific detection===
Currently, multiple laboratory methods are available to detect ciguatoxins, including [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (LCMS), [[receptor binding]] [[assay]]s, and [[neuroblastoma]] [[assays]]). Although testing is possible, in most cases, LCMS is insufficient to detect clinically relevant concentrations of ciguatoxin in crude extracts of fish.

===Folk detection===
In Northern Australia, where ciguatera is a common problem, two different [[folk science]] methods are widely believed to detect whether fish harbor significant ciguatoxin. The first method is that flies will not land on contaminated fish. The second is that cats display symptoms after eating contaminated fish. A third, less common testing method involves putting a silver coin under the scales of the suspect fish. Only if the coin turns black, is it contaminated. It is not known whether any of these tests produce accurate results.

On Grand Cayman island the locals will test barracuda by placing a piece of the fish on the ground and allowing ants to crawl on it. If the ants continue to move then the fish is safe to eat.

===Folk remedies===
Various Caribbean folk and ritualistic treatments originated in [[Cuba]] and nearby islands. The most common old-time remedy involves bed rest subsequent to a [[guanabana]] juice [[enema]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Other folk treatments range from directly porting and bleeding the gastrointestinal tract to "cleansing" the diseased with a dove during a [[Santería]] ritual {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. In [[Puerto Rico]], natives drink a [[tea]] made from [[mangrove]] buttons, purportedly high in [[B Vitamins]], to flush the toxic symptoms from the system {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The efficacy of these treatments has never been studied or substantiated.

An account of ciguatera poisoning from a linguistics researcher living on Malakula island, Vanuatu, indicates the local treatment:  "We had to go with what local people told us: avoid salt and any seafood.  Eat sugary foods.  And they gave us a tea made from the roots of ferns growing on tree trunks. I don't know if any of that helped, but after a few weeks, the symptoms faded away."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dimock, L |title=Rescue mission for fading tongue |journal=New Zealand Education Review. |issue=[3] |pages=3 |year=2010 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no effective treatment or antidote for ciguatera poisoning. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care. There is some evidence that [[calcium channel blocker]] type drugs such as [[Nifedipine]] and [[Verapamil]] are effective in treating some of the symptoms that remain after the initial sickness passes, such as poor circulation and shooting pains through the chest. These symptoms are due to the cramping of [[arterial]] walls caused by [[maitotoxin]]<ref name=uhm/><ref>{{cite book |author=Attaway D, Zaborsky O |title=Marine Biotechnology |pages=8 |year=1993 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Fleming L |title=Ciguatera Fish Poisoning &#124;[http://www.whoi.edu/redtide/page.do?pid=9679&tid=523&cid=27687]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Schlossberg D |title=Infections of leisure | page=13 | year=1999 | isbn=3-540-94069-3}}</ref> Ciguatoxin lowers the threshold for opening [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s in [[synapse]]s of the [[nervous system]].

==Epidemiology==
Due to the limited habitats of ciguatoxin-producing microorganisms, ciguatera is common in only [[subtropical]] and [[tropics|tropical waters]], particularly the Pacific and Caribbean, and usually is associated with fish caught in tropical reef waters.<ref name="Isbister-2005"/> Ciguatoxin is found in over 400 species of reef fish. Avoiding consumption of all reef fish (any fish living in warm tropical waters) is the only sure way to avoid exposure.<ref name="Schep">{{cite journal |author=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Temple WA, Beasley DM |title=Ciguatera poisoning: an increasing occurrence in New Zealand |journal=N.

In February 2008, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) traced several outbreaks to the [[Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary]] in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], near the [[Texas]]&ndash;[[Louisiana]] shoreline. The FDA advised seafood processors that ciguatera poisoning was "reasonably likely" to occur from eating several species of fish caught as far as {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the sanctuary.<ref>{{cite press release | title = FDA Advises Seafood Processors About Ciguatera Fish Poisoning in the Northern Gulf of Mexico Near the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date = 2008-02-05 | url = http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01790.html | accessdate = 2008-02-07}}</ref>

From August 2010 to July 2011, there were six outbreaks of Ciguatera Fish Poisoning in New York City. Outbreaks were linked to barracuda and grouper purchased at a fish market in Queens, New York. <ref>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6204a1.htm?s_cid=mm6204a1_e</ref>

In Q1 2012, two restaurants in [[Lanzarote]] are thought to have been the source of ciguatera poisoning, leading to new fishing regulations issued 18 April 2012. The first outbreak was reported after eating amberjack in February 2012. The diners suffered with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain several hours later. The second case was in early April affecting six people who live in Lanzarote and had all eaten amberjack at a local restaurant.<ref>http://www.lanzaroteinformation.com/content/isolated-cases-ciguatera-poisoning-lanzarote</ref>

==History==
Ciguatera was first described by one of the surgeon's mates, [[William Anderson (naturalist)|William Anderson]], on the crew of [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS Resolution]] in 1774.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Fish Tale|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/magazine/11FOB-diagnosis-t.html?ref=magazine |quote=The illness was first described in 1774 by a surgeon's mate on the crew of Captain Cook's South Pacific exploration aboard the HMS Resolution. The crewman, John Anderson, documented the symptoms described by several shipmates who had eaten a large fish caught in the tropical waters.  |work=[[New York Times]] |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-10 | first1=Lisa | last1=Sanders}} (The ''New York Times'' incorrectly gives William Anderson's first name as John.)</ref>

Originally, ciguatoxin was linked to [[poison]] passed to tropical fish through consumption. However, the exact source of the toxin was unknown, and many sources were identified as the culprit. Some of these included the [[manchineel]] fruit, ''[[Cocculus]]'' berries, [[Eunicidae|palolo worms]], compounds containing [[copper]], [[pumice]], and ''[[Corallinales|Corallina opuntia]]''.

It is a generally held theory that ciguatera, as a poisonous substance, was named and identified in [[Cuba]], circa the early 1800s. Local folklore has identified that the etymology stems from a story of an Englishman who caught a barracuda on the [[Isla de Pinos]]. After consuming the barracuda, the Englishman became terribly ill. When queried about the origins of his illness, the Englishman claimed to have caught and eaten "a fish, from the seawater".  This gave rise to the name of the ailment as ''ciguatera'', a transliteration into Spanish of the English word ''seawater'' (The term for seawater in Spanish is "agua salada" or "agua de mar").{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. A more commonly encountered explanation is that ciguatera comes from the word 'Cigua', a Cuban name for a gastropod that caused similar symptoms. Captain Cook, during his voyages in the ''Endeavour'' (1700s) when off New Caledonia, describes eating a fish 'with a large ugly head' and goes on to describe symptoms consistent with ciguatera poisoning.
