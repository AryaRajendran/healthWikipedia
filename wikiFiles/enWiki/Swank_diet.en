The '''Swank Diet''' is a [[saturated fat|low saturated fat]] [[dieting|diet]] for the [[treatment of multiple sclerosis]] developed by [[Roy L. Swank]] (1909-2008), which he introduced in 1948. Swank's research has been disputed due to [[methodological]] concerns.
Currently there is not enough evidence to suggest that dietary interventions have any major effect on the course of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="pmid23235605"/>

==The diet==
The diet consists of:

#[[Saturated fat]] should not exceed 15 grams per day
#[[Unsaturated fat]] (oils) should be kept to 20-50 grams per day
#No [[red meat]] for the first year; after that, a maximum of 3 oz. (85 grams) of red meat per week
#[[Dairy]] products must contain 1% or less [[butterfat]]
#No [[processed foods]] containing [[saturated fat]]
#A good source of [[omega-3]] ([[oily fish]], [[cod liver oil]], cod liver oil tablets, etc.) along with a multi-vitamin and mineral supplement are recommended daily
#[[Wheat]], [[gluten]] or [[dairy]] product quantities are not restricted. But foods which cause [[allergies]] or reactions to an MS sufferer should be avoided

==Research==
Swank's research on 144 patients over a 34-year period was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1990. The study indicated that those who followed the diet had not shown any significant deterioration of their condition over a 34-year period, while those that did not follow the diet did significantly deteriorate over the same period.<ref name="pmid1973220">{{cite journal |author=Swank RL, Dugan BB |title=Effect of low saturated fat diet in early and late cases of multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet |volume=336 |issue=8706 |pages=37–9 |year=1990 |month=July |pmid=1973220 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(90)91533-G|url=}}</ref><ref>Swank RL, Goodwin J (2003).

Swank's research has been disputed because it lacked [[Blind experiment|double-blind testing]]. Moreover, overall evidence is insufficient to indicate any potential benefit from diet interventions in MS.<ref name="pmid23235605">{{cite cochrane|last=Farinotti|first=M|coauthors=Vacchi, L; Simi, S; Di Pietrantonj, C; Brait, L; Filippini, G|title=Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Dec 12|volume=12|review=CD004192|pmid=23235605}}</ref>
