The '''glomerular basement membrane''' (GBM) of the [[kidney]] is the [[basal lamina]] layer of the [[glomerulus]]. The [[Glomerulus#Endothelial cells|glomerular capillary endothelial cells]], the GBM and the [[filtration slits]] between the [[podocytes]] perform the [[Ultrafiltration (renal)|filtration function]] of the glomerulus, separating the blood in the capillaries from the filtrate that forms in [[Bowman's capsule]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|19374010}}</ref> The GBM is a fusion of the endothelial cell and podocyte basal laminas. <ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch04/7ch04p07}} - "Basement Membrane"</ref>

==Layers==
The GBM contains three layers: <ref>[http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/116/8/2090/F1 JCI - New articles published<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The glomerular membrane consists of [[mesangial cell]]s, modified pericytes that in other parts of the body separate capillaries from each other. The podocytes adjoining them have filtration slits of diameter 25 nm that are formed by the pseudopodia arising from them. The filtration slits are covered by a diaphragm that includes the transmembrane protein [[nephrin]].

==Pathology==
[[Image:Membranous nephropathy - cropped - mpas - very high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing GBM spike formation in [[membranous nephropathy]]. [[Jones stain]].]]
* [[Goodpasture's syndrome]] is also known as "anti-glomerular basement membrane disease". Capillaries become inflamed as a result of damage to the basement membrane by [[antibodies]] to type 4 collagen. 
* [[Nephrotic syndrome]] is a change in the structure of the glomerular filtration mechanism usually in the glomerular basement membrane. Some symptoms include [[proteinuria]], [[hypoalbuminaemia]], [[oedema]], and [[hyperlipidemia]].
* Diabetic [[glomerulosclerosis]] is a thickening of the basement membrane, which can become up to 4-5 times thicker than normal. Can be caused by [[insulin|insulin deficiency]] or resultant [[hyperglycemia]].
