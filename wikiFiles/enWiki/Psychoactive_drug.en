[[File:Pyschoactive Drugs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An assortment of psychoactive drugs]]
A '''psychoactive drug''', '''psychopharmaceutical''', or '''psychotropic''' is a [[chemical substance]] that crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] and acts primarily upon the [[central nervous system]] where it affects [[brain]] function, resulting in alterations in [[perception]], [[mood (psychology)|mood]], [[consciousness]], [[cognition]], and [[behavior]].<ref name="bushbook">{{cite book|chapter=CHAPTER 1 Alcohol and Other Drugs|isbn=0-7245-3361-3|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/health/healthdev/health_promotion/bushbook/volume2/chap1/sect1.htm}}</ref> These substances may be used [[recreational drug use|recreationally]], to purposefully alter one's [[consciousness]], or as [[entheogens]], for ritual, spiritual, and/or [[Shamans|shamanic]] purposes, as a tool for studying or augmenting the mind.   Many psychoactive drugs have therapeutic utility,  e.g.,  as [[anesthetic]]s, [[analgesic]]s, or for the treatment of [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorders]].

Psychoactive substances often bring about subjective changes in consciousness and mood that the user may find pleasant (e.g. euphoria) or advantageous (e.g. increased alertness) and are thus reinforcing.   Thus, many psychoactive substances are [[substance abuse|abused]], that is, used excessively, despite health risks or negative consequences. With sustained use of some substances, [[psychological dependence|psychological]] and [[physical dependence]] (''"addiction"'') may develop, making the cycle of abuse even more difficult to interrupt. [[Drug rehabilitation]] aims to break this cycle of dependency, through a combination of [[psychotherapy]], support groups, maintenance and even other psychoactive substances. However, the reverse is also true in some cases, that certain experiences on drugs may be so unfriendly and uncomforting that the user may never want to try the substance again. This is especially true of the [[deliriant]]s (e.g. ''[[Datura stramonium|Jimson weed]]'') and powerful [[dissociative]]s (e.g. ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''). Most purely [[psychedelic drugs]] are considered to be non-addictive ([[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], [[mescaline]] etc.); "psychedelic amphetamines" or [[empathogen-entactogen]]s (such as [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], [[MDMA]] etc.) may produce an additional stimulant and/or euphoriant effect, and thus have an addiction potential.

In part because of this potential for abuse and dependency, the ethics of drug use are debated. Many governments worldwide place restrictions on drug production and sales in an attempt to decrease drug abuse. [[Neuroethics|Ethical concerns]] have also been raised about over-use of these drugs clinically, and about their marketing by manufacturers.

== History ==
Psychoactive drug use dates to [[prehistoric]] times. There is archaeological evidence of the use of psychoactive substances (mostly plants) dating back at least 10,000 years, and historical evidence of cultural use over the past 5,000 years.<ref name="merlin">{{cite journal | author=Merlin, M.D | title=Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World | journal=Economic Botany | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages= 295–323 | doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057[0295:AEFTTO]2.0.CO;2 | year=2003 }}</ref> The chewing of coca leaves, for example, dates back over 8000 years ago in Peruvian society.<ref>Early Holocene coca chewing in northern Peru Volume: 84  Number: 326  Page: 939–953</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11878241 | work=BBC News | title=Coca leaves first chewed 8,000 years ago, says research | date=December 2, 2010}}</ref>

Medicinal use is one important facet of psychoactive drug usage. However, some have postulated that the urge to alter one's consciousness is as primary as the drive to satiate thirst, hunger or sexual desire.<ref name="siegel">{{cite book | author=Siegel, Ronald K| title=Intoxication: The Universal Drive for Mind-Altering Substances| publisher=Park Street Press, Rochester, Vermont | year=2005 | isbn=1-59477-069-7}}</ref> The long history of drug use and even children's desire for spinning, swinging, or sliding indicates that the drive to alter one's state of mind is universal.<ref name="weil">{{cite book | last=Weil | first=Andrew | year=2004 | title=The Natural Mind: A Revolutionary Approach to the Drug Problem (Revised edition) | page=15 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=0-618-46513-8}}</ref>

One of the first people to articulate this point of view, set aside from a medicinal context, was American author [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] (1836–1870) in his book ''[[The Hasheesh Eater]]'' (1857): "...drugs are able to bring humans into the neighborhood of divine experience and can thus carry us up from our personal fate and the everyday circumstances of our life into a higher form of reality.  It is, however, necessary to understand precisely what is meant by the use of drugs.  We do not mean the purely physical craving...That of which we speak is something much higher, namely the knowledge of the possibility of the soul to enter into a lighter being, and to catch a glimpse of deeper insights and more magnificent visions of the beauty, truth, and the divine than we are normally able to spy through the cracks in our prison cell.  But there are not many drugs which have the power of stilling such craving.  The entire catalog, at least to the extent that research has thus far written it, may include only opium, hashish, and in rarer cases alcohol, which has enlightening effects only upon very particular characters."<ref>The Hashish Eater (1857) pg. 181</ref>

This relationship is not limited to humans. A number of animals consume different psychoactive plants, animals, berries and even fermented fruit, becoming intoxicated, such as cats after consuming [[nepeta|catnip]]. Traditional legends of sacred plants often contain references to animals that introduced humankind to their use.<ref name="samorini">{{cite book | last=Samorini | first=Giorgio | year=2002 | title=Animals And Psychedelics: The Natural World & The Instinct To Alter Consciousness | publisher=Park Street Press | isbn=0-89281-986-3 }}</ref> Biology suggests an evolutionary connection between psychoactive plants and animals, as to why these chemicals and their receptors exist within the nervous system.<ref name="albert">{{cite web | author=Albert, David Bruce, Jr. (1993) | title=Event Horizons of the Psyche | url=http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/event_horizons.html | accessdate=February 2, 2006}}</ref>

During the 20th century, many governments across the world initially responded to the use of recreational drugs by banning them and making their use, supply, or trade a criminal offense. A notable example of this is the [[Prohibition]] era in the United States, where alcohol was made illegal for 13 years. However, many governments, government officials and persons in law enforcement have concluded that illicit drug use cannot be sufficiently stopped through criminalization.  Organizations such as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) have come to such a conclusion believing "the existing drug policies have failed in their intended goals of addressing the problems of crime, drug abuse, addiction, juvenile drug use, stopping the flow of illegal drugs into this country and the internal sale and use of illegal drugs. By fighting a war on drugs the government has increased the problems of society and made them far worse. A system of regulation rather than prohibition is a less harmful, more ethical and a more effective public policy."<ref>http://www.leap.cc/cms/index.php?name=Content&pid=5</ref> In some countries, there has been a move toward harm reduction by health services, where the use of illicit drugs is neither condoned nor promoted, but services and support are provided to ensure users have adequate factual information readily available, and that the negative effects of their use be minimized. Such is the case of Portuguese drug policy of decriminalization, which achieved its primary goal of reducing the adverse health effects of drug abuse.<ref>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization</ref>

== Uses ==
Psychoactive substances are used by humans for a number of different purposes to achieve a specific end. These uses vary widely between cultures. Some substances may have controlled or illegal uses while others may have shamanic purposes, and still others are used medicinally. Other examples would be social drinking or sleep aids. [[Caffeine]] is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive substance, but unlike many others, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.<ref name="demon drink">{{cite journal | last = Lovett | first = Richard | title = Coffee: The demon drink? | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2518|date = 24 September 2005 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700 | accessdate=2007-11-19 | format=fee required }}</ref>

Psychoactive drugs are divided into different groups according to their pharmacological effects. Commonly used psychoactive drugs and groups:
* [[Anxiolytics]]
::Examples: [[Alcoholic beverages]] (ethanol)
* [[Euphoriants]]
::Examples: [[Alcoholic beverages]] (ethanol)
* [[Hypnotics]]/[[sedatives]]
::Examples: [[Alcoholic beverages]] (ethanol)
* [[Stimulant]]s ("uppers"). This category comprises substances that wake one up, stimulate the mind, and may even cause euphoria, but do not affect perception.
::Examples: [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], [[coca]], [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]], [[phenethylamine]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[guarana]], [[Yerba maté|maté]], [[ephedra]] and [[khat]].
* [[Depressant]]s ("downers"), including [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, and [[narcotic]]s. This category includes all of the calmative, sleep-inducing, anxiety-reducing, anesthetizing substances, which sometimes induce perceptual changes, such as dream images, and also often evoke feelings of euphoria.
::Examples: [[Alcoholic beverages]] (ethanol), [[opioids]], [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]].
* [[Hallucinogen]]s, including [[psychedelics]], [[dissociatives]] and [[deliriants]]. This category encompasses all those substances that produce distinct alterations in perception, sensation of space and time, and emotional states.
::Examples: [[psilocybin]], [[LSD]], ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' and [[nitrous oxide]].

:[[Marijuana]] is an example of a psychoactive drug that combines properties of each of these groups.

=== Use in practice: The theory of dose, set, and setting ===
The theory of dosage, set, and setting is a useful model in dealing with the effects of psychoactive substances, especially in a controlled therapeutic setting as well as in recreational use.  [[Timothy Leary|Dr. Timothy Leary]], based on his own experiences and systematic observations on psychedelics, developed this theory along with his colleagues [[Ralph Metzner]], and [[Richard Alpert]] ([[Ram Dass]]) in the 1960s.<ref>The Psychedelic Experience. New York: University Books. 1964</ref>

;Dosage
The first factor, dosage, has been a truism since ancient times, or at least since [[Paracelsus]] who said, "Dose makes the poison." Some compounds are beneficial or pleasurable when consumed in small amounts, but harmful, deadly, or evoke discomfort in higher doses.

;Set
The set is the internal attitudes and constitution of the person, including their expectations, wishes, and fears. This factor is especially important for the hallucinogens, which have the ability to make conscious experiences out of the unconscious. In traditional cultures, set is shaped primarily by the worldview that all the members of the culture share.

;Setting
The third aspect is setting, which pertains to the surroundings, the place, and the time in which the experiences transpire.

This theory clearly states that the effects are equally the result of chemical, pharmacological, psychological, and physical influences.  The model that Timothy Leary proposed applied to the psychedelics, although it also applies to other psychoactives.<ref name="Psychoactive Plants pg. 10">{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants | publisher=Park Street Press | author=Ratsch, Christian  | authorlink=Christian Rätsch| date=May 5, 2005 | pages=944 | isbn=0-89281-978-2}}</ref>

=== Anesthesia ===
{{Main| Anesthesia}}
[[General anaesthetic|General anesthetics]] are a class of psychoactive drug used on patients to block pain and other sensations. Most anesthetics induce unconsciousness, which allows patients to undergo medical procedures like [[surgery]] without [[physical pain]] or [[emotional trauma]].<ref>Medline Plus. [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/anesthesia.html Anesthesia.] Accessed on July 16, 2007.</ref> To induce unconsciousness, anesthetics affect the [[GABA]] and [[NMDA]] systems. For example, [[halothane]] is a GABA agonist,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li X, Pearce RA |title=Effects of halothane on GABA(A) receptor kinetics: evidence for slowed agonist unbinding |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=899–907 |year=2000 |pmid=10648694 |doi=}}</ref> and [[ketamine]] is an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harrison N, Simmonds M |title=Quantitative studies on some antagonists of N-methyl D-aspartate in slices of rat cerebral cortex |journal=Br J Pharmacol |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=381–91 |year=1985 |pmid=2858237 |pmc=1987274}}</ref>

=== Pain management ===
{{Main| Analgesics}}
Psychoactive drugs are often prescribed to [[pain management|manage pain]]. The subjective experience of pain is primarly regulated by [[endogenous]] [[opioid|opioid peptides]].   Thus,  pain can often be managed using psychoactives that operate on this neurotransmitter system,  also known as [[opioid receptor agonist]]s. This class of drugs can be highly addictive, and includes [[opiate]] [[narcotics]], like [[morphine]] and [[codeine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Quiding H, Lundqvist G, Boréus LO, Bondesson U, Ohrvik J |title=Analgesic effect and plasma concentrations of codeine and morphine after two dose levels of codeine following oral surgery |journal=[[Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol.]] |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=319–23 |year=1993 |pmid=8513842| doi = 10.1007/BF00316466}}</ref> [[NSAID]]s, such as [[aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]], are also analgesics. These agents also reduce [[eicosanoid]]-mediated [[inflammation]] by inhibiting the enzyme [[cyclooxygenase]].

=== Psychiatric medication ===
{{Main| Psychiatric medications}}
[[File:Zoloft bottles.jpg|thumb|250px|Zoloft ([[sertraline]]) is an [[SSRI]] [[antidepressant]].]]

Psychiatric medications are psychoactive drugs prescribed for the management of [[mental disorders|mental and emotional disorders]]. There are six major classes of psychiatric medications:
*[[Antidepressants]], treat disparate disorders such as [[clinical depression]], [[dysthymia]], [[anxiety]], [[eating disorders]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schatzberg|first=AF|year=2000|title=New indications for antidepressants|journal=[[Journal of Clinical Psychiatry]]|volume=61|issue=11|pages=9–17|pmid=10926050|accessdate=2007-11-20}}</ref>
*[[Stimulants]], which are used to treat disorders such as [[attention deficit disorder]] and [[narcolepsy]] and to [[anoretic|suppress the appetite]].
*[[Antipsychotics]], which are used to treat [[psychosis|psychotic symptoms]], such as those associated with [[schizophrenia]] or severe [[mania]].
*[[Mood stabilizers]], which are used to treat [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizoaffective disorder]].
*[[Anxiolytics]], which are used to treat [[anxiety disorder]]s.
*[[Depressants]], which are used as [[hypnotics]], [[sedative]]s, and [[anesthetic]]s, depending upon dosage.

In addition, several psychoactive substances are currently employed to treat dependence on other substances.  These include [[acamprosate]] or [[naltrexone]] in the treatment of alcoholism, or [[methadone]] or [[buprenorphine]] [[Opioid replacement therapy|maintenance therapy]] in the case of [[opioid dependency]].{{fact|date=June 2012}}

Exposure to psychoactive drugs can cause changes to the brain that counteract their effects, making their effects temporary and leading to [[physical dependence]] (see Effects, below).

===Recreational use===
{{Main| Recreational drug use}}
Many psychoactive substances are used for their mood and perception altering effects, including those with accepted uses in medicine and psychiatry. Examples include [[caffeine]], [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[LSD]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name="who">[http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/en/Neuroscience_E.pdf Neuroscience of Psychoactive Substance Use and Dependence] by the [[World Health Organization]]. Retrieved 5 July 2007.</ref> Classes of drugs frequently used recreationally include:
*[[Stimulants]], which activate the [[central nervous system]]. These are used recreationally for their [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] effects.
*[[Hallucinogens]] ([[psychedelics]], [[dissociatives]] and [[deliriants]]), which induce perceptual and cognitive distortions.
*[[Hypnotics]], which depress the central nervous system. These are used recreationally because of their euphoric effects.
*[[Opioid|Opioid analgesics]], which also depress the central nervous system. These are used recreationally because of their euphoric effects.
*[[Inhalant]]s, in the forms of gas aerosols, or solvents, which are inhaled as a vapor because of their stupefying effects. Many inhalants also fall into the above categories (such as [[nitrous oxide]] which is also an analgesic).

In some modern and ancient cultures, drug usage is seen as a [[Social status|status]] symbol. Recreational drugs are seen as status symbols in settings such as at [[nightclub]]s and parties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson TL |title=Drug identity change processes, race, and gender. III. Macrolevel opportunity concepts |journal=Substance Use & Misuse |volume=33 |issue=14 |pages=2721–35 |year=1998 |pmid=9869440 |doi=10.3109/10826089809059347}}</ref> For example, in [[ancient Egypt]], gods were commonly pictured holding hallucinogenic plants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bertol E, Fineschi V, Karch S, Mari F, Riezzo I |title=Nymphaea cults in ancient Egypt and the New World: a lesson in empirical pharmacology |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=84–5 |year=2004 |pmid=14749409 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.97.2.84 |pmc=1079300}}</ref>

Because there is controversy about regulation of recreational drugs, there is an [[arguments for and against drug prohibition|ongoing debate about drug prohibition]]. Critics of prohibition believe that regulation of recreational drug use is a violation of personal autonomy and [[liberty|freedom]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayry M |title=Prescribing cannabis: freedom, autonomy, and values |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=333–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15289511| doi = 10.1136/jme.2002.001347 |pmc=1733898}}</ref> In the United States, critics have noted that prohibition or regulation of recreational and spiritual drug use might be [[unconstitutional]].<ref>Barnett, Randy E. [http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/22/p29Barnett.pdf "The Presumption of Liberty and the Public Interest: Medical Marijuana and Fundamental Rights"]. Retrieved 4 July 2007.</ref>

===Ritual and spiritual use===
[[File:Timothy-Leary-Los-Angeles-1989.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Timothy Leary]] was a leading proponent of spiritual hallucinogen use.]]
{{Main| Entheogens}}
Certain psychoactives, particularly hallucinogens, have been used for religious purposes since prehistoric times. Native Americans have used [[peyote]] cacti containing [[mescaline]] for religious ceremonies for as long as 5700 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=El-Seedi HR, De Smet PA, Beck O, Possnert G, Bruhn JG |title=Prehistoric peyote use: alkaloid analysis and radiocarbon dating of archaeological specimens of Lophophora from Texas |journal=[[Journal of Ethnopharmacology]] |volume=101 |issue=1-3 |pages=238–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15990261 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2005.04.022}}</ref> The [[muscimol]]-containing [[Amanita muscaria]] mushroom was used for ritual purposes throughout prehistoric Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Jerzy Vetulani|Vetulani J]] |title=Drug addiction.

[http://www.nerdshit.com/wordpress/?p=1433 Entheogens and the Origins of Religion]. Retrieved on May 13, 2007.</ref>

The use of entheogens for religious purposes resurfaced in the West during the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movements]] of the 1960s and 70s. Under the leadership of [[Timothy Leary]], new religious movements began to use [[LSD]] and other hallucinogens as [[sacrament]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Becker HS |title=History, culture and subjective experience: an exploration of the social bases of drug-induced experiences |journal=Journal of health and social behavior |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=163–76 |year=1967 |pmid=6073200| doi = 10.2307/2948371 |publisher=American Sociological Association |jstor=2948371}}</ref> In the United States, the use of peyote for ritual purposes is protected only for members of the [[Native American Church]], which is allowed to cultivate and distribute [[peyote]]. However, the genuine religious use of Peyote, regardless of one's personal ancestry, is protected in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Oregon.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bullis RK |title=Swallowing the scroll: legal implications of the recent Supreme Court peyote cases |journal=[[Journal of Psychoactive Drugs]] |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=325–32 |year=1990 |pmid=2286866 |doi=}}</ref>

=== Military ===
{{Main|Psychochemical weapons}}
Psychoactive drugs have been used in military applications as [[non-lethal weapon]]s. In World War II, between 1939 and 1945, 60 million [[amphetamine]] pills were made for use by soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Brown-brown]], a form of cocaine adulterated with gunpowder, has been used in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] by child soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Both military and civilian American intelligence officials are known to have used psychoactive drugs while interrogating captives apprehended in its [[War on Terror]].
In July 2012, [[Jason Leopold]] and Jeffrey Kaye, psychologists and human rights workers, had a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request fulfilled that confirmed that the use of psychoactive drugs during interrogation was a long-standing

In May 2003, recently released [[Pakistani captives in Guantanamo|Pakistani captive]] [[Sha Mohammed Alikhel]] described the routine use of psychoactive drugs. He said that [[Jihan Wali]], a captive kept in a nearby cell, was rendered catatonic through the use of these drugs.

== Administration ==
For a substance to be psychoactive, it must cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] so it can affect neurochemical function. Psychoactive drugs are [[Route of administration|administered]] in several different ways. In medicine, most psychiatric drugs, such as [[fluoxetine]], [[quetiapine]], and [[lorazepam]] are [[ingest]]ed orally in [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] or [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] form. However, certain medical psychoactives are administered via [[inhalation]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], or rectal [[suppository]]/[[enema]]. Recreational drugs can be administered in several additional ways that are not common in medicine. Certain drugs, such as [[grain alcohol|alcohol]] and [[caffeine]], are ingested in beverage form; [[nicotine]] and [[cannabis]] are often [[Smoking|smoked]]; [[peyote]] and [[psilocybin mushrooms]] are ingested in botanical form or dried; and certain crystalline drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamines]] are often [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] (inhaled or "snorted"). The efficiency of each method of administration varies from drug to drug.<ref>United States Food and Drug Administration. [http://www.fda.gov/cder/dsm/DRG/drg00301.htm CDER Data Standards Manual]. Retrieved on May 15, 2007.</ref>

== Effects ==
[[File:Synapse Illustration2 tweaked.svg|thumb|right|300px|Illustration of the major elements of [[neurotransmission]]. Depending on its method of action, a psychoactive substance may block the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron ([[dendrite]]), or block reuptake or affect neurotransmitter synthesis in the pre-synaptic neuron ([[axon]]).]]
{{Main| Neuropsychopharmacology}}
Psychoactive drugs operate by temporarily affecting a person's neurochemistry, which in turn causes changes in a person's mood, cognition, perception and behavior. There are many ways in which psychoactive drugs can affect the brain. Each drug has a specific action on one or more [[neurotransmitter]] or [[neuroreceptor]] in the brain.

Drugs that increase activity in particular neurotransmitter systems are called [[agonists]]. They act by increasing the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of one or more neurotransmitters or reducing its [[reuptake]] from the [[synapses]]. Drugs that reduce neurotransmitter activity are called [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]], and operate by interfering with synthesis or blocking postsynaptic receptors so that neurotransmitters cannot bind to them.<ref>{{cite book| last = Seligma| first = Martin E.P.| title = Abnormal Psychology| publisher = W.

Exposure to a psychoactive substance can cause changes in the structure and functioning of [[neurons]], as the nervous system tries to re-establish the [[homeostasis]] disrupted by the presence of the drug (see also, [[Neuroplasticity]]). Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter increases the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter, and the receptors themselves become more sensitive. This is called [[sensitization]]. Conversely, overstimulation of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter causes a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors, a process called [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] or [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]]. Sensitization and desensitization are more likely to occur with long-term exposure, although they may occur after only a single exposure. These processes are thought to underlie dependence and addiction.<ref>{{cite web | title=University of Texas, Addiction Science Research and Education Center | url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/asrec/dopamine.html | accessdate=May 14, 2007}}</ref> [[Physical dependence]] on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety, respectively, as withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, because [[clinical depression]] (also called [[major depressive disorder]]) is often referred to simply as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed, but not clinically depressed.

=== Affected neurotransmitter systems ===
The following is a brief table of notable drugs and their primary neurotransmitter, receptor or method of action. It should be noted that many drugs act on more than one transmitter or receptor in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lüscher C, Ungless M |title=The mechanistic classification of addictive drugs |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e437 |year=2006 |pmid=17105338 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030437 |pmc=1635740}}</ref>

== Addiction ==
{{Main|Substance use disorder}}
[[File:Rational scale to assess the harm of drugs (mean physical harm and mean dependence).svg|thumb| 300px|Comparison of physical harm and dependence of various drugs as estimated by [[The Lancet]].<ref>{{cite pmid|17382831}}</ref>]]

Psychoactive drugs are often associated with addiction. Addiction can be divided into two types: [[Substance dependence|psychological addiction]], by which a user feels compelled to use a drug despite negative physical or societal consequence, and [[physical dependence]], by which a user must use a drug to avoid physically uncomfortable or even medically harmful [[withdrawal]] symptoms.<ref name="johnson">Johnson, Brian. (2002) [http://www.bostonneuropsa.org/PDF%20Files/Johnson.pdf Psychological Addiction, Physical Addiction, Addictive Character, and Addictive Personality Disorder: A Nosology of Addictive Disorders.] Retrieved on July 5, 2007.</ref> Not all drugs are physically addictive, but any activity that stimulates the brain's dopaminergic reward system — typically, any pleasurable activity<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang J, Xu M |title=Toward a molecular understanding of psychostimulant actions using genetically engineered dopamine receptor knockout mice as model systems |journal=J Addict Dis |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=7–18 |year=2001 |pmid=11681595 |doi=10.1300/J069v20n04_02}}</ref> — can lead to psychological addiction.<ref name="johnson" /> Drugs that are most likely to cause addiction are drugs that directly stimulate the dopaminergic system, like [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]]. Drugs that only indirectly stimulate the dopaminergic system, such as [[psychedelics]], are not as likely to be addictive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Many professionals, self-help groups, and businesses specialize in [[drug rehabilitation]], with varying degrees of success, and many parents attempt to influence the actions and choices of their children regarding psychoactives.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hops H, Tildesley E, Lichtenstein E, Ary D, Sherman L |title=Parent-adolescent problem-solving interactions and drug use |journal=The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse |volume=16 |issue=3-4 |pages=239–58 |year=1990 |pmid=2288323| doi = 10.3109/00952999009001586}}</ref>

Common forms of [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] include [[psychotherapy]], [[support groups]] and [[pharmacotherapy]], which uses psychoactive substances to reduce cravings and physiological [[withdrawal]] symptoms while a user is going through detox. [[Methadone]], itself an [[opioid]] and a psychoactive substance, is a common treatment for [[heroin]] addiction,  as is another opioid,[[buprenorphine]]. Recent research on addiction has shown some promise in using [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] such as [[ibogaine]] to treat and even cure [[Substance dependence|addictions]], although this has yet to become a widely accepted practice.<ref name="macpherson">{{cite web | title=Psychedelics Could Treat Addiction Says Vancouver Official | url=http://thetyee.ca/News/2006/08/09/Psychedelics/ | accessdate=March 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name="mojeiko">{{cite web | title=Ibogaine research to treat alcohol and drug addiction | url=http://www.maps.org/ibogaine/ | accessdate=March 26, 2007}}</ref>

== Legality ==

{{main|Prohibition of drugs}}
The legality of psychoactive drugs has been controversial through most of ''recent'' history; the [[Second Opium War]] and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] are two historical examples of legal controversy surrounding psychoactive drugs. However, in recent years, the most influential document regarding the legality of psychoactive drugs is the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], an international [[treaty]] signed in 1961 as an Act of the [[United Nations]]. Signed by 73 nations including the [[United States]], the [[USSR]], [[India]], and the [[United Kingdom]], the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs established Schedules for the legality of each drug and laid out an international agreement to fight addiction to [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] by combatting the sale, trafficking, and use of scheduled drugs.<ref name="UN">[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1961_en.pdf United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.] Retrieved on June 20, 2007.</ref> All countries that signed the treaty passed laws to implement these rules within their borders. However, some countries that signed the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, such as the [[Netherlands]], are more lenient with their enforcement of these laws.<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacCoun R, Reuter P |title=Interpreting Dutch cannabis policy: reasoning by analogy in the legalization debate |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5335 |pages=47–52 |year=1997 |pmid=9311925| doi = 10.1126/science.278.5335.47}}</ref>

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has authority over all drugs, including psychoactive drugs. The FDA regulates which psychoactive drugs are [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] and which are only available with a [[Medical prescription|prescription]].<ref>History of the Food and Drug Administration. Retrieved at [http://www.fda.gov/oc/history/historyoffda/section1.html FDA's website] on June 23, 2007.</ref> However, certain psychoactive drugs, like alcohol, tobacco, and drugs listed in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs are subject to criminal laws.

In the medical context, psychoactive drugs as a treatment for illness is widespread and generally accepted. Little controversy exists concerning [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] psychoactive medications in [[antiemetics]] and [[Cough medicine|antitussives]]. Psychoactive drugs are commonly prescribed to patients with psychiatric disorders. However, certain critics believe that certain prescription psychoactives, such as [[antidepressants]] and [[stimulants]], are overprescribed and threaten patients' judgement and autonomy.<ref>Dworkin, Ronald.
