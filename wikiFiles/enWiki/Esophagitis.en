'''Esophagitis''' (or '''oesophagitis''') is [[inflammation]] of the [[esophagus]]. It may be acute or chronic. Acute esophagitis can be [[catarr]]hal or [[phlegmon]]ous, whereas chronic esophagitis may be hypertrophic or atrophic.

== Symptoms ==

* [[Heartburn]] (pain in chest/abdomen and may radiate to neck/jaw)
* Nausea
* [[Postprandial]] worsening of symptoms
Symptoms may be relieved by [[antacid]]s

== Causes ==

===Infectious===
Forms of infectious esophagitis are typically seen in [[immunocompromised]] people. Types include:

*Fungal
** [[Candida (genus)|Candida]] ([[Esophageal candidiasis]])
* Viral
** [[Herpes simplex]] ([[Herpes esophagitis]])
** [[Cytomegalovirus]]

[[Endoscopy]] can be used to distinguish among these conditions.<ref name="ClassenTytgat2010">{{cite book|first1=Meinhard |last1=Classen|first2=Guido N.

===Other===
* The most common cause is [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD, or GORD in British English). If caused by GERD, the disease is also called '''reflux esophagitis'''.
* Chemical injury by [[alkaline]] or [[acid]] solutions may also cause esophagitis, and is usually seen in children, as well as in adults who attempt [[suicide]] by ingestion of caustic substances<ref>{{cite book

* Physical injury resulting from [[radiation therapy]] or by [[nasogastric tube]]s may also be responsible.
* [[Hyperacidity]].
* [[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]] abuse.
* [[Eosinophilic esophagitis]] is a little understood form of esophagitis, which is thought to be related to [[food allergy|food allergies]].

==Grading of severity==
The severity of esophagitis is commonly classified into four grades according to the ''Los Angeles Classification'':<ref>{{cite web |author=Farivar M. |title=Los Angeles Classification of Esophagitis |publisher=webgerd.com |url=http://www.webgerd.com/LosAngeles.htm}} In turn citing: {{cite journal |author=Lundell LR, Dent J, Bennett JR, ''et al.'' |title=Endoscopic assessment of oesophagitis: clinical and functional correlates and further validation of the Los Angeles classification |journal=Gut |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=172â€“80 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10403727 |pmc=1727604 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10403727}}</ref><ref>Laparoscopic bariatric surgery
