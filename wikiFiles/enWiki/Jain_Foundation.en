The '''Jain Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization]] located in Bellevue, Washington, whose mission is to cure muscular dystrophies caused by [[dysferlin]] protein deficiency. These dystrophies are collectively termed [[dysferlinopathy]], and include [[Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy]] type 2B (LGMD2B) and [[Miyoshi muscular dystrophy]] 1 (MMD1).

The Jain Foundation funds research projects around the world to better understand and develop therapies for this rare disease<ref name="projects">[http://www.jain-foundation.org/our-dysferlin-research-institute/funded-projects  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Our Funded Projects."]</ref> and plays an active role in managing the projects it funds.<ref name="reporting">[http://jain-foundation.org/sites/default/files/forms/Jain%20Foundation%20Funding%20Agreement%20-current.pdf ''Jain Foundation,'' "Reporting Obligations and Sharing Expectations."]</ref> In addition to requiring accountability and transparency, the Jain Foundation encourages the sharing of ideas and resources between research teams in order to maximize efficiency and hasten development of a cure for dysferlinopathy.<ref name="reporting" /> The Jain Foundation also supports diagnosis of dysferlinopathy patients at the genetic level<ref name="diagnosis">[http://www.jain-foundation.org/patient-physician-resources/diagnostic-resources  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Diagnostic Resources."]</ref> to enable a rigorous clinical outcome study to measure the clinical progression of dysferlinopathy.<ref name="mutational">[http://www.jain-foundation.org/dysferlinoutcomestudy  ''Jain Foundation,'' "International Clinical Outcome Study for Dysferlinopathy"]</ref>

==Patient Registry==
A major obstacle in finding a cure for [[dysferlinopathy]] is the scarcity of patients who have been analyzed genetically and confirmed to have mutations in the [[dysferlin]] gene, making it difficult to rigorously characterize the clinical phenotype and progression of dysferlin deficiency, particularly because this disease is so variable.<ref name="nguyen">{{cite journal  | author=Nguyen K, Bassez G, Krahn M, ''et al.'' |title=Phenotypic study in 40 patients with dysferlin gene mutations: high frequency of atypical phenotypes. |journal=Arch Neurol. |volume=64 |issue= 8 |pages= 1176–82 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17698709 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.64.8.1176 }}</ref> The dysferlin gene is large, which increases the difficulty<ref name="nguyen" /><ref name="wicklund">{{cite journal  | author=Wicklund MP and Hilton-Jones D. |title=The limb-girdle muscular dystrophies: Genetic and phenotypic definition of a disputed entity. |journal=Neurology |volume=60 | issue=8 |pages= 1230–1 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12707421 }}</ref> and cost<ref name="diagnosis" /> of dysferlin sequencing. Furthermore, since gene sequencing does not currently affect the clinical management of patients, it is usually not covered by health insurance.<ref name="wicklund" /><ref>[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/medicine/genetest.shtml  ''Human Genome Project Information,'' "Gene Testing."]</ref>

To help address these issues, the Jain Foundation maintains a worldwide registry<ref>[http://www.jain-foundation.org/patient-physician-resources/patient-registration  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Patient Registration."]</ref> for all patients who have been diagnosed with dysferlinopathy, supports genetic diagnosis of qualified patients,<ref name="diagnosis" /> and works to educate physicians on the importance of genetic testing for their patients. The Jain Foundation also recently introduced the LGMD Subtype Prediction Tool, a free online tool to help physicians and clinicians diagnose potential LGMD sub-types.<ref>http://jain-foundation.org/lgmd-subtyping-tool/</ref> A clinical outcome study is beginning in the fall of 2012 <ref>http://www.jain-foundation.org/dysferlinoutcomestudy</ref> will work to define the best tests for measuring disease progression for use in clinical trials<ref name="jain-foundation.org">http://www.jain-foundation.org/dysferlinoutcomestudy/goals</ref> as well as collect accurate details about the full clinical spectrum of the different forms of dysferlinopathy by measuring disease progression.<ref name="jain-foundation.org"/>

==Funded Research Projects==
The Jain Foundation funds basic and translational research that is focused towards understanding and curing dysferlinopathy. The research projects cover a wide range of topics, such as the role of dysferlin in muscle, the pathology of dysferlin deficiency, and approaches to treatment.<ref name="diagnosis" />

==Research Funding Model==
The Jain Foundation funds research using a non-traditional funding model, including:

a)    An in-house, full-time scientific team to review grant proposals and manage funded projects, as opposed to an external scientific advisory committee.<ref>[http://www.jain-foundation.org/about-us/our-team  ''Jain Foundation,'' "About Us."]</ref>

b)    An interactive project management process, including direct input into the aims and design of each project, and close communication with funded researchers.<ref name="reporting" />

c)    Required quarterly updates (in the style of lab meetings) with funded researchers to help them identify and address roadblocks.<ref name="reporting" />

d)    Active efforts to foster collaborations and exchange of resources between funded laboratories.<ref name="reporting" /><ref>[http://sharing.jain-foundation.org/  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Resource Sharing Network."]</ref>

e)    Generation and distribution of research tools and reagents, including DNA constructs,<ref>[http://www.jain-foundation.org/our-dysferlin-research-institute/research-tools/dysferlin-cdna-clones  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Dysferlin cDNAs."]</ref> antibodies, cell lines, and animal models that are essential for many of these research projects.<ref name="projects" /><ref>[http://www.jain-foundation.org/our-dysferlin-research-institute  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Our Dysferlin Research Institute."]</ref>

==Annual Meeting==
The Jain Foundation holds an annual conference for researchers and clinicians studying dysferlin. In the past, this event has been held in Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Boston, and Seattle.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Albrecht DE, Garg N, Rufibach LE, ''et al.'' |title=3rd Annual Dysferlin Conference 2–5 June 2009, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. |journal=Neuromuscul Disord. |volume=19 |issue= 12 |pages= 867–73 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19781937 |doi= 10.1016/j.nmd.2009.08.005 }}</ref> The 2011 conference took place in Chicago on July 11-14th at the DoubleTree Hilton Magnificent Mile.<ref>[http://www.jain-foundation.org/our-dysferlin-research-institute/conferences  ''Jain Foundation,'' "Sponsored Conferences."]</ref>
