'''''Streptococcus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[sphere|spherical]] [[Gram-positive]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] belonging to the [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] [[Firmicutes]]<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | editors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> and the [[lactic acid bacteria]] group.  [[Cell division|Cellular division]] occurs along a single [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in these bacteria, and thus they grow in chains or pairs, hence the name &mdash; from [[Greek language|Greek]] στρεπτος ''streptos'', meaning easily bent or twisted, like a chain (twisted chain). 

Contrast this with [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]], which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.  Most streptococci are [[oxidase]]- and [[catalase]]-negative, and many are [[facultative anaerobes]].

In 1984, many organisms formerly considered ''Streptococcus'' were separated out into the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Enterococcus]]'' and ''[[Lactococcus]]''.<ref name="pmid12364372">{{cite journal |author=Facklam R |title=What happened to the streptococci: overview of taxonomic and nomenclature changes |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=613–30 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12364372 |pmc=126867 |doi= 10.1128/CMR.15.4.613-630.2002|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12364372}}</ref> There are currently >50 species recognised in this genus.

==Pathogenesis and classification==
[[File:Strep Classification.svg|600px|thumb|Streptococcal classification.]]
In addition to [[streptococcal pharyngitis]] (strep throat), certain ''Streptococcus'' species are responsible for many cases of [[conjunctivitis|pink eye]],<ref>http://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm</ref> [[meningitis]], [[bacterial pneumonia]], [[endocarditis]], [[erysipelas]] and [[necrotizing fasciitis]] (the 'flesh-eating' bacterial infections). However, many streptococcal species are nonpathogenic, and form part of the [[Commensalism|commensal]] human [[microbiome]] of the mouth, skin, intestine, and upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, streptococci are a necessary ingredient in producing [[Emmentaler]] ("Swiss") cheese.

Species of ''Streptococcus'' are classified based on their [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|hemolytic]] properties.<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Patterson MJ | title = Streptococcus. ''In:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | id = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.824 (via NCBI Bookshelf)] ISBN 0-9631172-1-1 }}</ref> Alpha hemolytic species cause oxidization of iron in hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells, giving it a greenish color on blood agar. Beta hemolytic species cause complete rupture of red blood cells.  On blood agar, this appears as wide areas clear of blood cells surrounding bacterial colonies. Gamma-hemolytic species cause no hemolysis.

Beta-hemolytic streptococci are further characterised via [[Rebecca Lancefield|Lancefield]] [[Serovar|serotyping]], which describes specific carbohydrates present on the bacterial cell wall.<ref name=Facklam_2002>{{cite journal | author=Facklam R | title=What happened to the streptococci: overview of taxonomic and nomenclature changes | journal=Clin Microbiol Rev | year=2002 | pages=613–30 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pmid=12364372 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.4.613-630.2002 | pmc=126867}}</ref> There are 20 described serotypes, named Lancefield groups A to V (excluding I and J).

In the medical setting, the most important groups are the alpha-hemolytic streptococci ''S. pneumoniae'' and ''Streptococcus'' Viridans-group, and the beta-hemolytic streptococci of Lancefield groups A and B (also known as “Group A strep” and “Group B strep”).

===Alpha-hemolytic===

====Pneumococci====
*''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' (sometimes called ''Pneumococcus''), is a leading cause of bacterial [[pneumonia]] and occasional etiology of [[otitis media]], [[sinusitis]], [[meningitis]] and [[peritonitis]].
Inflammation is thought to be the major cause of how pneumococcus causes disease, hence the tendency of diagnoses associated with it to involve inflammation.

====The Viridans group: alpha-hemolytic====

===Beta-hemolytic ===
[[File:Alpha and Beta haemolytic streptococci.jpg|thumb|250px|Alpha-hemolytic ''[[S. viridans]]'' (right) and beta-hemolytic ''[[S. pyogenes]]'' (left)  streptococci growing on blood agar.]]

==== Group A ====
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes|S. pyogenes]]'', also known as Group A ''Streptococcus'' ('''GAS'''), is the causative agent in a wide range of [[Group A streptococcal infection]]s. These [[infection]]s may be non-invasive or invasive. The non-invasive infections tend to be more common and less severe. The most common of these infections include ''[[streptococcal pharyngitis]]'' (strep throat) and [[impetigo]].<ref name="Cohen-Poradosu 2007">{{cite journal|last=Cohen-Poradosu|first=Ronit|coauthors=Dennis L. Kasper|title=Group A Streptococcus Epidemiology and Vaccine Implications|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2007}}</ref> [[Scarlet fever]] is also a non-invasive [[infection]], but has not been as common in recent years. 
 
The invasive [[infection]]s cause by Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus tend to be more severe and less common. This occurs when the [[bacterium]] is able to infect areas where it is not usually found, such as the [[blood]] and the [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Streptococcal Infections (Invasive Group A Strep)|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cd/cdstrep.shtml|publisher=New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref> The diseases that may be caused as a result of this include streptococcal [[toxic shock syndrome]] (STSS), [[necrotizing fasciitis]] (NF), [[pneumonia]], and [[bacteremia]].<ref name="Cohen-Poradosu 2007"/> 

Additional complications may be caused by GAS, namely acute [[rheumatic fever]] and acute [[glomerulonephritis]]. [[Rheumatic fever]], a disease that affects the [[joints]], [[kidneys]], and [[heart valves]], is a consequence of untreated strep A infection caused not by the bacterium itself. Rheumatic fever is caused by the antibodies created by the immune system to fight off the infection cross-reacting with other proteins in the body. This "cross-reaction" causes the body to essentially attack itself and leads to the damage above. Globally, GAS has been estimated to cause more than 500,000 deaths every year, making it one of the world's leading [[pathogen]]s.<ref name="Cohen-Poradosu 2007"/> Group A ''Streptococcus'' infection is generally diagnosed with a [[Rapid Strep Test]] or by culture.

====Group B ====
''[[Streptococcus agalactiae|S. agalactiae]]'', or '''GBS''', causes [[pneumonia]] and [[meningitis]] in [[neonate]]s and the [[elderly]], with occasional systemic [[bacteremia]]. They can also colonize the intestines and the female reproductive tract, increasing the risk for premature rupture of membranes during pregnancy, and transmission of the organism to the infant. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] recommend that all pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks gestation should be tested for GBS. Women who test positive should be given prophylactic antibiotics during labor, which will usually prevent transmission to the infant.<ref name=Schrag_2002>{{cite journal |author=Schrag S, Gorwitz R, Fultz-Butts K, Schuchat A |title=Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Revised guidelines from CDC |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=51 |issue=RR-11 |pages=1–22 |year=2002 |pmid=12211284}}</ref>  

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], clinicians have been slow to implement the same standards as the [[United States of America|US]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]].  In the UK, only 1% of maternity units test for the presence of Group B ''Streptococcus''.<ref name=RCOG_2003>{{cite journal | author = Hughes, RG, et al. | title = Prevention of Early Onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease | publisher = Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists | url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=520 }}</ref> Although the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued risk-based guidelines in 2003 (due for review 2006), the implementation of these guidelines has been patchy. As a result, over 75 infants in the UK die each year of GBS-related disease, and another 600 or so suffer serious infection, most of which could be prevented;<ref name=GBSS_2007>{{cite web | title = Group B Strep Support Home Page | publisher = Group B Strep Support | date = 2007-01-09 | url = http://www.gbss.org.uk/ }}</ref> however, this is yet to be substantiated by randomized, controlled trial in the UK setting and, given the evidence for the efficacy of testing and treating from other countries, it may be that the large-scale trial necessary would receive neither funding nor ethics approval.<ref name=Arjb1_2007>{{cite web | title = RCOG: Preventing group B streptococcus infection in new born babies | publisher = RCOG | date = 2006-02 | url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1400#national }}</ref>

====Group C ====
This group includes ''S. equi'', which causes [[strangles]] in horses,<ref name=Harrington_2002>{{cite journal |author=Harrington D, Sutcliffe I, Chanter N |title=The molecular basis of Streptococcus equi infection and disease |journal=Microbes Infect |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=501–10 |year=2002 |pmid=11932201 | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(02)01565-4}}</ref> and ''[[Streptococcus zooepidemicus|S. zooepidemicus]]'' - ''S. equi'' is a clonal descendent or biovar of the ancestral ''S. zooepidemicus''  - which causes infections in several species of mammals, including cattle and horses. ''Streptococcus dysgalactiae'' is also a member of Group C, β-haemolytic streptococci that can cause pharyngitis and other pyogenic infections similar to Group A streptococci.

====Group D (enterococci) ====
Many former Group D streptococci have been reclassified and placed in the genus ''[[Enterococcus]]'' (including ''Enterococcus faecalis'', ''Enterococcus faecium'', ''Enterococcus durans'', and ''Enterococcus avium'').<ref name="pmid17400023">{{cite journal |author=Köhler W |title=The present state of species within the genera Streptococcus and Enterococcus |journal=[[International Journal of Medical Microbiology]]|volume=297 |issue=3 |pages=133–50 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17400023 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmm.2006.11.008 |url=}}</ref> For example, ''Streptococcus faecalis'' is now ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]''.

The remaining nonenterococcal Group D strains include ''[[Streptococcus bovis]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus equinus]]''.

Nonhemolytic streptococci rarely cause illness. However, weakly hemolytic group D beta-hemolytic streptococci and ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' (which is actually a Gram-positive bacillus) should not be confused with nonhemolytic streptococci.

====Group F streptococci====
Group F streptococci were first described in 1934 by Long and Bliss amongst the "minute haemolytic streptococci".<ref name=Whitworth_1990>{{cite journal |author=Whitworth JM |title=Lancefield group F and related streptococci |journal=J. Med. Microbiol. |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=135–51 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2250284 |doi=10.1099/00222615-33-3-135 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/33/3/135.long |format=PDF}}</ref> They are also known as ''[[Streptococcus anginosus]]'' (according to the Lancefield classification system) or as members of the [[Streptococcus milleri group|''S. milleri'' group]] (according to the European system).

====Group G streptococci====
These streptococci are usually, but not exclusively, beta-hemolytic. ''Streptococcus canis'' is an example of a GGS which is typically found on animals, but can cause infection in humans.

====Group H streptococci ====
Group H streptococci is a very rare infection caused by the herptitis bacteria found in medium sized canines. Group H streptococci rarely causes illness unless a human has direct contact with the mouth of a canine. One of the most common ways this can be spread is human to canine, mouth-to-mouth contact. However, canine may lick the humans hand and infection can be spread as well.

==Molecular taxonomy==

Streptococci have been divided into six groups on the basis of their 16S rDNA sequences: Anginosus, Bovis, Mitis, Mutans, Pyogenic and Salivarius.<ref name=Kawamura1995>Kawamura Y, Hou XG, Sultana F, Miura H, Ezaki T (1995) Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus ''Streptococcus''. Int J Syst Bacteriol 45: 406–408</ref> The Anginosus group and Mitis group along with ''[[Streptococcus suis]]'' - a species that has not been assigned to any group - appear to form a clade as do the other four groups.<ref name=Shao2013>Shao ZQ, Zhang YM, Pan XZ, Wang B, Chen JQ (2013) Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in ''Streptococcus''. PLoS One 8(3):e60116. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0060116</ref>

The important pathogens ''S. pneumonia'' and ''S. pyogenes'' belong to the Mitis and Pyogenic groups respectively. ''S. agalactiae'' is a basal species in the Pyogenic group.
