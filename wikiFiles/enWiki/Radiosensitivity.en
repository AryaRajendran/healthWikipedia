'''Radiosensitivity''' is the relative susceptibility of cells, tissues, organs or organisms to the harmful effect of [[ionizing radiation]]. Cells are least sensitive when in the [[S phase]], then the [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> phase]], then [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> phase]] and the most sensitive in the [[mitosis|M phase]] of the [[cell cycle]]. This is described by the ''law of [[Jean Bergonié|Bergonié]] and [[Louis Tribondeau|Tribondeau]]'', formulated in 1906:<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Bergonié, J.; Tribondeau, L. | year = 1906 | title = De Quelques Résultats de la Radiotherapie et Essai de Fixation d'une Technique Rationnelle | journal = Comptes-Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences | volume = 143 | pages = 983–985 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal | author = Bergonié, J.; Tribondeau, L. | year = 1959 | title = Interpretation of Some Results of Radiotherapy and an Attempt at Determining a Logical Technique of Treatment / De Quelques Résultats de la Radiotherapie et Essai de Fixation d'une Technique Rationnelle | journal = Radiation Research | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–588  | doi = 10.2307/3570812 }}</ref>

[[X-rays]] are more effective on cells which have a greater reproductive activity.

From their observation, they concluded that quickly dividing [[tumor cell]]s are generally more sensitive than the majority of body cells. This is not always true. Tumor cells can be [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] and therefore less sensitive to X-rays that mediate most of their effects through [[free radical]]s produced by ionizing oxygen.

Later it has been shown that the most sensitive cells are those that are [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]], well nourished, divide quickly and are highly [[metabolism|metabolically]] active. Amongst the body cells, the most sensitive are [[spermatogonium|spermatogonia]] and [[erythroblast]]s, [[Adult stem cell|epidermal stem cell]]s, gastrointestinal stem cells.<ref>O. A.

</ref> The least sensitive are [[nerve cell]]s and [[muscle fiber]]s.

Very sensitive cells are also [[oocyte]]s and [[lymphocyte]]s, although they are [[G0 phase|resting cell]]s and do not meet the criteria described above. The reasons for their sensitivity are not clear.

==Cell damage classification==
The damage of the cell can be ''lethal''' (the cell dies) or ''sublethal'' (the cell can repair itself). The effects on cells can be, according to [[International Commission on Radiological Protection|ICRP]], deterministic and stochastic.

===Deterministic effects===
Deterministic effects have a threshold of irradiation under which they do not appear and are the necessary consequence of irradiation. The damage they cause depends on the dose: they are sublethal from 0,25 to 2 [[Sv]] (a less pronounced form of disease), lethal from 2 to 5 Sv (a certain percent of population dies within 60 days), above 5 Sv the majority of people die within 60 days and above 6 to 7 all people die. Of course, these effect depend also on many other factors, like age, sex, health etc.

===Stochastic effects===
Stochastic effects are coincidental and cannot be avoided. They don't have a threshold. These can be divided into somatic and genetic. Among the '''somatic''' effects, secondary [[cancer]] is the most important. It develops because radiation causes [[DNA]] [[mutation]]s directly and indirectly. Direct effects are those caused by ionizing particles and rays themselves, while the indirect are those that are caused by free radicals, generated especially in [[water]] [[radiolysis]] and [[oxygen]] radiolysis. The '''genetic''' effects confer the predisposition of cancer to the offspring. The process is not well understood.
