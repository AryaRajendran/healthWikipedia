'''Homer Richards Warner''' (April 18, 1922 - November 30, 2012) was an American cardiologist who was an early proponent of [[medical informatics]].<ref name=obit/><ref name="slt">[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/55391911-78/warner-medical-homer-utah.html.csp Father of medical informatics, Utah’s Homer Warner dies], retrieved December 4, 2012</ref> He has pioneered many aspects of computer applications to medicine. Author of the book, ''Computer-Assisted Medical Decision-Making'', published in 1979, he served as CIO for the University’s Health Sciences Center, as president of the [[American College of Medical Informatics]] (where an award has been created in his honor), and was actively involved with the National Institutes of Health.<ref name="uita_hall_of_fame" />He was first chair of the Department of Medical Informatics. University of Utah was the first medical school in the U.S. to formally organize a degree in medical informatics.<ref name="uita_hall_of_fame">[http://www.uita.org/halloffame/homerwarner.htm Hall of Fame of Utah Technology Council, retrieved March 17, 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

Dr. Homer was emeritus chair of the University of Utah's Department of Medical Informatics. He was also a senior member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and president of the American College of Medical Informatics. For over 25 years, Dr. Warner has served almost continuously on research review groups for the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Health Services Research and the National Library of Medicine.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Salt Lake City]] on April 18, 1922 to Homer Warner.<ref name=obit/> He joined the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]] and was trained as a pilot but never saw combat.<ref name=obit/> 

Warner received his [[B.S.]] in 1946 from the [[University of Utah]]. He received his [[M.D.]], also from the [[University of Utah]], in 1949. By 1953 he had worked at [[Parkland Hospital]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] and at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] and had earned a [[Ph.D.]] in physiology from the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref name=obit/>

=== Medical Informatics ===
Beginning in the mid-1950s, Dr. Warner began his work using computers for decision support in cardiology at [http://www.intermouuntainhealthcare.org Intermountain Healthcare] LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. His ground-breaking work set the stage for the growth of the new field of academic study called medical informatics. In the 1970s, Dr. Warner and his Intermountain colleagues created one of the nation’s first versions of an electronic medical record. Designed to assist clinicians in decision-making, Intermountain’s now famous HELP system has been operational for nearly 40 years. 

===University of Utah ===
In 1964, Warner and his associates formally taught computer applications to medicine at the University of Utah in the Department of Biophysics and Bioengineering within the School of Engineering. In 1972, the department was split in two and Warner directed one of the splits: the Department of Medical Biophysics and Computing in the School of Medicine.<ref name="department_utah">[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=61389 department of medical informatics at University of Utah]</ref>

The department is internationally recognized for its contributions to computer applications in clinical care, medical education and research. The mission of the department is to improve health care outcomes through information systems in both the private and public sectors of the health care industry.<ref name="department_utah" />

Much of the department's success is directly attributable to Warner's accomplishments. The department has produced the largest group of medical informatics professionals educated at any institution in the United States.<ref name="department_utah" />

Warner served as director of the cardiovascular laboratory at LDS Hospital from 1954 to 1970 and was honored as Physician of the Year in 1985. 

In 1988, he was elected to senior membership in the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. New members are chosen for major contributions to health and medicine as well as from related fields. 

===Death===
He died on November 30, 2012 in [[Salt Lake City]] from complications of [[pancreatitis]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author=[[Bruce Weber (reporter)|Bruce Weber]] |coauthors= |title= Homer R.

== Intermountain Homer Warner Center for Informatics Research ==
Intermountain Healthcare officially opened a new center to support its clinical information systems on February 16, 2011 on the campus of Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City. Named after Dr. Warner, the [http://intermountainis.org/homer.html Homer Warner Center for Informatics Research] honors one of the industry’s recognized fathers of clinical computer systems.

Advanced information systems help caregivers improve medical delivery and outcomes. For example, these systems automate routine functions, facilitate communication among caregivers, support decision-making processes, and allow statistical analysis to help improve care processes and implement best medical practices.

[http://www.intermountainhealthcare.org Intermountain] has been an industry leader in using computers in the practice of medicine for several decades. Thanks to the hard work and vision of Dr. Homer Warner and his colleagues, Intermountain has an outstanding legacy on which to build all of its future information systems. Beginning in the mid-1950s, Dr. Warner began his work using computers for decision support in cardiology at Intermountain's LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. In the 1970s, Dr. Warner and his Intermountain colleagues created one of the nation’s first versions of an electronic medical record.
