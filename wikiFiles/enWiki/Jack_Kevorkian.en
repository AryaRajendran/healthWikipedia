As an oil painter and a jazz musician, Kevorkian marketed limited quantities of his visual and musical artwork to the public.<!-- lead paragraph, covered later in article-->

==Early life==
Kevorkian was born in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] to [[Armenian people|Armenian]] immigrants. His father Levon was born in the village of [[Pasinler, Erzurum|Passen]], near [[Erzurum]], and his mother Satenig was born in the village of Govdun, near [[Sivas]].<ref name="Kevorkian, Jack 2009">{{cite book| title=glimmerIQs| author=Kevorkian, Jack| publisher=World Audience, Inc.| format=Paperback| year=2009| isbn=978-1-935444-88-6}}</ref> His father moved from Turkey in 1912 and made his way to Pontiac, where he found work at an automobile foundry. Satenig fled the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, finding refuge with relatives in Paris, and eventually reuniting with her brother in Pontiac. Levon and Satenig met through the Armenian community in their city, where they married and began their family. The couple had a daughter, Margaret, in 1926, followed by son Jacob – who later earned the nickname "Jack" from an American teacher who misread the birth certificate<ref name="Nicol 2006">{{cite book|title=Between the Dead and the Dying| last=Nicol| first=Neal| coauthors=Harry Wylie| year=2006| publisher=Satin Publications, Ltd.| location=London| isbn=1-904132-72-3}}</ref> — and, lastly, the third child, Flora.<ref name="papers">{{cite web| url=http://thekevorkianpapers.com/about/biography| title=Biography| author=Kevorkian, Jack| publisher=[http://thekevorkianpapers.com/]| date=December 15, 2010| accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref> <!-- supported in all 3 following citations--> Kevorkian, who taught himself German and Japanese,<ref name="language1">{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-03/jack-kevorkian-assisted-suicide-advocate-dies-at-83.html |title=Jack Kevorkian, Who Assisted Suicides, Dies at 83 |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg |author=Mark Schiofet |date=June 3, 2011}}</ref> graduated from [[Pontiac Central High School]] with honors in 1945, at the age of 17.

==Career==
Over a period of decades, Kevorkian developed several controversial ideas related to death. In a 1959 journal article, he wrote:
{{cquote |I propose that a prisoner condemned to death by due process of law be allowed to submit, by his own free choice, to medical experimentation under complete anaesthesia (at the time appointed for administering the penalty) as a form of execution in lieu of conventional methods prescribed by law.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kevorkian |first=Jack |title=Capital Punishment or Capital Gain |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science |year=1959 |month=May - June |volume=50 |issue=1| pages=50–51}}</ref>}}
Senior doctors at the University of Michigan, Kevorkian's employer, opposed his proposal and Kevorkian chose to leave the University rather than stop advocating his ideas. Ultimately, he gained little support for his plan. He returned to the idea of using death row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' re-instituted the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients, but failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials.<ref name=betzold>{{cite news |last=Betzold |first=Michael |title=1993: Excerpt from 'Appointment with Doctor Death' |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=19 September 1993}}</ref> 

As a [[Pathology|pathologist]] at [[Pontiac General Hospital]], Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients. He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members. Kevorkian thought that the US military might be interested in using this technique to help wounded soldiers during a battle, but the Pentagon was not interested.<ref name=betzold/>

In the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote a series of articles for the German journal ''Medicine and Law'' that laid out his thinking on the ethics of [[euthanasia]].<ref name="Frontline_chronology"/><ref name="Lessenberry1994">{{cite web |title=Death becomes him |publisher=Vanity Fair |author=Lessenberry, Jack |month=July |year=1994 |work=PBS.org |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030806015344/www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.html |archivedate=August 6, 2003 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref>

In 1987, Kevorkian started advertising in [[Detroit]] newspapers as a physician consultant for "death counseling". His first public assisted suicide, of Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old woman diagnosed in 1989 with [[Alzheimer's disease]], took place in 1990. Charges of [[murder]] were dropped on December 13, 1990, as there were, at that time, no laws in Michigan regarding assisted suicide.<ref name="ascension">{{cite web |title=People v. Kevorkian; Hobbins v.

According to his lawyer [[Geoffrey Fieger]], Kevorkian assisted in the deaths of 130 terminally ill people between 1990 and 1998. In each of these cases, the individuals themselves allegedly took the final action which resulted in their own deaths. Kevorkian allegedly assisted only by attaching the individual to a [[euthanasia device]] that he had devised and constructed. The individual then pushed a button which released the drugs or chemicals that would end his or her own life. Two deaths were assisted by means of a device which delivered the euthanizing drugs [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. Kevorkian called the device a "[[Thanatron]]" ("Death machine", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[thanatos]]'' meaning "death").<ref name="thanatron">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/thanatronblurb.html |title=The Kevorkian Verdict: The Thanatron |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date=May 1996 |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref> Other people were assisted by a device which employed a [[gas]] mask fed by a canister of [[carbon monoxide]], which Kevorkian called the "[[Mercitron]]" ("Mercy machine").<ref name="atlantic">{{cite web |title=Jack Kevorkian's Death Van and the Tech of Assisted Suicide |date=June 3, 2011 |first=Nicholas |last=Jackson |publisher=TheAtlantic.com |work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/jack-kevorkians-death-van-and-the-tech-of-assisted-suicide/239897/}}</ref> <!-- moved "this became necessary" claim to Talk -->

According to a report by the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', 60% of the patients who committed suicide with Kevorkian's help were not terminally ill, and at least 13 had not complained of pain. The report further asserted that Kevorkian's counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. (In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's "mental state is ... of paramount importance."<ref name="DFP1">Cheyfitz, Kirk (March 3, 1997). [http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525061/SUICIDE-MACHINE-PART-1 "Suicide Machine, Part 1: Kevorkian rushes to fulfill his clients' desire to die"]. ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''. Archived May 26, 2007.</ref>) The report also stated that Kevorkian failed to refer at least 17 patients to a pain specialist after they complained of chronic pain, and sometimes failed to obtain a complete medical record for his patients, with at least three autopsies of suicides Kevorkian had assisted with showing the person who committed suicide to have no physical sign of disease. Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian's and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian's first patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he "made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life," as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian's activity.<ref name="DFP1"/>  According to ''[[The Economist]]'': "Studies of those who sought out Dr. Kevorkian, however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness ... it was not usually terminal. Autopsies showed five people had no disease at all. ... Little over a third were in pain. Some presumably suffered from no more than hypochondria or depression."<ref name="economist">{{cite news| url= http://www.economist.com/node/18802492 |title=Jack Kevorkian, champion of voluntary euthanasia, died on June 3rd, aged 83| work=The Economist|date=June 9, 2011 |publisher=webCitation.org| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zijIM3U0 |archivedate=June 26, 2011}}</ref>

In response, Kevorkian's attorney Geoffrey Fieger published an essay stating, "I've never met any doctor who lived by such exacting guidelines as Kevorkian ... he published them in an article for the [[American Journal of Forensic Psychiatry]] in 1992. Last year he got a committee of doctors, the Physicians of Mercy, to lay down new guidelines, which he scrupulously follows."<ref name="DFP1"/> However, Fieger stated that Kevorkian found it difficult to follow his "exacting guidelines" due to "persecution and prosecution", adding "[H]e's proposed these guidelines saying this is what ought to be done. These are not to be done in times of war, and we're at war."<ref name="DFP1"/>

In a 2010 interview with [[Sanjay Gupta]], Kevorkian stated an objection to the status of assisted suicide in [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Oregon]], [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|Washington]], and [[Baxter v. Montana|Montana]]. Only in those three states is assisted suicide legal in the United States, and then only for terminally ill patients. To Gupta, Kevorkian stated, "What difference does it make if someone is terminal? We are all terminal."<ref name="regrets">{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/14/kevorkian.gupta/index.html| title=Kevorian: "I have no regrets"|publisher=CNN|date=June 14, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref> In his view, a patient did not have to be terminally ill to be assisted in committing suicide, but did need to be suffering. However, he also said in that same interview that he declined four out of every five assisted suicide requests, on the grounds that the patient needed more treatment or medical records had to be checked.<ref name="GuptaInterview">{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/health/2011/06/03/bts.2010.gupta.kevorkian.cnn| title='Dr. Death's' view on life|publisher=CNN| date=June 14, 2010| accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

===Art career===
Kevorkian was a [[jazz musician]] and [[composer]]. ''[[A Very Still Life|The Kevorkian Suite: A Very Still Life]]'' was a 1997 limited release CD of 5,000 copies from the 'Lucid Subjazz' label. It features Kevorkian on the [[flute]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] playing his own works with "The Morpheus Quintet". It was reviewed in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' online as "weird" but "good natured".<ref name="Essex">Essex, Andrew (December 26, 1997).

He was also an oil painter. His work tended toward the grotesque and [[macabre]]; he sometimes painted with his own blood, and had created pictures such as one "of a child eating the flesh off a decomposing corpse."<ref name="Lessenberry1994"/> Of his known works, six were made available in the 1990s for print release.

==Trials==
Kevorkian was tried four times for assisting suicides between May 1994 to June 1997. With the assistance of Fieger, Kevorkian was acquitted three times.

==Conviction and imprisonment==
{{Euthanasia}}
On the November 22, 1998, broadcast of [[CBS News]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Kevorkian allowed the airing of a videotape he made on September 17, 1998, which depicted the [[voluntary euthanasia]] of Thomas Youk, 52, who was in the final stages of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. After Youk provided his fully [[informed consent]] (a sometimes complex legal determination made in this case by editorial consensus) on September 17, 1998, Kevorkian himself administered Thomas Youk a lethal injection. This was highly significant, as all of his earlier clients had reportedly completed the process themselves. During the videotape, Kevorkian dared the authorities to try to convict him or stop him from carrying out mercy killings. Youk's family described the lethal injection as humane, not murder.

On March 26, 1999, Kevorkian was charged with second-degree [[murder]] and the delivery of a [[controlled substance]] (administering the lethal injection to Thomas Youk).<ref name="Frontline_chronology">{{cite episode| url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/chronology.html |title=The Kevorian Verdict: A Chronology| series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| date=May 1996| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref> Because Kevorkian's [[medical license|license to practice medicine]] had been revoked eight years previously, he was not legally allowed to possess the controlled substance. As homicide law is relatively fixed and routine, this trial was markedly different from earlier ones that involved an area of law in flux (assisted suicide). Kevorkian discharged his attorneys and proceeded through the trial [[pro se|representing himself]], a decision he later regretted.<ref name=Schneider/> The judge ordered a criminal defense attorney to remain available at trial as [[standby counsel]] for information and advice. Inexperienced in law but persisting in his efforts to represent himself, Kevorkian encountered great difficulty in presenting his evidence and arguments. He was not able to call any witnesses to the stand as the judge did not deem the testimony of any of his witnesses relevant.<ref name="Ucolo">{{Cite document| publisher=71 U. Colo. L. Rev.| page=789| title=Pro Se Criminal Defendant, Standby Counsel, and the Judge: A Proposal for Better-Defined Roles, The| author=Williams, Marie Higgins| url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/ucollr71&section=34| year=2000}}</ref>

After a two day trial, the Michigan jury found Kevorkian guilty of second-degree homicide.<ref name=Schneider/> Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced Kevorkian to serve 10–25 years in prison and told him: <blockquote>''"This is a court of law and you said you invited yourself here to take a final stand. But this trial was not an opportunity for a referendum. The law prohibiting euthanasia was specifically reviewed and clarified by the Michigan Supreme Court several years ago in a decision involving your very own cases, sir. So the charge here should come as no surprise to you. You invited yourself to the wrong forum. Well, we are a nation of laws, and we are a nation that tolerates differences of opinion because we have a civilized and a nonviolent way of resolving our conflicts that weighs the law and adheres to the law. We have the means and the methods to protest the laws with which we disagree. You can criticize the law, you can write or lecture about the law, you can speak to the media or petition the voters."'' </blockquote> Kevorkian was sent to a prison in [[Coldwater, Michigan]] to serve his sentence.<ref name="NYTstatement">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/14/us/statement-from-judge-to-kevorkian.html| title=Statement from Judge to Kevorkian| author=Jessica Cooper| work=The New York Times|work=The New York Times| date=April 14, 1999}}</ref> After his conviction (and subsequent losses on appeal) Kevorkian was denied parole repeatedly until 2007.<ref name="Detnews">{{cite news|last=Egan|first=Paul|date=December 14, 2006| url=http://detnews.com/article/20061214/METRO/612140443/After-8-years--Kevorkian-to-go-free| title=After 8 years, Kevorkian to go free| work=[[The Detroit News]]| publisher=Detnews.com| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref>

In an [[MSNBC]] interview aired on September 29, 2005, Kevorkian said that if he were granted parole, he would not resume directly helping people die and would restrict himself to campaigning to have the law changed.

==Legacy==
Maria Silveira, a professor of internal medicine, said she became involved with palliative care partly because of the attention Kevorkian brought to the complex issue of unintended suffering, adding that he had a tremendous impact and fueled the public awareness of unintended suffering and the need to address it. [[Geoffrey Fieger]], Kevorkian's lawyer during the 1990s, gave a speech at a press conference in which he stated,  "Dr. Jack Kevorkian didn’t seek out history, but he made history." <ref name="legacy1"/> Fieger said that Kevorkian revolutionized the concept of suicide by working to help people end their own suffering, because he believed physicians are responsible for alleviating the suffering of patients, even if that meant allowing patients to die.<ref name="legacy1"/> John Finn, medical director of palliative care at the Catholic<ref name="stjohn">{{cite web |url= http://www.stjohnprovidence.org/aboutsjh/mission/ |title=Mission and Values, St. John Health, as a Catholic health ministry |work=stjohnprovidence.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> St. John’s Hospital, said Kevorkian's methods were unorthodox and inappropriate. He added that many of Kevorkian’s patients were isolated, lonely and potentially depressed and therefore in no state to mindfully choose whether to live or die.<ref name="legacy1" />  [[Derek Humphry]], author of the suicide handbook, ''[[Final Exit]]'', said Kevorkian was "too obsessed, too fanatical, in his interest in death and suicide to offer direction for the nation."<ref name="SparkedDebate">{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110604/NEWS05/106040427 | title=Jack Kevorkian sparked a debate on death| date=June 4, 2011| work=Detroit Free Press| accessdate=February 13, 2012| publisher=Freep.com| author=Joe Swickard, Patricia Anstett and L.L.
