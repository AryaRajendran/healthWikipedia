'''MIRA ([[Minimally invasive#Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally Invasive]] Reconstructive [[Angiography]]''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] and [[:wikt:complementary|complementary]] method for treating many [[chronic diseases]]. The MIRA Procedure is a result of combining efforts from different medical fields developed in the [[University of Chicago]] in 1992. It basically consists in [[Medical grafting|medically grafting]] live rejuvenated [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in the form of [[autologous]] [[adipose]] [[adult stem cells]] to a damaged organ in order to restore it and improve its function. This method is currently approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

==History==
The MIRA Procedure originated as a result of combining medical innovations and was developed as a multidisciplinary technique for applications in a wide range of medical fields. In other words this procedure was not developed for a specific application, it is a compilation from data and experience retrieved through years of research as well as practice that have been put together to create a new alternative to treat many diseases and other applications.

In 1989 Dr. [[Christoph Broelsch]] performed the first successful [[living donor liver transplantation]] in the University of Chicago.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Millis JM, Cronin DC, Brady LM, ''et al.''|pmc=1421114 |title=Primary Living-Donor Liver Transplantation at the University of Chicago |publisher=|date= |pmid=10862202 |volume=232 |issue=1 |year=2000 |month=July |journal=Ann.

This procedure has also sparked some controversial and legal issues for enticing [[organ trafficking]] and its practice is currently restricted in some countries.

In 1992, at the University of Chicago Dr. [[Fushih Pan]] is amongst the first to attempt repairing damaged organ tissue by [[tissue grafting]], but with little success due to technological limitations for keeping the grafted tissue live and functional. Dr. Fushih Pan later becomes much more involved in the steps that followed in order to develop the MIRA procedure.

In 1995, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] caught the first glimpse of [[regenerative medicine]] after successfully regenerating [[cranial bone]].<ref>Properties of Coralline Hydroxyapatitie and Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene Membrane in the Immature Craniofacial Skeleton, B.

In 1998 Dr. J. Peter Rubin from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] developed a basic science research program in the biology of adipose derived stem cells and serves as co-director of the Adipose [[Stem Cell]] Center at the University of Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/people/bios/RubinJP1.asp |title=J.

In the year 2002 the [[UCLA]] under direction of Dr. Marc H. Hedrick M.D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.forbes.com/profile/marc-h-hedrick/24963 |title=Marc H. Hedrick Profile - Forbes.com |publisher=People.forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> started research on possible applications of [[Adult stem cells]] generating positive results.<ref>http://patriciazuk.com/rebararticles/tepaper.pdf</ref>

Opting for research on [[Adult stem cells]] rather than [[Embryonic stem cells]] resulted amidst the [[stem cell controversy]] that involve diverse ethical concerns and [[religious groups]], most prominently the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Embryonic stem cell]]s till this day are frowned upon many for the implication of the destruction of [[human embryo]]s, yet the progress of adult stem cells has produced more promising results.

After the introduction of the subject of stem cells into the mainstream it was of utmost importance to keep the public aware of the difference of [[Embryonic Stem Cells]] and Adult stem cells. To help clarify the matter, in 2006 the [[Pope]] of the Catholic Church openly stated the encouragement on research on Adult stem cells.<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0605317.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref><ref>http://www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/bioethic/bishopsESCRstmt.pdf</ref>

In 2008, after years of research the University of Pittsburgh and the UCLA come together sharing their progress in order to the develop a viable stem cell treatment.

Dr. Kotaro Yoshimura was one of the first to implement an alternative to [[breast augmentation]] by safely grafting fat [[stem cells]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmetic-medicine.jp/english/jusin/yk.html |title=Web Master -Cosmetic Medicine in Japan |publisher=Cosmetic-medicine.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cosmetic-medicine.jp/new/Fat%20used%20to%20boost%20breasts.htm |title=news@nature.com - Fat used to boost breasts |doi=10.1038/news040202-19 |publisher=Cosmetic-medicine.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref><ref>http://www.cosmetic-medicine.jp/english/new/Stem%20Cells%20and%20Breast%20Surgery.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/524629/ |title=Stem Cells from Fat Tissue Demonstrate Early Success in Reconstructive Surgery |publisher=Newswise.com |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> In 2009 at the [[University of Tokyo]] he was able to determine the adequate pressure for grafting ADSC more effectively, paving the road to diverse applications for the future. After this breakthrough the engraftment rate was improved even further thanks to the development of a nanoscale shielding using [[biomaterials]] approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). With this, Dr. Fushih Pan was able to successfully develop a safe and reliable medical procedure now known as the MIRA Procedure.

The concept of the MIRA procedure can be considered more off as a [[minimally invasive]] [[tissue graft]] which function restoring capabilities work under the principles of Adult stem cells. The treatments potential use lies in improving patients with chronic diseases such as heart and [[liver failure]] as well as those with neurodegenerative diseases like [[Alzheimer]] and [[MSC]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}. In 2010, the MIRA procedure spawned highly efficient alternatives to some operations in the field of cosmetics. The MIRA Lift is now an alternative for a [[face lift]] that rejuvenates the face's skin cells in order to produce more [[collagen]] for better and more natural results. Currently an alternative for [[breast augmentation]] surgery is also being implemented. All this is done in a [[minimally invasive]] way that involves almost no [[downtime]] to the patient.

==Clinical procedure (simplified)==
The MIRA procedure consists of the following steps:

#Harvest the resting [[progenitor cells]]- [[Bone marrow]] and/or [[adipose tissue]] are collected through [[liposuction]] by a [[reconstructive surgeon]] which are then harvested by a MIRA specialist.
#Activate them intro-operatively- The [[cell (biology)|cell]]s capable of restoration are usually in a resting state. Through a proprietary method, these cells are awakened and activated into their growth stage. This allows the cells to replicate themselves and eventually increase the number of the arm force.
#Package the activated cells with a protective shield- Activated [[progenitor cells]] are very fragile after being harvested and manipulated, making their engraftment rate less than 10%. Therefore, experts on the field developed a porous nanoscale shielding using [[biomaterials]] that are FDA approved that drastically increases engraftment rate and improve the results of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] function.
#Delivery to the damaged tissue- Lastly, all of the packages are delivered to the nearest location to the injured site of the organ using a high-resolution [[angiogram]] operated by a high-skilled [[reconstructive surgeon]] for approaching, identifying, and isolating the feeder [[arterioles]]. This step is further assisted by an interventional [[radiologist]] for a more precise application.
* The MIRA Lift, alternative to a facelift, is combined with [[photorejuvenation]] for optimal results. The treatment of choice typically being Thermage.

==Applications ==
The MIRA Procedure has numerous applications for different fields and many more are still in development:

Clinical applications

* [[Ischemic]] Incidence

:* [[Heart disease]], [[Kidney disease]], [[Brain damage]], [[Muscle]] damage
*  [[Fibrosis]]

:* [[Liver Cirrhosis]], [[Pulmonary Fibrosis]]
* Growth impairment

:* [[Epiphyseal plate]]
*  [[Degeneration]]

:* [[Neurological]]
::*[[Parkinson's]], [[Multiple Sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer]] , [[Retina]] damage
:* [[Integument]]
::* [[Osteoarthritis]], certain types of [[skin diseases]]
*  [[Cancer]]

:* [[Prostate Cancer]]
:* [[Pancreatic ductal carcinoma]]

[[Beauty|Cosmetic]] applications

* [[Facial rejuvenation]]
* [[Breast Augmentation]]
* [[Alopecia]] or hair loss<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recoverup.com/en/hair-regeneration-news/hair-regeneration-news05.html |title=Stem Cell Hair Regeneration News |publisher=Recoverup |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref>

==Advantages ==
Medical field:

* Unlike [[organ transplants]], patients who opt for the MIRA Procedure do not rely on availability of a compatible [[Organ donation|donor]] for operation.
* The procedure, as it names indicate, is [[minimally invasive]] therefore is the safest and most reliable alternative up to date.
* There is minimal [[downtime]] after the procedure and the cost is much more affordable to the patients.
* If necessary, the patient can decide to repeat the procedure for further improvement on his or her condition.
* No risk of [[scarring]].

Cosmetic field:

* More natural appearance after the procedure compared to surgical alternatives.
* Removes [[Skin whitening#Melanin and pigmentation|uneven pigmentation]] and reduces the appearance of [[scars]].
* No risk of [[scarring]].

==Limitations or complications ==
Patients who are not physically adequate to undergo a [[liposuction]] may not be subject for a MIRA procedure.

A drawback for the breast augmentation surgery is that it only provides half the extra volume when compared to current [[Breast implant|implant]]s.

==Future ==
Currently the MIRA Procedure is most well known as an alternative to [[cosmetic surgery]] but has proved to be successful in restoring health to patients with chronic heart disease and cirrhotic liver. Soon enough further research will be employed to develop an adequate treatment for certain types of [[cancer]] as well as neuro-degenerative diseases with more efficacy.

The MIRA Procedure has proven to be a significant alternative to Embryonic Stem Cell treatments which still are under development. The procedure also has some advantages over Embryonic Stem Cell treatments due to its simplicity and therefore its financial cost.
