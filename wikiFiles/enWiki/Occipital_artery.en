The '''occipital artery''' arises from the [[external carotid artery]] opposite the [[facial artery]], its path is below the posterior belly of [[digastric]] to the [[occiput|occipital]] region. This artery supplies blood to the back of the scalp and [[sterno-mastoid]] muscles. Other muscles it supplies are deep muscles in the back and neck.

==Course and Relations==
At its origin, it is covered by the posterior belly of the [[digastricus]] and the [[stylohyoideus]], and the [[hypoglossal nerve]] winds around it from behind forward; higher up, it crosses the [[internal carotid artery]], the [[internal jugular vein]], and the [[vagus]] and [[accessory nerve]]s. 

It next ascends to the interval between the transverse process of the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] and the [[mastoid process]] of the [[temporal bone]], and passes horizontally backward, grooving the surface of the latter bone, being covered by the [[sternocleidomastoideus]], [[splenius capitis]], [[longissimus capitis]], and [[digastricus]], and resting upon the [[rectus capitis lateralis]], the [[obliquus superior]], and [[semispinalis capitis]]. 

It then changes its course and runs vertically upward, pierces the fascia connecting the cranial attachment of the [[trapezius]] with the [[sternocleidomastoideus]], and ascends in a tortuous course in the superficial fascia of the scalp, where it divides into numerous branches, which reach as high as the [[vertex (anatomy)|vertex of the skull]] and [[anastomose]] with the [[posterior auricular artery|posterior auricular]] and [[superficial temporal]] arteries. 

===Branches===
# [[Sternocleidomastoid branches of occipital artery|Sternocleidomastoid branches]]: They are two in number and are given off in the [[carotid triangle]]. The upper branch accompanies the accessory nerve, and the lower branch arises near the origin of the occipital artery.
# [[Auricular branch of occipital artery|Auricular branch]]
# [[Mastoid branch of occipital artery|Mastoid branch]]
# [[Descending branch of occipital artery|Descending branches]]
# [[Occipital branches of occipital artery|Occipital branches]]

Its terminal portion is accompanied by the [[greater occipital nerve]].
