'''Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma''' ('''FHCC''') is a rare form of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] that typically affects young adults and is characterized, under the [[microscope]], by laminated [[fibrous]] layers interspersed between the tumour cells.  Approximately 200 new cases are diagnosed worldwide each year.

==Diagnosis==
Due to lack of symptoms, until the tumor is sizable, this form of [[cancer]] is often advanced when diagnosed.  Local symptoms may include a palpable [[liver]] mass.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Yen | first1 = JB. | last2 = Chang | first2 = KW. | title = Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma- report of a case. | journal = Chang Gung Med J | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 336–9 | month =  | year =  | doi =  | PMID = 19527614 }}</ref>

FHCC often does not produce [[alpha fetoprotein]] (AFP), a widely used marker for conventional [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]. However, FHCC is associated elevated [[neurotensin]] levels. 

==Epidemiology==
FHCC has a low age of onset (~27 years<ref name="pmid16475212">{{cite journal |author=Stipa F, Yoon SS, Liau KH, ''et al.'' |title=Outcome of patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma |journal=Cancer |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1331–8 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16475212 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21703}}</ref>) when compared to conventional HCC.  Also, unlike conventional HCC, patients most often do not have coexistent liver disease.

FHCC generally occurs in young adults without underlying [[cirrhosis]]. Compared to conventional HCC, FHCC grows slowly and has better prognosis, probably owing to its high resectability. 

==Pathology==
The histopathology of FHCC is characterized by laminated fibrous layers, interspersed between the tumor cells.  [[Cytopathology|Cytologically]], the tumor cells have a low [[NC ratio|nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio]] with abundant [[eosin|eosinophilic]] [[cytoplasm]].  Tumors are non-encapsulated, but well circumscribed, when compared to conventional HCC (which typically has an invasive border). 

==Treatment==
In FHCC, plasma [[neurotensin]] and serum [[vitamin B12]] binding globulin are commonly increased and are useful in monitoring the disease and detecting recurrence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

FHCC has a high [[resectability rate]], i.e. it can often be surgically removed.  While liver resection is the optimal treatment and performed repeatedly if possible. Fibrolamellar has a very high recurrence rate. Therefore, periodic follow-up [[medical imaging]] (CT or MRI) is necessary. 

As the tumor is quite rare, there is no standard [[chemotherapy]] regimen. 

The survival rate for fibrolamellar HCC largely depends on whether (and to what degree) the cancer has [[metastasis|metastasized]], i.e. spread to the [[lymph node]]s or other organs. Distant spread (metastases), significantly reduces the median survival rate.
