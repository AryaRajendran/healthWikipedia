In medicine, the '''poppy seed test''' is a [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic test]] used before surgery to predict if surgery will find a [[colovesical fistula]] (an abnormal direct pathway between the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[urinary bladder]]) or other type of [[vesicointestinal fistula]].

The test is very simple.  The patient eats some [[poppy seed]]s, then the patient's [[urine]] is collected in a cup.  If a poppy seed is found in the urine, the patient has a colovesical or related fistula.<ref>{{cite book

The test is very accurate.  In a series of 49 patients who underwent surgery for colovesical fistula due to [[Diverticulitis|sigmoid diverticulitis]], the poppy seed test gave a correct diagnosis more often than abdominopelvic computerized tomography, magnetic resonance tomography of the abdomen, cystogram, retrograde colonic enema, urethrocystoscopy, and colonoscopy.<ref name="pmid19616793">{{cite journal

The test is very inexpensive.  In the United States it has been reported to cost under 6 dollars and two [[orders of magnitude]] less than computed tomography.<ref name="pmid18289575"/>

The test was first described in the [[English language|English]] medical literature in 2001, by a group of [[urologist]]s in [[Germany]].  From 1994 to 1999, they gave {{convert|250|g|oz}} of poppy seeds to a series of 17 patients, then examined the patients' urine for two days.  The test results were correct for all patients:  11 patients with fistulas did pass poppy seeds in their urine and 6 patients without fistulas did not pass poppy seeds.<ref name="pmid11458060">{{cite journal
