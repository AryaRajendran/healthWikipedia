A '''vaginal microbicide''' is a [[microbicide]] for [[vagina]]l use. Most commonly such a product would be a topical gel or cream inserted into the vagina so that it may treat some infection in the vagina, such as types of [[vaginitis]].

Along with [[rectal microbicide]]s, vaginal microbicides are currently the subject of medical research on microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases to determine the circumstances under which and the extent to which they provide protection against infection. Researchers are trying to develop a product which would act as protection against the contraction of a [[sexually transmitted infection]] during vaginal [[sexual intercourse]].

{{main|Microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases}}
Scientists are trying to develop effective microbicides to reduce the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection, and in particular, to reduce the risk of contracting [[HIV]].

===Target market===
Researchers have investigated who has interest in using a vaginal microbicide.  [[Condoms]] are highly effective in preventing the transmission of infection, but worldwide, the decision to use condoms is more often a decision made by males than females.<ref name="Development"/> A vaginal microbicide which could prevent sexual transmission of infection would further empower women to influence the result of their sexual encounters.<ref name="Development"/> The demographic interested in using the produce included women with the following characteristics:<ref name="interest">{{cite journal|last=Darroch|first=Jacqueline E.|coauthors=Jennifer J. Frost|title=Women's Interest in Vaginal Microbicides|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|month=January/February|volume=31|issue=1|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3101699.html|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>

The number of women interested in using such a product has been characterized as being significant enough to merit product development and marketing.<ref name="interest"/>

===Characteristics===
The ideal vaginal microbicide would have the following characteristics:
*provide protection against infection<ref name="amfarpromise">{{cite web |url= http://www.amfar.org/lab/article.aspx?id=6324 |title=The Promise of an Effective Vaginal Microbicide |first1=Jeffery |last1=Laurence |first2=Rowena |last2=Johnston |work=amfar.org |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>
*not require application at the time of intercourse<ref name="amfarpromise"/>
*not harm the natural tissue<ref name="amfarpromise"/>

The criteria of not harming natural tissue has been the most troublesome aspect of product design.<ref name="amfarpromise"/>

==For HIV==
Several unrelated chemical mechanisms have been proposed for vaginal microbicides.  In all cases, the medicine would be contained in a gel or cream substrate and then inserted into the vagina, where the medicine would activate.<ref name="Development">{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pmed.0020142}}</ref>

===Surfactants===
The first vaginal microbicide which researchers studied was [[nonoxynol-9]], which acted as a [[surfactant]].<ref name="Development"/>

===Blocking HIV binding===
[[PRO 2000]], [[carageenan]], and cellulose sulphate have all been studied as microbicides to block HIV binding.<ref name="Development"/>

===Topical antiretrovirals===
[[Tenofovir]] has been studied as a topical [[antiretroviral]].<ref name="Development"/> One example of a tenofovir study is [[CAPRISA 004]].
