A '''dental dam''' or '''rubber dam''' is a rectangular sheet of [[latex]] used in [[dentistry]], in particular [[endodontic therapy]], to reduce contamination, and where [[composite fillings|dental composite]] is being placed, due to the need for the area to remain dry during filling placement. They are also used as a [[safe sex]] technique during [[cunnilingus]] and other [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualityandu.ca/stis-stds/how_do_i_protect_myself_from_stis_stds/dental_dam |title=Dental Dams &#124; Sexually Transmitted Infections &#124; Adults &#124; sexualityandu.ca - Your Link to Sexual Well-Being |publisher=sexualityandu.ca |date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

== In dentistry ==

A dental dam (sometimes known as a "Kofferdam"--from [[German language|German]]), is used mainly in [[endodontic]] treatment and when putting [[dental fillings|fillings]] into teeth. They are thin squares of [[latex]] [[rubber]]. [[Silicone]] versions are available for those with latex allergies.

The main function is to isolate the tooth being treated from its environment, in particular from the [[bacteria]] in the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]]. The rubber dam is held over individual teeth or groups of teeth by appropriate rubber dam clamps or threads (ligatures) along the edge of the gum. The tooth crown stands out from the rubber dam through individual holes made by a hole punch. This permits a clean and dry operative field, retracts the lips and cheeks, and enables treatment of the appropriate tooth without contamination from blood or saliva. Another function of the rubber dam is to protect the patient's airway from any materials which may fall into it during treatment.

Routine use of dental dams is not always appropriate because of some difficulties: for instance communication with the patient is significantly reduced and the patient may feel restricted. However for [[endodontic]] procedures it is considered mandatory. For adhesive dentistry procedures involving bonding [[dental composite]] it is to be encouraged as the operative field must avoid moisture contamination in order to get maximum bond strength from restorative material to tooth substance. Composite is affected by moisture during its setting reaction and thus a rubber dam is  considered advisable during placement.

==Safe sex==
In [[safe sex]] practices, dental dams are recognized for their use during [[cunnilingus]] and [[anilingus]] to protect against the transmission of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. After lubrication with water-based lubricant an unpunctured dental dam may be held over the [[vulva]] or [[anus]], allowing oral stimulation of these areas without transmission of [[bodily fluid]]s and skin contact.
