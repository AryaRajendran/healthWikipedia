'''Copper deficiency''' is a very rare [[hematological]] and [[neurological]] disorder.<ref name="Klevay" /><ref name="Half" /><ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals, in which it is commonly known as "[[swayback]]"<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element copper.<ref name= "Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> Copper is ubiquitous and daily requirement is low making acquired copper deficiency very rare. Copper deficiency can manifest in parallel with vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies .<ref name="Half" /> The most common cause of copper deficiency is a remote gastrointestinal surgery, such as gastric bypass surgery, due to malabsorption of copper, or zinc toxicity. On the other hand, [[Menkes disease]] is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal.<ref name="Kodama" />  
Copper is involved in normalized function of many enzymes, such as [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is complex IV in mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]], [[ceruloplasmin]], Cu/Zn [[superoxide dismutase]], and in [[amine oxidase]]s.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" />  These enzyme catalyze reactions for [[oxidative phosphorylation]], iron transportation, antioxidant and free radical scavenging and neutralization, and [[neurotransmitter]] synthesis, respectively.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> A regular diet contains a variable amount of copper, but may provide 5&nbsp;mg/day, of which only 20-50% is absorbed.<ref name="Half" /> The diet of the elderly may contain a lower copper content than the recommended daily intake.<ref name="Half" /> Dietary copper can be found in whole grain cereals, legumes, oysters, organ meats (particularly liver), cherries, dark chocolate, fruits, leafy green vegetables, nuts, poultry, prunes, and soybeans products like tofu.<ref name="Source" /> The deficiency in copper can cause many hematological manifestations, such as [[myelodysplasia]], [[anemia]], [[leukopenia]] (low white blood cell count) and [[neutropenia]] (low count of [[neutrophils]], a type of white blood cell that is often called "the first line of defense" for the immune system).<ref name="Half" /> Copper deficiency has long been known for as a cause of  [[myelodysplasia]] (when a blood profile has indicators of possible future [[leukemia]] development), but it was not until recently in 2001 that copper deficiency was associated with neurological manifestations. Some neurological manifestations can be [[sensory ataxia]] (irregular coordination due to proprioceptive loss), spasticity, muscle weakness, and more rarely visual loss due to [[peripheral neuropathy]] (damage in the peripheral nerves), [[myelopathy]] (disease of the spinal cord), and rarely optic neuropathy.

==Symptoms==
===Hematological Presentation===
[[File:Ring Sideroblast smear 2010-01-13.JPG|thumb|Ring Sideroblast smear 2010-01-13]]
The characteristic hematological (blood) effects of copper deficiency are [[anemia]] (which may be [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]], normocytic or [[macrocytic anemia|macrocytic]]) and [[neutropenia]].<ref name="Klevay" /> [[Thrombocytopenia]] (low blood [[platelets]]) is unusual.<ref name="Half" /><ref name="Kumar" /> 

The peripheral blood and [[Bone marrow examination|bone marrow aspirate]] findings in copper deficiency can mimic [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].<ref name="Fong" /> [[Bone marrow examination|Bone marrow aspirate]] in both conditions may show [[dysplasia]] of blood cell precursors and the presence of ring sideroblasts ([[erythoblasts]] containing multiple iron granules around the nucleus). Unlike most cases of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], the bone marrow aspirate in copper deficiency characteristically shows cytoplasmic [[vacuoles]] within red and white cell precursors, and [[karyotyping]] in cases of copper deficiency does not reveal cytogenetic features characteristic of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].<ref name="Klevay" /><ref name="Kumar" />

Anemia and neutropenia typically resolve within six weeks of copper replacement.<ref name="Fong" />

===Neurological Presentation===
Copper deficiency can cause a wide variety of neurological problems including, [[myelopathy]], peripheral [[neuropathy]], and [[optic neuropathy]].<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /><ref name="Kumar" />

====Myelopathy====
Sufferers typically present difficulty walking ([[gait]] difficulty) caused by [[sensory ataxia]] (irregular muscle coordination) due to [[dorsal column]] dysfunction<ref name="Kumar" /> or degeneration of the spinal cord ([[myelopathy]]).<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /><ref name="Jaiser, similar" /> Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk. They often feel tremors in their torso, causing side way jerks and lunges.<ref name="Gait" />  

In brain MRI, there is often an increased [[T2]] signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with [[myelopathy]] caused by copper deficiency.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /><ref name="Kumar" /><ref name="MRI" /> T2 signalling is often an indicator of some kind of neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /><ref name="Kumar" /> Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to [[subacute combined degeneration]] (SCD).<ref name="Jaiser, similar" /> [[Subacute combined degeneration]] is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead [[vitamin B12]] deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.<ref name="MRI" />

====Peripheral Neuropathy====
Another common symptom of copper deficiency is [[peripheral neuropathy]], which is numbness or tingling that can start in the extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso.<ref name="Kumar" /><ref name="Pineles" /> In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69 year old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms.<ref name="Jaiser, masquerade" /> These symptoms included  diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation was lost in the sternum, and markedly reduced [[proprioception]] or sensation about the self’s orientation.<ref name="Jaiser, masquerade" /> Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /><ref name="Pineles" /> This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral [[neuropathy]] can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.

====Optic Neuropathy====

Some patients suffering from copper deficiency have shown signs of vision and color loss.<ref name="Pineles" /> The vision is usually lost in the peripheral views of the eye.<ref name="Pineles" /> The bilateral vision loss is usually very gradual.<ref name="Spinazzi"/><ref name="Pineles" />  An [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT) shows some nerve fiber layer loss in most patients, suggesting the vision loss and color vision loss was secondary to [[optic neuropathy]] or neurodegeneration.<ref name="Pineles" />

== Causes ==
===Surgery===
[[Bariatric surgery]] is a common cause of copper deficiency.<ref name="Klevay" /><ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> [[Bariatric surgery]], such as [[gastric bypass surgery]], is often used for weight control of the morbidly obese. The disruption of the intestines and stomach from the surgery can cause absorption difficulties not only as regards copper, but also for iron and [[vitamin B12]] and many other nutrients.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> The symptoms of copper deficiency myelopathy may take a long time to develop, sometimes decades before the [[myelopathy]] symptoms manifest.

===Zinc Toxicity===
Increased consumption of [[zinc]] is another cause of copper deficiency.<ref name="Kumar" />  [[Zinc]] is often used for the prevention or treatment of common colds and [[sinusitis]] (inflammation of sinuses due to an infection), ulcers, [[sickle cell disease]], [[celiac disease]], memory impairment and acne.<ref name="Kumar" /> Zinc is found in many common vitamin supplements and is also found in denture creams.<ref name="Kumar" /><ref name="Spinazzi"/><ref name="Hendra" /> Recently, several cases of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy were found to be caused by prolonged use of denture creams containing high quantities of zinc.<ref name="Spinazzi"/><ref name="Hendra" />  

Metallic zinc is the core of all United States currency coins, including copper coated pennies. People who ingest massive amount of coins will have elevated zinc levels, leading to zinc toxicity induced copper deficiency and thus displaying neurological symptoms. This was the case for a 57 year old woman diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="Dawn" /> This woman consumed over 600 coins, and started to show neurological symptoms such as unsteady [[gait]] and mild [[ataxia]].<ref name="Dawn" />

===Hereditary Disorders===
[[File:Menkes disease4.jpg|thumb|Menkes disease showing symptoms of the sparse, steel colored "kinky hair" and paleness]]
[[Menkes disease]] is a congenital disease that is a cause of copper deficiency.<ref name="Kodama" /><ref name="Kumar" /><ref name="Kaler" /> Menkes disease is a hereditary condition caused by a defective gene involved with the metabolism of copper in the body.<ref name="Kumar" /> Menkes disease involves a wide variety of symptoms including floppy muscle tone, [[seizures]], abnormally low temperatures, and a peculiar steel color hair that feels very rough.<ref name="Kodama" /><ref name="Kaler" /> Menkes disease is usually a fatal disease with most children dying within the first ten years of life.<ref name="Kodama" /><ref name="Kaler" />

===Other===
It is rarely suggested that excess iron supplementation causes copper deficiency [[myelopathy]].<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" />
Another rarer cause of copper deficiency is [[celiac disease]], probably due to malabsorption in the intestines.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" />
Still, a large percentage, around 20%, of cases have unknown causes.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" />

==Biochemical Etiology==
Copper functions as a prosthetic group, which permits electron transfers in key enzymatic pathways like the [[electron transport chain]].<ref name="Half" /><ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> Copper is integrated in the enzymes [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is involved in [[cellular respiration]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]], Cu/Zn dismutase, which is involved in [[antioxidant]] defense, and many more listed in the table below.<ref name="Half" />

===Neurological Etiology===
[[File:Complex IV.svg|thumb|Cytochrome c Oxidase mechanism in mitochondrial membrane]]

====Cytochrome c Oxidase====

There have been several hypotheses about the role of copper and some of its neurological manifestations. Some suggest that disruptions in [[cytochrome c oxidase]], also known as Complex IV, of the electron transport chain is responsible for the spinal cord degeneration.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /><ref name="Jaiser, similar" />

====Methylation Cycle====
[[File:Myelinated neuron.jpg|thumb|Myelinated neuron]]
Another hypothesis is that copper deficiency myelopathy is caused by disruptions in the [[methylation]] cycle.<ref name="Jaiser, similar" /> The [[methylation]] cycle causes a transfer of a methyl group (-CH3) from methyltetrahydrofolate to a range of [[macromolecules]] by the suspected copper dependent enzyme [[methionine synthase]].<ref name="Jaiser, similar" /> This cycle is able to produce [[purines]], which are a component of DNA [[nucleotide bases]], and also [[myelin]] proteins.<ref name="Jaiser, similar" /> The spinal cord is surrounded by a layer of protective protein coating called [[myelin]] (see figure). When this [[methionine synthase]] enzyme is disrupted, the methylation decreases and [[myelination]] of the spinal cord is impaired. This cycle ultimately causes [[myelopathy]].<ref name="Jaiser, similar" />

===Hematological Etiology===
====Iron Transportation====
The [[anemia]] caused by copper deficiency is thought to be caused by impaired iron transport. [[Hephaestin]] is a copper containing [[ferroxidase]] enzyme located in the duodenal muscosa that oxidizes iron and facilitate its transfer across the basolateral membrane into circulation.<ref name="Klevay" /> Another iron transporting enzyme is [[ceruloplasmin]].<ref name="Klevay" /> This enzyme is required to mobilize iron from the reticuloendothelial cell to plasma.<ref name="Klevay" />  [[Ceruloplasmin]] also oxidizes iron from its ferrous state to the ferric form that is required for iron binding.<ref name="Kodama" /> Impairment in these copper dependent enzymes that transport iron may cause the secondary iron deficiency anemia.<ref name="Klevay" /> Another speculation for the cause of anemia is involving the mitochondrial enzyme [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (complex IV in the electron transport chain). Studies have shown that animal models with impaired [[cytochrome c oxidase]] failed to synthesize [[heme]] from [[ferric]] iron at the normal rate.<ref name="Klevay" />  The lower rate of the enzyme might also cause the excess iron to clump, giving the heme an unusual pattern.<ref name="Klevay" /> This unusual pattern is also known as ringed [[sideroblastic]] anemia cells.

====Cell Growth Halt====
The cause of [[neutropenia]] is still unclear; however, the arrest of maturing [[myelocyte]]s, or [[neutrophil]] precursors, may cause the [[neutrophil]] deficiency.<ref name="Klevay" /><ref name="Half" />

====Zinc Intoxication====
Zinc intoxication may cause [[anemia]] by blocking the absorption of copper from the stomach and [[duodenum]].<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> Zinc also upregulates the expression of [[chelator]] [[metallothionein]] in [[enterocytes]], which are the majority of cells in the intestinal epithelium.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> Since copper has a higher affinity for [[metallothionein]] than zinc, the copper will remain bound inside the [[enterocyte]], which will be later eliminated through the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /> This mechanism is exploited therapeutically to achieve negative balance in [[Wilson’s disease]], which involves an excess of copper.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" />

==Treatment==
Copper deficiency is a very rare disease and is often misdiagnosed several times by physicians before concluding the deficiency of copper through differential diagnosis (copper serum test and [[bone marrow biopsy]] are usually conclusive in diagnosing copper deficiency).  On average, patients are diagnosed with copper deficiency around 1.1 years after their first symptoms are reported to a physician.<ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" />
Copper deficiency can be treated with either oral copper supplementation or [[intravenous]] copper.<ref name="Kumar" /> If zinc intoxication is present, discontinuation of zinc may be sufficient to restore copper levels back to normal, but this usually is a very slow process.<ref name="Kumar" /> People who suffer from zinc intoxication will usually have to take copper supplements in addition to ceasing zinc consumption. Hematological manifestations are often quickly restored back to normal.<ref name="Kumar" /> The progression of the neurological symptoms will be stopped by appropriate treatment, but often with residual neurological disability.
