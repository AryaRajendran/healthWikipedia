==History==
In early 1820, two chemists, in two separate reports, described a white solid with a pungent odor derived from the distillation of [[coal tar]]. In 1821, [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]] cited these two disclosures and then described many of this substance's properties and the means of its production. He proposed the name ''naphthaline'', as it had been derived from a kind of [[naphtha]] (a broad term encompassing any volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture, including coal tar).<ref>{{cite journal | author = John Kidd | year = 1821 | title = Observations on Naphthalene, a peculiar substance resembling a concrete essential oil, which is produced during the decomposition of coal tar, by exposure to a red heat | journal = Philosophical Transactions | volume = 111 | pages = 209–221 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1821.0017}}</ref> Naphthalene's chemical formula was determined by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1826.

==Structure and reactivity==
A naphthalene molecule can be viewed as the fusion of a pair of benzene rings. (In [[organic chemistry]], rings are ''fused'' if they share two or more atoms.) As such, naphthalene is classified as a benzenoid [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH). There are two sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms: the ''alpha'' positions are positions 1, 4, 5, and 8 on the drawing below, and the ''beta'' positions are positions 2, 3, 6, and 7.

Unlike [[benzene]], the carbon–carbon bonds in naphthalene are not of the same length. The bonds C1–C2, C3–C4, C5–C6 and C7–C8 are about 1.36 Å (136 pm) in length, whereas the other carbon–carbon bonds are about 1.42 Å (142 pm) long. This difference, which was established by [[X-ray diffraction]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, is consistent with the [[valence bond theory|valence bond]] model of bonding in naphthalene that involves three [[resonance structure]]s (as shown below); whereas the bonds C1–C2, C3–C4, C5–C6 and C7–C8 are double in ''two'' of the three structures, the others are double in only one.

:[[Image:naphthalene resonance.PNG|Resonance structures of naphthalene]]

Like benzene, naphthalene can undergo [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. For many electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, naphthalene reacts under milder conditions than does benzene. For example, whereas both benzene and naphthalene react with [[chlorine]] in the presence of a [[ferric chloride]] or [[aluminium chloride]] catalyst, naphthalene and chlorine can react to form [[1-chloronaphthalene]] even without a catalyst. Likewise, whereas both benzene and naphthalene can be alkylated using [[Friedel–Crafts reaction]]s, naphthalene can also be alkylated by reaction with [[alkene]]s or [[alcohol]]s, with [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] or [[phosphoric acid]] as the catalyst.

===Substituted derivatives===
Two [[isomer]]s are possible for mono-substituted naphthalenes, corresponding to substitution at an alpha or beta position. Usually, electrophiles attack at the alpha position. The selectivity for alpha over beta substitution can be rationalized in terms of the resonance structures of the intermediate: for the alpha substitution intermediate, seven resonance structures can be drawn, of which four preserve an aromatic ring. For beta substitution, the intermediate has only six resonance structures, and only two of these are aromatic. Sulfonation, however, gives a mixture of the "alpha" product 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid and the "beta" product 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, with the ratio dependent on reaction conditions. The 1-isomer forms predominantly at 25 °C, and the 2-isomer at 160 °C.

Naphthalene can be [[hydrogenate]]d under high pressure in the presence metal [[catalyst]]s to give 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene or [[tetralin]] ({{chem|C|10|H|12}}). Further hydrogenation yields decahydronaphthalene or [[decalin]] ({{chem|C|10|H|18}}). [[Oxidation]] with [[chromate]] or [[permanganate]], or catalytic oxidation with {{chem|O|2}} and a [[vanadium]] [[catalyst]], gives [[phthalic acid]].

==Production==
Most naphthalene is derived from [[coal tar]]. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during [[petroleum refining]], but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a minor component of naphthalene production.

Naphthalene is the most abundant single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, [[distillation]] of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with a variety of other [[aromatic compound]]s. This oil, after being washed with aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] to remove [[acid]]ic components (chiefly various [[phenol]]s), and with sulfuric acid to remove [[base (chemistry)|basic]] components, undergoes [[fractional distillation]] to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound [[benzothiophene]] (<2%), [[indane]] (0.2%), [[indene]] (<2%), and methylnaphthalene (<2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] from any of a variety of solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80 °C (melting point). Approximately 1M tons are produced annually.<ref name=Ullmann>Gerd Collin, Hartmut Höke, Helmut Greim "Naphthalene and Hydronaphthalenes"in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2003. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a17_001.pub2}}. Article Online Posting Date: March 15, 2003.</ref>

In North America, coal tar producers are [[Koppers]] Inc. and Recochem Inc., and petroleum-derived producer is Advanced Aromatics, L.P.

==Natural occurrence==
Trace amounts of naphthalene are produced by [[magnolia]]s and specific types of [[deer]], as well as the [[Formosan subterranean termite]], possibly produced by the termite as a repellant against "ants, poisonous fungi and nematode worms."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/76115.stm |title=Termite 'mothball' keep insects at bay |publisher=BBC News |work=Sci/Tech |date=April 8, 1998}}</ref> Some strains of the [[endophytic]] fungus ''[[Muscodor albus]]'' produce naphthalene among a range of volatile organic compounds, while ''[[Muscodor vitigenus]]'' produces naphthalene almost exclusively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Daisy BH, Strobel GA, Castillo U, ''et al.'' |title=Naphthalene, an insect repellent, is produced by ''Muscodor vitigenus'', a novel endophytic fungus |journal=Microbiology (Reading, Engl.) |volume=148 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=3737–41 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12427963 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/148/11/3737}}</ref>

Naphthalene has been found in meteorites. It has also been discovered in the interstellar medium in the direction of the star Cernis 52 in the constellation [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080919075007.htm |title=Interstellar Space Molecules That Help Form Basic Life Structures Identified |work=Science Daily |date=September 2008}}</ref>

===Gaseous naphthalene===
Recent research at the University of Georgia, led by Dr. Michael Duncan, has shown that protonated cations of naphthalene are the source of part of the spectrum of the Unidentified Interstellar Bands (UIBs). The gaseous naphthalene found in space is different from crystalline form typically used in mothballs in that it has an additional hydrogen atom, with the empirical formula: {{chem|C|10|H|9|+}}. The UIBs have been observed by astronomers, and until recently, there has been no solid evidence identifying the compounds responsible for them. The research has recently been publicized as "Mothballs in Space."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3243/mothballs-in-space | title=Mothballs in Space|work = Astrobiology Magazine | accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref>

==Uses==

===As a chemical intermediate===
Naphthalene is used mainly as a precursor to other chemicals. The single largest use of naphthalene is the industrial production of [[phthalic anhydride]], although more phthalic anhydride is made from [[O-Xylene|''o''-xylene]]. Other naphthalene-derived chemicals include alkyl naphthalene sulfonate [[surfactant]]s, and the [[insecticide]] [[carbaryl|1-naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate (''carbaryl'')]]. Naphthalenes substituted with combinations of strongly electron-donating [[functional group]]s, such as [[alcohol]]s and [[amine]]s, and strongly electron-withdrawing groups, especially [[sulfonic acid]]s, are intermediates in the preparation of many synthetic [[dye]]s. The hydrogenated naphthalenes tetrahydronaphthalene ([[tetralin]]) and decahydronaphthalene ([[decalin]]) are used as low-volatility [[solvents]]. Naphthalene is also used in the synthesis of [[2-naphthol]], a precursor for various dyestuffs, pigments, rubber processing chemicals and other miscellaneous chemicals and pharmaceuticals.<ref name=Ullmann/>

Naphthalene sulfonic acids are used in the manufacture of naphthalene sulfonate polymer [[plasticizers]] ([[dispersants]]), which are used to produce [[concrete]] and [[plasterboard]] ([[wallboard]] or [[drywall]]). They are also used as dispersants in synthetic and natural rubbers, and as [[tanning]] agents ([[syntan]]s) in leather industries, [[agricultural]] formulations (dispersants for [[pesticides]]), [[dyes]] and as a dispersant in [[lead–acid battery]] plates.

Naphthalene sulfonate polymers are produced by reacting naphthalene with sulfuric acid and then polymerizing with [[formaldehyde]], followed by neutralization with [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[calcium hydroxide]]. These products are commercially sold in solution (water) or dry powder form.

===Wetting agent and surfactant===
Alkyl naphthalene sulfonates (ANS) are used in many industrial applications as nondetergent [[Surfactant|wetting agents]] that effectively disperse colloidal systems in aqueous media. The major commercial applications are in the agricultural chemical industry, which uses ANS for wettable powder and wettable granular (dry-flowable) formulations, and the textile and fabric industry, which utilizes the wetting and defoaming properties of ANS for bleaching and dyeing operations.

===As a fumigant===
Naphthalene has been used as a household [[fumigant]]. It was once the primary ingredient in [[mothball]]s, though its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as [[1,4-Dichlorobenzene|1,4-dichlorobenzene]]. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many [[moth]]s that attack textiles. Other fumigant uses of naphthalene include use in soil as a fumigant pesticide, in [[attic]] spaces to repel animals and insects, and in museum storage-drawers and cupboards to protect the contents from attack by insect pests.

===Niche applications===
It is used in pyrotechnic special effects such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions. <!--what??It is used to create artificial pores in the manufacture of high-porosity grinding wheels.--> In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. Naphthalene and its alkyl [[homolog (chemistry)|homologs]] are the major constituents of [[creosote]]. Naphthalene is used in engineering to study heat transfer using mass sublimation.

==Health effects==
Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy [[red blood cell]]s. Humans, in particular children, have developed this condition, known as [[hemolytic anemia]], after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene. Symptoms include [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale [[skin]]. Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may cause [[confusion]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[blood]] in the [[urine]], and [[jaundice]] (yellow coloration of the skin).<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002477|Naphthalene poisoning}}</ref>

When the U.S. National Toxicology Program exposed male and female rats and mice to naphthalene vapors on weekdays for two years,<ref>{{cite web | title=NTP Technical Reports 410 and 500 | work=NTP Technical Reports 410 and 500, available from NTP: Long-Term Abstracts & Reports| url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/INDEX.CFM?OBJECTID=0847DDA0-F261-59BF-FAA04EB1EC032B61| accessdate=March 6, 2005}}</ref> male and female rats exhibited evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of adenoma and neuroblastoma of the nose, female mice exhibited some evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of alveolar and bronchiolar adenomas of the lung, and male mice exhibited no evidence of carcinogenic activity.

The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC)<ref>{{cite web | title=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | work=Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Some Traditional Herbal Medicines, Some Mycotoxins, Naphthalene and Styrene, Vol. 82 (2002) (p. 367)| url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol82/index.php | accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref> classifies naphthalene as possibly carcinogenic to humans and animals ([[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]). The IARC also points out that acute exposure causes cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits, and mice; and that hemolytic anemia, described above, can occur in children and infants after oral or inhalation exposure or after maternal exposure during pregnancy. Under California's [[Proposition 65]], naphthalene is listed as "known to the State to cause cancer".<ref>[http://www.oehha.org/prop65.html Proposition 65], Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment</ref>

Over 400 million people have an inherited condition called [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]]. Exposure to naphthalene is more harmful for these people and may cause [[hemolytic anemia]] at lower doses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In [[China]], the use of naphthalene in mothballs is forbidden.<ref>{{citation | title=国务院经贸办、卫生部关于停止生产和销售萘丸提倡使用樟脑制品的通知（国经贸调（1993）64号）}}</ref> It is due partly to the health effects as well as the wide use of natural [[camphor]] as replacement. However naphthalene is widely produced for moth balls and currently exported from China<ref>[http://www.alibaba.com/countrysearch/CN/moth-ball.html] Search of Chinese online shop.</ref>
