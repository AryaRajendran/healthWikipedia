The '''''Journal of the National Cancer Institute''''' (''JNCI'') is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] covering research in [[oncology]] that was established in August 1940. It is published twice per month by [[Oxford University Press]] and is edited by [[Barnett S. Kramer]]. It was merged with '''''Cancer Treatment Reports''''' in January 1988. ''JNCI'' used to be the official journal of the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), however in 1996 the NCI and ''JNCI'' agreed to grow apart. Over the next five years, ''JNCI'' became independent of the NCI.

A related publication is '''''Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs''''' (''JNCI Monographs''), established in 1959, which publishes manuscripts from cancer and cancer-related conferences, as well as groups of papers on specific subjects related to cancer. In January 1986, '''''Cancer Treatment Symposia''''' was merged with ''JNCI Monographs''.
