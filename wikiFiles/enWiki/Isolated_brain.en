'''Isolated brain''' refers to keeping a [[brain]] alive [[in-vitro]]. This is done either by [[perfusion]] by a [[Blood substitutes|blood substitute]], often an oxygenated solution of various salts, or by submerging the brain in oxygenated artificial [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).<ref>von Bohlen and Halbach O. The isolated mammalian brain: an in vivo preparation suitable for pathway tracing. Eur J Neurosci. 1999 Mar;11(3):1096-100. PMID 10103102</ref> It is the biological counterpart of [[brain in a vat]]. A related concept, attaching the brain or head to the [[circulatory system]] of another organism, is called a [[head transplant]]. An isolated brain however is more typically attached to an artificial perfusion device rather than a biological body.

The brains of many different organisms have been kept alive in-vitro for hours, or in some cases days. The central nervous system of [[invertebrate]] animals is often easily maintained as they need less oxygen and to a larger extent get their oxygen from CSF, for this reason their brains are more easily maintained without perfusion.<ref>Luksch H, Walkowiak W, Muñoz A, ten Donkelaar HJ. The use of in vitro preparations of the isolated amphibian central nervous system in neuroanatomy and electrophysiology. J Neurosci Methods. 1996 Dec;70(1):91-102. PMID 8982986</ref> Mammalian brains on the other hand have a much lesser degree of survival without perfusion and an artificial blood perfusate is usually used.

For methodological reasons, most research on isolated mammalian brains has been done with guinea pigs. These animals have a significantly larger basilar artery (a major artery of the brain) compared to rats and mice, which makes cannulation (to supply CSF) much easier.

* 1812 - Julien Jean César Le Gallois (a.k.a. Legallois) put forth the original idea for resuscitating decapitated heads through the use of blood transfusion.<ref>[http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=30&hl=en&safe=off&q=(%22Le%20Gallois%22%20OR%20Legallois)%201812&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=ws Google Scholar:("Le Gallois" OR Legallois) 1812]</ref>
* 1818 - [[Mary Shelley]] published Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus
* 1836 - [[Astley Cooper]] showed in rabbits that compression of the carotid and vertebral arteries leads to death of an animal; such deaths can be prevented if the circulation of oxygenated blood to the brain is rapidly restored.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1363110/pdf/jphysiol01296-0122.pdf Accessory sources of blood supply to the brain of the cat]</ref>
* 1857 - [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard|Charles Brown-Sequard]] decapitated a dog, waited ten minutes, attached four rubber tubes to the arterial trunks of the head, and injected blood containing oxygen by means of a syringe.  Two or three minutes later voluntary movements of the eyes and muscles of the muzzle resumed.

== In philosophy ==
In [[philosophy]], the [[brain in a vat]] is any of a variety of [[thought experiment]]s intended to draw out certain features of our ideas about [[knowledge]], [[reality]], [[truth]], [[mind]], and [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]]. A contemporary version of the argument originally given by [[Descartes]] in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (i.e., that he could not trust his perceptions on the grounds that an [[evil demon]] might, conceivably, be controlling his every experience), the ''brain in a vat'' is the idea that a brain can be fooled into anything when fed appropriate stimuli.

The inherently philosophical idea has also became a staple of many [[science fiction]] stories, with many such stories involving a [[mad scientist]] who might remove a person's [[brain]] from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its [[neurons]] by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such science fiction stories, the computer would then be simulating a [[virtual reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the "disembodied" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.

== Growing an isolated brain ==
Isolated biological "brains", grown from cultured neurons which were originally separated, have been developed.  These are not the same thing as the brains of organisms, but they have been used to control some simple robotic systems.

In 2004 Thomas DeMarse and Karl Dockendorf make an ''adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays''.<ref>[http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf Thomas DeMarse, Karl Dockendorf, ''Adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays'']</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm Brain in a dish acts as autopilot, living computer], Science Daily</ref>

Teams at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Reading have created neurological entities integrated with a robot body. The brain receives input from sensors on the robot body and the resultant output from the brain provides the robot's only motor signals.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78317-6_3  D.

== Isolated brains in fiction ==
The concept of a brain in a jar (or [[brain in a vat]]) is a common theme in science fiction:

*Many people in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime franchise possess [[cyberbrain]]s, which can sustain a modified human brain within a cybernetic body indefinitely.

*In the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'']] series of games, isolated brains are used to control robots.

*The [[Mi-go]] aliens in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], first appearing in the story "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" (1931), can transport humans from Earth to Pluto (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's brain and placing it into a "brain cylinder", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.

*In [[Alexander Beliaev]]'s novel ''Head of Prof. Dowell'' (1925), Professor Dowell discovers a way of keeping heads of dead people alive and even to give them new bodies. After his death Dowell himself becomes a subject of such an experiment

*In ''[[Donovan's Brain]]'' (see term), the 1942 science fiction novel by [[Curt Siodmak]] (filmed three times in different versions: 1942, 1953 and 1962), the brain of a ruthless millionaire is kept alive in a tank where it grows to monstrous proportions and powers.

*In [[Roald Dahl]]'s short story "[[William and Mary (short story)|William and Mary]]" (1960), after William's death his brain is kept alive on an artificial heart.

*The [[Humans as Gods#Ruinators|Ruinators]], later known as the Demiurges, are the immensely cyborgized alien society in the ''[[Humans as Gods]]'', the 1966-1977 sci-fi trilogy by [[Sergey Snegov]]. They use the isolated brains of the highly intelligent species [[Humans as Gods#Galaxians|Galaxians]] as the organic supercomputers in charge of the [[Humans as Gods#Metrics Stations|Metrics Stations]], the primary and most secret military defense structure of the Ruinators' Empire. The brains are being extracted from the prisoners' babies and grown artificially in the spheres filled with the nutrient liquid. Among the most important characters of the 2nd and 3d novels comes the [[Humans as Gods#Vagrant|Brain of the Third Planet]], later known as Vagrant or Voice, who has somehow developed self-consciousness and later rebelled against the Ruinators. Due to the Vagrant's fervent desire for a life of those embodied, the Brain has been surgically put into the dragon body, whose inherent brain was destroyed in the recent battle. Vagrant enjoyed a sentient dragon's life for a few decades after that, until the body grew too senile, and on the threshold of the dragon's death the brain was removed again to assume control over a starship.

*In the 1970s ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', Solon, an authority on micro-surgical techniques, transplants Morbius's brain into an artificial translucent brain cylinder casing.  Additionally, in the modern ''Doctor Who'' series (2005–present), the recurring antagonists known as the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] are presented as human brains (in [[The Pandorica Opens|one instance]], an entire human head) encased in mechanical exoskeletons, connected by an artificial nervous system; this is ostensibly done as an "upgrade" from the comparatively fragile human body to a far more durable and longer-lasting shell.  Another group of modern ''Who'' foes, the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Toclafane|Toclafane]], were revealed to be human heads encased in flying, weaponized spheres, the final forms of humans from the far future who turned to desperate measures in order to survive the conditions of the impending [[heat death of the universe]].

*In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' prequel trilogy to the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', [[Technology of the Dune universe#Cymek|Cymeks]] are disembodied brains that wear robotic bodies.

*The mad scientist in the French movie ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' has a "brain in a vat" for a companion.

*In ''[[Robocop 2]]'', the brain, eyes, and much of the nervous system of the Detroit drug lord Cain is harvested by OCP officials to use in their plans for an upgraded "Robocop 2" [[cyborg]]. These systems are stored in a vat shortly after the surgery, where the disembodied Cain can still see the remains of his former body being discarded before being placed into the fitted robotic skeleton.

*The B'omarr Monks, of the [[Star Wars]] Universe, would surgically remove their brains from their bodies and continue their existence as a brain in a jar. They believe that cutting themselves off from civilization and all corporeal distractions leads to enlightenment. These monks are easily identified in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' as the spider like creature that walks past [[C-3PO]] as he enters [[Jabba’s Palace]].

*[[Observer (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Observer]] from ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' carries his brain in a [[Petri dish]].

*In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', numerous technological advances have been made by the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]") and also apparently [[Dick Clark]] of [[Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve]] fame still doing the countdown in the year 2999, has resulted in many political figures and celebrities being active; this became the writers' excuse to feature and poke fun at celebrities in the show.

*A [[brainship]] is a fictional concept of an interstellar starship. A brainship is made by inserting the disembodied brain and nervous system or malformed body of a human being into a life-support system, and connecting it surgically to a series of computers via delicate synaptic connections (a [[Brain&ndash;computer interface]].) The brain "feels" the ship (or any other connected peripherals) as part of its own body. An example, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969) short story collection by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] is about the brainship ''Helva''.

*The video game ''[[Cortex Command]]'' revolves around the idea of brains being separated from physical bodies, and used to control units on a battlefield.

*The [[science fantasy]] [[television series]] [[LEXX]] includes a robot head containing human brain tissue. Also whenever the current Divine Shadow body dies his brain is removed and placed in a device that allows him to speak and kept with rest of the Divine Predecessors.

*In the [[Doctor Who]] episodes "[[The_End_of_the_World_(Doctor_Who)|The End of the World]]" and "[[New Earth]]," [[Cassandra_(Doctor_Who)|Lady Cassandra]] is an isolated brain attached to a canvas of skin with a face.

*In the movie [[Blood Diner]], two cannibal brothers bring their uncle's (isolated) brain back to life to help them in their quest to restore life to the five million year old goddess Shitaar. Their uncle's brain instructs them to collect the required parts to resurrecting Shitaar - virgins, assorted body parts from whores, and the ingredients for a "blood buffet".

*In the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy film]] [[The Man with Two Brains]], the [[protagonist]], a pioneering [[neurosurgeon]], falls in love with a disembodied brain that was able to communicate with him [[Telepathy|telepathically]].
