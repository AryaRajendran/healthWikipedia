== Development ==
Although classically considered conjoined twinning (which it resembles), this anomaly is not normally due to the fusion or incomplete separation of two embryos. It is the result of a protein called [[Sonic hedgehog|sonic hedgehog homolog]] (SHH). (The name of this protein was inspired by the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] videogame character<ref>{{cite journal |author=Donahue JK |title=Gene therapy, angiogenesis, Sonic Hedgehog: Sonic the Hedgehog to the rescue? |journal=Gene Ther. |volume=13 |issue=13 |pages=998–9 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=17262905 |doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3302748 |url=http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/v13/n13/full/3302748a.html}}</ref> and is part of an idiosyncratic<ref name="Cameron">{{cite news|last=Cameron|first=David|title=Express Yourself (Space Savers issue).

The [[SHH protein]] and its corresponding gene have been found to play an important role in signaling craniofacial patterning during embryonic development. Among other things, the SHH protein governs the width of facial features. In excess it leads to widening of facial features and to duplication of facial structures.<ref name=Hu>{{cite journal |author=Hu D, Helms JA |title=The role of sonic hedgehog in normal and abnormal craniofacial morphogenesis |journal=Development |volume=126 |issue=21 |pages=4873–84 |date=1 November 1999|pmid=10518503 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10518503 }}</ref> The greater the widening, the more of the structures are duplicated, often in a mirror image form. This has been demonstrated in the laboratory by introducing pellets of the SHH protein into chicken embryos, resulting in chickens with duplicate beaks. Insufficient amounts of that protein lead to opposite conditions such as [[cyclopia]] where facial features are insufficiently developed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Young DL, Schneider RA, Hu D, Helms JA |title=Genetic and teratogenic approaches to craniofacial development |journal=Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=304–17 |year=2000 |pmid=11021632 |url=http://cro.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11021632 |doi=10.1177/10454411000110030201}}</ref>

Healthy brain development is also dependent on the signaling function of the SHH protein.<ref name="Sciencedaily">[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/03/010312072303.htm Sonic Hedgehog shapes the brain]. [http://www.sciencedaily.com/ ScienceDaily], 13 March 2001.
</ref> During embryonic development, the SHH protein directs embryonic cells to organize in specific areas that later become specialized neural tissues, thus controlling the size and shape of brain structures.

== Occurrences ==
Diprosopus often occurs in combination with other [[congenital disorder]]s, particularly [[anencephaly]], [[neural tube|neural tube defect]] and [[cardiac malformation]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=al Muti Zaitoun A, Chang J, Booker M |title=Diprosopus (partially duplicated head) associated with anencephaly: a case report |journal=Pathol.

Few two-faced animals have survived due to associated [[internal organ]] abnormalities and brain abnormalities. One of the most famous was Ditto the pig.<ref>{{cite book |author=Armand Marie Leroi |title=Mutants: on the form, varieties and errors of the human body |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York, N.Y |year=2005 |isbn=0-00-653164-4 }}</ref> Ditto was raised to adulthood, but died of [[pneumonia]] caused by food inhalation when breathing through one muzzle while eating with the other. 

Cats with the condition are known as '[[Janus]] cats', after the Roman god.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/30/two-faced-cat-guinness-world-record | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Cherry | last=Wilson | title=Two-faced cat is a record breaker | date=30 September 2011}}</ref> In July 2006, a 6-year-old male Janus cat called "Frank and Louie" from [[Millbury]], Massachusetts USA received publicity. In his case, only one [[esophagus]] (and possibly only one [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]) was functional and aided survival. In September 2011, when Frank and Louie was 12 years old, it was announced that he will appear in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-surviving Janus cat on record.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1061731--meet-frank-and-louie-the-longest-surviving-two-faced-cat?bn=1|title=Meet Frank and Louie, the longest surviving two-faced cat|last=Ngowi|first=Roderique|date=Sep 29 2011|work=thestar.com|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>

Most human infants with diprosopus are stillborn. Known instances of humans with diprosopus surviving for longer than minutes to hours past birth are very rare; only a few are recorded. In 2002 and 2003, two living male infants with partial diprosopus were described in the medical literature in separate case reports.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hähnel S, Schramm P, Hassfeld S, Steiner HH, Seitz A |title=Craniofacial duplication (diprosopus): CT, MR imaging, and MR angiography findings case report |journal=Radiology |volume=226 |issue=1 |pages=210–3 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12511692 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/226/1/210 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2261011754}}</ref><ref name="Wu">{{cite journal |author=Wu J, Staffenberg DA, Mulliken JB, Shanske AL |title=Diprosopus: a unique case and review of the literature |journal=Teratology |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=282–7 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12486761 |doi=10.1002/tera.10102 |url=http://www.newyorkcraniofacialsurgery.com/Resources/diprosopus.pdf}}</ref> One infant was born with duplication of the nose and the cerebral frontal lobes, two widely spaced eyes, a small, underdeveloped central eye socket, and a large, asymmetric mouth. The other infant was born with duplication of the upper and lower jaw, two tongues ending in the same base, [[Cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], a slightly divided tip of the nose, and two widely spaced eyes, as well as absence of the [[corpus callosum]], duplication of the pituitary gland and stalk, and abnormalities in the midbrain. Because they were born with a milder, partial form of diprosopus, both infants were considered candidates for surgical correction of their abnormal facial features.

=== Lali Singh ===
In 2008, a baby girl born in India, Lali Singh, became the most recently known person to have the condition diprosopus.<ref name=BBC/><ref name=ABC>[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Health/Story?id=4549608&page=1 Two-Faced Baby Triggers Shock and Awe] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] report. Accessed 21 April 2008.</ref> She was born March 10, 2008 in Sanai Sampūra village near [[Delhi]]; the birth was delayed by [[dystocia]] caused by her large head, and she was born in a hospital with an [[episiotomy]]. She was one of the very few infants with diprosopus to survive well past birth. She may have been the only known living individual with complete facial duplication. Her facial features included two pairs of eyes, two noses, and two mouths (but only one pair of ears). Lali Singh, daughter of Sushma and Vinod Singh, lived in the Indian village of [[Saini Sunpura]]. There, she was seen as the reincarnation of the goddess [[Durga]], who has three eyes. It was also thought that Lali was an incarnation of the Hindu god [[Ganesh]].

As of April 2008, Sushma and Vinod Singh had declined an offer from local doctors to evaluate their daughter through [[CAT scan|CT]] or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] scanning. Without diagnostic imaging, it was not possible to know the full extent to which the child's condition might have affected her brain and other vital structures in her head and neck. Thus, any estimation of her ability to survive or even thrive could only be speculative, though Lali's family described her as functioning normally. It is also unknown whether neurosurgeons or craniofacial surgeons, if consulted, would have had feasible solutions to offer with respect to corrective surgery. A local doctor told reporters that the baby should be considered a healthy child who currently was living a normal life, a previously unknown occurrence among sufferers of the disorder.<ref name=ABC/>

Lali's two middle eyes suffered from [[corneal opacity]] due to abnormal anatomy of the facial muscles, which prevented her from properly closing those eyes. (Before, it was wrongly blamed on [[camera flash]]es.)

[[Cleft palate]] caused difficulty feeding her under village conditions. A poor diet of bottle-fed sugar solution and diluted milk, allowed to drip down her throat as she could not suck properly because of the cleft palate, weakened her condition, and vomiting and infection started. Admission to hospital was delayed by discussion (including taking her back home from hospital) among her [[extended family]] and her village's [[Village head|headman]]. Finally, her parents alarmed at her illness and [[dehydration]], defied her other relatives and took her back to hospital, where under proper medical treatment including [[antibiotic]] and a [[saline drip]] she started to improve, stopped vomiting, started drinking milk and defecating normally; but 6 hours later, at two months old to the day, she died of a [[heart attack]].<ref>[[Channel 4]] UK television program ''[[Body Shock]]'', 10 pm to 11.10 pm Tuesday 16 September 2008</ref> She was buried in her village, as is usual in Hinduism with children who die very young. Later a [[Hindu temple|temple]] was built at the village in her memory.
