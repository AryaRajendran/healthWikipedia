'''Premastication''', '''pre-chewing''', or '''kiss feeding''' is the act of chewing food for the purpose of physically breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of [[mastication|masticating]] the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce [[baby food]] capable of being consumed by the child during the [[weaning]] process. The chewed food in the form of a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.<ref name=HolmesEA>{{citation|first=Wendy |last=Holmes |title=Influences on maternal and child nutrition in the highlands of the northern Lao PDR |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |year=2007 |volume=16 |number=3 |pages=537–545 |pmid=17704036}}</ref><ref name=Zhang>{{citation |first=Yuanyuan |last=Zhang |title=The role of pre-mastication in the evolution of complementary feeding strategies: a bio-cultural analysis |date=2007-05 |journal=Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Honors Theses |url=http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/7810/1/Zhang,%20Yuanyuan.pdf}}</ref>

The behaviour was common throughout human history and societies and observed in non-human animals. While premastication is less common in present day Western societies it was commonly practiced, and is still done in more traditional cultures.<ref name=Pelto/> Although the health benefits of premastication is still being actively studied the practice appears to confer certain nutritional and immunological benefits to the infant,<ref name=PA/> provided that the caretaker is in good health and not infected by pathogens.<ref name=JL/>

==Behavioural roots==
Premastication and mouth-to-mouth feeding in humans is postulated to have evolved from the regurgitation of food from parent to offspring or male to female ([[courtship feeding]]) and has been observed in numerous mammals and animals of other species.<ref name=EE>{{citation|title=Love and hate: the natural history of behavior patterns |first=Irenäus |last=Eibl-Eibesfeldt |publisher=Aldine Transaction|year=1971 |isbn=978-0202020389}}</ref> For instance, food begging behaviour observed in young wolves, wild dogs and certain gulls species, which involves the young approaching the beak or mouth of the adult with their own whereupon gaping their mouths or nuzzling, the adult would [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitate]] portions of food to feed the young.<ref>{{citation |title=Sociobiology |first=Edward O. |last=Wilson |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980}}</ref> However in the forementioned animals, this nuzzling behaviour and other types of mouth-to-mouth contact is also used for bonding, socialization, and courtship.<ref name=EEChapt>{{citation |title=Comparing behavior: studying man studying animals |editor-first=D.

===In Apes===
Young [[orangutan]]s also beg for food by such contact and accordingly their caretakers regurgitde to feed them.<ref>{{citation |title=Reaching Into Thought:The Minds of the Great Apes |first=Anne E. |last=Russon |first2=Kim A. |last2=Bard |first3=Sue Taylor |last3=Parker |publisher=Cambridge University Press, Nov 26, 1998}}</ref> Indeed, behaviours of mouth to mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding has been observed in anthropoid great apes such as [[gorilla]]s, orangutans, and [[chimpanzee]]s. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, either directly or indirectly from the mouth, has it behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.<ref name=EEHuman>{{citation |title=Human Ethology |first=Irenäus |last=Eibl-Eibesfeldt |publisher=Transaction Publishers |date=Oct 30 |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=MBQGXAlZRhwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=138}}</ref>

===Human Kiss Precursor===
In all human cultures premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing between mother and infant has been observed in all with kissing believed to be a socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. The similarities between kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss) are very similar in their executions; in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food.<ref name="EEChapt"/> In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of [[kiss]]ing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.<ref name=EE/><ref name=EEChapt/>

==History and culture==
Written records of premastication have been found in [[Ancient Egypt]], though the practice likely extends back into prehistoric times to non-human ancestors.<ref name=SK/> In the fifth century A.D. Roman culture, premastictaion of infant's food by caretakers were also common, though the lack of sanitation along with the practice contributed to infant mortality.<ref>{{citation |title=A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery:Excavation at Poggio Gramignano, Lugnano in Teverina |first=David |last=Soren |first2=Noelle |last2=Soren |publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER |year=1999}}</ref> Infants in [[Medieval Europe]] were fed an assortment of mashed, premasticated food or bread softened with liquids.<ref>{{citation |title=Daily Life in Medieval Europe |first=Jeffrey L. |last=Forgeng |first2=Jeffrey L. |last2=Singman |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999}}</ref>

Due to the attitudes in Western medicine of the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly disssuaded from premasticated due to concerns for the hygene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population,<ref>{{citation |title=Secondary anemia due to prolonged and exclusive milk feeding among Shoshone indian infants |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/27/1/67.full.pdf |last=Pijoan |first=M |last2=Elkin |first2=C.A. |year=1944 |journal=Journal of Nutrition |pages=67–75}}</ref> or resulted in malnuorished infants and children deprived of nourishment.<ref>{{citation |title=Food and Nutrition in Fiji: Food production, composition, and intake |first=A.

Although less prevalent in modern post-industrial Western societies, the offering of premasticated foods to infants is found in many traditional cultures and offers their infant numerous benefits.<ref>{{citation |title=The Evolution of Childhood: Relationships, Emotion, Mind |first=Melvin |last=Konner |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref> In [[North America]], premastication is still commonly used by in [[Black]] and [[Hispanic]] mothers,<ref>{{citation |title=Transcultural Concepts in Nursing Care |edition=5 |first=Margaret M. |last=Andrews |first2=Joyceen S. |last2=Boyle |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2008}}</ref> and commonly used by women of [[Inuit]] and [[Aleut people]]s.<ref>{{citation |title=Alaska Native Parents in Anchorage:Perspectives on Childrearing |first=Julie E. |last=Sprott |publisher=University Press of America |year=1992}}</ref>

==Health==
The act of premastication is commonly found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through [[saliva]] in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour.<ref name=Pelto/> Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{citation|title=Letter to the Editor

===Advantages===

====Breastmilk supplement====
Premastication is complementary to breastfeeding in the health practices of infants and young children, providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk,<ref name=Pelto/> and micronutrients such as [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[vitamin B12]] which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat.<ref>{{citation |title=Meat as a First Complementary Food for Breastfed Infants: Feasibility and Impact on Zinc Intake and Status |last=Krebs |first=Nancy F. |last=Westcott, |first=Jamie E |last=Butler |last=Robinson |last=Bell |last=Hambidge |journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition |date= 2006-02  |volume=42 |number=2 |pages=207–214 |doi=10.1097/01.mpg.0000189346.25172.fd}}</ref> Compounds in the saliva, such as [[haptocorrin]] also helps increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.

====Infant intake of heme iron====
Meats such as beef were likely premasticated during human evolution as hunter-gatherers. This animal-derived [[Bioinorganic chemistry|bioinorganic]] iron source is shown to confer benefits to young children (two years onwards) by improving growth, motor, and cognitive functions.<ref>{{citation|last=Hambidge |first=K Michael |last2=Sheng |first2=Xiaoyang |last3=Mazariegos |first3=Manolo |last4=Jiang |first4=Tianjiang |last5=Garces |first5=Ana |last6=Li |first6=Dinghua |last7=Westcott |first7=Jamie |last8=Tshefu |first8=Antoinette |last9=Sami |first9=Neelofar |last10=Pasha |first10=Omrana |last11=Chomba |first11=Elwyn |last12=Lokangaka |first12=Adrien |last13=Goco |first13=Norman |last14=Manasyan |first14=Albert |last15=Wright |first15=Linda L |last16=Koso-Thomas |first16=Marion |last17=Bose |first17=Carl |last18=Goldenberg |first18=Robert L |last19=Carlo |first19=Waldemar A |last20=McClure |first20=Elizabeth M  |last21=Krebs |first21=Nancy F  |title=Evaluation of meat as a first complementary food for breastfed infants: impact on iron intake|journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=69 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Inc |pages=S57-S63|year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00434.x}}</ref> In earlier times, premastication was an important practice that prevented infant iron deficiency.<ref>{{citation |title=Iron Interventions for Women and Children in Low-Income Countries |first=Rebecca J. |last=Stoltzfus |publisher=Journal of Nutrition |year=2011 |volume=141 |number=4 |pages=756S-762S |doi=10.3945/jn.110.128793}}</ref>

Meats provide [[Heme]] iron that are more easily absorbed by human physiology and higher in [[bioavailability]] than non-heme irons sources,<ref>{{citation |year=2010 |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |title=Iron bioavailability and dietary reference values |first=Richard |last=Hurrell |first2=Ines |last2=Egli |volume=91 |number=5 |pages=1461S-1467S |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/5/1461S.long}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Iron |date=August 24, 2007|publisher=National Institute of Health, USA|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/}}</ref> and is a recommended source of iron for infants.<ref>{{citation |date=April 3, 1998 |volume=47 |number=RR-3 |pages=1–36 |title=Recommendations to Prevent and Control Iron Deficiency in the United States |journal= CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/iron.html}}</ref>

====Anti-allergy and immunological benefits====
The infant can benefit from immunological resistance to infections and immunological hypersensitivity such as asthma can be inhibited through the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, growth factors, and nutrient transporters in the mother's saliva.<ref name=Pelto/>

Premastication may itself promote the development of infant immune systems through [[antigen|antibody generators]] in the mother's saliva, which help prevent the development of allergies in the infant.<ref name=comments/> Early infant feeding of premasticated foods such as eggs and nuts alongside breastfeeding, could help promote immune tolerance help moderate [[allergy|allergic]] responses. The practice of premastication is postulated to play an important role in the development of oral [[Immune tolerance|immunotolerance]] and help prevent the occurrence of autoimmune diseases in the infant. Although the rise in allergic and autoimmune diseases in Western societies have not been directly linked to the decrease of premastication in these same societies, researchers believe that these two phenomena are related.<ref name=comments/><ref>{{citation |title=An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases |first=Moises |last=Velasquez-Manoff |publisher=Simon and Schuster |date=Sep 4, 2012}}</ref>

====Parental enzymes====
Premasticated foods allow for better infant digestion through the presence of saliva enzymes lacking in infants.<ref name=Pelto/> [[Alpha-amylase]] from maternal saliva aids in digestion of [[starch]]es fed to a baby. This may be important in the developed nations since "...[[Infant formula|milk supplements]] containing starch are used frequently and if these are introduced into feeds at an early stage, digestion of the starch will require the action of salivary amylase..."<ref>{{citation |last=Butterworth |first=Peter J. |last2=Warren |first2=Frederick J.  |last3=Ellis |first3=Peter R. |title=Human α-amylase and starch digestion: An interesting marriage |journal=Starch - Stärke |volume=63 |number=7 |publisher=WILEY-VCH Verlag |doi=10.1002/star.201000150 |pages=395–405 |year=2011}}</ref> Children being fed mainly plant based diets by [[vegetarian]] parents also benefit from the more prevalent and different types of digestive enzymes in premasticated food.<ref>{{citation |first=Mark |last=Sisson |title=Should You Chew Your Child’s Food? |url=http://www.marksdailyapple.com/should-you-chew-your-childs-food |date=April 2012 |journal=Mark's Daily Apple }}</ref> Fat digesting [[lingual lipase]] in adult saliva can also help infant digestion and fat absorption since infants generally do not produce enough of these enzymes in their digestive tracts to efficiently process the fats they consume.<ref>{{citation |title=Gastrointestinal Oncology |chapter=Developmental biology of the gastrointestinal tract |first=Mark W. |last=Babyatsky |editor=James L. Abbruzzese |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004}}</ref>

===Disadvantages===

====Transmission of diseases====
Premastication can transmit a wide range of diseases and pathogens from infected parents to their infants through the parents' saliva and open [[mouth ulcer]]s, including [[HIV-AIDS]] as well as possibly [[hepatitis B]] virus, [[Helicobacter pylori]].<ref name=JL>{{citation |last=Levison |first=Judy |last2=Gillespie |first2=Susan L. |last3=Montgomery |first3=Elizabeth |title=Think twice before recommending pre-masticated food as a source of infant nutrition |journal=Maternal & Child Nutrition |volume=7 |number=1 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |pages=104 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-8709.2010.00289.x}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Pre-Chewed Baby Food Said to Transmit H.I.V. |first=Lawrence K. |last=Altman |date=2008-02-07 |journal=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/us/07hiv.html}}</ref> Given that the prevalence of HIV in population of lower-income and poorer nation-states who practice premastication extensively, the practice is likely an important method for transmission of the virus in their populations.<ref name=JL/>

Some state that since most mothers in the West will already know if they are carrying HIV or other serious infectious agents, mothers exercising caution who wish to breastfeed or premasticate for their children should not be dissuaded by experts who use science to justify their own personal disapproval.<ref>{{citation |first=Noah |last=Gray |title= Is Pre-mastication Dangerous for Baby?

====Establishment of cavity causing bacteria====
[[Dental caries]] causing bacteria from the mother's [[oral ecology]] can be transmitted to the infant through the saliva, resulting in bacterial colonization and a strong predisposition to tooth decay in the child.<ref>{{citation |title=Mom's kiss can spread cavities to baby |first=Mapes |last=Diane |journal=NBC News |date=March 30, 2010 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35989527/ns/health-oral_health/t/moms-kiss-can-spread-cavities-baby/#.UR7Q95GcGfj}}</ref><ref>{{citation |journal=Pediatric Dentistry |year=2008 |month=Sep-Oct |volume=30 |number=5 |pages=375–87 |title=Association of mutans streptococci between caregivers and their children. |last=Douglass |first=JM |last2=Li |first2=Y |last3=Tinanoff |first3=N.}}</ref>
