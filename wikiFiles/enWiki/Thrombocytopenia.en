The terms '''thrombocytopenia''' and '''thrombopenia''' refer to a relative decrease of [[platelets]] in [[blood]].

A normal human platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microlitre of blood.<ref name="lto">{{cite web

==Signs and symptoms==
Often, low platelet levels do not lead to clinical problems; rather, they are picked up on a routine [[complete blood count|full blood count]] (or complete blood count). Occasionally, there may be [[bruising]], particularly [[purpura]] in the forearms, [[petechia]] (pinpoint hemorrhages on skin and mucous membranes), [[nosebleed]]s and/or bleeding [[gums]].

Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not due to a secondary process. It is also important to ensure that the other blood cell types, such as [[red blood cells]] and [[white blood cells]], are not also suppressed.
Painless, round and pinpoint (1 to 3&nbsp;mm in diameter) petechiae usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form [[ecchymoses]]. Larger than petechiae, ecchymoses are purple, blue or yellow-green bruises that vary in size and shape. They can occur anywhere on the body.

A person with this disease may also complain of malaise, fatigue, and general weakness (with or without accompanying blood loss). In acquired thrombocytopenia, the patient's history may include the use of one or several offending drugs.

Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding (petechiae or ecchymoses), along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled bullae in the mouth. If the person's platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, spontaneous bruising will be seen (mostly on the arms and legs).

==Causes==
Decreased platelet counts can be due to a number of disease processes:

===Decreased production===

*[[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] or [[folic acid]] deficiency
*[[Leukemia]] or [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]
*Decreased production of [[thrombopoietin]] by the [[liver]] in [[liver failure]]
*[[Sepsis]], systemic [[virus|viral]] or [[bacterial infection]]
*[[Dengue fever]] can cause thrombocytopenia by direct infection of [[bone marrow]] [[megakaryocytes]], as well as immunological shortened [[platelet]] survival.
*Hereditary syndromes
**[[Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia]]
**[[Thrombocytopenia absent radius]] syndrome
**[[Fanconi anemia]]
**[[Bernard-Soulier syndrome]], associated with large platelets
**[[May-Hegglin anomaly]], the combination of thrombocytopenia, pale-blue leuckocyte inclusions, and [[giant platelet]]s
**[[Grey platelet syndrome]]
**[[Alport syndrome]]
**[[Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome]]

===Increased destruction===
*[[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]]
*[[Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]]
*[[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]
*[[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]
*[[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]
*[[Antiphospholipid syndrome]]
*[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]
*[[Post-transfusion purpura]]
*[[Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]]
*Splenic sequestration of platelets due to [[hypersplenism]]
*[[Dengue fever]] has been shown to cause shortened platelet survival and immunological platelet destruction.
*[[HIV-associated thrombocytopenia]]<ref name="pmid11914001">{{cite journal |pages=73–6 |doi=10.1054/blre.2001.0188 |title=HIV-related thrombocytopenia |year=2002 |last1=Scaradavou |first1=A |journal=Blood Reviews |volume=16 |pmid=11914001 |issue=1}}</ref>

===Medication-induced===
Thrombocytopenia-inducing medications include:
*Direct myelosuppression
**[[Valproic acid]]
**[[Methotrexate]]
**[[Carboplatin]]
**[[Interferon]]
**[[Isotretinoin]]
**[[Panobinostat]]
**Other [[chemotherapy]] drugs
**[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/Safety-RelatedDrugLabelingChanges/ucm117838.htm Singulair (montelukast sodium)]
**[[H2 blocker|H<sub>2</sub> blockers]] and [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s have shown increased thrombocytopenia symptoms, such as red dots near the bottom of the legs.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=758–61 |doi=10.1345/aph.1G384 |title=Pantoprazole-Induced Thrombocytopenia |year=2006 |last1=Watson |first1=T. D |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=40 |issue=4 |pmid=16569810 |last2=Stark |first2=JE |last3=Vesta |first3=KS}}</ref>

*Immunological platelet destruction
** A drug molecule binds to the [[Fragment antigen binding|Fab]] portion of an [[antibody]]: A classic example is the [[quinidine]] group of drugs. The Fc portion of the antibody molecule is not involved in the binding process.
** A drug molecule binds to the Fc antibody moiety, with the drug/antibody complex subsequently binding and activating the platelets: [[Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT) is a classic example, in which the heparin-antibody-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex binds to the Fc receptors on the surface of the platelet.  Since the Fc moiety is now unavailable to the Fc receptors of the reticuloendothelial cells, the normally occurring destruction of the platelets is prevented. This may explain why severe thrombocytopenia is not a common feature of HIT.
**[[Abciximab]]-induced thrombocytopenia.

===Comparing coagulation tests===
{{Bleeding worksheet}}

==Diagnosis==
Laboratory tests might include: [[full blood count]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[renal function]], [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] levels, [[folic acid]] levels, [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], and peripheral blood smear.

If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, a [[bone marrow biopsy]] is usually recommended, to differentiate whether the low platelet count is due to decreased production or peripheral destruction.

Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized alcoholics may be caused by [[splenomegaly]], [[folate deficiency]], and, most frequently, a direct toxic effect of alcohol on production, survival time, and function of platelets. Platelet count begins to rise after 2 to 5 days' abstinence from alcohol. The condition is generally benign, and clinically significant hemorrhage is rare.

Lab tests to determine the platelet count and clotting function may also be done. In severe thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow study can determine the number, size and maturity of the megakaryocytes (the bone marrow cells that release mature platelets). This information may identify ineffective platelet production as the cause of thrombocytopenia and rule out a malignant disease process at the same time.

==Treatment==
Treatment is guided by etiology and disease severity.  The main concept in treating thrombocytopenia is to eliminate the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing suspected drugs that cause thrombocytopenia, or treating underlying sepsis.  Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a [[hematologist]].

[[Corticosteroids]] may be used to increase platelet production. [[Lithium carbonate]] or folate may also be used to stimulate the bone marrow production of platelets. Platelet transfusions may be used to stop episodic abnormal bleeding caused by a low platelet count. However, if platelet destruction results from an immune disorder, platelet infusions may have only a minimal effect and may be reserved for life-threatening bleeding.

Specific treatment plans often depend on the underlying [[etiology]] of the thrombocytopenia.

| '''[[Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]]'''
| Treatment of [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] is a medical emergency, since the [[hemolytic anemia]] and platelet activation can lead to [[renal failure]] and changes in the level of consciousness.  Treatment of [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|TTP]] was revolutionized in the 1980s with the application of [[plasmapheresis]].  According to the [[Furlan-Tsai hypothesis]],<ref name=Furlan>{{cite journal |pages=437–54 |doi=10.1053/beha.2001.0142 |title=Aetiology and pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome: the role of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease |year=2001 |last1=Furlan |first1=M |last2=Lämmle |first2=Bernhard |journal=Best Practice & Research Clinical Haematology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pmid=11686108}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=1072–81 |doi=10.1097/01.ASN.0000060805.04118.4C |title=Advances in the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura |year=2003 |last1=Tsai |first1=H.-M. |journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pmid=12660343}}</ref> this treatment theoretically works by removing [[antibodies]] directed against the [[von Willebrand factor]] cleaving [[protease]], [[ADAMTS13|ADAMTS-13]].  The plasmapheresis procedure also adds active ADAMTS-13 protease [[proteins]] to the patient, restoring a more physiological state of von Willebrand factor multimers.  Patients with persistent antibodies against ADAMTS-13 do not always manifest TTP, and these antibodies alone are not sufficient to explain the how plasmapheresis treats TTP.
|-
| '''[[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]]'''
| Many cases of ITP can be left untreated, and spontaneous remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts of under 50,000 are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts of under 10,000 are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with a platelet count this low. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s, and [[hematologist]]s recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000&mdash;though there are documented exceptions to this observation.

Treatments for ITP include:
*[[Prednisone]] and other [[corticosteroids]]
*[[intravenous immunoglobulin|Intravenous immune globulin]]
*[[Splenectomy]]
*[[Danazol]]
*[[Eltrombopag]]
*[[Rituximab]]
*[[Romiplostim]]

Thrombopoetin analogues have been tested extensively for the treatment of ITP.  These agents had previously shown promise but had been found to stimulate antibodies against [[endogenous]] [[thrombopoietin]] or lead to [[thrombosis]].

Romiplostim (trade name Nplate, formerly AMG 531) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients, especially those who [[relapse]]d following splenectomy.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1672–81 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa054626 |title=AMG 531, a Thrombopoiesis-Stimulating Protein, for Chronic ITP |year=2006 |last1=Bussel |first1=James B. |last2=Kuter |first2=David J. |last3=George |first3=James N. |last4=McMillan |first4=Robert |last5=Aledort |first5=Louis M. |last6=Conklin |first6=George T. |last7=Lichtin |first7=Alan E. |last8=Lyons |first8=Roger M. |last9=Nieva |first9=Jorge |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=355 |issue=16 |pmid=17050891}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news

| '''[[Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]]'''
| Discontinuation of heparin is critical in a case of HITT.  Beyond that, however, clinicians generally treat to avoid a thrombosis, and patients started directly on [[warfarin]] after a diagnosis of HITT are at excess risk of [[venous limb gangrene]].  For this reason, patients are usually treated with a type of [[blood thinner]] called a [[direct thrombin inhibitor]] such as [[lepirudin]] or [[argatroban]], which are approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).  Other [[blood thinners]] sometimes used in this setting that are not FDA-approved for treatment of HITT include [[bivalirudin]] and [[fondaparinux]].  [[Platelet transfusion]]s are not a routine component of the treatment of HITT, since thrombosis, not bleeding, is the usual associated problem in this illness.
|-
| '''[[Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia]]'''
| Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplant is the only thing that ultimately cures this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death until transplant is done, although this is not always the case.

==Neonatal thrombocytopenia==
Thrombocytopenia affects a few percent of newborns, and its prevalence in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) is high. Normally, its course is mild and it resolves without consequences. Most of the cases of thrombocytopenia affect preterm birth infants and are results of placental insufficiency and/or fetal hypoxia. The other causes are less frequent, e.g. alloimmune, genetic, autoimmune, infection, DIC.<ref name="pmid12937037">{{cite journal |pages=F359–64 |doi=10.1136/fn.88.5.F359 |title=Neonatal thrombocytopenia: causes and management |year=2003 |last1=Roberts |first1=I |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood - Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=88 |issue=5 |pmid=12937037 |last2=Murray |first2=NA |pmc=1721612}}</ref>
