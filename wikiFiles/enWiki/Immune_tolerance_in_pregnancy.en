'''[[Immune tolerance]] in [[pregnancy]]''' or '''gestational/maternal immune tolerance''' is the absence of a maternal [[immune response]] against the [[fetus]] and [[placenta]], which thus may be viewed as unusually successful [[allograft]]s, since they genetically differ from the mother.<ref name=clark>{{cite journal |author=Clark DA, Chaput A, Tutton D |title=Active suppression of host-vs-graft reaction in pregnant mice.

==Mechanisms==
===Placental mechanisms===
[[File:Placenta.svg|thumb|The [[placenta]] functions as an immunological barrier between the mother and the fetus.]]
The [[placenta]] functions as an immunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an [[Immune privilege|immunologically privileged site]]. For this purpose, it uses several mechanisms:
*It secretes [[Neurokinin B]] containing [[phosphocholine]] molecules. This is the same mechanism used by [[parasitic]] [[nematode]]s to avoid detection by the immune system of their [[host (biology)|host]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Placenta 'fools body's defences'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7081298.stm|date=2007-11-10|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>
*Also, there is presence of small lymphocytic suppressor cells in the fetus that inhibit maternal [[cytotoxic T cell]]s by inhibiting the response to [[interleukin 2]].<ref name=clark/>
* The placental trophoblast cells do not express the classical [[MHC class I]] isotypes [[HLA-A]] and [[HLA-B]], unlike most other cells in the body, and this absence is assumed to prevent destruction by maternal [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, which otherwise would recognize the fetal HLA-A and HLA-B molecules as foreign. On the other hand, they do express the atypical [[MHC class I]] isotypes [[HLA-E]] and [[HLA-G]], which is assumed to prevent destruction by maternal [[NK cells]], which otherwise destroy cells that do not express any [[MHC class I]].<ref name=creasy>Page 31 to 32 in: Maternal-Fetal Medicine : Principles and Practice. Editor: Robert K. Creasy, Robert Resnik, Jay D. Iams. ISBN 978-0-7216-0004-8 Published: September 2003</ref> However, trophoblast cells do express the rather typical [[HLA-C]].<ref name=creasy/>
*It forms a [[syncytium]] without any extracellular spaces between cells in order to limit the exchange of migratory immune cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother (something an [[epithelium]] will not do sufficiently, as certain blood cells are specialized to be able to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells). The fusion of the cells is apparently caused by [[viral fusion proteins]] from [[Endogenous_retrovirus#Endosymbiotic_ERVs_in_mammals|endosymbiotic endogenous retrovirus (ERV)]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mi S, Lee X, Li X, ''et al.'' |title=Syncytin is a captive retroviral envelope protein involved in human placental morphogenesis |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6771 |pages=785–9 |year=2000 |month=Feb |pmid=10693809 |doi=10.1038/35001608 }}
</ref> An [[immunoevasive]] action was the initial normal behavior of the viral protein, in order to avail for the virus to spread to other cells by simply merging them with the infected one. It is believed that the ancestors of modern [[vivipary|viviparous]] mammals evolved after an infection by this virus, enabling the fetus to better resist the immune system of the mother.<ref>{{cite journal

Still, the placenta does allow maternal [[IgG antibodies]] to pass to the fetus to protect it against infections. However, these antibodies do not target fetal cells, unless any fetal material has escaped across the placenta where it can come in contact with maternal [[B cell]]s and make those B cells start to produce antibodies against fetal targets. The mother does produce antibodies against foreign [[ABO blood types]], where the fetal blood cells are possible targets, but these preformed antibodies are usually of the [[IgM antibodies|IgM]] type,<ref name=barbreau>[http://www.freshpatents.com/Magnetic-immunodiagnostic-method-for-the-demonstration-of-antibody-antigen-complexes-especially-of-blood-groups-dt20091029ptan20090269776.php Magnetic immunodiagnostic method for the demonstration of antibody/antigen complexes especially of blood groups] Yves Barbreau, Olivier Boulet, Arnaud Boulet, Alexis Delanoe, Laurence Fauconnier, Fabien Herbert, Jean-Marc Pelosin, Laurent Soufflet.

Still, rarely, ABO incompatibility can give rise to IgG antibodies that cross the placenta, and are caused by sentitization of mothers (usually of blood type 0) to antigens in foods or bacteria.<ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec19/ch273/ch273b.html Merck manuals > Perinatal Anemia] Last full review/revision January 2010 by David A. Paul</ref>

===Other mechanisms===
Still, the placental barrier is not the sole means to evade the immune system, as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation, on the other side of the placental barrier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams Z, Zepf D, Longtine J, ''et al.'' |title=Foreign fetal cells persist in the maternal circulation |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 91|issue= 6|pages= 2593–5|year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18384774 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.02.008 |url=}}</ref>

The placenta does not block maternal [[IgG antibodies]], which thereby may pass through the human placenta, providing immune protection to the fetus against infectious diseases.

One model for the induction of tolerance during the very early stages of pregnancy is the [[Eutherian Fetoembryonic Defense System]] (eu-FEDS) hypothesis.<ref name="pmid11114593">{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000016812 |author=Clark GF, Dell A, Morris HR, Patankar MS, Easton RL |title=The species recognition system: a new corollary for the human fetoembryonic defense system hypothesis |journal=Cells Tissues Organs (Print) |volume=168 |issue=1-2 |pages=113–21 |year=2001 |pmid=11114593}}</ref> The basic premise of the eu-FEDS hypothesis is that both soluble and cell surface associated [[glycoproteins]], present in the reproductive system and expressed on [[gametes]], suppress any potential immune responses, and inhibit rejection of the fetus.<ref name="pmid11114593"/> The eu-FEDS model further suggests that specific [[carbohydrate]] sequences ([[oligosaccharides]]) are covalently linked to these immunosuppressive glycoproteins and act as “functional groups” that suppress the immune response. The major uterine and fetal glycoproteins that are associated with the eu-FEDS model in the human include [[alpha-fetoprotein]], [[CA125]], and glycodelin-A (also known as placental protein 14 (PP14)).  

[[Regulatory T cell]]s also likely play a role.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trowsdale J, Betz AG |title=Mother's little helpers: mechanisms of maternal-fetal tolerance |journal=Nat. Immunol. |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=241–6 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16482172 |doi=10.1038/ni1317}}</ref>

Also, a shift from [[cell-mediated immunity]] toward [[humoral immunity]] is believed to occur.<ref name=Jamieson>Jamieson DJ, Theiler RN, Rasmussen SA. Emerging infections and pregnancy. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006 Nov. Available from http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no11/06-0152.htm</ref>

==Insufficient tolerance==
Many cases of [[spontaneous abortion]] may be described in the same way as maternal [[transplant rejection]],<ref name=clark/> and a chronic insufficient tolerance may cause [[infertility]]. Other examples of insufficient immune tolerance in pregnancy are [[Rh disease]] and [[pre-eclampsia]]:

*'''[[Rh disease]]''' is caused by the mother producing [[Antibody|antibodies]] (including [[IgG antibodies]]) against the [[Rhesus blood group system|Rhesus D]] [[antigen]] on her baby's [[red blood cell]]s. It occurs if the mother is Rh negative and the baby is Rh positive, and a small amount of Rh positive blood from any previous pregnancy has entered the mother's circulation to make her produce IgG antibodies against the D antigen (Anti-D). Maternal IgG is able to pass through the [[placenta]] into the [[fetus]] and if the level of it is sufficient, it will cause destruction of D positive fetal red blood cells leading to development of [[Hemolytic Disease of the Fetal-Newborn]] (HDFN), also called ''Rh disease''. Generally HDFN becomes worse with each additional Rh incompatible pregnancy.

*One cause of '''[[pre-eclampsia]]''' is an abnormal immune response towards the placenta. There is substantial evidence for [[Pre-eclampsia#Exposure_to_partner.27s_semen|exposure to partner's semen as prevention for pre-eclampsia]], largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid.<ref name="Robertson">{{cite web | author= Sarah Robertson|  title=Research Goals --> Role of seminal fluid signalling in the female reproductive tract | url=http://health.adelaide.edu.au/og/people/robertsons.html}}</ref><ref name=SeminalPriming>{{cite journal | author=Sarah A. Robertson, John J. Bromfield, and Kelton P. Tremellen | title=Seminal ‘priming’ for protection from pre-eclampsia—a unifying hypothesis | journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 | year=2003 | doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4 | pmid=12896827}}</ref>

Pregnancies resulting from [[egg donation]], where the carrier is less genetically similar to the fetus than a biological mother, are associated with a higher incidence of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] and [[placental pathology]].<ref name=van-der-Hoorn2010/> The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in normal pregnancies, so it has been suggested that the higher frequency of some conditions in egg donation may be caused by reduced immune tolerance from the mother.<ref name=van-der-Hoorn2010>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq017}}</ref>

===Infertility and miscarriage===
Immunological responses could be the cause in many cases of infertility and miscarriage. Some immunological reasons that contribute to infertility are reproductive autoimmune failure syndrome, the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies, and [[antinuclear antibodies]]. 

Anti-phospholipid antibodies are targeted toward the phospholipids of the cell membrane. Studies have shown that antibodies against phosphatidylserine, phoshphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine target the pre-embryo. Antibodies against phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine are against the trophoblast.<ref name=Gronowski>{{cite |title=Handbook of Clinical Laboratory Testing During Pregnancy |last= Gronowski |first= Ann M |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BpcXSquuuY4C |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=1-58829-270-3 |year=2004 }}</ref>  These phospholipids are essential in the aiding the cells of the fetus to remain attached to the cells of the uterus with implantation. If a female has antibodies against these phospholipids, they will be destroyed through the immune response and ultimately the fetus will not be able to remain bound to the uterus. These antibodies also jeopardize the health of the uterus by altering the [[blood flow]] to the uterus.<ref name=Gronowski />

Antinuclear antibodies cause an inflammation in the uterus that does not allow it to be a suitable host for implantation of the embryo. [[Natural killer cell]]s misinterpret the fetal cells as [[Cancer|cancer cells]] and attack them. An individual that presents with reproductive autoimmune failure syndrome has unexplained infertility, [[endometriosis]], and repetitive miscarriages due to elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies circulating.<ref name=Gronowski/> Both the presence of anti-phospholipids antibodies and antinuclear antibodies have toxic effects on the implantation of embryos. This does not apply to anti-thyroid antibodies.  Elevated levels do not have a [[Toxicity|toxic effect]], but they are indicative of a risk of miscarriage. Elevated anti-thyroid antibodies act as a marker for females who have T-lymphocyte dysfunction because these levels indicate T cells that are secreting high levels of cytokines that induce inflammation in the uterine wall.<ref name=Gronowski/>

Still, there is currently no drug that has evidence of preventing miscarriage by inhibition of maternal immune responses; aspirin has no effect in this case.<ref>{{cite pmid|20335572}}</ref>

==Increased infectious susceptibility==
The immunologic changes in pregnancy alters the susceptibility to and severity of [[infectious diseases]]. For example, pregnancy may increase susceptibility to [[toxoplasmosis]] and [[listeriosis]] and may increase severity of illness and increase mortality rates from [[influenza]] and [[varicella]].<ref name=Jamieson/>

==Interspecific pregnancy==
If the mechanisms of rejection-immunity of the fetus could be elucidated, it could avail for [[interspecific pregnancy]], having, for example pigs carry human fetuses to term as an alternative to a human [[surrogate mother]]<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Darwin%27s+children-a020078742 Darwin's children] LeVay, Simon.
