'''Underarm hair''' (Sometimes called '''axillary hair''' or '''armpit hair''') is the [[hair]] in the [[underarm]] area (axilla).

== Development and function ==
Underarm hair, as human [[body hair]], normally starts to appear at the [[pubarche|beginning]] of [[puberty]], with growth usually completed by the end of the teen-age years. The evolutionary significance of human underarm hair is still debated.  It may naturally wick [[perspiration|sweat]] or other moisture away from the skin, aiding in maintaining good ventilation.  Colonization by odor-producing [[bacteria]] is thereby transferred away from the skin (see [[skin flora]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Paye|first1=Marc|last2=Maibach|first2=Howard I.|last3=Barel|first3=André O|title=Handbook of cosmetic science and technology|edition=3|year=2009|publisher=[[Informa Health Care]]|isbn=1-4200-6963-2|page=703}}</ref>

== Cultural attitudes ==
Today, it is more common in much of the Western world for women than men to shave their underarm hair regularly. The prevalence of this practice varies widely, though.  Religious reasons are sometimes cited; for example, in [[Islamic]] culture, both men and women remove underarm hair to meet religious guidelines of cleanliness.  Many [[swimming (sport)|competitive swimmers]] remove nearly all of their body hair, including their underarm hair, to make their bodies more streamlined during races. Many male [[bodybuilder]]s also remove their body hair for cosmetic purposes, as do many (but not all) [[model (person)|models]] in various kinds of [[erotica]].

Removal of underarm hair was part of a collection of hygienic or cosmetic practices recommended by [[Prophet Muhammad]] (570-632) as consistent with ''[[fitra]]'' for both men and women and has since usually been regarded as a requirement by most [[Muslim]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/002-smt.php#002.0502|title=Compendium of Islamic Texts|publisher=[[University of Southern California|USC]]|accessdate=24 March 2012}}{{dead|date=December 2012}}</ref>

[[Seneca the Younger]] suggests it was common practice in ancient Rome, contrary to [[leg hair]] removal: «One is, I believe, as faulty as the other: the one class are unreasonably elaborate, the other are unreasonably negligent; the former depilate the leg, the latter not even the armpit» ([[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 114|letter 114]]).

In the West, the practice began for cosmetic reasons around 1915 in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], when one or more magazines showed a woman in a dress with shaved underarms.{{cn|date=August 2012}} Regular [[shaving]] became feasible with the introduction of the [[safety razor]] at the beginning of the 20th century. While underarm [[shaving]] was quickly adopted in some [[English language|English]] speaking countries, especially in the US and [[Canada]], it did not become widespread in [[Europe]] until well after [[World War II]].{{cn|date=July 2012}}

== Underarm hair in art ==
In works of art, the underarm hair is usually removed; showing it is a mark of [[modernism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This contrasts to the depiction of [[pubic hair]] in art, which is rarely portrayed in works created in the [[Middle Ages]], increasingly common in [[Renaissance]] art, and quite frequent in modern times.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weekes|first=Ann Owens|year=1993|title=Students' Self-Image: Representations of Women in "High" Art and Popular Culture|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=13|issue=2|pages=32–38|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0270-7993%28199223%2F199324%2913%3A2%3C32%3ASSROWI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage}}</ref>
