'''Reflux nephropathy''', RN is a term applied when small and scarred kidneys (chronic [[pyelonephritis]], CPN) are associated with [[vesico-ureteric reflux]] (VUR). CPN being the most common cause, there are other causes including analgesic nephropathy and obstructive injury. Scarring is essential in developing RN and occurs almost during the first five years of life. The end results of RN are [[hypertension]], [[proteinuria]], CRF and eventually ESRD, [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]]. 

The term was introduced in 1973.<ref name="pmid9848795">{{cite journal |author=Dillon MJ, Goonasekera CD |title=Reflux nephropathy |journal=J. Am. Soc.

==Diagnosis==
It is diagnosed by micturating [[cystography]], scarring can of course be demonstrated by [[ultrasound]] or [[DMSA]]. 

==Incidence/prevalence==
There is a genetic predisposition, first-degree relatives have a great increase in the chance of VUR. 

The gene frequency is estimated to be 1:600. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children from 2 to 24 months presenting with a UTI should be investigated for VUR.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Treatment==
The aim of treatment is to reduce renal scarring. Those children with grade II or worse should receive low dose [[prophylactic]] [[antibiotic]]s ([[Nitrofurantoin]], [[trimethoprim]], [[cotrimoxazole]], [[cefalexin]] in those with CRF). Hypertension should be managed with [[ACE inhibitor]] or [[Angiotensin receptor blocker|ARBs]]. Other treatment modalities include surgery (endoscopic injection of collagen behind the intra-vesical ureter, ureteric re-implantation or lengthening of the submucosal ureteric tunnel) which has its protagonists.
