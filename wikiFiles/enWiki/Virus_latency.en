{{Viral life cycle}}
'''Virus latency''' (or '''viral latency''') is the ability of a [[pathogen]]ic [[virus]] to lie [[dormancy|dormant]] ([[:wikt:latent|latent]]) within a cell, denoted as the [[lysogenic]] part of the viral life cycle.  A latent viral infection is a type of persistent viral infection which is distinguished from a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] viral infection.  A latent infection is a phase in certain viruses' life cycles in which after initial infection, virus production ceases.  However, the virus genome is not fully eradicated.  The result of this is that the virus can reactivate and begin producing large amounts of viral progeny without the host being infected by new outside virus, denoted as the [[lytic]] part of the viral life cycle, and stays within the host indefinitely.<ref>N.J. Dimmock et al. "Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition." Blackwell Publishing, 2007.</ref> 

Virus latency is not to be confused with clinical latency during the [[incubation period]] when a virus is '''not''' dormant.

== Mechanisms ==

=== Episomal latency ===
Episomal latency refers to the use of genetic [[episome]]s during latency.  In this type, viral genes are floating in the [[cytoplasm]] or [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] as distinct objects, both as linear or [[intron|lariat]] structures.  Episomal latency is more vulnerable to [[ribozymes]] or host foreign gene degradation than provirus latency.  

One example is [[herpesviridae|Herpes Virus family, ''Herpesviridae'']], all of which establish latent infection.  Herpes virus include [[Varicella Zoster Virus|Chicken-pox virus]] and [[Herpes simplex virus]]es (HSV-1, HSV-2), all of which establish episomal latency in [[neurons]] and leave linear genetic material floating in the cytoplasm.<ref name="PMID16909907">{{cite journal | title=DNA Methylation: Development, Genetic Disease and Cancer | journal=Current topics in microbiology and immunology | year=2006 | author=Minarovits J

Advantages of episomal latency include the fact that the virus may not need to enter the nucleus, and hence may avoid [[ND10]] domains from activating [[interferon]] via that pathway.

Disadvantages include more exposure to cellular defenses, leading to possible degradation of viral gene via cellular [[enzymes]].<ref>Burton EA, Fink DJ, Glorioso JC. "Gene delivery using herpes simplex virus vectors." DNA Cell Biol. 2002 Dec;21(12):915-36. Review.</ref>

=== Proviral latency ===

A [[provirus]] is a virus genome that is integrated into the DNA of a host cell.

Advantages include automatic host cell division results in replication of the viruses gene, and the fact that it is near impossible to remove an integrated provirus from an infected cell without killing the [[Cell (biology)|cell]].<ref>Marcello A. "Latency: the hidden HIV-1 challenge." Retrovirology. 2006 Jan 16;3(1):7</ref>

Disadvantages include the need to enter the nucleus (and the need for packaging proteins that will allow for that) and increased difficulty in maintaining the latency.

=== Maintaining latency ===
Both proviral and episomal latency may require maintenance for continued infection and fidelity of viral genes.  Latency is generally maintained by viral genes expressed primarily during latency.  Expression of these ''latency-associated'' genes may function to keep the viral genome from being digested by cellular [[ribozymes]] or being found out by the [[immune system]].  Certain viral gene products (RNA transcripts such as non-coding RNAs and proteins) may also inhibit [[apoptosis]] or induce [[mitosis|cell growth and division]] to allow more copies of the infected cell to be produced.<ref>Divito S, Cherpes TL, Hendricks RL. "A triple entente: virus, neurons, and CD8+ T cells maintain HSV-1 latency." Immunol Res. 2006;36(1-3):119-26. Review.</ref>

An example of such a gene product is the ''[[HHV Latency Associated Transcript|Latency Associated Transcripts (LAT)]]'' in [[Herpes simplex virus]], which interfere with [[apoptosis]] by [[downregulate|downregulating]] a number of host factors, including [[Major Histocompatibility Complex]] (MHC) and inhibiting the apoptotic pathway.<ref>Carpenter D, Hsiang C, Brown DJ, Jin L, Osorio N, Benmohamed L, Jones C, Wechsler SL. "Stable cell lines expressing high levels of the herpes simplex virus type 1 LAT are refractory to caspase 3 activation and DNA laddering following cold shock induced apoptosis." Virology. 2007 Dec 5;369(1):12-8. Epub 2007 Aug 28.</ref>

A certain type of latency could be ascribed to the [[endogenous retrovirus]]es. These viruses have incorporated into the human genome in the distant past, and are now passed through reproduction.  Generally these types of viruses have become highly evolved, and have lost the expression of many gene products.<ref>Buzdin A. "Human-specific endogenous retroviruses." ScientificWorldJournal. 2007 Nov 26;7:1848-68.</ref> Some of the proteins expressed by these viruses have co-evolved with host cells to play important roles in normal processes.<ref>Hayashida K, Omagari K, Masuda JI, Kohno S. "An integrase of endogenous retrovirus is involved in maternal mitochondrial DNA inheritance of the human mammal." Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Dec 3</ref>

== Ramifications ==

While viral latency exhibits no active [[viral shedding]] nor causes any [[pathologies]] or [[symptom]]s, the virus is still able to reactivate via external activators (i.e. sunlight, stress) to cause an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] infection.  In the case of [[Herpes simplex virus]], which generally infects an individual for life, a serotype of the virus reactivates occasionally to cause [[cold sores]].  Although the sores are quickly resolved by the immune system, they may be a minor annoyance from time to time.  In the case of [[varicella zoster virus]], after an initial acute infection ([[chickenpox]]) the virus lies dormant until reactivated as [[herpes zoster]].

More serious ramifications of a latent infection could be the possibility of transforming the cell, and forcing the cell into [[cancer|uncontrolled cell division]].  This is a result of the random insertion of the viral genome into the hosts own gene and expression of host cellular growth factors for the benefit of the virus.  A famous event of this actually happening with [[gene therapy]] through the use of retroviral vectors is the [[Necker Hospital]] in [[Paris]], where 20 young boys received treatment for a genetic disorder, after which 5 developed [[leukemia]]-like syndromes .<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18688285</ref>

This is also seen with infections of the [[human papilloma virus]] in which [[Chronic (medicine)|persistent]] infection may lead to [[cervical cancer]] as a result of [[cellular transformation]].<ref>Wang XG, Revskaya E, Bryan RA, Strickler HD, Burk RD, Casadevall A, Dadachova E.

In the field of [[HIV]] research, proviral latency in specific long-lived cell types is the basis for the concept of one or more '''viral reservoirs''', referring to locations (cell types or tissues) characterized by persistence of latent virus.  Specifically, the presence of replication-competent HIV in resting CD4-positive T cells, allows this virus to persist for years without evolving despite prolonged exposure to antiretroviral drugs.<ref name="pmid11818490">{{cite journal |author=Blankson JN, Persaud D, Siliciano RF |title=The challenge of viral reservoirs in HIV-1 infection |journal=Annu.
