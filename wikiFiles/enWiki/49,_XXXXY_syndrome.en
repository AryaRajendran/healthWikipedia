'''49, XXXXY syndrome''' is an extremely rare, [[aneuploidy|aneuploidic]] [[sex chromosome|sex chromosomal]] abnormality; its frequency is approximately 1 out of 85,000 to 100,000 males.<ref name="what">[http://www.xxxxysyndrome.com/what_is___.htm What is XXXXY syndrome?] Retrieved March 26, 2008.</ref><ref name="pmid17062147">{{cite journal |author=Visootsak J, Graham JM |title=Klinefelter syndrome and other sex chromosomal aneuploidies |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=1 |issue= |pages=42 |year=2006 |pmid=17062147 |pmc=1634840 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-42 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/1//42}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
As its name indicates, a person with the syndrome has one [[Y chromosome]] and four [[X chromosomes]] on the 23rd pair, thus having 49 chromosomes rather than the normal 46. As is common with [[aneuploidy]] disorders, 49, XXXXY syndrome is often accompanied by [[mental retardation]]. It can be considered a form of [[Klinefelter syndrome]],<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=179}}</ref> or a variant of it.<ref name="what" />

It is genetic, but not hereditary. This means that while the genes of the parents cause the syndrome, there is a small chance of more than one child having the syndrome. The probability of inheriting the disease is about 1%.<ref name="user">[http://www.webspawner.com/users/49xxxxysyndrome/ Webspawner.com article on 49, XXXXY syndrome]. Retrieved 26 March 2008.</ref>

The individuals with this syndrome are males, but [[49, XXXXX]] also exists with similar characteristics as the female version.

==Effects==
Aneuploidy is often fatal, but in this case there is "X-inactivation" where the effect of the additional gene dosage due to the presence of extra X chromosomes is greatly reduced.<ref name="user" />

Much like [[Down syndrome]] the mental effects of 49, XXXXY Syndrome vary.  Impaired speech and behavioral problems are typical.<ref name="pmid17497714">{{cite journal |author=Visootsak J, Rosner B, Dykens E, Tartaglia N, Graham JM |title=Behavioral phenotype of sex chromosome aneuploidies: 48,XXYY, 48,XXXY, and 49,XXXXY |journal=Am.

Skeletal anomalies include:
*[[Genu valgus]]
*[[Pes cavus]]
*Fifth finger [[clinodactyly]]

The effects also include:
*[[Cleft palate]]
*[[Club feet]]
*Respiratory conditions
*Short or/and broad neck
*Low birth weight
*Hyperextensible joints
*Short stature
*Narrow shoulders
*Coarse features in older age
*[[Hypertelorism]]
*Epicanthal folds
*[[Prognathism]]
*[[Gynecomastia]] (rare)
*Muscular [[hypotonia]]
*[[Hypoplastic]] genitalia
*Cryptorchidism
*[[Congenital]] heart defects
*A very round face in infancy<ref name="user" />
