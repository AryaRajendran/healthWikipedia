Although papillary carcinoma has a propensity to invade [[lymphatics]], it is less likely to invade [[blood vessels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/282276-overview| title=Thyroid, Papillary Carcinoma|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15}}</ref> 
These kinds of tumors are most commonly unencapsulated, and they have a high tendency to metastasize locally to lymph nodes, which may produce cystic structures near the thyroid that are difficult to diagnose because of the paucity of malignant tissue.<ref name="The Thyroid and its Diseases">{{cite web|url=http://www.thyroidmanager.org/Chapter18/18-cause.htm| title=The Thyroid and its Diseases|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15}}</ref> Furthermore, papillary tumors may metastasize to the [[lungs]] and produce a few nodules or the lung fields may exhibit a [[snowflake]] appearance throughout. 

Other characteristics of the papillary carcinoma is that E.M. shows increased [[mitochondria]], increased RER, as well as increased apical microvilli. Moreover, papillary carcinomas have an indolent growth, and 40% of cases spread out of the capsule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pathology.vcu.edu/education/endocrine/endocrine/newthyroid/| title=Papillary Carcinomas|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Associated mutations===
[[Mutation]]s associated with papillary thyroid cancer are mainly two forms of [[chromosomal translocation]] and one form of [[point mutation]]. These alterations lead to activation of a common [[carcinogenesis|carcinogenic]] pathway - the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]]. 

Chromosomal translocations involving the [[RET proto-oncogene]] (encoding a [[tyrosine kinase receptor]] that plays essential roles in the development of [[neuroendocrine cell]]s) located on chromosome 10q11 occur in approximately a fifth of papillary thyroid cancers. The fusion [[oncoprotein]]s generated are termed RET/PTC proteins (ret/papillary thyroid carcinoma), and constitutively activate RET and the downstream MAPK/ERK pathway.<ref name=Kumar20/> The frequency of ret/PTC translocations is significantly higher in papillary cancers arising in children and after radiation exposure.<ref name="Kumar20"/> The gene [[NTRK1]] (encoding the [[TrkA receptor]]), located on chromosome 1q, is similarly translocated in approximately 5% to 10% of papillary thyroid cancers.<ref name=Kumar20/>

Approximately a third to a half of papillary thyroid carcinomas harbor point mutations in the [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF oncogene]], also activating the MAPK/ERK pathway.<ref name=Kumar20/> In those cases the BRAF mutations found were V600E mutation. After performing a multivariate analysis, it was found that the absence of tumor capsule was the only parameter associated (P=0.0005) with BRAF V600E mutation.<ref name="The Thyroid and its Diseases"/> According to recent studies, papillary cancers carrying the common V600E mutation tend to have a more aggressive long term course. BRAF mutations are frequent in papillary carcinoma and in undifferentiated cancers that have developed from papillary tumors.

==Diagnosis==
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is usually discovered on routine examination as an [[asymptomatic]] thyroid nodule that appears as a neck mass. In some instances, the mass may have produced local symptoms. This mass is normally referred to a [[Needle aspiration biopsy|fine needle aspiration biopsy]] (FNA) for investigation. FNA accuracy is very high and it is a process widely used in these cases. Other investigation methods include [[ultrasound imaging]] and nuclear scan. The ultrasound is a useful test to distinguish solid from cystic lesions and to identify calcifications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3725/is_200607/ai_n16598095/|title=Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: An Overview|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15 | work=Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine | year=2006}}</ref> The thyroid ultrasound is also very effective to discover microcarcinomas, which refer to very small carcinomas (<1&nbsp;cm). 

Papillary thyroid carcinomas are also discovered when a hard nodule is found in multinodular [[goiter]], when enlarged cervical lymph nodes are detected, or when there are unidentified metastatic lesions elsewhere in the body.<ref name="The Thyroid and its Diseases"/> Expanding lesions found in the thyroid gland, especially if they are painful, should be examined as they may indicate the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Other clinical signs that could indicate papillary thyroid are: fixation to the trachea, stony hardness, damage to recurrent [[Laryngeal nerves|laryngeal]] or cervical [[sympathetic nerves]]. Seventy five percent of the population will have these thyroid nodules, and the majority will always be benign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papillarycarcinoma.net/| title=Papillary Carcinoma Prognosis|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15}}</ref> 

Chest [[x rays]] are not commonly performed. In cases of metastasis, some other tests are run to obtain sufficient information before a surgery. Such tests include the ultrasound and [[MRI]] of the neck as well as the [[CAT scanning]]. Other options that have shown good results in identifying tumors or related outcomes are the use of [[thallium-201]] chloride, which helps identify metastatic tumor; [[gallium scan]], which is helpful to visualize lymphomas; I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ([[MIBG]]) which has proven useful in imaging MTC; Tc-MIBI, which has been effective in detecting deposits of metastatic thyroid cancer; [[PET scans]], which are also helpful for the imaging of metastatic disease. Chia ''et al.'' report that TSHR mRNA measured with FNA enhances the preoperative detection of cancer in patients with thyroid nodules, reducing unnecessary surgeries, and immediate postoperative levels can predict residual/metastatic disease.<ref name="The Thyroid and its Diseases"/> Suspected lung metastases and/or miliary aspects at x-ray or CT can be diagnosed by cytology on a [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] specimen.<ref name=Vermeer-Mens2006>{{cite pmid|17179115}} [http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/24/36/5788.full.pdf]</ref>

==Prognosis==
Depending on source, the overall [[5-year survival rate]] for papillary thyroid cancer is 96%<ref name=american>Numbers from National Cancer Database in the US, from [http://books.google.se/books?id=u1aFpF-EcgwC&pg=PA10 Page 10] in: {{cite book |author=F. Grünwald; Biersack, H. J.; Grںunwald, F. |title=Thyroid cancer |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=3-540-22309-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} (Note:Book also states that the 14% 10-year survival for anaplastic thyroid cancer was overestimated</ref> or 97%,<ref>Rounded up to nearest natural number from 96.7% as given by [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/282276-overview  eMedicine > Thyroid, Papillary Carcinoma] Author: Luigi Santacroce. Coauthors: Silvia Gagliardi and Andrew Scott Kennedy. Updated: Sep 28, 2010</ref> with a 10-year survival rate of 93%.<ref name=american/>

For a more specific prognosis for individual cases, there are at minimum 13 known scoring systems for prognosis; among the more often used are: 
* AGES - Age, Grade, Extent of disease, Size
* AMES - Age, Metastasis, Extent of disease, Size
* MACIS - Metastasis, Age at presentation, Completeness of surgical resection, Invasion (extrathyroidal), Size<ref name="titleNew York Thyroid Center: Prognosis Staging for Thyroid Cancer">{{cite web |url=http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/staging.html |title=New York Thyroid Center: Prognosis Staging for Thyroid Cancer |accessdate=2007-12-22 |work=}}</ref> (this is a modification of the AGES system). It is probably the most reliable staging method available.
* [[TNM staging]] - Tumor, node, metastasis. Remarkable about the TNM staging for (differentiated) thyroid carcinoma is that the scoring is different according to age.

===MAICS===
The MAICS system of estimating the prognosis of papillary thyroid cancer was developed by the [[Mayo Clinic]], and was based on careful evaluation of a large group of patients. It is probably the most reliable staging method available.<ref name=ny>[http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/staging.html New York Thyroid Center > Thyroid cancer > Prognosis staging] Retrieved on April 30, 2010</ref> 

It assigns scores to the main factors involved, and uses the sum of this score to calculate the prognosis:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!colspan=2| Factors<ref name=ny/> !! Score<ref name=ny/>
|-
|rowspan=2| Distant '''M'''etastasis: spread of the cancer to areas outside the neck || Yes || 3
|-
| No || 0
|-
|rowspan=2| '''A'''ge at the time the tumor was discovered || Less than 39 years || 3.1
|-
| Over 40 years || 0.08 x age
|-
|rowspan=2| '''I'''nvasion into surrounding areas of the neck as seen by the naked eye || Yes || 1
|-
| No || 0
|-
|rowspan=2| '''C'''ompleteness of surgical resection (or removal) of the tumor || Incomplete || 1
|-
| Complete || 0
|-
| '''S'''ize of the tumor || || 0.3 x size in cm
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sum of MAICS Score<ref name=ny/> !! 20 yr Survival<ref name=ny/>
|-
| < 6.0 || 99% 
|-
| 6.0 - 6.99 || 89% 
|-
| 7.0 - 7.99 || 56%
|-
| > 8.0 || 24%
|}

Most patients fall into the low risk category (MACIS score less than 6.0) and are cured of the cancer at the time of surgery.<ref name=ny/>

Children with multiple lung metastases and/or a miliary aspect still have an excellent long-term prognosis if given adequate treatment.<ref name=Vermeer-Mens2006/>

===Overall stage===
By overall [[cancer staging]] into stages I to IV, papillary thyroid cancer has a [[5-year survival rate]] of 100% for stages I and II, 93% for stage III and 51% for stage IV.<ref name=acc>[http://www.cancer.org/cancer/thyroidcancer/detailedguide/thyroid-cancer-survival-rates cancer.org > Thyroid Cancer] By the American Cancer Society. In turn citing: AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (7th ed).</ref>

==Treatment ==
Surgical treatment:
*Minimal disease (diameter up to 1.0 centimeters) - [[hemithyroidectomy]] (or unilateral lobectomy) and [[isthmectomy]] may be sufficient. There is some discussion whether this is still preferable over total thyroidectomy for this group of patients.
*Gross disease (diameter over 1.0 centimeters) - total [[thyroidectomy]], and central compartment lymph node removal is the therapy of choice. Additional lateral neck nodes can be removed at the same time if an ultrasound guided FNA and thyrobulin TG cancer washing was positive on the pre-operative neck node ultrasound evaluation.

Arguments for total thyroidectomy are:
*Reduced risk of recurrence, if central compartment nodes are removed at the original surgery.
*Papillary carcinoma is a multifocal disease (hemithyroidectomy may leave disease in the other lobe)
*Ease of monitoring with thyroglobulin (sensitivity for picking up recurrence is increased in presence of total thyroidectomy, and ablation of remnant normal thyroid by low dose [[radioiodine]] 131 after following a low iodine diet (LID).
*Ease of detection of metastatic disease by thyroid and neck node ultrasound.
Thyroid total body scans are less reliable at finding recurrence than TG and ultrasound.

Papillary tumors tend to be more aggressive in patients over age 45. In such cases it might be required to perform a more extensive resection including portions of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Also, the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]], [[jugular vein]], and accessory nerve are to be removed if such procedure allows apparently complete tumor resection. If a significant amount of residual tumor is left in the [[neck]], external radiotherapy has been indicated and has proven useful especially in those cases when residual tumor does not take up radioiodine. 

After surgical thyroid removal, the patient waits around 4–6 weeks to then have radioiodine therapy. This therapy is intended to both detect and destroy any [[metastasis]] and residual tissue in the thyroid. The treatment may be repeated 6–12 months after initial treatment of metastatic disease where [[disease]] recurs or has not fully responded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/282276-treatment| title=Treatment|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15}}</ref> 

Patients are administered hormone replacement [[levothyroxine]] for life after surgery, especially after total thyroidectomy. [[Chemotherapy]] with [[cisplatin]] or [[doxorubicin]] has proven limited efficacy, however, it could be helpful for patients with [[bone metastases]] to improve their [[quality of life]]. Patients are also prescribed levothyroxine and radioiodine after surgery. Levothyroxine influences growth and maturation of tissues and it is involved in normal growth, [[metabolism]], and development. In case of metastases, patients are prescribed antineoplastic agents which inhibit [[cell growth]] and proliferation and help in palliating symptoms in progressive disease.  

After successful treatment, 35% of the patients may experience recurrence within a 40-year span. Also, patients may experience a high incidence of nodule metastasis, with 35% cases of cervical node metastases. Approximately 20% patients will develop multiple tumors within the thyroid gland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/oto/grand/12_04_03.htm| title=Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
