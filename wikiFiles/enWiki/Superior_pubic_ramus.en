The '''superior pubic ramus''' is a part of the [[pubic bone]] which forms a portion of the [[obturator foramen]].<ref name="urlDefinition: superior pubic ramus from Online Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?superior+pubic+ramus |title=Definition: superior pubic ramus from Online Medical Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref>

It extends from the body to the median plane where it articulates with its fellow of the opposite side. It is conveniently described in two portions, viz., a medial flattened part and a narrow lateral prismoid portion.

== Medial portion ==

The Medial Portion of the superior ramus, formerly described as the body of the pubis, is somewhat quadrilateral in shape, and presents for examination two surfaces and three borders.

===Surfaces===
The ''anterior surface'' is rough, directed downward and outward, and serves for the origin of various muscles. The [[Adductor longus]] arises from the upper and medial angle, immediately below the crest; lower down, the [[Obturator externus]], the [[Adductor brevis]], and the upper part of the [[Gracilis muscle|Gracilis]] take origin.

The ''posterior surface'', convex from above downward, concave from side to side, is smooth, and forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. It gives origin to the [[Levator ani]] and [[Obturator internus]], and attachment to the [[puboprostatic ligament]]s and to a few muscular fibers prolonged from the bladder.

===Borders===
The ''upper border'' presents a prominent tubercle, the [[pubic tubercle]] ([[pubic spine]]), which projects forward; the [[inferior crus]] of the [[subcutaneous inguinal ring]] (external abdominal ring), and the [[inguinal ligament]] (Poupart’s ligament) are attached to it.

Passing upward and laterally from the pubic tubercle is a well-defined ridge, forming a part of the [[Pectineal line (pubis)|pectineal line]] which marks the brim of the [[lesser pelvis]]: to it are attached a portion of the [[inguinal falx]] (conjoined tendon of Obliquus internus and Transversus), the [[lacunar ligament]] (Gimbernat’s ligament), and the [[reflected inguinal ligament]] (triangular fascia).

Medial to the pubic tubercle is the crest, which extends from this process to the medial end of the bone. It affords attachment to the [[inguinal falx]], and to the [[Rectus abdominis]] and [[Pyramidalis muscle|Pyramidalis]].

The point of junction of the crest with the medial border of the bone is called the angle; to it, as well as to the [[symphysis]], the [[superior crus]] of the subcutaneous inguinal ring is attached.

The ''medial border'' is articular; it is oval, and is marked by eight or nine transverse ridges, or a series of nipple-like processes arranged in rows, separated by grooves; they serve for the attachment of a thin layer of cartilage, which intervenes between it and the interpubic fibrocartilaginous lamina.

The ''lateral border'' presents a sharp margin, the obturator crest, which forms part of the circumference of the [[obturator foramen]] and affords attachment to the [[obturator membrane]].

== Lateral portion ==

The Lateral Portion of the ascending ramus has three surfaces: superior, inferior, and posterior. 

===Surfaces===
* The ''superior surface'' presents a continuation of the [[Pectineal line (pubis)|pectineal line]], already mentioned as commencing at the [[pubic tubercle]]. In front of this line, the surface of bone is triangular in form, wider laterally than medially, and is covered by the [[Pectineus]]. The surface is bounded, laterally, by a rough eminence, the [[iliopectineal eminence]], which serves to indicate the point of junction of the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], and below by a prominent ridge which extends from the [[acetabular notch]] to the pubic tubercle.

* The ''inferior surface'' forms the upper boundary of the [[obturator foramen]], and presents, laterally, a broad and deep, oblique groove, for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve; and medially, a sharp margin, the [[obturator crest]], forming part of the circumference of the obturator foramen, and giving attachment to the [[obturator membrane]].

* The ''posterior surface'' constitutes part of the anterior boundary of the [[lesser pelvis]]. It is smooth, convex from above downward, and affords origin to some fibers of the [[Obturator internus]].
