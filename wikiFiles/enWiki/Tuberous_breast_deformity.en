'''Tuberous breasts''' (or tubular breasts) are a result of a [[congenital abnormality]]<ref name="pmid18752021">{{cite journal |author=Panchapakesan V, Brown MH |title=Management of tuberous breast "deformity" with anatomic cohesive silicone gel breast implants |journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=49–53 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18752021 |doi=10.1007/s00266-008-9234-7 |url=}}</ref> of the breasts which can occur in both men and women (also see [[Hypoplasia]]). During [[puberty]] breast development is stymied and the breasts fail to develop normally and fully. The exact cause of this is as yet unclear. The condition is thought to affect one to five per cent of breast augmentation patients.<ref name="urlBreast Augmentation...on Tubular Breasts">{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmeticsurgery.com/articles/archive/an~228/ |title=Breast Augmentation...on Tubular Breasts |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref>

==Synonyms==
This condition is also known as constricted breasts, tubular breasts.

==Physical effects==
Tuberous breasts are not simply small or underdeveloped breasts. The effect of the condition on the appearance of the breast can range from mild to severe, and typical characteristics include: enlarged, puffy [[areola]], unusually wide spacing between the breasts, minimal [[Breast|breast tissue]], sagging, higher than normal [[Infra-mammary_fold|breast fold]],<ref>[http://www.jromano.com/procedure-photographs/breast-enhancement/tubular-breast-correction www.jromano.com/procedure-photographs/breast-enhancement/tubular-breast-correction]</ref> and narrow base at the [[Thoracic cavity|chest wall]]. The condition can affect the ability of women to breastfeed as in some cases the breasts, including the milk glands, have not developed enough to produce [[breast milk]].<ref>[http://www.007b.com/breast_size_breastfeeding.php www.007b.com/breast_size_breastfeeding.php]</ref> However, other physical aspects of fertility and pregnancy are not affected by the condition.

==Treatment==

The appearance of tuberous breasts can potentially be changed through [[List of surgical procedures|surgical procedures]], including the [[tissue expansion]] method and [[breast implants]].<ref name="Hammond2008">{{cite book|author=Dennis C. Hammond|title=Atlas of Aesthetic Breast Surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DCTqsrm9-r8C&pg=PA187|accessdate=2 May 2010|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4160-3184-0|pages=187–}}</ref>

The procedure to change the appearance of tuberous breasts can be more complicated than a regular breast augmentation, and some [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeons]] have specialist training in tuberous breast correction. As tuberous breasts are a [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformity]], referral for treatment under the [[National Health Service]] may be possible in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/pdf/plasticsreferralpolicy.pdf www.royalfree.nhs.uk/pdf/plasticsreferralpolicy.pdf]</ref> A starting point for those seeking such a referral may be a visit to their local [[General Practitioner]]. For those seeking non-surgical solutions, [[counseling]] may be recommended as a way of coming to terms with [[body image]].
