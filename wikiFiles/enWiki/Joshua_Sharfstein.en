==Life and career==
A native of Maryland, Sharfstein graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1991. In the fall of 1992, he entered [[Harvard Medical School]],<ref name=Torreyetal1992>{{citation |year=1992 |author=Torrey, E. Fuller |authorlink=E.

He did his residency in pediatrics through a joint program at [[Boston Children's Hospital]] and [[Boston Medical Center]], completing a special [[pediatrics]] fellowship with [[Boston University]].

Sharfstein then left Boston for [[Washington, D. C.]], where he joined the Democratic staff of the House Government Reform Committee and served as health policy advisor to Congressman [[Henry A. Waxman]]. Among the issues he worked on were [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], oversight of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), tobacco, and public health.<ref>[http://www.baltimorehealth.org/commissioner.html Biography of Dr. Joshua Sharfstein--City of Baltimore]</ref>

After the election of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008, Sharfstein served as leader of the Obama transition team on the FDA. Since that time, media reports have indicated he is a finalist to become FDA commissioner in the new administration.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/17/AR2009021703177.html "Healthy Competition for Top FDA Post" ''Washington Post'' February 18, 2009]</ref> In 2009, He was appointed by President Obama as Principal Deputy Commissioner of the FDA.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CommissionersPage/ucm162062.htm</ref> 

Sharfstein, whose early work in politics included work for [[Public Citizen]]'s Health Watch, has been a frequent critic of drug industry marketing practices—going all the way back to his days in medical training. During his time as public health commissioner of Baltimore, he led the effort to restrict the marketing of pediatric cold remedies.

Sharfstein has also written articles criticizing the [[American Medical Association]] for its pattern of giving campaign contributions to political candidates that take stands the majority of physicians oppose. One of those articles focused on AMA donations to candidates and elected officials who have fought the regulation of tobacco—a position the medical community generally favors and that Sharfstein has advocated over the years.<ref name="blogs.wsj.com">[http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/11/who-is-joshua-sharfstein/ "Who is Joshua Sharfstein?" ''Wall Street Journal'' Health Blog]</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E6DA1E3EF935A35752C0A962958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/A/American%20Medical%20Association "A.M.A. Found to Donate More to Foes of Its Views" ''New York Times'', January 6, 1994]</ref>

Although Sharfstein's candidacy for a top FDA post raised concerns among some special interest groups—the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on an "Anybody But Sharfstein" memo placed in circulation, apparently at the behest of drug companies<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/18/advocates-for-new-fda-chief-overlook-independence-from-industry/ "Advocates for new FDA chief overlook independence from industry ''Wall Street Journal'' Health Blog]</ref>--he has also sided with the drug industry in the controversy over vaccine safety, warning that vaccines are an essential part of public health.

Both of Sharfstein's parents are physicians.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/politics/bal-te.sharfstein16dec16,0,5137442.story "Sharfstein is favorite son for FDA post," ''Baltimore Sun'']</ref> His father [[Steven Sharfstein]] is former President of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].<ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/>

After less than two years on the job, FDA deputy commissioner Josh Sharfstein left the agency to become the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene in Maryland.<ref>[http://www.pharmalot.com/2011/01/josh-sharfstein-to-resign-from-the-fda/]</ref>
