'''Life Alert Emergency Response, Inc.''' is a nationwide company, with headquarters in [[Encino, California]], which provides services that help the [[Old age|elderly]] contact emergency services. The company's system is based around a main unit and a small wireless help button that is worn on the user at all times.  Life Alert was founded by Isaac Shepher in 1987. Former Surgeon General Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]] appeared in commercials for Life Alert starting in 1992, stating that he wore one. He remained a spokesman for the company until his death in 2013.

== About the Life Alert service ==
Life Alert was founded by Isaac Shepher and it consists of a pendant-shaped device, worn on a necklace or wristband, and an automated dialer connected to a [[telephone line]]. When an elderly or handicapped person falls down and cannot get up, or has an emergency, such as a break-in, a telephone may be out of reach. To get quick assistance, the customer simply presses a button on the pendant. This activates the automated dialer and calls a company [[call center]]. The dialer then works as a speaker phone. At the other end is an [[dispatcher|emergency services dispatcher]] to alert the authorities to the customer's predicament.

The service is marketed as a way for seniors to continue living at home rather than move to a [[retirement home]] and is available nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/6/prweb405674.htm |title=Life Alert President and CEO Isaac Shepher Named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year 2006 Award Winner in the Greater Los Angeles Area |publisher=Prweb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref>

The phrase "[[I've fallen and I can't get up]]!" was originally [[trademark]]ed in September 1992 by LifeCall that went out of business in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=74108242 |title="I've fallen and I can't get up!" trademark info |publisher=Tarr.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref> In June 2007, it was registered as a trademark of Life Alert Emergency Response, Inc., which first used the slogan in its commercials in 1987.
