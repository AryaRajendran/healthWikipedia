'''Dogger Bank itch''' is a [[skin|cutaneous]] condition characterized by an [[eczema]]tous [[dermatitis]] caused by exposure to the [[sea chervil]], ''[[Alcyonidium diaphanum]]'', a seaweed-like animal colony.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|431}} The disease, common in fishermen who work in the [[North Sea]], has been recognized by the [[Danish Workman's Compensation Act]] since 1939.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bonnevie P. |year=1948 |title=Fisherman's 'Dogger Bank Itch' |journal=Acta Allergy |volume=1 |issue= |pages=40&ndash;46}}</ref>

==Historical aspects==

A medical case reported in 1957 tells of a fishing captain who worked in the Dogger Bank in the North Sea. The sea chervil, abundant in the area, frequently came up with the fishing nets and had to be thrown back into the water. After doing this repeatedly, the captain "developed an itching red eruption on the flexor aspects of the elbows and forearms which became moist, oozed serum, and spread to involve the backs of the hands, fingers and most of the arms within a few days." Although the [[rash]] disappeared after leaving the area, it reappeared with greater severity when he returned to the area and performed the same activities; this time the rash spread to his neck and face, and continued to ooze [[blood plasma|serum]] for two months.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Seville RH.|year=1957 |title= Dogger Bank itch &ndash; report of a case|journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=92&ndash;93}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==

The causative agent, ''A. diaphanum'' (older synonyms include ''A. gelatinosum''), is a member of the [[Bryozoa]] phylum, which consists of minute, [[sessility (limnology)|sessile]], filter-feeding animals that live in colonies. ''A. diaphanum'' is a gelatinous, smooth, sponge-like colony up to 15&ndash;30&nbsp;cm long, growing on rocks and shells from lower shore down to approximately 100&nbsp;m; superficially, they resemble seaweed.<ref name=Bowers2001>{{cite journal |last= Bowers PW, Julian CG. |year=2001 |title=Dogger Bank Itch and cyclosporin |journal=Journal of Dermatological Treatment |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23&ndash;24 |doi= 10.1080/095466301750163536 |pmid= 12171683 |first1= PW |last2= Julian |first2= CG}}</ref> The distribution of this animal is from the North Sea to the Mediterranean.

The disease is especially prevalent among [[fishing trawler|trawlermen]] working in the [[Dogger Bank]], an important fishing bank in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=Carle1982>{{cite journal |last= Carle JS, Christophersen C.|year=1982 |title=Dogger Bank Itch. 4. an eczema-causing sulfoxonium ion from the marine animal, ''Alcyonidium gelatinosum'' |journal=Toxicon |first2= C |volume=20 |last2= Christophersen |issue=1 |pages=307&ndash;10 |doi= 10.1016/0041-0101(82)90232-X |first1= J |pmid=6210974}}</ref> It has also been reported in from the [[Baie de la Seine]] in France.<ref name=Carle1982/>

==Etiology and pathogenesis==

The [[rash]] is caused by a type of cell-mediated [[hypersensitivity]] reaction; this type of hypersensitivity normally occurs in people who become sensitized while handling chemicals or repeatedly come into contact with  other low-weight molecular weight substances. Although in some instances several years may be required to develop sensitivity, this time period may vary greatly depending on the individual. With Dogger Bank itch, sensitivity is acquired after repeated handling of ''A. hirsutum'' that becomes entangled in the fishing nets.

The specific [[allergen]] responsible for the Dogger Bank itch was determined to be the chemical (2-hydroxyethyl) dimethylsulfoxonium ion.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Carle JS, Christophersen C.|year=1980 |title= Dogger Bank itch the allergen is 2-hydroxyethyldimethyl sulfonium ion|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=102 |issue=15 |pages=5107&ndash;108  |doi = 10.1021/ja00535a053 }}</ref> This compound, also isolated from the marine [[sponge]] ''Theonella'' aff.

==Treatment==
A report of two cases in 2001 suggests that the rash responds to treatment with oral [[ciclosporin]].<ref name=Bowers2001/> In these two cases, initial treatments with oral [[prednisolone]] and [[topical steroid]]s were ineffective.
