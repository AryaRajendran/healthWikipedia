The '''Australian Vaccination Network''' (AVN), formerly known as the '''Vaccination Awareness Network''', is an [[Australia]]n [[anti-vaccination]] lobby group<ref name="HCCCfinal" /> registered in [[New South Wales]]. The organisation has [[lobbying|lobbied]] against a variety of vaccination-related programs, downplayed the danger of childhood diseases such as [[measles]] and [[pertussis]], championed the cause of alleged vaccination victims, and promoted the use of [[alternative medicine]] such as [[homeopathy]] and [[chiropractic]]. 

The AVN has been described as a provider of "misleading, inaccurate, and deceptive" vaccination information by the [[New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission]] (HCCC)<ref name = HCCCfinal/> and has been heavily criticised by doctors and other experts on immunisation.<ref name = HCCClateline/>  The group has been called the "stronghold of the anti-vaccination movement" in Australia and is subject to widespread criticism from medical professionals, scientists and other proponents of vaccination.<ref name="smith">{{cite web

In a July 2010 ruling by the Health Care Complaints Commission analysing AVNs claims and activities stated that AVN "should include an appropriate statement in a prominent position on its website which states:
{{quotation|the Australian Vaccination Network's purpose is to provide information against vaccination in order to balance what it believes is the substantial amount of pro-vaccination information available elsewhere;<br />
the information should not be read as medical advice and;<br />
the decision about whether or not to vaccinate should be made in consultation with a health care provider.|[http://www.stopmeryldorey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/HCCC-Report.pdf HCCC findings] as advised to complainant Ken McLeod of StopMerylDorey.com}}

On 14 October 2010, the organisation's right to fund-raise was stripped from it by the [[New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing]], stating that its appeals had "not been conducted in good faith for charitable purposes".<ref name=olgr-gazette/><ref name=olgr-abc/>

The AVN appealed to the NSW Supreme Court against the HCCC and OLGR findings. In February 2012, the Court ruled that the HCCC did not have the power to investigate the particular complaints that had resulted in the public warning, however it dismissed the complaint relating to the fundraising ban.<ref name = SupCourt/>

In December 2012, the [[New South Wales Office of Fair Trading]] issued an order for the AVN to change its name within two months or be de-registered. The department described the AVN's name as being "misleading and a detriment to the community".<ref name="heraldsun1">

==Organisation==
The Australian Vaccination Network was formed in 1994 as the Vaccination Awareness Network by Meryl Dorey and a "group of parents and health professionals concerned about protecting the rights of Australians to make free and informed health choices." The group's mission statement says it "is dedicated to the idea that health can be achieved and maintained without the use of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines" and that it seeks to enable people to make informed health choices.<ref name="About">{{cite web|url=http://avn.org.au/library/index.php/about-the-avn.html|title=About the AVN|publisher=The Australian Vaccination Network|accessdate=13 November 2009}}</ref> 

The AVN was led by Meryl Dorey, saying she got involved after her eldest son was allegedly adversely affected by [[DPT vaccine|DPT]] and [[MMR vaccine]]s administered when he was a child. She announced in February 2010 she was resigning "and moving on to the next stage of my own personal development as mother, wife, activist and researcher", but held the position of President until 1 January 2013, when she was replaced by Mr Greg Beattie. Ms Dorey remains with the AVN as "Public Officer and spokesperson".<ref name="president change" /><ref name="Living Wisdom">[http://avn.org.au/nocompulsoryvaccination/?p=454 AVN to close its doors at the end of this month, 2 February 2010]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

The AVN is strongly against any form of compulsory vaccination,<ref name="ECM">{{cite news|title=To immunise or not to immunise|author=Rachel Moore|date=8 July 2009|page=14|work=[[Eastern Courier Messenger]]}}</ref> but Dorey disputes that the AVN is an anti-vaccine organisation.  "We don't believe we have the right to tell people whether or not to vaccinate", says Dorey who adds, "but neither does the government."<ref name="eye">{{cite news|title=Eye of the Needle|author=Amanda Watt|date=18 July 2009|work=[[QWeekend]]|page=12}}</ref>  She says AVN is just trying to fill "the information void" created by a pro-vaccine government and medical community that ignores negative information.<ref name="SMH" /> Dorey considers herself, "pro-information and pro-choice".<ref name="Sunrise interview">[http://www.ama.com.au/node/583 Sunrise Interview with Dr Trevor Mudge and Meryl Dorey], www.ama.com.au, 21 August 2002</ref> 

In 2009, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] described the AVN as the "stronghold of the anti-vaccination movement" in Australia.<ref name="Whooping" /> The [[New South Wales|NSW]] Northern Rivers region, where the AVN is located, has a childhood vaccination rate of only 70% compared to the national average of over 90%.<ref name="Maze1" />

The AVN is a privately funded organisation. Until October 2010, they were the holders of a charitable fundraising authority in NSW, however their authority to fundraise was revoked by the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing after an audit of the organisation.<ref name= olgr-gazette>{{Cite news

===Publications===
In addition to its website and associated blog AVN published a quarterly magazine called ''Informed Voice'', later renamed ''Living Wisdom'' and offered as a digital publication. Living Wisdom ceased publication in January 2013. The AVN's paid-for memberships formerly included a quarterly insert called ''Inside Edition'' which contained "12 pages of current news from around the world regarding vaccination".

===Beliefs===
The Australian Vaccination Network believes that vaccines contain a variety of toxic ingredients that have no place in the human body.<ref name="Whooping" /> The group argues that these toxins can cause [[autism]], [[ADHD]], brain damage, and cancer, among other serious side effects.<ref name="SMH">{{cite news|title=Vaccine fear campaign investigated|date=16 August 2009|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=27|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/vaccine-fear-campaign-investigated-20090815-elsg.html|accessdate=13 November 2009 | first=Louise | last=Hall| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091004202920/http://www.smh.com.au/national/vaccine-fear-campaign-investigated-20090815-elsg.html| archivedate= 4 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  In response to medical and scientific research that shows few side effects to most vaccines, Dorey argues that doctors are very hesitant to report adverse reactions and thus the data is highly skewed.<ref name="Maze1">{{cite episode|title=The Immunisation Maze Part 1|airdate=10 July 2007|network=[[ABC Radio National]]|series=Life Matters|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/stories/2007/1972255.htm}}</ref>  Vaccination expert [http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/people/academics/profiles/robertb2.php Professor Robert Booy] counters these claims.  He notes that while minor side effects such as soreness, swelling, and fever are not uncommon, no large scale scientific study has found evidence of more serious reactions.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Immunisation Maze Part 3|airdate=12 July 2007|network=[[ABC Radio National]]|series=Life Matters|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/stories/2007/1972255.htm}}</ref>

Former AVN president Meryl Dorey claimed that most doctors are not fully informed about vaccination research and that the medical community as a whole relies on "[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|selective evidence]]" to back its argument.<ref name="Whooping" /><ref name="prickley">{{cite news|title=A prickly debate|author=Tory Sheperd|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=6 November 2009|page=19}}</ref> She says there is a "very, very strong effort" by the government and mainstream medical community to suppress any information that may cause parents to question the safety of vaccines.<ref name="eye" />  Consequently, Dorey argues, doctors often don't adequately warn patients of potential vaccination risks.<ref name="Whooping" /> Several critics have pointed out that AVN itself is guilty of ignoring evidence not favourable to the anti-vaccination point of view<ref name="SMH" /><ref name="Whooping" /><ref name="prickley" /> and the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) found that the AVN routinely ignore information that is not favourable to its anti-vaccination position. The HCCC accused the AVN of deceptively removing selected parts of stories when they report on them, and the misrepresentation of the conclusions of reliable studies. Dorey countered that she was not guilty of selective reporting, and that she "simply quoted the sections that [she] felt were important".<ref name = HCCCfinal/>

The AVN has also questioned the effectiveness of vaccines.  While admitting that infection rates dropped dramatically in the twentieth century, they argue that the change is due in large part to improved hygiene and living conditions.<ref name="Maze2" /> Dorey has argued that infection rates were already on the decline before vaccines were invented<ref name="Maze2" /> and that effectiveness has "never been scientifically tested."<ref name="eye" /> She has stated that the "vast majority" of people who contract disease have previously been vaccinated.<ref name="ECM" />  [[Infectious disease]] [[medical specialist|specialist]] Paul Goldwater acknowledged a few vaccines are not completely effective, but said others were nearly 100% effective.  In all cases, he said, "the benefits certainly outweigh any risks."<ref name="ECM" />  AVN has also expressed doubts about the [[cost-benefit ratio]] and effectiveness of [[flu vaccine]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=High cost of kids with flu is avoidable, study shows|author=Sarah Price|date=30 July 2006|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-cost-of-kids-with-flu-is-avoidable-study-shows/2006/07/29/1153816423160.html|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>

Infectious disease specialist [http://www.health.usyd.edu.au/people/profiles/P.Mcintyre.php Professor Peter McIntyre] has accused the AVN of manipulating research and statistics in order to make its case. "It's been a real characteristic of the anti-vaccine movement ... [to claim] to be looking very extensively at the scientific evidence," says McIntyre, "[but their conclusions are] really a complete misinterpretation."<ref name="Whooping">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/03/2675448.htm|title=Whooping cough deaths spark vaccination debate|date=3 September 2009|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=13 November 2009}}</ref>  [[Paediatrician]] Chris Ingall says that the AVN's efforts are "negative, destructive and [have] no scientific basis."<ref name="Whooping" /> [[Australian Medical Association]] [[South Australia|SA]] state president [[Andrew Lavender]] states that groups like the AVN "[act] on very little information and ...

Dorey argues that scientific studies cannot be trusted because they are usually funded, she claims, by biomedicine and pharmaceutical companies that develop and manufacture vaccine products, and that doctors have "financial incentives" to push vaccines.<ref name="eye" />

==Activism==
The Australian Vaccination Network has regularly spoken out against vaccine-related positions adopted by the Australian government and defended controversial and discredited research.  AVN also distributes literature, sponsors seminars, and collects adverse reaction reports.

In a 1996 editorial, AVN spoke out against a proposal to add vaccination centres to some [[shopping mall|shopping centre]]s.  Writing on behalf of AVN, Susan Lindberg called the idea "downright dangerous," asking "what if a baby has a fit or major reaction?" She also added that parents are under enough pressure to vaccinate already.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jabs in the mall|author=Susan Lindberg|date=12 April 1996|work=The Australian}}</ref>

In response to a 2002 proposal to extend free vaccination programs, Former AVN president Meryl Dorey argued that the Australian government should first do independent tests of the new vaccines.  She said that she had doubts about the accuracy of the existing studies that were "funded ... by the pharmaceutical companies."<ref name="Toddler">{{cite news|title=Proposal to extend toddler vaccine program causes concern|date=7 June 2002|work=ABC News Online |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200206/s575750.htm|accessdate=2009-11-18}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>  A member of the government's immunisation advisory group countered that they always assess all available scientific data.<ref name="Toddler" />

In August 2004, AVN spoke out against combination vaccines being considered by health authorities.  The organisation claimed that there were too many untested variables and that it was irresponsible to keep combining vaccines without knowing the effects.<ref name="Multi">{{cite news|title=Fears over vaccine cocktail for babies|author=Cathy O'Leary|date=24 August 2004|work=[[The West Australian]]|page=1}}</ref> In 2006, Meryl Dorey continued the attack on combined vaccines, claiming it was un-natural, as ''"It is a fact that [humans] will only ever contract one disease at a time"''.<ref name = winter06/> According to the [[British Medical Journal]] combined vaccines have actually shown reduced side effects,<ref name="Multi" /> and it is quite common for humans to suffer simultaneously from several infections.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Adverse Reaction Reports===
In December 1996, AVN presented Federal Health Minister [[Michael Wooldridge]] with reports on 150 cases of children suspected of being injured by vaccines.  Dating back to 1991, Dorey claimed that the collection of previously unreported reactions represented the largest single collection ever presented to the Australian Government.<ref name="JustTheShot">{{cite news|title=Just The Shot|author=Megan James|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 December 1996|page=9}}</ref> Dorey states that many of the parents involved had previously tried to have their cases looked at, but had been told by health authorities their cases couldn't proceed because the parents lacked necessary documentation.<ref name="JustTheShot" />  Gavin Frost, a government vaccination adviser, said he supported increased medical reporting of vaccine side effects but doubted claims of permanent damaged caused by vaccines.<ref name="JustTheShot" />  AVN has continued to collect adverse reaction reports and claimed to have more than 800 documented cases of severe reactions as of March 2006, equating to an average of six reports every month.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Reasons why parents question vaccination|publisher=The Australian Vaccination Network|url=http://avn.org.au/library/index.php/vaccination-information/10-reasons-why-parents-question-vaccination.html|date=1 March 2006|accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref> However, a published government report shows that over the 33-month period from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2002, the AVN made a total of 11 unspecified adverse event reports, which equates to approximately one report every three months.<ref>{{cite web

===Views on vaccination incentives===
In May 2000, Meryl Dorey spoke out against a government initiative that cut child care payments for 9000 families who failed to get their children vaccinated.

On 24 May 2010, immediately following the [[Struck off|striking-off]] of Mr. Wakefield by the British [[General Medical Council]] for "gross misconduct" and "bringing the medical profession into disrepute", the AVN continued to support him, issuing the following statement: ''"Dr Wakefield knows that he has the love and respect of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of parents around the world.

===Campaign against the Meningococcal vaccine===
The AVN campaigned against the introduction of a [[meningococcal vaccine]] to Australia in 2002. Meryl Dorey accused the Government of wasting {{AUD}}41 million on the vaccination program, stated that the vaccine had shown a large number of adverse reactions in the [[United Kingdom]] and had never been tested for effectiveness. However the vice-president of the AMA, Dr. Trevor Mudge, refuted her claims, pointing out that [[meningococcal disease]] is extremely dangerous and that "Vaccination really is the only strategy for this condition that is likely to work". He said the vaccine had been extensively tested and contrary to Dorey's claims had been found to be safe and highly effective in the UK.<ref name="Sunrise interview"/><ref>{{Cite journal

===Campaign against the Pertussis (Whooping Cough) vaccine===
Following the death of four-week-old [http://www.danamccaffery.com/ Dana McCaffery] from [[Pertussis|Pertussis (Whooping Cough)]] in March 2009, and the subsequent Government campaigns to improve pertussis immunisation, the AVN launched a campaign against the pertussis vaccine. 

The day after Dana's death was reported in a local newspaper, the AVN's Meryl Dorey contacted the Director of Public Health for the NSW North Coast, Mr Paul Corben, disputing that Dana had died from Pertussis and demanding he provide confidential details of her death, including personal medical records and the results of diagnosing tests. Corben refused to release the information, citing privacy legislation. He later wrote to the McCafferys that the AVN's "callousness and disregard for you and your family is chilling indeed".<ref name=panic>{{Cite book

AVN members continued to harass the McCafferys through to July 2010 by sending emails, letters and AVN brochures to the family. Former AVN president Meryl Dorey wrote another blog disputing the McCafferys' version of events, the treatments and effects Dana suffered and the diagnosis of Pertussis. Dana's mother was forced to publicly defend the facts of the case again, pleading to be left alone by Meryl and other AVN members.<ref name=letter>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/75952629/Toni-McCaffery-s-Response-to-AVN-Article-A-Grieving-Family-and-Baseless-Accusations Toni McCaffery's Response to AVN article A grieving family and baseless accusations.]</ref> In a subsequent television interview for ABC [[Lateline]], Dorey admitted she had accused the McCafferys of "turning their daughter into a martyr because she supposedly died of whooping cough".<ref name = HCCClateline/>

The AVN's public campaign against the Pertussis vaccine began with an article in the May 2009 issue of ''Living Wisdom'' written by Meryl Dorey, which questioned the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and the dangers of Whooping Cough itself. Critics pointed out that Dorey's article contained numerous errors of fact and omission.<ref name="FearFactor"/> While the article correctly stated that [[Sweden]] had previously withdrawn Pertussis vaccination in 1979 due to research showing it was ineffective, she failed to reveal that the vaccine then used in Sweden was different to the effective vaccine used in other countries such as Australia,<ref>{{cite web

===Anti-Vaccination Seminars and Public Talks===
In May 2010 the AVN announced that they would be hosting a seminar in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], to be held at the [[Uniting Church]] In The City (UCIC) on 14 May. However following a campaign by members of the Church, the medical community and members of the ''Stop the AVN'' group, the Church announced that they would not allow the AVN to use their premises for the seminar, as they were "concerned that there may be a public perception that the UCIC does not support childhood vaccinations due to the AVN seminar being held at UCIC's rooms".<ref>{{Cite press release

==Complaints, Investigations and Criticisms==
The AVN has been the subject of several complaints to (and investigations by) Government departments and medical authorities. Medical professionals, scientists and other proponents of vaccination are highly critical of the AVN.

===NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC)===
In August 2009, Ken McLeod filed a complaint against AVN with the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission.<ref name="SMH"/> The complaint, which was supported by the group ''[[Australian Skeptics]]'', said that the organisation was in breach of the Health Care Complaints Act because it made "unsubstantiated health claims based on 'conspiracy theories', pseudo-scientific evidence and debunked research." The complaint was also supported by Australian entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]].<ref name="Time Brunero">{{cite news|title=Dick Smith pushes immunisation|work =[[Macquarie National News]]|author=Time Brunero|date=6 August 2009}}</ref>

In response to the complaint, the AVN submitted a 27-page document which argued that they are not actively providing health care service and therefore are not under the jurisdiction of the Health Care Complaints Commission.<ref>{{cite web| title=AVN e-newsletter, October 2008| url=http://www.antivaxxers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/avn_hccc_amended.pdf | last= Dorey|first= Meryl |format=PDF}}</ref> The submission also listed extensive references they claimed supported their views on adverse events and links between vaccination and various disorders, which they state is "sourced from peer-reviewed medical journals".<ref>{{cite web

Tom Sidwell, a [[Monash University]] [[Immunology]] student, conducted a review of the sources and information provided in the AVN's HCCC reply. He submitted to the HCCC that all of the sources quoted by Dorey in the reply were either not from [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals as Dorey had claimed, or did not actually support the conclusions she was attributing to them.<ref>{{cite web

====HCCC Ruling====
The HCCC concluded their investigation into the AVN in July 2010. The Commission determined that "the health education service provided by the Australian Vaccination Network on its website provides misleading and inaccurate information on the subject of vaccination".<ref name = HCCCfinal/>

In addition, the Commission found that the AVN "misleads readers by using reliable and peer-reviewed research, but quoting selectively from it, often in contradiction to the conclusions or findings of the studies themselves".<ref name = HCCCfinal/>

The Commission ordered the AVN to permanently place the following information in a prominent place on their website within 14 days:

* The Australian Vaccination Network’s purpose is to provide information against vaccination in order to balance what it believes is the substantial amount of pro-vaccination information available elsewhere;
* The information provided should not be read as medical advice; and
* The decision about whether or not to vaccinate should be made in consultation with a health care provider.<ref name = HCCCfinal/>

Following the AVN's refusal to display the notice, on 26 July 2010 the HCCC issued a public warning about the group stating
: '''''"The AVN’s failure to include a notice on its website of the nature recommended by the Commission may result in members of the public making improperly informed decisions about whether or not to vaccinate, and therefore poses a risk to public health and safety."'''''<ref>{{Cite press release

  | accessdate = 26 July 2010}}</ref>

The NSW HCCC's ruling was further supported by the Chief Medical Officer of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], who agreed that the AVN "should make it clear what their views are and if it's an extreme view about a certain topic it should be clear that it is their view and that they're not speaking on behalf of for example the medical profession".<ref>{{Cite episode

The AVN appealed the HCCC ruling to the NSW Supreme Court, arguing that the HCCC does not have jurisdiction over Meryl Dorey or the AVN.<ref name = HCCClateline>{{Cite episode

The court ruled that the AVN is a health care provider, and therefore the HCCC does have jurisdiction over their activities. However, it ruled that the original complaints to the HCCC about the AVN were invalid because the complaints did not include evidence that anyone had actually acted on the incorrect advice provided by the AVN. The court did not make a judgement about the validity of the complaints, nor the information contained within them.<ref name = SupCourt/>

===NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing investigation===
Following complaints that the AVN had been illegally fundraising without authority between 2 July 2007 and 2 June 2009, and a previous warning relating to the AVN being in breach of its fundraising authority conditions (as it did not have a "mechanism to properly and effectively deal with complaints relating to fundraising"), the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing (OLGR) announced in February 2010 that they would conduct a full audit of the groups fundraising activities.<ref name=olgr>{{cite news|title=Vaccination Network to be Audited|author=Mel Mcmillan|date=11 February 2010|work=The Northern Star|url=http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2010/02/11/anti-immunisers-needled/|accessdate=14 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100213015910/http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2010/02/11/anti-immunisers-needled/| archivedate= 13 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

====OLGR Ruling====
On 4 August 2010, the OLGR announced that their audit of the AVN had "detected a number of breaches of charity fund-raising laws", including:
* Fundraising without authority;
* Unauthorised expenditure;
* Failure to keep proper records of income and expenditure;
* Possible breaches of the ''Charitable Trust Act, 1993'',<ref>"[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/ Charitable Trust Act, 1993]" www.austlii.edu.au</ref> which would be referred to the Department of Justice and the Attorney General.

The AVN was given 28 days to respond to the findings. President Meryl Dorey declined to comment on the issue.<ref name = OLGRlateline>{{Cite episode

=====Revocation of Authority to Fundraise=====
On 14 October 2010, the Hon. Kevin Greene, M.P. revoked the AVN's authority to fundraise, meaning they are no longer permitted to conduct appeals or receive donations from members of the public.<ref name=olgr-gazette/><ref name=olgr-abc/> Reasons for the revocation were given as breaches of sections 31 (1) a, b and f of the ''Charitable Fundraising Act 1991'':
* Their fundraising appeals have not been conducted in good faith for charitable purposes;
* Their fundraising appeals have been improperly administered;
* Their fundraising activities are not in the public interest.

In response to the revocation, the AVN issued a media release criticising the OLGR's decision as being politically motivated, and difficult to understand given that the "revocation was based entirely upon the questionable decision by the HCCC", rather than upon "the simple errors" detected by the OLGR during their audit of the organisation. Dorey appealed for the public to make donations to the AVN before the revocation took effect on 20 October 2010.<ref name=olgr-avn>{{Cite press release

  | accessdate = 15 October 2010}}</ref>

=====Supreme Court appeal=====
As part of their appeal to the NSW Supreme Court in relation to the HCCC complaint, the AVN asked the court to invalidate the OLGR's revocation of their fundraising authority, asking them to grant [[certiorari]]. The court rejected the argument and the fundraising prohibition remained.<ref name = SupCourt/>

=== Department of Fair Trading name change order ===
In December 2012, the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading issued an order for the AVN to change its name within two months or be de-registered. The letter of action was delivered to the home of the organization's president, Meryl Dorey. It described the name as misleading and a detriment to the community. The Fair Trading Minister, Anthony Roberts, said that issue of vaccination was one of life and death and that the organization's activities endangered people's safety. Mr Roberts has warned other states against the AVN trying to register. Robert Vellar, the NSW Fair Trading Assistant Commissioner for Compliance and Enforcement, says the AVN's name has misled parents seeking information. Mr Vellar added that the NSW government intended to change definitions in the Associations Act to prevent groups from using names that were in conflict with their charter. The president of the AMA (NSW), Assoc Prof Brian Owler, said the AVN needed to take responsibility for information it gave to parents.<ref name="heraldsun1"/>

=== Apology to the Australian Medical Association ===

In March 2007, the AVN made certain erroneous comments on their website, including claims that the [[Australian Medical Association|AMA]] received funding from pharmaceutical companies and actively censored information provided to its members. These claims were factually incorrect, and the AMA took legal action against the AVN. The AVN withdrew the claims and issued a public apology on 21 March 2007. The apology read:

: "It has been brought to the attention of the Australian Vaccination Network that the comments published not only contained a number of factual errors but were felt to be offensive and embarassing [sic] to AMA (NSW), its officers and employees.

: "In particular it has been brought to the attention of the Australian Vaccination Network, the the [sic] Australian Vaccination Network accepts, that:
: 1- AMA (NSW) does not obtain any of its funding from pharmaceutical companies;
: 2- AMA (NSW) has not published any advertisement or advertorial for a pharmaceutical company in the NSW Doctor for a period of at least four years, and at no time has the advertising in NSW Doctor been almost exclusively that of pharmaceutical companies;
: 3- AMA (NSW) does not actively censor information made available to its members.

: "The Australian Vaccination Network unreservedly apologises for any offence or embarassment the publication may have caused AMA (NSW), its officers and employees."

===Australian Doctor Top 50 Medical Scandals===

The [[Australian Skeptics]] awarded their [[Bent Spoon Award]], ''"presented annually to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of [[paranormal]] or [[pseudoscientific]] piffle"'', to Meryl Dorey and the AVN in 2009, stating that the award had been earned through their "scaremongering and misinformation about childhood vaccination".

===Copyright complaints===
In September 2010, the AVN was accused of numerous copyright breaches relating to their sale of information packs containing photocopies of selected parts of old medical journal articles, newspaper reports and cartoons. After receiving complaints from authors and copyright holders, the AVN withdrew the packs from sale on their website. Several authors stated that they had not given permission for the AVN to reproduce the material and would seek payment for their past use. They also criticised the AVN's use of the articles as they were "old and not based on current information". Meryl Dorey stated that she was unaware that selling the articles was a breach of copyright.<ref>{{Cite news

===Criticisms===
In 2002 while speaking about low vaccination rates in the NSW Northern Rivers region, the Hon [[Brian Pezzutti|Dr Brian Pezzutti]] criticised Meryl Dorey in the NSW Legislative Council:
:''"only 60 per cent of children in the Byron Bay area in the 12 to 15 month age group—the very young and most vulnerable— are immunised. That is mainly because of the activities of a woman called Meryl Dorey, who lives in Byron Bay and who has decided not to immunise her children and who regularly claims that immunisation is not necessary. She campaigns against immunisation."'' <ref>{{Cite journal

Following the AVN's public objections to the Australian Government's 1998 [[Australian Measles Control Campaign]], the then Federal Health Minister Dr Michael Wooldridge issued a media release which was highly critical of the group, writing:
:''"I am deeply concerned that media organisations risk giving credibility to the crackpot views of the AVN by publishing, without question, their untrue and deceitful claims. Ultimately, young children who are particularly vulnerable to measles could suffer if their parents were influenced by the anti-science, irrational views of the AVN."''<ref name="wooldridge" />

Australian entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]], who had previously run a national ad in ''[[The Australian]]'' asking parents to ignore AVN's claims, has been highly critical of the organisation, stating:
: ''"They are actually anti-vaccination, and they should put on every bit of their material that they are anti-vaccination in great big words. They have every right for that belief but they should communicate it clearly so people are not misled."'' and
: ''"I think they're choosing not to vaccinate because they don't understand risk management - they are told that there is a risk with vaccination - now everything in life has a risk. There's a minute risk but it's been proved all over the world that the advantages far outweigh the risk."'' <ref name="smith" /><ref name="Time Brunero"/>

Following the AVN's decision to hold an anti-vaccination seminar at the Western Australian State Library, the Shadow Arts Minister John Hyde criticised the state Government for allowing the group to "push its anti-vaccine message", saying:
: ''"Why should a group that endangers the lives of WA children be allowed to speak and promote their cause at a taxpayer-funded venue dedicated to learning? Their dangerous propaganda which is putting children at risk of polio, smallpox, cholera and other preventable diseases should not be able to gain respectability by using the good name of the State Library"''.<ref name=Perth/>

During an interview on ABC Lateline in July 2010, the 1997 [[Australian of the Year]] and 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] laureate, immunologist [[Peter C. Doherty|Professor Peter Doherty]] described the AVN's attempts to reduce the child immunisation rate as a ''"Crime against Humanity"''.<ref name=HCCClateline/>

In a response to a parliamentary question about the AVN's statements regarding the [[MMR vaccine]], in September 2012 the NSW Minister for Health and Minister for Medical Research said:
: ''"The Australian Vaccination Network has not provided accurate information to parents about the risks and benefits of immunisation. Any link between the measles vaccine and autism has been conclusively discredited by numerous studies and reviews by credible experts, including the World Health Organisation, the American Academy of Paediatrics and the UK Medical Research Council."'' <ref>{{Citation

In December 2011 the Queensland Minister for Health, Geoff Wilson, issued a media statement criticising the AVN with the following comment, “For the small number of people who might be entertained by what Ms Dorey has to say, Woodford Folk Festival has a place for everyone. Just don’t take her nonsense too seriously.” The Hon. Geoff Wilson also added, “The fact is vaccinations have saved millions of lives.
