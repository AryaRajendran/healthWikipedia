A '''musculoskeletal system''' (also known as the '''locomotor system''') is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ system]] that gives [[animal]]s (and humans) the ability to move using the [[Muscular system|muscular]] and [[skeletal system]]s. The musculoskeletal system provides form, support, stability, and movement to the body.
 
It is made up of the body's bones (the [[skeleton]]), [[muscle]]s, [[cartilage]],<ref>{{MeshName|Musculoskeletal+System}}</ref> [[tendons]], [[ligaments]], [[joints]], and other [[connective tissue]] that supports and binds tissues and organs together. The musculoskeletal system's primary functions include supporting the body, allowing motion, and protecting vital organs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/bone_joint_and_muscle_disorders/biology_of_the_musculoskeletal_system/muscles.html |title=Muscles |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Mooar |first=Pekka |year=2007 |work=Merck Manual }}</ref> The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage system for [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] and contains critical components of the [[hematopoietic system]].<ref name=merkvetpage/> 

This system describes how [[bone]]s are connected to other bones and [[muscle]] fibers via [[connective tissue]] such as [[tendon]]s and [[ligament]]s. The bones provide the stability to a body in analogy to iron rods in concrete construction. [[Muscles]] keep bones in place and also play a role in movement of the bones. To allow motion, different bones are connected by [[joint]]s.  [[Cartilage]] prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly on to each other. Muscles contract (bunch up) to move the bone attached at the joint.

There are, however, diseases and disorders that may adversely affect the function and overall effectiveness of the system. These diseases can be difficult to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] due to the close relation of the musculoskeletal system to other internal systems. The musculoskeletal system refers to the system having its muscles attached to an internal [[skeletal system]] and is necessary for [[humans]] to move to a more favorable position. Complex issues and injuries involving the musculoskeletal system are usually handled by a [[physiatrist]] (specialist in [[Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]]) or an [[orthopaedic surgeon]].

== Subsystems ==
=== Skeletal ===
{{main|Human skeleton}}
[[Image:Human skeleton front en.svg|thumb|right|Front view of a skeleton of an adult human]]
The Skeletal System serves many important functions; it provides the shape and form for our bodies in addition to supporting, protecting, allowing bodily movement, producing [[blood]] for the body, and storing minerals.<ref name=skeletalsystem>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/biology/humananatomy/skeletal/skeletalsystem.html |title=The Skeletal System |accessdate=2009-01-03 |last=Applegate |first=Edith |coauthors=Kent Van De Graaff }}</ref> The number of bones in the human skeletal system is a controversial topic. Humans are born with over 300 bones; however, many bones fuse together between birth and maturity. As a result an average adult [[skeleton]] consists of 206 bones. The number of bones varies according to the method used to derive the count. While some consider certain structures to be a single bone with multiple parts, others may see it as a single part with multiple bones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/science-fact-finder/human-body/how-many-bones-human-body |title=The Human Body / How Many Bones Are In The Human Body? |accessdate=2009-01-24 |last=Engelbert |first=Phillis |coauthors=Carol DeKane Nagel |year=2009 |work=U·X·L Science Fact Finder |publisher=eNotes.com, Inc. }}</ref> There are five general classifications of bones. These are [[Long bones]], [[Short bones]], [[Flat bones]], [[Irregular bones]], and [[Sesamoid bones]]. The human skeleton is composed of both fused and individual bones supported by [[ligaments]], [[tendons]], [[muscles]] and [[cartilage]]. It is a complex structure with two distinct divisions. These are the [[axial skeleton]] and the [[appendicular skeleton]].<ref name=becomehealthy/>

====Function====
The Skeletal System serves as a framework for [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organs]] to attach themselves to. This system acts as a protective structure for vital organs. Major examples of this are the [[Human brain|brain]] being protected by the [[Human skull|skull]] and the [[Human lungs|lungs]] being protected by the [[rib cage]]. 

Located in [[long bones]] are two distinctions of [[bone marrow]] (yellow and red). The yellow marrow has [[fatty]] [[connective tissue]] and is found in the marrow [[cavity]]. During starvation, the body uses the [[fat]] in yellow marrow for energy.<ref name=adam>{{cite web|url=http://www.besthealth.com/besthealth/bodyguide/reftext/html/skel_sys_fin.html |title=Skeletal System |accessdate=2009-01-08 |year=2001 }}</ref> The red marrow of some bones is an important site for [[blood cell]] production, approximately 2.6 million [[red blood cells]] per second in order to replace existing cells that have been destroyed by the [[liver]].<ref name=skeletalsystem/> Here all [[erythrocyte]]s, [[platelet]]s, and most [[leukocyte]]s form in adults. From the red marrow, erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes migrate to the blood to do their special tasks. 

Another function of bones is the storage of certain minerals. [[Calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] are among the main minerals being stored. The importance of this storage "device" helps to regulate [[mineral balance]] in the bloodstream. When the fluctuation of [[minerals]] is high, these minerals are stored in [[bone]]; when it is low it will be withdrawn from the bone.

=== Muscular ===
{{main|muscle}}
[[Image:Illu muscle tissues.jpg|thumb|left|Types of muscle and their appearance]]
[[Image:Muscles anterior labeled.png|thumb]] 
[[Image:Muscle posterior labeled.png|thumb]]
There are three types of muscles&mdash;[[Cardiac muscle|cardiac]], [[Skeletal muscle|skeletal]], and [[Smooth muscle|smooth]]. Smooth muscles are used to control the flow of substances within the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumens]] of hollow [[organs]], and are [[involuntary muscle|not consciously controlled]]. Skeletal and cardiac muscles have [[Striated muscle|striations]] that are visible under a [[microscope]] due to the components within their cells. Only skeletal and smooth muscles are part of the musculoskeletal system and only the skeletal muscles can move the body. Cardiac muscles are found in the [[heart]] and are used only to circulate [[blood]]; like the smooth muscles, these muscles are not under conscious control. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and arranged in opposing groups around [[joints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/bone_joint_and_muscle_disorders/biology_of_the_musculoskeletal_system/muscles.html |title=Muscles |accessdate=2008-11-16 |last=Mooar |first=Pekka |year=2007 |work=The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library }}</ref>  Muscles are innervated, to communicate nervous energy to,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/innervated |title=innervated |accessdate=2009-01-03 |year=2008 |work=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC. }}</ref> by [[nerve]]s, which conduct electrical currents from the [[central nervous system]] and cause the muscles to contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/classes/phyb/phyb516/index.htm |title=SMOOTH MUSCLE |accessdate=2008-11-19 |last=Bárány |first=Michael |year=2002 }}</ref>

====Contraction initiation ====
{{main|muscle contraction}}
In [[mammals]], when a muscle contracts, a series of reactions occur. [[Muscle contraction]] is stimulated by the [[motor neuron]] sending a message to the muscles from the [[somatic nervous system]]. [[Depolarization]] of the [[motor neuron]] results in [[neurotransmitter]]s being released from the [[nerve terminal]]. The space between the nerve terminal and the muscle [[cell (biology)|cell]] is called the [[neuromuscular junction]]. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the [[Chemical synapse|synapse]] and bind to specific receptor sites on the [[sarcolemma|cell membrane of the muscle fiber]]. When enough receptors are stimulated, an  [[action potential]] is generated and the [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] of the [[sarcolemma]] is altered. This process is known as [[initiation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meat.tamu.edu/muscontract.html |title=The Mechanism of Muscle Contraction |accessdate=2008-11-18 |work=Principles of Meat Science (4th Edition) }}</ref>

==== Tendons ====
{{main|tendon}}
A tendon is a tough, flexible band of [[fibrous connective tissue]] that connects muscles to bones.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/sportsmedicine/g/tendon.htm |title=Tendons |accessdate=2008-11-19 |last=Jonathan |first=Cluett |year=2008 }}</ref>  The extra-cellular connective tissue between muscle fibers binds to tendons at the distal & proximal ends, and the tendon binds to the [[periosteum]] of individual bones at the muscle's origin & insertion. As muscles contract, tendons transmit the forces to the relatively [[rigid bones]], pulling on them and causing movement.  Tendons can stretch substantially, allowing them to function as springs during locomotion, thereby saving energy.

===Joints, ligaments, and bursae===
==== Joints ====
{{main|joint}}
[[Image:Illu synovial joint.jpg|thumb|right|Human synovial joint composition]]
Joints are structures that connect individual bones and may allow bones to move against each other to cause movement. There are two divisions of joints, [[Synovial joint|diarthroses]] which allow extensive mobility between two or more articular heads, and false joints or [[Synarthrosis|synarthroses]], joints that are immovable, that allow little or no movement and are predominantly [[fibrous]]. [[Synovial joint]]s, joints that are not directly joined, are lubricated by a solution called [[synovial Fluid]] that is produced by the [[synovial membrane]]s. This fluid lowers the [[friction]] between the articular surfaces and is kept within an [[articular capsule]], binding the joint with its taut tissue.<ref name=becomehealthy/>

==== Ligaments ====
{{main|ligament}}
A [[ligament]] is a small band of dense, white, [[fibrous]] [[elastic tissue]].<ref name=becomehealthy>{{cite web|url=http://www.becomehealthynow.com/category/bodymusculo/ |title=The Musculoskeletal System |accessdate=2008-11-18 |last=Gary |first=Farr |date=2002-06-25 }}</ref>  Ligaments connect the ends of bones together in order to form a joint. Most ligaments limit [[dislocation]], or prevent certain movements that may cause breaks. Since they are only [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] they increasingly lengthen when under pressure. When this occurs the ligament may be susceptible to break resulting in an unstable joint.

Ligaments may also restrict some actions: movements such as [[Extension (kinesiology)|hyper extension]] and [[Flexion|hyper flexion]] are restricted by ligaments to an extent. Also ligaments prevent certain directional movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article1268.html |title=Ligaments |accessdate=2009-03-16 |last=Bridwell |first=Keith |date=06/07/2008 }}</ref>

==== Bursa ====
{{main|bursa (anatomy)}}
A bursa is a small fluid-filled sac made of white [[fibrous tissue]] and lined with [[synovial membrane]]. Bursa may also be formed by a synovial membrane that extends outside of the [[joint capsule]].<ref name=adam/> It provides a cushion between bones and tendons and/or muscles around a joint; bursa are filled with [[synovial fluid]] and are found around almost every major joint of the body.

Because many other body systems, including the [[Circulatory system|vascular]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and [[integumentary system]]s, are interrelated, disorders of one of these systems may also affect the musculoskeletal system and complicate the diagnosis of the disorder's origin. Diseases of the musculoskeletal system mostly encompass functional disorders or motion discrepancies; the level of impairment depends specifically on the problem and its severity. Articular (of or pertaining to the joints)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/articular |title=articular |accessdate=2008-11-15 |year=2006 |work=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Random House, Inc. }}</ref> disorders are the most common. However, also among the diagnoses are: primary muscular diseases, neurologic (related to the medical science that deals with the nervous system and disorders affecting it)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neurologic |title=neurologic |accessdate=2008-11-15 |year=2006 |work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref> deficits, toxins, [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] abnormalities, [[Metabolism|metabolic]] disorders, infectious diseases, blood and vascular disorders, and nutritional imbalances. Disorders of muscles from another body system can bring about irregularities such as: impairment of ocular motion and control, respiratory dysfunction, and bladder malfunction. Complete [[paralysis]], [[paresis]], or [[ataxia]] may be caused by primary muscular dysfunctions of [[infectious]] or [[toxic]] origin; however, the primary disorder is usually related to the [[nervous system]], with the muscular system acting as the effector organ, an organ capable of responding to a stimulus, especially a nerve impulse.<ref name=merkvetpage>{{cite book | last = Kahn | first = Cynthia | authorlink = | coauthors = Scott Line | title = Musculoskeletal System Introduction: Introduction | publisher = Merck & Co., Inc. | year = 2008 | location = NJ, USA | pages = | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/90100.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>   One understated disorder that begins during [[pregnancy]] is [[PGP|Pelvic girdle pain]], it is complex and multi-factorial and likely to be also represented by a series of sub-groups driven by pain varying from peripheral or central nervous system,<ref name= Diagnosis>[[Diagnosis]] and classification of [[human pelvic girdle|pelvic girdle]] [[pain]] disorders— Part 1: A mechanism based approach within a bio psychosocial framework.
