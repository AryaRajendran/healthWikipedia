'''St John Ambulance Singapore''' is a voluntary organisation in [[Singapore]] which provides training in First Aid and Home Nursing. Its members also perform voluntary first aid coverage duties during national events.

The [[headquarters]] is located at 420 [[Beach Road, Singapore|Beach Road]]. It was opened on July 23, 1960 by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (and subsequently [[President of Singapore]]), En. [[Yusof bin Ishak]].

==Structure==
The St John Ambulance Singapore comes under the command of the National St John Council with the following appointments:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Appointment

| Council Chairman
| Dr Teh Peng Hooi C.St.J.

|-
| Vice-Chairman
| Dr Selan Sayapanathan SB.St.J. 
|-
| Vice-Chairman
| Mr Yeo Fook Hong SB.St.J. 
|}
Apart from promoting and assisting St. John Ambulance Association & Brigade as well as to raise the necessary funds to support their work, the main objects of the Council, are briefly as follows:

#To promote and encourage all works of humanity and charity for the relief of distress, suffering, sickness and danger without any distinction as to race, class or creed, and the extension of the great principles of the Order of St John embodied in its mottoes "for the Faith" and "For the Service of Mankind".
#To render aid to the sick, wounded, disabled or suffering and to promote such permanent organisation in time of peace, as may be available immediately in time of emergency, such aid shall include the provision of technical reserves for the Medical services of the Armed Forces or civil defence organisations in the Republic of Singapore.
#To do such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects or any of them.

In June 1978, the Brigade was reorganised and upgraded to National Headquarters level with the following appointments:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Appointment
! Incumbent
|-
| Chief Commissioner
| Prof Goh Hood Keng, Christopher 
|-
| Deputy Chief Commissioner
| Mr Tan Yak Huang
|-
| Chief Surgeon
| Dr Nelson Chua
|-
| Senior Assistant Chief Commissioner (Administration)
| Mr Seah Boon Chun
|-
| Senior Assistant Chief Commissioner (Operations)
| Mr Tian Mong Ching
|-
| Senior Assistant Chief Commissioner (Nursing)
| Ms Wong Ngiuk Moy, Linda
|}
 
This brought our organisation status at par with St. John Ambulance organisations in other independent nations. The Brigade was structured into 4 Districts and 10 Areas.

In 1996, the Brigade was again re-structured. The District level was removed, and the Brigade became simply structured into 10 Zones.

==Cadet movement==
[[File:StJohnAmbulanceBrigade-RemembranceDayParade-20031111.jpg|thumb|SJAB Singapore cadets on parade]]

St John Ambulance in Singapore largely consists of cadet members - i.e. secondary school students who joined St John as their [[Co-curricular activity|CCA]]. Currently, the various schools under the 10 Zones are as follows:

As St John the Baptist Day, June 24 normally falls during the Singapore School Holidays, St John Cadets observe St John Ambulance Brigade Day on the first Wednesday after school reopens. On that day, all St John Ambulance Brigade members in schools will report to school in Brigade Uniform, and the St John Day Message by the Chief Commissioner will be read out by the Principal or a student leader. On that day, St John members reaffirm their loyalty to the Republic of Singapore and affirm their commitment to the mottoes of the Order, 'For the Faith' and 'For the Service of Mankind'.

Typically, St John cadets in Singapore learn First Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation of Casualties and footdrill as part of their core syllabus. They also have the opportunity to go on other enrichment activities such as camping trips where they can earn proficiency badges [http://www.sjab.org.sg/cpbsys.html]. Outstanding members may also vie for the prestigious Chief Commissioner's Badge, which is only attainable after obtaining 12 proficiency badges according to a set of strict criteria.

===Pledge===

To be loyal to the Chief Commissioner and all my Officers

To read the Brigade Regulations and to comply with them in all respects

To carry out all orders received from time to time from seniors

To carry out my duties with zeal and efficiency to the best of my ability

To be courteous and honest in all my words and actions

===Cadet Proficiency Badge Scheme===
