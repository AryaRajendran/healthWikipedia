[[Tourette syndrome]] (also Tourette's syndrome or TS) is an [[heredity|inherited]] [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of motor and phonic [[tic]]s.  '''Treatment of Tourette syndrome''' has the goal of managing symptoms to achieve optimum functioning, rather than eliminating symptoms; not all persons with Tourette's require treatment, and there is no cure or universally effective medication.<ref name=dude>Schapiro NA.

Tourette syndrome patients may exhibit symptoms of other [[comorbid]] conditions along with their motor and phonic tics.  Associated conditions include [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADD or ADHD), [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[learning disabilities]] and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=NIH/>  Patients who have ADHD along with Tourette's may also have problems with disruptive behaviors, overall functioning, and [[cognitive]] function.  Co-occurring [[OCD]] can also be a source of impairment, necessitating treatment.  Not all persons with tics will also have other conditions and not all persons with tics require treatment, but when comorbid disorders are present, they often require treatment. Some tics include stretching of the mouth, clearing of the throat, or grunting.

[[Stimulants]] (like [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]]) are underused in the treatment of ADHD when tics are also present because of fears that they increase tics.<ref name=Swerdlow2005/><ref name=Assessment/>  Experimental treatments like [[deep brain stimulation]], [[nicotine]], [[marijuana]] and [[complementary and alternative medicine]] approaches have widespread appeal but unproven safety and efficacy.

==Treatment priority==
Treatment of Tourette syndrome can be divided into treatment of tics, and treatment of [[Comorbidity|co-occurring]] conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of functional impairment than the tics themselves.<ref name=Assessment>Scahill L, Erenberg G, Berlin CM Jr, Budman C, Coffey BJ, Jankovic J, Kiessling L, King RA, Kurlan R, Lang A, Mink J, Murphy T, Zinner S, Walkup J; Tourette Syndrome Association Medical Advisory Board: Practice Committee.

While pharmacological treatment is reserved for more severe symptoms, other types of treatments may help avoid or improve symptoms of [[clinical depression|depression]] or [[social isolation]], and improve supportive family functioning.  Educating the patient, family, and surrounding community (school, church, friends, etc.) is a key part of treatment.<ref name=dude/>

The majority of people with TS require no medication, but medication is available to help when symptoms interfere with functioning.<ref name=NIH/>  Because children with tics often present to physicians when their tics are at their highest severity, and because of the waxing and waning nature of tics, medication is not usually started immediately or changed often.  Frequently, the tics subside with understanding of the condition and a supportive environment.<ref name=dude/>  When medication is necessary, pharmaceutical intervention should be targeted at the most impairing symptoms, taking into account [[comorbid|co-occurring]] conditions such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] or [[OCD]], which when present, may warrant treatment even when tics are mild.<ref name=Zinner/>

The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—[[Typical antipsychotics|typical]] and [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical]] [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptics]] including [[risperidone]] (trade name<ref>Medication trade names may differ between countries. In general, this article uses North American trade names.</ref> Risperdal), [[ziprasidone]] (Geodon), [[haloperidol]] (Haldol), [[pimozide]] (Orap) and [[fluphenazine]] (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].<ref name=Assessment>Scahill L, Erenberg G, Berlin CM Jr, Budman C, Coffey BJ, Jankovic J, Kiessling L, King RA, Kurlan R, Lang A, Mink J, Murphy T, Zinner S, Walkup J; Tourette Syndrome Association Medical Advisory Board: Practice Committee.

"Dude, you don't have Tourette's:" Tourette's syndrome, beyond the tics. ''Pediatr Nurs.'' 2002 May-Jun;28(3):243–6, 249-53. PMID 12087644</ref>  [[Stimulants]] and other medications may be useful in treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including [[guanfacine]] (Tenex), [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera) and [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclics]].  [[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil), a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]—a class of [[antidepressant]]s including [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), and [[fluvoxamine]] (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.<ref name=Assessment/>

==Treatment of tics==
[[Image:Haloperidol-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Space-filling model|Space-filling representation]] of a [[haloperidol]] molecule. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication sometimes used to treat severe cases of Tourette's.]]There are no medications specifically designed to target tics, although some [[antipsychotic]]s (for example, [[pimozide]]) have been [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved for treating Tourette's.  Medications which are used as primary treatment in other conditions are used with some success in treating tics.  Neuroleptic medications ([[antipsychotics]]), such as [[haloperidol]] (brand name [[Haloperidol|Haldol]]) or [[pimozide]] (brand name [[Pimozide|Orap]]), have historically been and continue to be the medications with the most proven efficacy in controlling tics.  These medications work by blocking [[dopamine receptor]]s, and are associated with a high side effect profile.  The traditional antipsychotic drugs are associated with [[tardive dyskinesia]] when used long-term; and [[parkinsonism]], [[dystonia]], [[dyskinesia]], and [[akathisia]] when used short-term.  Additional side effects can be [[school phobia]] (a form of [[separation anxiety]]), [[clinical depression|depression]], weight gain, and [[cognitive blunting]] (dulling of [[cognition|cognitive]] ability).  Another traditional antipsychotic used in treating Tourette's is [[fluphenazine]] (brand name Prolixin), although the evidence supporting its use is less than that of [[haloperidol]] and [[pimozide]].<ref name=Assessment/>

Newer neuroleptics, the atypical neuroleptics, are an alternative to the traditional medications used for treating tics.  These medications have more selective dopamine blocking effects, or block [[serotonin]] with some blocking of dopamine.  The medications in this class used to treat tics include [[risperidone]] (brand name Risperdal), [[olanzapine]] (brand name Zyprexa), [[ziprasidone]] (brand name Geodon), [[quetiapine]] (brand name Seroquel),  [[clozapine]] (brand name Clozaril), tiapride, and [[sulpiride]].  They seem to have lower risks of [[neurological]] side effects (such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]) when used short-term, but longer trials are needed to confirm this.  Some of the side effects associated with these medications are [[insomnia]], weight gain, and school phobia.  Abnormalities in metabolism, [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|cardiac conduction]] times, and increased risk of diabetes are concerns with these medications.  There is good empirical support for the use of [[risperidone]], and less support for the others.<ref name=Assessment/>

[[Image:Clonidine pills and patch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Clonidine]] (or the clonidine patch) is one of the medications typically tried first when medication is needed for Tourette's.]]
The [[Adrenergic receptor#Type .CE.B12|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] agonists ([[antihypertensive]] agents) show some efficacy in reducing tics, as well as other [[comorbid]] features of some people with Tourette's.  Originally developed to treat high blood pressure, these medications are a safer alternative to neuroleptic medications for the people with TS that respond to them.  This class of medication is often the first tried for tics, as the [[antihypertensives]] have a lower side effect profile than some of the medications which more proven efficacy.  The evidence for their safety and efficacy is not as strong as the evidence for some of the standard and atypical neuroleptics, but there is fair supportive evidence for their use, nonetheless.<ref>[[James F. Leckman|Leckman JF]], Hardin MT, Riddle MA, ''et al.''  Clonidine treatment of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.  ''Arch Gen Psychiatry''. 1991 Apr;48(4):324–8. PMID 2009034 </ref>  This class of medication takes about six weeks to begin to work on tics, so sustained trials are warranted.  Because of the blood pressure effects, antihypertensive agents should not be discontinued suddenly.  [[Clonidine]] (brand name [[Catapres]]) works on tics for about half of people with TS.<ref>[[James F. Leckman|Leckman JF]], [[Donald J. Cohen|Cohen DJ]], Detlor J, ''et al.''

Side effects can include sedation, dry mouth, fatigue, headaches and dizziness.  [[Sedation]] can be problematic when treatment is first initiated, but may wear off as the patient adjusts to the medication.<ref name=Assessment/>

Other medications that can be used to treat tics include [[pergolide]] (brand name Permax), [[botulinum toxin]], and with less empirical support for efficacy, [[tetrabenazine]] and [[baclofen]].<ref name=Assessment/>

Caffeine may trigger an exacerbation of tics in some children, so they are advised to limit its consumption.<ref name=Swain/>

==Treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders==
[[Image:Adderallrx.jpg|thumb|[[Stimulants]] (such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]]) are underused in the treatment of ADHD when tics are also present.]]
Patients with Tourette's who are referred to specialty clinics have a high rate of [[comorbid]] [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), so the treatment of ADHD co-occurring with tics is often part of the clinical treatment of Tourette's. Patients who have ADHD along with Tourette's may also have problems with disruptive behaviors, overall functioning, and [[cognitive]] function, accounted for by the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating other conditions when present.<ref>Sukhodolsky DG, Scahill L, Zhang H, ''et al.''

==Behavioral treatments==
[[Habit reversal training]] (HRT), [[massed negative practice]], [[biofeedback]], relaxation, [[hypnosis]] and other behavioral approaches are proposed as alternative treatments of tics, but few have been well assessed.<ref name=SingerBehavior/> [[Relaxation technique]]s, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may be useful in relieving stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and [[biofeedback]], with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not proven therapies for Tourette's.<ref name=Woods>Woods DW, Himle MB, Conelea CA.
