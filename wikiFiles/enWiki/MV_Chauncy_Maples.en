'''MV ''Chauncy Maples''''' is a [[motor ship]] and former [[Steamboat|steamship]] that was launched in 1901 as '''SS ''Chauncy Maples'''''. She has spent her entire career on [[Lake Malawi]] (formerly more widely known by its Tanzanian name of Lake Nyasa) and is regarded as the oldest ship afloat in [[Africa]].<ref>[http://www.chauncymaples.org/default.php Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust: Video |accessdate=20 May 2012]</ref> After more than one hundred years' service she will be restored for use as a floating [[medical clinic]] to support the several million lakeshore dwellers whose average life expectancy is 44 years. The [[Politics of Malawi|Government of Malawi]] offered support for this in 2009 but it will depend on the results of charity fundraising.

==Shipbuilders Alley & McLellan, Polmadie==
The location of the [[Sentinel Waggon Works#Alley & MacLellan, Sentinel Works, Jessie Street Glasgow|Alley & McLellan]] [[shipyard]] in [[Polmadie]], [[Lanarkshire]], might appear perverse, as the yard was a considerable distance from the [[River Clyde]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Millar |first=W.J. |title=The Clyde, From Its Source to The Sea |year=1888 |publisher=[[Blackie and Son Limited|Blackie & Son]] |location=Glasgow & London |page= |pages= |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/clydefromitssour00milluoft/clydefromitssour00milluoft_djvu.txt |accessdate=}}</ref> with the expansive final approach into [[Glasgow Central Station]] posing just one of many barriers between it and the Clyde. However, the company specialised in supporting the far reaches of the [[British Empire]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=P.J. |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire |year=1996 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-43211-1 |pages=not cited}}</ref> by building vessels that were dismantled into kit form once they had been completed.

The resulting set of parts was frequently enormous and a daunting logistical task to transport. Re-assembly also depended heavily upon the availability of skilled labour at the customer’s premises. However, as in the case of the ''Chauncy Maples'', this was frequently the only viable option when the ultimate destination was very far inland, away from any semblance of modern communications.

==Purpose and delivery==
The SS ''Chauncy Maples'' was destined to steam the extensive waters of Lake Nyasa, the most southerly lake in East Africa. At {{convert|350|mi|km}} long and {{convert|50|mi|km}} wide it is the eighth largest inland water in the World. It is also the second deepest lake in Africa and home to more fish species than any other lake on Earth, giving an easy source of food for those who live around its shores.

Conceived and commissioned by the [[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] (UMCA),<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] |title=Specification for Screw Steamer for Lake Nyasa |year=1898 |publisher=Waterlow & Sons |location=London |pages=not stated}}</ref> the 150 ton ship was one of the last designs produced by [[Henry Marc Brunel]], son of the Victorian engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].<ref name=CMTrust/> Once dismantled, the complex kit of almost 3,481 parts was transported by cargo ship to Portuguese East Africa, then towed by barge up the dangerous waters of the [[Zambezi]].<ref name=CMTrust/>

The boiler was built by Abbott of [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]].<ref name=CMTrust/> It weighed 11 tons and was transported in one piece on a special wagon fitted with [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] wheels, to be hauled overland by 450 [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] tribesmen for {{convert|350|mi|km}} through uncharted malarial land to the [[East African Rift]].<ref name=CMTrust/> The other parts of the ship were man-handled or carried on the heads of men and women over difficult terrain and across river beds: they averaged only {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} a day.<ref name=CMTrust/>

==David Livingstone==
[[File:Maples and Johnson.jpg|thumb|240px|Archdeacon Chauncy Maples (left) with fellow missionary Rev. W.P. Johnson in 1895]]
[[David Livingstone]], the first European to reach the lake and an evangelist for steamboat missions,<ref>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=David |title=Steam and Quinine on Africa's Great Lakes |year=1997 |publisher=Bygone Ships, Trains & Planes |location=[[Pretoria]] |isbn=0-620-21332-9 |pages=not stated}}</ref> had made much quicker progress in 1859, claiming much of the area surrounding the lake as part of the British Empire, forming the colony of Nyasaland. Although Portugal took control of the eastern shores of the lake, the islands of [[Likoma Island|Likoma]] and [[Chizumulu]] were colonised by Scottish missionaries and, as a result, became part of Nyasaland rather than [[Portuguese East Africa]] (now [[Mozambique]]).

==Reassembly==
Re-assembly<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson-Morshead |first=A.E.M. |title=The Building of the Chauncy Maples |year=1903 |publisher=[[Universities’ Mission to Central Africa]] |location=Westminster |pages=not cited}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson-Morshead |first1=A.E.M. |last2=Garland |first2=Vera |title=Lady of the Lake: the story of Lake Malawi's M.V. Chauncy Maples: being a facsimile reprint of "The Building of the Chauncy Maples" |year=1991 |publisher=Central Africana |location=[[Blantyre, Malawi]] |pages=not cited}}</ref> of the Chauncy Maples proved to be even more arduous than the journey—in error, the part numbers had been stamped on each section prior to the galvanising process, making the task for the African engineers even more complex. It took two years to re-assemble; the vessel was finally launched on 6 June 1901 and named after [[Chauncy Maples|Bishop Chauncy Maples]],<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Dictionary of African Christian Biography |year= |publisher= |location= |section= Maples, Chauncy |page= |url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/malawi/maples_chauncy.html |accessdate=}}</ref> an [[Anglican]] missionary, later Bishop of Nyasaland. Tragically while on the way to take up his duties, his boat capsized during a storm on Lake Nyasa and he drowned because of the weight of his cassock.<ref>{{cite book |last=Frere |first=Gertrude |title=Where Black Meets White: the little history of the UMCA |year=1901 |publisher=[[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] |location=Westminster |page= |pages= |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/whereblackmeets00frergoog/whereblackmeets00frergoog_djvu.txt |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Hospital ship, missionary school and the extinction of the slave trade==
Missionaries brought to Africa far more than religion and the UMCA had a very clear vision for their £9,000 investment. The ship had three overt tasks – to give the lake a hospital ship, a missionary school and an emergency refuge from Arab slave traders. In reality, the goals were of more global importance; as one of the Mission’s founding supporters, the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]],<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Oxford and Cambridge Mission to Central Africa, Meeting at Cambridge, Tuesday, November 1, 1859 |year=1859 |publisher=[[Odhams Press]] |location=London |pages=not cited}}</ref> had  made clear, the prime task was ''"the work of civilising commerce, the extinction of the slave-trade and, if possible, the colonisation of Africa"''.

Lake Nyasa was remote even by African standards, and initial progress with medical provision at Likoma was erratic. The programme had been introduced in 1894, during the brief stay of a UMCA physician. His replacement was the Rev [[John Edward Hine]], who although also a medical doctor was ultimately little interested in this aspect of his duties. When Hine was appointed Bishop of [[Diocese of Eastern Equatorial Africa|Eastern Equatorial Africa]] in 1896 he chose to concentrate on spiritual rather than health-related matters.

[[File:Chauncy Maples 1905.jpg|thumb|300px|SS ''Chauncy Maples'' at anchor on Lake Nyasa four years after her launch]]
It was the coincident arrival of both the ''Chauncy Maples'' and Dr. Robert Howard that produced a radical change in the level and quality of medical provision to the lakeside inhabitants. Howard quickly laid the foundation of a robust health system with the ''Chauncy Maples'' fulfilling a central role. By the 1930s many stations, including those on the periphery, had health clinics run by missionary nurses or by African assistants. With the advantage of details on local diseases gathered by other doctors in the area, mainly from the Scottish missions, Dr. Howard adopted an anti-malaria strategy, and in conjunction with colleagues at [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]] mission, embarked on an anti-smallpox vaccination program.

For a poorly-resourced mission, the cost of maintaining the steamer required a strong focus on local provisioning. With a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] permitting access to all areas of the lake, the ship itself was largely self-sustaining, her steam engine powered by wood scavenged from the shore areas. But the matter of slave raiding was more problematic, requiring not only manpower for site security, but also an appreciation of the uneasy boundaries that lay between the worlds of evangelism, medicine and trade. Finding appropriately qualified crew prepared to accept low pay and the tribulations of life on the lake was one thing; the Mission’s unyielding insistence on celibacy among its European staff was an even greater recruitment challenge. Behind all this lay the tensions arising from the Mission’s intentional policy of overextension of its mission surrounding Lake Nyasa. The ''Chauncy Maples'' operated in the contradictory world of an evangelical mission which offered desperately needed medical support to the poor in an environment of political instability and unfettered imperial capitalism.

The ship has served much longer than her name-sake. Apart from a period of service during the [[World War I|First World War]] as a troop carrier and [[gunboat]], she served the inhabitants of Nyasaland for half a century until 1953, when she was sold and converted into a [[Fishing trawler|trawler]].<ref name=CMTrust/> In 1967 the Malawian government bought her, refitted her as a passenger and cargo ship and replaced her steam engine with a [[Crossley]] in-line diesel engine.<ref name=CMTrust/> Her steam engine is preserved in the Lake Malawi Museum at [[Mangochi]].<ref name=CMTrust/> The ship is currently laid up at Monkey Bay.<ref name=CMTrust/>

==Controversies of European Christian missions==
Although work in the field of health was conducted out of the conviction that western medicine was good for Africans, it was not an entirely altruistic programme. The missionaries were to reflect the emerging [[Victorian era|Victorian]] view of Africa and African peoples, that African thought and behaviour needed radical change if they were to be converted to western values. Like missionary work in other parts of Africa, it was viewed as a key means to prove the power and mystery of the Christian message.<ref name=Good>{{cite book |last=Good |first=Charles M, Jr |title=The Steamer Parish — The Rise and Fall of Missionary Medicine on an African Frontier |year=2004 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |pages=not cited |url=http://kar.kent.ac.uk/7718/1/Macola-SteamerParish-91129-1.pdf |accessdate=}}</ref>

In retrospect there is evidence of a lack of missionary sensitivity to many aspects of African culture, the injustices of early colonial land policies, the low priority given to theological education, and the slowness to ordain African clergy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sindama |first=Harvey J |title=The Legacy of Scottish Missionaries in Malawi |year=1992 |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |location=Lampeter |pages=not cited}}</ref> But much as missionaries must be viewed as principally propagators of basic religion, their work in introducing ideas of western medicine and technology undoubtedly had a profound impact on the foundations of modern public health in the region. By 1965, churches provided around 45 per cent of all hospital beds in Malawi.<ref name=Good/>

Some of the missionaries who spent time on the ship recognised the ironic nature of elements of their work. The Rev. George Wilson  recorded in his diary:
<blockquote>''"Wherever a European goes he seems to carry some subtle power of change; whether it be the government official, the missionary, the planter or the trader, each is working for change, whether he knows it or not. This is a matter of great anxiety to all who love Africans, for I cannot feel at all certain that this change must necessarily be for the better."''<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=George Herbert |title=A Missionary’s Life in Nyasaland |year=1925 |publisher=[[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] |location=London |pages=not cited |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/missionaryslifei00wilsiala/missionaryslifei00wilsiala_djvu.txt |accessdate=}}</ref></blockquote>

However, most commentators would have accepted that radical change was now an urgent requirement, as was made clear by the Rev. [[Robert Keable]] a missionary in [[Zanzibar]]:
<blockquote>''"We walked into the partially walled compound or court representing the slave-market a ''bona fide'' affair, not like the [[caravanserai]] which used to be fitted up and furnished by the [[Cairo|Cairene]] [[Dragoman]] for the inspection of curious tourists. A wooden cage, about twenty feet square, often contained some one hundred and fifty men, women, and children, who every day were 'knocked down' to the highest bidder in the public place."''<ref>{{cite book |last=Robert |first=Keable |authorlink=Robert Keable |title=Darkness or Light: Illustrating the Theory and Practice of Missions |year=1914 |publisher=[[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] |location=London |pages=not cited}}</ref></blockquote>

The personal cost was high. In the gardens of St. Michael's church at [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]], the city named after Livingstone's birthplace in Scotland, is a memorial plaque to fourteen members of the Nyasaland Mission who died in the service of the [[Church of Scotland]]'s African missions. The dates of death given on the plaque range from 1890 to 1919. A passage from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] reads: ''"He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it"''.<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]], Chapter 10, verse 39, [[King James Version]]</ref>

==Restoration==
[[File:Chauncy Maples1.jpg|thumb|240px|MV ''Chauncy Maples'' awaiting restoration in 2008. The current [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] is not original to the ship and will be removed to improve her stability and to return her to her original configuration.]]

The last formal inspection in 1992 revealed little damage to the riveted steel hull; although a single skin hull no longer complies with modern regulations, she has been granted an exemption on the grounds of historical importance. The higher quality of steel produced in 1899 no doubt also played a part—-after placing the vessel in a dry dock at [[Monkey Bay]] in May 2009, inspecting marine engineer Pieter Volschenk concluded that more-recently constructed ships looked in worse condition after only twenty years at sea. In January 2012 she was brought ashore for the continuing restoration work.<ref name=CMTrust/>

Landlocked Malawi is one of the World's most densely populated and least developed countries. Under a programme led by the Government of Malawi and supported by the independent Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust in Britain,<ref>[http://www.chauncymaples.org/ Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust]</ref> the restored Scottish vessel will return to the task for which she was conceived when enough funds have been raised. An onboard medical team will provide support and treatment to one of the world's poorest nations; with an average life expectancy of only 44 years, millions of lake dwellers currently have no access to health services and face high rates of malaria, HIV-AIDS and tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mi.html |title=Malawi |author= |date= |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |accessdate=}}</ref> The ''Chauncy Maples'' has therefore outlived almost three lifetimes of the people she will continue to serve.

At present the only option for lake dwellers is to travel by [[Dugout (boat)|dug-out canoe]], risking the dangerous lake currents, storms and crocodiles. Recommissioning the ''Chauncy Maples'' would offer the prospect of free treatment for common diseases, as well as other clinical services. The Government of Malawi has already made a major financial contribution to the project. <ref>[http://www.chauncymaples.org/project/default.php Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust: The Project |accessdate=20 May 2012]</ref>
