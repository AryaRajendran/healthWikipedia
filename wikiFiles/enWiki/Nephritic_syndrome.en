{{Distinguish|nephrotic syndrome}}

'''Nephritis syndrome''' (or '''acute nephritic syndrome''')<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/20711646|acute nephritic syndrome}}</ref> is a collection of signs (known as a [[syndrome]]) associated with disorders affecting the [[kidney]]s, more specifically [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerular]] disorders.<ref>http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec17/ch235/ch235b.html</ref> It is characterized by having small pores in the [[podocyte]]s of the [[glomerulus]], large enough to permit proteins ([[proteinuria]]) and [[red blood cell]]s ([[hematuria]]) to pass into the urine. By contrast, [[nephrotic syndrome]] is characterized by only proteins ([[proteinuria]]) moving into the urine. Both nephritic syndrome and [[nephrotic syndrome]] result in [[hypoalbuminemia]] due to protein [[albumin]] moving from the blood to the urine.

Hematuria can be caused by bleeding anywhere in the [[urinary tract]], but if the RBCs are trapped in [[Urinary_casts#Red_blood_cell_casts|urinary cast]]s, it is more likely that the bleeding originated in the [[nephron]], and nephritic syndrome becomes more probable.

It is usually distinguished from nephrotic syndrome, but sometimes the two are described as associated in a minority of cases (occasionally — and confusingly— referred to as "nephritic/nephrotic," although this is considered a progression of a nephritic syndrome and categorically not a nephrotic syndrome).<ref name="urlAcute Nephritic Syndrome">{{cite web |url=http://www.pathology.vcu.edu/education/dental2/renal.html |title=Acute Nephritic Syndrome |work= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> Some conditions can cause either [[syndrome]], and both syndromes can have a similar appearance upon biopsy. Neither term represents a definitive diagnosis, but both terms can be useful in the early stages of a [[differential diagnosis]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Nephritic syndrome is characterized by;
*[[hematuria]] (blood in the urine), with [[urinary casts#Red blood cell casts|red blood cell (RBC) casts]] present in the urine
*[[proteinuria]] (protein in the urine) - small amounts of protein are lost in the urine, but this is usually trivial (<3.5 g/day)
*[[hypertension]]<ref name="urlELECTRONIC LEARNING MODULE for KIDNEY and URINARY TRACT DISEASES">{{cite web |url=http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap8.html |title=ELECTRONIC LEARNING MODULE for KIDNEY and URINARY TRACT DISEASES |work= |accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref> (high blood pressure)- mild
*[[uremia]] - due to retention of waste products
and variable [[renal failure|renal insufficiency]], with;
*[[azotemia]] (elevated blood nitrogen)
*[[oliguria]] (low urine output <400 mL/day)
  
The main features are hypertension and RBC casts.  The proteinuria in nephritic syndrome is not usually severe, but may occasionally be heavy enough to be in the range usually found in [[nephrotic syndrome]].

==Diagnosis==
Nephritic syndrome is not a specific diagnosis.  It is a clinical syndrome and characterized by the above signs.

An anti-streptolysin O titre (or [[Antistreptolysin O titre|ASOT]]) is typically done to test for exposure to [[streptococci]]. This test however has very poor specificity.

==Differential diagnosis==
The two classic diagnoses of nephritic syndrome are:
*[[post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis]]
*[[crescentic glomerulonephritis]] (also called rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis)

Nephritic syndrome causes are usually grouped into 'focal proliferative' and 'diffuse proliferative' on the basis of [[histology]] (obtained by a [[renal biopsy]]).

===Focal proliferative===
*[[IgA nephropathy]]
*[[chronic liver failure]]
*[[Celiac sprue]]
*[[dermatitis herpetiformis]]
*[[Henoch-Schoenlein purpura]]
*[[Alport syndrome]]
*[[lupus erythematosus|SLE]]

===Diffuse proliferative===
*[[membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]] ([[malaria]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[chronic infection]], [[sickle-cell disease]], [[lupus erythematosus|SLE]], [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]]/[[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]])
*[[cryoglobulinemia]]
*[[lupus erythematosus|SLE]]
*[[rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis]] (RPGNs) - several.

==Treatment==
Treatment is dependent on the underlying [[etiology]] (cause) and the degree of kidney dysfunction.

==Prognosis==
Because nephritic syndrome is not a disease, just a collection of symptoms, the prognosis depends on the underlying etiology.
