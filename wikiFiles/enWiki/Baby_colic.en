'''Baby colic''' (also known as '''infantile colic''') is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or displays symptoms of distress (cramping, moaning, etc.) frequently and for extended periods, without any discernible reason. The condition typically appears within the first month of life and often disappears rather suddenly, before the baby is three to four months old, but can last up to one year.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12444822 |year=2002 |last1=Barr |first1=RG |title=Changing our understanding of infant colic |volume=156 |issue=12 |pages=1172–4 |journal=Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine}}</ref> The causes of colic are not settled science.

The crying often increases during a specific period of the day, particularly the early evening. Symptoms may worsen soon after feeding, especially in babies that do not belch easily.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The strict medical definition of colic is ''a condition of a healthy baby in which it shows periods of intense, unexplained fussing/crying lasting more than 3 hours a day, more than 3 days a week for more than 3 weeks.''<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13214956 |year=1954 |last1=Wessel |first1=MA |last2=Cobb |first2=JC |last3=Jackson |first3=EB |last4=Harris Jr |first4=GS |last5=Detwiler |first5=AC |title=Paroxysmal fussing in infancy, sometimes called colic |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=421–35 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref> However, many{{who?|date=December 2012}} doctors consider that definition, first described by Morris Wessel, to be overly narrow and would consider babies with sudden, severe, unexplained crying lasting less than 3 hours/day as having "colic" (so-called "non-Wessel's" colic).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1614771 |year=1992 |last1=Barr |first1=RG |last2=Rotman |first2=A |last3=Yaremko |first3=J |last4=Leduc |first4=D |last5=Francoeur |first5=TE |title=The crying of infants with colic: A controlled empirical description |volume=90 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=14–21 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref> In reality, this extreme version of colic is more likely to be the final stage of a condition that has worsened for a few weeks.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Causes==
For many years, the number one belief of worried parents, grandparents and doctors has been that colicky crying was a sign of abdominal pain (e.g. intestinal spasm, overfeeding, trapped gas).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001610-200303000-00004 |title=What is Known About Infant Colic? |year=2003 |last1=Cirgin Ellett |first1=Marsha L. |journal=Gastroenterology Nursing |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=60–5 |pmid=12682526}}</ref> In fact, even the word "colic" is derived from the ancient Greek word for intestine (sharing the same root as the word "colon"). Today, it is fairly well established that there are a variety of causes of colic symptoms, the most common of which include: stomach gas (possibly due to poor burping or milk flow issues), intestinal gas (pocketed in the intestinal tract), neurological overload (the overwhelmed and overstimulated baby that becomes exhausted) and even a muscular type of colic (perhaps due to muscle spasm and birth trauma). A gastrointestinal (GI) theory of colic seems logical because fussy babies often: grunt/pass gas/double-up/cry after eating; have [[borborygmi]]; improve with stomach pressure, warmth or massage; may improve with pain medication (e.g. paregoric)<ref>{{cite news |first1=Darshak |last1=Sanghavi |title=Bleary parents crave colic cure |work=Boston Globe |date=Mar 29, 2005 |url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/children/articles/2005/03/29/bleary_parents_crave_colic_cure/}}</ref> or sips of herbal teas used for stomach upset (e.g. mint, fennel).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(05)83557-7 |title=Efficacy of herbal tea preparation in infantile colic |year=1993 |last1=Weizman |first1=Zvi |last2=Alkrinawi |first2=Soliman |last3=Goldfarb |first3=Dan |last4=Bitran |first4=Chaim |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=650–2 |pmid=8463920}}</ref>  However, 85–90% of colicky babies have no evidence of serious GI abnormality.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.316.7144.1563 |title=Effectiveness of treatments for infantile colic: Systematic review |year=1998 |last1=Lucassen |first1=P L B J |last2=Assendelft |first2=W J J |last3=Gubbels |first3=J W |last4=Van Eijk |first4=J T M |last5=Van Geldrop |first5=W J |last6=Neven |first6=A K. |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7144 |pages=1563–9 |pmid=9596593 |pmc=28556}}</ref> 

Research at [[Guy's Hospital]] in 1999 linked one of the causes of colic to [[lactose intolerance]]. Transient lactase deficiency, a temporary lactose intolerance in young infants, has been shown to be a cause of colic in 40% of infants with the condition<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00304.x |title=Improvement of symptoms in infant colic following reduction of lactose load with lactase |year=2001 |last1=Kanabar |first1=D. |last2=Randhawa |first2=M. |last3=Clayton |first3=P. |journal=Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=359–63 |pmid=11906576}}</ref>.  Colicky babies fed milk pre-incubated with [[lactase]] enzyme showed a 45% reduction in colic symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00304.x |title=Improvement of symptoms in infant colic following reduction of lactose load with lactase |year=2001 |last1=Kanabar |first1=D. |last2=Randhawa |first2=M. |last3=Clayton |first3=P. |journal=Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=359–63 |pmid=11906576}}</ref>

Some have said that babies cry because they sense their mother's anxiety,<ref>{{cite book |title=Infant crying: Theoretical and research perspectives |editor1-first=Barry M. |editor1-last=Lester |editor2-first=C. F. Zachariah |editor2-last=Boukydis |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1985 |page=334 |isbn=978-0-306-41775-7}}</ref> but this is highly unlikely. They simply do not have the ability to distinguish a mother's anxiety from depression, frustration, etc. In fact, even though parental anxiety is markedly reduced with successive children, it has been shown that a couple's later children are as likely to be colicky as their first.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0163-6383(91)90024-M |title=Maternal unresponsiveness and infant crying across the first 9 months: A naturalistic longitudinal study |year=1991 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Frans O.A. |last2=Van Ijzendoorn |first2=Marinus H. |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=299}}</ref> It is plausible, however, that anxiety may have some relationship to crying through a more circuitous route. Anxious parents are often so unsure of themselves that they jump from one calming intervention to another without doing any technique long enough for it to be effective.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

What is clear is that there are various causes of colicky babies other than the obvious gassy causes:
*Fussiness peaks at about  6 weeks and reliably ends by 3–4 months, yet infants continue to experience plenty of burps, flatus, bowel movements, etc. well beyond 4 months of age<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13872677 |year=1962 |last1=Brazelton |first1=TB |title=Crying in infancy |volume=29 |pages=579–88 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref>
*Premature babies—with very immature intestines—have no more colic than full term-ers (despite the fact that their intestines are much more immature). And, when they do get colic it doesn't start until they reach their due date. (In other words, a baby born three months early has the same 10–15% chance of developing colic as a full term baby.)  Despite eating, defecation, burping and flatulating every day, he/she will have almost no fussing during the first three months.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.1996.tb12100.x |title=Crying Patterns in Preterm Infants |year=1996 |last1=Barr |first1=Ronald G |last2=Chen |first2=Shing |last3=Hopkins |first3=Brian |last4=Westra |first4=Tamme |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=38 |issue=4 |pmid=8641539 |pages=345–55}}</ref>
*Contrary to the belief that babies cry from swallowed air, X-ray studies reveal that when babies start wailing, they have much less air trapped in their stomachs than they do after the colic is over and they are calm and relaxed.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/adc.29.145.165 |title='Three Months' Colic' |year=1954 |last1=Illingworth |first1=R.

So they have more air in the stomach after crying, but it is totally innocuous.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}})

Some reports have associated colic to changes in the bacterial balance in a baby's intestine. They suggest treating the crying with daily doses of probiotics, or "good bacteria" (such as ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'' or ''[[Lactobacillus reuteri]]'').

In 2009, a U.S. study observed that colicky babies had a higher incidence of mild intestinal inflammation and a specific intestinal bacteria, Klebsiella.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.05.012 |title=Altered Fecal Microflora and Increased Fecal Calprotectin in Infants with Colic |year=2009 |last1=Rhoads |first1=J.

A study of prenatal maternal cortisol levels has validated the hypothesis of maternal stress as a potential cause of colic.

Insufficient physical contact after birth may be a contributing factor to infant colic. In a controlled experimental study, infants who were held/carried an extra two hours per day cried significantly less at six weeks of age than those who were offered two extra hours per day of visual stimulation.<ref name=Hunzinger>{{cite journal|last=Hunziker|first=UA|coauthors=Barr RG|title=Increased carrying reduces infant crying: a randomized controlled trial|journal=Pediatrics|year=1986|volume=77|issue=5|pages=641–648}}</ref> Another study found increased crying in infants whose mothers affirmed a perceived risk of spoiling young infants with too much physical contact.<ref name=Canivet />

[[T. Berry Brazelton]] has suggested that overstimulation may be a contributing factor to infant colic and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging overstimulation and helping the baby’s nervous system regain homeostasis.<ref name="Lester & boukydis">{{cite book|last=Lester, BM & Boukydis, CFZ, eds.|title=Infant Crying: Theoretical and Research Perspectives|year=1985|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=Brazelton>{{cite book|last=Brazelton|first=TB|title=Touchpoints|year=1992|publisher=Perseus|location=New York}}</ref> 

[[Aletha Solter]] corroborates Brazelton’s theory that some crying represents a beneficial discharge process, and has proposed a more general stress release theory of infant crying.<ref name="Solter 1995">{{cite journal|last=Solter|first=A|title=Why do babies cry?|journal=Pre- and Perinatal Psychology Journal|year=1995|volume=10|issue=1|pages=21–43}}</ref><ref name="Solter 2007">{{cite journal|last=Solter|first=A|title=A case study of traumatic stress disorder in a 5-month-old infant following surgery|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|year=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=76–96}}</ref> She has hypothesized six major contributing factors to infant colic: 1) Prenatal stress and birth trauma, 2) Unfilled needs (especially the need for physical contact), 3) Overstimulation, 4) Developmental frustrations, 5) Physical pain (including intestinal discomfort), and 6) Frightening events.<ref name="Solter 1995" /><ref name="Solter 2001" />  

Over the past 15 years, many thousands of babies have been given medicine in the belief that their colic was caused by painful acid reflux, so-called gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). From 1999–2004, the use of a popular class of liquid antacid (proton pump inhibitor, or PPI) in young children increased 16 fold.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MPG.0b013e31812e0149 |title=Proton Pump Inhibitor Utilization Patterns in Infants |year=2007 |last1=Barron |first1=John J |last2=Tan |first2=Hiangkiat |last3=Spalding |first3=James |last4=Bakst |first4=Alan W |last5=Singer |first5=Joseph |journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=421–7 |pmid=18030207}}</ref> And, from 2000–2003 there was a 400% increase in the number of babies treated with anti-reflux medicines. By all accounts this rate of increase has continued—or accelerated—from 2003 to the present.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In truth, most babies have mild reflux,{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} often referred to as "spitting up." Over the past 5 years, several studies have proven that GERD rarely causes infant crying. Even crying during feeding and crying accompanied by writhing and back arching is rarely related to acid reflux, unless the baby also has:{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
*1) poor weight gain (less than 15&nbsp;gram/day)
*2) vomiting more than 5 times/day; or
*3) other significant feeding problems.

A multicenter study, organized by researchers at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital, concluded that GERD medicine is no better than plain water at reducing infant crying. Surprisingly, 50% of fussy babies improved on medicine, but so did 50% of fussy babies given the placebo. In the meantime, research has shown that proton pump inhibitors can cause decreased bone density in adults.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ajg.2009.44 |title=The Effect of Proton Pump-Inhibiting Drugs on Mineral Metabolism |year=2009 |last1=Insogna |first1=Karl L |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=104 |pages=S2–4 |pmid=19262542}}</ref> No research has been done on bone density or growth in children given PPIs and this use is not approved by the FDA and should be considered experimental.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=="Red Flag"==
Babies who continue crying may simply be hungry, uncomfortable or ill. Parents who are unable to soothe their baby's crying must call their healthcare provider to make sure the baby is not sick. Fortunately, only 5% of colic cases are caused by illness (most commonly by intestinal allergy, described above).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9794970 |year=1998 |last1=Barr |first1=RG |title=Colic and crying syndromes in infants |volume=102 |issue=5 Suppl E |pages=1282–6 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref>

Parents should be especially suspicious of illness or pain as the cause of their baby's fussing if the cry is accompanied by at least one of the following six "red flag" symptoms:<ref name="Karp">{{cite book |last1=Karp |first1=Harvey |title=The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep Longer |location=New York |publisher=Bantam |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-553-38146-7}}{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

*Vomiting (vomit that is green or yellow, bloody or occurring more than 5/day)
*Change in stool (constipation or diarrhea, especially with blood or mucous)
*Abnormal temperature (a rectal temperature less than {{Convert|97.0|F|C}} or over {{Convert|100.2|F|C}}
*Irritability (crying all day with few calm periods in between)
*Lethargy (excess sleepiness, lack of smiles or interested gaze, weak sucking lasting over 6 hours)
*Poor weight gain (gaining less than  15&nbsp;gram a day)

Babies with persistent crying or any "red flag" symptoms should be checked by a healthcare professional to rule out illness. The top ten medical problems to consider in irritable babies with "red flag" symptoms are:<ref name="Karp" />
*Infections (e.g. ear infection, urine infection, meningitis, appendicitis)
*Intestinal pain (e.g. food allergy, acid reflux, constipation, intestinal blockage)
*Trouble breathing (e.g. from a cold, excessive dust, congenital nasal blockage, oversized tongue)
*Increased brain pressure (e.g., hematoma, hydrocephalus)
*Skin pain  (e.g. a loose diaper pin, irritated rash, a hair wrapped around a toe)
*Mouth pain  (e.g. yeast infection)
*Kidney pain  (e.g. blockage of the urinary system)
*Eye pain (e.g. scratched cornea, glaucoma)
*Overdose  (e.g. excessive Vitamin D, excessive sodium)
*Others (e.g. migraine headache, heart failure, hyperthyroidism)

==Effect on the family==
Infant crying can have a prominent effect on the stability of the family. Crying and the fatigue that typically accompanies it can inflict enormous emotional strain causing parents to feel they are providing inadequate care, triggering anxiety, stress, resentment and low self-esteem.<ref>Kirkland J. CrySOS, Cry Research Letter, 5:9-14, 1983{{vs|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Persistent infant crying has been associated with severe marital discord, postpartum depression, Shaken Baby Syndrome, SIDS/suffocation, early termination of breastfeeding, frequent visits to doctors, maternal smoking and over a quadrupling of excessive laboratory tests and prescription of medication for acid reflux.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Parents are at especially high risk of experiencing a serious reaction to their infant's crying; at-risk parents include teens, drug addicts, foster parents, parents of premies and parents of multiples. Families living in apartment buildings may also suffer strained relationships with neighbors and landlords if their babies cry loudly for extended periods of time each day.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Treatment==
Currently, the first approach most commonly recommended in healthy babies (without any "red flag" symptoms) is to use non-medicinal, noninvasive treatments like burping, stomach massage and gas release techniques as well as symptomatic and emotional support.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8065857 |year=1994 |last1=Wolke |first1=D |last2=Gray |first2=P |last3=Meyer |first3=R |title=Excessive infant crying: A controlled study of mothers helping mothers |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=322–32 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/000992280604500203 |title=Effectiveness of an Intervention for Colic |year=2006 |last1=Keefe |first1=M.

Some reports have associated colic to changes in the bacterial balance in a baby's intestine. These reports suggest treating the crying baby with daily doses of probiotics, or "good bacteria" (such as ''Lactobacillus acidophilus'' or ''Lactobacillus reuteri''). In one study,<ref name=pmid17200238/> 83 colicky babies given ''Lactobacillus reuteri'' had reduced crying time. After one week, treated babies had close to 20% less crying time (159 min/day vs. 197 min/day). By 4 weeks, treated babies had 74% less crying (51 min/day vs. 197 min/day). Overall, there was a 95% positive response to the ''Lactobacillus reuteri'' probiotic drops in colicky infants. However this study was not blinded so further studies are needed.

It has been an age-old practice to drug crying infants. During the second century BC, the Greek physician, Galen, prescribed opium to calm fussy babies, and during the Middle Ages in Europe, mothers and wet nurses smeared their nipples with opium lotions before each feeding. Alcohol was also commonly given to infants.<ref name="Solter 1998" /> 

In past decades, doctors recommended treating colicky babies with sedative medications (e.g. phenobarbital, Valium, ethanol), analgesics (e.g. opium) or anti-spasm drugs (e.g. scopolamine, Donnatal, dicyclomine), but all of these have been stopped because of potential serious side-effects, including death.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Another age-old practice recommended by doctors is the "cry-it-out" approach (also known as "controlled crying.") The "cry-it-out" approach refers to the practice of leaving crying babies in their cribs and letting them cry themselves to sleep. First recommended in the U.S. by [[Luther Emmett Holt]],<ref name="Holt 1919">{{cite book|last=Holt|first=Luther Emmett|title=The Care and Feeding of Children|year=1919|publisher=Appleton-Century|location=East Norwalk, CT|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15484/15484-h/15484-h.htm}}</ref> it was later also recommended by [[Benjamin Spock]] in his best-selling book, Baby and Child Care.<ref name="Spock 1976">{{cite book|last=Spock|first=B|title=Baby and Child Care|year=1976|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York}}</ref> More recently, [[Richard Ferber]] has recommended a modified version of this approach.<ref name="Ferber 2006">{{cite book|last=Ferber|first=RF|title=Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems|year=2006|publisher=Touchstone}}</ref>

Several pediatricians and psychologists have claimed that the "cry-it-out" approach is harmful to infants because it can interfere with the development of trust and secure attachment.<ref name="Solter 2001">{{cite book|last=Solter|first=A|title=The Aware Baby|year=2001|publisher=Shining Star Press|location=Goleta, CA|isbn=9780961307370}}</ref><ref name="Fleiss 2000">{{cite book|last=Fleiss|first=P|title=Sweet Dreams: A Pediatrician's Secrets for Baby's Good Night's Sleep|year=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref><ref name="Sears 2003">{{cite book|last=Sears|first=W|title=The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two (revised edition)|year=2003|publisher=Little, Brown and Company}}</ref><ref name="Gordon 2002">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=J|title=Listening to Your Baby: A New Approach to Parenting Your Newborn|year=2002|publisher=Perigree Trade}}</ref><ref name="Narvaez 2011">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=D|title=Dangers of "crying it out"|journal=Psychology Today|year=2011|month=November|series=Moral Landscapes|url=" http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out}}</ref> In a 1972 study (of non-colicky subjects) that suggested some correlation between maternal responsiveness to infant crying and a net reduction in crying episodes over the first year of a baby's life, Bell and [[Mary Ainsworth|Ainsworth]] suggest that this behavior derives from an evolutionary need (described generally by [[Attachment theory]]:  
<blockquote>the biological function of infant-mother attachment, and of both infant  attachment behaviors and reciprocal maternal behaviors, is protection from danger; and in the original environment of evolutionary adaptedness it was likely that predators were the most conspicuous danger. Attachment behaviors protect an infant by bringing him close to his mother, who can defend him from danger or help him escape from it. In a species in which an infant is as helpless as the human, attachment behavior could not effectively perform its protective function were it not dovetailed with reciprocal maternal behavior, activated either by the infant's signals or directly by danger or by both in combination. Infant and maternal behaviors are adapted to each other, and thus the environment to which an infant's attachment behaviors are adapted includes a mother who responds to his signals without undue 
delay.</blockquote>
They concluded that, in contrast to an earlier tradition of permitting children to "cry it out", that "maternal responsiveness promotes desirable behavior rather than "spoiling" a child. Infants whose mothers have given them relatively much tender and affectionate holding in the earliest months of life are content with surprisingly little physical contact by the end of the first year; although they enjoy being held, when put down they are happy to move off into independent exploratory play."<ref name="Bell 1972">{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=SM|coauthors=Ainsworth, MD|title=Infant Crying and Maternal Responsiveness|journal=Child Development|year=1972|month=January/February|volume=43|pages=1171–1190, 1186-87}}</ref>

There is evidence that leaving babies to cry alone can increase their emotional stress level. Researchers measured saliva cortisol levels in 25 infants during a sleep training program in which the infants were left to cry themselves to sleep over a three-day period. The infants’ cortisol levels were elevated when they were left to cry alone, indicating a state of high emotional stress. However, the cortisol levels remained high even on the third day, after the infants had stopped crying. This implies that, even though the sleep training program appeared to "work" and the infants fell asleep without crying, their stress levels were still high.<ref name="Misslemiss 2012">{{cite journal|last=Middlemiss|first=W|coauthors=Granger, DA, Goldberg, WA, Nathans, L|title=Asynchrony of mother-infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity following extinction of infant crying responses induced during the transition to sleep|journal=Early Human Development|year=2012|volume=88|issue=4|pages=227–232}}</ref> Another study found that even brief separations between mothers and their 9-month-old infants can result in elevated infant cortisol levels, indicating emotional stress.<ref name="Gunnar 1992">{{cite journal|last=Gunnar|first=MR|coauthors=Larson, MC, Hertsgaard, L, Harris, ML, & Brodersen, L|title=The Stressfulness of Separation Among Nine-Month-Old Infants: Effects of Social Context Variables and Infant Temperament|journal=Child Development|year=1992|volume=63|pages=290–303}}</ref>

#Sucking (Letting the baby suckle on the breast, a clean finger or a pacifier)

Although soothing techniques (such as movement, sucking, or shushing sounds) can lead to a short-term cessation of crying, it has been suggested that these techniques may serve only to postpone the crying.<ref name="Solter 2001" /> The absence of crying does not necessarily imply emotional well-being. It can also indicate [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], a state of psychological numbing seen in stressed or traumatized infants, during which stress hormone levels (such as epinephrine and cortisol) remain high, but the infants appear to be calm.<ref name="Solter 2007">{{cite journal|last=Solter|first=A|title=A case study of traumatic stress disorder in a 5-month-old infant following surgery|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|year=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=76–96|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/imhj.20123/abstract|doi=10.1002/imhj.20123}}</ref><ref name="Perry 1995">{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=BD|coauthors=Pollard, RA, Blakley, TL, & Vigilante, D|title=Childhood Trauma, the Neurobiology of Adaptation, and "Use-dependent" Development of the Brain: How "States" Become "Traits"|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|year=1995|volume=16|issue=4|pages=271–291|url=http://www.childtrauma.org/images/stories/Articles/state_trait_95.pdf}}</ref> Researchers have found that infants can have elevated cortisol levels in the absence of crying, while sucking on a pacifier.<ref name="Gunnar 1988">{{cite journal|last=Gunnar|first=MR|title=Adrenocortical activity and behavioral distress in human newborns|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1988|volume=21|issue=4|pages=297–310}}</ref>

Another approach to colic is the "crying-in-arms" approach, in which the parent lovingly holds the crying infant while letting the crying run its course (after all immediate needs have been met).<ref name="Solter 2001" /><ref name="Emerson 1989">{{cite journal|last=Emerson|first=WR|title=Psychotherapy with Infants and Children|journal=Pre- and Perinatal Psychology Journal|year=1989|volume=3|issue=3|pages=190–217}}</ref><ref name="Kitzinger 1989">{{cite book|last=Kitzinger|first=S|title=The Crying Baby|year=1989|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}</ref><ref name="Solter 2004">{{cite journal|last=Solter|first=A|title=Crying for comfort: distressed babies need to be held|journal=Mothering|year=2004|issue=122|pages=24–29|url=http://www.awareparenting.com/comfort.htm}}</ref> This approach differs from the "cry-it-out" approach because the infant is never left to cry alone. It also differs from the soothing approaches because the goal is not to cut the crying short, but rather to accept the crying and support the infant through it.<ref name="Solter 2004" /> The "crying-in-arms" approach is based on the assumption that persistent crying during infancy can be the result of accumulated stress or unhealed trauma (such as a traumatic birth), and that allowing the infant to cry in arms will provide long-term psychological and physiological benefits.<ref name="Solter 2001" /><ref name="Emerson 1989" /><ref name="Solter 2004" /> There appears to be some evidence for the effectiveness of the "crying-in-arms" approach, including an improvement in infant sleep.<ref name="Solter 1998">{{cite book|last=Solter|first=A|title=Tears and Tantrums: What to Do When Babies and Children Cry|year=1998|publisher=Shining Star Press|location=Goleta, CA|isbn=9780961307363}}</ref>   

In a breastfed baby, the doctor may suggest eliminating all stimulant foods (e.g. coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, decongestants, diet supplements, etc.) from a mother's diet for a few days to evaluate for improvements in the baby's condition. If food allergy is suspected, the doctor may suggest a hypoallergenic formula for a formula fed infant or, if the mother is breastfeeding, a period of elimination of allergenic foods (e.g. dairy, nuts, soy, citrus, etc.) from her diet in order to observe changes in the baby's condition.<ref name="Jakobsson" /><ref name="Evans" />  If the crying is related to a cow's milk allergy benefits are usually seen within 2–7 days. Mothers can then choose to add back small amounts of the suspected offending food a little bit at a time as long as persistent crying does not reappear. If crying reappears, the offending foods may need to be avoided for many months.<ref name="Forsythe" /><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11099588 |year=2000 |last1=Lucassen |first1=PL |last2=Assendelft |first2=WJ |last3=Gubbels |first3=JW |last4=Van Eijk |first4=JT |last5=Douwes |first5=AC |title=Infantile colic: Crying time reduction with a whey hydrolysate: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1349–54 |journal=Pediatrics |doi=10.1542/peds.106.6.1349}}</ref>

Persistently fussy babies with poor weight gain, vomiting more than 5 times a day, or other significant feeding problems should be evaluated by a healthcare professional for other illnesses (e.g. urinary infection, intestinal obstruction, acid reflux).<ref name="Heine" />
