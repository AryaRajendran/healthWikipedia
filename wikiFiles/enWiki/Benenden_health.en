==History==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[image:charles garland.jpg|frame|Charles Garland]] -->
The organisation that is now benenden health was founded in 1905 to help [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]] workers suffering from [[tuberculosis]] (TB). At that time TB was rife, especially among sorting clerks. It was killing many thousands of people a year. Only the very wealthy could afford medical help or a trip to a Swiss Sanatorium to recuperate in the fresh air.

One man had a radical idea to overcome the problem. '''Charles Garland''', a Post Office clerk himself, decided to create a mutual self-help organisation so that the less well off could get access to the healthcare they so desperately needed. Everyone would contribute a small weekly amount into a fund. It would be used to help their colleagues or themselves if they were unlucky enough to contract TB. In the early days, it was known as '''The Post Office Sanatorium Society'''.

In 1923, Civil Servants joined the organisation and it became '''The Post Office and Civil Service Sanatorium Society'''. Since then it has grown and developed into a modern healthcare organisation with its current legal name '''The Benenden Healthcare Society Limited''' and trading style '''benenden health'''.

''Ahead of its Time'', a film about benenden health's history was made by Trafalgar Productions in 2011.

benenden health's registered office and main HQ has been based in York since October 1990, it was previously based in London.

In June 2012, delegates at benenden health's Annual Conference in Manchester voted to remove the last of its membership eligibility criteria, meaning that anyone in the UK aged 16 and over can now join benenden health.

==Services==
benenden health can provide treatment for many conditions, as well as help with a wide variety of surgical procedures.

In a survey conducted by Progressive Partnership in December 2011, 99% of members surveyed were satisfied with the overall service provided by the Society.

benenden health members can receive treatment at benenden hospital or at benenden-approved private hospitals located across the UK.

[[Benenden]] bospital was founded in 1907 and became the centre for hospital treatment for members of Trade Unions and Friendly Societies and subsequently large numbers of public sector employees who joined what is now benenden health.  

The services provided at the hospital have moved with the times.  From treatment for [[tuberculosis]], which was its original role, to the management of chest diseases, to the current day where the hospital provides a wide range of consultation, diagnosis and treatment services for most medical and surgical specialties. 

In recent years the hospital has increasingly been able to provide services for patients who are not members of benenden health.  Local National Health Service agencies are increasing their use of the hospital's facilities, as are patients who use private medical insurance or who pay directly for their own hospital care. 

The hospital provides a range of clinical services which are tailored to meet the needs of individual patients.  The hospital has a Modern Matron – a senior and experienced professional – who has the authority to resolve problems and to make sure the 'patient pathway' is both effective and patient friendly. 

The hospital enjoys a beautiful location in the heart of rural [[Kent]] and yet is accessible by road or by rail from many parts of south and south east England.
