A '''general anaesthetic''' (or '''anesthetic''', see [[spelling differences]]) is a [[drug]] that brings about a reversible loss of [[consciousness]]. These drugs are generally administered by an [[Anesthesiologist]] to induce or maintain [[general anaesthesia]] to facilitate [[surgery]]. The biological [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|mechanism(s) of the action of general anaesthetics]] are not well understood.

==Mode of administration==
Drugs given to induce or maintain general [[anaesthesia]] can be either as gases or vapours ([[inhalational anaesthetic]]s), or as injections ([[intravenous]] anaesthetics or even intramuscular).  It is possible to deliver anaesthesia solely by inhalation or injection, but most commonly the two forms are combined, with an injection given to induce anaesthesia and a gas used to maintain it.

===Inhalation===
Inhalational anaesthetic substances are either [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[liquid]]s or [[gas]]es, and are usually delivered using an [[anaesthesia machine]]. An anaesthesia machine allows composing a mixture of oxygen, anaesthetics and ambient air, delivering it to the patient and monitoring patient and machine parameters. Liquid anaesthetics are vapourized in the machine. All of these agents share the property of being quite hydrophobic (i.e., as liquids, they are not freely miscible in water, and as gases they dissolve in oils better than in water).

Many compounds have been used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. [[Desflurane]], [[isoflurane]] and [[sevoflurane]] are the most widely used [[volatile anaesthetic]]s today.  They are often combined with [[nitrous oxide]]. Older, less popular, volatile anaesthetics, include [[halothane]], [[enflurane]], and [[methoxyflurane]]. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of [[xenon]] as an anaesthetic.

===Injection===
Injection anaesthetics are used for induction and maintenance of a state of unconsciousness. Anaesthetists prefer to use [[intravenous injection]]s, as they are faster, generally less painful and more reliable than [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] or [[subcutaneous injection]]s. Among the most widely used drugs are:

* [[Propofol]]
* [[Etomidate]]
* [[Barbiturate]]s such as [[methohexital]] and [[thiopentone]]/[[thiopental]]
* [[Benzodiazepine]]s such as [[midazolam]]
* [[Ketamine]] is used in the UK as "field anaesthesia", for instance at a road traffic incidents or similar situations where an operation must be conducted at the scene or when there is not enough time to move to an operating room, while preferring other anesthetics where conditions allow their use. It is more frequently used in the operative setting in the US.

==Method of Action==

General anaesthetics are often defined as compounds that induce a reversible loss of consciousness in humans or loss of righting reflex in animals. Clinical definitions are also extended to include the lack of awareness to a painful stimuli sufficient to facilitate surgical applications in clinical and veterinary practice. General anaesthetics do not act as [[analgesic]]s and should not be confused with [[sedative]]s. These drugs are a structural diverse group of compounds whose mechanisms encompasses multiple biological targets involved in the control of neuronal pathways. The precise workings are the subject of some debate and on-going research.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=Nicholas P.|title=General anaesthesia: from molecular targets to neuronal pathways of sleep and arousal|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=30 April 2008|volume=9|issue=5|pages=370–386|doi=10.1038/nrn2372}}</ref>

===Lipid theory===
It was postulated by Overton and Meyer that general anaesthetics exert their action by acting on the [[plasma membrane]]. This was supported by evidence that the potency of the drug has a direct, positive correlation with the lipid solubility of the blood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=100341 |title=Mechanism of action of inhaled anaesthetic agents |work=Anesthesia UK |year=2005}}</ref>

The mechanism of action was proposed to be increased fluidity of the membrane. The interpretation of the Overton and Meyer finding has been challenged and discredited.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ueda I |title=The window that is opened by optical isomers |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=336 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9915358 }}</ref>

===Ion channels===
General anaesthetics exert their action by the activation of inhibitory [[central nervous system]] (CNS) receptors, and the inactivation of CNS excitatory receptors. The relative roles of different receptors is still under much debate, but evidence has emerged for some targets being involved with particular anaesthetics.

Multiple anaesthetics have been found to affect the inhibitory GABA-A receptor, including [[propofol]], [[thiopental]] and [[isoflurane]]. However, xenon and nitrous oxide are thought to have no effect here. Glycine receptors have been suggested as putative target for at least the analgesic effect of inhalational anaesthetics.

2-pore-domain potassium channels, with the subfamilies TREK and TASK, have recently emerged as a potential target. These channels regulate membrane excitability, and halothane has been found to reduce neuronal firing by hyperpolarizing neurons by a current similar to TASK. Knockout mouse models have provided support for TREK-1. NMDA receptors, HCN channels and some sodium channels

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Induction===
Induction is between the onset of administration of anesthetic to surgical anesthesia. The speed of induction depends on the time taken for the drug to reach effective concentrations in the brain. IV anesthetic like Thiopental is generally used for induction.

===Elimination===
Volatile anaesthetics are eliminated in the terminal phase via the lungs. A low [[blood:gas partition coefficient]] is therefore necessary for quick removal of the anaesthetic. When the oil:water coefficient is high, there will be little anaesthetic in the blood, so elimination will be slow, giving a prolonged hangover effect.

Some drugs are metabolised by the liver, so consequently their metabolites are often toxic (e.g. [[chloroform]]).
