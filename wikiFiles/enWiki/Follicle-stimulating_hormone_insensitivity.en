'''Follicle-stimulating hormone''' ('''FSH''') '''insensitivity''', or '''ovarian insensitivity to FSH''' in females, also referable to as '''ovarian follicle hypoplasia''' or '''granulosa cell hypoplasia''' in females, is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorder|genetic]] and [[endocrine disorder|endocrine]] [[syndrome]] affecting both females and males, with the former presenting with much greater severity of symptomatology. It is characterized by a resistance or complete insensitivity to the effects of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), a [[gonadotropin]] which is normally responsible for the stimulation of [[estrogen]] production by the [[ovary|ovaries]] in females and maintenance of [[fertility]] in both sexes. The condition manifests itself as [[hypergonadotropic hypogonadism]] (decreased or lack of production of [[sex steroid]]s by the [[gonad]]s despite high circulating levels of gonadotropins), [[delayed puberty|reduced or absent puberty]] (lack of development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, resulting in [[sexual infantilism]] if left untreated), [[amenorrhea]] (lack of [[menstruation]]), and [[infertility]] in females, whereas males present merely with varying degrees of infertility and associated symptoms (e.g., decreased [[spermatogenesis|sperm production]]).<ref name="Sperling2008">{{cite book | author = Mark A.

A related condition is [[luteinizing hormone insensitivity|luteinizing hormone (LH) insensitivity]] (termed [[Leydig cell hypoplasia]] when it occurs in males), which presents with similar symptoms to those of FSH insensitivity but with the symptoms in the respective sexes reversed (i.e., hypogonadism and sexual infantilism in males and merely problems with fertility in females); however, males also present with [[ambiguous genitalia|feminized or ambiguous genitalia]] (also known as [[pseudohermaphroditism]]), whereas ambiguous genitalia does not occur in females with FSH insensitivity. Despite their similar causes, LH insensitivity is considerably more common in comparison to FSH insensitivity.<ref name="Sperling2008" />

==Cause==
FSH insensitivity is caused by inactivating [[genetic mutation|mutation]]s of the [[follicle-stimulating hormone receptor]] (FSHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to FSH. This results in an inability of the [[granulosa cell]]s in [[ovarian follicle]]s to respond to FSH in females, in turn resulting in diminished estrogen production by the ovaries and loss of [[menstrual cycle]]s, and an inability of [[Sertoli cell]]s in the [[seminiferous tubule]]s of the [[testicle]]s to respond to FSH in males, which in turn results in impaired [[spermatogenesis]].<ref name="Sperling2008" /><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009" />

==Signs==
In females, FSH insensitivity results in diminished development of ovarian follicles and granulosa cells and low to normal estrogen levels, elevated to very elevated gonadotropin levels, and low [[inhibin B]] levels, whereas males present with diminished Sertoli cell proliferation and moderately elevated FSH levels, normal to slightly elevated LH levels, normal [[testosterone]] levels, and reduced inhibin B levels.<ref name="Sperling2008" /><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009" /><ref name="Spiegel1998">{{cite book | author = Allen M. Spiegel | title = G Proteins, Receptors, and Disease | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=W3pFWZ69JeYC&pg=PA159 | accessdate = 10 June 2012 | date = 23 January 1998 | publisher = Humana Press | isbn = 978-0-89603-430-3 | page = 159}}</ref>

Due in part to elevated LH levels, which stimulate androgen production by [[theca cell]]s in the [[ovary|ovaries]], and due in part to FSH insensitivity, resulting in a lack of [[aromatase]] in nearby granulosa cells that normally convert androgens into estrogens, it could be expected that females with FSH insensitivity might present with symptoms of [[hyperandrogenism]] at puberty. However, this has not been found to be the case. This may be in part because FSH, via stimulation of granulosa cells and the resultant secretion of yet-unidentified [[paracrine signalling|paracrine factor]]s (but possibly including inhibin B), has been shown to significantly enhance the LH-mediated stimulation of androgen production by theca cells.<ref name="pmid11041762">{{cite journal | author = Barnes RB, Rosenfield RL, Namnoum A, Layman LC | title = Effect of follicle-stimulating hormone on ovarian androgen production in a woman with isolated follicle-stimulating hormone deficiency | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 343 | issue = 16 | pages = 1197–8 | year = 2000 | month = October | pmid = 11041762 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200010193431614 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200010193431614}}</ref><ref name="pmid18285408">{{cite journal | author = Wachs DS, Coffler MS, Malcom PJ, Shimasaki S, Chang RJ | title = Increased androgen response to follicle-stimulating hormone administration in women with polycystic ovary syndrome | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 1827–33 | year = 2008 | month = May | pmid = 18285408 | pmc = 2386684 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2007-2664 | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18285408}}</ref> In addition, theca cells predominantly secrete the relatively weak androgen [[androstenedione]], whereas granulosa cells, signaled to do so by FSH under normal circumstances, convert androstenedione into its more potent relative testosterone (which is subsequently converted into [[estradiol]]).<ref name="JonesLópez2006">{{cite book | author1 = Richard Evan Jones | author2 = Kristin H. López | title = Human Reproductive Biology | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=pfiZfui2XLIC&pg=PA38 | accessdate = 11 June 2012 | date = 17 March 2006 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-088465-0 | pages = 38-39}}</ref> Hence, in females, FSH insensitivity may not only result in deficiencies in estrogen production by granulosa cells, but in diminished androgen synthesis by both theca and granulosa cells as well, which could potentially explain why hyperandrogenism does not occur.

==Symptoms==
FSH insensitivity presents itself in females as two clusters of symptoms: 1) [[hypergonadotropic hypogonadism]] or [[hypoestrogenism]], resulting in a delayed, reduced, or fully absent puberty and associated [[sexual infantilism]] (if left untreated), reduced [[uterus|uterine volume]], and [[osteoporosis]]; and 2) [[gonadal dysgenesis|ovarian dysgenesis]] or [[premature ovarian failure|failure]], resulting in primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], [[infertility]], and normal sized to slightly enlarged [[ovary|ovaries]]. Males on the other hand are significantly less affected, presenting merely with partial or complete [[infertility]], reduced [[testicle|testicular volume]], and [[oligozoospermia]] (reduced [[spermatogenesis]]).<ref name="Sperling2008" /><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009" />

==Treatment==
[[Hormone replacement therapy]] with estrogen may be used to treat symptoms of hypoestrogenism in females with the condition. There are currently no known treatments for the infertility caused by the condition in either sex.
