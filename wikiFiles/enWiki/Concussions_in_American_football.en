While there have been efforts made to try to decrease the number of head injuries, according to Dr. Kevin M. Guskiewicz, there are about 300,000 sports related concussions every single year.  Also, after sampling 4251 football players, of those who suffered from a concussions, 6.5% suffered another concussion during the same exact season.  According to another study done by University of North Carolina showed that 31% of concussed athletes rushed immediately back onto the field after injury. This is showing that far too many times, players are being rushed back to the field too quickly. <ref name="NCAA Study">http://jama.jamanetwork.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/article.aspx?articleid=197667</ref>

==Concussions in the National Football League==
The NFL has been cracking down on concussions, with the league being more strict on player sanctions after [[Roger Goodell]] took over as league commissioner. The new policy expands the symptoms experienced by players suffering from concussions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/nfl-institutes-concussion-policy/story?id=9251126|title=NFL Institutes New Concussion Policy – ABC News|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> In {{NFL Year|2007}}, the league prevented players who were knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice, a policy that applied to [[Detroit Lions]] running back [[Jahvid Best]] in {{NFL Year|2009}}.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2011-08-22/lions-rb-jahvid-best-misses-second-practice-with-concussion|title=Lions RB Jahvid Best misses second practice with concussion – NFL – Sporting News|publisher=Aol.sportingnews.com|date=2011-08-22|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage, [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[dementia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/nfl-concussion-brain-trauma-lawsuit-players_n_1577497.html|title=NFL Concussions Mega-Lawsuit Claims League Hid Brain Injury Links From Players|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Mike|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/19085374/concussion-lawsuit-plaintiffs-an-eye-opening-cross-section-of-nfl-past|title=Concussion lawsuit plaintiffs an eye- opening cross section of NFL past – NFL – CBSSports.com News, Rumors, Scores, Stats, Fantasy|publisher=Cbssports.com|date=2012-05-18|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> Some teams have passed on various players in the [[National Football League Draft|NFL Draft]] due to their past concussion history. According to an ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' report, the HIT System was in question by the league, although [[University of North Carolina]] professor Kevin Guskiewicz said that the system is functionable in the league. However, former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] receiver and current [[NBC Sports]] analyst [[Hines Ward]] stated that the use of the system would be "opening a Pandora's Box", and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries.<ref name=HITS />

In November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study that was released by the ''Journal of [[Neurosurgery]]''  in which various [[football helmet]]s were compared with each other via [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]]. It was later found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather helmets did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/story/2011-11-03/leather-helmets-concussion-prevention/51070952/1 Study reveals leather helmets may help reduce concussions], USA Today, Erik Brady, 11/4/2011.</ref><ref>[http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/in-football-leather-helmets-could-provide-a-better-defense-against-concussion/#ixzz1u20uvfQf Why Leather Football Helmets Could Provide a Better Defense Against Concussion], Time magazine, Sean Gregory, November 7, 2011.</ref><ref>[http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2011.9.JNS111059?prevSearch=helmets&searchHistoryKey= Impact test comparisons of 20th and 21st century American football helmets], ABSTRACT, Journal of Neurosurgery, Adam Bartsch, Ph.D., Edward Benzel, M.D., Vincent Miele, M.D., and Vikas Prakash, Ph.D.,  Jan. 2012 (published online November 4, 2011).</ref>

In June 2012, a group of lawyers of 2,138 players have planned to file one single lawsuit against the league. According to an ''[[Associated Press]]'' report, over 80 lawsuits have been consolidated by the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8016911/former-players-combine-concussion-lawsuits|title=Former players to combine concussion lawsuits – ESPN|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2012-06-06|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> As of mid-August 2012, the number of players involved increased to 3,402.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glenn M.

In August 2012, the league sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. However, [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] ultimately sued the league on August 21 in a lawsuit called "Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., [[New York State Supreme Court]], New York County, No. 652933/2012." The company provided liability coverage for the league's merchandising arm (NFL Properties), and the insurer also pointed out that the abovementioned lawsuit has allegedly 14 counts against the league, while only two against NFL Properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ax |first=Joseph |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/news/travelers-sues-nfl-over-ex-players-brain-injury-184938731--nfl.html |title=Travelers sues NFL over brain injury lawsuits - Yahoo!

On April 9, 2013, a hearing in a federal courtroom in [[Philadelphia]] will be held, involving 4,100 paintiffs in 222 consolidated lawsuits, which is expected to last for the remainder of the decade. The NFL will argue that the legal system is not necessary for the hearing, and that the [[collective bargaining agreement]] handles the case. However, the players will state that the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, a committe of doctors, was formed independent of the CBA.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breer|first=Albert|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000158376/article/concussion-lawsuit-state-of-things-entering-tuesdays-hearing|title=Concussion lawsuit: State of things entering Tuesday's hearing|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2013-04-08|accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref>

==Concussions in college football==
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Post Comment |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/former-college-football-player-adrian-arrington-sues-ncaa-over-concussions |title=Former college football player sues NCAA in federal court over concussions - College Football News &#124; FOX Sports on MSN |publisher=Msn.foxsports.com |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> In 2011, former players [[Derek Owens]] and [[Alex Rucks]] filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety.

==Concussions in other leagues==
===Canadian Football League===
In the [[2010 CFL season|2010 season]] for the [[Canadian Football League]], there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reactcanada.org/EN/resources/articles/sport_specific/CFL_DELANEY.pdf |title=Concussions During the 1997 Canadian Football League Season |publisher=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine |format=PDF |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/argos/article/971336--cfl-concussions-not-always-revealed-to-fans |title=CFL concussions not always revealed to fans – |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2011-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of [[Football Canada]], [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS), the [[Canadian School Sport Federation]], the [[Canadian Football League Players Association]] (CFLPA), the [[Canadian Football League Alumni Association]] (CFLAA), and the [[ThinkFirst]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/985088--canadian-football-tackles-concussions-head-on |title=Canadian football tackles concussions head-on |publisher=thestar.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/article/working-to-promote-concussion-awareness |title=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref>
* Team physicians and therapists are to use a SCAT2 (a medical protocol), to diagnose concussions and preventing athletes from playing until they have been cleared to play.
* All players are to be submitted to IMPACT, which is a form of cognitive testing, during training camp.
* All player concussion assessments in the CFL are to only be used by team physicians and therapists.
* All coaches and players will receive educational items to aid in recognizing signs of a concussion.
* Administrators are to report a change from the expectation that a player returns to the game to one that encourages players to be honest about symptoms.
* The formation of certification programs that teach coaches how to recognize the symptoms of concussions.
* The formation of training programs for coaches that emphasize that players should never use their helmets to tackle.
* A new rule in the amateur football rulebook was implemented that requires officials to report suspected concussed players to the coaching or medical staff during games.

In 2012, ThinkFirst founder and [[Toronto Western Hospital]] neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the [[University of Toronto]], which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.<ref name=Study />

===Arena Football League===
In the [[Arena Football League]], despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former [[Colorado Crush]] kicker [[Clay Rush]] in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/sports/football/19concussions.html |title=Lawsuit Cites Mishandling of Football Concussions |author=Alan Schwarz |date=18 March 2010 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/more-sports/arena-football-league-adopts-strict-guidelines-on-concussions-296455/?p=0 |title=Arena Football League adopts strict guidelines on concussions – Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> In 2008, during the original league's [[2008 Arena Football League season|final season]], the "Shockometer" made its debut at two season-opening games ([[Dallas Desperados]] vs. [[Georgia Force]]/[[San Jose SaberCats]] vs. [[Chicago Rush]]) on 40 player helmets.

AFL Players Association regional director James Guidry stated that the red light doesn't mean that the player has a concussion, but as a warning for team examiners to inspect the player. Guidry also said that the device could be used to prevent players who don't want to show any signs of weakness after sustaining any concussion-like symptoms from continuing to play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/ |title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt’S-Shockometer / News |publisher=NFLPlayers.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>

==Prevention efforts==
Many efforts have been made to prevent concussions, such as a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] during the [[Arena Football League]]'s 2008 season called the "Shockometer", which was triangle-shaped with an adhesive on a side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a [[g-force]] which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. However, a possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-03-06/sports/arena06_1_schutt-rossi-players |title=AFL to test device designed to warn of possible concussions - Orlando Sentinel |publisher=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> [[Riddell]] created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games.

The country has gotten Congress to make sure that there are public-service announcements on head injuries and their detrimental effects.  Also, the NFL is now meeting with the brain injuries committee to see how they can find ways to keep players on the field, and concussions off.<ref name="Congress Gets Involved With Concussions"> http://go.galegroup.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA216411505&v=2.1&u=gain40375&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w </ref> In 2013, [[Reebok]] developed the Head Impact Indicator, which is a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Bill|url=http://www.nflevolution.com/article/Titans-QB-Hasselbeck-helps-Reebok-promote-Impact-Indicator?ref=3862|title=Titans QB Hasselbeck helps Reebok promote Impact Indicator|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2013-01-10|accessdate=2013-01-22}}</ref>
