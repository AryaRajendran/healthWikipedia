{{correct title|reason=namespace|title=N:C ratio}}
The '''nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio''' (also variously known as the '''nucleus:cytoplasm ratio''', '''nucleus-cytoplasm ratio''', '''N:C ratio''', or '''N/C''') is a measurement used in [[cell biology]].  It is a ratio of the size (i.e., volume) of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a cell to the size of the [[cytoplasm]] of that cell.<ref name="Turgeon">{{cite book | author = Turgeon, Mary Louise | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Clinical hematology: theory and procedures | edition = | language = | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Hagerstwon, MD | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 67 | quote = | isbn = 0-7817-5007-5 }}</ref>

The N:C ratio indicates the maturity of a cell, because as a cell matures the size of its nucleus generally decreases.  So, for example, "blast" forms of [[erythrocyte]]s, [[leukocyte]]s, and [[megakaryocyte]]s start with an N:C ratio of 4:1, which decreases as they mature to 2:1 or even 1:1 (with exceptions for mature [[thrombocyte]]s and erythrocytes, which are [[anuclear cell]]s, and mature [[lymphocyte]]s, which only decrease to a 3:1 ratio and often retain the original 4:1 ratio).<ref name="Turgeon"/>

An increased N:C ratio is commonly associated with precancerous dysplasia as well as with malignant cells.
