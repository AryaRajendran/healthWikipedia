'''Pediculosis pubis''' (also known as "'''crabs'''" and "'''pubic lice'''"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a disease caused by the [[pubic louse]] ''Pthirus pubis'', a [[parasitism|parasitic]] [[insect]] notorious for infesting human [[pubic hair]]. The species may also live on other areas with hair, including the [[eyelash]]es, causing pediculosis ciliaris. Infestation usually leads to intense itching in the pubic area.  Treatment with topic agents such as [[permethrin]] or [[pyrethrins]] with [[piperonyl butoxide]] is exceedingly effective.  Worldwide it affects about 2% of the population.

==Classification==
Infestation with pubic lice is also called phthiriasis or phthiriasis pubis, while infestation of eyelashes with pubic lice is called phthiriasis palpebrarum or pediculosis ciliarum.<ref>Manjunatha NP, Jayamanne GR, Desai SP, Moss TR, Lalik J, Woodland A. Pediculosis pubis: presentation to ophthalmologist as phthriasis palpebrarum associated with corneal epithelial keratitis. Int. J. STD AIDS 2006; 17: 424-426</ref> The disease is spelled with ''phth'', even though the scientific name of the louse is spelled with ''pth''.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptom is [[itch]]ing, usually in the pubic-hair area, resulting from [[hypersensitivity]] to louse saliva, which can become stronger over two or more weeks following initial infestation.<ref name=Review07/> In some infestations, a characteristic grey-blue or slate coloration [[macule]] appears (''maculae caeruleae'') at the feeding site, which may last for days.<ref name=Review07/> Nits or live lice may also be visible to the unaided eye.<ref name=Review07/>

==Parasitology==
{{Main|Crab louse}}
===Characteristics===
Pubic lice are between 1 and 3&nbsp;mm long with 6 legs.<ref name=Review07>{{cite journal |author=Leone PA |title=Scabies and pediculosis pubis: an update of treatment regimens and general review |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=44 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S153–9 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17342668 |doi=10.1086/511428 |url=}}</ref>

===Transmission===
Pubic lice are usually acquired by intimate contact between individuals.<ref name=Review07/> Parent-to-child infestations are more likely to occur through routes of shared towels, clothing, beds or closets. Adults are more frequently infested than children. As with most sexually transmitted pathogens, they can only survive a short time away from the warmth and humidity of the human body.

Infection in a young child or teenager is not necessarily indicative of sexual abuse, although this possibility should be kept in mind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klaus S, Shvil Y, Mumcuoglu KY |title=Generalized infestation of a 3½-year-old girl with the pubic louse |journal=Pediatr Dermatol|volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=26–8 |year=1994 |month=March |pmid=8170844 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1470.1994.tb00068.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Varela JA, Otero L, Espinosa E, Sánchez C, Junquera ML, Vázquez F |title=Phthirus pubis in a sexually transmitted diseases unit: a study of 14 years |journal=Sex Transm Dis |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=292–6 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12671547|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-5717&volume=30&issue=4&spage=292|doi=10.1097/00007435-200304000-00004}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A pubic louse infestation is usually diagnosed by carefully examining pubic hair for [[Louse#Biology|nit]]s, [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]], and adult lice.<ref name=Review07/> Lice and nits can be removed either with forceps or by cutting the infested hair with scissors (with the exception of an infestation of the eye area). A magnifying glass or a [[stereo-microscope]] can be used for the exact identification. If lice are detected in one family member, the entire family needs to be checked and only those who are infested with living lice should be treated.

Testing for other [[sexually transmitted infections]] is recommended in those who are affected.<ref name=Review07/>

== Treatment ==
===Pediculosis pubis===

Recommended treatments include the [[topical]] agents [[permethrin]] or [[pyrethrins]] with [[piperonyl butoxide]].<ref name=Review07/> [[Lindane]] is a second line treatment due to concerns of toxicity.<ref name=Review07/>  The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) states that lindane should not be used by persons who have extensive [[dermatitis]], women who are pregnant or lactating or children aged under two years.<ref>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Ectoparasitic infections. Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. 2006. MMWR Recomm Rep. 2006, August 10;55 (No. RR-11):79-80.</ref> The FDA similarly warns against use in patients with a history of uncontrolled [[seizure disorder]]s and cautious use in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, [[psoriasis]]) and in those who weigh less than 110&nbsp;lbs (50&nbsp;kg).<ref name="CDC">Lindane shampoo, USP, [http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2003/006309shampoolbl 1% prescribing information]. Updated March 28, 2003.</ref><ref>(FDA). [http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/lindaneaeredacted.pdf Lindane Post Marketing Safety Review (PDF)]. Posted 2003.</ref>

Bedding and clothing should be laundered and sexual contact should be avoided until cured.<ref name=Review07/> A second treatment is occasionally required if not improved after 3 to 7 days.<ref name=Review07/>

Pubic lice are primarily spread through sexual intercourse. Therefore, all partners with whom the patient has had sexual contact within the previous 30 days should be evaluated and treated, and sexual contact should be avoided until all partners have successfully completed treatment and are thought to be cured. Because of the strong association between the presence of pubic lice and classic sexually transmitted infections ([[sexually transmitted infections|STI]]s), patients diagnosed with pubic lice should undergo evaluation for other STIs.

===Pediculosis ciliaris===
Infections of the eyelashes may be treated with either [[petroleum jelly]] applied twice daily for 10 days or [[malathion]], [[phenothrin]] and [[carbaryl]].<ref name=Review07/>

==Epidemiology==
Current worldwide prevalence has been very approximately estimated at two percent of the human population. Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, because pubic lice infestations are not considered a reportable condition by many governments, and many cases are self-treated or treated discreetly by personal physicians.<ref>Anderson AL, Chaney E. Pubic Lice (Pthirus pubis): History, biology and treatment vs. knowledge and beliefs of US College students. Int. J. Envirn.Res.Public Health 2009; 6: 592-600</ref>

Although any part of the body may be colonized, crab lice favor the hairs of the genital and peri-anal region. Especially in male patients, pubic lice and eggs can also be found in hair on the abdomen and under the armpits, as well as on the beard and mustache, while in children they are usually found in eyelashes.

It has recently been suggested that an increasing percentage of humans [[Body grooming|removing]] their [[pubic hair]] has led to  reduced crab louse populations in some parts of the world.<ref>{{cite pmid| 16731684}}</ref><ref>Bloomberg: [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-13/brazilian-bikini-waxes-make-crab-lice-endangered-species-health.html Brazilian bikini waxes make crab lice endangered species], published 13 January 2013, retrieved 14 January 2013</ref>

==In other animals==
[[Human]]s are the only known hosts of this parasite, although a closely related species, ''[[Pthirus gorillae]]'', infects [[gorilla]] populations.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Biol |date=10 February 2009 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=20 |title=Apes, lice and prehistory |author=Weiss RA |pmid=19232074 |pmc=2687769 |doi=10.1186/jbiol114}}</ref>
