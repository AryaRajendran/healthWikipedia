'''Forensic pathology''' is a branch of [[pathology]] concerned with determining the [[cause of death]] by examination of a corpse. The [[autopsy]] is performed by a [[coroner]] or [[medical examiner]], usually during the investigation of [[criminal law]] cases and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases in some [[jurisdictions]]. Coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a corpse. Also see [[forensic medicine]].

The word [[forensic science|forensics]] is derived from the Latin ''forēnsis'' meaning ''forum''.<ref>{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}</ref>

== Scope of forensic pathology ==
Forensic pathology is an application of [[medical jurisprudence]]. The ''forensic pathologist'':
* Is a [[medical doctor]] who has completed training in [[anatomical pathology]] and who has subsequently sub-specialized in forensic pathology. The requirements for becoming a "fully qualified" forensic pathologist varies from country to country.  [[Forensic pathology#Becoming a forensic pathologist|Some of the different requirements are discussed below]].
* Performs autopsies/postmortem examinations to determine the [[cause of death]]. The autopsy report contains an opinion about :
**The pathologic process, injury, or disease that directly results in or initiates a series of events that lead to a person's death (also called mechanism of death), such as a [[bullet]] wound to the head, [[exsanguination]] caused by a stab wound, manual or ligature [[strangulation]], [[myocardial infarction]] resulting from coronary artery disease, etc.), and
** The "manner of death", the circumstances surrounding the cause of death, which in most jurisdictions include:
*** [[Homicide]]
*** Accidental
*** Natural
*** [[Suicide]]
*** Undetermined

* The autopsy also provides an opportunity for other issues raised by the death to be addressed, such as the collection of trace evidence or determining the identity of the deceased.
* Examines and documents [[wound]]s and injuries, both at autopsy and occasionally in a clinical setting.
* Collects and examines tissue specimens under the microscope ([[histology]]) in order to identify the presence or absence of natural disease and other microscopic findings such as asbestos bodies in the lungs or gunpowder particles around a gunshot wound.
* Collects and interprets toxicological analyses on body tissues and fluids to determine the chemical cause of accidental overdoses or deliberate poisonings.
* Forensic pathologists also work closely with the medico-legal authority for the area concerned with the investigation of sudden and unexpected deaths i.e. the coroner ([[England]] and [[Wales]]), [[procurator fiscal]] (Scotland) or coroner or medical examiner ([[United States]]).
* Serves as an expert witness in [[courts of law]] testifying in civil or criminal [[law]] cases.

In an autopsy, he/she is often assisted by an autopsy/mortuary technician (sometimes called a [[diener]] in the USA).

Forensic physicians, sometimes referred to as 'forensic medical examiners' or 'police surgeons' (in the UK until recently), are medical doctors trained in the examination of, and provision of medical treatment to, living victims of assault (including sexual assault) and those individuals who find themselves in police custody. Many forensic physicians in the UK practise clinical forensic medicine part-time, whilst they also practise family medicine, or another [[medical specialty]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], Membership of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]] is not a prerequisite of appointment as a Coroner's ''Medical Expert'', i.e. doctors in the UK that <!--THAT - not WHO - is used to distinguish between the two groups.-->are not forensic pathologists or pathologists are allowed to perform [[medico]][[legal]] autopsies, simply because of the vague wording of 'The Coroners Act', which merely stipulates a 'suitably qualified medical practitioner', i.e. anyone on the GMC Register.

== Investigation of death ==
{{main|Coroner}}
Deaths where the known cause and those considered [[unnatural death|unnatural]] are investigated.  In most [[jurisdiction]]s this is done by a ''"forensic pathologist",'' ''coroner'', ''medical examiner'', or hybrid ''medical examiner-coroner'' offices.

=== Terminology is not consistent across jurisdictions ===
In some jurisdictions, the title of "Medical Examiner" is used by a non-physician, elected official involved in medicolegal death investigation.  In others, the law requires the medical examiner to be a physician, pathologist, or forensic pathologist.

Similarly, the title "coroner" is applied to both physicians and non-physicians.  Historically, coroners were not all physicians (most often serving primarily as the town mortician).  However, in some jurisdictions the title of "Coroner" is exclusively used by physicians.

=== Canadian coroners ===
In Canada, there is a mix of coroner and medical examiner systems, depending on the province or territory. In Ontario, coroners are licensed physicians, usually but not exclusively [[family physician]]s. In Quebec, there is a mix of medical and non-medical coroners, whereas in British Columbia, there is predominantly a non-physican coroner system. Alberta and Nova Scotia are examples of ME systems <ref>The Coroner System. USW. [http://www.usw.ca/program/content/3179.php http://www.usw.ca/program/content/3179.php].

=== Coroners and medical examiners in the United States ===
In the United States, a coroner is typically an elected [[public official]] in a particular geographic jurisdiction who investigates and certifies deaths. The vast majority of coroners lack a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree and the amount of medical training that they have received is highly variable, depending on their profession (e.g. law enforcement, judges, funeral directors, emergency medical technicians, nurses).

In contrast, a medical examiner is typically a [[physician]] who holds the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]]. Ideally, a medical examiner has completed both a pathology [[residency (medicine)|residency]] and a fellowship in forensic pathology. In some jurisdictions, a medical examiner must be both a doctor and a lawyer, with additional training in forensic pathology.

== History ==
In German-speaking Europe, lectures on forensic pathology were regularly held in [[Freiburg]] in the mid 18<sup>th</sup> century and [[Vienna]] in 1804. Scientists like [[Auguste Ambroise Tardieu]], [[Johann Ludwig Casper]] and [[Carl Liman]] made great effort to develop forensic pathology into a science based on empirics.

Forensic pathology was first recognized in the United States by the American Board of Pathology in 1959.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckert WG |title=The forensic pathology specialty certifications |journal=The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology : official publication of the National Association of Medical Examiners |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=85–9 |year=1988 |pmid=3354533 |doi=}}</ref>

In [[Canada]], it was formally recognized in 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lett D |title=National standards for forensic pathology training slow to develop |journal=CMAJ |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=240–1 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17664437 |pmc=1930175 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070881 |url=}}</ref><ref>Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

== Becoming a forensic pathologist ==
Forensic pathology is a [[medical subspecialty|subspecialty]] of anatomical pathology.  Training requirements differ from country to country.

=== Australia ===
There are currently three paths to qualify as a forensic pathologist in Australia.  The first is to train solely in forensic pathology (although a significant amount of anatomical pathology knowledge is still required) and pass two examinations for forensic pathology only.  The second is to commence training in anatomical pathology, and complete an initial anatomical pathology examination, which takes a minimum of three years; then go on to train solely in forensic pathology and complete a forensic pathology examination, which takes a minimum of two years.  The third is to complete a minimum 5 years' training in [[anatomical pathology]] to qualify as a fellow in anatomical pathology, then complete a post-fellowship year in forensic pathology (a minimum twelve months further training plus successful completion of an examination).<ref>[[RCPA]] website [http://www.rcpa.edu.au www.rcpa.edu.au]. Accessed 30 January 2009.</ref>

=== Canada ===
In Canada,<ref>Residency Training Programs. [[Dalhousie University]]. URL: [http://pathology.medicine.dal.ca/anatomical.html http://pathology.medicine.dal.ca/anatomical.html]. Accessed on: 7 June 2007.</ref> anatomical pathology is a five year residency; Then residents who wish to become forensic pathologists must complete a one year fellowship in forensic pathology. Forensic pathology is a subspecialty by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. Currently, the only training program in Canada is in Toronto, with British Columbia, Manitoba, and Alberta possibly offering fellowships in the near future.

=== India ===
In India, the speciality is commonly referred to as Forensic Medicine or Legal Medicine. After completion of medical graduation (MBBS), one has to complete three years of study and training including thesis research, which leads to award of degree of MD (Forensic Medicine). One can also alternately pass the board examination conducted by [http://www.natboard.edu.in/ National Board of Examinations], leading to awarding of Diplomate of National Board (DNB).

The majority of the specialists are attached to the Department of Forensic Medicine in various medical colleges. The classification of posts includes Assistant Professor (Lecturer), Associate Professor (Reader) and Professor. The work profile of the specialists includes conducting autopsies and clinical forensic examinations; apart from teaching the medical students. They have to regularly appear in the courts as expert witnesses. A typical department in a government institution conducts 100 to 5000 autopsies a year depending upon the jurisdiction. Apart from this the clinical forensic examinations constitute a major part of the work and number of cases can run up to 10000 a year in an average institution.

The largest association of the specialty is Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine [http://www.iafmonline.com/] (IAFM), which also publishes its quarterly Journal of Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine [http://www.iafmonline.com/IAFMJournals.htm] regularly. This association has a specialist member strength of more than 1000.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, forensic medicine, also known as legal medicine (''"kedokteran kehakiman"''), is a 3-year specialty program that can be taken directly after completing medical school. It is separate from anatomical pathology and clinical pathology. Upon completion of the program, a forensic medicine specialist will obtain the title ''Spesialis Forensik'', or ''Sp.F''. He or she may be addressed in public as ''Dokter Forensik'' ("forensic doctor"). Note that there is no pre-medicine program, making the total duration of formal education for one to become a forensic specialist 8 years.

Forensic medicine is also a mandatory round during medical school clerkship. Medical students assist the doctors on autopsies, and they may also be allowed to perform an autopsy under supervision, and to witness in the court.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, anatomical pathology is a five-year residency. Successful candidates are eligible for inclusion on the specialist register of the [[General Medical Council]] (GMC) having obtained Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists (United Kingdom).

A specialist training (ST) post is applied for after the foundation year to enter a training program in Histopathology. Imminent changes as a result of the Tooke report may require two years or more to be fulfilled on general rotational placements before the option of histopathology arises. However, the Royal College have not yet issued their response to this matter. It is then necessary to obtain the MRCPath Part I examination in Histopathology, after which it is then possible to apply to one of few training posts in Forensic Pathology in the UK. Current approved centres include Belfast, Liverpool, Leicester, Cardiff, London, Sheffield, Glasgow and Dundee. Not all the posts are currently actively training. Following 3 years training in Forensic Pathology and completion of the FRCPath Part II slanted to Forensic Pathology you may then obtain CCT (certificate of completion of training) and work as a Consultant Forensic Pathologist. Another option is to obtain the full FRCPath in general histopathology, followed by another 18–24 months of training in forensic pathology, which will qualify the candidates with either the Diploma of the Royal College of Patholoists in Forensic Pathology (DipRCPath (forensic)), or the Diploma in Medical Jurisprudence (DMJ). In England & Wales you will also need to be Home Office Accredited, which will require checks of your training portfolio and completion of a security check and the Expert Witness Training Course run by the Forensic Science Service.

Foreign graduates and specialists need to apply to the GMC and the RCPath directly to practise Forensic Pathology in the United Kingdom.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], forensic pathologists typically complete at least one year of additional training (a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]]) after completing an anatomical pathology residency and having passed the "board" examination administered by The [[American Board of Pathology]] or The [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology]] ("board-certified"). Becoming an anatomic pathologist in the United States requires completing a residency in anatomic pathology, which is on-the-job training one must perform upon completing [[medical school]] before one may practice unsupervised. ''Anatomic pathology'' (as it is called) by itself is a three-year residency. Most U.S. pathologists complete a combined residency in both anatomic and ''clinical pathology'', which requires a total of four years.

In the United States, all told, the education after [[high school]] is typically 13–15 years in duration (4 years [[undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] training + 4 years medical school + 4–5 years residency [anatomic and clinical pathology combined] + 1-2 year forensic pathology fellowship). Generally, the biggest hurdle is  gaining admission to medical school, although the pass rate for anatomic and forensic pathology board examinations (in the U.S.) is approximately 80-90 and 90-100 percent, respectively. The courts do not require American Board of Pathology certification in order for a witness to be qualified as an expert in the field of forensic pathology, and there are several "diploma mills" that give online certificates in the field.<ref>[http://www.pathologyexpert.com/pxhowtofindexpert.htm Top 10 Things to Look For in Finding a Qualified Forensic Pathologist Expert Witness]</ref>
