The pyramid shaped '''maxillary sinus''' (or '''antrum of Highmore''') is the largest of the [[paranasal sinus]]es, and drains into the middle meatus of the nose.  It is present at birth as rudimentary air cells, and develops throughout childhood.

==Discovery==
The maxillary sinus was first discovered and illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], but the earliest attribution of significance was given to [[Nathaniel Highmore (surgeon)|Nathaniel Highmore]], the British surgeon and anatomist who described it in detail in his 1651 treatise.<ref>Merriam-Webster's Medical Desk Dictionary Revised Ed. 2002, pg 49.</ref>

==General characteristics==
Found in the [[body of the maxilla]], this sinus has three recesses: an alveolar recess pointed inferiorly, bounded by the alveolar process of the maxilla; a zygomatic recess pointed laterally, bounded by the zygomatic bone; and an infraorbital recess pointed superiorly, bounded by the inferior orbital surface of the maxilla. The medial wall is composed primarily of cartilage. The ostia for drainage are located high on the medial wall and open into the [[semilunar hiatus]] of the lateral nasal cavity; because of the position of the ostia, gravity cannot drain the maxillary sinus contents when the head is erect. The sinus is lined with [[mucoperiosteum]], with cilia that beat toward the ostia. This membrane is also referred to as the "Schneiderian Membrane", which is histologically a bilaminar membrane with ciliated columnar epithelial cells on the internal (or cavernous) side and periosteum on the osseous side.  The size of the sinuses varies in different skulls, and even on the two sides of the same skull.

The [[infraorbital canal]] usually projects into the cavity as a well-marked ridge extending from the roof to the anterior wall; additional ridges are sometimes seen in the posterior wall of the cavity and are caused by the alveolar canals.

The mucous membranes receive their [[postganglionic]] [[parasympathetic]] nerve innervation for [[mucus|mucous]] [[secretion]] originating from the greater petrosal nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). The superior alveolar (anterior, middle, and posterior) nerves, branches of the maxillary nerve provide sensory innervation.

The maxillary sinus may drain into the [[mouth]] via an abnormal opening, an '''oroantral''' [[fistula]], a particular risk after tooth extraction.
It is the largest air sinus in human body.

==Nasal wall/base==
Its nasal wall, or base, presents, in the disarticulated bone, a large, irregular aperture, communicating with the [[nasal cavity]]. 

In the articulated skull this aperture is much reduced in size by the following bones: 
* the [[uncinate process of ethmoid bone|uncinate process of the ethmoid]] above, 
* the ethmoidal process of the [[inferior nasal concha]] below, 
* the vertical part of the [[palatine bone|palatine]] behind, 
* and a small part of the [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]] above and in front.

The sinus communicates through an opening into the [[semilunar hiatus]] on the lateral nasal wall.

==Posterior wall==
On the posterior wall are the [[alveolar canals]], transmitting the [[posterior superior alveolar artery|posterior superior alveolar vessels]] and [[posterior superior alveolar nerve|nerves]] to the [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth. 

==Floor==
[[File:Pneumatized max sinus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The maxillary sinus can normally be seen above the level of the premolar and molar teeth in the [[maxilla|upper jaw]].  This [[dental radiography|dental x-ray film]] shows how, in the absence of the second premolar and first molar, the sinus became ''pneumatized'' and expanded towards the crest of the alveolar process (location at which the bone meets the gum tissue).]]
The floor is formed by the [[alveolar process of maxilla|alveolar process of the maxilla]], and, if the sinus is of an average size, is on a level with the floor of the nose; if the sinus is large it reaches below this level.

Projecting into the floor of the antrum are several conical processes, corresponding to the roots of the first and second [[molar teeth]]; in some cases the floor is perforated by the apices of the teeth.

==Pathology==

===Maxillary sinusitis===
Maxillary [[sinusitis]] is [[inflammation]] of the maxillary sinuses.

Maxillary sinusitis is common due to the close anatomical relation of the frontal sinus, anterior [[ethmoid sinus| ethmoidal air sinus]] and the maxillary teeth, allowing for easy spread of infection. Furthermore, the drainage orifice lies near the roof of the sinus, and so the maxillary sinus does not drain well, and infection develops more easily.

====Treatment====

The treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis is usually prescription of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic resistant to beta-lactamase, administered for 10 days.
