'''Early-onset Alzheimer's disease''', also called '''early-onset Alzheimer's''', or '''early-onset AD''', is the term used for cases of [[Alzheimer's disease]] diagnosed before the age of 65. It is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's, accounting for only 5-10% of all Alzheimer's cases. Approximately half the cases of early-onset Alzheimer's are [[#Familial Alzheimer's disease|Familial Alzheimer's disease]], where a genetic predisposition leads to the disease. The other incidences of early onset Alzheimer's, however, share the same traits as the 'late onset' form commonly referred to as "Alzheimer's disease", and little is understood about how it starts.

Non-Familial early onset Alzheimer's can develop in people who are in their thirties or forties, but that is extremely rare.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The majority of people with early-onset Alzheimer's are in their fifties or early sixties. 


==History of Alzheimer's disease==
{{Main|Alzheimer's disease#History}}

The symptoms of the disease as a distinct nosologic entity were first identified by [[Emil Kraepelin]], and the characteristic neuropathology was first observed by [[Alois Alzheimer]] in 1906. In this sense, the disease was co-discovered by Kraepelin and Alzheimer, who worked in Kraepelin's laboratory. Because of the overwhelming importance Kraepelin attached to finding the neuropathological basis of psychiatric disorders, Kraepelin made the decision that the disease would bear Alzheimer's name.<ref name="pmid9447568">{{cite journal |author=Weber MM |title=Aloys Alzheimer, a coworker of Emil Kraepelin |journal=J Psychiatr Res |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=635–43 |year=1997 |pmid=9447568 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-3956(97)00035-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022395697000356}}</ref>

==Familial Alzheimer's disease==
{{cn-span|text='''Familial Alzheimer's disease''' (FAD) or '''Early onset Familial Alzheimer's disease''' (EOFAD) is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's disease that usually strikes earlier in life, defined as before the age of 65 (usually between 50 and 65 years of age, but can be as early as 15) and is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, identified by genetics and other characteristics such as the age of onset. It accounts for approximately half the cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Familial AD requires the patient to have at least one [[first degree relative]] with a history of AD. Non-familial cases of AD are referred to as "sporadic" AD, where genetic risk factors are minor or unclear.|date=December 2012}}

While early-onset familial AD is estimated to account for only 0.035 of total Alzheimer's disease,<ref name="referenceX">{{cite journal |author=R J Harvey, M Skelton-Robinson, M N Rossor |title=The prevalence and causes of dementia in people under the age of 65 years |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=74 |pages=1206–1209 |year=2003  |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.74.9.1206|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/74/9/1206.full |issue=9 |pmid=12933919 |pmc=1738690}}</ref> it has presented a useful model in studying various aspects of the disorder. Currently, the early-onset familial AD gene mutations guide the vast majority of animal model based therapeutic discovery and development for AD.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Clinical features===
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of [[dementia]] and usually occurs in [[old age]]. It is invariably fatal, generally within ten years of the first signs. Early signs of AD include unusual memory loss, particularly in remembering recent events and the names of people and things, [[Logopenic progressive aphasia|logopenic primary progressive aphasia]]. As the disease progresses the patient exhibits more serious problems, becoming subject to mood swings and unable to perform complex activities such as driving. In the latter stages they forget how to do simple things such as brushing their hair and then require full-time care.

[[histology|Histologically]], familial AD is practically indistinguishable from other forms of the disease. Deposits of [[amyloid]] can be seen in sections of [[brain]] tissue. This amyloid protein forms plaques and [[neurofibrillary tangles]] that progress through the the brain. Very rarely the plaque may be unique, or uncharacteristic of AD; this can happen when there is a mutation in one of the genes that creates a functional, but malformed, protein instead of the ineffective gene products that usually result from mutations.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Genetics===
[[Image:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree Chart.svg|thumb|right|Familial Alzheimer disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.]]
Familial Alzheimer disease is caused by a mutation in one of at least 3 genes: [[PSEN1|presenilin 1]], [[presenilin 2]] and [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP).<ref>{{cite pmid|18802446}}</ref><ref name="cite pmid|19276785">{{cite pmid|19276785}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ncl.2007.03.009}}</ref> Other gene mutations are in study.

====PSEN1 - Presenilin 1====<!-- This section is linked from [[Delta catenin]] -->
The presenilin 1 gene ([[PSEN1]] located on chromosome 14) was identified by Sherrington (1995)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sherrington R., Rogaev E. I., Liang Y., Rogaeva E.

Mutations in this gene cause familial Alzheimer's type 3 with certainty and usually under 50 years old. This protein has been identified as part of the enzymatic complex that cleaves amyloid beta peptide from APP (see below).

The gene contains 14 [[exon]]s, and the coding portion is estimated at 60 kb, as reported by Rogaev (1997)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rogaev E. I., Sherrington R., Wu C., Levesque G., Liang Y., Rogaeva E. A., Ikeda M., Holman K., Lin C.

It also has an action on an amyloid precursor protein, which gives its probable role in the pathogenesis of FAD. Homologs of PS1 have been found in plants, invertebrates and other vertebrates.

Some of the mutations in the gene, of which there are over 90, include: His163Arg, Ala246Glu, Leu286Val and Cys410Tyr. Most display complete [[penetrance]], but a common mutation is Glu318Gly and this predisposes individuals to familial Alzheimer disease, with a study by Taddei (2002)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Taddei K., Fisher C., Laws S. M., Martins G., Paton A., Clarnette R. M., Chung C., Brooks W. S., Hallmayer J.

====PSEN2 - Presenilin 2====
The presenilin 2 gene ([[PSEN2]]) is very similar in structure and function to PSEN1. It is located on chromosome 1 (1q31-q42), and mutations in this gene cause type 4 FAD. The gene was identified by Rudolph Tanzi and Jerry Schellenberg in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy-Lahad E, Wasco W, Poorkaj P, ''et al.'' |title=Candidate gene for the chromosome 1 familial Alzheimer's disease locus |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5226 |pages=973–7 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7638622 |doi=10.1126/science.7638622 |url= | bibcode=1995Sci...269..973L}}</ref> A subsequent study by Kovacs (1996)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kovacs D.

''et al.'' | year = 1996 | title = Alzheimer-associated presenilins 1 and 2: neuronal expression in brain and localization to intracellular membranes in mammalian cells | url = | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 224–229 | doi = 10.1038/nm0296-224 | pmid = 8574969 }}</ref> showed that PS1 and PS2 proteins are expressed in similar amounts, and in the same [[organelle]]s as each other, in [[mammal]]ian [[neuron]]al cells. Levy-Lahad (1996)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy-Lahad E, Poorkaj P, Wang K, ''et al.'' |title=Genomic structure and expression of STM2, the chromosome 1 familial Alzheimer disease gene |journal=Genomics |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=198–204 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8661049 |doi=10.1006/geno.1996.0266 |url=}}</ref> determined that PSEN2 contained 12 exons, 10 of which were coding exons, and that the primary transcript encodes a 448 amino acid [[polypeptide]] with 67% homology to PS1. This protein has been identified as part of the enzymatic complex that cleaves amyloid beta peptide from APP (see below).

The mutations have not been studied as much as PSEN1, but distinct allelic variants have been identified. These include Asn141Ile, which has been identified by first by Rudolph Tanzi and Jerry Schellenberg in Volga German families with familial Alzheimer disease (Levy-Lahad et al. Nature, 1995). One of these studies by Nochlin (1998) found severe amyloid [[angiopathy]] in the affected individuals in a family. This phenotype may be explained by a study by Tomita (1997)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tomita T., Maruyama K., Saido T. C., Kume H., Shinozaki K., Tokuhiro S., Capell A., Walter J., Grunberg J. ''et al.'' | year = 1997 | title = The presenilin 2 mutation (N141I) linked to familial Alzheimer disease (Volga German families) increases the secretion of amyloid beta protein ending at the 42nd (or 43rd) residue | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 94 | issue = 5| pages = 2025–2030 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.5.2025 |pmid=9050898|bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.2025T | pmc = 20036 }}</ref> suggesting that the Asn141Ile mutation alters amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism causing an increased rate of protein deposition into plaques.

Other allelic variants are Met239Val which was identified in an Italian pedigree by Rogaev (1995)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rogaev E. I., Sherrington R., Rogaeva E. A., Levesque G., Ikeda M., Liang Y., Chi H., Lin C., Holman K.

====APP &ndash; Amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein====
[[Image:APP processing.png|thumb|300px|right|Processing of the amyloid precursor protein]]
Mutations to the [[Amyloid precursor protein|amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP)]] located on the long arm of chromosome 21 (21q21.3) causes familial Alzheimer disease.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Pathophysiology===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Following cleavage by [[BACE|β-secretase]], APP is cleaved by a membrane-bound protein complex called γ-secretase to generate Aβ. Presenilins 1 and 2 are the enzymatic centers of this complex along with nicastrin, Aph1, and PEN-2. Alpha-secretase cleavage of APP, which precludes the production of Aβ, is the most common processing event for APP. 21 allelic mutations have been discovered in the APP gene. These guarantee onset of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease and all occur in the region of the APP gene that encodes the Aβ domain.

====Genetic testing====
Genetic testing is available for symptomatic individuals and asymptomatic relatives.<ref name="cite pmid|19276785"/>

==Impact of Early-onset Alzheimer's==
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease can have devastating effects on the careers, caretakers and family members of patients.<ref name=mayo>Mayo Clinic staff, [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/alzheimers/AZ00009 Early-onset Alzheimer's: When symptoms begin before 65], ''[[Mayo Clinic]]''</ref><ref name=usatoday_20080902>Mary Brophy Marcus, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-02-early-alzheimers_N.htm Family shares journey after early Alzheimer's diagnosis], ''[[USA Today]]'' (September 2, 2008).</ref>

As many patients are in the age range common to those raising children, patients' children who are not full grown suffer physically and emotionally as their parents are no longer able to care for them.

Those who are working lose their ability to perform their jobs competently, and are forced into early retirement. When this can be predicted, employees must discuss their future with their employers and the loss of skills they expect to face.<ref name=cchs>[http://www.cchs.net/health/health-info/docs/2400/2498.asp?index=9592%20 Living With Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease], ''[[Cleveland Clinic|Cleveland Clinic Health System]]''</ref>

Those who are forced to retire early may not have access to the full range of benefits available to those who retire at the minimum age set by the government.<ref name=cchs/>

With some jobs, a mistake may have devastating consequences on a large number of people, and cases have been reported in which a person with Early-onset Alzheimer's who is unaware of their condition has caused distress.<ref name=cbs_20080308>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/08/eveningnews/main3919747.shtml Early Onset Alzheimer's On The Rise], ''[[CBS News]]'' (March 8, 2008).</ref>

People with Alzheimer's may also lose their ability to take care of their own needs, such as money management.<ref name=usatoday_20070611>Kathleen Fackelmann, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-06-11-alzheimers-cover_N.htm Who thinks of Alzheimer's in someone so young?], ''[[USA Today]]'' (June 11, 2007).</ref>
