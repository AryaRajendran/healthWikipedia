'''Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphoma''' (EATL), also '''enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma''' (ETTL), is a type of [[T-cell lymphoma]] that affects the [[small intestine]].  It is the most common primary gastrointestinal T-cell lymphoma, arising from the [[T cells]] that are found between the cells that line the small intestinal ([[Brush border|brush border cells]] or small intestinal epithelial cells).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Isaacson PG |title=Gastrointestinal lymphoma |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1020–9 |year=1994 |month=October |pmid=7927306 |doi=10.1016/0046-8177(94)90060-4}}</ref>  These cancerous T-cells are a consequence of prolonged, untreated [[coeliac disease]] in genetically susceptible individuals. 

==Epidemiology==
EATL is most frequent in Europe, where it represents 9.4% of all Peripheral T cell lymphomas. Association with celiac disease is consistently demonstrated in only 30% of patients. The global incidence of this lymphoma is rare, being about 0.5 to 1 per million.<ref name=pmid21566094>{{cite journal |author=Delabie J, et al |title=Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: clinical and histological findings from the International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Project|journal=Blood |volume=118|issue=148|pages= 148|year=2011|month=July}}</ref>

==Classification==
EATL can be classified as an extranodal Peripheral T Cell lymphoma, category it shares with Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma, and Panniculitic T Cell lymphoma. 
It can be further classified in type I and II EATL.<ref name=pmid21566094>{{cite journal |author=Delabie J, et al |title=Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: clinical and histological findings from the International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Project|journal=Blood |volume=118|issue=148|pages= 148|year=2011|month=July}}</ref> 

==Genetics==
Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is environmentally induced as a result of the consumption of [[Triticeae glutens]] (e.g. wheat gluten). In [[Gluten sensitivity|gluten-sensitive]] individuals with EATL, 68% are homozygotes of the DQB1{{HQBA|02}}  subtype at the [[HLA-DQB1]] locus .<ref name="pmid17470479">{{cite journal |author=Al-Toma A, Verbeek WH, Hadithi M, von Blomberg BM, Mulder CJ |title=Survival in Refractory Coeliac Disease and Enteropathy associated T cell Lymphoma: Retrospective evaluation of single centre experience |journal= Gut|volume= 56|issue=  10| pages = 1373|year=2007 |pmid=17470479 |pmc=2000250 |doi=10.1136/gut.2006.114512}}</ref> (See [[Coeliac Disease]], [[HLA-DQ]], [[HLA DR3-DQ2]]) [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5_and_gluten|A DQ isoform]] that appears to be responsible for EATL in the overwhelming number of cases is highly effective at presenting a proteolytically protected region of [[Gluten_immunochemistry#A2-gliadin|α2-gliadin]] to T-cells, constant over-stimulation of T-cell eventually results in neoplastic growth.<ref name="pmid17190762">{{cite journal | author = Jores RD, Frau F, Cucca F, ''et al.'' | title = HLA-DQB1*0201 homozygosis predisposes to severe intestinal damage in celiac disease | journal = Scand.

Beyond the RCD1 stage, many drugs are not effective, and undetected coeliac disease leading to ''de novo'' EATL generally has a poor outcome. 

The genetic association with celiac disease and HLA loci defines type I EATL. Type II doesn´t show these associations and frequently presents with bulky disease.

Early recognition of coeliac disease, particularly with a focus on DQ2 homozygotes and in affected family members, is the only effective prevention, though bone marrow transplant was suggested as a treatment during early RCD2.<ref name="pmid15696854">{{cite journal |author=Meijer JW, Mulder CJ, Goerres MG, Boot H, Schweizer JJ |title=Coeliac disease and (extra)intestinal T-cell lymphomas: definition, diagnosis and treatment |journal=Scand.

==Staging==
Bone marrow involvement is rare in this disease.

==Treatment==
EATL has mainly been treated with CHOP and CHOP-like regimens, the exposure to anthracycline drugs being a favorable prognostic factors.

==Prognosis==
According to the Peripheral T cell lymphoma project, median overall survival is 10 months, while median failure free survival is only 6 months. The international prognostic index is not useful in defining prognosis in this entity, but Peripheral Index for T cell lymphoma is. 
Among the most influential prognostic factors is bulky disease, defined by a tumor mass >5cm.<ref name=pmid21566094>{{cite journal |author=Delabie J, et al |title=Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: clinical and histological findings from the International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Project|journal=Blood |volume=118|issue=148|pages= 148|year=2011|month=July}}</ref>
