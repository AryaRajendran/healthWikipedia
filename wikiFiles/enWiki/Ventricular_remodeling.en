Chronic [[hypertension]], [[congenital heart disease]] with [[intracardiac shunting]], and [[valvular heart disease]] may also lead to remodeling. After the insult occurs, a series of histopathological and structural changes occur in the left ventricular myocardium that lead to progressive decline in left ventricular performance.  Ultimately, ventricular remodeling may result in diminished contractile ([[Systole (medicine)|systolic]]) function and reduced [[stroke volume]]. 

Medically speaking, "ventricular remodeling" implies a decline in function (even though the word "remodeling" usually implies improvement). Remodeling of the ventricles under left/right pressure demand make mismatches inevitable.  Pathologic pressure mismatches between the pulmonary and brain/systemic circulation guide compensatory remodeling of the left and right ventricles. The term "[[reverse remodeling]]" in cardiology implies an improvement in ventricular mechanics and function following a remote injury or pathologic process. 

Concentric hypertrophy is due to pressure overload, while eccentric hypertrophy is due to volume overload.<ref name="urlVentricular Septal Defect">{{cite web |url=http://cardiology.vetmed.lsu.edu/Education/CongenitalCardiacDisease/VentricularSeptalDefect/tabid/455/Default.aspx |title=Ventricular Septal Defect |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The [[cardiac myocyte]] is the major cell involved in remodeling. [[Fibroblast]]s, [[collagen]], the interstitium, and the [[coronary vessel]]s to a lesser extent, also play a role. A common scenario for remodeling is after myocardial infarction. There is myocardial [[necrosis]] (cell death) and disproportionate thinning of the heart. This thin, weakened area is unable to withstand the pressure and volume load on the heart in the same manner as the other healthy tissue. As a result there is dilatation of the chamber arising from the infarct region.  The initial remodeling phase after a myocardial infarction results in repair of the necrotic area and [[myocardial scarring]] that may, to some extent, be considered beneficial since there is an improvement in or maintenance of LV function and [[cardiac output]]. Over time, however, as the heart undergoes ongoing remodeling, it becomes less elliptical and more spherical. Ventricular mass and volume increase, which together adversely affect cardiac function. Eventually, [[diastolic]] function, or the heart's ability to relax between contractions may become impaired, further causing decline.

==Treatment==
Many factors influence the time course and extent of remodeling, including the severity of the injury, secondary events (recurrent ischemia or infarction), [[neurohormone|neurohormonal]] activation, genetic factors and [[gene expression]], and treatment. Medications may attenuate remodeling. [[ACE inhibitor|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors]] have been consistently shown to decrease remodeling in animal models or transmural infarction and chronic pressure overload. Clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction leads to improved myocardial performance, improved [[ejection fraction]], and decreased mortality compared to patients treated with placebo. Likewise, inhibition of [[aldosterone]], either directly or indirectly, leads to improvement in remodeling.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/348/14/1309 NEJM - Eplerenone, a Selective Aldosterone Blocker, in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction after Myocardial Infarction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Carvedilol]],a 3rd generation [[beta blocker]], may actually reverse the remodelling process by reducing left ventricular volumes and improving systolic function.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12783070; Effects of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers on left ventricular remodeling in chronic heart failure</ref> Early correction of congenital heart defects, if appropriate, may prevent remodeling, as will treatment of chronic [[hypertension]] or [[valvular heart disease]]. Often, reverse remodeling, or improvement in left ventricular function, will also be seen.
