'''Premature ejaculation''' ('''PE''') occurs when a man experiences [[orgasm]] and expels [[semen]] soon after sexual penetration and with minimal penile stimulation. It has also been called ''early ejaculation,'' ''rapid ejaculation,'' ''rapid climax,'' ''premature climax,'' and (historically) ''ejaculation praecox.''  There is no uniform cut-off defining "premature," but a consensus of experts at the International Society for Sexual Medicine endorsed a definition including "ejaculation which always or nealy always occurs prior to or within about one minute."<ref>Sharlip, I. D., Hellstrom, W. J., & Broderick, G. A. (2008). The ISSM definition of premature ejaculation: A contemporary, evidence-based definition. ''Journal of Urology, 179''(suppl), 340, abstract 988.</ref> The [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-10) applies a cut-off of 15 seconds from the beginning of intercourse.<ref name = Althof2007>Althof, S.

NY: Guilford.</ref>

Although men with premature ejaculation describe feeling that they have less control over ejaculating, it is not clear if that is true, and many or most average men also report that they wish they could last longer.  Men's typical ejaculatory latency is approximately 4–8 minutes.<ref name = Oxford2009/>  

Men with PE often report emotional and relationship distress, and some avoid pursuing sexual relationships because of PE-related embarrassment.<ref name=Barnes> {{cite journal |author=Barnes T., I.

==Prevalence==
Premature ejaculation is most prevalent [[sexual dysfunction]] in men; however, because of the variability in time required to ejaculate and in partners’ desired duration of sex, exact prevalence rates of PE are difficult to determine. In the “Sex in America” surveys (1999 and 2008), [[University of Chicago]] researchers found that between [[adolescence]] and age 59, approximately 30% of men reported having experienced PE at least once during the previous 12 months, whereas about 10 percent reported [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED).<ref name=Laumann> {{cite journal |author= Laumann, E.O., et al.|title= Sexual Dysfunction in the United States: Prevalence and Predictors |journal= Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=281 |page=537 |year=1999 |pmid=  10022110 }}</ref>. After age 60, ED becomes men’s most prevalent sex problem, however premature ejaculation remains a significant concern affecting 28 percent of men age 65–74, and 22 percent of age 75–85.<ref name=Laumann/> Other studies report PE prevalence ranging from 3 percent to 41 percent of men over 18, but the great majority estimate a prevalence of 20 to 30 percent—making PE men’s most common sex problem.<ref> {{cite journal |author= Mathers, M.J. et al. |title= Premature Ejaculation in Urological Routine Practice |journal= Aktuelle Urology (German)|volume=44 |page=33 |year=2013|pmid=  23381878}}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |author= Serefoglu E.C. and T.R.

There is a common misconception that younger men are more likely to suffer premature ejaculation and that its frequency decreases with age.  Prevalence studies have indicated, however, that rates of PE are constant across age groups.<ref name = Althof2007/>

==Mechanism of ejaculation==
{{Main|Ejaculation}}
The physical process of ejaculation requires two actions: emission and expulsion. [[Image:Mechanism of Ejaculation.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Mechanism of Ejaculation]]
The emission is the first phase. It involves deposition fluid from the [[ampulla of ductus deferens|ampullary]] [[vas deferens]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, and [[prostate gland]] into the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[urethra]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Böhlen D, Hugonnet CL, Mills RD, Weise ES, Schmid HP |title=Five meters of H(2)O: the pressure at the urinary bladder neck during human ejaculation |journal=Prostate |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=339–41 |year=2000 |pmid=10951500|doi=10.1002/1097-0045(20000901)44:4<339::AID-PROS12>3.0.CO;2-Z}}</ref> The second phase is the expulsion phase. It involves closure of bladder neck, followed by the rhythmic contractions of the [[urethra]] by pelvic-perineal and [[bulbospongiosus muscle]], and intermittent relaxation of external [[urethral sphincter]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Master VA, Turek PJ |title=Ejaculatory physiology and dysfunction |journal=Urol. Clin. North Am. |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=363–75, x |year=2001 |pmid=11402588|doi=10.1016/S0094-0143(05)70145-2}}</ref>

Sympathetic motor neurons control the emission phase of [[ejaculation]] reflex, and expulsion phase is executed by somatic and autonomic motor neurons. These motor neurons are located in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral [[spinal cord]] and are activated in a coordinated manner when sufficient sensory input to reach the ejaculatory threshold has entered the [[central nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=deGroat WC, Booth AM |title=Physiology of male sexual function |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=92 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=329–31 |year=1980 |pmid=7356224 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Truitt WA, Coolen LM |title=Identification of a potential ejaculation generator in the spinal cord |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5586 |pages=1566–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12202834 |doi=10.1126/science.1073885}}</ref>

==Intromission time==
The 1948 [[Kinsey Report]] suggested that three quarters of men ejaculate within two minutes of penetration in over half of their sexual encounters.<ref>{{citation|author=Kinsey, Alfred |title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Male |year=1948 |publisher=W. B. Saunders Co |location=[[Philadelphia]]}}</ref>

Current evidence supports an average [[intravaginal ejaculation latency time]] ('''IELT''') of six and a half minutes in 18–30 year olds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band137/b137-4.html |title=Ejaculation delay: what's normal?

Likewise, those with higher IELTs may consider themselves premature ejaculators, suffer from detrimental side effects normally associated with premature ejaculation, and even benefit from treatment.

==Diagnostic issues==
When deciding the appropriate treatment, it is important for physician to distinguish PE as a "complaint" versus PE as a "syndrome".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|last=Waldinger|first=MD|title=Changing paradigms from a historical DSM-III and DSM-IV view toward an evidence based definition of premature ejaculation. Part II: Proposals for DSM-V and ICD-11|work=Proposals for DSM-V and ICD-11|publisher=J Sex Med}}</ref>  About 20 years ago, PE was classified into "lifelong PE" and "acquired PE".<ref>{{cite web|last=Godpodinoff|first=ML|title=Premature ejaculation: clinical subgroups and etiology|publisher=J Sex Marital Ther. Vol15:130|accessdate=1989}}</ref> Recently, a new classification of PE was proposed based on controlled clinical and epidemiological stopwatch studies,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and it included 2 other PE syndromes: "natural variable PE" and "premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction".  Only individuals with lifelong PE with IELT shorter than 1–1.5 minutes should require medication as a first option, along with or without therapy.  For those who fall into one of the other categories, treatment should consist of patient reassurance, behavior therapy, and/or psychoeducation to explain irregular early ejaculation is a normal variation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Waldinger|first=Marcel D.|title=New Insights in Premature Ejaculation|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-5/content/article/10168/54676|work=Psychiatric Times Vol. 24 No. 9|publisher=Psychiatric Times|accessdate=1 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Serefoglu|first=EC|coauthors=Yaman O, Cayan S, et al.|title=Prevalence of the complaint of ejaculating prematurely and the four premature ejaculation syndromes|journal=J Sex Med|year=2011|issue=8|pages=540–8}}</ref>

Several possible subclassifications have been discussed, but none is in universal usage.  ''Primary premature ejaculation'' refers to lifelong experience of the problem (since puberty), and ''secondary premature ejaculation'' reference to the problem beginning later in life.  It has also been subdivided into ''global premature ejaculation'', when it occurs with all partners and contexts, and ''situational premature ejaculation,'' when it occurs in some situations or with specific partners.<ref>Godpodinoff M.L. ''Premature Ejaculation: Clinical Subgroups and Etiology'' Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy 1989; 15(2):130-134</ref>

==Causes==
The causes of premature ejaculation are unclear. Many theories have been suggested, including that PE was the result of masturbating quickly during adolescence to avoid being caught by an adult, of performance anxiety, of an unresolved Oedipal conflict, of passive-aggressiveness, and having too little sex—but there is little evidence to support any of these theories.<ref name = Oxford2009>Strassberg, D. S., & Perelman, M. A. (2009). Sexual dysfunctions. In P. H. Blaney & T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford textbook of psychopathology'' (2nd ed.), (pp. 399–430).  NY: Oxford University Press.</ref>

Several physiological mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to causing premature ejaculation including [[serotonin]] receptors, a genetic predisposition, elevated penile sensitivity, and nerve conduction atypicalities.<ref name = Althof2007/> 

The nucleus paragigantocellularis of the brain has been identified as involved in ejaculatory control.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coolen LM, Olivier B, Peters HJ, Veening JG |title=Demonstration of ejaculation-induced neural activity in the male rat brain using 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=881–91 |year=1997 |pmid=9284512 |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(97)00258-8}}</ref> Scientists have long suspected a [[genetics|genetic]] link to certain forms of premature ejaculation. In one study, ninety-one percent of men who have had premature ejaculation for their entire lives also had a first-relative with lifelong premature ejaculation. Other researchers have noted that men who have premature ejaculation have a faster neurological response in the pelvic muscles.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

PE may be caused by prostatitis<ref name=Althof2010/> or as a drug side effect.

==Treatments==
Several treatments have been tested for treating premature ejaculation.  A combination of medication and non-medication treatments is often the most effective method.<ref name = LeVay>LeVay, S., & Baldwin, J. (2009). ''Human sexuality'' (3rd. ed.) (pp. 532–534). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer.</ref>

===Self-treatment===
Many men attempt to treat themselves for premature ejaculation by trying to distract themselves, such as by trying to focus their attention away from the sexual stimulation.  There is little evidence to indicate that it is effective, however.  Other self-treatments include thrusting more slowly, withdrawing the penis altogether, purposefully ejaculating before sexual intercourse, and using more than one condom.  Some men report these to have been helpful.<ref name = Oxford2009/>

By the 21st century, most men with premature ejaculation could cure themselves, either solo or with a partner, using self-help resources, and only those with unusually severe problems had to consult sex therapists, who cured 75 to 80 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |author= McCabe, M.P.|title= Evaluation of a Cognitive Behavior Therapy Program for People with Sexual Dysfunction |journal= Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=27 |page=259|year=2001|pmid=11354931}}</ref><ref name=Chen/>

===Psychoanalysis===
[[Freudian]] theory postulated that rapid ejaculation was a symptom of underlying [[neurosis]]. The man suffers unconscious hostility toward women, so he ejaculates rapidly, which satisfies him but frustrates his lover, who is unlikely to experience [[orgasm]] that quickly.<ref name=Kaplan/> Freudians claimed that premature ejaculation could be cured using psychoanalysis. But even years of psychoanalysis accomplished little, if anything, in curing premature ejaculation.<ref name=Kaplan>{{citation|author= Kaplan, Helen S. |title= PE: How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation |page=28 |year=1989 |publisher=Brunner Mazel/New York Times}}</ref>

There is no evidence that men with premature ejaculation harbor unusual hostility toward women, however.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Sex therapy===
Several techniques have been developed and applied by sex therapists, including [[Kegel exercise]]s (to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor) and Masters and Johnson's "stop-start technique" (to desensitize the man's responses) and "squeeze technique" (to reduce excessive arousal)<ref name = LeVay/>

To treat premature ejaculation, Masters and Johnson developed the “squeeze technique.” Men were instructed to pay close attention to their arousal pattern and learn to recognize how they felt shortly before their “point of no return,” the moment ejaculation felt imminent and inevitable. Sensing the point of no return, they were to signal the partner, who squeezed the head of the penis between thumb and index finger, suppressing the ejaculatory reflex and allowing the man to last longer.<ref>{{citation|author=Castleman, M. |title=Great Sex|year=2004|pages=137-138 |publisher=[[Rodale, Inc.]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Masters, W. and V. Johnson |title= Human Sexual Inadequacy |year=1970| |publisher=[[ Little Brown & Company]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Belliveau, F. and L. Richter |title= Understanding Human Sexual Inadequacy |year=1970| |publisher=[[ Hodder and Stoughton]] }}</ref> 
		
The squeeze technique worked, but many couples found it cumbersome. From the 1970s to the 1990s, sex therapists refined the Masters and Johnson approach, largely abandoning the squeeze technique and basing the program on a simpler and more effective technique,  “stop-start.” During intercourse, as the man senses he’s approaching his point of no return, both lovers stop moving and remain still until the man’s feelings of ejaculatory inevitability subside, at which point, they are free to resume active intercourse. <ref>{{citation|author=Castleman, M. |title=Great Sex|year=2004|pages=136-137 |publisher=[[Rodale, Inc.]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Kaplan, Helen S. |title= PE: How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation |pages=48-58 |year=1989 |publisher=Brunner Mazel/New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Metz, M. and B.

R.W.|title= A Short Book About Lasting Longer|pages=27-38|year=2007 |publisher= PEC Publishing }}</ref>
 
In addition to the stop-start technique, other sexual adjustments help men develop and maintain ejaculatory control, among them: masturbation exercises, deep breathing, and whole-body massage. Sex therapists estimate that the refined last-longer program teaches effective ejaculatory control to 90 percent of men.<ref>{{citation|author=Castleman, M. |title=Great Sex|year=2004|pages=122-141 |publisher=[[Rodale, Inc.]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Kaplan, Helen S. |title= PE: How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation |pages=43-61 |year=1989 |publisher=Brunner Mazel/New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Metz, M. and B.

===Medications===
Drugs that increase serotonin signalling in the brain slow ejaculation and have been used successfully to treat PI.  These include [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), such as [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), and [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), as well as [[clomipramine]] (Anafranil).  Ejaculatory delay typically begins within a week of beginning medication. The treatments increase the ejaculatory delay to 6–20 times greater than before medication.  Although men often report satisfaction with treatment by medication, many men discontinue it within a year.<ref name=Althof2007/>  

[[Dapoxetine]] (Priligy) is a short-acting SSRI marketed for the treatment of premature ejaculation.<ref name="pmid18360636">{{cite journal |author=Kendirci M, Salem E, Hellstrom WJ |title=Dapoxetine, a novel selective serotonin transport inhibitor for the treatment of premature ejaculation |journal=Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=277–89 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=18360636 |doi= 10.2147/tcrm.2007.3.2.277|url= |pmc=1936309}}</ref> Dapoxetine is the only drug with regulatory approval for such an indication. Currently, it is approved in several European countries, including Finland, Sweden, Portugal, Austria and Germany.<ref>[http://www.presseecho.de/vermischtes/NA3731393429.htm PRILIGY (Dapoxetin) erhält die Zulassung für die Behandlung der Ejaculatio praecox in Deutschland]</ref><ref name="tmnews">[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2170588/ Janssen-Cilag EMEA announces receipt of first regulatory approvals for Priligy for PE in Finland and Sweden], February 11, 2009</ref> Dapoxetine is currently waiting for [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval after concluding the [[Phase III]] study, which included participants from 25 other countries, including the United States.  In this diverse population, dapoxetine significantly improved all aspects of PE and was generally well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McMahon|first=CG|coauthors=Althof, SE, Kaufman, JM, Buvat, J, Levine, SB, Aquilina, JW, Tesfaye, F, Rothman, M, Rivas, DA, Porst, H|title=Efficacy and safety of dapoxetine for the treatment of premature ejaculation: integrated analysis of results from five phase 3 trials.|journal=The journal of sexual medicine|date=2011 Feb|volume=8|issue=2|pages=524–39|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02097.x.|pmid=21059176}}</ref>

[[Paroxetine]] (Paxil) appears to be the most effective drug treatment.  In a 6-week long randomized, double-blind study, the ejaculatory latency of men with PE increased from an average 20 seconds to 2-1/2 minutes, whereas there as no change at all in the placebo group.<ref name = LeVay/>  

[[Tramadol]] (Ultram or Tramal) is an FDA-approved atypical oral analgesic generally used to treat mild pain.  Tramadol also has few side effects, low abuse potential, and increases ejaculatory latency to 4-20 times in more than 90% of men tested.<ref>Kaynar, M. & Abdel-Hamid, I.A. (2012). On-Demand Tramadol Hypochloride Use in Premature Ejaculation Treatment. ''Journal of Urology, 71, 145-149.</ref> 

[[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil) is sometimes prescribed to treat PE.  One side effect of the drug can help delay ejaculatory response. The side effect is described by the Mayo Clinic as "Increased {{sic}} sexual ability, desire, drive, or performance."<ref>{{cite web|title=Clomipramine Side Effects|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR602715/DSECTION=side-effects|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> 

Desensitizing topical medications that are applied to the tip and shaft of the penis can also be used. These are applied "as needed," 10–15 minutes before sexual activity and have fewer potential systemic side effects as compared to pills.<ref>An overview of pharmacotherapy in premature ejaculation.

==History==
Ejaculatory control issues have been documented for more than 1,500 years. The [[Kamasutra]], the 4th century Indian sex handbook, declares: “Women love the man whose sexual energy lasts a long time, but they resent a man whose energy ends quickly because he stops before they reach a climax.”<ref>{{citation|author= Vatsyayana, M. (translators) Doniger, W. and Kakar, S.|title= Kamasutra |year=2009 |publisher=[[ Oxford University Press]] }}</ref>

Nineteenth-century authorities considered rapid ejaculation a sign of masculine vigor.{{cn|date=May 2013}} 

Non-human [[mammals]] ejaculate quickly during intercourse, prompting [[biologists]] to declare that rapid ejaculation had [[evolved]] into men’s genetic makeup to increase their chances of passing their [[genes]].<ref name="Birch">{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Birch |title=Did you orgasm?|publisher=Sexualhealth.com|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=21 April 2010|url=http://www.sexualhealth.com/article/read/women-sexual-health/orgasm/486/|archivedate=16 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716044630/http://www.sexualhealth.com/article/read/women-sexual-health/orgasm/486/}}</ref>
