'''Concussion grading systems''' are sets of criteria used in sports medicine to determine the severity, or grade, of a [[concussion]], the mildest form of [[traumatic brain injury]]. At least 16 such systems exist,<ref name="hayden">

}}
</ref> Several of the systems use [[loss of consciousness]] and [[amnesia]] as the primary determinants of the severity of the concussion.<ref name=cantu01/>

The systems are widely used to determine when it is safe to allow an athlete to return to competition.  Concern exists that multiple concussions received in a short time may present an added danger, since an initial concussion may leave the brain in a vulnerable state for a time.  Injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during rest and exertion and their [[neuropsychological test]]s are normal again, in order to avoid a risk of cumulative effects such as decline in mental function and [[second-impact syndrome]], which may occur on very rare occasions after a concussion that occurs before the symptoms from another concussion have resolved.

It is estimated that over 40% of high school athletes return to action prematurely<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/03/concussions.teen.brains/index.html Concussions Extra Dangerous to Teen Brains, CNN, 4 February 2010]</ref> and over 40,000 youth concussions occur annually.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/233115 Heading Off Sports Injuries, Newsweek, 5 Feb 2010]</ref>  Concussions account for nearly 10% of sport injuries, and are the second leading cause of brain injury for young people ages 15–24.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-05-04-concussions_N.htm High School Athletes Face Serious Concussion Risks, USA Today, 4 May 2009]</ref>

Three grading systems are followed most widely: one was developed by Robert Cantu, one by the [[Colorado Medical Society]], and a third by the  [[American Academy of Neurology]].<ref name=cobb>

==Cantu guidelines==
The Cantu guidelines, published in 1986 by Dr. Robert Cantu of Boston University,<ref name=cantu01/> classify an injury associated with no loss of consciousness and less than 30&nbsp;minutes of post-traumatic amnesia as grade&nbsp;I. In grade&nbsp;II, the patient loses consciousness for less than 5&nbsp;minutes or experiences amnesia for between 30&nbsp;minutes and 24&nbsp;hours. In grade&nbsp;III, loss of consciousness lasts longer than 5&nbsp;minutes or amnesia lasts longer than 24&nbsp;hours.<ref name=cantu01/> The most commonly seen type of concussion is a grade&nbsp;I by this guideline.<ref name="Terrell">
{{cite journal |author=Terrell TR |title=Concussion in Athletes |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=837–42 |year=2004 |pmid=15455966 |url=http://www.sma.org/pdfs/objecttypes/smj/2438A51C-BCD4-FF26-DE27672C13233C44/Concussion%20in%20Athletes.pdf|format=PDF |doi=10.1097/01.SMJ.0000140091.58338.1E
}}
</ref>

In a 2001 update, Cantu changed the guidelines to include other concussion signs and symptoms in addition to amnesia in the grading criteria.<ref name=cantu01/> He also changed the grade&nbsp;II criteria to include only concussions with loss of consciousness for less than 1&nbsp;minute, and included those with loss of consciousness for greater than 1&nbsp;minute, or with signs or symptoms lasting over a week, under grade&nbsp;III.<ref name=cantu01/>  More than one grade&nbsp;III concussion during a professional or collegiate athlete's career may lead health professionals to recommend that the player cease playing the sport.<ref name="Terrell"/>

Cantu, a medical doctor, clinical professor of neurosurgery at [[Boston University School of Medicine]] and co-founder in 2008 and co-director of the [[Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy]] at BUSM, is also senior advisor to the [[National Football League|NFL]] Head, Neck and Spine Committee.<ref>[http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm-news/2010/08/17/researchers-discover-brain-trauma-in-sports-may-cause-a-new-disease-that-mimics-als/ "Researchers Discover Brain Trauma in Sports May Cause a New Disease That Mimics ALS"], BUSM press release, August 17th, 2010 3:41 pm.

==Colorado Medical Society guidelines==
The Colorado Medical Society guidelines were published in 1991 in response to the death of a high school athlete due to what was thought to be second-impact syndrome.<ref name="Zasler">

</ref>  According to the guidelines, a grade&nbsp;I concussion consists of confusion only, grade&nbsp;II includes confusion and post-traumatic amnesia, and grade&nbsp;III and IV involve a loss of consciousness.<ref name=cantu01/>

By these guidelines, an athlete who has suffered a concussion may return to sports after having been free of symptoms, both at rest and during exercise, as shown in the following table:<ref name="Heads up">

==American Academy of Neurology guidelines==
The guidelines devised in 1997 by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) are based on those by the Colorado Medical Society.<ref name=Silver05>
{{cite book| author=Silver JM, McAllister TW, Yudofsky SC |year=2005| title=Textbook Of Traumatic Brain Injury |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub., Inc |isbn=1-58562-105-6
}}
</ref>  According to these guidelines, a grade&nbsp;I concussion is associated with no loss of consciousness and symptoms of confusion last less than 15&nbsp;minutes.  Grade&nbsp;II is the same, except symptoms last longer than 15&nbsp;minutes. In grade&nbsp;III, loss of consciousness does occur.<ref name=cantu01/>  Grade&nbsp;III can be further divided into grades&nbsp;IIIa and IIIb, with brief loss of consciousness (measured in seconds) and prolonged loss of consciousness (measured in minutes) respectively.<ref name="Heads up"/> According to the AAN, permanent brain injury can occur with either Grade&nbsp;II or Grade&nbsp;III concussion.

By these guidelines, an athlete suffering a single, grade&nbsp;I concussion is given a neurological evaluation every five&nbsp;minutes starting immediately after the injury and may return to the competition if signs and symptoms resolve within a quarter of an hour.<ref name=aanMgmt/>  Otherwise, the return to play rules are the same for the AAN and Colorado Medical Society guidelines.<ref name="Heads up"/><ref name="Cuccurullo"/><ref name=aanMgmt>

==Impact on training of coaches==
It is now being recommended by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and state athletic organizations that coaches be trained in managing athlete concussions according to current guidelines.<ref>[http://www.wiaa.com/ardisplay.aspx?ID=454 Washington Interscholactic Activities Association Concussion Management Guidelines]</ref><ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-01-31/sports/os-concussion-forum-0201-20100131_1_sports-related-concussions-football-coach-bob-head-athletes/2 Legislation]</ref>
