The disorder can result in death if undiagnosed or left untreated.

==Causes==

===Genetic===
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|left|Methylmalonic acidemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

[[File:Odd-chain FA oxydation.png|thumb|right|Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by a defect in the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase.]]

The inherited forms of methylmalonic acidemia cause defects in the metabolic pathway where [[methylmalonyl-coenzyme A]] (CoA) is converted into [[succinyl-CoA]] by the enzyme [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sakomoto O, Ohura T, Matsubara Y, Takayanagi M, Tsuchiya S |title=Mutation and haplotype analyses of the MUT gene in Japanese patients with methylmalonic acidemia |journal=J Hum Genet. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=48–55 |year=2007 |pmid=17075691 |doi=10.1007/s10038-006-0077-2 }}</ref>

[[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] is also needed for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to Succinyl-CoA.  Mutations leading to defects in vitamin B<sub>12</sub> metabolism or in its transport frequently result in the development of methylmalonic acidemia.

This disorder has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene—one from each parent—must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.

===Nutritional===
A severe nutritional deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can also result in methylmalonic acidemia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197808172990701 |author=Higginbottom MC, Sweetman L, Nyhan WL |title=A syndrome of methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, megaloblastic anemia and neurological abnormalities in a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-deficient breast-fed infant of a strict vegetarian |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=299 |issue=7 |pages=317–323 |year=1978 |pmid=683264 }}</ref> Methylmalonyl CoA requires vitamin B<sub>12</sub> to form succinyl-CoA. When the amount of B<sub>12</sub> is insufficient for the conversion of cofactor methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, the buildup of unused methylmalonyl-CoA eventually leads to methylmalonic acidemia. This diagnosis is often used as an indicator of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in [[blood test|serum]].<ref>[http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/b12/04t.html http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/b12/04t.html]<br>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency - The methylmalonic aciduria connection</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
Methylmalonic acidemia has varying diagnoses, treatment requirements and prognoses, which are determined by the specific genetic mutation causing the inherited form of the disorder.<ref name=geno/> The following are the known genotypes responsible for methylmalonic acidemia:
