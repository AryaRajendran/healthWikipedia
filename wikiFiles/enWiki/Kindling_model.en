'''Kindling''' is a commonly used [[scientific modelling|model]] for the development of [[seizure]]s and [[epilepsy]] in which the duration and behavioral involvement of induced seizures increases after seizures are induced repeatedly.<ref name="Bertram07">

The brains of [[Animal experimentation|experimental animals]] are repeatedly stimulated, usually with electricity, to induce the seizures.<ref name="Bertram07"/>  Chemicals may also be used to induce seizures.<ref name="Abel92"/>  The seizure that occurs after the first such electrical stimulation lasts a short time and is accompanied by a small amount of behavioral effects compared with seizures that result from repeated stimulations.<ref name="Bertram07"/> With further seizures, the accompanying behavior intensifies, for example progressing from freezing in early stimulations to convulsions in later ones.<ref name="Morimoto04">

</ref> The lengthening of duration and intensification of behavioral accompaniment eventually reaches a plateau after repeated stimulation.<ref name="Bertram07"/>  Even if animals are left unstimulated for as long as 12&nbsp;weeks, the effect remains; the response to stimulation remains higher than it had been before.<ref name="Abel92"/>

It has been reported that repeated seizure stimulation can result in spontaneous seizures, but studies have had conflicting findings on this question.<ref name="Bertram07"/>  In humans, some seizure disorders come to an end by themselves even after large numbers of seizures.<ref name="Bertram07"/>  However, in both human epilepsy and in some animal models, evidence suggests that a process like that found in kindling does occur.<ref name="Bertram07"/>
