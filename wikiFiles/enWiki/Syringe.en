[[Image:Syringe2.jpg|thumb|235px|A typical medical syringe with needle]]

A '''syringe''' is a simple [[pump]] consisting of a plunger that fits tightly in a tube. The plunger can be pulled and pushed along inside a cylindrical tube (called a barrel), allowing the syringe to take in and expel a [[liquid]] or [[gas]] through an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] at the open end of the tube. The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a [[hypodermic needle]], a [[nozzle]], or [[Tubing (material)|tubing]] to help direct the flow into and out of the barrel. Syringes are often used to administer [[injection (medicine)|injections]], insert intravenous drugs into the bloodstream, apply compounds such as [[glue]] or [[lubricant]], and measure liquids.

The word "syringe" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] συριγξ [[syrinx]] = "tube" via [[back-formation]] of a new singular from its Greek-type plural "syringes" (συριγγες ''syringes'').

:''See also [[Hypodermic needle]].''
[[Image:Syringe.jpg|thumb|200px|The threads of the [[Luer Taper|Luer lock]] tip of this 12ml disposable syringe keep it securely connected to a tube or other apparatus.]]

Hypodermic syringes are used with [[hypodermic needle]]s to [[Injection (medicine)|inject]] [[liquid]] or gases into body tissues, or to remove from the [[body]]. Injecting of [[air]] into a [[blood vessel]] is hazardous, as it may cause an [[air embolism]]; preventing embolisms by removing [[air]] from the syringe is one of the reasons for the familiar image of holding a hypodermic syringe upside down, tapping it, and expelling a small amount of liquid before an injection into the [[bloodstream]].

The [[barrel]] of a syringe is made of [[plastic]] or [[glass]], and usually has graduated marks indicating the volume of [[fluid]] in the syringe, and is nearly always transparent. [[Glass]] syringes may be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] in an [[autoclave]]. However, most modern medical syringes are [[plastic]] with a rubber piston, because this type seals much better between the piston and the barrel and because they are cheap enough to dispose of after being used only once, reducing the [[risk]] of spreading [[blood-borne disease]]s. Re-use of needles and syringes has caused spread of diseases, especially [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis]] among intravenous drug users. Syringes are, however, commonly re-used by diabetics and this is safe, if the syringe is only used by one person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pediatriconcall.com/Forpatients/commonchild/Endocrine_problems/insulin.htm |title=Pediatric Oncall-Insulin Delivery-Injection |publisher=Pediatriconcall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

Medical syringes are sometimes used without a needle for orally administering liquid medicines to young children or animals, or milk to small young animals, because the dose can be measured accurately, and it is easier to squirt the medicine into the subject's mouth instead of coaxing the subject to drink out of a measuring spoon.

===Tip designs===
Syringes come with a number of designs for the area in which the blade locks to the syringe body. Perhaps the most well known of these is the [[Luer lock]], which simply twists the two together.

Bodies featuring a small, plain connection are known as slip tips and are useful for when the syringe is being connected to something not featuring a screw lock mechanism.

Similar to this is the catheter tip, which is essentially a slip tip but longer and tapered, making it good for pushing into things where there the plastic taper can form a tight seal. These can also be used for rinsing out wounds or large abscesses in veterinary use.

There is also an eccentric tip, where the nozzle at the end of the syringe is not in the centre of the syringe but at the side. This causes the blade attached to the syringe to lie almost in line with the walls of the syringe itself and they are used when the blade needs to get very close to parallel with the skin (when injecting into a surface vein or artery for example).

===Standard U-100 insulin syringes===<!-- This section is linked from [[Insulin pump]] -->
[[Image:Standard insulin syringe.JPG|thumb|200px|Insulin syringes are marked in insulin "units".]]
Syringes for [[insulin]] users are designed for standard U-100 insulin.  The dilution of insulin is such that 1 ml of insulin fluid has 100 standard "units" of insulin.<ref>{{cite journal|author=USA |pmid=12060790 |title=Making the unit of insulin PubMed |publisher=|date=2010-12-08 |volume=76 |issue=2 |journal=Bull Hist Med |pages=231–70}}</ref>  Since insulin vials are typically 10 ml, each vial has 1000 units.

Insulin syringes are made specifically for self injections and have friendly features:

===Multishot needle syringes===
There are needle syringes designed to reload from a built-in tank (container) after each injection, so they can make several or many injections on a filling. These are not used much in human medicine because of the risk of cross-infection via the needle. An exception is the personal [[insulin]] [[autoinjector]] used by [[diabetes|diabetic]] patients.

===Venom extraction syringes===
Venom extraction syringes are different from standard syringes, because they usually don't puncture the wound. The most common types have a plastic nozzle which is placed over the affected area, and then the syringe piston is pulled back, creating a vacuum that allegedly sucks out the venom. Attempts to treat snakebites in this way are specifically advised against, as they are ineffective and can cause additional injury.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

===Oral===
An oral syringe is a [[measuring instrument]] used to accurately measure doses of liquid [[medicine]] which are expressed in [[Millilitre#SI_prefixes_applied_to_the_litre|millilitres]] (mL).

Oral syringes are available in various sizes, from 1-10 mL and larger. The sizes most commonly used are 1 mL, 2.5 mL and 5 mL.<ref>[http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice/facts/oralsyringe.htm How to use your oral syringe | NetDoctor]</ref>

===Dental syringes===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
A dental syringe is a used by [[dentist]]s for the injection of an [[Dental anesthesia|anesthetic]]. It consists of a breech-loading syringe fitted with a sealed cartridge containing anesthetic solution.

The ancillary tool (generally part of a [[dental engine]]) used to supply water, compressed air or mist (formed by combination of water and compressed air) to the oral cavity for the purpose of irrigation (cleaning debris away from the area the dentist is working on), is also referred to as a dental syringe or a dental irrigation nozzle. 
A 3-way syringe / nozzle has separate internal channels supplying air, water or a mist created by combining the pressurized air with the waterflow. The syringe tip can be separated from the main body and replaced when necessary.

===Governmental control of syringes===
In some jurisdictions, the sale or possession of hypodermic syringes may be controlled or prohibited without a prescription,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/d_09_700.htm |title=Children With Diabetes-Prescription Needed or Not? |publisher=Childrenwithdiabetes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> due to its potential use with illegal [[intravenous drug]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/lawschool/phrhcs/de-criminal_laws.htm|title=Criminal Law and Syringe Disposal in Delaware|accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>

==Non-medical uses==
The syringe has many non-medical applications.

===Laboratory applications===
[[Image:Laboratory grease 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Laboratory grease, commonly used to lubricate [[ground glass joint]]s and [[stopcock]]s, is sometimes loaded in syringes for easy application]]
Medical-grade disposable hypodermic syringes are often used in research laboratories for convenience and low cost. Another application is to use the needle tip to add liquids to very confined spaces, such as washing out some scientific apparatus. They are often used for measuring and transferring solvents and reagents where a high precision is not required.  Alternatively, microliter syringes can be used to measure and dose chemicals very precisely by using a small diameter capillary as the syringe barrel.

The [[polyethylene]] construction of these disposable syringes usually makes them rather chemically resistant. There is, however, a risk of the contents of the syringes leaching plasticizers from the syringe material. Non-disposable glass syringes may be preferred where this is a problem. Glass syringes may also be preferred where a very high degree of precision is important (i.e. [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative chemical analysis]]), because their [[tolerance (engineering)|engineering tolerances]] are lower and the plungers move more smoothly. In these applications, the transfer of [[pathogens]] is usually not an issue.

Used with a long needle or [[cannula]], syringes are also useful for transferring fluids through rubber [[septum|septa]] when atmospheric [[oxygen]] or [[moisture]] are being excluded. Examples include the transfer of air-sensitive or [[pyrophoric]] reagents such as [[phenylmagnesium bromide]] and [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] respectively. Glass syringes are also used to inject small samples for [[gas chromatography]] (1 μl) and [[mass spectrometry]] (10 μl). Syringe drivers may be used with the syringe as well.

[[Image:Aa syringe graduations.jpg|right|thumb|200px|25ml re-usable glass hypodermic syringe, and inch cube for scale.]]

===Cooking===
Some [[culinary]] uses of syringes are injecting liquids (such as [[gravy]]) into other foods, or for the manufacture of [[candy|candies]], such as [[Fruit Gushers]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Syringes may also be used when [[cooking]] meat to enhance flavor and texture by injecting juices inside the meat, and in [[baking]] to inject filling inside a [[pastry]].

===Others===
Syringes are used to refill [[ink cartridge]]s with [[ink]].

Common workshop applications include injecting [[glue]] into tight spots to repair joints where disassembly is impractical or impossible; and injecting lubricants onto working surfaces without spilling. 

Sometimes a large hypodermic syringe is used without a needle for very small baby [[mammal]]s to [[breastfeeding|suckle]] from in artificial rearing.

Historically, large pumps that use reciprocating motion to pump water were referred to as syringes.  Pumps of this type were used as early [[firefighting]] equipment.

There are fountain syringes where the liquid is in a bag or can and goes to the nozzle via a pipe. In earlier times, [[clyster]] syringes were used for that purpose.

Loose [[snus]] is often applied using modified syringes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The nozzle is removed so the opening is the width of the chamber. The snus can be packed tightly into the chamber and plunged into the upper lip. Syringes, called portioners, are also manufactured for this particular purpose.

==Historical timeline==
The oldest known use of the syringe tool is in India. Many paintings and various other forms of illustrations depict the use of syringes during the [[Hindu]] holiday of [[Holi]]. The syringe was used as a squirting apparatus. 
*The first piston syringes were used in Roman times. during the 1st century AD [[Celsus]] mentions the use of them to treat medical complications in his [[De Medicina]].
*9th century AD: The [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]]/[[Egyptians|Egyptian]] surgeon [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|Ammar ibn 'Ali al-Mawsili']] created a syringe in the 9th century using a hollow glass tube, and suction to remove [[cataracts]] from patients' eyes, a practice that remained in use up until at least the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
*c. 1650: [[Blaise Pascal]] invented a syringe (not necessarily hypodermic) as an application of what is now called [[Pascal's law]].
*1844: Irish physician Francis Rynd invented the hollow needle and used it to make the first recorded subcutaneous injections, specifically a sedative to treat neuralgia.
*1853: [[Charles Pravaz]] and [[Alexander Wood (physician)|Alexander Wood]] developed a medical hypodermic syringe with a needle fine enough to pierce the skin. Shortly thereafter, the first recorded fatality from a hypodermic-syringe induced overdose was Wood's wife from self-administered morphine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/hypodermicsyringe.aspx | title = Hypodermic syringe | accessdate = 21 June 2012}}</ref>
*1946: [[Chance Brothers]] in [[Smethwick]], [[Birmingham]], England produce the first all-glass syringe with interchangeable barrel and plunger, thereby allowing mass-sterilisation of components without the need for matching them.
*1956: New Zealand pharmacist and inventor [[Colin Murdoch]] granted New Zealand and Australian patents for a disposable plastic syringe.
