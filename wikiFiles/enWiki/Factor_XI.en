'''Factor XI''' or '''plasma thromboplastin antecedent''' is the [[zymogen]] form of factor XIa, one of the [[enzyme]]s of the [[coagulation|coagulation cascade]]. Like many other coagulation factors, it is a [[serine protease]].  In humans, Factor XI is encoded by the ''F11'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid3636155">{{cite journal | author = Fujikawa K, Chung DW, Hendrickson LE, Davie EW | title = Amino acid sequence of human factor XI, a blood coagulation factor with four tandem repeats that are highly homologous with plasma prekallikrein | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 2417–24 | year = 1986 | month = May | pmid = 3636155 | doi = 10.1021/bi00357a018| url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid2827746">{{cite journal | author = Asakai R, Davie EW, Chung DW | title = Organization of the gene for human factor XI | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 26 | issue = 23 | pages = 7221–8 | year = 1987 | month = November | pmid = 2827746 | doi = 10.1021/bi00397a004| url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid2612218">{{cite journal | author = Kato A, Asakai R, Davie EW, Aoki N | title = Factor XI gene (F11) is located on the distal end of the long arm of human chromosome 4 | journal = Cytogenet.

==Physiology==
Factor XI (FXI) is produced by the [[liver]] and circulates as a [[protein dimer|homo-dimer]] in its inactive form.<ref name="pmid18441012">{{cite journal | author = Wu W, Sinha D, Shikov S, Yip CK, Walz T, Billings PC, Lear JD, Walsh PN | title = Factor XI Homodimer Structure Is Essential for Normal Proteolytic Activation by Factor XIIa, Thrombin, and Factor XIa | journal = J.

The zymogen factor is activated into ''factor XIa'' by [[factor XII]]a (FXIIa), [[thrombin]], and it is also [[autocatalytic]], and FXI is a member of the "contact pathway" due to activation by FXIIa (with includes [[high molecular weight kininogen|HMWK]], [[prekallikrein]], [[factor XII]], factor XI and [[factor IX]]).<ref name="pmid11487044">{{cite journal | author = Walsh PN | title = Roles of platelets and factor XI in the initiation of blood coagulation by thrombin | journal = Thromb.

Factor XIa activates factor IX by selectively cleaving [[arginine|arg]]-[[alanine|ala]] and [[arginine|arg]]-[[valine|val]] [[peptide bond]]s. Factor IXa, in turn, activates [[factor X]].

Inhibitors of factor XIa include [[protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor]] (ZPI, a member of the [[serine protease inhibitor]]/serpin class of proteins), which is independent of [[protein Z]] (its action on factor X, however, is protein Z-dependent, hence its name).

==Protein structure and molecular biology==
Although synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, FXI circulates as a homodimer. Every chain has a relative molecular mass of approximately 80000. Typical plasma concentrations of FXI are 5 μg/mL, corresponding to a plasma concentration (of FXI dimers) of approximately 30 nM.
The FXI gene is 23kb in length, has 15 exons, and is found on chromosome 4q32-35.<ref name="pmid2827746"/><ref name="pmid2612218"/>

==Role in disease==
Deficiency of factor XI causes the rare [[hemophilia C]]; this mainly occurs in [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jew]]s and is believed to affect approximately 8% of that population, of both sexes. Less commonly, hemophilia C can be found in Jews of Iraqi ancestry and in Israeli Arabs. The condition has been described in other populations at around 1% of cases. It is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder. There is little spontaneous bleeding, but surgical procedures may cause excessive blood loss, and prophylaxis is required.<ref name="pmid8800510">{{cite journal | author = Bolton-Maggs PH | title = Factor XI deficiency | journal = Baillieres Clin. Haematol. | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 355–68 | year = 1996 | month = June | pmid = 8800510 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(96)80068-0| url =  }}</ref>

Low levels of factor XI also occur in many other disease states, including [[Noonan syndrome]].

High levels of factor XI have been implicated in [[thrombosis]], although it is uncertain what determines these levels and how serious the procoagulant state is.
