The '''Kozak consensus sequence''', '''Kozak consensus''' or '''Kozak sequence''', is a sequence which occurs on [[eukaryotic]] [[mRNA]] and has the [[consensus sequence|consensus]] <tt>(gcc)gccRccAUGG</tt>.

==Introduction==
This sequence on an mRNA [[molecule]] is recognized by the [[ribosome]] as the translational start site, from which a [[protein]] is coded by that mRNA molecule. The ribosome requires this sequence, or a possible variation (see below) to initiate [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. The Kozak sequence is not to be confused with the [[ribosomal binding site]] (RBS), that being either the [[5' cap]] of a [[messenger RNA]] or an [[Internal ribosome entry site]] (IRES).

''In vivo'', this site is often not matched exactly on different mRNAs and the amount of protein synthesized from a given mRNA is dependent on the strength of the Kozak sequence.<ref name="Kozak1984">{{cite journal |author=Kozak M |title=Point mutations close to the AUG initiator codon affect the efficiency of translation of rat preproinsulin in vivo |journal=Nature |volume=308 |pages=241–246 |year=1984 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v308/n5956/abs/308241a0.html |pmid=6700727 |doi=10.1038/308241a0 |issue=5956}}</ref> Some nucleotides in this sequence are more important than others: the '''AUG''' is most important because it is the actual initiation codon encoding a methionine amino acid at the N-terminus of the protein.  (Rarely, '''CUG''' is used as an initiation codon, encoding a leucine instead of its typical methionine.)  The '''A''' nucleotide of the "AUG" is referred to as number 1. For a 'strong' consensus, the nucleotides at positions +4 (i.e. G in the consensus) and -3 (i.e. either A or G in the consensus) relative to the number 1 nucleotide must both match the consensus (there is no number 0 position). An 'adequate' consensus has only 1 of these sites, while a 'weak' consensus has neither. The cc at -1 and -2 are not as conserved, but contribute to the overall strength.<ref name="Kozak1986">{{cite journal |author=Kozak M |title=Point mutations define a sequence flanking the AUG initiator codon that modulates translation by eukaryotic ribosomes |journal=Cell |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=283–92 |year=1986 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v308/n5956/abs/308241a0.html |pmid=3943125 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(86)90762-2}}</ref> There is also evidence that a G in the -6 position is important in the initiation of translation.<ref name="Angioletti2004"/>

There are examples in vivo of each of these types of Kozak consensus, and they probably evolved as yet another mechanism of gene regulation. [http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=LMX1B Lmx1b] is an example of a gene with a weak Kozak consensus sequence.<ref name="Dunston2004">{{cite journal |author=Dunston JA, Hamlington JD, Zaveri J, ''et al.'' |title=The human LMX1B gene: transcription unit, promoter, and pathogenic mutations |journal=Genomics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=565–76 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15498463 |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2004.06.002 |url=}}</ref> For initiation of translation from such a site, other features are required in the mRNA sequence in order for the ribosome to recognize the initiation codon.

==Mutations==
Research has shown that a mutation of G&mdash;>C in the -6 position of the β-globin gene (β+45; human) disrupted the haematological and biosynthetic phenotype function. This was the first mutation found in the Kozak sequence. It was found in a family from the Southeast Italy and they suffered from [[thalassaemia intermedia]].<ref name="Angioletti2004"/>
