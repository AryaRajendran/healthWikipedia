'''Interleukin 8''' ('''IL-8''') is a [[chemokine]] produced by [[macrophages]] and other cell types such as [[epithelial cells]]. It is also synthesized by [[endothelial cells]], which store IL-8 in their storage vesicles, the [[Weibel-Palade bodies]].<ref name="pmid9802987">{{cite journal | author = Wolff B, Burns AR, Middleton J, Rot A | title = Endothelial cell "memory" of inflammatory stimulation: human venular endothelial cells store interleukin 8 in Weibel-Palade bodies | journal = J.

There are many receptors of the surface membrane capable to bind IL-8; the most frequently studied types are the [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] serpentine receptors [[interleukin 8 receptor, alpha|CXCR1]], and [[interleukin 8 receptor, beta|CXCR2]]. Expression and affinity to IL-8 is different in the two receptors (CXCR1 > CXCR2). [[Toll-like receptor]]s are the receptors of the innate immune system.  These receptors recognize antigen patterns (like LPS in gram negative bacteria).  Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.

== Function ==
IL-8, also known as ''neutrophil chemotactic factor'', has two primary functions.  It induces [[chemotaxis]] in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also induces phagocytosis once they have arrived.  IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of [[angiogenesis]]. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exocytosis (e.g. [[histamine]] release), and [[respiratory burst]].

IL-8 can be secreted by any cells with [[toll-like receptor]]s that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the [[macrophages]] that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and [[homodimer]] forms of IL-8 have been reported to be potent inducers of the chemokines CXCR1 and CXCR2.  The homodimer is more potent, but [[methylation]] of Leu25 can block activity of the dimers.

IL-8 is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of [[bronchiolitis]], a common respiratory tract disease caused by viral infection.{fact}

IL-8 is a member of the CXC chemokine family. The genes encoding this and the other ten members of the CXC chemokine family form a cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 4q.<ref name="pmid1967588"/><ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: IL8 interleukin 8| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3576| accessdate = }}</ref>

== Target cells ==

While neutrophil granulocytes are the primary target cells of IL-8, there is a relative wide range of cells ([[endothelial cells]], [[macrophage]]s, [[mast cell]]s, and [[keratinocyte]]s) responding to this chemokine, too. The chemoattractant activity of IL-8 in similar concentrations to vertebrates was proven in [[Tetrahymena]] pyriformis, which refers to a phylogenetically well-conserved structure and function in the case of this chemokine.<ref name="pmid9702410">{{cite journal | author = Köhidai L, Csaba G | title = Chemotaxis and chemotactic selection induced with cytokines (IL-8, RANTES and TNF-alpha) in the unicellular Tetrahymena pyriformis | journal = Cytokine | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 481–6 | year = 1998 | month = July | pmid = 9702410 | doi = 10.1006/cyto.1997.0328 | url =  }}</ref>

== Clinical significance ==

Interleukin-8 is often associated with inflammation. As an example, it has been cited as a proinflammatory mediator in [[gingivitis]]<ref>Haake, SK, Huang, GTJ: Molecular Biology of the host-Microbe Interaction in Periodontal Diseases (Selected Topics). In Newman, Takei, Carranza, editors: ''Clinical Periodontology'', 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B.Saunders Co. 2002. page 162.</ref> and [[psoriasis]].[http://www.ucsf.edu/dpsl/psoriasis.html]. The fact that Interleukin-8 secretion is increased by oxidant stress, which thereby causes the recruitment of inflammatory cells induces a further increase in oxidant stress mediators, making it a key parameter in localized inflammation.<ref name="pmid10477716">{{cite journal | author = Vlahopoulos S, Boldogh I, Casola A, Brasier AR | title = Nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent induction of interleukin-8 gene expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha: evidence for an antioxidant sensitive activating pathway distinct from nuclear translocation | journal = Blood | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 1878–89 | year = 1999 | month = September | pmid = 10477716 | doi = | url =  }}</ref>

If a pregnant mother has high levels of interleukin-8, there is an increased risk of [[schizophrenia]] in her offspring.<ref name="pmid15121655">{{cite journal | author = Brown AS, Hooton J, Schaefer CA, Zhang H, Petkova E, Babulas V, Perrin M, Gorman JM, Susser ES | title = Elevated maternal interleukin-8 levels and risk of schizophrenia in adult offspring | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 889–95 | year = 2004 | month = May | pmid = 15121655 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.161.5.889 | url =  }}</ref> High levels of Interleukin 8 have been shown to reduce the likelihood of positive responses to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia.<ref name="pmid15291683">{{cite journal | author = Zhang XY, Zhou DF, Cao LY, Zhang PY, Wu GY, Shen YC | title = Changes in serum interleukin-2, -6, and -8 levels before and during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol: relationship to outcome in schizophrenia | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 7 | pages = 940–7 | year = 2004 | month = July | pmid = 15291683 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v65n0710| url = http://www.jclinpsychiatry.com/abstracts/abstracts.asp?abstract=200407/070407.htm }}</ref>
