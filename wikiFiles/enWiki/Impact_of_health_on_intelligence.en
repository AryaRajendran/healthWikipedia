{{Human intelligence}}

'''[[Health]] can affect [[intelligence]]''' in various ways. Conversely, [[Cognitive_epidemiology|intelligence can affect health]]. Health effects on intelligence have been described as being among the most important factors in the origins of human group differences in [[IQ test]] scores and other measures of [[cognitive ability]].<ref name=Deary2008>I. J. Deary. (2008). Why do intelligent people live longer? ''Nature'', '''456''', 175-6. 10.1038/456175a</ref> Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the [[blood–brain barrier]] is less effective. Such impairment may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth.

Developed nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function. These include laws requiring [[food fortification|fortification]] of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[organochloride]]s). Comprehensive policy recommendations targeting reduction of cognitive impairment in children have been proposed.<ref name="Olness">{{cite journal |author=Olness K |title=Effects on brain development leading to cognitive impairment: a worldwide epidemic |journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=120–30 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12692458 |doi=10.1097/00004703-200304000-00009}}</ref><ref name="Perlmutter">{{cite book |last=Perlmutter |first=David  |authorlink=David Perlmutter (neurologist) |coauthors=Carol Colman |title=Raise a Smarter Child By Kindergarten: Raise Iq Points By Up to 30 Points and Turn on Your Child's Smart Genes Points |year=2006 |publisher=Morgan Road Books |isbn=978-0-7679-2301-9 }}</ref>

Improvements in [[nutrition]], and in public policy in general, have been implicated in worldwide IQ increases (the [[Flynn effect]]) {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

== Nutrition ==
Malnutrition may occur during several periods of growth, such as [[pregnancy]], during [[breastfeeding]], [[infancy]], or childhood. It may also happen due to deficiencies of different nutrients, such as [[micronutrients]], [[protein]] or energy. This may cause different effects.

=== Timing ===
Some observers have argued that [[malnutrition]] during the first six months of life harms cognitive development much more than malnutrition later in life. However, a study from the [[Philippines]] argues that malnutrition in the second year of life may have a larger negative impact than malnutrition in the first year of life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Glewwe P, King EM |title=The Impact of Early Childhood Nutritional Status on Cognitive Development: Does the Timing of Malnutrition Matter? |journal=World Bank Economic Review |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–113 |year= 2001|doi=10.1093/wber/15.1.81 |url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/1/81}}</ref>

=== Intrauterine growth retardation ===

Undernutrition during pregnancy, and other factors, may cause [[intrauterine growth retardation]] (IUGR), which is one cause of [[low birth weight]]. However, it has been suggested that in IUGR the [[brain]] may be selectively spared. Brain growth is usually less affected than whole body weight or length. Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine growth retardation also affecting brain growth, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in [[adolescence]] or adulthood. For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the [[Dutch famine of 1944]] caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas. This was later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18–19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas. The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the [[famine]], births decreased more among those with lower [[Socioeconomic status]] (SES), whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES. Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Causes and consequences of intrauterine growth retardation.

=== Breastfeeding ===
Studies often find higher IQ in children and adults who were breastfed.<ref name="Perlmutter"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Masters R |chapter=Brain [[biochemistry]] and social status: The [[neurotoxicity]] hypothesis |editor=White, Elliott |title=Intelligence, political inequality, and public policy |publisher=Prager |location=New York, N.Y |year=1997 |pages=141–183 |isbn=0-275-95655-5 }}
</ref> It has also been proposed that the omega-3 fatty acids that are found in high doses in breast milk, and that are known to be essential constituents of brain tissues, could at least partially account for an increase in IQ.

Recently, however, the longstanding belief that [[breastfeeding]] causes an increase in the [[IQ]] of offspring was challenged in a 2006 paper published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''. The results indicated that mother's IQ, not breastfeeding, explained the differences in the IQ scores of offspring measured between ages 5 and 14. The results of this study argued that prior studies had not controlled for the mother's IQ. Since mother's IQ was predictive of whether a child was breastfed, the study concluded that "breast feeding [itself] has little or no effect on intelligence in children." Instead, it was the mother's IQ that had a significant correlation with the IQ of her offspring, whether the offspring was breastfed or was not breastfed.<ref>

A potential resolution to these different interpretations was proposed in a study showing that breastfeeding was linked to raised IQ (as much as 7 points when not controlling for maternal IQ) if the infants had an [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] coding for a "C" rather than G base within the [[FADS2]] gene. Those with the "G" version showed no IQ advantage, suggesting a biochemical interaction of child's genes on the effect of breast feeding.<ref>[http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2007/11/breastIQ.html Baby's IQ Raised by Breastmilk and Genes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="pmid17984066">{{cite journal |author=Caspi A |title=Moderation of breastfeeding effects on the IQ by genetic variation in fatty acid metabolism |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume= 104|issue= 47|pages= 18860–5|year=2007 |pmid=17984066 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0704292104 |pmc=2141867 |author-separator=, |author2=Williams B |author3=Kim-Cohen J |display-authors=3 |last4=Craig |first4=I.

=== Infancy ===
Two studies in [[Chile]] on 18-year-old high-school graduates found that nutritional status during the first year of life affected IQ, scholastic achievement, and brain volume.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ivanovic DM |title=Nutritional status, brain development and scholastic achievement of Chilean high-school graduates from high and low intellectual quotient and socio-economic status |journal=Br.

=== Micronutrients and vitamin deficiencies ===
[[Micronutrient]] deficiencies (e.g. in [[iodine]] and [[iron (element)|iron]]) influence the development of intelligence and remain a problem in the developing world. For example, [[iodine deficiency]] causes a fall, in average, of 12 IQ points.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Qian M |title=The effects of iodine on intelligence in children: a meta-analysis of studies conducted in China |journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=32–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15734706|author-separator=,|author2=Wang D|author3=Watkins WE|display-authors=3|last4=Gebski|first4=V|last5=Yan|first5=YQ|last6=Li|first6=M|last7=Chen|first7=ZP}}</ref>

Policy recommendations to increase availability of micronutrient supplements have been made and justified in part by the potential to counteract intelligence-related developmental problems. For example, the [[Copenhagen consensus]], states that lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development, and this can affect enormous numbers of people: it is estimated that 2 billion people (one-third of the total global population) are affected by iodine deficiency, including 285 million 6- to 12-year-old children. In developing countries, it is estimated that 40% of children aged four and under suffer from [[anaemia]] because of insufficient iron in their diets.<ref>Behrman, J.R., Alderman, H., and Hoddinott, J., "[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Files/Filer/CC/Papers/sammendrag/Accepted__Hunger_summary_070504.pdf Hunger and Malnutrition]," Copenhagen Consensus 2004.</ref>

A joint statement on [[vitamin]] and mineral deficiencies says that the severity of such deficiencies "means the impairment of hundreds of millions of growing minds and the lowering of national IQs."<ref>UNICEF and The [[Micronutrient Initiative]], "[http://www.micronutrient.org/reports/reports/Full_e.html Vitamin & Mineral Deficiency: A Global Progress Report]," March 2004.</ref>

Overall, studies investigating whether cognitive function in already iron-deficient children can be improved with iron supplements have produced mixed results, possibly because deficiency in critical growth periods may cause irreversible damage. However, several studies with better design have shown substantial benefits. One way to prevent iron deficiency is to give specific supplementation to children, for example as tablets. However, this is costly, distribution mechanisms are often ineffective, and [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] is low. Fortification of staple foods (cereals, [[flour]], [[sugar]], [[salt]]) to deliver micronutrients to children on a large scale is probably the most sustainable and affordable option, even though commitment from governments and the food industry is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saloojee H, Pettifor JM |title=Iron deficiency and impaired child development |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7326 |pages=1377–8 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11744547 |pmc=1121846 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7326.1377 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/323/7326/1377}}</ref> Developed nations fortify several foods with various micronutrients.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2840E/w2840e03.htm FOOD FORTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY] Food Fortification: [[Technology]] and [[Quality control|Quality Control]]. (FAO Food And Nutrition Paper - 60)</ref>

Additional vitamin-mineral supplementation may have an effect also in the developed world. A study giving such supplementation to "working class," primarily [[Hispanic]], 6–12-year-old children in the [[United States]] for 3 months found an average increase of 2 to 3 IQ points. Most of this can be explained by the very large increase of a subgroup of the children, presumably because these were not adequately nourished unlike the majority. The study suggests that parents of schoolchildren whose academic performance is substandard would be well advised to seek a nutritionally oriented [[physician]] for assessment of their children's nutritional status as a possible [[etiology]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schoenthaler SJ, Bier ID, Young K, Nichols D, Jansenns S |title=The effect of vitamin-mineral supplementation on the intelligence of American schoolchildren: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=19–29 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10706232 |doi=10.1089/acm.2000.6.19}}</ref>

More speculatively, other nutrients may prove important in the future. Fish oil supplement to [[pregnant]] and lactating mothers has been linked to increased cognitive ability in one study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helland IB, Smith L, Saarem K, Saugstad OD, Drevon CA |title=Maternal supplementation with very-long-chain n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation augments children's IQ at 4 years of age |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=e39–44 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12509593 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.1.e39}}</ref> [[Vitamin B12]] and [[folate]] may be important for cognitive function in old age.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Duthie SJ, Whalley LJ, Collins AR, Leaper S, Berger K, Deary IJ |title=Homocysteine, B vitamin status, and cognitive function in the elderly |journal=Am.

Another study found that pregnant women who consumed 340&nbsp;grams of low-mercury containing [[fish]] with fatty acids per week have benefits that outweigh the risks for [[mercury poisoning]]. They were less likely to have children with low verbal [[IQ]], [[motor coordination]] and behavioral problems. However, foods containing high amounts of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], such as [[shark]], [[swordfish]], [[king mackerel]] and [[tilefish]], might cause [[mental retardation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lyketsos CG |title=Should pregnant women avoid eating fish?

=== Protein and energy malnutrition ===

One study from a developing country, [[Guatemala]], found that poor growth during infancy, rather than low birth weight, was negatively related to adolescent performance on cognitive and achievement tests.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pollitt E, Gorman KS, Engle PL, Martorell R, Rivera J |title=Early supplementary feeding and cognition: effects over two decades |journal=Monogr Soc Res Child Dev |volume=58 |issue=7 |pages=1–99; discussion 111–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8272081 |doi=10.2307/1166162 |jstor=1166162 |publisher=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, Vol. 58, No. 7}}</ref> A later related very long term study looked at the effect of giving 6–24-month-old children in Guatemala a high protein-energy drink as a dietary supplement.

== Toxins ==
=== Industrial chemicals ===
Certain toxins, such as [[lead (element)|lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[toluene]], and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] are well-known causes of neuro-developmental disorders. Recognition of these risks has led to evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in [[petrol]]. Although these prevention campaigns are highly successful, most were initiated only after substantial delays.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grandjean P, [[Philip J.

A Lancet review identified 201 chemicals with the ability to cause clinical neurotoxic effects in human adults, as described in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Most of them are commonly used. Many additional chemicals have been shown to be neurotoxic in laboratory models.

Current [[cannabis]] use was found to be significantly correlated in a dose-dependent manner with a decline in IQ scores, during the effect of the use. However, no such decline was seen in subjects who had formerly been heavy cannabis users and had stopped taking the drug. The authors concluded that cannabis does not have a long-term effect on intelligence. However this is contradicted by the long term longitudinal study, carried out by Otago and Duke universities,which found that regular use of marijuana in teenage years affects  IQ in adulthood  even when the use stops. The drop in IQ was 8 points. Adults smoking marijuana had no lasting effect on IQ.<ref>Nature Journal.

== Healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth ==
Healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth, access to which is often governed by policy, also influences cognitive development.  Preventable causes of low intelligence in children include infectious diseases such as [[meningitis]], parasites, and cerebral malaria, prenatal drug and alcohol exposure, newborn [[asphyxia]], low birth weight, head injuries, and endocrine disorders. A direct policy focus on determinants of childhood cognitive ability has been urged.<ref name="Olness"/>

== Infectious diseases ==

A 2010 study by Eppig, Fincher and Thornhill found a close correlation between the infectious disease burden in a country and the average IQ of its population. The researchers found that when disease was controlled for, IQ showed no correlation with other variables such as educational and nutritional levels. Since brain development requires a very high proportion of all the body's energy in newborns and children, the researchers argue that fighting infection reduces children's IQ potential. The Eppig research may help to explain the [[Flynn effect]], the rise in intelligence noted in rich countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=MacKenzie|first=Debora|title=Link found between infectious disease and IQ|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727670.301-link-found-between-infectious-disease-and-iq.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=health|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> They also tested other hypotheses as well, including genetic explanations, concluding that infectious disease was "the best predictor".<ref name = "Eppig 2011">{{cite journal |journal= Scientific American |year=2011 |title= Why Is Average IQ Higher in Some Places? |first= Christopher |last=Eppig|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-is-average-iq-higher-in-some-places |ref=harv}}</ref> Christopher Hassall and Thomas Sherratt repeated the analysis, and concluded "that infectious disease may be the only really important predictor of average national IQ".<ref name="Eppig 2011" />

== Effects of other diseases ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Intelligence quotient]] -->
There are numerous diseases affecting the [[central nervous system]] which can cause cognitive impairment. Many of these are associated with aging. Some common examples include [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Multi-infarct dementia]]. Many diseases may be [[neurological]] or [[psychiatric]] and may primarily affect the brain. Others may affect many other organs, like [[HIV]], [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] causing [[hypothyroidism]], or [[cancer]].

[[Major depression]], affecting about 16% of the population on at least one occasion in their lives and the leading cause of disability in North America, may give symptoms similar to dementia. Patients treated for depression score higher on IQ tests than before treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sackeim HA, Freeman J, McElhiney M, Coleman E, Prudic J, Devanand DP |title=Effects of major depression on estimates of intelligence |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=268–88 |year=1992 |month=March |pmid=1572949 |doi=10.1080/01688639208402828 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mandelli L |title=Improvement of cognitive functioning in mood disorder patients with depressive symptomatic recovery during treatment: an exploratory analysis |journal=Psychiatry Clin.

===Myopia and hyperopia===
A 2008 literature review writes that studies in several nations have found a relationship between [[myopia]] and higher IQ and between myopia and school achievement. Several, but not all, studies have found [[hyperopia]] to be associated with lower IQ and school achievements. A common explanation for myopia is near-work. Regarding the relationship to IQ, several explanations have been proposed. One is that the myopic child is better adapted at reading, and reads and studies more, which increases intelligence. The reverse explanation is that the intelligent and studious child reads more which causes myopia. Another is that the myopic child have an advantage at IQ testing which is near work because of less eye strain. Still another explanation is that [[pleiotropic]] gene(s) affect the size of both brain and eyes simultaneously.<ref>{{cite pmid|19127804}}</ref> A study of Chinese schoolchildren found that after controlling for age, gender, school, parental myopia, father’s education, and books read per week, myopia was still associated with high nonverbal IQ. Nonverbal IQ was a more important explanation than books read per week.<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1167/iovs.03-1296}}</ref>
