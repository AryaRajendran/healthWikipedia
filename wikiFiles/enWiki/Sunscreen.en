'''Sunscreen''' (also commonly known as ''sunblock'', ''sun tan lotion'', ''sun screen'', ''sunburn cream'', ''sun cream'' or ''block out'')<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=3007 | title=Preventing melanoma | publisher=Cancer Research UK | accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref> is a [[lotion]], spray, gel or other [[topical]] product that absorbs or reflects some of the [[sun]]'s [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation on the [[skin]] exposed to [[sunlight]] and thus helps protect against [[sunburn]]. [[Skin whitening|Skin-lightening products]] have sunscreen to protect lightened skin because light skin is more susceptible to sun damage than darker skin. A number of sunscreens have tanning powder to help the skin to darken or tan; however, tanning powder does not provide protection from [[UV rays]].

Sunscreens contain one or more of the following ingredients:
* [[organic chemistry|Organic chemical]] compounds that absorb ultraviolet light.
* Inorganic [[Suspended solids|particulates]] that reflect, scatter, and absorb UV light (such as [[titanium dioxide]], [[zinc oxide]], or a combination of both).
* Organic particulates that mostly absorb light like organic chemical compounds, but contain multiple [[chromophores]], may reflect and scatter a fraction of light like inorganic particulates, and behave differently in formulations than organic chemical compounds. An example is [[Bisoctrizole|Tinosorb M]]. Since the UV-attenuating efficacy depends strongly on particle size, the material is micronised to particle sizes below 200&nbsp;nm. The mode of action of this photostable filter system is governed to about 90% by absorption and 10% by scattering of UV light.

Depending on the mode of action sunscreens can be classified into physical sunscreens (i.e., those that reflect the sunlight) or chemical sunscreens (i.e., those that absorb the UV light).<ref name ="pharmax">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-4a-sunscreens/ Sunscreens | The Ageing Skin]</ref>

Medical organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of developing [[squamous cell carcinomas]] and [[basal-cell carcinoma]]s.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/ped_7_1_What_You_Need_To_Know_About_Skin_Cancer.asp What You Need To Know About Skin Cancer]</ref> However, the use of sunscreens is controversial for various reasons. Many sunscreens do not block [[ultraviolet A|UVA]] radiation, which does not cause sunburn but can increase the rate of [[melanoma]], another kind of [[skin cancer]], and [[photodermatitis]], so people using sunscreens may be exposed to high UVA levels without realizing it.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Terence SC Poon, Ross StC Barnetson and Gary M Halliday | title= Prevention of Immunosuppression by Sunscreens in Humans Is Unrelated to Protection from Erythema and Dependent on Protection from Ultraviolet A in the Face of Constant Ultraviolet B Protection | journal= J Invest Dermatol | volume=121 | pages=184–90 | year=2003 | (2003) 121, 184–190.}}</ref> The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreens can address this concern.

Although sunscreen is sometimes called "suntan lotion", the latter is different in that it is used to intensify UV rays whereas the former is used to block UV rays.

== History ==
The first effective sunscreen may have been developed by chemist Franz Greiter in 1946. The product, called ''Gletscher Crème'' (Glacier Cream), subsequently became the basis for the company [[Piz Buin (brand)|Piz Buin]] (named in honor of the place Greiter allegedly obtained the sunburn that inspired his concoction), which is still today a marketer of sunscreen products.<ref>[http://www.pizbuin.com/v1/en/brand_story.html 70 years since the PIZ BUIN mountain inspired a man to invent the world's first sun protection cream]</ref> It has been estimated that ''Gletscher Crème'' had a sun protection factor of 2.

The first widely used sunscreen was produced by Benjamin Green, an airman and later a [[pharmacist]], in 1944. The product, Red Vet Pet (for red veterinary petrolatum), had limited effectiveness, working as a physical blocker of ultraviolet radiation. It was a disagreeable red, sticky substance similar to petroleum jelly. This product was developed during the height of [[World War II]], when it was likely that the hazards of sun overexposure were becoming apparent to soldiers in the Pacific and to their families at home. Sales of this product boomed when [[Coppertone]] acquired the patent and marketed the substance under the [[Coppertone girl]] and [[Bain de Soleil]] branding in the early 1950s.

Franz Greiter is credited with introducing the concept of sun protection factor (SPF) in 1962, which has become a worldwide standard for measuring the effectiveness of sunscreen when applied at an even rate of 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). Some controversy exists over the usefulness of SPF measurements, especially whether the 2&nbsp;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> application rate is an accurate reflection of people’s actual use.

Newer sunscreens have been developed with the ability to better withstand contact with [[water]], [[heat]] and [[sweat]].

The sun protection factor of a sunscreen is a laboratory measure of the effectiveness of sunscreen — the higher the SPF, the more protection a sunscreen offers against UV-B (the ultraviolet radiation that causes [[sunburn]]).<ref name="pharmax" />

The SPF is the amount of UV radiation required to cause sunburn on skin with the sunscreen on, as a multiple of the amount required without the sunscreen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm106351.htm | title=Sunburn Protection Factor (SPF) | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] | date=2009-04-30 | accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref> There is a popular oversimplification of how SPF determines how long one can stay in the sun. For example, many users believe that, if they normally get sunburn in one hour, then an SPF 15 sunscreen allows them to stay in the sun fifteen hours (i.e. fifteen times longer) without getting sunburn. This would be true if the intensity of UV radiation were the same for the whole fifteen hours as in the one hour, but this is not normally the case. Intensity of solar radiation varies considerably with time of day. During early morning and late afternoon, the sun's radiation intensity is highly diminished since it must pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere while it is near the horizon.

In practice, the protection from a particular sunscreen depends, besides on SPF, on factors such as:
* The [[Human skin color|skin type]] of the user.
* The amount applied and frequency of re-application.
* Activities in which one engages (for example, swimming leads to a loss of sunscreen from the skin).
* Amount of sunscreen the skin has absorbed. 

The SPF is an imperfect measure of skin damage because invisible damage and skin aging are also caused by [[ultraviolet]] type A (UVA, wavelength 320 to 400 [[nanometre|nm]]), which does not cause reddening or pain. Conventional sunscreen blocks very little UVA radiation relative to the nominal SPF; broad-spectrum sunscreens are designed to protect against both UVB and UVA.<ref>{{cite pmid | 12118426}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi | 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12498.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi | 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.04.035}}</ref> According to a 2004 study, UVA also causes [[DNA]] damage to cells deep within the skin, increasing the risk of [[malignant melanoma]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Berneburg M, Plettenberg H, Medve-König K, Pfahlberg A, Gers-Barlag H, Gefeller O, Krutmann J | title=Induction of the photoaging-associated mitochondrial common deletion in vivo in normal human skin | journal=J Invest Dermatol | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=1277–83 | year=2004 | pmid=15140232 | doi=10.1111/j.0022-202X.2004.22502.x}}</ref> Even some products labeled "broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection" do not provide good protection against UVA rays.<ref>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12081374/ MSNBC.com : Sunscreen — protection or 'snake oil?']</ref> The best UVA protection is provided by products that contain [[zinc oxide]], [[avobenzone]], and [[ecamsule]]{{Citation needed | date=April 2012}}.

Owing to consumer confusion over the real degree and duration of protection offered, labeling restrictions are in force in several countries. In the [[EU]] sunscreen labels can only go up to SPF 50+ (actually indicating a SPF of 60 or higher)<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006H0647:EN:NOT | title=Commission Recommendation of 22 September 2006 on the efficacy of sunscreen products and the claims made relating thereto | publisher=Official Journal of the European Union | date=2006-09-22 | accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref> while [[Australia]]'s upper limit is 30+.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arpansa.gov.au/uvrg/rginfo_p13.cfm | title=UV Resource Guide - Sunscreens | publisher=Arpansa | date=2008-12-20 | accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref> In the 2007 and 2011 draft rules, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) proposed a maximum SPF label of 50, to limit unrealistic claims.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/sunscreen/qa.htm Questions and Answers on the 2007 Sunscreen Proposed Rule<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="fda2011">{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/UnderstandingOver-the-CounterMedicines/ucm258468.htm | title=Questions and Answers: FDA announces new requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen products marketed in the U.S. | date=2011-06-23 | accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref>

Others have proposed restricting the active ingredients to an SPF of no more than 50, due to lack of evidence that higher dosages provide more meaningful protection (especially due to the logarithmic nature of the scale).<ref name="onpoint">{{cite web | url=http://onpoint.wbur.org/2011/06/16/sunscreen | date=2011-06-16 | accessdate=2012-04-10 | title=Sunscreen Takes Some Heat: New Dangers, New Rules}}</ref>

[[Image:erythemal action spectrum.svg|thumb | 300px | UV-B sunlight spectrum (on a summer day in the Netherlands), along with the CIE Erythemal action spectrum. The effective spectrum is the product of the former two.]]

The SPF can be measured by applying sunscreen to the skin of a volunteer and measuring how long it takes before sunburn occurs when exposed to an artificial sunlight source. In the US, such an ''[[in vivo]]'' test is required by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. It can also be measured ''[[in vitro]]'' with the help of a specially designed [[spectrometer]]. In this case, the actual [[transmittance]] of the sunscreen is measured, along with the degradation of the product due to being exposed to sunlight. In this case, the transmittance of the sunscreen must be measured over all wavelengths in the UV-B range (290–320&nbsp;nm), along with a table of how effective various wavelengths are in causing sunburn (the ''erythemal action spectrum'') and the actual intensity [[spectrum]] of sunlight (see the figure). Such ''in vitro'' measurements agree very well with ''in vivo'' measurements.<ref>[http://www.optometrics.com/corporate/support/KFDA.html Optometrics products<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Numerous methods have been devised for evaluation of UVA and UVB protection. The most reliable spectrophotochemical methods eliminate the subjective nature of grading [[erythema]].<ref>Dominique Moyal "How to measure UVA protection afforded by suncreen products" www.medscape.com/viewarticle/576849</ref>

Mathematically, the SPF is calculated from measured data as
:<math>\mathrm{SPF} = \frac{\int A(\lambda) E(\lambda)d\lambda}{\int A(\lambda) E(\lambda)/\mathrm{MPF}(\lambda) \, d\lambda},</math>
where <math>E(\lambda)</math> is the solar irradiance spectrum, <math>A(\lambda)</math> the erythemal action spectrum, and <math>\mathrm{MPF}(\lambda)</math> the monochromatic protection factor, all functions of the wavelength <math>\lambda</math>. The MPF is roughly the inverse of the transmittance at a given wavelength.

The above means that the SPF is not simply the inverse of the transmittance in the UV-B region. If that were true, then applying two layers of SPF 5 sunscreen would be equivalent to SPF 25 (5 times 5). The actual combined SPF is always lower than the square of the single-layer SPF.

=== Measurements of UVA protection ===

====Persistent pigment darkening (PPD)====
The persistent pigment darkening (PPD) method is a method of measuring UVA protection, similar to the SPF method of measuring UVB light protection. Originally developed in Japan, it is the preferred method used by manufacturers such as [[L'Oréal]].

Instead of measuring [[erythema]] or reddening of the skin, the PPD method uses UVA radiation to cause a persistent darkening or tanning of the skin. Theoretically, a sunscreen with a PPD rating of 10 should allow a person 10 times as much UVA exposure as would be without protection. The PPD method is an ''[[in vivo]]'' test like SPF. In addition, Colipa has introduced a method that, it is claimed, can measure this ''[[in vitro]]'' and provide parity with the PPD method.<ref>[http://www.colipa.com/site/index.cfm?SID=15588&OBJ=28546&back=1 Colipa UVA method]</ref>

=== SPF equivalence ===
[[File:UVA logo.svg| thumb | 125px | The UVA seal used in the [[EU]]]]

As part of revised guidelines for sunscreens in the EU, there is a requirement to provide the consumer with a minimum level of UVA protection in relation to the SPF. This should be a UVA PF of at least 1/3 of the SPF to carry the UVA seal. The implementation of this seal is in its phase-in period,{{when | date=April 2012}} so a sunscreen without it may already offer this protection.<ref>[http://www.colipa.com/site/index.cfm?SID=15588&OBJ=26368&back=1 www.colipa.com]{{dead link | date=April 2012}}</ref>

A set of final U.S. FDA rules effective from summer 2012 defines the phrase "broad spectrum" as having a UVA SPF at least as high as the UVB SPF.<ref name="fda2011" />

==== Star rating system ====
In the UK and Ireland, the [[Boots (chemist)|Boots]] star rating system is a proprietary ''[[in vitro]]'' method used to describe the ratio of UVA to UVB protection offered by sunscreen creams and sprays. Based on original work by Prof. Brian Diffey at Newcastle University, the Boots Company in Nottingham, UK, developed a standard method that has been adopted by most companies marketing these products in the UK. The [[logo]] and methodology of the test are licenced for a token fee to any manufacturer or brand of sunscreens that are sold in the Boots retail chain, provided the products to which the logo is applied perform to the standard claimed. Own Label products exclusively sold in other retailers are now excluded from the terms of the licence.
It should not be confused with SPF, which is measured with reference to burning and UVB. One-star products provide the least ratio of UVA protection; five-star products are best. The method has recently been revised in the light of the Colipa UVA PF test, and with the new EU recommendations regarding UVA PF. The method still uses a [[spectrophotometer]] to measure absorption of UVA vs UVB; the difference stems from a requirement to pre-irradiate samples (where this was not previously required) to give a better indication of UVA protection, and of photostability when the product is used. With the current methodology, the lowest rating is three stars, the highest being five stars.
In August 2007, the FDA put out for consultation the proposal that a version of this protocol be used to inform users of American product of the protection that it gives against UVA,<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/sunscreen/qa.htm] Questions and Answers on the 2007 Sunscreen Proposed Rule</ref> but after concern this would be too confusing this was not adopted.<ref name="onpoint" />

==== PA system ====
Asian brands, particularly Japanese ones, tend to use The Protection Grade of UVA (PA) system to measure the UVA protection a sunscreen provides.

The Protection Grade of UVA (PA) system is based on the PPD reaction and is now widely adopted on the labels of sunscreens. According to the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association PA+ corresponds to a UVA protection factor between two and four, PA++ between four and eight, and PA+++ more than eight.

==Sunblock is a type of sunscreen==
[[File:SPF15SunBlock.JPG|thumb | 175px | | A tube of SPF 15 sun block lotion]]

Sunblock typically refers to opaque sunscreen that is effective at blocking both UVA and UVB rays and uses a heavy carrier oil to resist being washed off. [[Titanium dioxide]] and [[zinc oxide]] are two of the important ingredients in sunblock. Unlike the organic sun-blocking agents used in many sunscreens, these metal oxides do not degrade with exposure to sunlight.

The use of the word "sunblock" in the marketing of sunscreens is controversial. The FDA has considered banning such use because it can lead consumers to overestimate the effectiveness of products so labeled.<ref>http://www.ewg.org/2010sunscreen/faqs-2010/#28</ref>

For total protection against damage from the sun, the skin needs to be protected from UVA, UVB and IRA ([[infrared]] light). Roughly 35% of solar energy is IRA.<ref>P. Schroeder, PhD and J. Krutmann, MD [http://www.skintherapyletter.com/2010/15.4/2.html What is Needed for a Sunscreen to Provide Complete Protection]</ref>

As a defense against UV radiation, the amount of the brown pigment [[melanin]] in the skin increases when exposed to moderate (depending on [[human skin color|skin type]]) levels of radiation; this is commonly known as a [[sun tan]]. The purpose of melanin is to absorb UV radiation and dissipate the energy as harmless heat, blocking the UV from damaging skin tissue. UVA gives a quick tan that lasts for days by oxidizing melanin that was already present and triggers the release of the melanin from melanocytes. UVB on the other hand yields a tan that takes roughly two days to develop because it stimulates the body to produce more melanin. The photochemical properties of melanin make it an excellent [[photoprotection|photoprotectant]].

Sunscreen chemicals, on the other hand, cannot dissipate the energy of the excited state as efficiently as melanin and therefore the penetration of sunscreen ingredients into the lower layers of the skin increases the amount of [[free radical]]s and [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).<ref name="Hanson"/>

Some sunscreen lotions now include compounds such as [[titanium dioxide]] and [[zinc oxide]], inert fillers which helps protect against UV rays via light scattering and physically blocking the light pathway into the dermal layers. Other UVA blocking compounds found in sunscreen include [[Avobenzone]]. There are also naturally occurring compounds found in rainforest plants that have been known to protect the skin from UV radiation damage, such as the fern ''[[Phlebodium aureum]]''.

Some sunscreen chemicals produce potentially harmful substances if they are illuminated while in contact with living cells.<ref name=Parsons>{{cite journal | year= 2001 | month= | title= Photosensitization of the Sunscreen Octyl p-Dimethylaminobenzoate b UVA in Human Melanocytes but not in Keratinocytes | journal= Photochemistry and Photobiology | volume= 73 | issue= 6 | pages=600–604 | id= | url= | doi= 10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0600:POTSOP>2.0.CO;2 | author1= Xu, C | author2= Green, Adele | author3= Parisi, Alfio | author4= Parsons, Peter G | pmid= 11421064}}</ref><ref name=Knowland1993>{{cite journal | title= Sunlight-induced mutagenicity of a common sunscreen ingredient | journal= FEBS Letters | volume= 324 | pages=309–313 | year=1993 | pmid= 8405372 | doi= 10.1016/0014-5793(93)80141-G | author1= Knowland, John | author2= McKenzie, Edward A | author3= McHugh, Peter J | author4= Cridland, Nigel A | issue=3}}</ref><ref name=Damiani1999>{{cite journal | title= Nitroxide radicals protect DNA from damage when illuminated in vitro in the presence of dibenzoylmethane and a common sunscreen ingredient | journal= Free Radic.

In one study of sunscreens, the authors write:

<blockquote>The question whether UV filters acts on or in the skin has so far not been fully answered. Despite the fact that an answer would be a key to improve formulations of sun protection products, many publications carefully avoid addressing this question.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chatelaine | first1 = E. | last2 = Gabard | first2 = B. | last3 = Surber | first3 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Skin penetration and sun protection factor of five UV filters: Effect of the vehicle | url = http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=68291&ProduktNr=224219&Ausgabe=228903&filename=68291.pdf | journal = Skin Pharmacol.

In an experiment by Hanson et al. that was published in 2006, the amount of harmful [[reactive oxygen species]] was measured in untreated and in sunscreen-treated skin. In the first 20 minutes the film of sunscreen had a protective effect and the number of ROS species was smaller. After 60 minutes, however, the amount of absorbed sunscreen was so high that the amount of ROS was higher in the sunscreen-treated skin than in the untreated skin.<ref name="Hanson"/> The authors emphasize that if enough sunscreen remains in the surface this effect would be eliminated, enhancing the message that sunscreen needs to be applied and reapplied sufficiently and correctly for it to work.
  
George Zachariadis and E Sahanidou of the Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, at Aristotle University, in Thessaloniki, Greece, have now carried out an [[ICP-AES]] analysis of several commercially available sunscreen creams and lotions. "The objective was the simultaneous determination of titanium and several minor, trace or toxic elements (aluminum, zinc, magnesium, iron, manganese, copper, chromium, lead, and bismuth) in the final products," the researchers say. They concluded that "Most of the commercial preparations that were studied showed generally good agreement to the ingredients listed on the product label." However, they also point out that the quantitative composition of the products tested cannot be assessed because the product labels usually do not provide a detailed break down of all ingredients and their concentrations. They also point out that, worryingly, their tests consistently revealed the presence of elements not cited in the product formulation, which emphasized the need for a standardized and official testing method for multi-element quality control of these products.<ref>{{cite journal | author=David Bradley | title=Toxic sunscreen testing | url=http://www.spectroscopynow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?id=22103&type=Feature&chId=1&page=1 year=2009 | month=August 15}}</ref>

They first detected the chemicals in greater than 95% of 2000 Americans tested, while the second found that mothers with high levels of oxybenzone in their bodies were more likely to give birth to underweight baby girls.<ref>[http://www.ewg.org/node/26212 CDC: Americans Carry Body Burden of Toxic Sunscreen Chemical | Environmental Working Group<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Concerns have been raised regarding the use of nanoparticles in sunscreen.<ref name="zotd">{{cite web | url=http://www.tga.gov.au/npmeds/sunscreen-zotd.htm | title=Safety of sunscreens containing nanoparticles of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide | date=February 2006 | accessdate=14 June 2009}}</ref> Theoretically, sunscreen nanoparticles could increase rates of certain cancers, or diseases similar to those caused by asbestos.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1084931/Revealed-The-toxic-nanoparticles-asbestos-like-properties-everyday-goods.html | title=Revealed: The toxic nanoparticles with asbestos-like properties found in everyday goods | author=Arthur Martin | date=12 November 2008 | accessdate=14 June 2009 | location=London | work=Daily Mail}}</ref>
In 2006 the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia concluded a study and found:

"There is evidence from isolated cell experiments that zinc oxide and titanium dioxide can induce free radical formation in the presence of light and that this may damage these cells (photo-mutagenicity with zinc oxide). However, this would only be of concern in people using sunscreens if the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide penetrated into viable skin cells. The weight of current evidence is that they remain on the surface of the skin and in the outer dead layer (stratum corneum) of the skin." <ref name="zotd"/>

===Vitamin D===
Artificial sunscreen absorbs ultraviolet light and prevents it from reaching the skin. It has been reported that sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 based on the UVB spectrum can decrease vitamin D synthetic capacity by 95 percent, whereas sunscreen with an SPF of 15 can reduce synthetic capacity by 98 percent (Matsuoka et al., 1987).<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56078/</ref>

This was leading to deficiency in Australia after a government campaign to increase sunscreen use.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/12/08/1196813083745.html | title=Slip, slop, crack: the vitamin D crisis - National | publisher=theage.com.au | date= 2007-12-09 | accessdate=2009-09-25 | location=Melbourne | first=Reid | last=Sexton}}</ref> Doctors recommend spending small amounts of time in the sun ''without'' sun protection to ensure adequate production of vitamin D.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/be-sunsmart-avoid-bone-dgeneration-risks/2007/12/08/1196813083751.html | title=Be sun-smart, avoid bone D-generation risks - National | publisher=theage.com.au | date= 2007-12-09 | accessdate=2009-09-25 | location=Melbourne | first1=Reid | last1=Sexton | first2=Louise | last2=Hall}}</ref> When the [[UV index]] is greater than 3 (which occurs daily within the [[tropics]] and daily during the spring and summer seasons in [[temperate region]]s) adequate amounts of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can be made in the skin after only ten to fifteen minutes of sun exposure at least two times per week to the face, arms, hands, or back without sunscreen. With longer exposure to UVB rays, an equilibrium is achieved in the skin, and the vitamin simply degrades as fast as it is generated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp | title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin D | publisher=National Institutes of Health | accessdate=2007-09-10 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5Rl5u0LB5 | archivedate=2007-09-10}}</ref>

== Active ingredients ==
The principal ingredients in sunscreens are usually [[aromaticity|aromatic]] molecules [[conjugated system|conjugated]] with [[carbonyl]] groups. This general structure allows the molecule to absorb high-energy ultraviolet rays and release the energy as lower-energy rays, thereby preventing the skin-damaging ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin. So, upon exposure to UV light, most of the ingredients (with the notable exception of [[avobenzone]]) do not undergo significant chemical change, allowing these ingredients to retain the UV-absorbing potency without significant [[photodegradation]].<ref name= CTFA1998 /> A chemical stabilizer is included in some sunscreens containing avobenzone to slow its breakdown - examples include formulations containing [[Helioplex]]<ref>[http://www.realsimplerewards.com/rsn/microsites/neutrogena_helioplex.html Neutrogena | How Helioplex Works]</ref> and AvoTriplex.<ref>[http://www.bananaboat.com/avotriplex/index.html Banana Boat AvoTriplex]</ref> The stability of avobenzone can also be improved by [[bemotrizinol]],<ref>{{cite journal

<sup>*</sup> Time and Extent Application (TEA), Proposed Rule on FDA approval expected 2009

==Application==
{{Howto | section | date=October 2009}}
[[Image:Man sitting under beach umbrella.JPG|upright | right | thumb | Protection of the skin through use of a beach umbrella]]

Excessive exposure to direct sunlight is potentially harmful. Excessive exposure can result in [[sunburn]] if a person does not wear [[sun protective clothing]] or use suitable sunscreen. Products with a higher SPF ([[Sunscreen#Sun Protection Factor|Sun Protection Factor]]) level provide greater protection against ultraviolet radiation. However, in 1998, the Annual Meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] reported that some sunscreens advertising UVA and UVB protection do not provide adequate safety from UVA radiation and could give sun tanners a false sense of protection. A sunscreen should also be [[hypoallergenic]] and noncomedogenic so it does not cause a rash or clog the pores, which can cause [[acne]].

For those choosing to tan, some dermatologists recommend the following preventative measures:

* Sunscreens that should block both UVA and UVB rays are called ''broad-spectrum sunscreens''.
* Sunscreens need to be applied thickly enough to get the full SPF protection.
* Sunscreens should be applied 15 to 30 minutes before exposure, followed by one reapplication 15 to 30 minutes after the sun exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary only after activities such as swimming, sweating, and rubbing.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Diffey, B.L. | title=When should sunscreen be reapplied? | journal= J Am Acad Dermatol. | year=2001 | volume=45 | page=882 | pages=882–5 | doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.117385 | pmid=11712033 | issue=6}}</ref>
* Sun rays are strongest between 10 am and 4 pm.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/sunwise/actionsteps.htm{{Dead link | date=October 2009}}</ref> Sun rays are stronger at higher [[elevation]]s (mountains) and [[latitude]]s near the [[equator]].
* Wearing a hat with a brim and anti-UV sunglasses can provide almost 100% protection against ultraviolet radiation's entering the eyes.
* Reflective surfaces like snow and water can greatly increase the amount of UV radiation to which the skin is exposed.

Recent evidence indicates that [[caffeine]] and [[caffeine sodium benzoate]] increase UVB-induced [[apoptosis]] both in topical and oral applications. In mice, UVB-induced [[hyperplasia]] was greatly reduced with administration of these substances. Although studies in humans remain untested, caffeine and caffeine sodium benzoate may be novel inhibitors of [[skin cancer]].<ref name=Conney2008>{{cite journal | author=Conney, Allan H | title=Effect of Caffeine on UVB-induced Carcinogenesis, Apoptosis, and the Elimination of UVB-induced Patches of p53 Mutant Epidermal Cells in SKH-1 Mice | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/php/2008/00000084/00000002/art00010 | journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology | pages=330–338 | year=2008 | pmid=18179623 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00263.x | volume=84 | last2=Kramata | first2=P | last3=Lou | first3=YR | last4=Lu | first4=YP | issue=2}}</ref>

===Dosage===
The dose used in [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] sunscreen testing is 2.2&nbsp;mg/cm² of exposed skin.<ref name= CTFA1998>{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/00/Sep00/090600/c000573_10_Attachment_F.pdf | title=Re: Tentative Final Monograph for OTC Sunscreen | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] | date=1998-09-11 | accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref> Provided one assumes an "average" adult build of height 5&nbsp;ft 4 in (163&nbsp;cm) and weight 150&nbsp;lb (68&nbsp;kg) with a 32 in (82&nbsp;cm) waist, that adult wearing a bathing suit covering the groin area should apply 29 g (approximately 1&nbsp;oz) evenly to the uncovered body area. Considering only the face, this translates to about 1/4 to 1/3 of a teaspoon for the average adult face. Larger individuals should scale these quantities accordingly.

Contrary to the common advice that sunscreen should be reapplied every 2–3 hours, research has shown that the best protection is achieved by dividing the SPF number in half and reapplying that many minutes after sun exposure begins. For example, if the SPF is 30, sunscreen should be reapplied once after 15 minutes of exposure. Further reapplication is only necessary after activities such as swimming, sweating, or rubbing/wiping.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Diffey B | title=When should sunscreen be reapplied? | url= | journal=J Am Acad Dermatol | volume=45 | issue=6 | pages=882–5 | year=2001 | pmid=11712033 | doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.117385}}</ref>

More recent research at the [[University of California, Riverside]], indicates that sunscreen must be reapplied within two hours in order to remain effective. Not reapplying could even cause more cell damage than not using sunscreen at all, due to the release of extra [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] from those sunscreen chemicals that were [[sunscreen controversy#absorption of photoactive sunscreen ingredients into the skin|absorbed into the skin]].<ref name="Hanson">{{cite journal | author=Kerry M. Hanson, Enrico Gratton and Christopher J.

===Label regulations===
Updated package labeling standards in the [[United States]] have been under development since 1978.

A set of final [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] rules effective from summer 2012 bans "waterproof" claims, instead requiring claims of 40 or 80 minutes "water-resistant" protection. It also requires a standardized "Drug Facts" label and requires specific FDA approval for "sunblock" and "instant protection" labels. Claims of protection over two hours are not allowed without specific approval.<ref name="fda2011" />

However, the compliance dates for these new sunscreen labeling requirements, published in June 2011, have been delayed by 6 months. The new implementation date for products with annual sales less than US $25,000 is December 17, 2013 and that for all other products is December 17, 2012.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11390.pdf Labeling and Effectiveness Testing; Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Delay of Compliance Dates] Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>

Due to requests by several trade associations and the personal care industry, the FDA ultimately decided to extend the implementation period for 6 months from the original compliance date. This decision allows manufacturers adequate time for thorough testing and the full implementation of the new labeling requirements which cover:
* Broad Spectrum designation
* Use claims
* "Waterproof," "sweatproof" or "sunblock" claims
* Water resistance claims
* Drug facts
* Maximum [[Sunscreen#Sun protection factor (SPF) and labeling requirements|SPF]] value on sunscreen labels to "50 +"

These changes shall enable consumers to identify and select suitable sunscreen products offering protection from sunburn, early skin aging and skin cancer.<ref>[http://newsletter.sgs.com/eNewsletterPro/uploadedimages/000006/sgs-safeguards-10412-us-fda-extends-deadline-for-new-sunscreen-labeling-requirements-a4-en-12.pdf US FDA Delays Implementation Deadlines for Sunscreen Labeling Requirements] SGS SafeGuard Bulletin, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>

==Hair care==
Sunscreening agents are used in some hair care products such as shampoos, conditioners and styling agents to protect against protein degradation and color loss. Currently, [[benzophenone-4]] and [[ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate]] are the two sunscreens most commonly used in hair products. [[Cinnamidopyltrimonium chloride]] and a few others are used to a much less degree. The common sunscreens used on skin are rarely used for hair products due to their texture and weight effects.
