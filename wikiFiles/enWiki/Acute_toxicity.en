'''Acute toxicity''' describes the adverse effects of a substance that result either from a single exposure<ref name="msds">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/acutetoxicity.html|title=The MSDS HyperGlossary: Acute toxicity|accessdate = 2006-11-15|publisher=Safety Emporium| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061016141309/http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/acutetoxicity.html| archivedate= 16 October 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> or from multiple exposures in a short space of time (usually less than 24&nbsp;hours).<ref name="IUPAC">{{GoldBookRef|title=acute toxicity|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/AT06800.html}}</ref> To be described as ''acute'' toxicity, the adverse effects should occur within 14&nbsp;days of the administration of the substance.<ref name="IUPAC"/>

Acute toxicity is distinguished from [[chronic toxicity]], which describes the adverse health effects from repeated exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer time period (months or years).

It is widely considered unethical to use humans as '''test''' subjects for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be gained from investigating accidental human exposures (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from [[animal testing]] or, more recently, ''[[in vitro]]'' testing methods and [[Statistical inference|inference]] from data on similar substances.<ref name="msds"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Walum E |title=Acute oral toxicity |journal=Environ.

== Measures of acute toxicity ==
=== Regulatory values ===
Limits for short-term exposure, such as STELs or CVs, are defined only if there is a particular acute toxicity associated with a substance.  
*[[Short-Term Exposure Limit]], STEL; [[Threshold limit value-short-term exposure limit]], TLV-STEL
*[[Ceiling value]], CV; [[Threshold limit value-ceiling]], TLV-C

=== Experimental values ===
*[[No-observed-adverse-effect level]], NOAEL
*[[Lowest-observed-adverse-effect level]], LOAEL
*[[Maximum tolerable concentration]], MTC, LC<sub>0</sub>; [[Maximum tolerable dose]], MTD, LD<sub>0</sub>
*[[Minimum lethal concentration]], LC<sub>min</sub>; [[Minimum lethal dose]], LD<sub>min</sub>
*[[Median lethal concentration]], LC<sub>50</sub>; [[Median lethal dose]], LD<sub>50</sub>; [[Median lethal time]], LT<sub>50</sub>
*[[Absolute lethal concentration]], LC<sub>100</sub>; [[Absolute lethal dose]], LD<sub>100</sub>
