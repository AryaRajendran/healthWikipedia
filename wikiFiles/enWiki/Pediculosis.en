== Classification ==
Pediculosis may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{Rp|446-8}}

==Head lice==
{{Main|Pediculosis capitis}}

===Presentation===
Head-lice infestation is most frequent on children aged 3–10 and their families.  Approximately 3% of school children in the United States contract head lice.<ref name=Leung>{{cite journal |author=Leung AKC and Robson LM |title=Pruritis in Children: What's Itching? |journal=Consultant for Pediatricians |date=May 1, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/consultant-for-pediatricians/article/1145470/1405287}}</ref>

Females are more frequently infested than males. Those of African descent rarely suffer infestation due to differences in hair texture.<ref name="merck_lice">{{cite web |title=Lice (Pediculosis) |publisher= |date=2005 November|work=The Merck Manual |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec10/ch121/ch121e.html | accessdate=2008-02-19 }}</ref>

Head lice are spread through direct head-to-head contact with an infested person. From each egg or "nit" may hatch one nymph that will grow and develop to the adult louse. 

Lice feed on blood once or more often each day by piercing the skin with their tiny needle-like mouthparts. While feeding they excrete saliva, which irritates the skin and causes itching.<ref name=Leung/>

Lice cannot burrow into the skin.

===Diagnosis===
To diagnose infestation, the entire scalp should be combed thoroughly with a louse comb and the teeth of the comb should be examined for the presence of living lice after each time the comb passes through the hair. The use of a louse comb is the most effective way to detect living lice.<ref name="PedDerm">{{cite journal |author=Mumcuoglu KY, Friger M, Ioffe-Uspensky I, Ben-Ishai F, Miller J |title=Louse comb versus direct visual examination for the diagnosis of head louse infestations |journal=Pediatr Dermatol |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=9–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11207962 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1470.2001.018001009.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0736-8046&date=2001&volume=18&issue=1&spage=9}}</ref> 

The most characteristic symptom of infestation is [[pruritus]] (itching) on the head which normally intensifies 3 to 4 weeks after the initial infestation. The bite reaction is very mild and it can be rarely seen between the hairs. 

The most common symptom of lice infestation is itching. Excessive scratching of the infested areas can cause sores, which may become infected. In addition, body lice can be a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for [[louse-borne typhus]], [[louse-borne relapsing fever]] or [[trench fever]].

===Treatment===
The number of diagnosed cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s, reaching hundreds of millions annually.<ref name="Gratz">{{cite journal| last =Gratz | first =N. | title =Human lice, their prevalence and resistance to insecticides | publisher =[[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] | location =[[Geneva]] | year =1998 }}</ref>  There is no product or method which assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment.  However, there are a number of treatment modalities that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments, natural products, combs, shaving, hot air, and silicone-based lotions.

===Epidemiology===
About 6-12 million people, mainly children, are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. Only a small proportion of those treated, however, may have objective evidence of an extant infestation.<ref name="pmid=10959734">{{cite journal| last =Pollack | first =Richard | title =Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America | journal =Pediatr Infect Dis J | volume = 19| pages =689-693 | date =2000 | url =http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/2000/08000/Overdiagnosis_and_consequent_mismanagement_of_head.3.aspx }}</ref> High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world including Denmark, Sweden, U.K., France and Australia.<ref name="pmid14651472">{{cite journal| last =Burgess | first =Ian | title =Human Lice and their Control | journal =Annual Review of Entomology | volume =49 | pages =457–481 | publisher =[[Annual Reviews]] | date =January 2004 | url =http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ento.49.061802.123253 | doi =10.1146/annurev.ento.49.061802.123253 |pmid=14651472 }}</ref><ref name="JDD">{{cite journal| last =Mumcuoglu | first =Kosta Y. | coauthors =Barker CS, Burgess IF, Combescot-Lang C, Dagleish RC, Larsen KS, Miller J, Roberts RJ, Taylan-Ozkan A. | title =International Guidelines for Effective Control of Head Louse Infestations | journal =Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume =6 | pages =409–14 | year =2007 |pmid=17668538| issue =4 }}</ref>
Normally head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, brushes, towels, clothing, beds or closets. Head-to-head contact is by far the most common route of lice transmission.

The United Kingdom's National Health Service, and many American health agencies,<ref>http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cd/cdped.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/head-lice/Pages/Introduction.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.worsleyschool.net/science/files/lice/page.html</ref> report that lice "prefer" clean hair, because it's easier to attach eggs and to cling to the strands. 

[[Head lice]] (''Pediculus humanus capitis'') are not known to be vectors of diseases, unlike body lice (''Pediculus humanus humanus''), which are known vectors of epidemic or louse-borne typhus (''Rickettsia prowazeki''), trench fever (''Rochalimaea quintana'') and louse-borne relapsing fever (''Borrellia recurrentis'').

==Body lice==
{{main|Pediculosis corporis}}

This condition, is caused by [[body louse]] (''Pediculus humanus humanus'', sometimes called ''Pediculus humanus corporis''<ref name="buxton2">{{cite book

}}</ref>) is a [[louse]] which infests humans and is adapted to lay eggs in clothing, rather than at the base of hairs, and is thus of recent evolutionary origin. Pediculosis is a more serious threat due to possible contagion of diseases such as [[typhus]]. Epidemiology and treatment of human body lice is described in the article on [[body lice]].

==Pubic lice==
{{main|Pediculosis pubis}}

The pubic or [[crab louse]] (''Pthirus pubis'') is a parasitic insect which spends its entire life on human hair and feeds exclusively on blood. Humans are the only known host of this parasite, although it is more closely related to the louse parasites in other primate species, than are human head or body lice which probably evolved from it as the "original" louse infestation of humans. Epidemiology and treatment of pubic lice is discussed in the article on [[pubic lice]].

==In other animals==

Pediculosis is more common in cattle than any other type of domesticated animal.<ref name="Hussain">{{cite journal

===Treatment===

Cattle infested with bovine pediculosis are generally treated chemically, by drugs like [[ivermectin]] and [[cypermethrin]].

== History ==

In the 15th century, topical mercury treatment was used to treat pediculosis.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Fornaciari | first=G | coauthors=Giuffra V, Marinozzi S et al. | title='Royal' pediculosis in Renaissance Italy: lice in the mummy of the King of Naples Ferdinand II of Aragon (1467-1496) | journal=Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz | volume=104 | issue=4 | pages=671–672 | month=July | year=2009 | pmid=19722098 | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0074-02762009000400026&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en }}</ref>
