The '''ACTH test''' (also called the '''[[cosyntropin]] test''', '''[[tetracosactide]] test''' or '''Synacthen test''') is a [[medical test]] usually ordered and interpreted by [[endocrinologist]]s to assess the functioning of the [[adrenal gland]]s stress response by measuring the adrenal response to [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).<ref name="pmid12899587">{{cite journal |author=Dorin RI, Qualls CR, Crapo LM |title=Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency |journal=[[Ann.

This test is used to diagnose or exclude primary and secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]], [[Addison's disease]] and related conditions.<ref name="003696.htm" />  In addition to quantifying adrenal insufficiency, the test can distinguish whether the cause is adrenal (low cortisol and aldosterone production) or pituitary (low ACTH production).<ref name="pmid12899587">{{cite journal |author=Dorin RI, Qualls CR, Crapo LM |title=Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency |journal=Ann.

Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, or sooner if the patient presents in apparent adrenal crisis.<ref name="adrenalframe13.htm">{{cite journal| author=Evangelia Charmandari, M.D., and George P.

==Versions of the test==
This test can be given as a ''low-dose short test'', a ''conventional-dose short test'', or as a ''prolonged-stimulation test''.

In the low-dose short test, 1&nbsp;µg/kg of an ACTH drug is injected into the patient.  In the conventional-dose short test, 250&nbsp;µg of drug are injected.  Both of these short tests last for about an hour and provide the same information.  Studies have shown the cortisol response of the adrenals is the same for the low-dose and conventional-dose tests.<ref name="emed_ckb_ref_0">{{cite journal | author=Abdu TA; Elhadd TA; Neary R; Clayton RN | title=Comparison of the low dose short synacthen test (1 microg), the conventional dose short synacthen test (250 microg), and the insulin tolerance test for assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with pituitary disease|journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | year=1999 | url=http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/10084558?src=emed_ckb_ref_0 | doi=10.1210/jc.84.3.838 | volume=84 | pages=838–43 | issue=3 | pmid=10084558}}</ref><ref name="pmid20626639">{{cite journal | author = Cemeroglu AP, Kleis L, Postellon DC, Wood MA | title = COMPARISON OF LOW AND HIGH DOSE COSYNTROPIN STIMULATION TESTING IN CHILDREN | journal = [[Pediatrics International : Official Journal of the Japan Pediatric Society]] | volume = 53| issue = 2| pages = 175–80| year = 2010 | month = July | pmid = 20626639 | doi = 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2010.03203.x | url =  }}</ref>

The prolonged-stimulation test, which is also called a ''long conventional-dose test'', can last up to 48 hours.  This form of the test can differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary adrenal insufficiency.  This form of the test is rarely performed because earlier testing of cortisol and ACTH levels in association with the short test may provide all the necessary information.<ref name="adrenalframe13.htm"/>

== Preparation ==
The person must fast at least 8 hours before the test which should be started by 10 am, but as close to 7 am as possible. The test shouldn't be given if on [[glucocorticoids]], or adrenal extract supplement as these will affect test results. Stress and recently administered [[radioisotope]] scans{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed for radioisotope scans|date=August 2012}} can artificially increase levels and may invalidate test results. [[Spironolactone]], [[contraceptives]], [[licorice]], [[estrogen]], [[androgen]] (including [[DHEA]]) and [[progesterone]] therapy may also affect both aldosterone and cortisol stimulation test results. To stimulate aldosterone, consumption of salt should be reduced to a minimum and foods high in sodium avoided for 24 hours prior to testing. Women should ideally undergo testing during the first week of their menstrual cycle as aldosterone (and occasionally cortisol) may be falsely elevated in the luteal cycle secondary to progesterone inhibition, leading to a compensatory rise in aldosterone levels.<ref name = "91/10/3981">{{cite journal| author=Emily D.

== Administration ==
Traditionally, cortisol and ACTH levels (separate lavender top tube) are drawn at baseline (time = 0).  Next, synthetic ACTH (Synacthen aka [[Tetracosactide]] or Cortrosyn aka [[Cosyntropin]]) is injected IM or IV depending on the agent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drugs.com Citation|url=http://www.drugs.com/ppa/cosyntropin-synthetic-corticotropin-synthetic-acth.html}}</ref>  Approximately 20 mL of heparinized venous blood is collected at 30 and 60 minutes after the synthetic ACTH injection to measure cortisol levels.<ref name="ACTHRapidStimulationTest.html">{{cite journal| author=unknown | title=ACTH Rapid Stimulation Test (Cortrosyn, Cosyntropin)|url=http://www.clinlabnavigator.com/Tests/ACTHRapidStimulationTest.html}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref><ref name="addison.htm">{{cite journal| author=NIDDK's Office of Health Research Reports | title=Addison's disease |url=http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm}}</ref>

==Potential side effects==

Commonly reported reactions are nausea, anxious sweating, dizziness, itchy skin, redness and or swelling of injection site, palpitations (a fast or fluttering heart beat) and facial flushing (may also include arms and torso), but should disappear within a few hours.<ref name=synacthentrifold/><ref name="article.htm"/>  Rarely seen, but serious side effects include rash, fainting, headache, blurred vision, severe swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing, irregular heartbeat.<ref name="article.htm"/>

==Interpretation of results==

[[File:Illu adrenal gland.jpg|thumb|right||200px|The [[adrenal glands]] sit atop the kidneys.]]

===Cortisol stimulation===
In healthy individuals, the cortisol level should double from a baseline of 20-30&nbsp;µg/dl within 60 minutes. For example, if the serum cortisol level was 25&nbsp;ug/dl before the stimulation, it should reach at least 50&nbsp;µg/dl.

;Interpretation for primary adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease
The baseline cortisol level in people with adrenal insufficiency is usually near 15&nbsp;µg/dl.  An ACTH stimulation test that raises the cortisol concentration to 20&nbsp;µg/dl would support the diagnosis of primary [[adrenal insufficiency]].  In Addison's disease, baseline cortisol is well below 10&nbsp;µg/dl and rises no more than 25 percent.

;Interpretation for secondary adrenal insufficiency
ACTH may dramatically stimulate cortisol from the low baseline value encountered in patients suffering from secondary adrenal insufficiency.  Stimulation resulting in a greater than 14-fold increase in serum concentration over 30 minutes has been reported, although more typically serum cortisol levels will double or triple from baseline.  The lower the baseline cortisol, the more likely it is that the patient's cortisol will increase by a large amount.<ref name="Mosby's Diagnostic and Laboratory Test Reference 2nd ed."/>

In some instances, a second test can suggest primary adrenal insufficiency (cortisol value less than doubled).  The diagnosis may be changed from secondary to primary adrenal insufficiency or to include primary adrenal insufficiency.  In secondary adrenal insufficiency, if the adrenal glands lack ACTH for enough time, cortisol production can [[atrophy]]<ref name="ch153b.html">{{cite journal | author=Ashley B. Grossman, MD | title=Addison's Disease | journal=Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders|sect=Testing|year=2007|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/print/sec12/ch153/ch153b.html|page=4}}</ref> and fail to rise to a value at least double the base cortisol value.  It is proper to continue with the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.

If secondary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, the insulin tolerance test (ITT) or the CRH ([[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]]) stimulation test can be used to distinguish between a hypothalamic (tertiary) and pituitary (secondary) cause, but is rarely used in clinical practice.<ref name="ch153b.html"/>

===ACTH plasma test plus cortisol stimulation===
[[File:Pituitary gland.png|thumb|right|200px|Location of the [[pituitary gland]].]]
An ACTH plasma test should always be given at the same time as the ACTH stimulation, although many doctors consider the test inaccurate.  This test measures how much ACTH the pituitary gland is producing.  A healthy ACTH value should be just into the upper third of the range (assuming a range of 10–60&nbsp;ng/L).  The ACTH plasma and ACTH stimulation test together can give a clearer picture, especially for secondary adrenal insufficiency.<ref name="ACTHRapidStimulationTest.html"/>

;Interpretation for primary adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease
ACTH will be high<ref name="ACTHRapidStimulationTest.html"/> - either at the top or above range.  In Addison's disease, ACTH may be way above range and may reach the hundreds.  In very rare cases can reach the 1000s and 2000s.

;Interpretation for secondary adrenal insufficiency
ACTH will be low<ref name="ACTHRapidStimulationTest.html"/> - Usually below 35, but most people with secondary fall within the range limit.  Although uncommon, values for ACTH can reach into the low 40s.

In some cases, actual cause of low ACTH is from low CRH in the hypothalamus.  It is possible to have separate ACTH and CRH impairment such as can happen in a head injury.<ref name="L8psmoE71_MEP">{{cite journal| author=Lynnette K Nieman, MD | title=Corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test| year=2008 |url=http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~L8psmoE71_MEP}}</ref>

===Aldosterone stimulation===
The ACTH stimulation test is occasionally used to test adrenal production of aldosterone at the same time as cortisol to also help in determining if primary (hyperreninemic) or secondary (hyporeninemic) [[hypoaldosteronism]] is present.<ref name="Appendix09_ACTHa.pdf"/>  Human ACTH has a slight stimulatory effect on aldosterone,<ref name="s5ch7_7.htm">{{cite journal |author=unknown | title=Role of ACTH in Regulation and Action of Adrenocorticoids | pages = 7 of 52|url=http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch7/s5ch7_7.htm}}</ref> but the amount of synthetic ACTH given in the stimulation is equivalent to more than a whole days production of natural ACTH, so the aldosterone response can be easily measured in blood serum.<ref name="test.html">{{cite journal| author=unknown | title=Aldosterone and Renin | url=http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/aldosterone/test.html}}</ref>  Same as cortisol, aldosterone should double from a respectable base value (around 20&nbsp;ng/dl, must fast salt 24 hours and sit upright for blood draw) in a healthy individual.

;Interpretation for primary aldosterone deficiency
The aldosterone response in the ACTH stimulation test is blunted or absent in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency including Addison's disease.<ref name="Appendix09_ACTHa.pdf"/>  The base value is usually in the mid teens or less and rise to less than double the base value thus indicating primary hypoaldosteronism ([[sodium]] low, [[potassium]] and renin [[enzyme]] will be high) and is an indicator of primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease.

;Interpretation for secondary aldosterone deficiency
Aldosterone response of several factors from a low base value.  This factoring indicates secondary hypoaldosteronism (sodium low, potassium and renin enzyme will be low).  Usually doubling to quadrupling from a low base aldosterone value is what is seen in secondary adrenal insufficiency.  Decoupling of aldosterone in the ACTH stimulation test is possible (i.e. 2&nbsp;ng/dl stimming to 20).<ref name="abstract/122/5/2090">{{cite journal | author=L.A. Cunningham and M.A. Holzwarth | title=Vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulates adrenal aldosterone and corticosterone secretion | journal=[[Endocrinology (journal)|Endocrinology]]  | volume=122|pages=2090–2097|year=1988|url=http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/5/2090 | pmid=3359977 | doi=10.1210/endo-122-5-2090 | issue=5}}</ref>  A result of doubling of more of aldosterone may help in tandem with a cortisol stimulation that doubled or more confirm a diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.  In rare cases, an aldosterone stimulation which did not double, but with the presence of low potassium, low renin and low ACTH indicates atrophy of aldosterone production from the prolonged lack of renin.

Similar to the cortisol stimulation in ACTH deficiency, the test interpreter may lack knowledge of how to properly interpret for secondary hypoaldosteronism and think a result of aldosterone doubling or more from a low base value is good.
