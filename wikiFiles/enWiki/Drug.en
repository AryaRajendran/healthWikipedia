A '''drug''' is a [[Matter|substance]] which may have [[Medicine|medicinal]], [[Intoxicant|intoxicating]], [[Performance-enhancing drug|performance enhancing]] or other effects when taken or put into a [[human]] [[body]] or the body of another [[animal]] and is not considered a [[food]] or exclusively a food.

What is considered a drug rather than a food varies between [[culture]]s, and distinctions between drugs and foods and between kinds of drug are enshrined in [[law]]s which vary between [[jurisdiction]]s and aim to restrict or prevent drug use. Even within a jurisdiction, however, the status of a substance may be uncertain or contested with respect to both whether it is a drug and how it should be classified if at all. There is no single, precise definition, as there are different meanings in [[drug control law]], [[government regulation]]s, [[medicine]], and colloquial usage.<ref name="diccom">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drug "Drug."] ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)'', [[Random House|Random House, Inc.]], via dictionary.com. Retrieved on 20 September 2007.</ref>

In [[pharmacology]], a drug is "a [[chemical]] substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being."<ref name="diccom" /> Drugs may be prescribed for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic disorders]].<ref name="ahsci">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drug "Drug."] ''The American Heritage Science Dictionary'', [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], via dictionary.com. Retrieved on 20 September 2007.</ref>

[[Recreational drug use|Recreational drugs]] are chemical substances that affect the [[central nervous system]], such as [[opioid]]s or [[hallucinogen]]s.<ref name="ahsci" /> They may be used for perceived beneficial effects on [[perception]], [[consciousness]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], and [[behavior]].<ref name="ahsci" /><ref name="mwmed">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drug "Drug."] ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., via dictionary.com.

Drugs are usually distinguished from [[endogenous]] biochemicals by being introduced from outside the organism.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For example, [[insulin]] is a hormone that is synthesized in the body; it is called a hormone when it is synthesized by the pancreas inside the body, but if it is introduced into the body from outside, it is called a drug.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
Many natural substances, such as [[beer]]s, [[wine]]s, and [[psychoactive mushrooms]], blur the line between food and recreational drugs, as when ingested they affect the functioning of both [[mind]] and [[body]] and some substances normally considered drugs such as DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) are actually produced by the human body in trace amounts.

== Etymology ==
Drug is thought to originate from Old French "drogue", possibly deriving later into "droge-vate" from Middle Dutch meaning "dry barrels", referring to medicinal plants preserved in them.<ref name="etymonline-drug">{{OEtymD|drug}}</ref>

== Medication ==
[[File:Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) pills.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nexium]] pills 40 mg<br> (esomeprazole magnesium)]]
{{Main|pharmaceutical drug}}
A ''medication'' or ''medicine'' is a drug taken to cure and/or ameliorate any symptoms of an [[illness]] or medical condition, or may be used as [[preventive medicine]] that has future benefits but does not treat any existing or pre-existing diseases or symptoms.

Dispensing of medication is often regulated by [[government]]s into three categories—''[[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]]'' (OTC) medications, which are available in [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] and supermarkets without special restrictions, ''[[behind-the-counter]]'' (BTC), which are dispensed by a [[pharmacist]] without needing a doctor's prescription, and ''[[prescription medication|prescription only medicine]]s'' (POM), which must be prescribed by a licensed [[medical professional]], usually a [[physician]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the United Kingdom, BTC medicines are called [[pharmacy medicine]]s which can only be sold in registered pharmacies, by or under the supervision of a pharmacist. These medications are designated by the letter P on the label.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mhra.gov.uk/SearchHelp/Glossary/GlossaryP| title = Glossary of MHRA terms - P| publisher = [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]]| accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref> The range of medicines available without a prescription varies from country to country.

Medications are typically produced by pharmaceutical companies and are often [[patent]]ed to give the developer exclusive rights to produce them. Those that are not patented (or with expired patents) are called [[generic drug]]s since they can be produced by other companies without restrictions or licenses from the patent holder.

== Spiritual and religious use ==
{{Main|Entheogen}}
The spiritual and religious use of drugs has been occurring since the dawn of our species. Drugs that are considered to have spiritual or religious use are called entheogens. Some religions are based completely on the use of certain drugs. Entheogens are mostly [[hallucinogen]]s, being either [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] or [[deliriant]]s, but some are also [[stimulant]]s and [[sedative]]s.

== Self-improvement ==
{{Main|Nootropic}}
Nootropics, also commonly referred to as "smart drugs", are drugs that are claimed to improve human cognitive abilities. Nootropics are used to improve memory, concentration, thought, mood, learning, and many other things. Some nootropics are now beginning to be used to treat certain diseases such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. They are also commonly used to regain brain function lost during aging. Similarly, drugs such as [[steroids]] improve human physical capabilities and are sometimes used (legally or not) for this purpose, often by professional athletes.

== Recreational drug use ==
[[Image:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|The [[cigarette]] is the common pharmaceutical form of [[tobacco]] – one of the world’s best selling drugs.<ref>According to the [http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 statistic] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] the production quantity in 2006 of coffee was 7.8 million tonnes and of tobacco was 6.7 million tonnes.</ref>]]

{{Main|Recreational drug use}}
{{Further|Prohibition of drugs}}
Recreational drugs use is the use of psychoactive substances to have fun, for the experience, or to enhance an already positive experience. National laws prohibit the use of many different recreational drugs and medicinal drugs that have the potential for recreational use are heavily regulated. Many other recreational drugs on the other hand are legal, widely culturally accepted, and at the most have an age restriction on using and/or purchasing them. These include alcohol, tobacco, betel nut, and caffeine products in the west, and in other localised areas of the world drugs such as Khat are common. Because of the legal status of many drugs, recreational drug use is controversial, with many governments not recognising spiritual or other perceived uses for drugs and classing them under illegal recreational use.

==Administering drugs==
Drugs, both medicinal and recreational, can be administered in a number of ways. Many drugs can be administered in a variety of ways rather than just one.
*[[Bolus (medicine)|Bolus]]
*[[Inhalation|Inhaled]], (breathed into the lungs), as an [[aerosol]] or dry powder. (This includes smoking a substance)
*[[Injection (medicine)|Injected]] as a solution, suspension or emulsion either: [[intramuscular]], [[intravenous]], [[intraperitoneal]], [[intraosseous]].
*[[Insufflation (medicine)|Insufflation]], or snorted into the nose.
*[[Mouth|Oral]]ly, as a liquid or solid, that is absorbed through the [[intestine]]s.
*[[Rectum|Rectally]] as a [[suppository]], that is absorbed by the rectum or colon.
*[[Sublingual administration|Sublingually]], diffusing into the blood through tissues under the tongue.
*[[Topical]]ly, usually as a [[cream]] or [[ointment]]. A drug administered in this manner may be given to act locally or systemically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/the-administration-of-medicine/288560.article |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
*Vaginally as a [[suppository]], primarily to treat vaginal infections.
