'''Hypervitaminosis D''' is a state of [[vitamin D]] toxicity.

== Symptoms and presentation ==

Symptoms of vitamin D poisoning include:

* [[Dehydration]]
* [[Vomiting]]
* Decreased [[appetite]]
* [[Irritability]]
* [[Constipation]]
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Muscle weakness]]

An excess of vitamin D causes abnormally high [[blood]] concentrations of [[calcium]] ([[hypercalcemia]]), which can cause overcalcification of the [[bone]]s, [[soft tissue]]s, [[heart]] and [[kidneys]]. It can also damage the kidney and produce [[kidney stones]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.  In addition, [[hypertension]] can result.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dionne J |title=Hypertension in infancy: diagnosis, management, and outcome |journal=Pediatr Nephrol |volume=27 |pages=17–32 |year=2012 |doi= 10.1007/s00467-010-1755-z |pmid=21258818}}</ref> Ongoing research indicates antagonism with oil soluble [[menatetrenone]],  MK-4, an internally transported natural form of [[vitamin K2|vitamin K<sub>2</sub>]], which is associated with bone formation and calcium retention in the bones. 

Hypervitaminosis D symptoms appear several months after excessive doses of vitamin D are administered. In almost every case, a low calcium diet combined with [[corticosteroid]] drugs will allow for a full recovery within a month.

==Loading dose ("stoss treatment")==

A single oral dose of 600,000 IU of [[cholecalciferol]] rapidly increases levels of [[calcifediol]], or 25-deoxy-cholecalciferol [25(OH)D], and reduces levels of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) in young people with vitamin D deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 20660032 | doi=10.1210/jc.2010-0502 | volume=95 | issue=10 | title=Effect of a single oral dose of 600,000 IU of cholecalciferol on serum calciotropic hormones in young subjects with vitamin D deficiency: a prospective intervention study | year=2010 | month=October | author=Cipriani C, Romagnoli E, Scillitani A, ''et al.'' | journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | pages=4771–7}}</ref>

A cholecalciferol [[loading dose]] guideline for vitamin D-deficient adults has been developed.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 20139241 | doi=10.1530/EJE-09-0932 | volume=162 | issue=4 | title=Cholecalciferol loading dose guideline for vitamin D-deficient adults | year=2010 | month=April | author=van Groningen L, Opdenoordt S, van Sorge A, Telting D, Giesen A, de Boer H | journal=Eur. J. Endocrinol. | pages=805–11}}</ref>

==Recommended supplement limits==
The U.S [[Institute of Medicine]] has established a Tolerable Upper Level of Intake (UL) to protect against vitamin D toxicity. These levels in [[micrograms]] (µg) and [[International Units]] (IU) for male and female are:<br>
(Conversion : 1&nbsp;µg = 40 [[International unit|IU]] and 0.025&nbsp;µg = 1 IU.<ref name=HC>{{cite web|url =http://dietarysupplementdatabase.usda.nih.gov/ingredient_calculator/help.php#q9|title = Dietary Reference Intakes Tables [Health Canada, 2005]|accessdate = 21 July 2011}}</ref>)
* 0–6 months: 25&nbsp;µg (1000 IU)
* 7–12 months: 38&nbsp;µg (1500 IU)
* 1–3 years: 63&nbsp;µg (2500 IU)
* 4–8 years:75&nbsp;µg (3000 IU)
* 9+ years:100&nbsp;µg (4000 IU)
* Pregnant and Lactating: 100&nbsp;µg (4000 IU)

The [[Reference Daily Intake|recommended daily allowance]] is 15&nbsp;µg/d (600&nbsp;IU per day). Overdose has been observed at 1,925&nbsp;µg/d (77,000 IU per day).  Acute overdose requires between 15,000&nbsp;µg/d (600,000 IU per day) and 42,000&nbsp;µg/d (1,680,000 IU per day) over a period of several days to months, with a safe intake level being 250&nbsp;µg/d (10,000 IU per day).<ref name="pmid17209171">{{cite journal |author=Hathcock JN, Shao A, Vieth R, Heaney R |title=Risk assessment for vitamin D |journal=Am.

Bone Miner. Res. | pages=V64–8}}</ref>

==Long term effects of supplementary oral intake==
Excessive exposure to sunlight poses no risk in vitamin D toxicity through overproduction of vitamin D precursor, [[cholecalciferol]], regulating vitamin D production. During [[ultraviolet]] exposure, the concentration of vitamin D precursors produced in the skin reach an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], and any further vitamin D that is produced is degraded.<ref name="Holick M 1995 638S–645S">{{cite journal |pmid=7879731 |year=1995 |last1=Holick |first1=MF |title=Environmental factors that influence the cutaneous production of vitamin D. |volume=61 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=638S–645S |journal=Am.

Vitamin D oral supplementation and skin synthesis have a different effect on the transport form of vitamin D, plasma [[calcifediol]] concentrations. Endogenously synthesized vitamin D<sub>3</sub> travels mainly with [[vitamin D-binding protein]], which slows hepatic delivery of vitamin D and the availability in the plasma.<ref name="pmid8390483">{{cite journal |pmid=8390483 |year=1993 |last1=Haddad |first1=JG |last2=Matsuoka |first2=LY |last3=Hollis |first3=BW |last4=Hu |first4=YZ |last5=Wortsman |first5=J |title=Human plasma transport of vitamin D after its endogenous synthesis. |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=2552–5 |doi=10.1172/JCI116492 |pmc=443317 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation}}</ref>

It has been questioned whether to ascribe a state of sub-optimal vitamin D status when the annual variation in ultraviolet will naturally produce a period of falling levels, and such a seasonal decline has been a part of Europeans' adaptive environment for 1000 generations.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-9-22 |title=Seasonal variance of 25-(OH) vitamin D in the general population of Estonia, a Northern European country |year=2009 |last1=Kull |first1=Mart |last2=Kallikorm |first2=Riina |last3=Tamm |first3=Anu |last4=Lember |first4=Margus |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=9 |pages=22 |pmid=19152676 |pmc=2632995}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0903446106 |title=Out of Africa: Modern Human Origins Special Feature: The spread of modern humans in Europe |year=2009 |last1=Hoffecker |first1=J.

Current theories of the mechanism behind vitamin D toxicity propose that:
* Intake of vitamin D raises calcitriol concentrations in the plasma and cell
* Intake of vitamin D raises plasma calcifediol concentrations which exceed the binding capacity of the DBP, and free calcifediol enters the cell
* Intake of vitamin D raises the concentration of vitamin D metabolites which exceed DBP binding capacity and free calcitriol enters the cell
All in which affect gene transcription and overwhelm the vitamin D signal transduction process, leading to vitamin D toxicity.<ref name=pmid18689406>{{cite journal |pmid=18689406 |year=2008 |last1=Jones |first1=G |title=Pharmacokinetics of vitamin D toxicity |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=582S–586S |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref>

A Toronto study of young Canadians of diverse ancestry applied a standard of serum 25(OH)D levels that was significantly higher than official recommendations.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-336 |title=Low wintertime vitamin D levels in a sample of healthy young adults of diverse ancestry living in the Toronto area: associations with vitamin D intake and skin pigmentation |year=2008 |last1=Gozdzik |first1=Agnes |last2=Barta |first2=Jodi |last3=Wu |first3=Hongyu |last4=Wagner |first4=Dennis |last5=Cole |first5=David E |last6=Vieth |first6=Reinhold |last7=Whiting |first7=Susan |last8=Parra |first8=Esteban J |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |pages=336 |pmid=18817578 |pmc=2576234}}</ref><ref>Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (2007) Update on Vitamin D Position Statement by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition 2007 ISBN 978-0-11-243114-5</ref> These levels were described to be 75 nmol/L as "optimal", between 75 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L as "insufficient" and < 50 nmol/L as "deficient". 22% of individuals of European ancestry had 25(OH)D levels less than the 40 nmol/L cutoff, comparable to the values observed in previous studies. 78% of individuals of East Asian ancestry and 77% of individuals of South Asian ancestry had 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 40 nmol/L. The East Asians in the Toronto sample had low 25(OH)D levels when compared to whites. 
Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in China and occurred in more than 40% of adolescent girls in winter.<ref name="pmid20197091"/> In a Chinese population at particular risk for [[esophageal cancer]] and with the high serum 25(OH)D concentrations have a significantly increased risk of the precursor lesion.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Studies on the South Asians population uniformly point to low 25(OH)D levels, despite abundant sunshine.<ref>Harinarayan Vitamin D Status in India&nbsp;– Its Implications and Remedial Measures (2009) [cite http://www.japi.org/january_2009/R-1.html]a review of over 50 studies of 25(OH)D</ref> Rural men around Delhi average 44nmol/L. Healthy Indians seem have low 25(OH)D levels which are not very different from healthy South Asians living in Canada. South Indian patients with ischemic heart disease have serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels which are above 222.5 nmol/l and considered extremely high.<ref name="pmid11949730"/> Measuring melanin content to assess skin pigmentation showed an inverse relationship with serum 25(OH)D.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The uniform occurrence of very low serum 25(OH)D in Indians living in India and Chinese in China does not support the hypothesis that the low levels seen in the more pigmented are due to lack of synthesis from the sun at higher latitudes. 
A study of French Canadians found that a significant minority did not maximize ingested serum 25(OH)D for genetic reasons; vitamin D-binding protein polymorphisms explained as much of the variation in circulating 25(OH)D as did total ingestion of vitamin D.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26445 |title=Genetic polymorphisms of the vitamin D binding protein and plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in premenopausal women |year=2009 |last1=Sinotte |first1=M. |last2=Diorio |first2=C. |last3=Berube |first3=S. |last4=Pollak |first4=M. |last5=Brisson |first5=J. |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=89 |pages=634–40 |pmid=19116321 |issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8751865 |year=1996 |last1=Labuda |first1=M |last2=Labuda |first2=D |last3=Korab-Laskowska |first3=M |last4=Cole |first4=DE |last5=Zietkiewicz |first5=E |last6=Weissenbach |first6=J |last7=Popowska |first7=E |last8=Pronicka |first8=E |last9=Root |first9=AW |title=Linkage disequilibrium analysis in young populations: pseudo-vitamin D-deficiency rickets and the founder effect in French Canadians. |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=633–43 |pmc=1914903 |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}</ref>

===Premature aging===

Complex regulatory mechanisms control metabolism. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that there is a narrow range of vitamin D levels in which vascular function is optimized. Levels above or below this natural [[human homeostasis|homeostasis]] of vitamin D increase mortality.<ref name="pmid18562594"/> Overall, excess or deficiency in the calcipherol system appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tuohimaa P |title=Vitamin D and aging |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=114 |issue=1-2 |pages=78–84 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19444937 |doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.12.020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Keisala T, Minasyan A, Lou YR, ''et al.'' |title=Premature aging in vitamin D receptor mutant mice |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=115 |issue=3-5 |pages=91–7 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19500727 |doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.03.007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tuohimaa P, Keisala T, Minasyan A, Cachat J, Kalueff A |title=Vitamin D, nervous system and aging |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=34 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S278–86 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19660871 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.07.003}}</ref>
