'''''Helicobacter pylori''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɛ|l|ɪ|k|ɵ|ˈ|b|æ|k|t|ər|_|p|aɪ|ˈ|l|ɔər|aɪ}}; '''''H. pylori'''''), previously named '''''Campylobacter pyloridis''''', is a [[Gram-negative]], [[microaerophile|microaerophilic]] [[bacterium]] found in the [[stomach]]. It was identified in 1982 by [[Barry Marshall]] and [[Robin Warren]], who found that it was present in patients with chronic [[gastritis]] and [[Peptic ulcer|gastric ulcers]], conditions that were not previously believed to have a [[Microorganism|microbial]] cause. It is also linked to the development of [[duodenum|duodenal]] ulcers and [[stomach cancer]]. However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are [[asymptomatic]] and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.<ref>{{Cite journal

More than 50% of the world's population harbor ''H. pylori'' in their upper [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Infection is more prevalent in developing countries, and incidence is decreasing in Western countries. ''H. pylori'''s helix shape (from which the [[genus|generic]] name is derived) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the [[mucus|mucoid]] lining of the stomach.<ref name= YamaokaY>{{cite book

Inflammatory processes of ''H. pylori'' infections are also mediated by highly disulfide-bridged proteins. Helicobacter cysteine-rich proteins (Hcp), particularly HcpA (hp0211), triggers an immune response through the differentiation of human [[myeloid]] Thp1 [[monocytes]] into [[macrophages]]. In analogy to [[eukaryotic]] [[cytokines]], they interfere with host cell functions and change the morphology of monocytes, inducing the expression of the surface marker protein CD11b, [[phagocytic]] activity, as well as cell adherence, which are indicative of monocyte differentiation into macrophages.<ref name="pmid19393649">{{cite journal

===Vaccines===
Vaccines against ''H. pylori'' could be used as prophylactic vaccines to prevent the infection or as therapeutic vaccines to cure the infection, to improve the eradication success of standard regimens or to reduce the bacterial density in the gastric mucosa and the risk for emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. In recent years, many attempts, using various ''H. pylori'' antigens such as urease, CagA, HP-NAP, HspA or combinations, many adjuvants and different routes of immunisation have been made to create vaccines against ''H. pylori'' infection. Although some attempts are promising, no effective and safe vaccine against ''H. pylori'' is currently available for humans. New directions for immunization with the use of DNA, living vectors, microspheres etc. are currently under evaluation. The vaccination plan and the groups who should receive vaccination are still to be determined, but the vaccination will be useful, especially in developing countries.<ref name="BoyanovaL"/> An [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] vaccine against ''H. pylori'' infection is undergoing [[Phase I trial|Phase I clinical trials]], and has shown an antibody response against the bacterium. Its clinical usefulness requires further study.<ref>{{cite journal

[[File:Ulcer-causing Bacterium (H.Pylori) Crossing Mucus Layer of Stomach.jpg|thumbnail|left|Diagram showing how the h.pylori reaches the epithelium of the stomach.]]
''H. pylori'' colonizes the stomach and induces chronic [[gastritis]], a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach. The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people. Most individuals infected by ''H. pylori'' will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis. Approximately 10–20% of those colonized by ''H. pylori'' will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers.<ref name="Kusters2006"/> ''H. pylori'' infection is also associated with a 1–2% lifetime risk of [[gastric carcinoma|stomach cancer]] and a less than 1% risk of gastric [[MALT lymphoma]].<ref name="Kusters2006"/> 

In the absence of treatment, ''H. pylori'' infection—once established in its gastric niche—is widely believed to persist for life.<ref name="Brown"/> In the elderly, however, it is likely infection can disappear as the stomach's mucosa becomes increasingly [[Atrophy|atrophic]] and inhospitable to colonization. The proportion of acute infections that persist is not known, but several studies that followed the natural history in populations have reported apparent spontaneous elimination.<ref name=Goodman_2005>{{cite journal

For each of these pathogens, surviving the DNA damage induced by oxidative stress appears to be supported by transformation-mediated recombinational repair.  Thus, transformation and recombinational repair appear to contribute to successful infection.

As summarized in [[Transformation (genetics)]], transformation (the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium) appears to be part of an adaptation for DNA repair.  ''H. pylori'' is naturally competent for transformation.  While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions, such as starvation, ''H. pylori'' is competent throughout logarithmic growth.<ref name=Dorer>{{cite journal |author=Dorer MS, Fero J, Salama NR |title=DNA damage triggers genetic exchange in ''Helicobacter pylori'' |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001026 |year=2010 |pmid=20686662 |pmc=2912397 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001026 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001026 |editor1-last=Blanke |editor1-first=Steven R}}</ref>  As pointed out by Dorer et al.,<ref name=Dorer /> all organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage. In ''H. pylori'', homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The AddAB helicase-nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single strand DNA (ssDNA), which then mediates strand exchange, leading to homologous recombination and repair. The requirement of RecA plus AddAB for efficient gastric colonization suggests that in the stomach ''H. pylori'' is either exposed to double strand DNA damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination-mediated event.  In particular, natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in ''H. pylori'', and Dorer et al.<ref name=Dorer /> found a connection between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in ''H. pylori'', suggesting that natural competence contributes to persistence of ''H. pylori'' in its human host and explains the retention of competence in most clinical isolates.

RuvC protein is essential to the process of recombinational repair since it resolves intermediates in this process termed Holliday junctions.  ''H. pylori'' mutants that are defective in ruvC have increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and to oxidative stress, exhibit reduced survival within macrophages, and are unable to establish successful infection in a mouse model.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loughlin MF, Barnard FM, Jenkins D, Sharples GJ, Jenks PJ |title=''Helicobacter pylori'' mutants defective in RuvC Holliday junction resolvase display reduced macrophage survival and spontaneous clearance from the murine gastric mucosa |journal=Infect.

''Helicobacter pylori'' migrated out of Africa along with its human host circa 60,000 years ago.<ref name=Correa2012>{{cite journal |author=Correa P, Piazuelo MB |title=Evolutionary History of the ''Helicobacter pylori'' Genome: Implications for Gastric Carcinogenesis |journal=Gut Liver |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=21–8 |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=22375167 |pmc=3286735 |doi=10.5009/gnl.2012.6.1.21 |url=http://gutnliver.org/journal/journal_view.html?year=2012&vol=006&num=01&page=21}}
</ref> Its subsequent evolution created seven prototypes—Europe (isolated from Europe, the Middle East, India and Iran), NE Africa (from Northeast Africa), Africa1 (from countries in Western Africa and South Africa), Africa2 (from South Africa), Asia2 (from Northern India and among isolates from Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia), Sahul (from Australian Aboriginals and Papua New Guineans) and East Asia with the subpopulations E Asia (from East Asians), Maori (from Taiwanese Aboriginals, Melanesians and Polynesians) and Amerind (Native Americans). The precursors of these prototypes have been named ancestral Europe1, ancestral Europe2, ancestral East Asia, ancestral Africa1, ancestral Africa2 and ancestral Sahul. These ancestral prototypes appear to have originated in Africa, Central and East Asia.  European and African strains were introduced into the Americas along with its colonisation—both thousands of years ago and more recently— the slave trade.

Recent research states that [[genetic diversity]] in ''H. pylori'' increases with geographic distance from [[Eastern Africa|East Africa]], the birthplace of modern humans. Using the genetic diversity data, the researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seem to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago. Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by ''H. pylori'' before their migrations out of Africa, and it has remained associated with human hosts since that time.<ref>{{cite journal

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori}}
''Helicobacter pylori'' was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and stomach ulcers in 1982 by Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. [[Robin Warren]] of [[Perth, Western Australia]]. At the time, the conventional thinking was that no bacterium can live in the human stomach, as the stomach produced extensive amounts of acid of a strength similar to the acid found in a [[car battery]]. Marshall and Warren rewrote the textbooks with reference to what causes gastritis and gastric ulcers.
In recognition of their discovery, they were awarded the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web

Previous to the research of Marshall and Warren, German scientists found spiral-shaped [[bacteria]] in the lining of the human stomach in 1875, but they were unable to [[Microbiological culture|culture]] it, and the results were eventually forgotten.<ref name=Blaser_2005>{{cite journal
