'''Piblokto''', also known as  '''pibloktoq''' and '''Arctic hysteria''', is a condition most commonly appearing in [[Inughuit]] societies living within the [[Arctic Circle]]. A piblokto attack is most often characterized as a dissociative state of sudden onset including symptoms such as hysterical seizures and paralysis of limbs with a loss of consciousness during the attack and amnesia afterwards. Appearing most prevalently in winter,<ref>Taylor, S., Shelor, N., & Abdelnour, M. (1972). Nutritional ecology: a new perspective. http://soar.wichita.edu/xmlui//handle/10057/1641</ref> it is considered to be a form of a [[culture-bound syndrome]], although more recent studies (see ''Skepticism'' section) question whether it exists at all.


==Origin==
Piblokto is most often found but not confined to the Inughuit cultures in the polar regions of Northern Greenland. Symptoms can include intense [[hysteria]] (screaming, uncontrolled wild behavior) of up to 30 minutes duration,<ref>Lister, J. (1989). Two Perspectives on the etiology of pibloktoq. Retrieved April 1,2013 from http://soar.wichita.edu/handle/10057/1813 </ref> [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[coprophagia]], insensitivity to extreme cold (such as running around in the snow naked), [[echolalia]] (senseless repetition of overheard words) and more. Similar symptoms have been reported in European sailors stranded in arctic regions in the 1800s. Among inughuits, the attacks are not considered out of the ordinary. No native theory of the disorder is currently reported.  This condition is most often seen in Inughuit women.<ref>Ruiz, P. (2007). Focusing on culture and ethnicity in america. Retrieved from http://www.sequeltsi.com/files/library/Understanding_Cultural_Identity.pdf</ref> This culture-bound syndrome is possibly linked to [[vitamin A]] toxicity ([[hypervitaminosis A]]).<ref>Kontaxakis, V., Skourides, D., Ferentinos, P., Havaki-Kontaxaki, B., & Papadimitriou, G. (2009). Isotretinoid and psychopathology: a review. Annals of General Psychiatry, 8(2), doi: 10.1186/1744-859X-8-2</ref><ref>Smith, S. (2012, December 6) What is Piblokto? Retrieved March 29,2013 from wisegeek[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-piblokto.htm]</ref>  The native Inughuit diet provides rich sources of vitamin A and is possibly the cause or a causative factor. The ingestion of [[offal|organ meat]]s, particularly the livers of arctic fish and mammals, where the vitamin is stored in toxic quantities, can be fatal to most people.

==Skepticism==
In 1988, [[Parks Canada]] historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the Arctic explorers, and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word "piblokto" / "pibloktoq" does not exist within the Inughuit language; possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in phonetic transcription. It was also common for European explorers to mishear native words, or to transcribe them poorly. In an era when spelling of English words was still wildly inconsistent, people attempting to transcribe words in foreign languages often came up with some very creative variations. There are several Inuit words similar to “piblokto” which describe various states of mental distress, and it may be that these words were used and explorers misunderstood them. Some Canadian historians who have researched piblokto have suggested that in fact what explorers viewed as “madness” might have been a stress reaction. European explorers greatly stressed the communities they interacted with, especially when they took members of the native population along to use as guides and assistants. It is possible that the behavior observed and reported by some explorers was indeed aberrant, but it had less to do with the harsh conditions of the Arctic than it did with the conditions encountered among groups of explorers. <ref>http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-piblokto.htm</ref>


In a 1995 paper published in the journal ''Arctic Anthropology'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=L|title="Pibloktoq"(Arctic Hysteria): A construction of European-Inuit relations.|journal=Arctic Anthropology|year=1995|month=February|volume=32|issue=2|pages=2|url=http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?hid=23&sid=fcfa52f5-9576-463b-9e9c-52ae709b9f3a%40sessionmgr15&vid=3&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=9512292521|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> and in his 2001 book ''Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the age of contact'', Dick suggests that piblokto is a "phantom phenomenon", arising more from the [[culture shock|Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst]].<ref>[http://www.sarahefron.com/stories/arctichysteria.shtml "Arctic Hysteria"], from [http://www.uphere.ca Up Here Magazine], by Sarah Ephron, July/August 2003; archived at SarahEfron.com</ref>

Similarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a "catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to patriarchy or sexual coercion, and shamanistic practice."<ref> Simons, R.
