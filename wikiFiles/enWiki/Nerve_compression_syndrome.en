'''Nerve compression syndrome''' or '''compression neuropathy''', also known as '''entrapment neuropathy''', is a [[medical condition]] caused by direct pressure on a single [[nerve]]. It is known colloquially as a ''trapped nerve'', though this may also refer to [[nerve root]] compression (by a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]], for example). Its symptoms include [[pain]], [[Paraesthesia|tingling]], [[numbness]], and [[muscle weakness]]. The symptoms affect just one particular part of the body, depending which nerve is affected. [[Nerve conduction studies]] help to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, [[surgery]] may help to relieve the pressure on the nerve, but this does not always relieve all the symptoms.

[[Nerve injury]] by a single episode of [[physical trauma]] is in one sense a compression neuropathy, but is not usually included under this heading.

==Pathophysiology==
External pressure reduces flow in the vessels supplying the nerve with blood (the [[vasa nervorum]]). This causes local [[ischaemia]], which has an immediate effect on the ability of the nerve [[axons]] to transmit [[action potentials]]. As the compression becomes more severe over time, focal [[demyelination]] occurs, followed by axonal damage, and finally [[Fibrosis|scarring]].

==Causes==
A nerve may be compressed by prolonged or repeated external force, such as sitting with one's arm over the back of a chair ([[radial nerve]]), frequently resting one's elbows on a table ([[ulnar nerve]]), or an ill-fitting cast or brace on the leg ([[peroneal nerve]]).

Part of the patient's own body can cause the compression, and the term ''entrapment neuropathy'' is used particularly in this situation. The offending structure may be a well-defined lesion such as a [[tumour]] (for example a [[lipoma]], [[neurofibroma]] or [[metastasis]]), a [[ganglion cyst]] or a [[haematoma]]. Alternatively, there may be expansion of the tissues around a nerve in a space where there is little room for this to occur, as is often the case in [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]. This may be due to [[weight gain]] or [[peripheral oedema]] (especially in [[pregnancy]]), or to a specific condition such as [[acromegaly]], [[hypothyroidism]] or [[scleroderma]].

Some conditions cause nerves to be particularly susceptible to compression. These include [[diabetes]], in which the blood supply to the nerves is already compromised, rendering the nerve more sensitive to minor degrees of compression. The genetic condition [[Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies|HNPP]] is a much rarer cause.

The causes of each particular syndrome are discussed on the relevant pages, listed [[#List_of_syndromes|below]].

==Diagnosis==
The [[symptoms]] and [[Medical sign|signs]] depend on which nerve is affected, where along its length the nerve is affected, and how severely the nerve is affected. Positive sensory symptoms are usually the earliest to occur, particularly [[Paraesthesia|tingling]] and [[Neuropathy#Neuropathic_pain|neuropathic pain]], followed or accompanied by reduced sensation or complete numbness. [[Muscle weakness]] is usually noticed later, and is often associated with [[muscle atrophy]].

A compression neuropathy can usually be diagnosed confidently on the basis of the symptoms and signs alone. However, [[nerve conduction studies]] are helpful in confirming the diagnosis, quantifying the severity, and ruling out involvement of other nerves (suggesting a [[mononeuritis multiplex]] or [[polyneuropathy]]). A [[Radiology|scan]] is not usually necessary, but may be helpful if a tumour or other local compressive lesion is suspected.

Nerve injury, as a [[mononeuropathy]], may cause similar symptoms to compression neuropathy. This may occasionally cause diagnostic confusion, particularly if the patient does not remember the injury and there are no obvious physical signs to suggest it.

The symptoms and signs of each particular syndrome are discussed on the relevant pages, listed [[#List_of_syndromes|below]].

==Treatment==
When an underlying medical condition is causing the neuropathy, treatment should first be directed at this condition. For example, if weight gain is the underlying cause, then a weight loss program is the most appropriate treatment. Compression neuropathy occurring in pregnancy often resolves after delivery, so no specific treatment is usually required.

Some compression neuropathies are amenable to [[surgery]]: [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and [[cubital tunnel syndrome]] are two common examples. Whether or not it is appropriate to offer surgery in any particular case depends on the severity of the symptoms, the risks of the proposed operation, and the [[prognosis]] if untreated. After surgery, the symptoms may resolve completely, but if the compression was sufficiently severe or prolonged then the nerve may not recover fully and some symptoms may persist.

Drug treatment may be useful for an underlying condition (including [[peripheral oedema]]), or for ameliorating [[Neuropathy#Neuropathic_pain|neuropathic pain]].
