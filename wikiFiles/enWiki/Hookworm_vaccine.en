'''Hookworm vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] against [[hookworm]].<ref name=pmid18171264>{{cite journal |author=Diemert DJ, Bethony JM, Hotez PJ |title=Hookworm vaccines |journal=Clin. Infect.

Hookworms, parasitic [[nematode]]s transmitted in soil, infect approximately 700 million humans, particularly in [[tropical]] regions of the world where endemic hookworms include ''[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]'' and ''[[Necator americanus]]''. Hookworms feed on [[blood]] and those infected with hookworms may suffer from chronic [[anaemia]] and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=pmid18171264/><ref name=pmid16187734>{{cite journal |author=Devaney E |title=The End of the Line for Hookworm?

==Mechanism of action==
Hookworm infections in humans can last for several years, and re-infection can occur very shortly after treatment, suggesting that hookworms effectively evade&mdash;and may interfere or modulate&mdash;the host [[immune system]].<ref name=pmid18171264/> While this would suggest that vaccine development may be difficult, successful hookworm vaccines have been developed for several animal species.<ref name=pmid18171264/> On the basis of prior work, human vaccine development has targeted [[antigen]]s from both the larval and adult stages of the hookworm life cycle; a combined vaccine for humans that would provide more complete protection against hookworm infection.<ref name=pmid18171264/> Current targets of larval proteins have been demonstrated to attenuate larval migration through host tissue; targets of adult proteins have been demonstrated to block [[enzyme]]s vital to hookworm feeding.

Examples of antigenic targets of hookworm vaccines currently being investigated in [[clinical trial]]s include ''Na''-ASP-2 from ''N. americanus'' and ''Ac''-APR-1 from ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]''.

The function of ''Na''-ASP-2 is not currently known (though it may function as a [[chemotaxin]] mimic<ref name=pmid18171264/>), but it is a [[cysteine-rich secretory protein]] that is released during parasite entry into the host and may have some function in the transition from the larval environment stage of the hookworm life-cycle to an adult parasitic existence.<ref name=pmid16187734/><ref name="pmid17012856">{{cite journal |author=Fujiwara RT, Bethony J, Bueno LL, ''et al.'' |title=Immunogenicity of the hookworm Na-ASP-2 vaccine candidate: characterization of humoral and cellular responses after vaccination in the Sprague Dawley rat |journal=Hum Vaccin |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=123–8 |year=2005 |pmid=17012856 |doi= 10.4161/hv.1.3.1924|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/hv/abstract.php?id=1924}}</ref><ref name="pmid18396361">{{cite journal |author=Bethony JM, Simon G, Diemert DJ, ''et al.'' |title=Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the Na-ASP-2 hookworm vaccine in unexposed adults |journal=Vaccine |volume=26 |issue=19 |pages=2408–17 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18396361 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.02.049 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264-410X(08)00242-9}}</ref><ref name=pmid16054275>{{cite journal |author=Goud GN, Bottazzi ME, Zhan B, ''et al.'' |title=Expression of the Necator americanus hookworm larval antigen Na-ASP-2 in Pichia pastoris and purification of the recombinant protein for use in human clinical trials |journal=Vaccine |volume=23 |issue=39 |pages=4754–64 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16054275 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.04.040 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264-410X(05)00511-6}}</ref> The class of proteins that includes ''Na''-ASP-2, ASPs, are promising vaccine candidates based on previous vaccine studies in sheep, guinea pigs, cattle, and mice, which have demonstrated inhibition of hookworm larval migration.

''Ac''-APR-1 is an [[aspartic protease]], specifically a hemoglobinase, that participates in the hookworm's digestion of [[hemoglobin]] from its blood meal<ref name=pmid16231975/> and is present in the adult stage of the hookworm life cycle.<ref name=pmid18171264/><ref name=pmid16231975>{{cite journal |author=Loukas A, Bethony JM, Mendez S, ''et al.'' |title=Vaccination with Recombinant Aspartic Hemoglobinase Reduces Parasite Load and Blood Loss after Hookworm Infection in Dogs |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e295 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16231975 |pmc=1240050 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020295 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020295}}</ref> Animals immunized against ''Ac''-APR-1 exhibited a reduction in worm burden, a reduction in hemoglobin loss, and a dramatic reduction in worm [[fecundity]].<ref name=pmid16187734/>
