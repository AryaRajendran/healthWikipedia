The '''chin curtain beard''' (also called a '''Donegal''' or '''Lincoln''') is a particular style of [[facial hair]] that grows along the [[jaw]] line and covers the [[chin]] completely. This is not to be confused with the [[chinstrap beard]]—a similar style of beard that also grows along the jaw line but does not fully cover the chin. In addition, many chin curtain beards do not extend that far below the jawline, if at all, whereas all chinstrap beards generally do.

This style of facial hair was made famous by individuals such as [[Abraham Lincoln]]. 

In [[Spain]], it could be largely associated with 1970s [[hippy|''progres'']] and other cultural icons, such as writer [[Álvaro Pombo]].
