The '''first branchial arch''', also called the '''first pharyngeal arch''' and '''mandibular arch''', is the first of six [[pharyngeal arch]]es that develops in [[Prenatal_development#Week_4_.2822-28_days_from_fertilization.29|fetal life]] during the fourth week of development.<ref>William J. Larsen (2001). Human embryology. Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone. ISBN 0-443-06583-7</ref>  It is located between the [[stomodeum]] and the [[first pharyngeal groove]].

== Processes ==
This arch divides into a [[maxillary process]] and a [[mandibular process]], giving rise to structures including the [[bone]]s of the lower two-thirds of the face and the jaw.  The maxillary process becomes the maxilla (or '''upper jaw'''), and [[palate]] while the mandibular process becomes the lower jaw. This arch also gives rise to the [[Mastication#Muscles_of_mastication|muscles of mastication]].

==Meckel's cartilage==
[[Meckel's cartilage]] forms in the [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesoderm]] of the mandibular process and eventually regresses to form the [[incus]] and [[malleus]] of the [[middle ear]], the anterior ligament of the malleus and the [[sphenomandibular ligament]]. The [[Human mandible|mandible]] or lower jaw forms by perichondral [[ossification]] using Meckel's cartilage as a 'template', but the mandible does ''not'' arise from direct ossification of Meckel's cartilage.

==Derivatives==
The skeletal elements and muscles are detrived from mesoderm of the pharyngeal arches.

Derivatives of the first arch:

===Skeletal elements===

*[[Malleus]] & [[Incus]] of the middle ear
*[[maxilla]] & [[Human mandible|mandible]]
*[[spine of sphenoid bone]]
*[[Sphenomandibular ligament]]
*[[palatine bone]]
*squamous part of [[temporal bone]]
*[[Anterior ligament of malleus]]

=== Muscles ===

* [[Muscles of mastication]] (chewing)
**[[Masseter]]
** [[medial pterygoid muscle|medial]] & [[lateral pterygoid muscle]]s
**[[Temporalis]] muscles
*[[Mylohyoid muscle]]
*[[Digastric muscle]], anterior belly
*[[Tensor palati muscle]]
*[[Tensor tympani muscle]]

=== Other derivatives ===

[[Mucous membrane]] and glands of the [[anterior two thirds of the tongue]] are derived from [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]] of the arch.

== Nerve supply ==
The mandibular and maxillary branches of the [[trigeminal nerve]] ('''CN V''') innervate the  structures derived from the corresponding processes of the first arch.<ref>Harris, Edward F., 2002.''Craniofacial Growth and Development.''</ref> In some lower animals, each arch is supplied by two cranial nerves.The nerve of the arch itself runs along the cranial side of the arch and is called post-trematic nerve of the arch.Each arch also receives a branch from the nerve of the succeeding arch called the pre-trematic nerve which runs along the caudal border of the arch.In human embryo,a double innervation is seen only in the first pharyngeal arch.The mandibular nerve is the post-trematic nerve of the first arch and [[chorda tympani]] (branch of facial nerve) is the pre-trematic nerve.This double innervation is reflected in the nerve supply of anterior two-thirds of [[Tongue#Innervation|tongue]] which is derived from the first arch.<ref>Inderbir Sing,G.P Pal-Human Embryology</ref>

==Blood supply==
The artery of the first arch is the first aortic arch,<ref>McMinn, R., 1994. ''Last's anatomy: Regional and applied (9th ed).''</ref> which partially persists as the [[maxillary artery]].
