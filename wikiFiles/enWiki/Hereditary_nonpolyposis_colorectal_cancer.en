'''Lynch syndrome''' ('''HNPCC''' or '''Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer''' ) is an [[autosomal dominant]] genetic condition that has a high risk of [[colon cancer]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kastrinos F, Mukherjee B, Tayob N, ''et al.'' |title=Risk of pancreatic cancer in families with Lynch syndrome |journal=JAMA |volume=302 |issue=16 |pages=1790–5 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19861671 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1529 |url=}}</ref> as well as other cancers including [[Endometrial cancer|endometrium]], [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]], [[Stomach cancer|stomach]], [[Gastrointestinal cancer|small intestine]], [[Gallbladder cancer|hepatobiliary tract]], upper [[urinary tract]], [[Brain tumor|brain]], and [[Skin cancer|skin]]. The increased risk for these cancers is due to inherited mutations that impair [[DNA mismatch repair]].  It is a type of [[cancer syndrome]].

==Terminology==
[[Henry T. Lynch]] (professor of medicine at [[Creighton University Medical Center]]),<ref>[http://medicine.creighton.edu/HCC/Welcome%20DrL.htm School of Medicine :: Hereditary Cancer Center :: Creighton University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> characterized the syndrome in 1966.<ref name="pmid5901552">{{cite journal |author=Lynch HT, Shaw MW, Magnuson CW, Larsen AL, Krush AJ |title=Hereditary factors in cancer.

The term "Lynch syndrome" was coined in 1984 by other authors, and Lynch himself coined the term HNPCC in 1985.  Since then, the two terms have been used interchangeably, until more recent advances in the understanding of the genetics of the disease led to the term HNPCC falling out of favour.<ref name=bellizzi>{{cite journal |author=Bellizzi AM, Frankel WL |year=2009 |title=Colorectal cancer due to deficiency in DNA mismatch repair function: a review |journal=Advances in Anatomic Pathology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=405–417 |pmid=19851131 |doi=10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181bb6bdc}}</ref>

==Classification==
Three major groups of MSI-H ([[Microsatellite instability|MSI]], [[Microsatellite instability|MicroSatellite Instability]]) cancers can be recognized by histopathological criteria: 
* (1) right-sided poorly differentiated cancers
* (2) right-sided mucinous cancers
* (3) [[adenocarcinomas]] in any location showing any measurable level of [[intraepithelial lymphocyte]] (TIL)

In addition, HNPCC can be divided into ''Lynch syndrome I'' (familial colon cancer) and ''Lynch syndrome II'' (HNPCC associated with other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract or [[reproductive system]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/188613-overview Hereditary Colorectal Cancer > Background]. From Medscape. By Juan Carlos Munoz and Louis R Lambiase. Updated: Oct 31, 2011</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
===Risk of colon cancer===
Individuals with HNPCC have about an 80% lifetime risk for [[colon cancer]]. Two-thirds of these cancers occur in the [[Colon (anatomy)|proximal colon]]. The mean age of [[colorectal cancer]] diagnosis is 44 for members of families that meet the Amsterdam criteria. Also, women with HNPCC have a 80% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer. The average age of diagnosis of endometrial cancer is about 46 years. Among women with HNPCC who have both colon and endometrial cancer, about half present first with [[endometrial cancer]]. In HNPCC, the mean age of diagnosis of [[gastric cancer]] is 56 years of age with intestinal-type [[adenocarcinoma]] being the most commonly reported pathology. HNPCC-associated ovarian cancers have an average age of diagnosis of 42.5 years-old; approximately 30% are diagnosed before age 40 years. Other HNPCC-related cancers have been reported with specific features: the urinary tract cancers are transitional [[carcinoma]] of the ureter and [[renal pelvis]]; [[small bowel]] cancers occur most commonly in the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]; the [[central nervous system]] tumor most often seen is [[glioblastoma]].

==Genetics==
[[Image:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree Chart.svg|thumb|right| HNPCC is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion.]]
HNPCC defects in [[DNA mismatch repair]] lead to [[microsatellite instability]], also known as MSI-H, which is a hallmark of HNPCC. MSI is identifiable in [[cancer]] specimens in the [[pathology]] laboratory.<ref>[http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/910/1/62 Pathology of Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer - JASS 910 (1): 62 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Most cases result in changes in the lengths of [[dinucleotide repeats]] of the [[nucleobase]]s cytosine and adenine (sequence: CACACACACA...).<ref>{{cite pmid|10321739}}</ref>

HNPCC is known to be associated with mutations in [[gene]]s involved in the [[DNA mismatch repair]] pathway

Up to 39% of families with mutations in an HNPCC gene do not meet the [[Amsterdam criteria]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Therefore, families found to have a deleterious mutation in an HNPCC gene should be considered to have HNPCC regardless of the extent of the family history.  This also means that the Amsterdam criteria fail to identify many patients at risk for Lynch syndrome.  Improving the criteria for screening is an active area of research, as detailed in the Screening Strategies section of this article.

HNPCC is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] manner.  Most people with HNPCC inherit the condition from a parent. However, due to incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer diagnosis, cancer risk reduction, or early death, not all patients with an HNPCC gene mutation have a parent who had cancer.  Some patients develop HNPCC de-novo in a new generation, without inheriting the gene.  These patients are often only identified after developing an early-life colon cancer.  Parents with HNPCC have a 50% chance of passing the genetic mutation on to each child.

==Screening==
[[Genetic testing]] for mutations in [[DNA mismatch repair]] genes is expensive and time-consuming, so researchers have proposed techniques for identifying cancer patients who are most likely to be HNPCC carriers as ideal candidates for [[genetic testing]].  The [[Amsterdam Criteria]] (see below) are useful, but do not identify up to 30% of potential Lynch syndrome carriers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  In colon cancer patients, pathologists can measure [[microsatellite instability]] in colon tumor specimens, which is a [[surrogate marker]] for [[DNA mismatch repair]] gene dysfunction.  If there is [[microsatellite instability]] identified, there is a higher likelihood for a Lynch syndrome diagnosis.  Recently, researchers combined [[microsatellite instability]] (MSI) profiling and [[immunohistochemistry]] testing for [[DNA mismatch repair]] gene expression and identified an extra 32% of Lynch syndrome carriers who would have been missed on MSI profiling alone.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Currently, this combined [[immunohistochemistry]] and MSI profiling strategy is the most advanced way of identifying candidates for [[genetic testing]] for the Lynch syndrome.

[[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] are recommended for families that meet the [[Amsterdam criteria]], preferably before the onset of colon cancer.

===Amsterdam criteria===
The following are the Amsterdam criteria in identifying high-risk candidates for molecular genetic testing:<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10348829 | volume=116 | issue=6 | title=New clinical criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome) proposed by the International Collaborative group on HNPCC | year=1999 | month=June | author=Vasen HF, Watson P, Mecklin JP, Lynch HT | journal=Gastroenterology | pages=1453–6 | doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(99)70510-X}}</ref>

''Amsterdam Criteria:'' 
*Three or more family members with a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer, one of whom is a first degree (parent, child, sibling) relative of the other two
*Two successive affected generations
*One or more colon cancers diagnosed under age 50 years
*[[Familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP) has been excluded

''Amsterdam Criteria II'':
*Three or more family members with HNPCC-related cancers, one of whom is a first degree relative of the other two
*Two successive affected generations
*One or more of the HNPCC-related cancers diagnosed under age 50 years
*[[Familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP) has been excluded

==Diagnosis==
The Amsterdam clinical criteria identifies candidates for [[genetic testing]], and [[genetic testing]] can make a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Genetic testing is commercially available and consists of a blood test.

==Treatment==
Surgery remains the front-line therapy for HNPCC.  There is an ongoing controversy over the benefit of [[5-fluorouracil]]-based adjuvant therapies for HNPCC-related colorectal tumours, particularly those in stages I and II.<ref>Boland CR, Koi M, Chang DK, Carethers JM. ''The biochemical basis of microsatellite instability and abnormal immunohistochemistry and clinical behavior in Lynch Syndrome: from bench to bedside.'' Familial Cancer epub 2007; DOI 10.1007/s10689-007-9145-9</ref>

==Prevention==
After reporting a null finding from their randomized controlled trial of [[aspirin]] (ASA) to prevent against the colorectal neoplasia of Lynch Syndrome,<ref name="pmid19073976">{{cite journal |author=Burn J, Bishop DT, Mecklin JP, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of aspirin or resistant starch on colorectal neoplasia in the Lynch syndrome |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=24 |pages=2567–78 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19073976 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801297 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=19073976&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref> Burn and colleagues have recently reported new data, representing a longer follow-up period than reported in the initial NEJM paper. These new data demonstrate a reduced incidence in Lynch Syndrome patients who were exposed to at least four years of high-dose aspirin, with a satisfactory risk profile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/711603 |title=Aspirin Confers Long-Term Protective Effect in Lynch Syndrome Patients |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> These results have been widely covered in the media; future studies will look at modifying (lowering) the dose (to reduce risk associated with the high dosage of ASA). <!-- Advice? Individuals with Lynch Syndrome may wish to discuss the application of these results with their medical care team. -->

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, about 160,000 new cases of [[colorectal cancer]] are diagnosed each year. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is responsible for approximately 2 percent to 7 percent of all diagnosed cases of [[colorectal cancer]]. The average age of diagnosis of cancer in patients with this syndrome is 44 years old, as compared to 64 years old in people without the syndrome.<ref>[http://www.oncolink.org/types/article.cfm?c=5&s=11&ss=81&id=6979 Cancer Information, Research, and Treatment for all Types of Cancer | OncoLink<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
