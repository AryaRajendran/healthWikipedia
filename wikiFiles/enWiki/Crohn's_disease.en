Abdominal pain may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. It is often accompanied by diarrhea, especially in those who have had surgery. The diarrhea may or may not be bloody. The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the part of the small intestine or colon involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume, watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 [[bowel movements]] per day and may need to awaken at night to defecate.<ref name=Baumgart/><ref name=emed/><ref name=Podolsky/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.2002.02173.x |title=Anorectal functional disorders in the absence of anorectal inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease |year=2002 |last1=Mueller |first1=M.

Symptoms caused by [[bowel obstruction|intestinal stenosis]] are also common in Crohn's disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenoses. In the setting of severe stenosis, vomiting and nausea may indicate the beginnings of small bowel obstruction.<ref name=emed>

Perianal discomfort may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the [[anus]] may be suggestive of inflammation, [[fistula|fistulization]] or [[abscess]] around the anal area<ref name=Baumgart/> or [[anal fissure]]. Perianal skin [[acrochordon|tags]] are also common in Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01649703 |title=The histology of anal skin tags in Crohn's disease: An aid to confirmation of the diagnosis |year=1989 |last1=Taylor |first1=B.

At the opposite end of the gastrointestinal tract, the mouth may be affected by non-healing sores ([[aphthous ulcer]]s). Rarely, the [[esophagus]], and [[stomach]] may be involved in Crohn's disease. These can cause symptoms including difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-5107(04)02200-X |title=Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease |year=2004 |last1=Fix |first1=Oren K. |last2=Soto |first2=Jorge A. |last3=Andrews |first3=Charles W. |last4=Farraye |first4=Francis A. |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=985 |pmid=15605018}}</ref>

=== Systemic ===
Crohn's disease, like many other chronic, inflammatory diseases, can cause a variety of [[B symptoms|systemic symptoms]].<ref name=Baumgart/> Among children, [[growth failure]] is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn's disease based on [[failure to thrive|inability to maintain growth]].<ref name=Beattie/> As it may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in [[puberty]], up to 30% of children with Crohn's disease may have retardation of growth.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0300-2977(96)00064-2 |title=Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children |year=1997 |last1=Büller |first1=H |journal=The Netherlands Journal of Medicine |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=S8–11 |pmid=9050326}}</ref> Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5&nbsp;˚C (101.3&nbsp;˚F) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an [[abscess]].<ref name=Baumgart/> Among older individuals, Crohn's disease may manifest as weight loss, usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn's disease often feel better when they do not eat and might lose their appetite.<ref name=Beattie>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.080481 |title=Inflammatory bowel disease |year=2006 |last1=Beattie |first1=R M |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=426–32 |pmid=16632672 |last2=Croft |first2=NM |last3=Fell |first3=JM |last4=Afzal |first4=NA |last5=Heuschkel |first5=RB |pmc=2082730}}</ref> People with extensive [[small intestine]] disease may also have [[malabsorption]] of [[carbohydrate]]s or [[lipid]]s, which can further exacerbate weight loss.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00365529609094750 |title=Nutrition and Gastrointestinal Disease |year=1996 |last1=O'Keefe |first1=S.

=== Extraintestinal ===

[[Image:Crohnie sores 4.JPG|thumb|[[Erythema nodosum]] on the back of a person with Crohn's disease]]

In addition to systemic and gastrointestinal involvement, Crohn's disease can affect many other organ systems.<ref name="Danese">{{cite journal |first1=Silvio |last1=Danese |first2=Stefano |last2=Semeraro |first3=Alfredo |last3=Papa |first4=Italia |last4=Roberto |first5=Franco |last5=Scaldaferri |first6=Giuseppe |last6=Fedeli |first7=Giovanni |last7=Gasbarrini |first8=Antonio |last8=Gasbarrini |year=2005 |title=Extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease |journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=11 |issue=46 |pages=7227–36 |pmid=16437620 |url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/7227.asp}}</ref> Inflammation of the interior portion of the eye, known as [[uveitis]], can cause eye pain, especially when exposed to light ([[photophobia]]). Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye ([[sclera]]), a condition called [[episcleritis]]. Both episcleritis and uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated.

Crohn's disease that affects the ileum may result in an increased risk for [[gallstone]]s. This is due to a decrease in bile acid resorption in the ileum and the bile gets excreted in the stool. As a result, the cholesterol/bile ratio increases in the gallbladder, resulting in an increased risk for gallstones.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmc = 1374640| year = 1994| last1 = Hutchinson| first1 = R| last2 = Tyrrell| first2 = PN| last3 = Kumar| first3 = D| last4 = Dunn| first4 = JA| last5 = Li| first5 = JK| last6 = Allan| first6 = RN| title = Pathogenesis of gall stones in Crohn's disease: An alternative explanation| volume = 35| issue = 1| pages = 94–97| journal = Gut }}</ref>

Crohn's disease is associated with a type of [[Rheumatology|rheumatologic disease]] known as [[spondyloarthropathy|seronegative spondyloarthropathy]]. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more [[joint]]s ([[arthritis]]) or muscle insertions ([[enthesitis]]). The arthritis can affect larger joints, such as the knee or shoulder, or may exclusively involve the small joints of the hands and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to [[ankylosing spondylitis]] if the entire spine is involved or simply [[sacroiliitis]] if only the lower spine is involved. The symptoms of arthritis include painful, warm, swollen, stiff [[Arthralgia|joints]] and loss of joint mobility or function.<ref name="healthline">{{cite web | publisher=Healthline Networks, Inc. | title=Arthritis | url= http://www.healthline.com/channel/arthritis.html | date= October 10, 2008 | accessdate = 2010–08–16}}</ref>

[[Image:Crohnie Pyoderma gangrenosum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pyoderma gangrenosum]] on the leg of a person with Crohn's disease]]

Crohn's disease may also involve the skin, blood, and [[endocrine system]]. One type of skin manifestation, [[erythema nodosum]], presents as red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is characterized by septal [[panniculitis]]. Another skin lesion, [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], is typically a painful ulcerating nodule. Crohn's disease also increases the risk of [[blood clot]]s; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of [[deep venous thrombosis]], while difficulty breathing may be a result of [[pulmonary embolism]]. [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]], a condition in which the immune system attacks the [[red blood cells]], is also more common in Crohn's disease and may cause fatigue, pallor, and other symptoms common in [[anemia]]. [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]], a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn's disease. Finally, Crohn's disease may cause [[osteoporosis]], or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s.<ref name="Bernstein">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.50219.x |title=Maintenance Infliximab Treatment is Associated with Improved Bone Mineral Density in Crohn's Disease |year=2005 |last1=Bernstein |first1=Michael |last2=Irwin |first2=Sue |last3=Greenberg |first3=Gordon R. |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=2031–5 |pmid=16128948}}</ref>

Crohn's disease can also cause neurological complications (reportedly in up to 15% of patients).<ref name="pro">[http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/inflammatory_crohn.html Crohn's disease]. professionals.epilepsy.com. Retrieved July 13, 2007.</ref> The most common of these are [[seizures]], [[stroke]], [[myopathy]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[headache]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="pro" />

Crohn's patients often also have issues with [[small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome]], which has similar symptoms.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000222|Small bowel bacterial overgrowth}}</ref>

In the [[oral cavity]] crohn's patients may suffer from [[cheilitis granulomatosa]] and other forms of [[orofacial granulomatosis]], [[pyostomatitis vegetans]], [[recurrent aphthous stomatitis]], [[geographic tongue]] and [[migratory stomatitis]] in higher prevalence than the general population.<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016 |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |year=2011 |last1=Zadik |first1=Yehuda |last2=Drucker |first2=Scott |last3=Pallmon |first3=Sarit |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |pmid=21763590}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
{{Pathophysiology in CD vs. UC}}
During a [[colonoscopy]], [[Biopsy|biopsies]] of the colon are often taken to confirm the diagnosis. Certain characteristic features of the [[pathology]] seen point toward Crohn's disease; it shows a transmural pattern of [[inflammation]], meaning the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall.<ref name=Baumgart/> [[Peptic ulcer|Ulceration]] is an outcome seen in highly active disease. There is usually an abrupt transition between unaffected tissue and the ulcer - a characteristic sign known as skip lesions. Under a microscope, biopsies of the affected colon may show [[mucosa]]l inflammation, characterized by focal infiltration of [[neutrophils]], a type of inflammatory cell, into the [[epithelium]]. This typically occurs in the area overlying [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] aggregates. These neutrophils, along with [[lymphocyte|mononuclear cells]], may infiltrate the [[Crypts of Lieberkuhn|crypts]], leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess). [[Granuloma]]s, aggregates of [[macrophage]] derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show "caseation", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as [[tuberculosis]]. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal [[Intestinal villus|villi]], atypical branching of the crypts, and a change in the tissue type ([[metaplasia]]). One example of such metaplasia, ''Paneth cell metaplasia'', involves development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine and a key regulator of intestinal microbiota) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system.<ref name=Robbins>Crawford JM.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Classification ===
[[Image:Distribution of CD.svg|right|thumb|Distribution of gastrointestinal Crohn's disease. Based on data from [[American Gastroenterological Association]].]]
Crohn's disease is one type of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD). It typically manifests in the gastrointestinal tract and can be categorized by the specific tract region affected. A disease of both the [[ileum]] (the last part of the [[small intestine]] that connects to the [[large intestine]]), and the large intestine, [[Ileocolic]] Crohn's accounts for fifty percent of cases. Crohn's ileitis, manifest in the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, while Crohn's colitis, of the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from [[ulcerative colitis]]. Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine, called the jejunum (MedlinePlus 2010). The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to anus. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, with presentations in other areas.<ref name=Baumgart/>

Crohn's disease may also be categorized by the behavior of disease as it progresses. These categorizations formalized in the Vienna classification of the disease.<ref name=Vienna>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ibd.3780060103 |title=A simple classification of Crohn's disease: Report of the Working Party for the World Congresses of Gastroenterology, Vienna 1998|year=2007 |last1=Gasche |first1=Christoph |last2=Scholmerich |first2=Jurgen |last3=Brynskov |first3=Jorn |last4=d'Haens|first4=Geert |last5=Hanauer |first5=Stephen B. |last6=Irvine |first6=E.

Stricturing disease causes narrowing of the bowel that may lead to [[bowel obstruction]] or changes in the caliber of the [[feces]]. Penetrating disease creates abnormal passageways ([[fistula]]e) between the bowel and other structures, such as the skin. [[Inflammatory disease]] (or nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae.<ref name=Vienna/><ref name=phenotypes>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11938-003-0001-1 |title=Treatment of Crohn's disease of inflammatory, stenotic, and fistulizing phenotypes |year=2003 |last1=Dubinsky |first1=Marla C. |last2=Fleshner |first2=Phillip P.|journal=Current Treatment Options in Gastroenterology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=183–200 |pmid=12744819}}</ref>

=== Endoscopy ===
A [[colonoscopy]] is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the [[terminal ileum]], identifying the pattern of disease involvement. On occasion, the colonoscope can travel past the terminal ileum, but it varies from patient to patient. During the procedure, the [[gastroenterologist]] can also perform a [[biopsy]], taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis, which may help confirm a diagnosis. As 30% of Crohn's disease involves only the ileum,<ref name=Baumgart/> [[cannula]]tion of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum, but not the [[rectum]], is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata.<!-- is passed in the patient's faeces. It has been used in the search for Crohn's disease in the small bowel, which cannot be reached with colonoscopy or gastroscopy. --><ref name="Hara2006"/>
The utility of capsule endoscopy for this, however, is still uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Triester | first1 = SL | last2 = Leighton | first2 = JA | last3 = Leontiadis | first3 = GI | last4 = Gurudu | first4 = SR | last5 = Fleischer | first5 = DE | last6 = Hara | first6 = AK | last7 = Heigh | first7 = RI | last8 = Shiff | first8 = AD | last9 = Sharma | first9 = VK | year = 2006 | title = A meta-analysis of the yield of capsule endoscopy compared to other diagnostic modalities in patients with non-stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 101 | issue = 5 | pages = 954–64 | doi =10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00506.x | pmid = 16696781}}</ref> A "[[cobblestone]]"-like appearance is seen in approximately 40% of cases of Crohn's disease upon colonoscopy, representing areas of ulceration separated by narrow areas of healthy tissue.

=== Radiologic tests ===
A [[barium follow-through|small bowel follow-through]] may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the [[duodenum]], they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine. As a result, a [[barium follow-through]] X-ray, wherein [[barium sulfate]] suspension is ingested and [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic]] images of the bowel are taken over time, is useful for looking for inflammation and narrowing of the small bowel.<!--

=== Comparison with ulcerative colitis ===
The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is ulcerative colitis, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.<ref name=Baumgart/><ref name=emed/><ref name=Podolsky/>

There is no cure for Crohn's disease and [[remission (medicine)|remission]] may not be possible or prolonged if achieved. In cases where remission is possible, [[relapse]] can be prevented and [[symptom]]s controlled with medication, lifestyle and dietary changes, changes to eating habits (eating smaller amounts more often), reduction of stress, moderate activity and exercise.  Surgery is generally counter-indicated and has not been shown to prevent remission. Adequately controlled, Crohn's disease may not significantly restrict daily living.<ref name = WebMD>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage |title=Crohn's Disease: 54 Tips to Help You Manage | publisher = [[WebMD]] | last1 = Fries | first1 = WS | last2 = Nazario|first2= B | date = 2007-05-16 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}</ref> Treatment for Crohn's disease is only when symptoms are active and involve first treating the [[acute (medical)|acute]] problem, then maintaining [[remission (medicine)|remission]].

=== Lifestyle changes ===
Certain lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms, including [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] adjustments, [[elemental diet]], proper [[Drinking water|hydration]], and [[smoking cessation]]. Smoking may increase Crohn's disease; stopping is recommended. Eating small meals frequently instead of big meals may also help with a low appetite. To manage symptoms have a balanced diet with proper portion control. [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]] can be helped with regular exercise, a healthy diet, and enough sleep. A [[food diary]] may help with identifying foods that trigger symptoms. Some people should follow a low [[dietary fiber]] diet to control symptoms especially if fibrous foods cause symptoms.<ref name = WebMD/> Some find relief in eliminating casein (protein found in cow's milk) and gluten (protein found in wheat, rye and barley) from their diets. They may suffer from specific dietary intolerances (not allergies).<ref>{{cite book|last=Escott-Stump|first=Sylvia|title=Nutrition and Diagnosis-Related Care, 7th edition|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-1-60831-017-3|pages=1020 (pp 431)}}</ref>

=== Medication ===
Acute treatment uses medications to treat any infection (normally [[antibiotic]]s) and to reduce inflammation (normally [[aminosalicylic acid|aminosalicylate]] anti-inflammatory drugs and [[corticosteroid]]s). When symptoms are in remission, treatment enters maintenance, with a goal of avoiding the recurrence of symptoms. Prolonged use of corticosteroids has significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]]; as a result, they are, in general, not used for long-term treatment. Alternatives include aminosalicylates alone, though only a minority are able to maintain the treatment, and many require immunosuppressive drugs.<ref name="HanauerCrohns"/> It has been also suggested that antibiotics change the enteric flora, and their continuous use may pose the risk of overgrowth with pathogens such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''.<ref name="Shanahan">{{cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Fergus|title=Crohn's disease|journal=The Lancet|date=1 January 2002|volume=359|issue=9300|pages=62–69|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07284-7}}</ref>

The gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for this.

=== Surgery ===
Crohn's cannot be cured by [[surgery]], though it is used when partial or a full blockage of the intestine occurs. Surgery may also be required for complications such as obstructions, fistulas and/or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs. After the first surgery, Crohn's usually shows up at the site of the resection, however it can appear in other locations. After a resection, scar tissue builds up, which can cause [[stenosis|strictures]], which form when the intestines become too small to allow excrement to pass through easily, which can lead to a blockage. After the first resection, another resection may be necessary within five years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/surgeryprocedures/a/resectioncrohns.htm | title = Resection Surgery for Crohn's Disease | publisher = [[About.com]] | accessdate = 2008-02-14 | date = 2007-01-12 | last = Tresca | first = AJ }}</ref> For patients with an obstruction due to a stricture, two options for treatment are [[strictureplasty]] and resection of that portion of bowel. There is no [[statistical significance]] between strictureplasty alone versus strictureplasty and resection in cases of [[Duodenum|duodenal]] involvement. In these cases, re-operation rates were 31% and 27%, respectively, indicating that strictureplasty is a safe and effective treatment for selected patients with duodenal involvement.<ref name="pmid8918424">{{cite journal | author = Ozuner G, Fazio VW, Lavery IC, Milsom JW, Strong SA | title = Reoperative rates for Crohn's disease following strictureplasty.

[[Short bowel syndrome]] (SBS, also short gut syndrome or simply short gut) can be caused by the surgical removal of the small intestines. It usually develops in those having had half or more of their small intestines removed.<ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/shortbowel/ Short Bowel Syndrome] as defined by the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]]</ref> Diarrhea is the main symptom of short bowel syndrome, however other symptoms may include cramping, bloating, and heartburn. Short bowel syndrome is treated with changes in diet, intravenous feeding, vitamin and mineral supplements, and treatment with medications. Another complication following surgery for Crohn's disease in which the terminal ileum has been removed is the development of excessive watery diarrhea. This is due to an inability of the ileum to reabsorb bile acids after resection of the terminal ileum. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In some cases of SBS, intestinal transplant surgery may be considered; though the number of transplant centres offering this procedure is quite small and it comes with a high risk due to the chance of infection and rejection of the transplanted intestine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.revolutionhealth.com/conditions/digestive/crohns-disease/surgery/intestinal-transplant | title = Intestinal transplant for Crohn's disease | publisher =Everyday Health | accessdate = 2009-03-22 | date = 2006-10-24 | last = Rhodes | first = M }}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
Crohn's disease is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition for which there is no cure. It is characterised by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is relatively low. However, Crohn's disease is associated with an increased risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma, including bowel cancer.<ref name=Canavan>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02854.x |title=Meta-analysis: Colorectal and small bowel cancer risk in patients with Crohn's disease |year=2006 |last1=Canavan |first1=C. |last2=Abrams |first2=K. R. |last3=Mayberry |first3=J. |journal=Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=1097–104 |pmid=16611269}}</ref> It can vary from being benign to very severe and patients could experience just one episode or have continuous symptoms. It usually reoccurs, although some patients can remain disease free for years or decades. Most sufferers live a normal lifespan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/who_gets_crohns_disease_000103_5.htm|title=Crohn's disease - Prognosis|publisher=University of Maryland Medical Centre|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref>

Crohn's disease can lead to several mechanical complications within the intestines, including [[Bowel obstruction|obstruction]], fistulae, and abscesses. Obstruction typically occurs from [[strictures]] or [[adhesions]] that narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. Fistulae can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled off collections of [[infection]], which can occur in the [[abdomen]] or in the [[wiktionary:perianal|perianal]] area in Crohn's disease sufferers. Crohn's is responsible for 10% of vesicoenteric fistulae, and is the most common cause of ileovesical fistulae.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|442000|Enterovesical Fistula}}</ref>

Crohn's disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn's disease involving the [[small bowel]] are at higher risk for [[small intestinal cancer]]. Similarly, people with Crohn's colitis have a [[relative risk]] of 5.6 for developing [[colon cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ekbom A, Helmick C, Zack M, Adami H |title=Increased risk of large-bowel cancer in Crohn's disease with colonic involvement |journal=Lancet|volume=336 |issue=8711 |pages=357–9 |year=1990 |pmid=1975343 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(90)91889-I}}</ref> Screening for colon cancer with [[colonoscopy]] is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn's colitis for at least eight years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Collins P, Mpofu C, Watson A, Rhodes J | title = Strategies for detecting colon cancer and/or dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = |issue = 2| pages = CD000279 | year = 2006| pmid = 16625534 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000279.pub3 | editor1-last = Watson| editor1-first = Alastair J}}</ref> Some studies suggest there is a role for chemoprotection in the prevention of colorectal cancer in Crohn's involving the colon; two agents have been suggested, [[folate]] and [[mesalamine]]preparations.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Timothy L |last1=Zisman |first2=David T |last2=Rubin |pmid=18461651|doi=10.3748/wjg.14.2662 |journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology |title=Colorectal cancer and dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=17 |pages=2662–9 |pmc=2709054}}</ref>

Individuals with Crohn's disease are at risk of [[malnutrition]] for many reasons, including decreased food intake and [[malabsorption]]. The risk increases following resection of the [[small bowel]]. Such individuals may require oral supplements to increase their caloric intake, or in severe cases, [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN). Most people with moderate or severe Crohn's disease are referred to a [[dietitian]] for assistance in nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1091-255X(02)00132-4 |title=Home Total Parenteral Nutrition an Alternative to Early Surgery for Complicated Inflammatory Bowel Disease |year=2003 |last1=Evans |first1=J |journal=Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery |volume=7|issue=4 |pages=562–6 |pmid=12763417 |last2=Steinhart |first2=AH |last3=Cohen |first3=Z |last4=McLeod |first4=RS}}</ref>

Crohn's disease can be problematic during [[pregnancy]], and some medications can cause adverse outcomes for the [[fetus]]or mother. Consultation with an obstetrician and gastroenterologist about Crohn's disease and all medications allows preventative measures to be taken. In some cases, remission can occur during pregnancy. Certain medications can also impact [[sperm count]] or may otherwise adversely affect a man's ability to [[Fertilisation|conceive]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ccfa.org/about/news/pregnancy | publisher = [[Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America]] | date = 2005-10-21 | title = IBD and Pregnancy: What You Need to Know | last = Kaplan | first = C | accessdate = 2009-11-07}}</ref>

Crohn's disease has a [[bimodal distribution]] in [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] as a function of age: the disease tends to strike people in their teens and 20s, and people in their 50s through to their 70s, and ages in between due to not being diagnosed with Crohn's and being diagnosed instead with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS).<ref name=Baumgart/><ref name=emed/> It is rarely diagnosed in early childhood. It usually strikes females who are pediatric patients more severely than males.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfa.org/reuters/ibdboysgirls |title=Crohn's disease manifests differently in boys and girls |format= |publisher = [[Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America]] |accessdate=}}</ref> However, only slightly more women than men have Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw-popup/who-is-affected-by-crohns-disease |title=Who is affected by Crohn's disease |format= |publisher = Healthwise |accessdate=}}</ref> Parents, siblings or children of people with Crohn's disease are 3 to 20 times more likely to develop the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Satsangi J, Jewell DP, Bell JI |title=The genetics of inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Gut |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=572–4 |year=1997 |pmid=9203931 |pmc=1027155 |doi= }}</ref> Twin studies show a concordance of greater than 55% for Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tysk C, Lindberg E, Järnerot G, Flodérus-Myrhed B |title=Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in an unselected population of monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

== History ==
Inflammatory bowel diseases were described by [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] (1682–1771) and by [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician T. Kennedy Dalziel in 1913.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirsner JB |title=Historical aspects of inflammatory bowel disease |journal=J. Clin. Gastroenterol. |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=286–97 |year=1988 |pmid=2980764 |doi= 10.1097/00004836-198806000-00012|url=}}</ref>

''Ileitis terminalis'' was first described by Polish surgeon [[Antoni Leśniowski]] in 1904, however, due to the precedence of Crohn's name in the alphabet, it became later to be known in the worldwide literature as Crohn's disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Only in [[Poland]] it continues to be named Leśniowski-Crohn's disease. [[Burrill Bernard Crohn]], an American gastroenterologist at [[New York City]]'s [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], described fourteen cases in 1932, and submitted them to the [[American Medical Association]] under the rubric of "Terminal ileitis: A new clinical entity". Later that year, he, along with colleagues Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer published the case series as "Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity".<ref name=CrohnBB/>

==Research==
The Crohn's Allogeneic Transplant Study's investigation team of Seattle is currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial to cure Crohn's disease, involving bone marrow transplant, noting that cases in which bone marrow transplant had been done for a secondary purpose effectively cured the patient of Crohn's.<ref>http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018756084_immunetransplant24m.html</ref>

Researchers at [[University College London]] have questioned the wisdom of suppressing the immune system in Crohn's, as the problem may be an underactive rather than an overactive immune system: Their study found that Crohn's patients showed an abnormally low response to an introduced infection, marked by a poor flow of blood to the wound, and the response improved when the patients were given [[sildenafil|sildenafil citrate]].<ref name=Marks2006/>

Recent studies using [[helminthic therapy]] or [[hookworm]]s to treat Crohn's Disease and other (non-viral) auto-immune diseases seem to yield promising results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Croese J |title=A proof of concept study establishing Necator americanus in Crohn's patients and reservoir donors |journal=Gut |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=136–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16344586 |doi=10.1136/gut.2005.079129 |pmc=1856386 |author-separator=, |author2=O'neil J |author3=Masson J |display-authors=3 |last4=Cooke |first4=S |last5=Melrose |first5=W |last6=Pritchard |first6=D |last7=Speare |first7=R}}</ref>
