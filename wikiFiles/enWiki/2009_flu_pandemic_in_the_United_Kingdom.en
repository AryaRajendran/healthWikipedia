| New Swine Flu cases increased to 84,000. Deaths increased to 154. 848 people are hospitalised, 172 of which are in intensive care.

However Swine flu deaths in England in a single week reached their highest level with a record 21 deaths, bringing the total deaths to 245 in the UK (163 in England). There were 753 hospitalised patients, 154 of those being in intensive care. The Government estimates more than a million people have now been vaccinated, roughly a month after the vaccination program started (that figure excludes health care workers, who are also being offered the vaccine). That means only about 1 in 10 of the 11 million people in the "at risk" priority groups have so far been vaccinated.

| New Swine Flu cases more than halved from the previous week, dropping to 22,000 new cases in England in the last week. Total deaths increased to 270 (178 deaths in England). There are 747 hospitalised patients – 161 of which are in critical care. A further 600,000 people were vaccinated in the last week, bringing total to 1.6&nbsp;million people. In addition to that, 275,000 healthcare workers have been vaccinated out of nearly 2 million. [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]] Sir Liam Donaldson said it was still "too early" to know whether the downward trend in new cases would continue and that his biggest worry was the virus mutating or mixing with other viruses and creating a new, more dangerous virus. Prof David Salisbury, head of immunisation at the Department of Health, said the vaccines with [[Immunologic adjuvant|adjuvants]], substances which boost the immune system and allow less active ingredient to be used in each dose, offer good protection even if the virus does change; "One of the advantages with adjuvanted vaccines is their ability to protect against drifted (mutated) strains. It opens the door for a whole new strategy in dealing with flu." The [[GlaxoSmithKline]] vaccine, [[Pandemrix]], which forms the bulk of the governments mass vaccination programme with 11.2&nbsp;million doses delivered so far to health services, contains an adjuvant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1259152076662?p=1231252394302 |title=Weekly pandemic flu media update |publisher=HPA |accessdate=4 December 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091203223838/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1259152076662?p=1231252394302| archivedate= 3 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8393651.stm |title=New infections of swine flu 'on the way down' |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=4 December 2009 | date=3 December 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091206234705/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8393651.stm| archivedate= 6 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/6719861/Change-in-swine-flu-virus-is-my-biggest-fear-Liam-Donaldson.html |title=Change in swine flu virus is my biggest fear: Liam Donaldson |publisher=Telegraph |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009 | location=London | first=Rebecca | last=Smith| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091206031729/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/6719861/Change-in-swine-flu-virus-is-my-biggest-fear-Liam-Donaldson.html| archivedate= 6 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Flu/Swineflu/DH_109578 |title=3 December 2009 – Weekly swine flu update : Department of Health – Public health |publisher=Dh.gov.uk |accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>

|10 December
| New Swine Flu cases halved from the previous week, to 11,000 new cases in England. Deaths increased to 283 (191 in England) and there were currently 636 hospitalised patients. The number of people vaccinated increased to 2.3&nbsp;million. The estimated total number of cases is 795,000. The Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson revealed that the swine flu pandemic is "considerably less lethal" than feared. An analysis of deaths to 8 November showed that 26 people have died for every 100,000 cases in England, meaning a [[death rate]] of 0.026% in those infected with Swine Flu. The highest death rate was in those aged over 65, and lowest in those aged 5 to 14. The average age at death was 39. Of the patients who died, 67% were in the "high risk" vaccination priority group and were eligible to get vaccinated, 36% had either no or only mild pre-existing illnesses. Sir Liam again urged people to come forward for immunisation, commenting that a lower impact than previously feared "is not a justification for public health inaction. Our data supports the priority vaccination of high risk groups. Given that a substantial minority of deaths occur in previously healthy people, there is a case for extending the vaccination programme".<ref>{{cite news|last=Triggle |first=Nick |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8406723.stm |title=Swine flu less lethal than feared |publisher=BBC News  |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091216231059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8406723.stm| archivedate= 16 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/6780116/Swine-flu--considerably-less-lethal-than-feared.html |title=Swine flu: "considerably less lethal" than feared |publisher=Telegraph |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010 | location=London | first=Kate | last=Devlin| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091213175240/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/6780116/Swine-flu--considerably-less-lethal-than-feared.html| archivedate= 13 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Flu/Swineflu/DH_109929 |title=10 December 2009 – Weekly swine flu update : Department of Health – Public health |publisher=Dh.gov.uk |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1259152211290?p=1231252394302 |title=Weekly pandemic flu media update |publisher=HPA |accessdate=15 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100115023821/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1259152211290?p=1231252394302| archivedate= 15 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref>

==Reported cases==
{{Update|date=November 2009}}

Until 2 July 2009 the HPA published daily reports<ref name=HPAinfo/> of laboratory-confirmed cases with breakdown by region, by age, and by source of infection (travel, community, etc.). From that date routine laboratory testing of all suspected cases and reporting of figures was discontinued. {{As of|2009|7|8}} figures shown in this article are laboratory confirmed cases reported on 2 July.

Deaths are often reported as occurring "after contracting the swine flu virus" without flu being necessarily the cause of death of people with underlying health problems.

Researchers at Imperial College London said in July 2009 that the best estimate was that about 0.5% of those who get swine flu ''bad enough to seek medical help'' die from it, a figure very similar to the estimate for seasonal influenza.<ref>{{cite web |title=What are the chances of dying from swine flu? |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |last=Walsh|first=Fergus|publisher=BBC  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/ferguswalsh/2009/07/what_are_the_chances_of_dying_from_swine_flu.html}}</ref>

Every year in late June and early July the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tennis championships are held in London, attracting worldwide interest and with many hours of UK television coverage every day. On 1 July 2009 it was reported that 28 Wimbledon staff had been asked to stay at home with flu-like symptoms. Two named players are reported to have caught the virus.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196669/Fears-Wimbledon-players-struck-swine-flu.html Mail Online: Two Wimbledon players struck down by swine flu, 1 July 2009]</ref>

A study published in the August 2009 issue of [[The Lancet]] (available on 20 July) suggests that prolonging the school holidays could reduce the spread of the virus by up to 17%. This would be disruptive, and would not reduce the overall number of infections, but could delay the spread and buy time for preparation of a vaccine. The government's advice is that schools should not be closed, but that the evidence will be reviewed in August as school summer holidays end.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu: schools should close to halt spread of virus ministers told |last=Wardrop |first=Murray |date=21 July 2009 |newspaper=The Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/5874683/Swine-flu-schools-should-close-to-halt-spread-of-virus-ministers-told.html | location=London| accessdate= 16 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Call to close schools to curb flu |date=21 July 2009 |newspaper=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8160314.stm |accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>

On 11 May 2009 UK epidemiologists at [[Imperial College London]] considered that H1N1 swine flu was spreading fast enough to justify the preparations for a pandemic. It was showing "sustained human-to-human transmission", thereby justifying the WHO's pandemic phase 5 rating. It is estimated that on average each person who contracts flu passes it on to between 1.4 and 1.6 other people, no worse than the three [[influenza pandemic]]s of the twentieth century. Early analysis suggested that the spread was likely to be similar to the earlier pandemics. Up to the date of the study, clinical severity was similar to [[Asian Flu|1957]] and less than 1918 flu pandemic. However, the clinical severity of the outbreak and how the virus will evolve cannot yet be predicted.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17109-first-analysis-of-swine-flu-spread-supports-pandemic-plan.html New Scientist magazine website: First analysis of swine flu spread supports pandemic plan, 11 May 09]</ref>

Until 21 May HPA staff met travellers arriving from Mexico. This was discontinued on 22 May, but advice remained that travellers from affected areas who become unwell within seven days of arrival, and contacts with symptoms of a confirmed or probable case, should stay at home and contact their GP or [[NHS Direct]].

The Department of Health has listed all the pandemic flu guidance that it had published as of 8 June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Department of Health flu guidance publications as of 8 June 2009|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Flu/PandemicFlu/DH_093202|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jhOPSEf5|archivedate=10 September 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>

===Testing suspected cases===
====Genetic analysis====
Samples from suspected cases have been analysed by the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in London, which is also examining samples of the U.S. strain of the disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/news/2009/h1n1_02may09/ |title=NIMR scientists discuss swine-like human influenza A H1N1 |publisher=National Institute for Medical Research|date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090617021308/http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/news/2009/h1n1_02may09/| archivedate= 17 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

By 8 May 2009 the US [[Centres for Disease Control and Prevention]] had made genetic information on the swine flu virus available, and the virus from European samples had been isolated and its full genetic fingerprint determined by UK researchers.<ref name=BBCsequencing>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8040000.stm BBC: UK swine flu genetics unravelled. 8 May 09]</ref> The genetics and effects of the virus in general are discussed in the article on the [[2009 swine flu outbreak#Genetics and effects|2009 swine flu outbreak]].

====Diagnosis====
The fastest way for laboratory confirmation of swine flu is by the [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] method, described as a real-time method. According to the World Health Organization there are four laboratories in the UK able to perform PCR to diagnose influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in humans: Regional Virus Laboratory, [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]], NI; Regional Virus Laboratory, [[Gartnavel General Hospital]], Glasgow, Scotland; Health Protection Agency, [[UK statutory notification system|Centre for Infections, Enteric, Respiratory, & Neurological Virus Laboratory]], London; [[National Influenza Centers|WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza]], National Institute for Medical Research, London.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/InfluenzaLabsWithPCRcapacityToDetectInfluenzaA_20090508a.pdf WHO list of countries able to perform PCR to diagnose influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in humans, 8 May 09]</ref>

Another laboratory confirmation is a fourfold increase in virus-specific antibodies 10 to 14 days later.<ref>[http://www.selectscience.net/product-news/sterilin-limited/sterilin-backs-hpa-guidelines-for-swine-flu-detection/?artID=18071 Article describing HPA guidelines for detecting swine flu]</ref>

From 2 July 2009 when a treatment, rather than containment, approach was adopted, the official clinical diagnostic criteria became: "fever ([[pyrexia]] ≥38 °C) or a history of fever, '''and''' also influenza-like illness (two or more of the following symptoms: cough; sore throat; [[rhinorrhoea]]; limb or joint pain; headache; vomiting or [[diarrhoea]]) '''or''' severe and/or life-threatening illness suggestive of an infectious process".<ref name=HPA4medics>{{cite web |title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza: information for health professionals |date=30 September 2009 |publisher=Health Protection Agency |accessdate=25 October 2009 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=HPAweb%252FPage%252FHPAwebAutoListName&cid=1240812234677&p=1240812234677&pagename=HPAwebWrapper}}</ref>

;"Laboratory confirmed" cases
Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, who advises the Government and the World Health Organisation, said on 8 June 2009 that HPA statistics were at best accounting for half of cases.<ref>[http://www.esnews.co.uk/?p=3938&mode=1 Emergency Services news: Number of UK swine flu cases underestimated, 8 June 2009]</ref>

In the [[2009 flu pandemic in the United States|USA]] mathematical modelling based on surveys estimated that there were about 1 million cases of H1N1 flu on 25 June 2009, compared to 28,000 reported officially.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/feeds/hscout/2009/06/25/hscout628467.html Forbes – 1&nbsp;million Americans Likely Stricken by Swine Flu: CDC]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Areas Hit Hard by Flu in Spring See Little Now |author=Anemona Hartocollis and Donald G.

===Hygiene recommendations===
According to the Health Protection Agency's "Swine flu: frequently asked questions" web page,<ref name=HPAswineflufaq>{{cite web |title=Swine flu: frequently asked questions |date=10 December 2009 |publisher=Health Protection Agency |accessdate=15 December 2009 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1240812255916?p=1244763941666| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091214075812/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1240812255916?p=1244763941666| archivedate= 14 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref> transmission of this new virus is thought to occur in the same way as seasonal flu:
* large droplets from coughing and/or sneezing by an infected person within a short distance (usually 1 metre or less) of someone;
* touching or shaking the hand of an infected person, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth without first washing your hands;
* touching surfaces or objects (e.g. door handles) that have become contaminated with the flu virus, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth without first washing your hands.

When the issue of touching your eyes, nose or mouth is combined with other [[infection control]] practices and good hygiene measures as recommended by the Health Protection Agency's website,<ref name=HPAinfo/> the following recommendations emerge as important ways to help reduce the spread of swine flu and other viruses:
* Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth without first washing your hands.
* Cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, and use a tissue when possible.
* Dispose of dirty tissues promptly and carefully.
* Maintain good basic hygiene, for example [[hand washing|washing hands]] frequently with soap and water to reduce the spread of the virus from your hands to your face, or to other people.
* Clean hard surfaces, such as door handles, frequently using a normal cleaning product.
* Make sure children follow this advice.
* Anyone with swine flu or being investigated as a possible case will be given anti-virals and asked to stay at home and limit their contact with other people.
* Where anti-virals are prescribed the course of treatment must be followed and completed, although it may sometimes cause nausea.

For people belonging to a high-risk group it is particularly important that they start taking anti-virals as soon as possible after infection. High-risk groups include people with long-term conditions, those over 65, children under five and pregnant women.<ref name=HPA4medics/>

===Immunity===
A study at the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published in May 2009 found that children had no pre-existing [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the new strain but that adults, particularly those over 60, had some degree of immunity. Children showed no cross-reactive [[antibody]] reaction to the new strain, adults aged 18 to 64 had 6–9%, and older adults 33%.<ref name=CIDRAP>[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/may2109serum-jw.html CIDRAP news: Some immunity to novel H1N1 flu found in seniors, 21 May 2009]</ref> The large proportion of cases in the UK affecting children and young adults is consistent with this pattern of resistance.<ref name=Young>[http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1243322117077 HPA Update 26 May 09]</ref><ref name=Young2>[http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1245581553306 HPA epidemiological update for 24 June 09]</ref>

===Vaccine===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic vaccine}}
The usual [[flu season|seasonal flu]] [[vaccine]]s give little or no immunity against the new strain of flu. There is an international program to produce a vaccine which will be effective against the new H1N1 strain. The chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said on 25 June that it seemed likely that the UK would receive the first batches of vaccines slightly earlier than expected, possibly from August rather than the autumn as first expected, although some industry sources do not expect supplies to be available so soon. The government has contracts for 132 million doses.<ref name=CMO25Jun09/> There are risks involved in shifting resources to the new vaccine: it will not be possible to produce the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is possible that the virus will [[mutation|mutate]] to make a vaccine developed before the mutation ineffective.

===Possible use of face-masks===
[[Image:Alan Johnson -9Oct2007-2.jpg|thumb|120px|Alan Johnson, Health Secretary at the time of the outbreak]]
The then [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] Alan Johnson told MPs on 27 April that "Although we are aware that face-masks are being given out to the public in Mexico, the available [[scientific evidence]] does not support the general wearing of face-masks by those who are not ill, whilst going about their normal activities."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8021813.stm Swine flu cases confirmed in UK], BBC News Online, 27 April 2009</ref>

Professor Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said people in the UK were "perfectly safe at the moment", and did not need to start wearing face-masks or stop eating pork.<ref>{{cite news |title=UK prepared for swine flu – Brown |date=28 April 2009 |newspaper=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8021916.stm |accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>

The Head of Pandemic Planning at the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]], Dr Maureen Baker, stated on 27 April that "Masks become ineffective when they become damp or after a few hours. There has been a lot of debate on the use of face-masks and some authorities say that, in the community, the most effective use is to give to patients who may have symptoms when they present in the surgery – that should help reduce the infectivity of that patient to surgery staff and other patients. I expect the Department of Health will issue guidance on use of face-masks if we move into a pandemic phase."<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu: Your questions |date=1 May 2009 |newspaper=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8020596.stm |quote=BBC News online put a number of your questions to the experts. |accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref> Masks may not protect the wearer from inhalation of the virus, but might protect other people from picking up the virus from the wearer.<ref name=IndepFaceMask>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/will-a-face-mask-help-protect-me-are-there-enough-antiviral-drugs-1675173.html Will a face mask help to protect me? Are there enough anti-viral drugs?], ''The Independent'', 28 April 2009</ref>

Professor John Oxford, a virologist at leading London hospital, [[Barts and The London NHS Trust|The Barts and the London]], said: "Really, there is very little evidence that masks actually offer much protection against flu."<ref>{{cite news |title=Can masks help stop flu spread? |last=Triggle |first=Nick |date=29 April 2009 |newspaper=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8024605.stm |accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>

It is reported that the UK government is urgently seeking to acquire more face-masks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/97522/Swine-flu-Why-face-masks-could-be-useless |title=Daily Express &#124; UK News :: Swine flu: Why face masks could be useless |publisher=Express.co.uk |accessdate=29 April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090501055556/http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/97522/Swine-flu-Why-face-masks-could-be-useless| archivedate= 1 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=dailymail1>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1174313/8216-I-8217-ve-experienced-like-8217--England-8217-s-victim-contract-swine-flu-human-speaks-ordeal.html |title=NHS under strain as doctors warn of lack of anti-viral drugs and shortage of facemasks &#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |accessdate=29 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/5238448/Swine-flu-NHS-orders-30-million-extra-face-masks.html |title=Swine flu: NHS orders 30 million extra face masks |publisher=Telegraph |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=29 April 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090501230513/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/5238448/Swine-flu-NHS-orders-30-million-extra-face-masks.html| archivedate= 1 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The advice given by authorities in several countries on the use of face masks has been summarised in an article, with many references, published on 4 June 2009.<ref>[http://elements.healthspace.com/?p=950 Information from several Health Agencies about face masks.]</ref>

{{Quotation|Aside from their obligations under health and safety legislation, employers can help to minimise the spread of the virus and support good infection control practice by positively encouraging any employee who reports feeling unwell with influenza-like symptoms to stay at home until their symptoms resolve, by sending people home who develop influenza-like illness at work (avoiding public transport and wearing a face mask if possible) and by ensuring that stocks of surgical face-masks are available in the workplace for symptomatic staff to wear until they get home.|[[UK Department of Health|DoH]] Pandemic Flu Plan<ref name=PandemicPlan/>|November 2007}}
