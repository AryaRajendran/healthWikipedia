'''Hereditary elliptocytosis''', also known as ovalocytosis, is an inherited blood disorder in which an abnormally large number of the patient's [[erythrocytes]] (i.e. red blood cells) are [[ellipse|elliptical]] rather than the typical [[wiktionary:biconcave|biconcave]] disc shape. It is one of many red-cell membrane defects. In its severe forms, this disorder predisposes to [[haemolytic anaemia]]. In [[camelids]], elliptocytosis is normal.

==Historical perspective==
Elliptocytosis was first described in 1904,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dresbach M |title=Elliptical human red corpuscles |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=19 |pages=469–470 |year=1904 |pmid=17730874 |doi=10.1126/science.19.481.469 |issue=481}}</ref> and was first recognised as a [[heredity|hereditary]] condition in 1932.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hunter, WC |title=Further study of a white family showing elliptical erythrocytes |journal=[[Ann Intern Med]] |volume=6 |pages=775–781|year=1932}}</ref> More recently it has become clear that the severity of the condition is highly variable,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16304353 |doi=10.1182/asheducation-2005.1.13 |year=2005 |author=Gallagher, Pg |title=Red cell membrane disorders. |volume= 2005|issue= 1|pages=13–8 |journal=Hematology / the Education Program of the American Society of Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program |url=http://www.asheducationbook.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16304353 |format=Free full text}}</ref> and there is much genetic [[heterogeneity|variability]] amongst those affected.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10027705 |year=1999 |month= January|author=Tse, Wt; Lux, Se |title=Red blood cell membrane disorders. |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=2–13 |issn=0007-1048 |journal=British journal of haematology |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1999.01130.x}}</ref>

==Genetic prevalence==

The incidence of hereditary elliptocytosis is hard to determine, as many sufferers of the milder forms of the disorder are [[asymptomatic]] and their condition never comes to medical attention. Around 90% of those with this disorder are thought to fall into the asymptomatic population. It is estimated that its incidence is between 3 and 5 per 10,000 in the [[USA]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13864689 |year=1962 |month= July|author=Bannerman, Rm; Renwick, Jh |title=The hereditary elliptocytoses: clinical and linkage data. |volume=26 |issue= 1|pages=23–38 |issn=0003-4800 |journal=Annals of Human Genetics |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1962.tb01306.x}}</ref> and that those of [[Africa]]n and [[Mediterranean]] descent are of higher risk. Because it can confer resistance to [[malaria]], some subtypes of hereditary elliptocytosis are significantly more prevalent in regions where malaria is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]]. For example, in equatorial Africa its incidence is estimated at 60-160 per 10,000,<ref name=hoffman>{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = R | authorlink = Ronald Hoffman | coauthors = Benz, E, Shattil, S, Furie, B and Cohen, H | title = Hoffman Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice | edition = 4th | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | year = 2005 | location = Philadelphia | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-443-06628-0}}</ref> and in [[Malaysia|Malayan]] natives its incidence is 1500-2000 per 10,000.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3329776 |year=1987 |author=Cattani, Ja; Gibson, Fd; Alpers, Mp; Crane, Gg |title=Hereditary ovalocytosis and reduced susceptibility to malaria in Papua New Guinea. |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=705–9 |issn=0035-9203 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/malaria.html |format=Free full text |doi=10.1016/0035-9203(87)90001-0}}</ref>  Almost all forms of hereditary elliptocytosis are [[autosomal dominant]], and both sexes are therefore at equal risk of having the condition. The most important exception to this rule of autosomal dominance is for a subtype of hereditary elliptocytosis called [[hereditary pyropoikilocytosis]] (HPP), which is [[autosomal recessive]].

There are three major forms of hereditary elliptocytosis: common hereditary elliptocytosis, spherocytic elliptocytosis and southeast Asian ovalocytosis. 

Common hereditary elliptocytosis is the most common form of elliptocytosis, and the form most extensively researched. Even when looking only at this form of elliptocytosis, there is a high degree of variability in the clinical severity of its subtypes. A clinically significant [[haemolytic anaemia]] occurs only in 5-10% of sufferers, with a strong bias towards those with more severe subtypes of the disorder.

Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and spherocytic elliptocytosis are less common subtypes predominantly affecting those of south-east Asian and European ethnic groups, respectively.

The following categorisation of the disorder demonstrates its heterogeneity:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coetzer T, Lawler J, Prchal JT, Palek J |title=Molecular determinants of clinical expression of hereditary elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=766–72 |date=1 September 1987|pmid=3620700 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3620700 }}</ref>
*'''Common hereditary elliptocytosis''' (in approximate order from least severe to most severe)
**With [[asymptomatic]] carrier status - ''the individual has no symptoms of disease and diagnosis is only able to be made on [[blood film]]''
**With mild disease - ''the individual has no symptoms and a mild and compensated haemolytic anaemia''
**With sporadic [[haemolysis]] - ''the individual has a predilection towards haemolysis in the presence of particular [[comorbidities]], including [[infection]]s, and [[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]] deficiency''
**With [[neonate|neonatal]] [[poikilocytosis]] - ''during the first year of life'' only ''the individual has a symptomatic haemolytic anaemia with poikilocytosis''
**With [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] haemolysis - ''the individual has a moderate to severe symptomatic haemolytic anaemia (this subtype has variable [[penetrance]] in some [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]])''
**With [[Zygosity|homozygosity]] or compound [[Zygosity|heterozygosity]] - ''depending on the exact mutations involved, the individual may lie anywhere in the spectrum between having a mild haemolytic anaemia and having a life-threatening haemolytic anaemia with symptoms mimicking those of HPP (see below)''
**With [[pyropoikilocytosis]] (HPP) - ''the individual is typically of African descent and has a life-threateningly severe haemolytic anaemia with micropoikilocytosis (small and misshapen erythrocytes) that is compounded by a marked instability of erythrocytes in even mildly elevated temperatures (pyropoikilocytosis is often found in burns victims and is the term is commonly used in reference to such people)
*'''South-east Asian ovalocytosis''' (SAO) (also called '''stomatocytic elliptocytosis''') - ''the individual is of South-East Asian descent (typically [[Malaysia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n, [[New Guinea]]n or [[Filipino people|Filipino]], has a mild haemolytic anaemia, and has increased resistance to [[malaria]]''
*'''Spherocytic elliptocytosis''' (also called '''hereditary haemolytic ovalocytosis''') - ''the individual is European descent and elliptocytes and spherocytes are simultaneously present in their blood''

==Pathophysiology==

===Common hereditary elliptocytosis===
A number of genes have been linked to common hereditary elliptocytosis (many involve the same gene as forms of [[Hereditary spherocytosis]], or HS):

These mutations have a common end result; they destabilise the [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in erythrocytes as they are constantly under the influence of deforming [[shear stress|shear forces]]. As disc-shaped erythrocytes pass through [[capillaries]], which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to fit through. Normally, this deformation lasts only as long as a cell is present in a capillary, but in hereditary elliptocytosis the instability of the cytoskeleton means that erythrocytes deformed by passing through a capillary are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the [[spleen]] and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the erythrocytes of people with hereditary elliptocytosis have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days or more).[[File:Cytoskeleton (Elliptocytosis).JPG|thumb|450px|Figure 2 - A schematic diagram representing the relationships between cytoskeletal molecules as relevant to hereditary elliptocytosis.]]

* EL2 and EL3: The most common genetic defects (present in two-thirds of all cases of hereditary elliptocytosis) are in genes for the [[polypeptide]]s α-spectrin or β-spectrin. These two polypeptides combine with one another ''in vivo'' to form an αβ [[protein dimer|heterodimer]]. These αβ heterodimers then combine together to form [[spectrin]] [[tetrameric protein|tetramer]]s.  These spectrin tetramers are among the basic structural subunits of the cytoskeleton of all cells in the body. Although there is much interindividual variability, it is generally true that α-spectrin mutations result in an inability of α-spectrin to interact properly with β-spectrin to form a heterodimer. In contrast, it is generally true that β-spectrin mutations lead to αβ heterodimers being incapable of combining to form spectrin tetramers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McMullin MF |title=The molecular basis of disorders of the red cell membrane |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=245–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10474512 |pmc=501324 |doi= 10.1136/jcp.52.4.245|url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10474512}}</ref> In both cases the end result is a weakness in the cytoskeleton of the cell. Individuals with a single mutation in one of the spectrin genes are usually asymptomatic, but those who are homozygotes or are [[compound heterozygosity|compound heterozygote]]s (i.e. they are heterozygous for two different elliptocytosis-causing mutations) have sufficient [[cell membrane]] instability to have a clinically significant [[haemolytic anaemia]].

* EL1: Less common than spectrin mutations are [[band 4.1]] mutations. Spectrin tetramers must bind to [[actin]] in order to create a proper cytoskeleton scaffold, and band 4.1 is an important protein involved in the stabilisation of the link between spectrin and actin. Similarly to the spectrin mutations, band 4.1 mutations cause a mild haemolytic anaemia in the heterozygous state, and a severe haemolytic disease in the homozygous state.

* EL4: [[Southeast Asian ovalocytosis]] is associated with the [[Band 3]] protein.

* Another group of mutations that lead to elliptocytosis are those that cause [[glycophorin C]] deficiencies. There are three phenotypes caused by abnormal glycophorin C, these are named Gerbich, Yus and Leach (see [[glycophorin C]] for more information). Only the rarest of the three, the Leach phenotype, causes elliptocytosis. Glycophorin C has the function of holding band 4.1 to the cell membrane. It is thought that elliptocytosis in glycophorin C deficiency is actually the consequence of a band 4.1 deficit, as glycophorin C deficient individuals also have reduced intracellular band 4.1 (probably due to the reduced number of binding sites for band 4.1 in the absence of glycoprotein C).

Inheritance of multiple mutations tends to infer more serious disease. For instance, the most common [[genotype]] responsible for HPP occurs when the affected individual inherits an α-spectrin mutation from one parent (i.e. one parent has hereditary elliptocytosis) and the other parent passes on an as-yet-undefined defect that causes the affected individual's cells to preferentially produce the defective α-spectrin rather than normal α-spectrin.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of hereditary elliptocytosis is usually made by coupling a family history of the condition with an appropriate clinical presentation and confirmation on a [[blood smear]]. In general it requires that at least 25% of erythrocytes in the specimen are abnormally elliptical in shape, though the observed percentage of elliptocytes can be 100%. This is in contrast to the rest of the population, in which it is common for up to 15% of erythrocytes to be elliptical.<ref name="Doherty2010">{{cite book|author=Gerard M. Doherty|title=Current Diagnosis & Treatment - Surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a14yDQKv4vMC&pg=RA1-PA204|accessdate=5 May 2011|edition=13th|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-163515-8|pages=204–5}}</ref> 

If some doubt remains regarding the diagnosis, definitive diagnosis can involve [[osmotic fragility]] testing, an [[autohaemolysis]] test, and direct protein assaying by [[gel electrophoresis]].<ref name="HillmanAult2005">{{cite book|author1=Robert S. Hillman|author2=Kenneth A. Ault|author3=Henry M. Rinder|title=Hematology in clinical practice: a guide to diagnosis and management|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJs1VpA8SEoC&pg=PA147|accessdate=5 May 2011|edition=4th|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-144035-6|page=147}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The vast majority of those with hereditary elliptocytosis require no treatment whatsoever. They have a mildly increased risk of developing [[gallstones]], which is treated surgically with a [[cholecystectomy]] if pain becomes problematic.

[[Folate]] helps to reduce the extent of haemolysis in those with significant haemolysis due to hereditary elliptocytosis. 

Because the [[spleen]] breaks down old and worn-out blood cells, those individuals with more severe forms of hereditary elliptocytosis can have a [[splenomegaly]], spenectomy can be performed in case that their situation may cause a worsening of the signs and symptoms of their anaemia. These can include:
*Vague, poorly localised abdominal pain
*Fatigue and [[dyspnoea]]
*Growth failure
*Leg ulcers
*[[Gallstones]].
Removal of the spleen ([[splenectomy]]) is effective in reducing the severity of these complications, but is associated with an increased risk of overwhelming bacterial [[septicaemia]], and is only performed on those with significant complications. Because many [[neonate]]s with severe elliptocytosis progress to have only a mild disease, and because this age group is particularly susceptible to [[pneumococcal]] infections, a splenectomy is only performed on those under 5 years old when it is absolutely necessary. 

Because chronic haemolysis increases an individual's risk of gallstones, people with elliptocytosis have an increased risk of suffering from gallstones. This risk is relative to the severity of the disease, and those with symptomatic elliptocytosis should have regular abdominal [[ultrasounds]] to monitor the progression of their [[gall bladder]] disease.

==Prognosis==
Those with hereditary elliptocytosis have a good [[prognosis]], only those with very severe disease have a shortened [[life expectancy]].
