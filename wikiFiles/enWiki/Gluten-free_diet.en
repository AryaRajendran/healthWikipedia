A '''gluten-free diet''' is a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] that excludes foods containing [[gluten]]. Gluten is a protein complex found in  [[wheat]] (including [[kamut]] and [[spelt]]), [[barley]], [[rye]] and [[triticale]]. A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]].<ref name=SafeAmount>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02768.x}}</ref> Being gluten intolerant can often mean a person may also be wheat intolerant as well as suffer from the related inflammatory skin condition [[dermatitis herpetiformis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/|title=Coeliac Disease|publisher=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health|year=2008}}</ref> There are a smaller minority of people who suffer from wheat intolerance alone and are tolerant to gluten.

A gluten-free diet might also exclude [[oat]]s. Medical practitioners are divided on whether oats are acceptable to celiac disease sufferers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/82/972/672|title=Celiac disease and oats: a systematic review|publisher=The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine|author=N Y Haboubi, S Taylor, S Jones|year=2006}}</ref> or whether they become cross-contaminated in milling facilities by other grains.<ref>[http://www.celiacsociety.com/celiacinfo_diet.asp "The Gluten-Free Diet" – CeliacSociety.com]</ref> Oats may also be contaminated when grown in rotation with wheat when wheat seeds from the previous harvest sprout up the next season in the oat field and are harvested along with the oats.

The term ''gluten-free'' generally is used to indicate a supposedly harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence.<ref name=Akobeng2008>{{Cite journal|author=Akobeng AK, Thomas AG |title=Systematic review: tolerable amount of gluten for people with coeliac disease |journal=Aliment. Pharmacol.

A 2008 [[systematic review]] tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10&nbsp;mg of gluten per day for celiac disease patients is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been conducted.<ref name=Akobeng2008/>

Regulation of the label, ''gluten-free'', varies widely by country. In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued proposed regulations in 2007 limiting the use of "gluten-free" in food products to those with less than 20 [[parts per million]] of gluten.<ref>Section 206 of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, Title II of {{USStatute|108|282|118|891|2004|08|02}}</ref><ref>{{USFR|72|2795}}-2817</ref> The current international [[Codex Alimentarius]] standard allows for 20 parts per million of gluten in so-called "gluten-free" foods.<ref name=CodexOfficial>{{Cite web| publisher = FAO/WHO | title = Current Official Standards | url = http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/standard_list.jsp | accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> There is at least one website with a table containing information on "gluten-free" food manufacturers and the gluten-parts-per-million levels to which each of those manufacturers tests.<ref name="Gluten PPM Table">{{Cite web| publisher = About.com | title = Gluten PPM Table | url = http://celiacdisease.about.com/od/PreventingCrossContamination/a/Gluten-Free-PPM-table.htm | accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

== Gluten-free food ==
Gluten-free food is normally seen as a diet for celiac disease, but people with a gluten allergy (an unrelated disease) should also avoid all other grains.

[[Image:Chenopodium_quinoa0.jpg#file|thumb|250px|[[Quinoa]] is a grain that is gluten-free]]
Several grains and [[starch]] sources are considered acceptable for a gluten-free diet. The most frequently used are [[maize|corn]], [[potato]]es, [[rice]], and [[tapioca]] (derived from [[cassava]]). Other grains and starch sources generally considered suitable for gluten-free diets include [[amaranth]], [[arrowroot]], [[millet]], [[montina]], [[lupin]], [[quinoa]], [[sorghum]] (jowar), [[taro]], [[teff]], [[chia seed]], and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]. Sometimes various types of [[bean]], [[soybean]], and [[nut (fruit)|nut]] [[flour]]s are used in gluten-free products to add [[protein]] and [[dietary fiber]]. 

Almond flour has a low glycemic index, and is a low-carbohydrate alternative to wheat flour. In spite of its name, [[buckwheat]] is not related to wheat. Pure buckwheat is considered acceptable for a gluten-free diet, however, many commercial buckwheat products are mixtures of wheat and buckwheat flours, and thus, not gluten-free. [[Gram flour]], derived from [[chickpea]]s, also is gluten-free (this is not the same as [[Graham flour]] made from wheat).

[[Image:Chickpea.jpg#file|thumb|250px|[[Chickpea]]s]]
Gluten may be used in foods in some unexpected ways, for example it may be added as a [[food additive|stabilizing agent]] or thickener in products such as [[ice-cream]] and [[ketchup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn030331.html|title=Gluten sensitivity more widespread than previously thought|publisher=Colorado State University Extension|author=Pat Kendall, Ph.D., R.D.|date=March 31, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bidmc.harvard.edu/default.asp?leaf_id=12799|title=Following a Gluten-free Diet|publisher=Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|author= |date= A Harvard teaching hospital}}</ref>

People wishing to follow a completely gluten-free diet must take into consideration the ingredients of any over-the-counter or prescription medications and vitamins. Also, cosmetics such as lipstick, lip balms, and lip gloss may contain gluten and need to be investigated before use. Glues used on envelopes may also contain gluten.

Most products manufactured for [[Passover]] are gluten-free. Exceptions are foods that list [[matzah]] as an ingredient, usually in the form of cake meal.<ref>[http://www.cookingmanager.com/gluten-free-products-koshe-passover/ gluten-free]</ref>

===Cross-contamination issues===
A gluten-free diet allows for fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, and many dairy products. The diet allows rice, corn, soy, potato, tapioca, beans, sorghum, quinoa, millet, pure buckwheat, arrowroot, amaranth, teff, Montina, and nut flours and the diet prohibits the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, and related components, including triticale, durum, graham, kamut, semolina, spelt, malt, malt flavouring, or malt vinegar.<ref>American Dietetic Association: Hot topics: gluten-free diets www.eatright.org/search.aspx? Dec. 2009</ref>

In the United States, the FDA considers foods containing less than or equal to 20 ppm to be gluten-free,<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/FoodLabelingGuidanceRegulatoryInformation/Topic-SpecificLabelingInformation/ucm265309.htm</ref> but there is no regulation or law in the U.S. for labeling foods as 'gluten-free'. The finding of a current study indicates that some inherently gluten-free grains, seed, and flours not labeled gluten-free are contaminated with gluten. The consumption of these products can lead to inadvertent gluten intake.<ref>Journal of the American Dietetic Association. June 2010;939</ref>
The use of highly sensitive assays is mandatory to certify gluten-free food products. The European Union, World Health Organization, and Codex Alimentarius require reliable measurement of the wheat prolamins, gliadins rather than all-wheat proteins.<ref>Codex Alimentarius (2003) Draft revised standards for gluten-free foods, report of the 25th session of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, November 2003</ref>

There still is no general agreement on the analytical method used to measure gluten in ingredients and food products.<ref>Hischenhuber C,  Crevel R, Jarry B, Makai M, Moneret-Vautrin DA, Romano A, Troncone R, Ward R (2006) Review article: safe amounts of gluten for patients with wheat allergy or coeliac disease.  Aliment Pharmacol Ther 23(5):5590575</ref>
The official limits described in the Codex Draft are 20 ppm for foodstuffs that are considered naturally gluten-free and 200 ppm for foodstuffs rendered gluten-free.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.aca.2005.07.023}}</ref> The ELISA method was designed to detect w-gliadins, but it suffered from the setback that it lacked sensitivity for barley prolamins.<ref>{{cite pmid|14744677}}</ref>

Restaurants with gluten-free menus obviously recognize the importance of providing such a service, but those who are gluten-sensitive always must aware that the variety of procedures used in kitchens and grills may allow cross contamination to occur. This especially is the case in buffets where utensils typically are used in different food bowls by customers.

===Cross-contamination problems ===
A growing body of evidence suggests that a majority of people with celiac disease and following a gluten-free diet can safely consume pure oats in moderate amounts. Studies have indicated, however, that the commercial oat supply in Canada and other countries is contaminated with other grains.<ref>Taylor and Francis Online: Gluten contamination in the Canadian  commercial oat supply</ref>

Special care is necessary when checking product ingredient lists since gluten comes in many forms: vegetable proteins and starch, modified food starch (when derived from wheat instead of maize), malt flavoring, including maltodextrine, dextrine, unless specifically labeled as corn malt. Many ingredients contain wheat or barley derivatives. Dextrose is considered gluten-free, however, since it is highly modified, no matter what the source.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gluten Free Living|url=http://glutenfreeliving.com/ingredient.php#maltodextrin Ingredients|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}</ref>

====Controversy over oats====
{{Further2|[[Gluten sensitivity#The oat controversy|The oat controversy]] and [[Oat sensitivity]]}}
[[Image:Haverkorrels_Avena_sativa.jpg#file|thumb|250px|[[Oats|Oat]] grains in their husks]]
The suitability of [[oat]]s in the gluten-free diet is still somewhat controversial. Some research suggests that oats in themselves are [[gluten-free]], but that they are virtually always contaminated by other grains during distribution or processing. Recent research,<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> however, indicated that a protein naturally found in oats ([[avenin]]) possessed peptide sequences closely resembling wheat gluten and caused mucosal inflammation in significant numbers of celiac disease sufferers. Some examination results show that even oats that are not contaminated with wheat particles are nonetheless dangerous, while not very harmful to the majority. Such oats are generally considered risky for children with celiac disease to eat, but two studies show that they are completely safe for adults with celiac disease to eat. 

People who merely are "gluten-sensitive" may be able to eat oats without adverse effect,<ref>{{cite journal

Unless manufactured in a dedicated facility and under gluten-free practices, all cereal grains, including oats, may be cross-contaminated with gluten. Grains become contaminated with gluten by sharing the same farm, truck, mill, or bagging facility as wheat and other gluten-containing grains.

===Accuracy of "gluten-free" labels===
[[Image:Sixteen sausages wooden bowl.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sausage]]s may contain gluten via fillers or binders such as [[Rusk#Butcher's rusk|Butcher's Rusk]]]]
Standards for "gluten-free" labelling have been set up by the "[[Codex Alimentarius]]"; however, these regulations do not apply to "foods which in their normal form do not contain gluten".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/291/CXS_118e.pdf|publisher=[[Codex Alimentarius]]|title=Codex Standard For "Gluten-Free Foods" CODEX STAN 118-1981|date=February 22, 2006|format=PDF}}</ref>

The legal definition of the phrase "gluten-free" varies from country to country. Current research suggests that for persons with celiac disease the maximum safe level of gluten in a finished product is probably less than 0.02% (200 parts per million) and possibly as little as 0.002% (20 parts per million).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Australian standards reserve the "gluten-free" label for foods with less than 5 parts per million of gluten, as this is the smallest amount currently detectable. In the processing of gluten-containing grains, gluten is removed (shown in the processing flow below)

{{quotation|Wheat Flour ''(80,000ppm)''  >  Wheat Starch ''(200ppm)''  >  Dextrin  >  Maltodextrin  >  Glucose Syrup ''(<5ppm)''  >  Dextrose  >  Caramel Color}}

Since ordinary wheat flour contains approximately 12% gluten,<ref name=Spersud2008>{{cite book | last = Spersud | first = Erik and Jennifer | title = Everything You Want To Know About Recipes And Restaurants And Much More | publisher = [[Authorhouse]] | date = January 3, 2008 | location = USA | pages = 172 | url = http://glutenfreeenterprises.com/index.html | doi = 10.1007/b62130 | isbn = 978-1-4343-6034-2}}</ref> even a tiny amount of wheat flour can cross-contaminate a gluten-free product, therefore, considerable care must be taken to prevent cross-contamination in both commercial and home food preparation.

A gluten-free diet rules out all ordinary [[bread]]s, [[pasta]]s, and many [[convenience food]]s; it also excludes gravies, custards, soups, and sauces thickened with wheat, rye, barley, or other gluten-containing flour. Many countries do not require labeling of gluten containing products, but in several countries (especially [[Australia]] and the [[European Union]]) new product labeling standards are enforcing the labeling of gluten-containing ingredients. Various gluten-free bakery and pasta products are available from specialty retailers.

In the United States, gluten may not be listed on the labels of certain foods because the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] has classified gluten as [[GRAS]] (Generally Recognized As Safe).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1322|title= Sec. 184.1322 Wheat gluten|publisher= Code of Federal Regulations Center|author= |date= April 1, 2007}}</ref> Requirements for proper labeling are being formulated by the USDA. It is currently up to the manufacturers of "gluten-free" food items to guarantee such a claim. "A final rule that defines the term gluten-free and identifies the criteria that would enable the food industry to use that term" was scheduled to be released by the FDA on August 2, 2008.<ref>{{cite web

For now, many individuals who must eat gluten-free diets use sources online to search the gluten-free content of products.

Many so-called gluten-free products, such as chicken bouillon, corn cereal, and caramel ice cream topping, have been found to have been contaminated with gluten.<ref>{{cite web

Lastly, some non-foodstuffs such as [[medication]]s and [[vitamin]] [[dietary supplement|supplements]], especially those in [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form, may contain gluten as an [[excipient]] or binding agent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipecamericas.org/public/faqs.html#question4|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=[http://www.ipecamericas.org/ IPC Americas Inc]|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-04-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080411172805/http://www.ipecamericas.org/public/faqs.html#question4 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glutenfreedrugs.com/Excipients.htm|title=Excipient Ingredients in Medications|date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=2008-04-15|publisher=[http://www.glutenfreedrugs.com Gluten Free Drugs]}}</ref> People with gluten intolerances may therefore require specialist [[compounding]] of their medication.<ref name="Spersud2008"/>

===Alcoholic beverages===
[[Image:Glutenfreies Bier.jpg|thumb|[[Gluten-free beer]]]]

Several celiac disease groups report that according to the [[American Dietetic Association]]'s "Manual of Clinical Dietetics",<ref>[http://www.enabling.org/ia/celiac/ada.html "ADA Publishes Revised GF Diet Guidelines"]</ref><ref>[http://www.celiac.com/articles/11/1/Which-alcoholic-beverages-are-safe/Page1.html "Which alcoholic beverages are safe?" Celiac.com]</ref> many types of alcoholic beverages are considered gluten-free, provided no colourings or other additives have been added as these ingredients may contain gluten. Although most forms of whiskey are distilled from a [[mashing|mash]] that includes grains that contain gluten, [[distillation]] removes any proteins present in the mash, including gluten. Although up to 49% of the mash for [[Bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]] and up to 20% of the mash for [[corn whiskey]] may be made up of wheat, or rye, all-corn Bourbons and corn whiskeys do exist, and are generally labeled as such. Spirits made without any grain such as [[brandy]], [[wine]], [[mead]], [[cider]], [[sherry]], [[port wine|port]], [[rum]], [[tequila]], and [[vermouth]] generally do not contain gluten, although some vineyards use a flour paste to caulk the oak barrels in which wine is aged,<ref>StaVin Barrel Inserts Inc. [http://www.stavin.com/barrelsystems/insert.htm] Retrieved on 05/18/2009</ref> and other vineyards use gluten as a clarifying agent (though it is unclear whether gluten remains at the end of the clarification process).<ref>WSU Extension Manual "A Guide to the Fining of Wine" [http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/em016/em016.pdf] Retrieved on 3/18/10</ref><ref>Evaluation of residual immunoreactivity in red and white wines clarified with gluten or gluten derivatives [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14518594] Retrieved on 3/18/10</ref> Therefore, some celiac disease patients may wish to exercise caution. [[Liqueur]]s and pre-mixed drinks should be examined carefully for gluten-derived ingredients.

People diagnosed with celiac disease may experience symptoms when drinking distilled alcoholic beverages. Therefore, it is advised that a person with celiac disease check with a manufacturer about the ingredients that have been used in a hard liquor, and to proceed with caution if choosing to drink a liquor that is made with wheat, barley, oats, or rye.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Almost all beers are brewed with malted [[barley]] or [[wheat]] and will contain gluten. [[Sorghum]] and [[buckwheat]]-based [[gluten-free beer]]s are available, but remain a niche market. Some low-gluten beers are also available, however, there is disagreement over the use of gluten products in brewed beverages: Some brewers argue that the proteins from such grains as [[barley]] or [[wheat]] are converted into [[amino acid]]s during the [[brewing]] process and are therefore gluten-free;<ref>{{cite web| year = 2006| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20060513235929/http://www.celiac.com/st_prod.html?p_prodid=413| title = Is Beer Gluten-Free and Safe for People with Coeliac Disease?| publisher = Celiac.com}}

=== Gluten-free bread ===
[[File:Japanese Rice Bread.JPG|thumb|[[rice bread]]]]
[[Bread]], which is a staple in most diets, typically is made from grains such as wheat, that contain gluten. Wheat gluten contributes to the elasticity of dough and is thus an important component of bread. Gluten-free bread is made with ground flours from a variety of materials such as [[almond]]s, [[rice]] ([[rice bread]]), [[sorghum]] ([[sorghum bread]]), [[corn]] ([[cornbread]]), or legumes such as [[bean]]s ([[bean bread]]), but since these flours lack gluten it can be difficult for them to retain their shape as they rise and they may be less "fluffy". Additives such as [[xanthum gum]], [[hydroxypropyl methylcellulose]] (HPMC), [[corn starch]], or [[egg (food)|eggs]] are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.<ref>Schober TJ, Bean SR. [http://www.csaceliacs.org/documents/Gluten-freebaking_000.pdf Gluten-free baking: what is happening inside the bread?] USDA.</ref>

==Popularity and nonceliac health effects ==
Gluten-free [[fad diet]]s have become popular. This may be because celiac disease was underdiagnosed and also that people are "unnecessary turning to the diets as a food fad". There also appears to be an increased incidence of celiac disease, with one study which looked for antibodies from 1950s American blood samples finding that celiac disease is about four times as common as it was.<ref name=CBS>http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57483789-10391704/gluten-free-diet-fad-are-celiac-disease-rates-actually-rising/</ref> Many are adopting gluten-free diets to treat celiac disease-like symptoms in the absence of a positive test for celiac disease. 

A 2011 panel of celiac experts concluded that there is a condition related to gluten other than celiac disease and named it "non-celiac [[gluten sensitivity]]".<ref>[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/gluten-free-whether-you-need-it-or-not/ Gluten-Free, Whether You Need It or Not].

Some of them are confusing and ambiguous. "Non-celiac gluten sensitivity" or "non-coeliac gluten sensitivity" is the recommended umbrella term for conditions where symptoms different from celiac disease result from ingestion of gluten.<ref name=Gut021612>{{cite journal|coauthors=Daniel A Leffler, Julio C Bai, Federico Biagi, Alessio Fasano, Peter H R Green, Marios Hadjivassiliou, Katri Kaukinen, Ciaran P Kelly, Jonathan N Leonard, Knut Erik Aslaksen Lundin, Joseph A Murray, David S Sanders, Marjorie M Walker, Fabiana Zingone, Carolina Ciacci|title=The Oslo definitions for coeliac disease and related terms|journal=Gut|date=February 16, 2012|volume=62|issue=1|pages=43–52|doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301346|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/62/1/43.full.pdf|accessdate=February 5, 2013|author=Jonas F Ludvigsson|publisher=BMJ and British Society of Gastroenterology|quote=CD was defined as ‘a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals’. Classical CD was defined as ‘CD presenting with signs and symptoms of malabsorption.

==Deficiencies linked to maintaining a gluten-free diet==

Many gluten-free products are not fortified or enriched by such nutrients as folate, iron, and fiber as traditional breads and cereals have been during the last century.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Additionally, because gluten-free products are not always available, many Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy (GSE) patients do not consume the recommended number of grain servings per day. People who change their standard gluten-free diet to implement gluten-free oats at breakfast, high fiber brown rice bread at lunch, and quinoa as a side at dinner have been found to have significant increases in protein (20.6 g versus 11 g), iron (18.4&nbsp;mg versus 1.4&nbsp;mg), calcium (182&nbsp;mg versus 0&nbsp;mg), and fiber (12.7 g versus 5 g). The B vitamin group did not have significant increases, but were still found to have improved values of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folate.<ref>

Oats can increase intakes of vitamin B1, magnesium, and zinc in celiac disease patients in remission.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/ejcn.2009.113}}</ref>
