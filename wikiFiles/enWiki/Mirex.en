'''Mirex''' is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that was commercialized as an [[insecticide]] and later banned because of its impact on the environment. This white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of [[cyclopentadiene]].   It was popularized to control [[fire ants]] but by virtue of its chemical robustness and [[lipophilicity]] it was recognized as a [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulative]] pollutant. Ironically, the spread of the [[red imported fire ant]] was actually encouraged by the use of Mirex, which also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] prohibited its use in 1976.<ref name=Ullmann>Robert L. Metcalf “Insect Control” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry” Wiley-VCH, Wienheim, 2002.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}</ref>

==Production and applications==
Mirex was first reported in 1946 by Prins<ref>{{cite journal

Mirex is a stomach insecticide. The insecticidal use was focused on Southeastern United States to control the imported [[fire ant]]s ''Solenopsis saevissima richteri'' and ''Solenopsis invicta''. Approximately 250,000&nbsp;kg of mirex was applied to fields between 1962-75 (US NRC, 1978).  Most of the mirex was in the form of "4X mirex bait," which consists of 0.3% mirex in 14.7% [[soybean oil]] mixed with 85% [[corncob]] grits. Application of the 4X bait was designed to give a coverage of 4.2 g mirex/ha and was delivered by aircraft, helicopter or tractor. 1x and 2x bait were also used. Use of mirex as a pesticide was banned in 1978.  The [[Stockholm Convention]] banned production and use of several [[persistent organic pollutant]] and Mirex was one of the "dirty dozen."<ref>Kaiser KL, The rise and fall of Mirex. Environ.Sci.Technol.1978, 12, 520-528</ref>

==Degradation==
Characteristic of chlorocarbons, mirex does not burn easily; combustion products are expected to include [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[chlorine]], [[phosgene]], and other organochlorine species.  Slow oxidation produces [[chlordecone]] ("Kepone"), a related insecticide that is also banned in most of the western world. but more readily degraded. Sunlight degrades mirex to photomirex.<!--what is that?--><ref name=Ullmann/>

Mirex is highly resistant to microbiological degradation. It only slowly dechlorinates to a monohydro derivative by anaerobic microbial action in sewage sludge and by enteric bacteria. Degradation by soil microorganisms has not been described.

==Bioaccumulation and biomagnification ==
Mirex is highly cumulative and amount depends upon the concentration and  duration of exposure.
There is evidence of accumulation of mirex in aquatic and terrestrial food chains to harmful levels.  After 6 applications of mirex bait at 1.4&nbsp;kg/ha, high mirex levels were found in some species; turtle fat contained 24.8&nbsp;mg mirex/kg, kingfishers, 1.9&nbsp;mg/kg, coyote fat, 6&nbsp;mg/kg, opossum fat, 9.5&nbsp;mg/kg, and racoon fat, 73.9&nbsp;mg/kg.  In a model ecosystem with a terrestrial-aquatic interface, sorgum seedlings were treated with mirex at 1.1&nbsp;kg/ha. Caterpillars fed on these seedlings and their faeces contaminated the water which contained algae, snails, Daphnia,  mosquito larvae, and fish. After 33 days, the ecological magnification value was 219 for fish and 1165 for snails.  

Although general environmental levels are low, it is widespread in the biotic and abiotic environment. Being lipophilic, Mirex is strongly adsorbed on sediments<!--logical?-->.

==Safety==
Mirex is only moderately toxic in single-dose animal studies (oral {{LD50}} values range from 365&ndash;3000&nbsp;mg/kg body weight).<ref>EL-Bayomey AA, IW Somak, and S. Branch. Embryotoxicity of the pesticide Mirex In vitro. Teratogenesis, Carcinogenesis, and Mutagenesis 2002, 22:239-249.
</ref> It can enter the body via inhalation, ingestion, and via the skin. The most sensitive effects of repeated exposure in animals are principally associated with the liver, and these effects have been observed with doses as low as 1.0&nbsp;mg/kg diet (0.05&nbsp;mg/kg body weight per day), the lowest dose tested. At higher dose levels, it is fetotoxic (25&nbsp;mg/kg in diet) and teratogenic (6.0&nbsp;mg/kg per day). Mirex was not generally active in short-term tests for genetic activity. There is sufficient evidence of its carcinogenicity in mice and rats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Delayed onset of toxic effects and mortality is typical of mirex poisoning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Mirex is toxic for a range of aquatic organisms, with crustacea being particularly sensitive.

Mirex induces pervasive chronic physiological and biochemical disorders in various vertebrates.  No acceptable daily intake (ADI) for Mirex has been advised by FAO/WHO.  IARC (1979) evaluated the carcinogenic hazard resulting from exposure to mirex and concluded that "there is sufficient evidence for its carcinogenicity to mice and rats. In the absence of adequate data in humans, based on above result it can be said that it has  carcinogenic risk to humans”.  Data on human health effects do not exist.
