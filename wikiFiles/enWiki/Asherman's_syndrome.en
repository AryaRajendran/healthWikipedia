'''Asherman's syndrome''' (AS) or '''Fritsch syndrome''', is a condition characterized by adhesions and/or fibrosis of the endometrium most often associated with dilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity.<ref name="Williams">{{cite book|last= Schorge|first=John O. et al|title=Williams Gynecology|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=9780071472579}}</ref>  A number of other terms have been used to describe the condition and related conditions including: [[injurious intrauterine adhesions]], uterine/[[cervical atresia]], [[traumatic uterine atrophy]], [[sclerotic endometrium]], [[endometrial sclerosis]], and intrauterine synechiae.<ref name="Palter" />

== Causes and features ==
[[Image:HSG Ashermans syndrome.jpg|thumb|[[Hysterosalpingography|HSG]] view. Note: not the same uterus as in ultrasound or hysteroscopic view; this uterus appears to be T-shaped.]]
[[Image:Hysteroscopy of Asherman's Syndrome.jpg|thumb|[[Hysteroscopy|Hysteroscopic]] view.]]
The cavity of the [[uterus]] is lined by the [[endometrium]]. This lining is composed of two layers, the [[Endometrium#Histology|functional layer]] (adjacent to the uterine cavity) which is shed during [[menstruation]] and an [[Endometrium#Histology|underlying basal layer]] (adjacent to the myometrium), which is necessary for regenerating the [[Endometrium#Histology|functional layer]]. Trauma to the basal layer, typically after a [[dilation and curettage]] (D&C) performed after a [[miscarriage]], or [[childbirth|delivery]], or for medical [[abortion]], can lead to the development of intrauterine scars resulting in [[adhesions]] that can obliterate the cavity to varying degrees. In the extreme, the whole cavity can be scarred and occluded. Even with relatively few scars, the [[endometrium]] may fail to respond to [[estrogen]]. Often, patients experience secondary menstrual irregularities characterized by a decrease in flow and duration of bleeding ([[amenorrhea]], [[hypomenorrhea]], or [[oligomenorrhea]])<ref name="Klein">{{cite journal |author=Klein SM, Garcia C-R |title=Asherman's syndrome: a critique and current review |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=722–735. |year=1973 |pmid=4725610 |doi=}}</ref> and become [[infertile]]. [[Menstrual]] anomalies are often but not always correlated with severity: adhesions restricted to only the [[cervix]] or lower [[uterus]] may block [[menstruation]]. Pain during [[menstruation]] and [[ovulation]] is also sometimes experienced and can be attributed to blockages.
It has been reported that 88% of AS occur after a [[dilation and curettage|D&C]] is performed on a recently [[pregnant]] [[uterus]], following a missed or incomplete [[miscarriage]], [[birth]], or during an elective termination ([[abortion]]) to remove [[wiktionary: products of conception|retained products of conception]].<ref name="Williams" /> It affects women of all races and ages equally, suggesting no underlying genetic predisposition for its development.<ref name="Schenker">{{cite journal |author=Schenker JG, Margalioth EJ. |title=Intra-uterine adhesions: an updated appraisal |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=593–610. |year=1982 |pmid=6281085

An artificial form of AS can be surgically induced by [[endometrial ablation]] in women with excessive uterine bleeding, in lieu of [[hysterectomy]].

==Incidence==
AS has been reported to result from 25% of D&Cs performed 1–4 weeks post-partum,<ref name="Buttram">{{cite journal |author=Buttram UC, Turati G. |title=Uterine synechiae: variation in severity and some conditions which may be conductive to severe adhesions |journal=Int J Fertil |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=98–103. |year=1977 |pmid=20418 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="Rochet Y, Dargent D, Bremond A, Priou G, Rudigoz RC 1979 723–726" /><ref>Parent B, Barbot J, Dubuisson JB.

</ref>

In the case of missed miscarriages, the time period between fetal demise and curettage may increase the likelihood of adhesion formation due to fibroblastic activity of the remaining tissue <ref name="Schenker" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fedele L, Bianchi S, Frontino G |title=Septums and synechiae: approaches to surgical correction |journal=Clin Obstet Gynecol |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=767–88 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17082672 |doi=10.1097/01.grf.0000211948.36465.a6 |url=}}</ref> 

The risk of AS also increases with the number of procedures: one study estimated the risk to be 16% after one D&C and 32% after 3 or more D&Cs,<ref name="Friedler">{{cite journal |author=Friedler S, Margalioth EJ, Kafka I, Yaffe H. |title=Incidence of postabortion intra-uterine adhesions evaluated by hysteroscopy: a prospective study |journal=Hum Reprod |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=442–444. |year=1993 |pmid=8473464|doi=}}</ref> however a single curettage often underlies the condition.

==Prevalence in the general population==
The true prevalence of AS is unclear as many doctors are unaware of the symptoms or diagnosis. It is estimated that up to 5% of D&Cs result in AS{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}. More conservative estimates put this rate at 1% {{citation needed|date=June 2009}}, however, this seems an underestimate given the incidence of IUA following curettage reported in prospective studies and the number of D&Cs performed annually.Increased awareness about the condition and its diagnosis is also expected to reveal a higher frequency than previously reported. The condition was found in 1.5% of women undergoing HSG,<ref name="Dmowski">{{cite journal |author=Dmowski WP, Greenblatt RB. |title=Asherman's syndrome and risk of placenta accreta |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=288–299. |year=1969 |pmid=5816312 |doi=}}

== Diagnosis ==
The history of a [[pregnancy]] event followed by a D&C leading to secondary amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea is typical. Hysteroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis.<ref name="Valle">Valle RF, Sciarra JJ. Intrauterine adhesions: hysteroscopic diagnosis, classification, treatment, and reproductive outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1988; 158:1459-1470.</ref> Imaging by [[sonohysterography]] or [[hysterosalpingography]] will reveal the extent of the scar formation. Ultrasound is not a reliable method of diagnosing Asherman's Syndrome. Hormone studies show normal levels consistent with reproductive function.

== Classification ==

Various classification systems were developed to describe Asherman’s syndrome (citations to be added), some taking into account the amount of functioning residual endometrium, menstrual pattern, obstetric history and other factors which are thought to play a role in determining the prognoses. With the advent of techniques which allow visualization of the uterus, classification systems were developed to take into account the location and severity of adhesions inside the uterus. This is useful as mild cases with adhesions restricted to the cervix may present with amenorrhea and infertility, showing that symptoms alone do not necessarily reflect severity. Other patients may have no adhesions but amenorrhea and infertility due to a sclerotic atrophic endometrium. The latter form has the worst prognosis.

== Treatment ==
Fertility may sometimes be restored by removal of adhesions, depending on the severity of the initial trauma and other individual patient factors. Operative [[hysteroscopy]] is used for visual inspection of the uterine cavity during adhesion dissection ([[adhesiolysis]]).However, hysteroscopy is yet to become a routine gynaecological procedure and only 15% of US gynecologists perform office hysteroscopy {Isaacson, 2002}. Adhesion dissection can be technically difficult and must be performed with care in order to not create new scars and further exacerbate the condition. In more severe cases, adjunctive measures such as laparoscopy are used in conjunction with hysteroscopy as a protective measure against uterine perforation. Microscissors are usually used to cut adhesions. Electrocauterization is not recommended.<ref name="Kodaman">{{cite journal |author=Kodaman PH, Arici AA. |title=Intra-uterine adhesions and fertility outcome: how to optimize success? |journal=Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=207–214. |year=2007 |pmid=17495635 |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e32814a6473}}

As IUA frequently reform after surgery, techniques have been developed to prevent recurrence of adhesions. Methods to prevent adhesion reformation include the use of mechanical barriers (Foley catheter, saline-filled [http://www.cookmedical.com/wh/dataSheet.do?id=4488 Cook Medical Balloon Uterine Stent], IUCD) and gel barriers (Seprafilm, Spraygel, autocrosslinked hyaluronic acid gel [[Hyalobarrier]]) to maintain opposing walls apart during healing {Tsapanos, 2002}; {Guida, 2004};{Abbott, 2004}, thereby preventing the reformation of adhesions. Antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in the presence of mechanical barriers to reduce the risk of possible infections. A common pharmacological method for preventing reformation of adhesions is sequential hormonal therapy with [[estrogen]] followed by a progestin to stimulate endometrial growth and prevent opposing walls from fusing together {Roge, 1996}. However there have been no RCTs comparing post-surgical adhesion reformation with and without hormonal treatment and the ideal dosing regimen or length of estrogen therapy is not known. The absence of prospective [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) comparing treatment methods makes it difficult to recommend optimal treatment protocols. Furthermore, diagnostic severity and outcomes are assessed according to different criteria (e.g. menstrual pattern, adhesion reformation rate, conception rate, live birth rate). Clearly, more comparable studies are needed in which reproductive outcome can be analysed systematically. 

Follow-up tests (HSG, hysteroscopy or SHG) are necessary to ensure that adhesions have not reformed. Further surgery may be necessary to restore a normal uterine cavity.
According to a recent study among 61 patients, the overall rate of adhesion recurrence was 27.9% and in severe cases this was 41.9%.<ref name="yu">{{cite journal |author=Yu D, Li T, Xia E, Huang X, Peng X. |title=Factors affecting reproductive outcome of hysteroscopic adhesiolysis for Asherman's syndrome |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=715–722 |year=2008 |pmid=17681324 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.03.070}}</ref> Another study found that postoperative adhesions reoccur in close to 50% of severe AS and in 21.6% of moederate cases.<ref name="Valle" /> Mild IUA, unlike moderate to severe synechiae, do not appear to reform.

== Prognosis ==
The extent of adhesion formation is critical. Mild to moderate adhesions can usually be treated with success. Extensive obliteration of the uterine cavity or fallopian tube openings ([[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostia]]) and deep endometrial or myometrial trauma may require several surgical interventions and/or hormone therapy or even be uncorrectable. If the uterine cavity is adhesion free but the ostia remain obliterated, [[IVF]] remains an option. If the uterus has been irreparably damaged, [[surrogacy]] or [[adoption]] may be the only options.

Patients who carry a [[pregnancy]] even after treatment of IUA may have an increased risk of having abnormal placentation including [[placenta accreta]]<ref name="Fernandez">{{cite journal |author=Fernandez H, Al Najjar F, Chauvenaud-Lambling et al. |title=Fertility after treatment of Asherman's syndrome stage 3 and 4 |journal=J Minim Invasive Gynecol |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=398–402. |year=2006 |pmid=16962521 |doi=10.1016/j.jmig.2006.04.013}}</ref> where the placenta invades the [[uterus]] more deeply, leading to complications in placental separation after delivery.

They may also develop [[incompetent cervix]] where the cervix can no longer support the growing weight of the fetus, the pressure causes the placenta to rupture and the mother goes into premature labour. [[Cerclage]] is a surgical stitch which helps support the cervix if needed.<ref name="Capella">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humrep/14.5.1230 | last1 = Capella-Allouc | first1 = S | last2 = Morsad | first2 = F | last3 = Rongieres-Bertrand | first3 = C | author-separator =, | last4 = Taylor | author-name-separator= | year = 1999 | first4 = S | last5 = Fernandez | first5 = H| title = Hysteroscopic treatment of severe Asherman's syndrome and subsequent fertility | url = | journal = Hum Reprod | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 1230–1233 | pmid = 10325268 }}</ref> 

Pregnancy and live birth rate has been reported to be related to the initial severity of the adhesions with 93, 78, and 57% pregnancies achieved after treatment of mild, moderate and severe adhesions, respectively and resulting in 81, 66, and 32% live birth rates, respectively.<ref name="Valle" /> The overall pregnancy rate after adhesiolysis was 60% and the live birth rate was 38.9% according to one study.<ref name="Siegler">{{cite journal |author=Siegler AM, Valle RF. |title=Therapeutic hysteroscopic procedures |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=685–701. |year=1988 |pmid=3053254 |doi=}}
</ref> 

Age is another factor contributing to fertility outcomes after treatment of AS. For women under 35 years of age treated for severe adhesions, pregnancy rates were 66.6% compared to 23.5% in women older than 35.<ref name="Fernandez">Fernandez H, Al-Najjar F, Chauveneaud-Lambling A, et al.

==Prevention==
The recently pregnant uterus is particularly soft under the influence of hormones and hence, easily injured. D&C (including dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation/suction curettage and manual vacuum aspiration) is a blind, invasive procedure, making it difficult to avoid endometrial trauma. Medical alternatives to D&C for evacuation of retained placenta/products of conception exist including [[misoprostol]] and mifepristone or RU486. Studies show this less invasive and cheaper method to be an efficacious, safe and an acceptable alternative to surgical management for most women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang J, Gilles JM, Barnhart K, Creinin MD, Westhoff C, Frederick MM |title= National Institute of Child Health Human Development (NICHD) Management of Early Pregnancy Failure Trial.

So far, one study supports this proposal, showing that women who were treated for missed miscarriage with misoprostol did not develop IUA, while 7.7% of those undergoing D&C did.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tam WH, Lau WC, Cheung LP, Yuen PM, Chung TK. |title=Intrauterine adhesions after conservative and surgical management of spontaneous abortion |journal=J Am Assoc Gynecol Laparosc. |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=182–185 |year=2002 |pmid=11960045 |doi=10.1016/S1074-3804(05)60129-6}}</ref> The advantage of misoprostol is that it can be used for evacuation not only following miscarriage, but also following birth for retained placenta or hemorrhaging. 

Alternatively, D&C could be performed under ultrasound guidance rather than as a blind procedure. This would enable the surgeon to end scraping the lining when all retained tissue has been removed, avoiding injury. 

Early monitoring during pregnancy to identify miscarriage can prevent the development of, or as the case may be, the recurrence of AS, as the longer the period after fetal death following D&C, the more likely adhesions may be to occur.<ref name="Schenker">Friedler S, Margalioth EJ, Kafka I, Yaffe H. Incidence of postabortion intra-uterine adhesions evaluated by husteroscopy: a prospective study. Hum Reprod 1993;8:442-444.</ref> Therefore immediate evacuation following fetal death may prevent IUA. 

The use of hysteroscopic surgery instead of D&C to remove retained products of conception or placenta is another alternative, although it could be less effective if tissue is abundant. Also, hysteroscopy is not a widely or routinely used technique and requires expertise. 

There is no data to indicate that suction D&C is less likely than sharp curette to result in Asherman's. A recent article describes three cases of women who developed intrauterine adhesions following manual vacuum aspiration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dalton VK, Saunders NA, Harris LH, Williams JA, Lebovic DI|title=Intrauterine adhesions after manual vacuum aspiration for early pregnancy failure|journal=Fertil.
