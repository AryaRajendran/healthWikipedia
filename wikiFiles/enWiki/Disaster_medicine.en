'''Disaster medicine''' is the area of [[physician]] medical specialization serving the dual areas of providing [[health care]] to [[disaster]] survivors and providing medically related [[disaster preparation]], [[disaster planning]], [[disaster response]] and [[disaster recovery]] leadership throughout the [[disaster life cycle]]. Disaster medicine specialists provide insight, guidance and expertise on the principles and practice of medicine both in the disaster impact area and healthcare evacuation receiving facilities to [[emergency management]] professionals, hospitals, healthcare facilities, communities and governments. The disaster medicine specialist is the liaison between and partner to the [[medical contingency planner]], the emergency management professional, the [[incident command system]], government and policy makers.

Disaster medicine is unique among the medical specialties in that unlike all other areas of specialization, the disaster medicine specialist does not practice the full scope of the specialty everyday but only in emergencies. Indeed, the disaster medicine specialist hopes to never practice the full scope of skills required for board certification. However, like the specialists in [[public health]], [[environmental medicine]] and [[occupational medicine]]; disaster medicine specialists engage in the development and modification of public and private policy, legislation, disaster planning and disaster recovery. Within the United State of America, the specialty of disaster medicine fulfils the requirements set for by [[Homeland Security Presidential Directive]]s (HSPD), the [[National Response Plan]] (NRP), the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS), the [[National Resource Typing System]] (NRTS) and the [[NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities]].

Bush Administration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Disaster behavioral health]] – Disaster behavioral health deals with the capability of disaster responders to perform optimally, and for disaster survivors to maintain or rapidly restore function, when faced with the threat or actual impact of disasters and extreme events.<ref name="Shultz 2006">Shultz et al. 2006. Surge, Sort, Support: Disaster Behavioral Health for Healthcare Professionals. Orlando: Disaster Life Support Publishing, Inc.</ref>

[[Disaster law]] – Disaster law deals with the legal ramifications of disaster planning, preparedness, response and recovery, including but not limited to financial recovery, public and private liability, property abatement and condemnation.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ramirez, M. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning seminar, September, 2007</ref>

[[Disaster life cycle]] – The time line for disaster events beginning with the period between disasters (interphase), progressing through the disaster event and the disaster response and culminating in the disaster recovery. Interphase begins as the end of the last disaster recovery and ends at the onset of the next disaster event. The disaster event begins when the event occurs and ends when the immediate event subsides. The disaster response begins when the event occurs and ends when acute disaster response services are no longer needed. Disaster recovery also begins with the disaster response and continues until the affected area is returned to the pre-event condition.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Disaster planning]] – The act of devising a methodology for dealing with a disaster event, especially one with the potential to occur suddenly and cause great injury and/or loss of life, damage and hardship. Disaster planning occurs during the disaster interphase.<ref name="ReferenceB">Marghella, P. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning seminar, September, 2007</ref>

[[Disaster preparation]] – The act of practicing and implementing the plan for dealing with a disaster event before and event occurs, especially one with the potential to occur suddenly and cause great injury and/or loss of life, damage and hardship. Disaster preparation occurs during the disaster interphase.<ref>Marghella, P. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning Seminar, september, 2007</ref>

[[Disaster recovery]] – The restoration or return to the former or better state or condition proceeding a disaster event (i.e., status quo ante, the state of affairs that existed previously). Disaster recovery is the fourth phase of the disaster life cycle.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[Disaster response]] – The ability to answer the intense challenges posed by a disaster event. Disaster response is the third phase of the disaster life cycle.<ref name="ReferenceC">Marghella, P. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning Seminar, September, 2007</ref>

== History ==

The term “disaster medicine” first appeared in the medical lexicon in the post World War II era. Although coined by former and current military physicians who had served in World War II, the term grow out of a concern for the need to care for military casualties, or nuclear holocaust victims{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, but out of the need to provide care to the survivors of natural disasters and the not yet distant memory of the 1917-1918 Influenza Pandemic.

The term “disaster medicine” would continue to appear sporadically in both the medical and popular press{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} until the 1980s when the first concerted efforts to organize a medical response corps for disasters grew into the [[National Disaster Medical System]]. Simultaneous with this was the formation of a disaster and [[emergency medicine]] discussion and study group under the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) in the United States as well as groups in Great Britain, Israel and other countries. By the time hurricane Andrew struck Florida in 1992, the concept of disaster medicine was entrenched in public and governmental consciousness. Although training and fellowships in disaster medicine or related topics began graduating specialists in the Europe and the United States as early as the 1980s, it would not be until 2003 however that the medical community would embrace the need for the new specialty{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

Throughout this period, incomplete and faltering medical responses to disaster events made it increasingly apparent{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} in the United States of America that federal, state and local emergency management organizations were in need of a mechanism to identify qualified physicians in the face of a global upturn in the rate of disasters{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  Many physicians who volunteer at disasters have a bare minimum of knowledge in disaster medicine and often pose a hazard to themselves and the response effort because they have little or no field response training. It was against this backdrop that the [[American Academy of Disaster Medicine]] (AADM) and the [[American Board of Disaster Medicine]] (ABODM) were formed in the United States of America for the purpose of scholarly exchange and education in Disaster Medicine as well as the development of an examination demonstrating excellence towards [[board certification]] in this new specialty.

For the first time in NDMS history, the entire NDMS system is deployed for a single disaster medical response. Among the many lessons learned in field operations following hurricane Katrina are the need for cellular autonomy under a central incident command structure and the creation of [[continuous integrated triage]] for the management of massive patient surge. The lessons learned in the hurricane Katrina response would be applied less than a month later following hurricane Rita and again following hurricane Wilma and the Indonesian tsunami.

2005 – In late October, 2005, the [[American Board of Disaster Medicine]] (ABODM) and the [[American Academy of Disaster Medicine]] (AADM) were formed for scholarly study, discussion and exchange in the field of disaster medicine as well as to oversee board certification in disaster medicine.

2007 – On September 30, 2007, the NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities compliance deadline passes with fewer than 9% of all United States hospitals fully compliant and fewer than half of hospitals and healthcare facilities having made substantial progress towards compliance.

2007 – On October 18, 2007, President Bush issues HSPD-21 outlining an augmented plan for public health and disaster medical preparedness. HSPD-21 specifically calls for the creation of the discipline of “disaster healthcare” using the accepted definition of “disaster medicine.” HSPD-21 also calls on the Secretary of [[Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to use “economic incentives’’ including the [[Center for Medicare Services]] (CMS) to induce private medical organizations, hospitals and healthcare facilities to implement disaster healthcare programs and medical disaster preparedness programs.<ref name="fas.org"/>

==  Board certification ==

Physicians who hold board certification in disaster medicine have demonstrated by written and simulator based examination that through training and field experience they have mastered the spectrum of knowledge and skills which defines the specialty of disaster medicine. As with all medical specialties, this body of knowledge and skills is contained in the [[core competencies]] document created and maintained by the American Board of Disaster Medicine and the American Academy of Disaster Medicine. As with all core competencies document, the specific knowledge and skills required for certification are subject to constant refinement and evolution. This statement cannot be more true than for a specialty like disaster medicine where the nature of the threats faced, the responses undertaken and the lessons learned become more complex with each event.
