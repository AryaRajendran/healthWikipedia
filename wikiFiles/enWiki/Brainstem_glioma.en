A '''brainstem glioma''' is a cancerous [[glioma]] tumor in the [[brainstem]].

Around 75% are diagnosed in children and young adults under the age of twenty, but have been known to affect older adults as well.<ref name="eMedicine">{{cite web|last=Landolfi|first=Joseph|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1156030-overview|publisher=eMedicine|accessdate=15 August 2010|date=30|month=June|year=2009|title=Brainstem Gliomas}}</ref> Brainstem gliomas start in the brain or spinal cord tissue and typically spread throughout the nervous system.<ref name="pmid18293027">{{cite journal |author=Salmaggi A, Fariselli L, Milanesi I, ''et al.'' |title=Natural history and management of brainstem gliomas in adults. A retrospective Italian study |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=255 |issue=2 |pages=171–7 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18293027 |doi=10.1007/s00415-008-0589-0}}</ref> Brainstem gliomas are often primary [[brain tumor]]s, and rarely [[metastasize]], or spread, to affect another part of the body.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Cause==
The cause is still unknown. Researchers have not found any direct genetic link. Children irradiated for [[tinea capitis]] have been found to have an increased risk for other central nervous system tumors, such as meningiomas, gliomas, and nerve sheath tumors, but not necessarily tumors of the brain stem.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms include, but are not necessarily limited to:
*Lack of facial control, (droopy eyelids)
*Double vision
*Headache or headache that gets better after vomiting
*Nausea and vomiting
*Weakness and fatigue
*Seizures
*Balance problems

Symptoms can develop slowly and subtly and may go unnoticed for months. In other cases, the symptoms may arise abruptly. A sudden onset of symptoms tends to occur with more rapidly growing, high-grade tumors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Diagnosis==
Neuroimaging, such as MRI, is the main diagnostic tool for brain stem gliomas. In very rare cases, surgery and biopsy are performed.

==Treatment==
Unlike most brain tumors, brainstem glioma is not often treated with [[neurosurgery]] due to complications in vital parts of the brain. More often, it is treated with [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiation therapy]] (though past use of radiation therapy has yielded mixed results.)<ref name="pmid16463390">{{cite journal |author=Broniscer A, Laningham FH, Kocak M, ''et al.'' |title=Intratumoral hemorrhage among children with newly diagnosed, diffuse brainstem glioma |journal=Cancer |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1364–71 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16463390 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21749}}</ref>

There are several new clinical trials in process. One such trial is dendritic cell immunotherapy which uses the patient’s tumor cells and white blood cells to produce a chemotherapy that directly attacks the tumor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

However, these treatments do produce side effects; most often including nausea, the breakdown of the immune system, and fatigue. Hair loss can occur from both chemotherapy and radiation, but usually grows back after chemotherapy has ceased. [[Steroid]]s such as [[Dexamethasone|Decadron]] may be required to treat swelling in the brain. Decadron can lead to weight gain and infection. Patients may also experience seizures, which need to be treated to avoid complications. For some patients there is a chance of a neurological break down, this can include, but is not limited to, confusion and memory loss.

The use of [[topotecan]] has been investigated.<ref name="pmid12626128">{{cite journal |author=Sanghavi SN, Needle MN, Krailo MD, Geyer JR, Ater J, Mehta MP |title=A phase I study of topotecan as a radiosensitizer for brainstem glioma of childhood: first report of the Children's Cancer Group-0952 |journal=Neuro-oncology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=8–13 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12626128 |pmc=1920667 |doi= 10.1215/15228517-5-1-8|url=http://neuro-oncology.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12626128 |format={{dead link|date=May 2010}}}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Brainstem glioma is an aggressive and dangerous cancer.  Without treatment, the life expectancy is typically a few months from the time of diagnosis.  With appropriate treatment, 37% survive more than one year, 20% survive 2 years. and 13% survive 3 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
