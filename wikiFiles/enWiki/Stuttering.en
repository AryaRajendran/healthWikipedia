'''Stuttering''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ʌ|t|ər|ɪ|ŋ}}; ''alalia syllabaris''), also known as '''stammering''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|æ|m|ər|ɪ|ŋ}}; ''alalia literalis'' or ''anarthria literalis''), is a [[speech disorder]] in which the flow of [[speech]] is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds.<ref>[http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf90.htm+f985 World Health Organization ICD-10 F95.8 - Stuttering].</ref> The term ''stuttering'' is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as ''blocks'', and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually [[vowel]]s and [[semivowel]]s. For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem. Blocks and prolongations are learned mechanisms to mask repetition, as the fear of repetitive speaking in public is often the main cause of psychological unease. The term "stuttering" covers a wide range of severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent oral communication. 

The impact of stuttering on a person's functioning and emotional state can be severe. This may include fears of having to [[elocution|enunciate]] specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, or a feeling of "loss of control" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly associated with anxiety but there is actually no such correlation (though as mentioned social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Stuttering is not reflective of [[intelligence]].<ref>[http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.aspx?tabid=539 Myths about stuttering], on [[Stuttering Foundation of America|Stuttering Foundation]]'s website.</ref>

Stuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words.  Acute nervousness and stress can trigger stuttering in persons predisposed to it, and living with a highly stigmatized disability can result in [[anxiety]] and high [[Allostatic load|allostatic stress load]] (''i.e.'', chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem in the manner of a [[positive feedback]] system; the name 'Stuttered Speech Syndrome' has been proposed for this condition.<ref>http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Irwin | first=M |editor1-first=J| editor1-last=Au-Yeung |editor2-first=MM| editor2-last=Leahy |title=Research, Treatment, and Self-Help in Fluency Disorders: New Horizons |publisher=The International Fluency Association |year=2006 |pages=41–45 |url=http://stutteredspeechsyndrome.com/for-academics-clinicians/terminology Terminology – How Should Stuttering be Defined? and Why? |isbn=978-0-9555700-1-8}}</ref> Neither acute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to stuttering.

The disorder is also ''variable'', which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending on the anxiety level connected with that activity. Although the exact [[etiology]] or cause of stuttering is unknown, both [[genetics]] and [[neurophysiology]] are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and [[speech therapy]] techniques available that may help increase [[fluency]] in some people who stutter to the point where an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22065298|last1=Ashurst|first1=JV|last2=Wasson|first2=MN |title=Developmental and persistent developmental stuttering: an overview for primary care physicians.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=111 |issue=10 |pages=576–580 |year=2011|month=October|pmid=22065298}}</ref>

==Classification==
Developmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood. Other disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include [[Asperger's syndrome]], [[cluttering]], [[Motor symptoms parkinson's disease|Parkinson's speech]], [[essential tremor]], [[palilalia]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[selective mutism]], and [[social anxiety]].

==Characteristics==

===Primary behaviors===
Primary stuttering behaviors are the overt, observable signs of speech fluency breakdown, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. These differ from the normal disfluencies found in all speakers in that stuttering disfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain.<ref name="Ward5–6">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=5–6}}</ref> Stuttering disfluencies also vary in quality: normal disfluencies tend to be a repetition of words, phrases or parts of phrases, while stuttering is characterized by prolongations, blocks and part-word repetitions.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalinowski|2006|pp=31–37}}</ref>
*'''Repetition''' occurs when a ''unit of speech'', such as a sound, syllable, word, or phrase is repeated and are typical in children who are beginning to stutter. For example, "to-to-to-tomorrow".
*'''Prolongations''' are the unnatural lengthening of [[continuant]] sounds, for example,"mmmmmmmmmilk". Prolongations are also common in children beginning to stutter.
*'''Blocks''' are inappropriate cessation of sound and air, often associated with freezing of the movement of the tongue, lips and/or vocal folds. Blocks often develop later, and can be associated with muscle tension and effort.<ref name="Guitar14–15">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp=14–15}}</ref>

===Variability===
The severity of a stutter is often not constant even for people who severely stutter. People who stutter commonly report dramatically increased fluency when talking in unison with another speaker, copying another's speech, whispering, singing, and acting or when talking to pets, young children, or themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=13–14}}</ref> Other situations, such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone are often greatly feared by people who stutter, and increased stuttering is reported.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 14}}</ref>

===Feelings and attitudes===
Stuttering may have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters. Joseph Sheehan, a prominent researcher in the field, has described stuttering in terms of the [[Cliché|well-known]] [[analogy]] to an [[iceberg]], with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the [[waterline]] and a broader set of symptoms such as negative [[emotion]]s hidden below the surface.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalinowski|2006| p=17}}</ref> Feelings of [[embarrassment]], [[shame]], [[frustration]], [[fear]], [[anger]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] are frequent in people who stutter,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=179}}</ref> and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering.<ref name="Guitar16–7">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp=16–7}}</ref> With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. A person who stutters may project his or her attitudes onto others, believing that they think he or she is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.<ref name="Guitar16–7"/>

Many people who stutter report about a high [[emotion]]al cost, including jobs or [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] not received, as well as [[romance (love)|relationships]] broken or not pursued.<ref>Pollack, Andrew. "[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/health/12stutt.html To Fight Stuttering, Doctors Look at the Brain]", ''New York Times'', September 12, 2006.</ref>

===Fluency and disfluency===
Linguistic tasks can invoke [[speech disfluency]].  People who stutter may "move along a continuum from fluency to [[Speech disfluency|dysfluency]]."<ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." />  Tasks that trigger disfluency usually require a controlled-language processing, which involves linguistic planning. In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals have fluency when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing "Happy Birthday" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses could be fluid in people who stutter.  Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, "controlled" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.<ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.">{{cite web|last=Sandak|first=R|title=Stuttering: a view from neuroimaging|publisher=Lancet. 2000.}}</ref>

==Sub-types==

===Developmental===
Stuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children.<ref name="gordon">{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental medicine and child neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278–81 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 | doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name="craig2005">{{cite journal |author= Craig, A.|coauthors= Tran, Y.|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech–Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41–46 |year=2005 |ref= harv |doi= 10.1080/14417040500055060}}</ref> The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.<ref name="fn 30"/> Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, and secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.<ref name="Ward13">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=13}}</ref> Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.<ref name="Ward13"/> With early people who stutter, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relative fluency.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=114–5}}</ref>

Though the rate of early recovery is very high,<ref name="gordon"/> with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.<ref name="Ward13"/> Some propose that parental reaction may affect the development of chronic stutter. Recommendations to slow down, take a breath, say it again, etc. may increase the child’s anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the "cycle of stuttering" to ever yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 13, 115}}</ref> With time secondary stuttering including escape behaviours such as eye blinking, lip movements, etc. may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as "stutterers". With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 115–116}}</ref> Other, rarer, patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.<ref name="Ward 2006 pp= 117–119">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 117–119}}</ref> The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not develop secondary stuttering behaviours.<ref name="Ward 2006 pp= 117–119"/>
Another way stuttering comes about is through child development. Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal dysfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal dysfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words; however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable when a child is excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiocology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Acquired stuttering===
In rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote fluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name="gordon"/><ref name="craig2005"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332–335}}</ref>

Psychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332, 335–337}}</ref>

==Causes of developmental stuttering==
No single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple factors contributing to stuttering.<ref name="gordon"/> Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis.<ref name="Guitar5–6">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp= 5–6}}</ref> Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 11}}</ref> However, [[Twin study|twin]] and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur,<ref name="Guitar66">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 66}}</ref> and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.<ref>{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 39}}</ref>
There is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have [[wikt:concomitant|concomitant]] speech, language, learning or motor difficulties.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 12}}</ref> Robert West, a pioneer of genetic studies in stuttering, has suggested that the presence of stuttering is connected to the fact that articulated speech is the last major acquisition in human evolution.<ref name="west">{{cite journal |author=West, R.|coauthors= Nelson. S, Berry, M. |year = 1939 |title =  The heredity of stuttering |journal= Quarterly Journal of Speech |issue=25 |pages=23–30 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/00335633909380434 |volume=25}}</ref> Another view is that a stutter is a complex [[tic]].<ref>[http://www.theoryofstuttering-stammering.co.uk/Sims.pdf Sixth Oxford Dysfluency Conference]</ref>

In a 2010 article, three genes were found to correlate with stuttering: [[GNPTAB]], [[GNPTG]], and [[NAGPA]]. Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9% of people who stutter who have a family history of stuttering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://children.webmd.com/news/20100210/genetic-mutations-linked-to-stuttering |title=Genetic Mutations Linked to Stuttering |publisher=Children.webmd.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>

For some people who stutter, congenital factors may play a role. These may include physical trauma at or around birth, as well as [[cerebral palsy]] and [[mental retardation]]. For other people who stutter, there could be added impact due to stressful situations such as the birth of a sibling, moving, or a sudden growth in linguistic ability.<ref name="Guitar5–6"/><ref name="Guitar66"/>

There is clear empirical evidence for structural and functional differences in the brains of people who stutter. Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirm structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.<ref name="watkins">{{cite journal |author= Kate, Watkins|title= Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |year=2007 |pmid=17928317 | volume = 131 | pages = 50–9 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm241 |last2= Smith |first2= SM |last3= Davis |first3= S |last4= Howell |first4= P |issue= Pt 1 |pmc= 2492392 |ref= harv}}</ref><ref name="chang">{{cite journal |author= Soo-Eun, Chang|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=[[NeuroImage (journal)|NeuroImage]] |year=2007 |ref= harv }}</ref>

Auditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 46–7}}</ref> and stuttering may be improved when auditory feedback is altered, such as [[Auditory masking|masking]], [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.<ref name="gordon"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 58}}</ref> There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.<ref name="gordon"/>

There is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 43}}</ref> Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.<ref name="gordon"/><ref name="Guitar66"/>

The ''capacities and demands'' model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the ''capacity'' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the ''demands'' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech, which may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] or inadequate language skills or external factors such as [[peer pressure]], time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 16–21}}</ref>


==Neuroimaging of developmental stuttering in adults==
Several neuroimaging studies have emerged in order to identify areas associated with stuttering. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults.  In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.

Studies utilizing [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show [[hypoactivity]] in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as [[Broca's area]], but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function.<ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." />  One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.<ref name="Bloodstein 1" />

In non-stuttering, normal speech, PET scans show that both hemispheres are active but that the left hemisphere may be more active. By contrast, people who stutter yield more activity on the right hemisphere, suggesting that it might be interfering with left-hemisphere speech production.   Another comparison of scans [[anterior forebrain]] regions are disproportionately active in stuttering subjects, while post-rolandic regions are relatively inactive.<ref name=Braun>{{cite web|last=Braun|title=Altered patterns of cerebral activity during speech and language production in developmental stuttering. An H2(15)O positron emission tomography study.}}</ref>

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.<ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." />

Researchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).  In single-word-recognition tasks, people who do not stutter showed cortical activation first in [[:wikt:occipital|occipital]] areas, then in left inferior-frontal regions such as Broca’s area, and finally, in motor and premotor cortices.  The people who stutter also first had cortical activation in the occipital areas, but, interestingly, the left inferior-frontal regions were activated only after the motor and premotor cortices were activated.<ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." /><ref name="Bloodstein 1" />

It is important to note that the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not conclude if childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or if the abnormalities cause stuttering.<ref name=watkins /> Future research should address a longitudinal case study to track the development of brain structure in relation to stuttering.

==Physiopathology of developmental stuttering==
Much evidence from neuroimaging techniques has supported the theory that the right-hemisphere of people who stutter interferes with left-hemisphere speech production. Additionally, people who stutter seem to activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated.

===Overactivity and underactivity===
During speech production, people who stutter show overactivity in the anterior insula, cerebellum and bilateral midbrain.  They show underactivity in the ventral premotor, Rolandic opercular and sensorimotor cortex bilaterally and Heschl’s gyrus in the left hemisphere.<ref name=Watkins>{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Katie|title=Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering.|url=http://ejournals.ebsco.com/direct.asp?ArticleID=45D698747EE92E94DB3A}}</ref>  Additionally, speech production in people who stutter yields underactivity in cortical motor and premotor areas.<ref name=watkins />

===Anatomical differences===
Though neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific cortical correlates, there is much evidence that there are differences in the brain physiology of adults who stutter in comparison to those who do not.

Asymmetry has been found between the left and right [[planum temporale]] in comparing people who stutter and people who do not stutter.<ref name="Bloodstein 1">{{cite web|last=Bloodstein|first=Oliver|title=Handbook on Stuttering|work=p.142|publisher=2007}}</ref> These studies have also found that there are anatomical differences in the [[Rolandic operculum]] and [[arcuate fasciculus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Dopamine abnormalities===
Recent studies have found that adults who stutter have elevated levels of the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], and have thus found [[dopamine antagonist]]s that reduce stuttering (see anti-stuttering medication below).<ref name="Bloodstein 1"/> Overactivity of the midbrain has been found at the level of the substantia nigra extended to the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus, which all contribute to the production of dopamine.<ref name=watkins />

==Treatment==
{{main|Stuttering therapy}}

===Fluency shaping therapy===
Fluency shaping therapy, also known as "speak more fluently", "prolonged speech", or "connected speech", trains people who stutter to speak fluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 257}}</ref>

People who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other fluency techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these fluency skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 257–67}}</ref>

===Stuttering modification therapy===
The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 253}}</ref> The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was published by [[Charles Van Riper]] in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 245}}</ref>  However, depending on the patient, speech therapy may be ineffective.<ref>[http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ Stuttering, Stammering]</ref>

===Electronic fluency device===
{{main|Electronic fluency device}}
Altered auditory feedback, so that people who stutter hear their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering.<ref name="bothe2007">{{cite journal |author=Bothe, A.&nbsp;K. |coauthors= Finn,&nbsp;P.; Bramlett, R.&nbsp;E. |title=Pseudoscience and the SpeechEasy: Reply to Kalinowski, Saltuklaroglu, Stuart, and Guntupalli (2007)|journal= American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology |volume=16 |pages=77–83 |year=2007 |pmid=17329678 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2007/010) |ref=harv}}</ref> Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the person who stutter's voice while talking (masking), by delaying the person who stutter's voice slightly (delayed auditory feedback) and/or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback).

===Anti-stuttering medications===
The effectiveness of pharmacological agents, such as [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[antipsychotic]] and [[antihypertensive]] medications, and [[dopamine antagonist]]s in the treatment of stuttering has been evaluated in studies involving both adults and children.<ref name="Bothe2006">{{cite journal |author=Bothe, A.&nbsp;K.|coauthors= Davidow, J.&nbsp;H.; Bramlett, R.&nbsp;E.; Franic, D.&nbsp;M.; Ingham, R.&nbsp;J. |title=Stuttering Treatment Research 1970-2005: II.

In addition, potentially serious [[side effect]]s of pharmacological treatments were noted,<ref name="Bothe2006"/> such as [[weight gain]] and the potential for [[blood pressure]] increases.

===Support groups and the self-help movement===
With existing behavioral, prosthetic, and pharmaceutical treatments providing limited relief from the overt symptoms of stuttering, support groups and the self-help movement continues to gain popularity and support by professionals and people who stutter. One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods. Psychoanalysis has claimed success in the treatment of stuttering.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j24t0849x4p45338/ |title=Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy, Volume 2, Number 2 |publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>

===Diaphragmatic breathing===
Several treatment initiatives advocate [[diaphragmatic breathing]] (or ''costal breathing'') as a means by which stuttering can be controlled. Performing vocal artists{{clarify|date=July 2012}}<!-- In general, or just those who stuttered before diaphragm strengthening? -->, who have strengthened their diaphragm, tend to stutter when speaking but not when singing because singing involves voluntary diaphragm usage while speaking involves involuntary diaphragm usage primarily.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/adther_costal.html] British Stammering Association page on costal breathing.</ref><ref>[http://stutteringtreatment.org/blog/2009/07/two-great-videos-on-how-diaphragmatic-breathing-works/] American Institute for Stuttering</ref>

==Prognosis==
Among preschoolers, the [[prognosis]] for recovery is good. Based on research, about 65% of preschoolers who stutter recover spontaneously in the first two years of stuttering,<ref name="fn 30">{{cite journal |author=Yairi,&nbsp;E.|coauthors= Ambrose,&nbsp;N.|title=Onset of stuttering in preschool children: selected factors |journal=Journal of speech and hearing research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=782–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1405533 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name="fn 31">{{cite journal|author=Yairi,&nbsp;E.|year=1993|title=Epidemiologic and other considerations in treatment efficacy research with preschool-age children who stutter|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=18|pages=197–220|doi=10.1016/0094-730X(93)90007-Q|ref=harv|issue=2–3}}</ref> and about 74% recover by their early teens.<ref name="Ward16">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 16}}</ref> In particular, girls seem to recover well.<ref name="Ward16"/><ref name="fn 34">{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E|title=On the Gender Factor in Stuttering|journal=Stuttering Foundation of America newsletter|date=Fall 2005|page= 5|ref= harv}}</ref>  For others, early intervention is effective in helping the child achieve normal fluency.<ref name="Guitar7">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p=7}}</ref>

Once stuttering has become established, and the child has developed secondary behaviors, the prognosis is more guarded,<ref name="Guitar7"/> and only 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously.<ref name="fn 32">{{cite journal |author=Andrews, G|coauthors= Craig,&nbsp;A.; Feyer, A.&nbsp;M.; Hoddinott,&nbsp;S.; Howie,&nbsp;P.; Neilson,&nbsp;M. |title=Stuttering: a review of research findings and theories circa 1982 |journal=The Journal of speech and hearing disorders |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=226–46 |year=1983 |pmid=6353066 |ref=harv}}</ref> However, with treatment young children may be left with little evidence of stuttering.<ref name="Guitar7"/>

With adult people who stutter, there is no known cure,<ref name="Ward16"/> though they may make partial recovery or even complete recovery with intervention. People who stutter often learn to stutter less severely and be less affected emotionally, though others may make no progress with therapy.<ref name="Guitar7"/>

==Epidemiology==
The lifetime [[prevalence]], or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%,<ref name="Mansson2000">{{cite journal|author= Mansson,&nbsp;H.|year=2000|title=Childhood stuttering: Incidence and development|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47–57|doi=10.1016/S0094-730X(99)00023-6|ref= harv}}</ref> and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females.<ref name="craig2005"/><ref name="Yairi96">{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E|coauthors= Ambrose, N; Cox, N|year=1996|title=Genetics of stuttering: a critical review|journal=Journal of Speech Language Hearing Research|volume= 39|pages=771–784|ref= harv}}</ref><ref name="fn 28">{{cite journal |author=Kloth, S|coauthors= Janssen, P; Kraaimaat, F; Brutten, G |year = 1995 |title = Speech-motor and linguistic skills of young people who stutter prior to onset |journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders |issue=20 |pages=157–70 | doi=10.1016/0094-730X(94)00022-L | volume = 20 |ref=harv}}</ref> Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of children under the age of 5 stutter.<ref name="Proctor"/><ref name="Yairi2005"/> The sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter about two to one, or less.<ref name="fn 28"/><ref name="Yairi2005"/> but widens to three to one at first grade and five to one at fifth grade,<ref>{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 22}}</ref> due to higher recovery rates in girls.<ref name="Ward16"/> Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery,<ref name="Yairi96"/><ref name="Yairi99">{{cite journal |author=Yairi,&nbsp;E.|coauthors= Ambrose, N.&nbsp;G. |title=Early childhood stuttering&nbsp;I: persistency and recovery rates |journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1097–112 |year=1999 |pmid=10515508 |ref=harv}}</ref> the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.<ref name="craig2005"/><ref name="Craig">{{cite journal |author=Craig,&nbsp;A.|coauthors= Hancock,&nbsp;K.; Tran,&nbsp;Y.; Craig,&nbsp;M.; Peters,&nbsp;K. |title=Epidemiology of stuttering in the community across the entire life span |journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1097–105 |year=2002 |pmid=12546480 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2002/088) |ref=harv}}</ref>

Cross-cultural studies of the stuttering prevalence were very active in early and middle of the 20th century, particularly under the influence of the works of [[Wendell Johnson]], who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents. Johnson claimed there were cultures where stuttering, and even the word "stutterer", were absent (for example, among some tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]). Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races<ref name="Guitar5–6"/> at similar rates,<ref name="craig2005"/> about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world. A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of stuttering in preschool children.<ref name="Proctor">{{cite journal|author= Proctor,&nbsp;A.|coauthors= Duff,&nbsp;M.; Yairi,&nbsp;E.|year=2002|title=Early childhood stuttering: African Americans and European Americans|journal=ASHA Leader|volume=4|issue=15|page=102|ref= harv}}</ref><ref name="Yairi2005">{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E.|coauthors= Ambrose,&nbsp;N.|year=2005|title=Early childhood stuttering|location=[[Austin, Texas]]|journal=Pro-Ed|ref= harv}}</ref> At the same time, there are cross-cultural studies indicating that the difference between cultures may exist. For example, summarizing prevalence studies, E. Cooper and C. Cooper conclude: "On the basis of the data currently available, it appears the prevalence of fluency disorders varies among the cultures of the world, with some indications that the prevalence of fluency disorders labeled as stuttering is higher among black populations than white or Asian populations" (Cooper & Cooper, 1993:197).

Different regions of the world are researched very unevenly. The largest number of studies had been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population (Bloodtein, 1995. A Handbook on Stuttering). African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Nwokah, E|year=1988|title=The imbalance of stuttering behavior in bilingual speakers|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=13|pages=357–373|doi = 10.1016/0094-730X(88)90004-6|ref = harv|issue = 5}}</ref> Many regions of the world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all (for example, in China). Some claim the reason for this might be a lower incidence in general population in China.<ref name="reese">{{cite journal |author= Sheree Reese, [[Joseph Jordania]]|title= Stuttering in the Chinese population in some Southeast Asian countries: A preliminary investigation on attitude and incidence |journal="Stuttering Awareness Day"; Minnesota State University, Mankato, |year=2001 |url= http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/isad4/papers/reese2.html |ref= harv}}</ref>

[[Image:LewisCarrollSelfPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lewis Carroll]], the well-known author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', was afflicted with a stammer, as were his siblings.]]

==History==
Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced and the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, it has long been a subject of scientific interest and speculation as well as discrimination and ridicule. People who stutter can be traced back centuries to the likes of [[Demosthenes]], who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth.<ref name="brosch">{{cite journal |author=Brosch, S|coauthors= Pirsig,&nbsp;W.|title=Stuttering in history and culture |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=81–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11378182 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-5876(01)00474-8 |ref=harv}}</ref> The [[Talmud]] interprets [[Bible]] passages to indicate [[Moses]] was also a person who stuttered, and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be "slow and hesitant of speech" (Exodus 4, v.10)<ref name="brosch"/>

[[Galen]]'s humoral theories were influential in Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering was attributed to imbalances of the [[four bodily humors]]—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. [[Hieronymus Mercurialis]], writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced lovemaking (in men only), and [[vomiting|purging]]. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century.<ref name="rieber">{{cite journal |author=Rieber, RW|coauthors= Wollock, J |title=The historical roots of the theory and therapy of stuttering |journal=Journal of communication disorders |volume=10 |issue=1–2 |pages=3–24 |year=1977 |pmid=325028 | doi = 10.1016/0021-9924(77)90009-0 |ref=harv}}</ref> Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius]] was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.<ref name="brosch"/>

In and around eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe, surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended, including cutting the tongue with scissors, removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue, and cutting nerves, or neck and lip muscles. Others recommended shortening the [[uvula]] or removing the [[tonsil]]s. All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support "weak" muscles.<ref name="brosch"/>

[[Image:Notker Balbulus 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Notker of St. Gall|Notker Balbulus]], from a medieval manuscript.]]
Italian [[pathologist]] [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] attributed stuttering to deviations in the [[hyoid bone]], a conclusion he came to via [[autopsy]].<ref name="rieber"/> Blessed [[Notker of St. Gall]] (ca. 840–912), called Balbulus ("The Stutterer") and described by his biographer as being "delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine," was invoked against stammering.

Famous Englishmen who stammered were King [[George VI]] and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who led the UK through World War II.

George VI went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist [[Lionel Logue]], for his stammer. This is dealt with in the Academy Award-winning film ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010) in which [[Colin Firth]] plays George VI. The film is based on an original screenplay by [[David Seidler]] who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.<ref name=DM>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1339509/The-Kings-Speech-How-naughty-word-cured-King-George-VIs-stutter.html|title=How  the 'naughty word' cured the King's stutter (and mine)|author=David Seidler |date=20 December 2010|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''}}</ref>

Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that "[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience..."<ref name="fn 10">{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | publisher=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | accessdate=2005-04-05}}</ref> However, those who knew Churchill and [http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/sharp/Churchill.htm commented] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary [[Phyllis Moir]] commented that "Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter" in her 1941 book ''I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary''. She also noted that about one incident 'It’s s s simply s s splendid" he stuttered, as he always did when excited.’ Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States wrote in Volume 55 of ''The American Mercury'' (1942) that "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple" and that "born with a stutter and a [[lisp]], both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man’s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time."

For centuries "cures" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one's life, "hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy", strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] were used.<ref name="fn 6">{{cite web | author = Kuster, Judith Maginnis | title=Folk Myths About Stuttering | publisher=[[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] | date = 2005-04-01 | url= http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/Infostuttering/folkmyths.html | accessdate=2005-04-03}}</ref> Similarly, in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd. Proposed causes of stuttering have included [[tickling]] an infant too much, eating improperly during [[breastfeeding]], allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the "work of the devil."<ref name="fn 6"/>

==Popular culture==
{{main|Stuttering in popular culture}}
[[Jazz]] and [[Eurodance]] musician [[Scatman John]] wrote the song "[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]" to help children who stutter overcome adversity. Born John Paul Larkin, Scatman spoke with a stutter himself and won the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community.<ref>[http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/famous/kudos.html Awards and Recognition]. Retrieved 2009-12-10.</ref>

Fiction character [[Arkwright (Open All Hours)|Albert Arkwright]] from [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Open All Hours]]'', stammered and much of the series' humour revolved around this.  Recurring character [[Reginald Barclay]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television franchise and the [[Emperor Claudius]] from the ''[[I,&nbsp;Claudius]]'' series by [[Robert Graves]] and acted by [[Derek Jacobi]] are portrayed as suffering from and overcoming their stuttering. 

[[Cartoon]] character [[Porky Pig]] has a notable stutter.  This arose because his original voice artist, [[Joe Dougherty]], had an authentic stammer. However, Dougherty's stutter caused recording sessions to take longer than otherwise necessary, and so [[Warner Bros.]] replaced him with [[Mel Blanc]], who provided Porky's voice for the rest of his life. Porky's stutter is probably most pronounced when he says "Th-th-th-that's all, folks!" Also a person who stutters is the cartoon character Keswick from [[T.U.F.F. Puppy]].
