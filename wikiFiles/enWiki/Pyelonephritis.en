'''Pyelonephritis''' (from  [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πήληξ – pyelum'', meaning "[[renal pelvis]]", ''[[wikt:νεφρός|νεφρός]] – nephros'', meaning "[[kidney]]", and ''[[wikt:itis|-itis]]'', meaning "[[inflammation]]") is an ascending [[urinary tract infection]] that has reached the ''pyelum'' or pelvis of the kidney. It is a form of [[nephritis]] that is also referred to as '''pyelitis'''. Severe cases of pyelonephritis can lead to [[pyonephrosis]] (pus accumulation around the kidney), '''[[sepsis|urosepsis]]''' (a [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|systemic inflammatory response]] of the body to infection), [[acute kidney injury|kidney failure]] and even death.

Pyelonephritis presents with [[fever]], [[tachycardia|accelerated heart rate]], [[dysuria|painful urination]], [[renal colic|abdominal pain radiating to the back]], [[nausea]], and [[Murphy's punch sign|tenderness at the costovertebral angle]] on the affected side. Pyelonephritis that has progressed to urosepsis may be accompanied by [[Medical sign|signs]] of [[septic shock]], including [[tachypnea|rapid breathing]], [[hypotension|decreased blood pressure]], [[Chills|violent shivering]], and occasionally [[delirium]]. Pyelonephritis requires [[Antibacterial|antibiotic]] therapy, and sometimes surgical intervention such as [[ureteroscopy]], [[percutaneous]] [[nephrostomy]] or [[percutaneous nephrolithotomy]], as well as treatment of any underlying causes to prevent its recurrence. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare form of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] pyelonephritis in which [[nephrectomy]] (removal of the kidney) is usually necessary for definitive treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}

Symptoms of acute pyelonephritis generally develop rapidly over a few hours or a day. It can cause high fever, pain on passing urine, and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back. There is often associated [[vomiting]].<ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/>

Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain, signs of infection (fever, [[Weight_loss#Unintentional_weight_loss|unintentional weight loss]], [[malaise]], ;;[[Anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]]), [[lower urinary tract symptoms]] and [[hematuria|blood in the urine]].<ref name=Korkes2008/> Chronic pyelonephritis can in addition cause [[fever of unknown origin]]. Furthermore, inflammation-related proteins can accumulate in organs and cause the condition [[AA amyloidosis]].<ref name=Herrera2007/>

Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side.<ref name=Weiss2007/>

==Causes==
Most cases of "community-acquired" pyelonephritis are due to bowel organisms that enter the urinary tract. Common organisms are ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' (70&ndash;80%) and ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]''. [[Nosocomial infection|Hospital-acquired infections]] may be due to [[coliform bacteria]] and enterococci, as well as other organisms uncommon in the community (e.g. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and various species of ''[[Klebsiella]]''). Most cases of pyelonephritis start off as lower urinary tract infections, mainly [[cystitis]] and [[prostatitis]].<ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/> ''E. coli'' can invade the superficial umbrella cells of the bladder to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs), which can mature into [[biofilm]]s. These biofilm-producing ''E. coli'' are resistant to antibiotic therapy and immune system responses, and present a possible explanation for recurrent urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis.<ref name=Hultgren2011/> Risk is increased in the following situations:<ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/><ref name=Scholes2005/>
* Mechanical: any structural abnormalities in the urinary tract, [[vesicoureteral reflux]] (urine from the bladder flowing back into the [[ureter]]), [[kidney stone]]s, [[Urinary catheterization|urinary tract catheterization]], [[Ureteric stent|ureteral stents]] or drainage procedures (e.g. [[nephrostomy]]), [[pregnancy]], [[neurogenic bladder]] (e.g. due to spinal cord damage, [[spina bifida]] or [[multiple sclerosis]]) and [[prostate]] disease (e.g. [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]) in men
* Constitutional: [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] states
* Behavioral: change in sexual partner within the last year, [[spermicide]] use
* Positive [[family history]] (close family members with frequent urinary tract infections)

==Diagnosis==
===Laboratory examination===
[[Urinalysis]] may show signs of urinary tract infection. Specifically, the presence of [[Nitrite test|nitrite]] and [[white blood cell]]s on a [[urine test strip]] in patients with typical symptoms are sufficient for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, and are an indication for [[empirical treatment]]. [[Blood test]]s such as a [[complete blood count]] may show [[neutrophilia]]. [[Microbiological culture]] of the urine, with or without [[blood culture]]s and [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|antibiotic sensitivity testing]] are useful for establishing a formal diagnosis,<ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/> and are considered mandatory.<ref name=Gupta2011/>

===Imaging studies===
If a kidney stone is suspected (e.g. on the basis of characteristic [[Renal colic|colicky pain]] or the presence of a disproportionate amount of blood in the urine), a [[kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray]] (KUB film) may assist in identifying [[radiodensity|radioopaque]] stones.<ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/> Where available, a noncontrast [[Helical cone beam computed tomography|helical CT scan]] with 5&nbsp;millimeter sections is the diagnostic modality of choice in the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis.<ref name=Pearle2007/><ref name=SmithCentennial2000/><ref name=Fang2009/> All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine.<ref name=Pietrow2006/> In patients with recurrent ascending urinary tract infections, it may be necessary to exclude an anatomical abnormality, such as vesicoureteral reflux or [[polycystic kidney disease]]. Investigations used in this setting include [[Abdominal ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] of the kidneys or [[voiding cystourethrogram|voiding cystourethrography]].<ref name=Ramakrishnan2005/> CT scan or abdominal ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis; serial imaging may be useful for differentiating this condition from kidney cancer.<ref name=Korkes2008/>

==Classification==
===Acute pyelonephritis===
Acute pyelonephritis is an [[exudate|exudative]] [[Pus|purulent]] localized [[inflammation]] of the [[renal pelvis]] (collecting system) and kidney. The [[Nephron|renal parenchyma]] presents in the interstitium abscesses (suppurative [[necrosis]]), consisting in purulent exudate (pus): neutrophils, fibrin, cell debris and central germ colonies (hematoxylinophils). Tubules are damaged by exudate and may contain neutrophil casts. In the early stages, the [[glomerulus]] and vessels are normal. Gross pathology often reveals pathognomonic radiations of [[bleeding]] and [[Pus|suppuration]] through the renal pelvis to the [[renal cortex]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Chronic pyelonephritis===
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}
Chronic pyelonephritis implies recurrent kidney infections, and can result in [[fibrosis|scarring]] of the renal parenchyma and impaired function, especially in the setting of obstruction. A perinephric [[abscess]] (infection around the kidney) and/or pyonephrosis may develop in severe cases of pyelonephritis.<ref name=Griebling2007/>

===Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis===
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an unusual form of chronic pyelonephritis characterized by [[granuloma]]tous [[abscess]] formation, severe kidney destruction, and a clinical picture that may resemble [[renal cell carcinoma]] and other inflammatory [[nephron|renal parenchymal]] diseases. Most patients present with recurrent fevers and urosepsis, [[anemia]], and a painful renal mass. Other common manifestations include kidney stones and loss of function of the affected kidney. Bacterial cultures of renal tissue are almost always positive.<ref name=Malek1978/> [[Histopathology|Microscopically]], there are granulomas and [[lipid]]-laden [[macrophage]]s (hence the term ''xantho''-, which means yellow in [[ancient Greek]]). It is found in roughly 20% of specimens from surgically managed cases of pyelonephritis.<ref name=Korkes2008/>

==Management==
In patients suspected of having pyelonephritis, a urine culture and [[antibiotic sensitivity]] test is performed, and initial therapy is tailored on the basis of the infecting organism. As most cases of pyelonephritis are due to bacterial infections, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. The choice of antibiotic depends on the species and antibiotic sensitivity profile of the infecting organism, and may include [[Quinolone|fluoroquinolones]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[aminoglycoside]]s, or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]], either alone or in combination.<ref name=Gupta2011/>

In patients not requiring hospitalization where there is a low prevalence of [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant]] bacteria, an oral fluoroquinolone such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[levofloxacin]] is an appropriate initial choice for therapy. In areas where there is a higher prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single intravenous dose of a long-acting antibiotic such as [[ceftriaxone]] or an aminoglycoside, and then continuing treatment with an oral fluoroquinolone. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an appropriate choice for therapy if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. If trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is used when the susceptibility is not known, it is useful to initiate treatment with a single intravenous dose of a long-acting antibiotic such as ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside. Oral [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s are less effective than other available agents for treatment of pyelonephritis.<ref name=Gupta2011/>

People with acute pyelonephritis that is accompanied by high fever and [[leukocytosis]] are typically admitted to the hospital for intravenous hydration and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Treatment is typically initiated with an intravenous fluoroquinolone, an aminoglycoside, an [[extended-spectrum penicillin]] or cephalosporin, or a [[carbapenem]]. Combination antibiotic therapy is often used in such situations. The treatment regimen is selected based on local resistance data and the susceptibility profile of the specific infecting organism(s).<ref name=Gupta2011/>

During the course of antibiotic treatment, serial white blood cell count and temperature are closely monitored. Typically, the intravenous antibiotics are continued until the patient is afebrile for at least 24 to 48&nbsp;hours, then equivalent oral antibiotic agents can be given for a total of 2&ndash;week duration of treatment.<ref name=Starlin2005/> Intravenous fluids may be administered to compensate for the reduced oral intake, insensible losses (due to the raised temperature) and [[vasodilation]] and to optimize urine output. [[Percutaneous nephrostomy]] or ureteral stent placement may be indicated to relieve obstruction caused by a stone. Children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics ([[cefixime]], [[ceftibuten]] and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4&nbsp;days) of intravenous therapy followed by oral therapy. If intravenous therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Treatment of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis involves antibiotics as well as surgery. Nephrectomy is the best surgical treatment in the overwhelming majority of cases, although polar resection (partial nephrectomy) has been effective for some people with localized disease.<ref name=Korkes2008/><ref name=Rosi1986/> [[Watchful waiting]] with serial imaging may be appropriate in rare circumstances.<ref name=Lebret2007/>

==Prevention==
In people who experience recurrent urinary tract infections, additional investigations may identify an underlying abnormality. Occasionally, surgical intervention is necessary to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. If no abnormality is identified, some studies suggest long-term [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] (prophylactic) treatment with antibiotics, either daily or after [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].<ref name=Schooff2005/> In children at risk for recurrent urinary tract infections, [[meta-analysis]] of the existing literature indicates that not enough studies have been performed to conclude prescription of long-term antibiotics have a net positive benefit.<ref name=Williams2011/> Ingestion of [[cranberry juice]] has been studied as a prophylactic measure; many studies suggest a benefit.<ref name=Mahan2007/><ref name=Raz2004/><ref name=Wang2012/> Increasing fluid intake, consuming cranberry juice, [[blueberry]] juice, and fermented milk products containing [[probiotic]] bacteria have all been shown to inhibit adherence of bacteria to the [[Urothelium|epithelial cells]] of the urinary tract, and may reduce the recurrence rate of urinary tract infections.<ref name=Mahan2007/>

==Epidemiology==
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of pyelonephritis is roughly 12&ndash;13 cases annually per 10,000 population in women receiving outpatient treatment and 3&ndash;4 requiring admission. In men, 2&ndash;3 per 10,000 are treated as outpatients and 1&ndash;2/10,000 require admission.<ref name=Czaja2007/> Young women are most often affected, probably reflecting sexual activity in that age group. Infants and the elderly are also at increased risk, reflecting anatomical changes and hormonal status.<ref name=Czaja2007/> Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is most common in middle-aged women.<ref name=Malek1978/> It can present somewhat differently in children, in whom it may be mistaken for [[Wilms' tumor]].<ref name=Goodman1998/>
