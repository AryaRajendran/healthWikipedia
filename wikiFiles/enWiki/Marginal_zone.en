The '''marginal zone''' is the region at the interface between the non-lymphoid [[red pulp]] and the [[lymphoid]] [[white-pulp]] of the [[spleen]]. (Some sources consider it to be the part of red pulp which borders on the white pulp, while other sources consider it to be neither red pulp nor white pulp.)

A marginal zone also exists in [[lymph node]]s.<ref>http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/lymphnodes.html</ref>

==Composition and markers==
It is composed of cells derived primarily from the [[myeloid]] compartment of [[bone marrow]] differentiation. At least three distinct [[cellular markers]] can be used to identify cells of the marginal zone, [[MOMA-1]], [[ERTR-9]] and [[MARCO]].

==Function==
The major role of marginal zone is to trap particulate [[antigen]] from the [[Circulatory system|circulation]] and present the antigen to the lymphocytes of the spleen. 

Experiments have shown that inert [[latex]] [[beads]] as well as live bacteria such as [[Escherichia coli]] and [[Listeria monocytogenes]] are trapped by the marginal zone. However, only immunogenic substances, i.e. [[bacteria]], are trafficked to the T and B cell zones of the white-pulp and are efficiently presented to elicit an immune response.

==Lymphocytes==
Marginal zone [[lymphocytes]] are a type of [[B cell]] ([[Marginal-zone B cell]], abbreviated "MZ B cell") created there, capable of binding [[IgM]]-antigen complexes. They are notable for their ability to serve several different roles in the [[immune system]].
