'''Drug fraud''' is a type of fraud in which drugs, legal or illegal, are [[Cutting agent|cut]] or altered in such a way that diminishes their value below that which they are sold for.

== Illegal drug fraud ==

{{main|Lacing (drugs)}}

This type of drug fraud occurs then the dealer cuts or commingles the pure drug with a similar substance such as [[baby powder]] or [[powdered milk]].  When this is sold to the [[drug user|user]], the user receives less of a [[Substance intoxication|high]] and so must buy more to get the previous high.  There may also be adverse health consequences as a result of the cutting substance, such as a [[bad trip]] or [[Drug overdose|overdose]]. This can also be seen in [[prescription drug]]s.<ref>Hileman, Bette.

== Legal drug fraud ==

Legal drug fraud occurs when a physician prescribes medication for a patient under false pretenses. This may be because the manufacturers of the drug have [[Bribery#Medicine|paid the doctor a fee]] to dispense their drug.  Another cause may be [[drug pricing fraud]], in which a physician prescribes a patient expensive drugs, that they may or may not need, in order to profit from the receipts.<ref>Beyerle, Dana.

Patients too, may participate in this.  A common method is the forging of doctor prescriptions to gain access to [[prescription drug|prescription medication]]s. A somewhat rarer type is a citizen posing as a doctor to, among other things, gain access to the [[free sample]]s of drugs that some drug manufacturers give out. The samples may also be sold to desperate patients at an exorbitant rate. Actual physicians may do this also.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/02/us-drugsamples-idUSN3158060620080102|title=Free drug samples go to wealthy, insured: U.S. study|last=Dixon|first=Kim|date=Jan 2, 2008|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=6 November 2010|location=Washington}}</ref><ref>Nordenberg, Tamar "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n2_v32/ai_20383017 Selling drug samples lands doctor in prison - Dr. Kumaralingam Nagalingam sentenced for Medicare fraud and selling free drug samples]" FDA Consumer.

== Legal status ==

Illegal drug fraud is rarely addressed in court, as victims rarely involve police, but legal drug fraud is on the rise.  Its upswing has increased calls for [[accountability]] as well as a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] being passed in the United States, 2007 Senate Bill 88.<ref>[http://www.kentuckyvotes.org/2007-SB-88 2007 Senate Bill 88 (Tighten rules against drug fraud) - KentuckyVotes.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
