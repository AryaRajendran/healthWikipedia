'''Urethral syndrome''' is defined as symptoms suggestive of a lower urinary tract infection but in the absence of significant [[bacteriuria]] with a conventional [[pathogen]].<ref name="pmid7928838">{{cite journal |author=Hamilton-Miller JM |title=The urethral syndrome and its management |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=Suppl A |issue= |pages=63–73 |series=33 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=7928838 |doi= |url=}}</ref> There are other non-infective causes that should be considered such as trauma, [[Allergy|allergies]], anatomical features such as [[diverticula]], and post-surgical scarring.

==Presentation==
Most women will give a history of chronic recurrent [[urinary tract infections]] (UTI) but the cultures seem to not show any conventional bacterial growth,<ref name="pmid1859947">{{cite journal |author=Brumfitt W, Hamilton-Miller JM, Gillespie WA |title=The mysterious "urethral syndrome" |journal=BMJ |volume=303 |issue=6793 |pages=1–2 |year=1991 |month=July |pmid=1859947 |pmc=1670265 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.303.6793.1|url=}}</ref> and [[pyuria]] (more than 5 [[white blood cells]] per [[High Power Field]]) is absent. There may also be a history of these episodes often being related to [[sexual intercourse]]. 

Some physicians believe that urethral syndrome may be due to a low grade infection of the [[Skene's gland]]s on the sides and bottom of the [[urethra]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The Skene's glands are embryologically related to the [[prostate]] gland in the male, thus urethral syndrome may share a comparable etiology with chronic [[prostatitis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Treatment==
Treatment of acute urethral syndrome is antibiotics.{{vague|date=November 2012}}{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For chronic urethral syndrome, a long term, low dose antibiotic treatment is given on a continuous basis or after intercourse each time if intercourse appears to trigger symptoms.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As a hormonal imbalance may also be considered a source for urethral syndrome, [[hormone replacement therapy]] and [[oral contraceptive pill]] (birth-control pills) are also used to treat the symptoms of this condition.<ref name="urleMedicine - Urethral Syndrome : Article by Martha K Terris">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3081.htm |title=eMedicine - Urethral Syndrome : Article by Martha K Terris |work= |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>
