'''Arthur Krigsman''', MD, is a [[pediatrician]] and [[gastroenterologist]] best known for his [[MMR vaccine controversy|controversial]] and widely-criticized research in which he attempted to prove that the [[MMR vaccine]] caused  diseases, especially [[autism]].  He specializes in the evaluation and treatment of gastrointestinal pathology in children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, and has written in support of the controversial entity of [[autistic enterocolitis]]. The original study that tied the MMR vaccine to autism and GI complaints conducted by one of Krigsman's colleagues has been found to be fraudulent, and the diagnosis of "autistic enterocolitis" has never been widely accepted in the medical community.

==Education and career==

In 1989, Krigsman earned his [[Doctor of medicine|MD]] at the [[State University of New York]] at Brooklyn and later completed his pediatric residency at SUNY Brooklyn's Kings County Medical Center.  After completing pediatric gastroenterology [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in 1995, he joined the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology of [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] in New York as Director through 2000, and later joined [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] from 2000 through 2004 in the same position. He subsequently left to work as director of the gastroenterology clinic at [[Thoughtful House]], where he was colleagues with [[Andrew Wakefield]].   Krigsman holds [[board certification]] in general pediatrics and in pediatric gastroenterology, though no longer practices general pediatrics.<ref name=Vowell-Snyder>{{cite web|last=Vowell|first=Denise K.|title=Snyder v  HHS|url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/vaccine_files/Vowell.Snyder.pdf|publisher=Office of Special Masters, United States Court of Special Claims|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> In April 2010, Krigsman left Thoughtful House to open a private practice in Austin and New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pediatric Gastroenterology of New York and Texas|url=http://www.autismgi.com/|accessdate=4 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110128195748/http://autismgi.com/| archivedate= 28 January 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Ethics==

In 2004, Krigsman left Lenox Hill under "questionable circumstances," after his hospital privileges were restricted from conducting [[endoscopy|endoscopies]] due to allegations that he was performing medically unwarranted endoscopies on autistic children for research purposes.<ref name=Hastings-Cedillo>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=George L.|title=Cedillo v HHS|url=ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf|publisher=Office of Special Masters, United States Court of Special Claims|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>   The [[Department of Health and Human Services]] Office for Human Research Protections later reviewed the situation, noting reports from the hospital that Krigsman applied for permission to conduct research but was not approved by the institution's [[Institutional Review Board]], which was concerned about risk to patients from unwarranted procedures.  The report also noted Krigsman nevertheless testified before a [[Congressional hearing]] about research he had done on 43 patients, and later refused to provide medical charts as requested by a committee set up by the hospital to investigate the situation, before resigning from the hospital in 2004.<ref name=DHHS>{{cite web|last=McNeilly|first=Patrick J.|title=Letter to Lenox Hill Hospital|url=http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR06/nov06a.pdf|publisher=Office for Human Research Protections, DHHS|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>

In 2005, Krigsman was fined by the [[Texas Medical Board|Texas State Board of Medical Examiners]] for multiple violations, including representing he was available to see patients prior to obtaining his [[medical license]] in Texas, for failing to report previous regulatory sanctions by the Florida medical board, and for the disciplinary action by the Lenox Hill Hospital.<ref name=Hastings-Cedillo />

== Controversial autism research ==

The concept of autistic enterocolitis was coined by [[Andrew Wakefield]] in 1998 after the now-retracted publication of his study in ''[[The Lancet]]'', where he purported an association between autistic regression, [[intestinal]] [[inflammation]] and the MMR vaccine.<ref>{{cite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A ''et al.'' |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–41 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |pmid=9500320 |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927010149/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Retracted paper|intentional=yes}}</ref> In 2003, Krigsman, who was at Lenox Hill, reported similar findings as those of Wakefield, saying he found the intestines of 40 autistic children showed signs of inflammation, thus lending support to Wakefield's ideas that MMR was related to autism and also to gastrointestinal disease.<ref name=Begley>{{Cite news | last = Begley | first = Sharon | title = Anatomy of a Scare | magazine = Newsweek | date = 21 February 2009  | url =http://www.newsweek.com/2009/02/20/anatomy-of-a-scare.html  | accessdate = 4 February 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110120123754/http://www.newsweek.com/2009/02/20/anatomy-of-a-scare.html| archivedate= 20 January 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  This information was not formally published until seven years later in 2010, in the non-[[MEDLINE#Inclusion of journals|MEDLINE]] indexed journal ''[[Autism Insights]]''.<ref name=AutismInsights>{{cite journal|last=Krigsman|first=A|coauthors=Boris M, Goldblatt A, Stott C|title=Clinical Presentation and Histologic Findings at Ileocolonoscopy in Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Chronic Gastrointestinal Symptoms|journal=Autism Insights|date=1 January 2010|volume=2|pages=1–11|doi=10.4137/AUI.S3252|url=http://www.la-press.com/clinical-presentation-and-histologic-findings-at-ileocolonoscopy-in-ch-article-a1816|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>

However, the concept of "autistic enterocolitis" has not been accepted in the medical community due to lack of rigorous studies confirming the condition, as many studies purportedly showing this diagnosis have been marred by numerous methodological faults.<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacDonald TT, Domizio P |title=Autistic enterocolitis; is it a histopathological entity? |journal=Histopathology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=371–9 |year=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.2007.02606.x |pmid=17257133}}</ref> Even a position statement by a panel of physicians sponsored by [[Autism Speaks]] that included Krigsman<ref>{{cite web|title=Autism Speaks Hosts Gastroenterology Workshop|url=http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science_news/autism_gastroenterology_conference.php|publisher=Autism Speaks|accessdate=4 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101229040722/http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science_news/autism_gastroenterology_conference.php| archivedate= 29 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  concluded that the clinical significance of the findings of inflammation in the intestines is unknown as it is also found in children without autism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Autism Speaks GI Statement|url=http://www.autismspeaks.org/docs/Autism_Speaks_GI_Statement_1-07.pdf|publisher=Autism Speaks|accessdate=4 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101229031903/http://www.autismspeaks.org/docs/Autism_Speaks_GI_Statement_1-07.pdf| archivedate= 29 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Andrew Wakefield, who later joined and worked with Krigsman at Thoughtful House, was found to have falsified the 1998 Lancet study, which was described as "an elaborate fraud."<ref name=Deer2011>{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ| year=2011| volume=342| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347| pmid=21209059}}</ref><ref name=BMJ2011>{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume= 342:c7452 |title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |author= Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}</ref>

==Expert witness testimony==

Krigsman has testified as an [[expert witness]] in a number of test claims to the Office of Special Masters of the [[U.S. Court of Federal Claims]] (commonly known as the "[[Vaccine Court]]") by parents seeking compensation for damages purportedly caused by vaccination.  The "[[Special master|Special Masters]]" rendering decisions about these cases have questioned his credibility due to previous regulatory sanctions by the Texas Medical Board and Lenox Hill Hospital, as well as concerns regarding the ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' provided by Krigsman.  They noted concerns regarding a title he said he held at New York University Medical School which may not have matched his duties as well as possible misrepresentations of publications he has published.<ref name=Vowell-Snyder /><ref name=Hastings-Cedillo />  In one case, the judge noted that he thinks Krigsman was not a "credible witness" and that the parents who brought the case were "misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment."<ref name=Hastings-Cedillo /> In another case, the judge noted of Krigsman's qualification for identifying a new disease like "autistic enterocolitis" which is "unrecognized by other authorities in the field, were, even when inflated, sadly lacking" and that his testimony about the existence of "autistic enterocolitis" was "speculative and unsupported by the weight of the evidence."<ref name=Vowell-Snyder />
