The '''body of the [[Human sternum|sternum]]''' ('''gladiolus'''), considerably lengthier, narrower, and thinner than the [[manubrium]], attains its greatest breadth close to the lower end.

==  Surfaces ==
Its '''anterior surface''' is nearly flat, directed upward and forward, and marked by three transverse ridges which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. It affords attachment on either side to the sternal origin of the [[Pectoralis major]]. At the junction of the third and fourth pieces of the body is occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen, of varying size and form. 

The '''posterior surface''', slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines, less distinct, however, than those in front; from its lower part, on either side, the [[Transversus thoracis]] takes origin.

==  Borders ==
The '''superior border''' is oval and articulates with the [[manubrium]], the junction of the two forming the [[sternal angle]] (''angulus Ludovici''). 

The '''inferior border''' is narrow, and articulates with the [[xiphoid process]]. 

Each '''lateral border''', at its superior angle, has a small facet, which with a similar facet on the manubrium, forms a cavity for the cartilage of the second rib; below this are four angular depressions which receive the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, while the inferior angle has a small facet, which, with a corresponding one on the xiphoid process, forms a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib. These articular depressions are separated by a series of curved interarticular intervals, which diminish in length from above downward, and correspond to the intercostal spaces. Most of the [[Costal cartilage|cartilage]]s belonging to the [[true rib]]s, as will be seen from the foregoing description, articulate with the sternum at the lines of junction of its primitive component segments. This is well seen in many of the lower animals, where the parts of the bone remain ununited longer than in man.
