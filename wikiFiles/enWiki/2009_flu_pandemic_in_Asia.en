China's Ministry of Health has gathered experts to draft the Influenza A(H1N1) vaccine and immunity strategy which would include, 'when, how and against whom' the vaccine should be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=421736|title=China To Draft Flu Vaccine And Immunity Strategy|publisher=Bernama|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>
The ministry's Contingency Office deputy director, Liang Wannian, said the optimum objective of the flu vaccine was for the protection of high-risk population, especially people with basic illness and pregnant women. The first batch of China's A (H1N1) flu vaccine is expected to be ready by July, and would undergo a two-month clinical test before it is available in the market. China's flu vaccine strategy is to stockpile enough vaccine for one per cent of her population by October 1, as a preventive measure to encounter any vast outbreak of the flu. Liang said China would take more severe and effective preventive measures at its many gateways and educate the people on the H1N1, also known as swine flu.

In early September 2009, China's [[State Food and Drug Administration]] granted approval to a homegrown [[swine influenza|swine flu]] vaccine, which producer [[Sinovac Biotech]] claims is effective after only one dose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/03/content_11990303.htm|publisher=Xinhua|title=China's Sinovac gets world's first production license for A/H1N1 flu vaccine|accessdate=2009-09-08|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jgeZrXkH|archivedate=2009-09-10}}</ref><ref>[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/china-approves-homegrown-swine-flu-vaccine-20090903-f9cr.html (''The Sydney Morning Herald'')]</ref>

The [[Politics of Laos|Lao government]] agreed to buy 10 thermal imaging machines and install them at the country's major immigration border checkpoints. The machines would help officials identify anyone entering the country with a high temperature and create confidence among Lao people, foreigners living in [[Laos]] and people traveling to Laos. Health officials would be on hand at international border checkpoints to ensure anyone found to be infected could be treated immediately. Each machine could cost about US$25,000. The decision to buy them was made after the government found visitors to Laos included people coming from the United States, Spain and other affected countries.

The Prime Minister [[Bouasone Bouphavanh]] said masks should be made available and health officials would be assigned to work at border checkpoints. The machines would help officials identify anyone entering the country with a high temperature and create confidence among Lao people, foreigners living in Laos and people travelling to Laos.

Mongolian authorities quarantined 103 plane passengers on last May 7 who may have been exposed to swine flu.

The passengers were aboard a flight in which two passengers who had performed in a Mongolian band in Mexico developed a fever. When the plane stopped for a scheduled landing in Moscow, the ill passengers were hospitalized.

Landing later in [[Ulaanbaatar]], the Mongolian Health Ministry announced it had quarantined all passengers as well as the crew of six. The people will remain under medical surveillance for seven days, according to officials of the General Authority for Emergency Management.

The Mongolian Health Ministry has sought to prevent the spread of swine flu in Mongolia by urging people to avoid public places.<ref>[http://www.mongolia-web.com/health/2384-mongolia-quarantines-air-passengers-following-swine-flu-alert- Mongolia quarantines air passengers following swine flu alert | Mongolia Web News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Most defectors with backgrounds in health care agree that, considering the isolation of North Korean society and its highly inadequate health care system, incidents of swine flu are likely to be either suppressed or merely misdiagnosed.

Following the confirmation of the first case of the disease in Mongolia, heightened concerns arose. the very high cases in China would make the spread of the disease to North Korea only a matter of time. If swine flu would come to North Korea, there is a possibility of rapid spreading of the disease through the jangmadang (market), which has become the primary means of survival for the people.

On December 1, the Ministry of Public Health called on a meeting to discuss how to prevent H1N1 influenza from spreading. Importing of vaccines and isolation of people in their respective homes were considered. The Ministry of Education has also decided to call on all schools nation-wide to have a winter break a month earlier in an approach to stop the spread of the disease due to the fact that the majority of fatalities caused by the disease are people younger than 23 years of age.<ref name="goodfriendsusa.blogspot.com">[http://goodfriendsusa.blogspot.com/2009/12/north-korea-today-no-311no311-1-hot.html North Korea Today No. 311/No.311-1 Hot Topics December 2009].
