'''Human embryology''' is the study of human development during the first eight weeks from [[gametogenesis]] ([[sperm]] and [[oocyte]] development) through [[fertilisation|fertilization]] (fusion of sperm and oocyte) up to 8 weeks after implantation of the [[zygote]] (fertilized egg) into the uterus. After the 8th week of implantation, the developing embryo becomes a [[fetus]]. Usually, most individuals spend the first nine months (38 weeks or 266 days) of life within the uterus of the mother.

'''Human embryogenesis''' is the process of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the human [[embryo]] that occurs during early stages of development. From a biological standpoint, human development is a continuum, starting with the [[germ cell|germ cells]] ([[ovum]] and [[spermatozoon]]), through fertilization, prenatal development, and growth to adulthood. The germinal stage, refers to ovum (egg) prior to fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until the time of implantation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Human Development |publisher=McGraw Hill College|location=New York, NY |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0072820300 |edition=9th |chapter=Prenatal Development}}</ref>   

During this stage, the fertilization creates a single-celled zygote, which is defined as an embyro because it contains a full complement of genetic material.   In humans, the embryo is referred to as a fetus in the later stages of prenatal development.  The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring either 8 weeks after fertilization or 8 weeks after implantation. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features, and a more complete set of developing internal organs. The entire process involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in gene expression, cell growth and differentiation. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.

== Fertilization ==

[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|550px|The initial stages of human embyogenesis.]]

[[Human fertilization]] is the union of a female oocyte (egg) and male sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube to form the [[zygote]] (single diploid cell). It constitutes the penetration of the oocyte (egg) by a sperm succeeded by fusion of their genetic material. This genetic material consists of the 23 chromosomes contained in the nucleus of the ovum and 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitosis|mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of an embryo having two cells. The fertilized ovum thus begins to divide into several cells, i.e. it starts to undergo [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. The two daughter cells are still surrounded by [[zona pellucida]].

== Cleavage ==

A human develops from a single diploid cell called a [[zygote]], which results from the fusion of two [[gamete|reproductive cells]]; an [[ovum]] (egg) being [[fertilisation|fertilized]] by a single [[spermatozoon]] ([[sperm]]). The cell is surrounded by a strong membrane of [[glycoprotein]]s called the ''[[zona pellucida]]'' (membrane derived from the ovum) which the successful sperm has managed to penetrate.

The zygote undergoes [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], increasing the number of cells within the zona pellucida. After the 8-cell stage, embryos undergo what is called '''compaction''', where the cells [[cell junction|bind]] tightly to each other, forming a compact sphere. After compactation, the embryo is in the [[morula]] stage (32 cells). '''Cavitation''' occurs next, where the outermost layer of cells - the [[trophoblast]] - secrete fluid into the morula. 

As a consequence of this, when the number of cells reaches 40 to 150, a central, fluid-filled cavity ([[blastocoele|blastocoel]]) has been formed. The [[zona pellucida]] begins to degenerate, allowing the embryo to increase its volume. This stage in the developing embryo, reached after four to six days, is the [[blastocyst]] (akin to the [[blastula]] stage), and lasts approximately until [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] in the uterus, and is referred to as the preimplantation phase of development.

Each cell of the preimplantation embryo is [[cell potency|totipotent]]. That is, each cell has the potential to form all of the different cell types in the developing embryo. This [[cell potency|totipotency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD), whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's [[uterus]].

== Blastocyst differentiation ==

[[File:Blastocyst English.svg|thumb|350px|Blastocyst with an [[inner cell mass]] and [[trophoblast]].]]

The [[blastocyst]] is characterized by a group of cells, called the [[inner cell mass]] (also called [[inner cell mass|embryoblast]]) and the mentioned trophoblast (the outer cells), and a blastocyst cavity (blastocoel).

The inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the trophoblast will eventually form the [[placenta]]. The blastocyst can be thought of as a ball of a (mostly single) layer of [[trophoblast]] cells, with the inner cell mass attached to this ball's inner wall. The embryo plus its [[Cell membrane|membrane]]s is called the [[conceptus]]. By this stage the conceptus is in the [[uterus]]. The zona pellucida ultimately disappears completely, allowing the blastocyst to invade the endometrium, performing [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

=== Implantation ===
{{Main|Implantation (human embryo)}}

The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into two distinct layers: the inner is the [[cytotrophoblast]] (containing cell boundaries) consisting of [[cuboidal]] cells that are the source of dividing [[cell (biology)|cells]], and the outer is the [[syncytiotrophoblast]] (no cell boundaries).

The syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the [[endometrium]] (innermost [[epithelium|epithelial]] lining) of the uterus by forming finger-like projections called [[chorionic villi]] that make their way into the uterus, and spaces called ''[[lacunae]]'' that fill up with the mother's blood. This is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), a [[hormone]] that "notifies" the mother's body that she is [[pregnant]], preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the [[corpus luteum]]. The villi begin to branch, and contain blood vessels of the [[fetus]] that allow [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] between mother and child.

== Inner cell mass differentiation ==

While the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate into the wall of the uterus, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops.

The embryoblast forms a [[bilaminar]] (two layered) embryo, composed of the ''[[epiblast]]'' and the ''hypoblast''. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity, and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast, now called ''primitive ectoderm'' will perform [[gastrulation]], approximately at day 16 (week 3) after fertilization. In this process, it gives rise to all three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The hypoblast, or ''primitive endoderm'', will give rise to extraembryonic structures only, such as the lining of the primary (primitive) yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity).

== Cavity formation ==

By separating from the trophoblast, the epiblast forms a new cavity, the ''amniotic cavity''. This is lined by the amnionic membrane, with cells that come from the epiblast (called ''amnioblasts''). Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called ''[[Heuser's membrane]]'' (or ''exocoelomic membrane''), and the blastocoel is now called the ''primary yolk sac'' (or ''exocoelomic cavity'').

Cytotrophoblast cells and cells of Heuser's membrane continue secreting extracellular matrix between them. This matrix is called the ''extraembryonic reticulum''. Cells of the epiblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the ''extraembryonic mesoderm'', which makes it difficult to maintain the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the ''chorionic cavity'' or ''[[extraembryonic coelom]]''.

Another layer of cells leaves the hypoblast and migrates along the inside of the primary yolk sac. The primary yolk sac is pushed to the opposite side of the embryo (the ''abembryonic pole''), while a new cavity forms, the ''secondary'' or ''definitive yolk sac''. The remnants of the primary yolk sac are called ''exocoelomic vesicles (exocoelomic cysts)''.

== Susceptibility ==

Toxic exposures during the first two weeks following fertilization (second and third weeks of gestational age) may cause prenatal death but do not cause developmental defects. Instead, the body performs a [[miscarriage]]. On the other hand, subsequent toxic exposures in the embryonic period often cause major [[congenital malformation]]s, since the precursors of the major organ systems are developing.
