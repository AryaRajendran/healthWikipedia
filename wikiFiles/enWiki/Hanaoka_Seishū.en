{{Nihongo|'''Hanaoka Seishū'''|華岡 青洲||October 23, 1760 &ndash; November 21, 1835}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[surgeon]] of the [[Edo period]] with a knowledge of [[Chinese herbology|Chinese herbal medicine]], as well as Western surgical techniques he had learned through ''[[Rangaku]]'' (literally "Dutch learning", and by extension "Western learning"). Hanaoka is said to have been the first to perform [[surgery]] using [[general anesthesia]].

==History==
Hanaoka studied medicine in Kyoto, and became a medical practitioner in Wakayama prefecture, located near Osaka, where he was born. Seishū Hanaoka learned traditional Japanese medicine as well as [[Rangaku|Dutch-imported]] European surgery. Due to the nation's self-imposed isolation policy of ''[[Sakoku]]'',<ref name=Toby1977/> few foreign medical texts were permitted into Japan at that time. This limited the exposure of Hanaoka and other Japanese physicians to Western medical developments.

Perhaps the most notable Japanese surgeon of the Edo period, Hanaoka was famous for combining Dutch and Japanese surgery and introducing modern surgical techniques to Japan.<ref name=Mestler1956/> Hanaoka successfully operated for [[hydrocele]], [[anal fistula]], and even performed certain kinds of [[plastic surgery]]. He was the first surgeon in the world who used the general anaesthesia in surgery and who dared to operate on cancers of the [[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[Oral cancer|oropharynx]], to remove [[Necrosis|necrotic]] bone, and to perform [[amputation]]s of the extremities in Japan.<ref name=Mestler1956/>

==Hua Tuo and mafeisan==
[[File:HuaTuo.jpg|thumb|[[Hua Tuo]], Chinese [[surgeon]], circa AD 200]]
{{Main|Hua Tuo}}

[[Hua Tuo]] (華, ca. AD 145-220) was a Chinese [[surgeon]] of the 2nd century AD. According to the ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' (ca. AD 270) and the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (ca. AD 430), Hua Tuo performed surgery under general anesthesia using a formula he had developed by mixing wine with a mixture of [[herbal extract]]s he called ''[[Hua Tuo#Mafeisan|mafeisan]]'' (麻沸散).<ref name=Chu2004/> Hua Tuo reportedly used mafeisan to perform even major operations such as [[Segmental resection|resection]] of [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] [[intestines]].<ref name=Chu2004/><ref name=Giles1897/><ref name=Giles1948/> Before the surgery, he administered an oral anesthetic [[potion]], probably dissolved in wine, in order to induce a state of [[unconsciousness]] and partial [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blockade]].<ref name=Chu2004/>

The exact composition of mafeisan, similar to all of Hua Tuo's clinical knowledge, was lost when he burned his manuscripts, just before his death.<ref name=Chen2008/> The composition of the anesthetic powder was not mentioned in either the ''Records of Three Kingdoms'' or the ''Book of the Later Han''. Because [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings regarded the body as [[sacred]] and surgery was considered a form of body mutilation, surgery was strongly discouraged in [[History of China#Ancient era|ancient China]]. Because of this, despite Hua Tuo's reported success with general anesthesia, the practice of surgery in ancient China ended with his death.<ref name=Chu2004/>

The name ''mafeisan'' combines ''ma'' ([[Wikt:麻|麻]], meaning "cannabis, [[hemp]], [[Anesthesia|numbed]] or [[Paresthesia|tingling]]"), ''fei'' ([[Wikt:沸|沸]], meaning "[[boiling]] or bubbling"), and ''san'' ([[Wikt:散|散]], meaning "to break up or scatter", or "medicine in powder form"). Therefore, the word ''mafeisan'' probably means something like "cannabis boil powder". Many [[Sinology|sinologist]]s and scholars of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] have guessed at the composition of Hua Tuo's mafeisan powder, but the exact components still remain unclear. His formula is believed to have contained some combination of:<ref name=Chu2004/><ref name=Chen2008/><ref name=Wang1999/><ref name=Fu2002/>
*''bai zhi'' (''[[Angelica|Angelica dahurica]]''),
*''cao wu'' (草烏, ''[[Wikispecies:Aconitum kusnezoffii|Aconitum kusnezoffii]]'', ''[[Aconitum|Aconitum kusnezoffii]]'', ''Kusnezoff's monkshood'', or ''wolfsbane'' root),
*''chuān xiōng'' (''[[Ligusticum wallichii]]'', or ''Szechuan lovage''),
*''dong quai'' (''[[Angelica sinensis]]'', or ''"female [[ginseng]]"''),
*''wu tou'' (烏頭, ''[[Aconitum carmichaelii]], rhizome of ''Aconitum'', or Chinese monkshood"),
*''yang jin hua'' (洋金花, ''[[Wikispecies:Datura metel|Flos Daturae metelis]]'', or ''[[Datura stramonium]]'', ''jimson weed'', ''devil's trumpet'', ''thorn apple'', ''locoweed'', ''moonflower''),
*''ya pu lu'' (''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'')
*[[rhododendron]] flower, and
*[[jasmine]] root.
Others have suggested the potion may have also contained [[hashish]],<ref name=Giles1897/> [[bhang]],<ref name=Giles1948/> ''shang-luh'',<ref name=Gordon1949/> or opium.<ref name=Veith1972/> [[Victor H. Mair]] wrote that ''mafei'' "appears to be a transcription of some [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word related to "morphine"."<ref name=Mair2000/> Some authors believe that Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by [[acupuncture]], and that mafeisan either had nothing to do with or was simply an adjunct to his strategy for anesthesia.<ref name=Lu2002/> Many physicians have attempted to re-create the same formulation based on historical records but none have achieved the same clinical efficacy as Hua Tuo's. In any event, Hua Tuo's formula did not appear to be effective for major operations.<ref name=Mair2000/><ref name=Wai2004/>

==Formulation of tsūsensan==
[[File:Datura_stramonium_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-051.jpg|thumb|''[[Datura stramonium]]'', also known as ''Korean morning glory'', ''thorn apple'' or ''jimson weed'')]]

Hanaoka was intrigued when he learned about Hua Tuo's mafeisan potion. Beginning in about 1785, Hanaoka embarked on a quest to re-create a compound that would have pharmacologic properties similar to Hua Tuo's mafeisan.<ref name=Izuo2004/> His wife, who participated in his experiments as a volunteer, lost her sight due to adverse side effects. After years of research and experimentation, he finally developed a formula which he named ''tsūsensan'' (also known as ''mafutsu-san''). Like that of Hua Tuo, this compound was composed of extracts of several different plants, including:<ref name=Ogata1973/><ref name=Hyodo1992/><ref name=BLTC/>
*8 parts ''yang jin hua'' (''[[Datura stramonium]]'', ''Korean morning glory'', ''thorn apple'', ''jimson weed'', ''devil's trumpet'', ''stinkweed'', or ''locoweed'');
*2 parts ''bai zhi'' (''[[Angelica|Angelica dahurica]]'');
*2 parts ''cao wu'' (''[[Aconitum|Aconitum sp.]]'', ''monkshood'' or ''wolfsbane'');
*2 parts ''chuān ban xia'' (''[[Pinellia ternata]]'');
*2 parts ''chuān xiōng'' (''[[Ligusticum wallichii]]'', ''Cnidium rhizome'', ''Cnidium officinale'' or ''Szechuan lovage'');
*2 parts ''dong quai'' (''[[Angelica sinensis]]'' or ''female [[ginseng]]'');
*1 part ''tian nan xing'' (''[[Arisaema|Arisaema rhizomatum]]'' or ''cobra lily'').

Some sources claim that ''[[Garden Angelica|Angelica archangelica]]'' (often referred to as ''garden angelica'', ''holy ghost'', or ''wild celery'') was also an ingredient.

Reportedly the mixture was ground to a paste, boiled in water, and administered as a drink. After 2 to 4 hours the patient would become insensitive to pain and then lapse into unconsciousness. Depending on the dosage, they might remain unconscious for 6–24 hours. The active ingredients in tsūsensan were [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], [[atropine]], [[aconitine]] and [[angelicotoxin]]. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produced a state of general anesthesia and [[skeletal muscle]] [[paralysis]].<ref name=BLTC/>

[[Shutei Nakagawa]] (1773–1850), a close friend of Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet entitled "Mayaku-ko" ("narcotic powder") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.<ref name=Matsuki1999/>

==Use of tsūsensan as a general anesthetic==
Once perfected, Hanaoka began to administer his new sedative drink to induce a state of consciousness equivalent to or approximating that of modern general anesthesia to his patients. Kan Aiya (藍屋勘) was a 60 year old woman whose family was beset by breast cancer - Kan being the last of her kin alive. On 13 October 1804, Hanaoka performed a partial [[mastectomy]] for [[breast cancer]] on Kan Aiya, using tsūsensan as a [[general anesthetic]]. This is regarded today by some as the first reliable documentation of an operation to be performed under general anesthesia.<ref name=Izuo2004/><ref name=Hyodo1992/><ref name=Perrin1979/><ref name=Matsuki2000/> Nearly forty years would pass before [[Crawford Long]] used general anesthesia in [[Danielsville, Georgia]].<ref name=Long1849/>

Hanaoka's success in performing this painless operation soon became widely known, and patients began to arrive from all parts of Japan. Hanaoka went on to perform many operations using tsūsensan, including resection of [[malignancy|malignant]] [[tumor]]s, extraction of [[Urolithiasis|bladder stones]], and extremity amputations. Before his death in 1835, Hanaoka performed more than 150 operations for breast cancer.<ref name=Izuo2004/><ref name=Matsuki2000/><ref name=Tominaga1994/><ref name=Matsuki2002/> He also devised and modified surgical instruments, and trained and educated many students, using his own philosophy for medical management. Hanaoka attracted many students, and his surgical techniques became known as the Hanaoka method.<ref name=Izuo2004/>

==Publications==
[[File:Image from "Surgical Casebook" by Hanaoka Seishu.jpg|thumb|Image from "Surgical Casebook" by Hanaoka Seishu]]

Hanaoka wrote the following works. It should be noted that none of these were printed books. Rather (as was the custom in Japan at that time), they were all handwritten manuscripts which were later reproduced by his students for their personal use.<ref name=Mestler1956/>
*1805: ''Nyuigan chiken-roku'', a one-volume book that provides a detailed description of Hanaoka's first operation for mammary carcinoma.
*1805: ''Nyugan saijo shujutsu-zu'', a one-volume book that provides a detailed description of Hanaoka's first operation for mammary carcinoma.
*1809: ''Nyuigan zufu'', an illustrated [[emakimono]] in one roll which also pictured breast cancer.
*1820: ''Geka tekiyio'', a one volume text.
*1838: ''Hanaoka-ke chiken zumaki'', an illustrated emakimono scroll depicting 86 different cases, including surgical resection of fibromas and [[elephantiasis]] of the genitalia.).
*Date unknown: ''Hanaoka-shi chijitsu zushiki'', a one-volume illustrated book that depicts his operations for the treatment of conditions such as [[phimosis]], [[arthritis]], necrosis, [[choanal atresia]], and [[hemorrhoid]]s.
*Date unknown: ''Seishuiidan'', a series of essays on Hanaoka's medical and surgical experiences.
*Date unknown: ''Yoka hosen'', a one volume text.
*Date unknown: ''Yoka shinsho'', a one volume text on surgery.
*Date unknown: ''Yoka sagen'', a two volume text on surgery.

The surgical teachings of Hanaoka were also preserved in a series of eight handwritten books by unnamed pupils, but known to us by the following titles: ''Shoka shinsho'', ''Shoka sagen'', ''Kinso yojutsu'', ''Kinso kuju'', ''Geka chakuyo'', ''Choso benmei'', ''Nyuiganben'', and ''Koho benran''. No dates are known for any of these writings. Since Hanaoka himself made only manuscript copies and none were ever published, it is doubtful if many copies of his surgical writings are now extant.<ref name=Mestler1956/>

==Legacy==
Though some of his patients are said to have benefited from Hanaoka's work, it apparently had no impact upon the development of general anesthesia in the rest of the world. The [[Sakoku|national isolation policy]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] prevented Hanaoka's achievements from being publicized until after the isolation ended in 1854. By that time, different techniques for general anesthesia had already been independently developed by American and European scientists and physicians. The [[Japan Society of Anesthesiologists]] however has incorporated a representation of the [[Datura stramonium|Korean morning glory]] flower in their [[logo]] in honor of Hanaoka's pioneering work.

Hanaoka's house has been preserved in his hometown (Naga-cho, [[Kinokawa, Wakayama]]). It has various interactive exhibits in both Japanese and English. It is adjacent to a nursing college, and many locally trained doctors and nurses pay homage to Hanaoka and his works.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Popular culture==
The Japanese author [[Sawako Ariyoshi]] wrote a novel entitled, ''[[The Doctor's Wife (Sawako Ariyoshi novel)|The Doctor's Wife]]'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''華岡青洲の妻''), based on the actual life of Hanaoka Seishū mixed with a fictional conflict between his mother and his wife. The novel was subsequently filmed as a 1967 movie directed by [[Yasuzo Masumura]], ''Hanaoka Seishū no tsuma'' (aka "The Wife of Seishu Hanaoka").
