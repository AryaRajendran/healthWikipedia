'''Standardized Kt/V''', also '''std Kt/V''', is a way of measuring ([[renal]]) [[dialysis adequacy]].  It was developed by [[Frank Gotch (MD)|Frank Gotch]] and is used in the [[USA]] to measure [[dialysis]].  Despite the name, it is quite different from [[Kt/V]].  In theory, both [[peritoneal dialysis]] and [[hemodialysis]] can be quantified with std Kt/V.

==Derivation==
Standardized Kt/V is motivated by the steady state solution of the mass transfer equation often used to approximate kidney function (equation ''1''), which is also used to define [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]].  

:<math>V \frac{dC}{dt} = -K \cdot C + \dot{m} \qquad(1)</math>

where
*<math>\dot{m}</math> is the mass generation rate of the substance - assumed to be a constant, i.e. not a function of time (equal to zero for foreign substances/drugs) [mmol/min] or [mol/s]
*t is dialysis time [min] or [s]
*V is the [[volume of distribution]] (total [[body water]]) [L] or [m<sup>3</sup>]
*K is the clearance [mL/min] or [m<sup>3</sup>/s]
*C is the concentration [mmol/L] or [mol/m<sup>3</sup>] (in the [[USA]] often [mg/mL])
From the above definitions it follows that <math>\frac{dC}{dt}</math> is the first [[derivative]] of concentration with respect to time, i.e. the change in concentration with time. 

Derivation equation ''1'' is described in the article [[clearance (medicine)]].

The solution of the above differential equation (equation 1) is

:<math>C = \frac{\dot{m}}{K} + \left(C_{o}-\frac{\dot{m}}{K}\right) e^{-\frac{K \cdot t}{V}} \qquad(2)</math>

where
*C<sub>o</sub> is the concentration at the beginning of dialysis [mmol/L] or [mol/m<sup>3</sup>]
*[[E (mathematical constant)|e]] is the base of the [[natural logarithm]]

The steady state solution is

:<math> C_{\infty} = \frac {\dot{m}}{K} \qquad(3a)</math>

This can be written as

:<math> K = \frac {\dot{m}}{C_{\infty}} \qquad(3b)</math>

Equation ''3b'' is the equation that defines [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]].  It is the motivation for K' (the equivalent clearance):

:<math> {K'}  = \frac {\dot{m}}{C_o} \qquad(4)</math>

where
*K' is the equivalent clearance [mL/min] or [m<sup>3</sup>/s]
*<math>\dot{m}</math> is the mass generation rate of the substance - assumed to be a constant, i.e. not a function of time [mmol/min] or [mol/s]
*C<sub>o</sub> is the concentration at the beginning of dialysis [mmol/L] or [mol/m<sup>3</sup>]

Equation ''4'' is normalized by the volume of distribution to form equation ''5'':

:<math> \frac {K'}{V}  = \frac {\dot{m}}{C_o \cdot V} \qquad(5)</math>

Equation ''5'' is multiplied by an arbitrary constant to form equation ''6'':

:<math> \mbox{const} \cdot \frac {K'}{V}  = \mbox{const} \cdot \frac {\dot{m}}{C_o \cdot V} \qquad(6)</math>

Equation ''6'' is then defined as standardized Kt/V (std Kt/V):

:<math>\mbox{std} \frac{K \cdot t}{V} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \mbox{const} \cdot \frac {\dot{m}}{C_o \cdot V} \qquad(7)</math><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gotch FA |title=The current place of urea kinetic modelling with respect to different dialysis modalities |journal=Nephrol Dial Transplant. |volume=13 Suppl 6 |issue= 90006|pages=10–4 |year=1998 |pmid=9719197 |doi= 10.1093/ndt/13.suppl_6.10|url=http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/suppl_6/10}}</ref><ref name=gotch_10936795>{{cite journal |author=Gotch FA, Sargent JA, Keen ML |title=Whither goest Kt/V? |journal=Kidney Int. Suppl. |volume=76 |issue= |pages=S3–18 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10936795 |doi= 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.07602.x|url=}}</ref>

where

* ''const'' is 7×24×60×60 seconds, the number of [[second]]s in a week.

==Interpretation of std Kt/V==
Standardized Kt/V can be interpreted as a concentration normalized by the mass generation per unit volume of body water.

Equation ''7'' can be written in the following way:

:<math>\mbox{std} \frac{K \cdot t}{V} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\mbox{ const} \cdot \frac {\dot{m}}{V} \frac{1}{C_o} \qquad(8)</math>

If one takes the inverse of Equation ''8'' it can be observed that the ''inverse of std Kt/V'' is proportional to the ''concentration of urea'' (in the body) divided by the ''production of urea per time'' per ''unit volume of body water''.

:<math>\left[ std \frac{K \cdot t}{V} \right]^{-1} \propto \frac{C_o}{\dot{m}/V} \qquad(9)</math>

==Comparison to Kt/V==
[[Kt/V]] and ''standardized Kt/V'' are not the same. Kt/V is a ratio of the pre- and post-dialysis urea concentrations. Standardized Kt/V is an equivalent clearance defined by the initial urea concentration (compare equation ''8'' and equation ''10'').

Kt/V is defined as (see article on [[Kt/V]] for derivation):

:<math> \frac{K \cdot t}{V} = \ln \frac{C_o}{C} \qquad(10)</math><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gotch FA, Sargent JA |title=A mechanistic analysis of the National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=526–34 |year=1985 |month=September |pmid=3934452 |doi= 10.1038/ki.1985.160|url=}}</ref>

Since Kt/V and std Kt/V are defined differently, Kt/V and std Kt/V values cannot be compared.

==Advantages of std Kt/V==
* Can be used to compare any dialysis schedule (i.e. [[nocturnal home hemodialysis]] vs. daily hemodialysis vs. conventional hemodialysis)
* Applicable to [[peritoneal dialysis]].
* Can be applied to patients with residual renal function; it is possible to demonstrate that C<sub>o</sub> is a function of the residual kidney function ''and'' the "cleaning" provided by dialysis.
* The model can be applied to substances other than urea, if the clearance, ''K'', and generation rate of the substance, <math>\dot{m}</math>, are known.<ref name=gotch_10936795/>

==Criticism/disadvantages of std Kt/V==
* It is complex and tedious to calculate, although [http://www.hdcn.com/calcf/ley.htm web-based calculators] are available to do this fairly easily.
* Many nephrologists have difficulty understanding it.
* [[Urea]] is not associated with toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson WJ, Hagge WW, Wagoner RD, Dinapoli RP, Rosevear JW |title=Effects of urea loading in patients with far-advanced renal failure |journal=Mayo Clinic Proc. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=21–9 |year=1972 |month=January |pmid=5008253 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
* Standardized Kt/V only models the clearance of urea and thus implicitly assumes the clearance of urea is comparable to other toxins.  It ignores molecules that (relative to urea) have [[diffusion|diffusion-limited]] transport - so called [[middle molecules]].
* It ignores the [[mass transfer]] between body compartments and across the [[plasma membrane]] (i.e. [[intracellular]] to [[extracellular]] transport), which has been shown to be important for the clearance of molecules such as [[phosphate]].
* The Standardized Kt/V is based on body water volume (V).  The [[Glomerular filtration rate]], an estimate of normal kidney function, is usually normalized to body surface area (S).  S and V differ markedly between small vs. large people and between men and women.  A man and a woman of the same S will have similar levels of GFR, but their values for V may differ by 15-20%.  Because standardized Kt/V incorporates residual renal function into the calculations, it makes the assumption that kidney function should scale by V.  This may disadvantage women and smaller patients of either sex, in whom V is decreased to a greater extent than S.

<math>stdKt/V = \frac { \frac {10080 \cdot (1 - e^{-eKt/V})}{t} }{ \frac {1 - e^{-eKtV}}{spKt/V} + \frac{10080}{N \cdot t} - 1} </math>

where ''stdKt/V'' is the standardized Kt/V <BR/>
''spKt/V'' is the single-pool Kt/V, computed as described in [[Kt/V]] section using a simplified equation or ideally, using urea modeling, and <BR>
''eKt/V'' is the equilibrated Kt/V, computed from the single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V) and session length (t) using, for example, the Tattersall equation:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tattersall JE, DeTakats D, Chamney P, Greenwood RN, Farrington K |title=The post-hemodialysis rebound: predicting and quantifying its effect on Kt/V |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=2094–102 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8943495 |doi= 10.1038/ki.1996.534|url=}}</ref>

<math>ekt/V = spKt/V \cdot \frac {t}{t+C}</math>

where ''t'' is session duration in minutes, and ''C'' is a time constant, which is specific for type of access and type solute being removed.  For urea, ''C'' should be 35 minutes for arterial access and 22 min for a venous access.

The regular "rate equation" <ref>{{cite journal |author=Daugirdas JT, Greene T, Depner TA, ''et al.'' |title=Factors that affect postdialysis rebound in serum urea concentration, including the rate of dialysis: results from the HEMO Study |journal=J Am Soc Nephrol. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=194–203 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14694173 |doi= 10.1097/01.ASN.0000103871.20736.0C|url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14694173}}</ref> also can be used to determine equilibrated Kt/V from the spKt/V, as long as session length is 120 min or longer.

==Plot showing std Kt/V depending on regular Kt/V for different treatment regimens ==
[[Image:Std ktv.svg#file|200 px|thumb|right|Plot relating standardized Kt/V, Kt/V and treatment frequency per week.]]
One can create a plot to relate the three grouping (standardized Kt/V, Kt/V, treatment frequency per week), sufficient to define a dialysis schedule. The equations are strongly dependent on session length; the numbers will change substantially between two sessions given at the same schedule, but with different session lengths.  For the present plot, a session length of 0.4 Kt/V units per hour was assumed, with a minimum dialysis session length of 2.0 hours.
