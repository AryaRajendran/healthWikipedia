'''Cerebral edema''' or '''cerebral œdema''' is an excess accumulation of fluid in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the [[brain]].

==Causes==
Trauma or injury can cause the rupture of cerebral blood vessels, which changes the water, sodium, and potassium levels inside the brain.  Water and sodium levels continue to rise in the first several days after injury, and regional cerebral ischemia can occur.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gotoh O, Asano T, Koide T, and Takakura K | title=Ischemic brain edema following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the rat: The time courses of the brain water, sodium and potassium contents and blood-brain barrier permeability to 125I-albumin | journal=Stroke | volume=16 | issue=1 | year=1985 | pages=101–109 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Shaw CM, Alvord EC, and Berry, RG | title=Swelling of the brain following ischemic infarction with arterial occlusion | journal=Archives of Neurology | volume=1 | year=1959 | pages=161–177 }}</ref>

==Symptoms==

Changes in morphology: Brain becomes soft, smooth, over filling the cranial vault; [[Gyri]] becomes flattened; [[sulci]] become narrowed and ventricular cavities become compressed.

As symptoms: nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, faintness. If herniation occurs, there can also be respiratory symptoms such as respiratory arrest due to compression of respiratory center.

==Research==
Recently, many studies on the mechanical properties of the brain edema have been conducted. Most are based on the technique of Finite Element Analysis (FEA), which is a widely-used numerical method in solid mechanics. For example, Gao and Ang used the FEA method to study changes in intracranial pressure during craniotomy operations.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Gao CP, Ang BT | title=Biomechanical modeling of decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injury | journal=Acta Neurochirurgica  | volume=102 | supplement | year=2008 | pages=279–282 }}</ref> The model corresponds well to clinical data. 
There are multiple advantages to using FEA. First, the cost of the numerical procedure is much less than that of cadaver experiments. Second, parameters can easily be modified using the computer model. Third, the numerical results can be useful in achieving insight and understanding of the disease process.  
However, due to the complicated theories of the nonlinear mechanics, some aspects of FEA, such as the constitutive equations and meshing process, still need to be improved to facilitate its use in research.

==Types==

Four types of [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[edema]] have been distinguished:<ref>{{cite journal | author=Qureshi AI, Suarez JI | title=Use of hypertonic saline solutions in treatment of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension | journal=Critical Care Medicine  | volume=28 | issue=9 | year=2000 | pages=3301–3313  | doi=10.1097/00003246-200009000-00032 |  pmid=11008996 }}</ref>

===Vasogenic===
Vasogenic edema occurs due to a breakdown of the tight endothelial junctions which make up the [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB). This allows intravascular proteins and fluid to penetrate into the parenchymal extracellular space.
Once plasma constituents cross the BBB, the edema spreads; this may be quite rapid and extensive. As water enters white matter it moves extracellularly along fiber tracts and can also affect the gray matter.
This type of edema may result from trauma, tumors, focal inflammation, late stages of cerebral [[ischemia]] and hypertensive [[encephalopathy]]. 

Mechanisms contributing to BBB dysfunction include physical disruption by [[arterial hypertension]] or trauma, and tumor-facilitated release of [[vasoactive]] and [[endothelial]] destructive compounds (e.g. [[arachidonic acid]], excitatory neurotransmitters, [[eicosanoids]], [[bradykinin]], [[histamine]], and [[free radicals]]). Subtypes of vasogenic edema include:

;Hydrostatic cerebral edema
:This form of cerebral edema is seen in acute, malignant hypertension. It is thought to result from direct transmission of pressure to cerebral [[capillaries]] with [[transudate|transudation]] of fluid from the [[capillaries]] into the [[fluid compartments|extravascular compartment]].

;Cerebral edema from brain cancer
:Cancerous [[glial cell]]s ([[glioma]]) of the brain can increase secretion of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), which weakens the junctions of the [[blood–brain barrier]]. [[Dexamethasone]] can be of benefit in reducing VEGF secretion.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heiss JD, Papavassiliou E, Merrill MJ, Nieman L, Knightly JJ, Walbridge S, Edwards NA, Oldfield EH | title= Mechanism of dexamethasone suppression of brain tumor-associated vascular permeability in rats. Involvement of the glucocorticoid receptor and vascular permeability factor | journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation  | volume=98 | issue=6 | year=1996 | pages=1400–1408  | url = http://www.jci.org/articles/view/118927 | doi=10.1172/JCI118927 | pmc=507566 |  pmid=8823305 }}</ref>

;High altitude cerebral edema
:[[High altitude cerebral edema]] (or '''[[HACE]]''') is a severe and sometimes fatal form of [[altitude sickness]]. HACE results from [[capillary]] fluid leakage due to the effects of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] on the [[mitochondria]]-rich [[endothelial cell]]s of the blood–brain barrier.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Van Osta A, Moraine JJ, Mélot C, Mairbäurl H, Maggiorini M, Naeije R | title=Effects of high altitude exposure on cerebral hemodynamics in normal subjects | journal=STROKE  | volume=36 | issue=3 | year=2005 | pages=557–560 | url = http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/3/557 | doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000155735.85888.13 |  pmid=15692117 }}</ref>

:Symptoms can include [[headache]], loss of coordination ([[ataxia]]), [[weakness]], [[disorientation]], [[memory loss]], [[psychotic]] symptoms ([[hallucinations]] and [[delusions]]), and [[coma]]. HACE generally occurs after a week or more at [[high altitude]]. If not treated quickly, severe cases can result in death. Immediate descent by 2,000 - 4,000 feet is a crucial life-saving measure. Medications such as [[dexamethasone]] can be prescribed for treatment in the field, but proper training in their use is required.  Anyone suffering from HACE should be evacuated to a medical facility for proper follow-up treatment. A [[Gamow bag]] can sometimes be used to stabilize the sufferer before transport or descending.

:Climbers may also suffer [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]), which affects the lungs. While not as life threatening as HACE in the initial stages, failure to descend to lower altitudes or receive medical treatment can also lead to death.

===Cytotoxic===
In cytotoxic edema, the BBB remains intact.
It occurs due to a disruption in cellular [[metabolism]] that impairs functioning of the sodium and potassium pump in the [[glial cell]] membrane, leading to cellular retention of [[sodium]] and water. Swollen astrocytes occur in gray and white matter. Cytotoxic edema is seen with various toxins, including [[dinitrophenol]], triethyltin, [[hexachlorophene]], and [[isoniazid]].  It can occur in [[Reye's syndrome]], severe [[hypothermia]], early [[ischemia]], [[encephalopathy]], early [[stroke]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], cardiac arrest, and pseudotumor cerebri.

During an [[ischemic stroke]], a lack of [[oxygen]] and [[glucose]] leads to a breakdown of the sodium-calcium pumps on brain cell membranes, which in turn results in a massive build up of sodium and calcium intracellularly.  This causes a rapid uptake of water and subsequent swelling of the cells.<ref name="Rosenberg 1999 209–16">{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Gary|title=Ischemic Brain Edema|journal=Progress in cardiovascular diseases|year=1999|volume=42|issue=3|pages=209–16|pmid=10598921}}</ref>  It is this swelling of the individual cells of the brain that is seen as the main distinguishing characteristic of cytotoxic edema, as opposed to vasogenic wherein the influx of fluid is typically seen in the interstitial space rather than within the cells themselves.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Klatzo|first=Igor|title=Pathophysiological aspects of brain edema|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|date=1 January 1987|month=09|volume=72|issue=3|pages=236–239|doi=10.1007/BF00691095}}</ref>  While not all patients who have experienced a stroke will develop a severe edema, those who do have a very poor prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hacke|first=W.|coauthors=Schwab, S.; Horn, M.; Spranger, M.; De Georgia, M.; von Kummer, R.|title='Malignant' Middle Cerebral Artery Territory Infarction: Clinical Course and Prognostic Signs|journal=Archives of Neurology|date=1 April 1996|volume=53|issue=4|pages=309–315|doi=10.1001/archneur.1996.00550040037012}}</ref>

In most instances, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema occur together.  It is generally accepted that cytotoxic edema is dominant immediately following an injury or infarct, but gives way to a vasogenic edema that can persist for several days or longer.<ref name="Rosenberg 1999 209–16"/>  The use of specific MRI techniques has allowed for some differentiation between the two mechanisms and suggests that in the case of trauma, the cytotoxic response dominates <ref>{{cite journal|last=Barzó|first=P|coauthors=Marmarou, A; Fatouros, P; Hayasaki, K; Corwin, F|title=Contribution of vasogenic and cellular edema to traumatic brain swelling measured by diffusion-weighted imaging.|journal=Journal of neurosurgery|date=1997 Dec|volume=87|issue=6|pages=900–7|pmid=9384402}}</ref>

===Osmotic===
Normally, the [[osmolality]] of cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) and extracellular fluid (ECF) in the brain is slightly lower than that of plasma. Plasma can be diluted by several mechanisms, including excessive water intake (or [[hyponatremia]]), [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] secretion (SIADH), [[hemodialysis]], or rapid reduction of blood [[glucose]] in hyper[[osmolar]] [[hyperglycemic]] state (HHS), formerly hyperosmolar non-ketotic acidosis (HONK). Plasma dilution decreases serum osmolality, resulting in a higher osmolality in the brain compared to the serum.  This creates an abnormal pressure gradient and movement of water into the brain, causing edema.

===Interstitial===
Interstitial edema occurs in obstructive hydrocephalus due to a rupture of the CSF-brain barrier.  This results in trans-ependymal flow of CSF, causings CSF to penetrate the brain and spread to the extracellular spaces and the white matter. Interstitial cerebral edema differs from vasogenic edema as CSF contains almost no protein.

==Treatment==
Treatment approaches can include [[osmotherapy]] using [[mannitol]], [[diuretics]] and [[Decompressive craniectomy|surgical decompression]].<ref name="pmid17613230">{{cite journal |author=Raslan A, Bhardwaj A |title=Medical management of cerebral edema |journal=Neurosurgical focus |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=E12 |year=2007 |pmid=17613230|doi=10.3171/foc.2007.22.5.13}}</ref>
