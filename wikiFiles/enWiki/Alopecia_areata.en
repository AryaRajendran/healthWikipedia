'''Alopecia areata''' ('''AA''') is a condition in which [[hair loss|hair is lost]] from some or all areas of the body, usually from the [[scalp]].<ref name="Andrews">{{Cite book|author=Odom, Richard B.; Davidsohn, Israel; James, William D.; Henry, John Bernard; Berger, Timothy G.; Clinical diagnosis by laboratory methods; Dirk M.

In 1–2% of cases, the condition can spread to the entire scalp ([[alopecia totalis]]) or to the entire [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] ([[alopecia universalis]]).

==Classification==
Commonly, alopecia areata involves hair loss in one or more round spots on the scalp.<ref name=draelos/><ref name="Lookingbill">Marks, James G; Miller, Jeffery (2006). ''Lookingbill and Marks' Principles of Dermatology'' (4th ed.). Elsevier Inc. ISBN 1-4160-3185-5.</ref>

* Hair may also be lost more diffusely over the whole scalp, in which case the condition is called '''diffuse alopecia areata'''.<ref name=draelos/>
* '''Alopecia areata monolocularis''' describes baldness in only one spot. It may occur anywhere on the head.
* '''Alopecia areata multilocularis''' refers to multiple areas of hair loss.
* The disease may be limited only to the beard, in which case it is called '''alopecia areata barbae'''.<ref name=draelos/>
* If the patient loses all the hair on the scalp, the disease is then called '''alopecia totalis'''.
* If all body hair, including [[pubic hair]], is lost, the diagnosis then becomes '''alopecia universalis'''.<ref name=WebMD>[http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/alopecia-areata Skin Conditions: Alopecia Areata]. WebMD. Retrieved on December 2, 2007.</ref>
Alopecia areata totalis and universalis are rare.<ref name=WebMD/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Alopecia areata.jpg|thumbnail|left|Alopecia areata]]
Typical first symptoms of AA are small bald patches. The underlying skin is unscarred and looks superficially normal. These patches can take many shapes, but are most usually round or oval.<ref name="Fitz2">{{Cite book|author=Freedberg, Irwin M.; Fitzpatrick, Thomas B. |title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-07-138076-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>  AA most often affects the scalp and beard,  but may occur on any hair-bearing part of the body.<ref name=merck/>  Different skin areas can exhibit hair loss and regrowth at the same time. The disease may also go into remission for a time, or may be permanent.  It is common in children.

The area of hair loss may tingle or be painful.<ref name=aocd>American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. [http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/alopecia_areata.html Alopecia Areata.] Dermatologic Disease Database. Aocd.org. Retrieved on December 3, 2007.</ref>

The hair tends to fall out over a short period of time, with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other.<ref name=draelos/>

Exclamation point hairs, narrower along the length of the strand closer to the base, producing a characteristic "exclamation point" appearance, are often present.<ref name=draelos/>

When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp.  In cases of AA, hair will tend to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 

Nails may have pitting or [[trachyonychia]].<ref name=merck/>

==Diagnosis==

Alopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on clinical features.

[[Trichoscopy]] may aid differential diagnosis. In AA, trichoscopy shows regularly distributed "yellow dots" ([[hyperkeratotic]] plugs), small exclamation-mark hairs, and  "black dots" (destroyed hairs in the hair follicle opening).<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Rudnicka L, Olszewska M, Rakowska A, aloo Kowalska-Oledzka E, Slowinska M. |title= Trichoscopy: a new method for diagnosing hair loss |journal= J Drugs Dermatol |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=651–654 |year=2008 |pmid=18664157 }}</ref>

A biopsy is rarely needed in AA. [[Histologic]] findings include [[peribulbar]] [[Lymphocytic infiltration|lymphocytic infiltrate]] ("swarm of bees"). Occasionally, in inactive AA, no inflammatory infiltrates are found. Other helpful findings include [[pigment incontinence]] in the [[hair bulb]] and [[follicular]] [[stelae]], and a shift in the [[anagen]]-to-[[telogen]] ratio towards telogen.

==Causes==
Alopecia areata is not [[Infectious disease|contagious]].<ref name=draelos/>  It occurs more frequently in people who have affected family members, suggesting [[heredity]] may be a factor.<ref name=draelos/> Strong evidence of genetic association with increased risk for AA was found by studying families with two or more affected members. This study identified at least four regions in the genome that are likely to contain these genes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Martinez-Mir A |title=Genomewide Scan for Linkage Reveals Evidence of Several Susceptibility Loci for Alopecia Areata |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=316–28 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17236136 |pmc=1785354 |doi=10.1086/511442|author-separator=,|author2=Zlotogorski A|author3=Gordon D|display-authors=3|last4=Petukhova|first4=Lynn|last5=Mo|first5=Jianhong|last6=Gilliam|first6=T. Conrad|last7=Londono|first7=Douglas|last8=Haynes|first8=Chad|last9=Ott|first9=Jurg}}</ref>  In addition, it is slightly more likely to occur in people who have relatives with [[autoimmune disease]]s.<ref name=WebMD/>

The condition is thought to be an [[autoimmune disorder]] in which the body attacks its own [[hair follicle]]s and suppresses or stops hair growth.<ref name=draelos/> For example, [[T cell]] [[lymphocytes]] cluster around affected follicles, causing inflammation and subsequent hair loss. A few cases of babies being born with [[congenital]] AA have been reported, but these are not cases of autoimmune disease, because an infant is born without a fully developed immune system.

Also, some evidence indicates AA affects the part of the hair follicle associated with hair color. Hair that has turned gray may not be affected.

==Treatment==
If the affected region is small, it is reasonable just to observe the progression of the illness, as the problem often spontaneously regresses and the hair may grow back.

In cases of severe hair loss, limited success has been shown from treating AA with the corticosteroids [[clobetasol]] or [[fluocinonide]], corticosteroid injections, or cream. The cream however is not as effective and it takes longer in order to see results. Steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost. Whether they are effective is uncertain. Some other medications used are [[minoxidil]], Elocon (mometasone) ointment (steroid cream), irritants (anthralin or topical coal tar), and topical immunotherapy [[cyclosporine]], sometimes in different combinations.  Topical corticosteroids frequently fail to enter the skin deeply enough to affect the hair bulbs, which are the treatment target,<ref name=merck/> and small lesions typically also regrow spontaneously.  Oral corticosteroids decrease the hair loss, but only for the period during which they are taken, and these drugs have serious [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effects]].<ref name=merck/>

For small patches on the beard or head, suppression with topical [[tacrolimus]] ointments, such as Protopic, are possible. Symptoms may remain suppressed until aggravated by stress or other factors.

In one small study without a control group, [[diphenylcyclopropenone]] has shown a significant hair regrowth in 40% of patients with AA at six months, being sustained in two-thirds of these after a 12-month follow-up period.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2230.2006.02256.x}}</ref> Whether this is significant remains doubtful; considerable spontaneous recovery occurs, as well.

To adapt to the disease rather than treating in an effort to cure, many options are also  available.  Wigs are often used by those with alopecia, particularly alopecia totalis, in which hair is entirely lost from the scalp.  Wigs are available at many levels of development and technology, including wigs with suction mechanisms to keep them firmly attached to the scalp. However, there is no found cure yet.

=== Research ===
A team of investigators at <ref>Columbia.edu</ref>Columbia University, department of dermatology and genetics and development, has uncovered eight genes that underpin alopecia areata, one of the most common causes of hair loss<!--, as reported in a paper in the July 1, 2010 issue of Nature-->. Since many of the genes are also implicated in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes - and treatments have already been developed that target these genes. <ref>columbia.edu</ref>According to Dr. Angela Cristiano, the lead author of the research, the genes responsible for the disease are nearly the same as those of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes and [[celiac disease]]. The discovery may soon lead to new treatments for the 5.3 million Americans suffering from hair loss caused by alopecia areata.{{nonspecific|date=May 2013}}

Among the eight genes, one stands out for its potential role in the onset of alopecia areata. The gene, called ''ULBP3'', is known to act as a homing beacon for cytotoxic cells that can invade and quickly destroy an organ. Normally, ''ULBP3'' is not present in hair follicles, but its proteins are abundant in hair follicles affected by alopecia areata. The proteins attract cells marked by a killer cell receptor, known as NKG2D. In addition to ''ULBP3'', two other genes are expressed in the hair follicle, while the five remaining genes are involved in the immune response.

Finding the initial genes underlying alopecia areata is a big step forward, but the nature of the genes is even more exciting," said Angela M. Christiano, PhD, professor of dermatology and genetics and development at <ref>Columbia.edu</ref>Columbia University,  and lead author of the study.<ref>Science daily July 1 2010</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

=== Clinical trials ===
The department of dermatology at the University of Columbia Medical Center have advised they are launching clinical trials of at least three medications:
* [[Abatacept]] (Orencia), which is FDA-approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
* A yet-to-be-named topical cream which inhibits cytokine activity, molecules that play a role in mediating the body's immune response
* [[Triamcinolone acetonide]], which although already used for the treatment of alopecia areata, has never been rigoursly tested. They will also test the immunological changes associated with the drug.<ref>Columbia university medical center newsletter</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

==Prognosis==
In most cases which begin with a small number of patches of hair loss, hair grows back after a few months to a year.<ref name=aocd/> In cases with a greater number of patches, hair can either grow back or progress to AA totalis or, in rare cases, AA universalis.<ref name=aocd/>

Effects of AA are mainly psychological (loss of self image due to hair loss). Loss of hair also means the scalp burns more easily in the sun. Loss of nasal hair increases severity of [[hay fever]] and similar allergic conditions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Patients may also have aberrant nail formation because [[keratin]] forms both hair and nails.

Hair may grow back and then fall out again later.<ref name=WebMD/> This may not indicate a recurrence of the condition, however, but rather a natural cycle of growth-and-shedding from a relatively synchronised start; such a pattern will fade over time. Episodes of AA before puberty predispose one to chronic recurrence of the condition.<ref name=merck/>

Alopecia can certainly be the cause of psychological [[stress (medicine)|stress]].  Because hair loss can lead to significant appearance changes, individuals may experience [[social anxiety|social phobia]], [[anxiety]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

==Epidemiology==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
The condition affects 0.1%–0.2% of humans{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, occurring in both males and females. Alopecia areata occurs in people who are apparently healthy and have no skin disorder.<ref name=merck>{{MerckManual|10|124|b|983|Alopecia Areata}}</ref> Initial presentation most commonly occurs in the late [[teenage]] years, early childhood, or young adulthood, but can happen with people of all ages.<ref name=draelos/> Patients also tend to have a slightly higher incidence of conditions related to the immune system: [[asthma]], allergies, atopic dermal ailments, and hypothyroidism.
