'''''Alpinia nigra''''' (synonyms  ''Alpinia allughas'' Retz. and ''Zingiber nigrum'' Gaertn.) is a medium-sized [[herb]] belonging to the [[Zingiberaceae|ginger family]]. The [[rhizome]] is well known in many [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]] as a medicinal and [[culinary herb|culinary]] item. In many Asian [[tribal]] communities it is a part of the diet along with [[rice]].

It is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[south-east Asia]] including [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. In [[India]] it is found mainly in the hillocks and riversides of northeastern states such as [[Assam]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Tripura]].

==Description==
''A. nigra'' is a [[biennial plant|biennial]] [[herbaceous plant]]. It is [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] characterized by the presence of a rhizome, simple, wide-brim leaves protected by showy [[bracts]], and terminal [[inflorescence]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Qiao C, Xu L, Wang Z.|year=2001|title= Pharmacognostical studies on the rhizome and root of ''Alpinia nigra''|journal= Zhong Yao Cai |volume=24|issue=7|pages=486–487 |pmid=11668738}}</ref> It has a soft, leafy stem about 1.5&ndash;3&nbsp;m high. Leaves are [[sessility (botany)|sessile]] or subsessile, elongated and pointed at the end. Its leaves are single [[cotyledons]], shaped to look like a pike, about 7–9&nbsp;cm wide, and about 20–40&nbsp;cm long. The fruit is a [[berry]] having many seeds, and the [[pericarp]] is thin and green when it is young, becoming black and brittle when it gets old.<ref name="Roy">{{cite journal |author= Roy B, Swargiary A, Giri BR|year=2012 |title=[http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.als.20120203.01.html# ''Alpinia Nigra'' (Family Zingiberaceae): an anthelmintic medicinal plant of north-east India]|journal= Advances in Life Sciences |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=39–51 |doi= 10.5923/j.als.20120203.01}}</ref>

==Chemical constituents==
The major chemical contents are [[alkaloids]], [[flavonoids]], [[phenols]] and [[terpenoids]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nishat FS, Nilima N, Saikia BM|year=2012 |title=[http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:mpijpri&volume=4&issue=3&article=010 Phytochemical analysis of ''Lasia spinosa'' and ''Alpinia nigra'', potential medicinal plants of Assam] |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=170–173 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.4.3.021}}</ref> The rhizome yields 0.05% essential oil; of which the chief compounds are: 23.0% caryophyllene oxide, 19.9% [[geraniol]], 19.4% eudesmool and 16.5% citronellyl OAc. Important compounds isolated from the seed cluster are kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin, I), kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide (II), heptatriacontanoic acid 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester (III), heptatriacontanoic acid 1, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester (IV) and pentatriacontanoic acid 1, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester (V).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Qiao CF, Wang Z, Dong H, Xu L, Hao X|year=2000 |title=[http://europepmc.org/abstract/CBA/343677/reload=0;jsessionid=7DlkNQDx7ZHGgcWFSMUr.0  The chemical constituents of blackfruit galangal (''Alpinia nigra'')] |journal= Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=404–405}}</ref> In addition, two major volatile oils, β-[[pinene]] and α-pinene have also been isolated from the fruits and rhizomes. From the seed clusters two bioactive flavone glycosides were isolated, astragalin and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide; and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide was found to be a dominant compound which was distributed primarily in the pulp.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Qiao CF, ''et al,''|year=2007 |title=[http://www.asianjtm.com/qikan/manage/wenzhang/AJTM07-2(3)-2.pdf  HPLC determination of two bioactive flavone glycosides and GC-MS analysis of volatile oil constituents in ''Alpinia nigra'']|journal=Asian Journal of Traditional Medicines |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=85–91}}</ref> The chemical 1,8-cineole is the major component in the leaf  essential oil (25.4%) and rhizome oil (34%). In addition, β-pinene (15.1%), [[camphor]] (15.3%), [[carotol]] (7.3%), α-pinene (7.8%) and [[camphene]] (7.0%) were also present in leaf oil, whereas in the rhizome oil α-fenchyl acetate (13.1%), α-terpineol (9.6%), β-pinene (8.1%) and camphene (7.0%) were the other main constituents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanjila PB, Kotoky R, Couladis M|year=2010 |title=[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10412905.2010.9700345 Essential oil composition of leaf and rhizome oil of ''Alpinia nigra'' (Gaertner) B.L.Burtt. from northeast India] |journal=Asian Journal of Traditional Medicines |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=358–359|doi=10.1080/10412905.2010.9700345}}</ref>

==Uses==

===Food===
The inner portion of the aerial parts (pith) is cooked as a vegetable and used in curry for flavouring. The root is used for [[seasoning]].

===Medicine===
The rhizome is used as an [[aphrodisiac]], [[Herbal tonic|tonic]], [[diuretic]], [[expectorant]], [[appetizer]] and [[analgesic]]. It is also used in the treatment of [[impotence]] and [[bronchitis]].

In most tribal communities the [[root]] pounded and mixed with rice whisky is applied to skin for [[Mycosis|fungal infections]], such as [[ringworm]] and [[melasma]]. The boiled green root is a potent [[carminative]] to reduce [[flatulence]] or [[dyspepsia]]. A root extract is taken thrice daily for the treatment of [[gastric]] [[ulcers]], and taken twice daily for the treatment of [[jaundice]] by the [[Chakma people|Chakmas]]. Its use as an [[antiinflammatory]] and analgesic agent has been supported by experiments in [[mice]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Das BN, Biswas BK |title=Anti-inflammatory activity of the rhizome extract of ''Alpinia nigra'' |journal=International Research Journal of Pharmaceuticals |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=73–76|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Das BN, Qais N |title=Analgesic activity of the rhizome extract of ''Alpinia nigra''|journal= [http://www.ijpijournals.com IJPI’s Journal of Pharmacognosy and Herbal Formulations]|volume=2 |issue=9|pages=28–32|year=2012}}</ref>

The rhizome, cooked or raw, has been traditionally acclaimed as a remedy for intestinal infections among the [[Mizo people|Mizo]] tribes of north-east India. Experimentally the crude extract was shown to be highly effective against the [[trematode]] ''[[Fasciolopsis buski]]''.<ref name="Roy" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Roy B, Dasgupta S, Tandon V. |title=[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jemt.20643/abstract Ultrastructural observations on ''Fasciolopsis buski'' and its alterations caused by shoot extract of ''Alpinia'' nigra] |journal=Microscopy Research and Technique|volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=61–66|year=2009 |doi=10.1002/jemt.20643}}</ref>
