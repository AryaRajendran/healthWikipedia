'''Cleft hand''', also known as split hand,<ref name="Barsky">Arthur J. Barsky, Cleft hand: Classification, incidence and treatment: review of the literature and report of nineteen cases, J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1964;46:1707-1720</ref> is a rare form of a congenital disorder in which the development of the hand is disturbed. It is a type I failure of formation – longitudinal arrest.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1285233-overview</ref> The central ray of the hand is affected and usually appears without proximal deficiencies of nerves, vessels, tendons, muscles and bones in contrast to the radial and ulnar deficiencies. The cleft hand appears as a V-shaped cleft situated in the centre of the hand.<ref name="Kay">Simon P. Kay and David McCombe, Central Hand Deficiencies, Congenital Disorders, pag 1404-1415</ref> The digits at the borders of the cleft might be syndactilyzed, and one or more digits can be absent. In most types, the thumb, ring finger and little finger are the less affected parts of the hand.<ref>Joseph Upton, MD, Amir H., Taghinia, MD, Correction of the Typical Cleft Hand, J Hand Surg 2010; 35A: 480-485</ref> The incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 10,000 births depending on the used classification. Cleft hand can appear unilateral or bilateral,<ref name="Kay" /> and can appear isolated or associated with a syndrome.

==History==

Literature shows that cleft hand is described centuries ago. The first reference to what might be considered a cleft hand was by Ambroise Paré in 1575. Hartsink (1770) wrote the first report of true cleft hand. In 1896, the first operation of the cleft hand is performed by Doctor Charles N. Dowed of New York City.<ref name="Barsky" /> However, the first certain description of what we know as a cleft hand as we know it today is described in the closure 19th century.<ref name="Barsky" />

===<small>Symbrachydactyly</small>===
Historically, a U-type cleft hand was also known as atypical cleft hand. The classification in which typical and atypical cleft hand are described was mostly used for clinical aspects and is shown in table 1. However, nowadays, this “atypical cleft hand” is referred to as [[symbrachydactyly]] and is not a subtype of cleft hand.

==Incidence==
===<small>Isolated cleft hand</small>===
Cleft hand can be present as an isolated difference. But the exact incidence so far is unknown.

===<small>Syndromes</small>===
Cleft hand is associated with number of syndromes, see table 2.

==Etiology==

The etiology of cleft hand is thought to be a result of a wedge-shaped defect of de apical ectoderm of the limb bud (AER: [[apical ectodermal ridge]]).<ref name="Kay" /> [[Polydactyly]], [[syndactyly]] and cleft hand can occur within the same hand, therefore some investigators suggest that these entities occur from the same machanism.<ref name="Kay" />  
This mechanism is not yet defined.

===<small>Genetics</small>===
The cause of cleft hand lies, for what is known, partly in genetics. The inheritance of cleft hand is [[autosomal dominant]] and has a [[variable penetrance]] of 70%.<ref name="Kay" />  
Cleft hand can be a spontaneous mutation during pregnancy ([[de novo mutation]]). The exact chromosomal defect in isolated cleft hand is not yet defined. However, the genetic causes of cleft hand related to syndromes have more clarity.<ref name="Katarincic" >Julia A. Katarincic, MD, Cleft Hand, Copyright © 2003 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand</ref> 
The identified mutation for SHSF syndrome (split-hand/split-foot syndrome) is 7q21-q22. A mutation in chromosome 3q27 (p63 gene) is found in families affected by SHSF syndrome and in families affected by EEC syndrome (ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome).<ref name="Katarincic" /> The p63 gene plays a critical role in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), this was found in mutant mice with dactylaplasia.<ref name="Kay"/>

===<small>Embryology</small>===
Some studies<ref name="Katarincic" /><ref>Naruse T, Takahara M, Takagi M, Ogino T, Early morphological changes leading to central polydactyly, syndactyly, and central deficiencies: an experimental study in rats, J Hand Surg Am 2007 Nov;32(9):1413-7</ref><ref>Naruse T, Takahara M, Takagi M, Oberg KC, Ogino T, Busulfan-induced central polydactyly, syndactyly and cleft hand or foot: a common mechanism of disruption leads to divergent phenotypes, Dev Growth Differ. 2007 Aug;49(6):533-41</ref> have postulated that polydactyly, syndactyly and cleft hand have the same teratogenic mechanism. In vivo tests showed that limb anomalies were found alone or in combination with cleft hand when they were given [[Myleran]]. 
These anomalies take place in humans around day 41 of [[gestation]].<ref name="Katarincic" />

==Classification==

There are several classifications for cleft hand, but the most used classification is described by Manske and Halikis<ref name="Barsky" /> see table 3. This classification is based on the first web space. The first web space is the space between the thumb and the index.

|-

|-
|IV||Merged web||Index ray suppressed, thumb web space is merged with the cleft   
|-
|V||Absent web|| Thumb elements suppressed, ulnar rays remain, thumb web space no longer present  
|}

==Treatment==

The treatment of cleft hand is usually invasive and can differ each time because of the [[heterogeneity]] of the condition. The function of a cleft hand is mostly not restricted, but yet, improving the function is one of the goals when the thumb or first webspace is absent. 

The social and stigmatising aspects of a cleft hand require more attention. A hand is a part of the body which is usually shown during communication. When this hand is obvious different and deformed, stigmatisation or rejection can occur. Sometimes, in families with cleft hand with good function, operation for cosmetic aspects are considered as marginal<ref name="Kay" />  and choose not to be operated.

===<small>Indications</small>===
Surgical treatment of the cleft hand is based on several indications<ref name="Kay" />:

Improving function
*Absent thumb
*Deforming syndactyly (mostly between digits of unequal length like index and thumb)
*Transverse bones (this will progress the deformity, growth of these bones will widen the cleft)
*Narrowed first webspace
*The feet
Esthetical aspects
*Reducing deformity

===<small>Timing of surgical interventions</small>===
The timing of surgical interventions is debatable. Parents have to decide about their child in a very vulnerable time of their parenthood. Indication for early treatment are the progressive deformity’s, such as syndactyly between index and thumb or transverse bones between the digital rays.<ref name="Kay" /> Other surgical interventions are less urgent and can wait for 1 or 2 years.

===<small>Classification and treatment</small>===
When surgery is indicated, the choice of treatment is based on the classification. Table 4 shows the treatment of cleft hand divided into the classification of Manske and Halikis. 
Techniques described by Ueba, Miura and Komada and the procedure of Snow-Littler are guidelines, since clinical and anatomical presentation within the types differ, the actual treatment is based on the individual abnormality.

{| class="wikitable" width="40%"
!Type ||Treatment
|-
|I/IIA|| Reconstruction of the transverse metacarpal ligament<ref name="Goldfarb">Manske and Goldfarb, Congenital Failure of Formation of the Upper Limb, Hand Clin. 2009 May;25(2):157-70</ref>   
|-
|IIB/III|| Transposition of the index metacarpal with reconstruction of the thumb webspace<ref name="Goldfarb" />      
|-
|IV|| Mobility and/or position of the thumb of ulnar digit to promote pinch and grasp<ref name="Barsky" />
|-
|V|| There is no cleft or web space and the thumb is very deficient. This hand requires consideration of creating a radial digit<ref name="Barsky" />
|}

===<small>Snow-Littler</small>===
The goal of this procedure is to create a wide first web space and to minimise the cleft in the hand. The index digit will be transferred to the ulnar side of the cleft. Simultaneously occurs a correction of index malrotation and deviation.<ref name="Kay" /> To minimise the cleft, it’s necessary to fixate the [[metacarpals]] together which used to border the cleft. Through repositioning flaps, the wound can be closed.

===<small>Ueba</small>===
Ueba described a less complicated surgery.<ref name="Kay" />  Transverse flaps are used to resurface the palm, the dorsal side of de transposed digit and the ulnar part of the first web space. A tendon graft is used to connect the common extensor tendons of the border digits of the cleft to prevent digital separation during extension. The closure is simpler, but has cosmetic disadvantage because of the switch between palmar and dorsal skin.

===<small>Miura and Komada</small>===
The release of the first webspace has the same principle as the Snow-Littler procedure. The difference is the closure of the first webspace, this is done by simple closure or closure with [[Z-plasties]].<ref name="Kay" />
