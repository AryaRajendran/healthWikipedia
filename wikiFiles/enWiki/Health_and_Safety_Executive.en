The '''Health and Safety Executive''' ('''HSE''') is a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[United Kingdom]] with its headquarters in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/maps/index.htm |title=HSE offices |publisher=Health & Safety Executive |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}</ref> It is the body responsible for the encouragement, regulation and enforcement of [[occupational safety and health|workplace health, safety and welfare]], and for research into occupational [[risk]]s in [[England and Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. Responsibility in [[Northern Ireland]] lies with the [[Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland]]. The HSE was created by the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], and has since absorbed earlier regulatory bodies such as the Factory Inspectorate and the [[Railway Inspectorate]] though the Railway Inspectorate was transferred to the [[Office of Rail Regulation]] in April 2006. The HSE is sponsored by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]]. As part of its work HSE investigates industrial accidents, small and large, including major incidents such as the [[explosion]] and [[fire]] at [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield]] in 2005. Though it formerly reported to the [[Health and Safety Commission]], on 1 April 2008, the two bodies merged.<ref>{{cite web |date=1 April 2008 |title=Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive merge to form a single regulatory body |author=Department for Work and Pensions |url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/apr/emp070-010408.asp |accessdate=2008-04-06 }}</ref><ref>Legislative Reform (Health and Safety Executive) Order 2008, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080960_en_1 SI 2008/960]</ref>

==Structure and responsibilities==
[[Local government in the United Kingdom|Local authorities]] are responsible for the enforcement of health and safety legislation in shops, offices, and other parts of the service sector.

Agencies belonging to the HSE include

===Explosives Inspectorate ===
HSE's Explosives Inspectorate enforces the legislation for the classification and transport of explosives. It licenses manufacturing and larger storage sites.

==={{anchor|HSL}}The Health and Safety Laboratory===
Based in [[Buxton]], Derbyshire, the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) employs over 350 people including scientists, engineers, psychologists, social scientists, health professionals and technical specialists.<ref name=HSL>[http://www.hsl.gov.uk/media/113487/annual%20report%202011.pdf HSL Annual Report and Accounts 2010/2011]</ref>  

It was established in 1921 under the Safety in Mines Research Board to carry out large-scale tests related to mining hazards.  Following the formation of the HSE, in 1975 the facilities became a [[Safety Engineering]] Laboratory and an Explosion and Flame Research Laboratory, operating as part of the Research Laboratories Service Division of the HSE. In 1995 the HSL was formed, including the Buxton site and laboratories in Sheffield.  In 2004 the Sheffield activities moved to Buxton, and the [[University of Sheffield]] took over the Sheffield laboratory site.<ref name=HSL100>[http://www.hsl.gov.uk/about-hsl/centenary.aspx www.hsl.gov.uk] A Century of Science</ref>

It now operates as an agency carrying out scientific research and investigations (e.g. on the [[Buncefield fire]]) for the HSE, other government agencies and the private sector.<ref name=HSL/>

===HM Inspectorate of Mines===
HM Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for the correct implementation and inspection of safe working procedures within all UK mine workings. It is based in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]].<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/mining/index.htm www.hse.gov.uk/mining/]</ref>

===Nuclear Directorate===
The Nuclear Directorate was one of the bodies merged into the [[Office for Nuclear Regulation]] on 1 April 2011. Largely based in [[Bootle]], the Nuclear Directorate had four main functions:
* nuclear safety and radioactive waste management of civilian and defence sites - Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
* security of civilian nuclear sites and nuclear transport - The Office for Nuclear Security (transferred to HSE April 2007)
* safeguarding civilian nuclear material to prevent diversion to weapons - UK Safeguards Office (transferred to HSE April 2007)
* a nuclear safety research programme

===OSHCR (Occupational Safety & Health Consultants Register)===
The HSE currently administrates the Occupational Safety & Health Consultants Register ([[OSHCR]]), a central register of registered safety consultants within the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  The intention of the HSE is to pass responsibility of operating the register to the relevant trade & professional bodies once the register is up and running.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/oshcr/business-qa.htm About OSHCR on the HSE website]</ref>

==Criticism==

The HSE has been criticised. Some of the criticism has been that its procedures are inadequate to protect safety. For example, the public enquiry by Lord Gill into the [[Stockline Plastics factory explosion]] criticised the HSE for "inadequate appreciation of the risks associated with buried LPG pipework ... and a failure properly to carry out check visits".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/hse-response-to-stockline-too-little-too-late-1.826334|title=HSE response to Stockline 'too little, too late'|publisher=Daily Herald|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> However, most criticism of the HSE is that their regulations are over-broad, suffocating, and part of a [[nanny state]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-446245/Dont-touch-office-chair-Health-Safety-demand-48-hours-notice-it.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Arthur | last=Martin | title=Don't touch that office chair! Health and Safety demand 48 hours notice to move it | date=2 April 2007}}</ref> [[The Daily Telegraph]], a right-wing broadsheet, has also been claimed that the HSE is part of a "compensation culture," that it is undemocratic and unaccountable,<ref>http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2009/12/david-cameron-declares-war-on-the-nonsense-of-the-overthetop-health-and-safety-culture.html</ref> that its rules are costing jobs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7966428/Health-and-safety-laws-are-costing-jobs.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Deputy | last=Political | title=Health and safety laws are costing jobs | date=27 August 2010}}</ref>

However, the HSE denies this,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/30/judith-hackitt-health-safety-work | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jane | last=Dudman | title=Dispelling the myths around health and safety | date=30 June 2010}}</ref> saying that much of the criticism is misplaced because it relates to matters outside the HSE's remit. The HSE also responded to criticism by publishing a "Myth of the Month" section on its website between 2007 and 2010, which it described as "exposing the various myths about ‘health and safety’".<ref>http://www.hse.gov.uk/myth/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2007/gnnwm09907.htm|title=HSE and local authorities hit back at ‘health and Safety’ myths |publisher=HSE |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> This has become a political issue in the UK. The Lord Young report, published in October 2010, recommended various reforms aiming "to free businesses from unnecessary bureaucratic burdens and the fear of having to pay out unjustified damages claims and legal fees."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/402906_CommonSense_acc.pdf|title=Common Sense Common Safety: A report by Lord Young of Graffham to the Prime Minister|publisher=HM Government|page=9}}</ref>
