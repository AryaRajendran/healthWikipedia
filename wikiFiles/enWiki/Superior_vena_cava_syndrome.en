'''Superior vena cava syndrome''' ('''SVCS'''), or '''superior vena cava obstruction''' ('''SVCO'''), is usually the result of the direct obstruction of the [[superior vena cava]] by malignancies such as compression of the vessel wall by right upper lobe [[tumors]] or [[thymoma]] and/or [[mediastinal lymphadenopathy]]. The most common malignancy that causes SVCS is [[bronchogenic carcinoma]]. Cerebral edema is rare, but if it occurs it may be fatal. <ref name=oherm>{{cite book | last = Parker | first = Robert | coauthors = Catherine Thomas, Lesley Bennett | title = Emergencies in Respiratory Medicine | publisher = Oxford | year = 2007 | pages = 96–7 | isbn = 978-0-19-920244-7 }}</ref><ref name=ohcm>{{cite book | last = Longmore | first = Murray | coauthors = Ian Wilkinson, Tom Turmezei, Chee Kay Cheung | title = Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine | publisher = Oxford | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-19-856837-1 | page = 162 }}</ref> 
 
==Signs and symptoms==
[[Shortness of breath]] is the most common symptom, followed by face or arm swelling.<ref name=emedicine>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/760301-overview emedicine > Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.] Author: Michael S Beeson, MD, MBA, FACEP, Professor of Emergency Medicine, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine and Pharmacy; Attending Faculty, Summa Health System.

Superior vena cava syndrome usually presents more gradually with an increase in symptoms over time as malignancies increase in size or invasiveness.<ref name=emedicine>{{EMedicine|emerg|561|Superior Vena Cava Syndrome}}</ref>

==Cause==
[[File:SVCsyndrome.png|thumb|Thrombosis of the superior vena cava caused by an indwelling central venous catheter which caused superior vena cava syndrome]]
Approximately 90% of cases are associated with a cancerous tumor that is compressing the superior vena cava,<ref name=emedicine/> such as [[bronchogenic carcinoma]] including small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma, [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], lymphoblastic lymphomas, pre-[[T-cell]] lineage [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (rare), and other acute leukemias.<ref name=emedicine/> [[Syphilis]] and [[tuberculosis]] have also been known to cause superior vena cava syndrome.<ref name=emedicine/> SVCS can be caused by invasion or compression by a pathological process or by thrombosis in the vein itself, although this latter is less common (approximately 35% due to the use of intravascular devices).<ref name=emedicine/>

==Diagnosis==

[[File:SVCCT.PNG|thumb|A CT image showing compression of the right hilar structures by cancer.]]
The main techniques of diagnosing SVCS are with chest [[X-rays]] (CXR), [[Computed Tomography|CT scans]], transbronchial needle [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]] at [[bronchoscopy]] and [[mediastinoscopy]].<ref name=oherm>{{cite book | last = Parker | first = Robert | coauthors = Catherine Thomas, Lesley Bennett | title = Emergencies in Respiratory Medicine | publisher = Oxford | year = 2007 | pages = 96–7 | isbn = 978-0-19-920244-7 }}</ref> CXRs provide the ability to show mediastinal widening and may show the presenting primary cause of SVCS.<ref name=oherm/> CT scans should be contrast enhanced and be taken on the neck, chest, lower abdomen and pelvis.<ref name=oherm/> They may also show the underlying cause and the extent to which the disease has progressed.<ref name=oherm/>

==Treatment==
Several methods of treatment are available, mainly consisting of careful drug therapy and surgery.<ref name=emedicine/> [[Glucocorticoids]] (such as [[prednisone]] or [[methylprednisolone]]) decrease the inflammatory response to tumor invasion and edema surrounding the tumor.<ref name=emedicine/> Glucocorticoids are most helpful if the tumor is steroid-responsive, such as lymphomas.  In addition, [[diuretics]] (such as [[furosemide]]) are used to reduce venous return to the heart which relieves the increased pressure.<ref name=emedicine/>

In an acute setting, endovascular stenting by an interventional radiologist may provide relief of symptoms in as little as 12-24 hours with minimal risks.

==Prognosis==
Symptoms are usually relieved with [[radiation therapy]] within one month of treatment.<ref name=emedicine/> However, even with treatment, 90% of patients die within two and a half years.<ref name=emedicine/> This relates to the cancerous causes of SVC that are 90% of the cases. The average age of onset of disease is 54 years of age.<ref name=emedicine/>
