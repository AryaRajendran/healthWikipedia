The '''autism spectrum''' or '''autistic spectrum''' describes a range of conditions classified as [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM). Pervasive developmental disorders include [[autism]], [[Asperger syndrome]], [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS), [[childhood disintegrative disorder]], and [[Rett syndrome]], although usually only the first three conditions are considered part of the autism spectrum.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=C. P.|coauthors=Myers, S. M.|title=Identification and Evaluation of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal=Pediatrics|date=1 November 2007|volume=120|issue=5|pages=1183–1215|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361|pmid=17967920|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/1183.full}}</ref>  These disorders are typically characterized by social deficits, communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviors and interests, and in some cases, cognitive delays.

{{further2|[[Autism#Classification|Autism classification]]}}

Autism forms the core of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes;<ref name=Lord/> unlike autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no significant delay in [[language development]].<ref>{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |editionphrase=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |date=2000 |isbn=0890420254 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |publisher=<!-- citation bot fodder --> |location=<!-- citation bot fodder --> }}</ref> PDD-NOS is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.

The terminology of autism can be bewildering. Autism, Asperger syndrome, and PDD-NOS are sometimes called the ''autistic disorders'' instead of ASD,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Freitag CM |title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 }}</ref> whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.<ref name=Piven/> Although the older term ''pervasive developmental disorder'' and the newer term ''autism spectrum disorder'' largely or entirely overlap,<ref name=NIMH-ASD-PDD/> the former was intended to describe a specific set of diagnostic labels, whereas the latter refers to a postulated [[spectrum disorder]] linking various conditions.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Rev Bras Psiquiatr |year=2006 |volume=28 |issue=suppl 1 |pages=S3–S11 |title=Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview |author=Klin A |doi=10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 |pmid=16791390 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462006000500002&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en }}</ref> ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [[phenotype]] (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [[Trait (biology)|traits]], such as avoiding eye contact.<ref name=Piven>{{vcite journal |author=Piven J, Palmer P, Jacobi D, Childress D, Arndt S |title=Broader autism phenotype: evidence from a family history study of multiple-incidence autism families |journal=Am J Psychiatry |date=1997 |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=185–90 |pmid=9016266 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/2/185.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref>

A revision to autism spectrum disorder is proposed in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' version 5 ([[DSM-5]]), which will be released in May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org |title=Home &#124; APA DSM-5 |publisher=Dsm5.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> The new diagnosis will encompass current diagnoses of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and PDD-NOS. Rather than categorizing these diagnoses, the DSM-5 will adopt a dimensional approach to diagnosing disorders that fall underneath the autism spectrum umbrella. It is thought that individuals with ASDs are best represented as a single diagnostic category because they demonstrate similar types of symptoms and are better differentiated by clinical specifiers (i.e., dimensions of severity) and associated features (i.e., known genetic disorders, epilepsy and intellectual disability). An additional change to the DSM includes collapsing social and communication deficits into one domain. Thus, an individual with an ASD diagnosis will be described in terms of severity of social communication symptoms, severity of fixated or restricted behaviors or interests and associated features.

== Characteristics ==
[[Autism]] is characterized by delays or abnormal functioning before the age of three years in one or more of the following domains: (1) social interaction; (2) communication; and (3) restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities.<ref name=DSM-IV-TR>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.)|year= 2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

[[Asperger syndrome]] can be distinguished from autism by the lack of delay or deviance in early language development.<ref name=DSM-IV-TR /> Additionally, individuals with Asperger syndrome do not have significant cognitive delays. Other symptoms include repetitive routines or rituals, peculiarities in speech and language, inappropriate affect or social behavior, problems with non-verbal communication, and clumsy or uncoordinated motor movements.<ref>{{cite web|title=NINDS Asperger Syndrome Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/asperger.htm|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke}}</ref>

[[PDD-NOS]] is considered "subthreshold autism" and "atypical autism" because it is often characterized by milder symptoms of autism or symptoms in only one domain (such as social difficulties).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mesibov|first=G.B.|title=Ask the Editor: What is PDD-NOS and how is it diagnosed?|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Diso|year=1997|volume=27|issue=4}}</ref> People with PDD-NOS may demonstrate pervasive deficits in the development of reciprocal social interaction or stereotyped behaviors, but do not meet the criteria for a specific pervasive developmental disorder or other psychological disorders (such as schizophrenia or avoidant personality disorder).<ref name=DSM-IV-TR />

=== Developmental course ===

Although autism spectrum disorders are thought to follow two possible developmental courses, most parents report that symptom onset occurred within the first year of life.{{MEDRS|date=December 2012}}<ref> {{MEDRS|date=December 2012}} {{cite journal|last=Lord|first=C|title=Follow-up of two-year-olds referred for possible autism|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|year=1995|volume=36|pages=1365–1382|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb01669.x|pmid=8988272|issue=8}}</ref> One course of development follows a gradual course of onset in which parents report concerns in development over the first two years of life and diagnosis is made around 3–4 years of age. Some of the early signs of ASDs in this course include decreased looking at faces, failure to turn when name is called, failure to show interests by showing or pointing, and delayed pretend play.{{MEDRS|date=December 2012}}<ref name="Werner et al."> {{MEDRS|date=December 2012}} {{cite journal|last=Werner|coauthors=Dawson, Munson, & Osterling|title=Variation in early developmental course in autism and its relation with behavioral outcome at 3-4 years of age|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=2005|volume=35|issue=3|pages=337–350|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3301-6|pmid=16119475|first1=E}}</ref> A second course of development is characterized by normal or near-normal development followed by loss of skills or regression in the first 2–3 years. Regression may occur in a variety of domains, including communication, social, cognitive, and self-help skills; however, the most common regression is loss of language.{{MEDRS|date=December 2012}}<ref name="Werner et al." /> There continues to be a debate over the differential outcomes based on these two developmental courses. Some studies suggest that regression is associated with poorer outcomes and others report no differences between those with early gradual onset and those who experience a regression period.<ref name="Mash & Barkley" /> Overall, the prognosis for people with autism is poor with respect to academic achievement and independent living abilities, particularly for those who have not received early intervention.<ref name="Mash & Barkley" /> However, many individuals show improvements as they grow older. The two best predictors of favorable outcome in autism are the absence of intellectual disability  and the development of some communicative speech prior to five years of age.{{MEDRS|date=December 2012}}<ref name=Mawhood> {{MEDRS|date=December 2012}} {{cite journal|last=Mawhood|coauthors=Howlin, & Rutter|title=Autism and developmental receptive language disorder: A comparative follow-up in early adult life.

== Causes ==

{{Main|Causes of autism}}

While a specific cause or specific causes of autism spectrum disorders has yet to be found, many risk factors have been identified in the research literature that may contribute to the development of an ASD. These risk factors include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors, neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors.<br />
It is possible to identify general risk factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific factors. In the current state of knowledge, prediction can only be of a global nature and therefore requires the use of general markers.{{MEDRS|date=December 2012}}<ref> {{MEDRS|date=December 2012}} {{cite web|title=In Search of Prediction Factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders:An Impossible Task?|url=http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=24924}}</ref>

=== Genetic risk factors ===

The results of family and twin studies suggest that genetic factors play a role in the etiology of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders.<ref name="Rutter 2000">{{cite journal|last=Rutter|title=Genetic studies of autism: From the 1970s into the millenium|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2000|volume=28|pages=3–14|doi=10.1023/A:1005113900068|pmid=10772346|first1=M|issue=1}}</ref> Studies have consistently found that the prevalence of autism in siblings of autistic children is approximately 15 to 30 times greater than the rate in the general population.<ref name="Szatmari 1999">{{cite journal|last=Szatmari|first=P|title=Heterogeneity and the genetics of autism|journal=Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience|year=1999|volume=24|pages=159–165|pmid=10212560|issue=2|pmc=1188998}}</ref> In addition, research suggests that there is a much higher concordance rate among monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins.<ref name="Rutter 1990">{{cite journal|last=Rutter|coauthors=Macdonald, Le Couteur, Harrington, Bolton, & Bailey|title=Genetic factors in child psychiatric disorders: II.

=== Prenatal and perinatal risk factors ===

A number of prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism. These risk factors include maternal gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal age over 30, bleeding after first trimester, use of prescription medication during pregnancy, and [[meconium]] in the amniotic fluid. While research is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to autism, each of these factors has been identified more frequently in autistic children compared to their non-autistic siblings and other normally developing youth.<ref name="Garder, Spiegelman, Buka">{{cite journal|last=Gardner|coauthors=Spiegelman, & Buka|title=Perinatal and Neonatal Risk Factors for Autism: A Comprehensive Meta-analysis|journal=Pediatrics|year=2011|volume=128|pages=344–355|doi=10.1542/peds.2010-1036|pmid=21746727|first1=H|issue=2}}</ref>

=== Vaccine controversy ===

Probably the most damaging recent claim regarding autism etiology is the "[[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccine controversy]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=DK|title=The vaccine-autism connection: a public health crisis caused by unethical medical practices and fraudulent science.|journal=The Annals of pharmacotherapy|year=2011|volume=45|issue=10|pages=1302–4|pmid=21917556|doi=10.1345/aph.1Q318}}</ref>  This conjecture, arising from a case of scientific misconduct,<ref name=Godlee2011>{{cite journal|last=Godlee|first=F|coauthors=Smith, J; Marcovitch, H|title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|year=2011|volume=342|pages=c7452|doi=10.1136/bmj.c7452|pmid=21209060|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full}}</ref> suggested that autism results from brain damage caused either by (1) the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine itself, or by (2) thimerosal, a vaccine preservative that is 50% ethylmercury.<ref name="Tan and Parkin 2008">{{cite journal|last=Tan|coauthors=Parkin|title=Route of decomposition of thimerosal|journal=International Journal of Pharmacy|year=2008|volume=24|pages=13299– 13305}}</ref> The medical consensus is that no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims, based on various lines of evidence including the observation that the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from routine childhood vaccines.<ref name="Waterhouse 2008">{{cite journal|last=Waterhous|title=Autism overflows: Increasing prevalence and proliferating theories|journal=Neuropsychological Review|year=2008|volume=18|pages=273–286|doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9074-x|first1=Lynn|issue=4}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
{{main|Autism#Mechanism}}
In general, neuroanatomical studies support the notion that autism is linked to a combination of brain enlargement in some areas and brain reduction in other areas.<ref name="Koenig et al.">{{cite book|last=Koenig, Tsatsanis, & Volkmar|title=The development of autism: Perspectives from theory and research|year=2001|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=81–101}}</ref> These studies suggest that autism may be caused by abnormal neuronal growth and pruning during the early stages of prenatal and postnatal brain development, leaving some areas of the brain with too many neurons and other areas with too few neurons.<ref name="Minshew 1996">{{cite journal|last=Minshew|title=Brief report: Brain mechanisms in autism: Functional and structural abnormalities|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1996|volume=26|pages=205–209|doi=10.1007/BF02172013|pmid=8744486|first1=NJ|issue=2}}</ref> Some research has reported an overall brain enlargement in autism while others suggest abnormalities in several areas of the brain, including the frontal lobe, the mirror neuron system, the limbic system, the temporal lobe, and the [[corpus callosum]].

In neuroanatomical studies, it has been shown that for autistics there is reduced activation in the primary and secondary somato-sensory cortices during [[Theory of Mind]] and facial emotion response tasks when compared to control. This is consistent with reports of patterns of abnormal cortical thickness and grey matter volume in those regions in autistics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sugranyes|first=Gisela|title=Autism Spectrum Disorders and Schizophrenia: Meta Analysis of the Neural Correlate of Social Cognition|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2011|volume=6.10|issue=E25322}}</ref>

=== Mirror neuron system ===
{{main|Mirror neuron}}

The [[mirror neuron]] system (MNS) consists of a network of brain areas that have been associated with empathy processes in humans.<ref name="Fadiga et al">{{cite journal|last=Fadiga|first=L.|coauthors=Craighero, L. & Olivier, E.|title=Human motor cortex excitability during the perception of others' action|journal=Curr Opin Neurobiol|year=2005|volume=15|pages=213–218|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.03.013|pmid=15831405|issue=2}}</ref> In humans, the MNS has been identified in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and is thought to be activated during imitation or observation of behaviors.<ref name=Shamy-Tsoory>{{cite journal|last=Shamay-Tsoory|first=S.G.|title=The Neural Bases for Empathy|journal=The Neuroscientist|year=2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=18–24|doi=10.1177/1073858410379268|pmid=21071616}}</ref>

=== Temporal lobe ===
Functions of the [[temporal lobe]] are related to many of the deficits observed in individuals with ASDs, such as receptive language, social cognition, [[joint attention]], action observation, and empathy. The temporal lobe also contains the [[superior temporal sulcus]] (STS) and the [[fusiform gyrus|fusiform face area]] (FFA), which may mediate facial processing. It has been argued that dysfunction in the STS underlies the social deficits that characterize autism. Compared to typically developing individuals, one fMRI study found that individuals with high functioning autism had reduced activity in the FFA when viewing pictures of faces.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=R.|title=Developmental deficits in social perception in autism: The role of amygdala and fusiform face area|journal=International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=23|pages=125–141|doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.12.012|pmid=15749240|issue=2–3}}</ref>

=== Mitochondrial dysfunction ===

It has been noted that children with ASD are afflicted with undiagnosed [[comorbid]] conditions such as abnormalities in the peripheral nervous, immune, gastrointestinal and energy production systems, suggesting that ASD isn't strictly a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) disorder, but rather a systemic one.<ref name=Ming>{{cite journal |journal=J Child Neurol |year=2008 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=6-13 |title= Autism spectrum disorders: concurrent clinical disorders |author= Xue Ming, Brimacombe M, Chaaban J, Zimmerman-Bier B, Wagner GC |pmid=18056691 |doi=10.1177/0883073807307102}}</ref> It has been hypothesized that ASD could be linked to a mitochondrial disorder, as it is a basic cellular abnormality that has the potential to cause disturbances in a wide range of body systems.<ref name=Haas>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=1326-1333 |title= Mitochondrial disease: a practical approach for primary care physicians |author= Haas RH, Parikh S, Falk MJ, Saneto RP, Wolf NI, Darin N, Cohen BH |pmid=18055683 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-0391}}</ref> A recent [[meta-analysis]] study, as well as other population studies have shown that approximately 5% of children with ASD meet the criteria for classical [[mitochondrial disease]] (MD),<ref name=Rossignol>{{cite journal |journal=Mol Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=290-314 |title= Mitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis |author= Rossignol DA, Frye RE |pmid=21263444|doi=10.1038/mp.2010.136}}</ref> and that around 7.2 to 80 percent of children with ASD present with some variant of mitochondrial dysfunction.<ref name=Oliveira>{{cite journal |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2005 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=185-189 |title= Mitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders: a population-based study |author= Oliveira G, Diogo L, Grazina M, Garcia P, Ataíde A, Marques C, Miguel T, Borges L, Vicente AM, Oliveira CR |pmid=15739723}}</ref> It is currently unclear why the mitochondrial dysfunction occurs considering that only 23% of children with both ASD and MD present with mitochondrial DNA ([[mtDNA]]) abnormalities.<ref name="Rossignol" />

== Diagnosis ==
=== Evidence-based assessment ===

Furthermore, it has been suggested that assessments of children with suspected ASD be evaluated within a developmental framework, include multiple informants (e.g., parents and teachers) from diverse contexts (e.g., home and school), and employ a multidisciplinary team of professionals (e.g., clinical psychologists, neuropsychologists, and psychiatrists).<ref name="Ozonoff 2005" />

After a child fails an initial screening, psychologists administer various psychological assessment tools to assess for ASD.<ref name="Ozonoff 2005">{{cite journal|last=Ozonoff|first=S.|coauthors=Goodlin-Jones, B.L. & Solomon, M.|title=Evidence-Based Assessment of Autism|journal=Journal of Clinical and Child Adolescent Psychology|year=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=523–540|doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp3403_8}}</ref> Amongst these measurements, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) are considered the "gold standards" for assessing autistic children. The ADI-R is a semi-structured parent interview that probes for symptoms of autism by evaluating a child's current behavior and developmental history. The ADOS is a semistructured interactive evaluation of ASD symptoms that is used to measure social and communication abilities by eliciting a number of opportunities (or "presses") for spontaneous behaviors (e.g., eye contact) in standardized context. Various other questionnaires (e.g., The Childhood Autism Rating Scale) and tests of cognitive functioning (e.g., The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) are typically included in an ASD assessment battery.

=== Comorbidity ===
{{main|Comorbidy in autism spectrum disorders}}

Autism spectrum disorders tend to be highly comorbid with other disorders. [[Comorbidity]] may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with ASDs and make intervention/treatment more difficult.  Distinguishing between ASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often overlap with symptoms of other disorders and the characteristics of ASDs make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult.<ref name="Helverschou et al.">{{cite book|last=Matson & Sturmey|title=International Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders|year=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=53–74}}</ref><ref>Underwood, L., McCarthy, J. & Tsakanikos, E.

The most common medical condition occurring in individuals with autism spectrum disorders is seizure disorder or [[epilepsy]], which occurs in 11-39% of individuals with ASD.<ref name="Ballaban-Gill & Tuchman">{{cite journal|last=Ballaban-Gil|coauthors=Tuchman|title=Epilepsy and epileptiform EEG: Association with autism and language disorders|journal=Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|year=2000|volume=6|issue=4|pages=300–308|doi=10.1002/1098-2779(2000)6:4<300::AID-MRDD9>3.0.CO;2-R|pmid=11107195|first1=K}}</ref> [[Tuberous sclerosis]], a medical condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the brain and on other vital organs, occurs in 1-4% of individuals with ASDs.<ref name=Wiznitzer>{{cite journal|last=Wiznitzer|first=M|title=Autism and tuberous sclerosis|journal=Journal of Child Neurology|year=2004|volume=19|issue=9|pages=675–679|pmid=15563013}}</ref>

Intellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs.

== Management ==

{{Main|Autism therapies}}

The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills. Available approaches include [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA), developmental models, [[TEACCH|structured teaching]], [[speech and language therapy]], [[social skills]] therapy, and [[occupational therapy]].<ref name=Myers>{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author=Myers SM, Johnson CP, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29 }}</ref> There has been increasing attention to the development of evidenced-based interventions for young children with ASDs. Unresearched alternative therapies have also been implemented (for example, vitamin therapy and acupuncture). Although evidenced-based interventions for autistic children vary in their methods, many adopt a psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive, communication and social skills while minimizing problem behaviors. It has been argued that no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs.<ref name=Myers/>

One of the most empirically supported intervention approaches is [[applied behavioral analysis]], particularly in regard to early intensive home-based therapy. Although ABA therapy has a strong research base, other studies have found that this approach may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rogers SJ, Vismara LA |title=Evidence-based comprehensive treatments for early autism |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=8–38 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18444052 |pmc=2943764 |doi=10.1080/15374410701817808 |url=}}</ref>

Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI), through the use of Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), has been researched for over 40 years in its effectiveness. Most EIBI programs recognize that all skills appropriate for each specific age are teachable and should be taught. General curriculum areas that are addressed are language, social skills, play skills, motor skills, pre-academic and academic skills, and independent living skills. ABA models of intervention for preschool age include two main approaches to teaching. "Discrete Trial Teaching" or DTT, includes multiple discrete opportunities that are presented across the day or session. A discrete trial consists of the therapist presenting an instruction, the child responding, and the therapist responding to that by presenting a consequence. If the child responds incorrectly, the reinforcer is not given and the therapist will follow up with an error correction procedure, followed by another trial. A strength of this way of teaching is the child receives a large number of trials in a short time, allowing for a large amount of learning opportunities. A potential weakness may be that the skills learned in this structured setting are not easily generalized in less strict settings. "Natural Environment Teaching" consists of maximizing naturally occurring learning opportunities. It involves a more child-directed format that allows for the child to initiate learning, and the therapist to recognize this and follow it by prompting the child for a desired behavior before giving the reinforcer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Granpeesheh, PhD, BCBA|first=Doreen|title=Applied behavior analytic interventions for children with autism: A description and review of treatment research|url=http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=7939|work=The Journal of Family Practice|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==

{{Main|Epidemiology of autism}}
Reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 6 per 1,000 for autism spectrum disorders as a whole,<ref name="Newschaffer">{{cite journal|last=Newschaffer|first=C|title=The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2007|volume=28|pages=1–24|author-separator=,|author2=Croen|author3=Daniels|author4=Giarelli|display-authors=3}}</ref> however prevalence rates vary for each of the developmental disorders in the spectrum. Autism prevalence has been estimated at 1-2 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000, and PDD-NOS at 3.7 per 1,000.<ref name="Newschaffer"/> These rates are consistent across cultures and ethnic groups, as autism is considered a universal disorder.<ref name="Mash & Barkley" />

While rates of autism spectrum disorders are consistent across cultures, they vary greatly by gender, with boys being affected far more frequently than girls. The average male-to-female ratio for ASDs is 4.2:1,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fombonne|first=E|title=Epidemiology of Pervasive Developmental Disorders|journal=Pediatric Research|year=2009|volume=65|issue=6|pages=591–598|doi=10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7203|pmid=19218885}}</ref> affecting 1 in 70 males, but only 1 in 315 females.<ref>{{cite journal|last=(ADDM) Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2006 Principal Investigators|title=Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders-Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network|journal=MMWR Surveillance Summary|year=2009|volume=58|pages=1–20}}</ref> Females, however, are more likely to have associated cognitive impairment.

accounted by gender differences in the expression of clinical symptoms, with females showing less atypical behaviors and, therefore, less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis.<ref>Tsakanikos, E., Underwood, L., Kravariti, E., Bouras, N., & McCarthy, J.

== History ==
{{further2|[[Autism#History|Autism history]]}}

Controversies have surrounded various claims regarding the etiology of autism spectrum disorders. In the 1950s, the "[[refrigerator mother theory]]" emerged as an explanation for autism. The hypothesis was based on the idea that autistic behaviors stem from the emotional frigidity, lack of warmth, and cold, distant, rejecting demeanor of a child's mother.<ref name="Kanner 1949">{{cite journal|last=Kanner|first=L|title=Problems of nosology and psychodynamics in early childhood autism|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|year=1949|volume=19|pages=416–426|pmid=18146742|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x}}</ref> Naturally, parents of children with an autism spectrum disorder suffered from blame, guilt, and self-doubt, especially as the theory was embraced by the medical establishment and went largely unchallenged into the mid-1960s. While the "refrigerator mother theory" has been rejected in the research literature, its effects have lingered into the 21st century. Another controversial claim suggests that watching extensive amounts of television may cause autism. This hypothesis was largely based on research suggesting that the increasing rates of autism in the 1970s and 1980s were linked to the growth of cable television at this time.<ref name="Waterhouse 2008">{{cite journal|last=Waterhouse|title=Autism overflows: Increasing prevalence and proliferating theories|journal=Neuropsychological Review|year=2008|volume=18|pages=273–286|doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9074-x|first1=Lynn|issue=4}}</ref> This conjecture has not been supported in the research literature.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
