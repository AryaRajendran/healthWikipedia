'''Anxiety disorder''' is an umbrella term that covers several different forms of a type of common psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]], [[worrying]], uneasiness, [[apprehension]] and [[fear]] about future uncertainties either based on real or imagined events, which may affect both physical and psychological health. There are numerous psychiatric and medical syndromes which may [[differential diagnosis|mimic the symptoms]] of an anxiety disorder such as [[hyperthyroidism]] which may be [[Misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] as [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. 

Individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder may be classified in one of two categories; based on whether they experience continuous or episodic symptoms.  

Current psychiatric diagnostic criteria recognize a wide variety of anxiety disorders. Recent surveys have found that as many as 18% of Americans and 14% of Europeans may be affected by one or more of them.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Merikangas KR, Walters EE |title=Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of 12-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Arch. Gen.

The term [[anxiety]] covers four aspects of experiences an individual may have: mental apprehension, physical tension, physical symptoms and dissociative anxiety.<ref>David Healy, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ikTJViYMPIEC&lpg=PP1&dq=Psychiatric%20drugs%2C%20Healey&pg=PA135#v=onepage&q&f=false Psychiatric Drugs Explained, Section 5: Management of Anxiety]'', Elsevier Health Sciences, 2008, pp. 136–137</ref> Anxiety disorder is divided into [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[phobic disorder]], and [[panic disorder]]; each has its own characteristics and symptoms and they require different treatment (Gelder ''et al.'' 2005). The emotions present in anxiety disorders range from simple nervousness to bouts of terror (Barker 2003).

Standardized screening clinical questionnaires such as the [[Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale]] or the [[Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale]] can be used to detect anxiety [[symptom]]s, and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment of anxiety disorder.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5172928 | volume=12 | issue=6 | title=A rating instrument for anxiety disorders | year=1971 | author=Zung WW | pages=371–379 | journal = Psychosomatics | doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(71)71479-0}}</ref>

==Classification==

===Generalized anxiety disorder===
{{Main|Generalized anxiety disorder}}
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common, chronic disorder characterized by long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any one object or situation. Those suffering from generalized anxiety disorder experience non-specific persistent fear and worry, and become overly concerned with everyday matters. According to Schacter, Gilbert, and Wegner's book ''Psychology: Second Edition'', generalized anxiety disorder is "characterized by chronic excessive worry accompanied by three or more of the following symptoms: restlessness, fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance".<ref>Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D.M. (2011). ''Psychology: Second Edition''. New York, NY: Worth.</ref> Generalized anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder to affect older adults.<ref name="Calleo"/> Anxiety can be a symptom of a medical or substance abuse problem, and medical professionals must be aware of this. A diagnosis of GAD is made when a person has been excessively worried about an everyday problem for six months or more.<ref name="Barker2003">{{cite book|author=Phil Barker|title=Psychiatric and mental health nursing: the craft of caring|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6qdoQgAACAAJ|accessdate=17 December 2010|date=7 October 2003|publisher=Arnold|location=London| isbn = 978-0-340-81026-2 }}</ref> A person may find they have problems making daily decisions and remembering commitments as a result of lack of concentration/preoccupation with worry.<ref>''Psychology'', Michael Passer, Ronald Smith, Nigel Holt, Andy Bremner, Ed Sutherland, Michael Vliek (2009) McGrath Hill Education, UK: McGrath Hill Companies Inc. p 790</ref> Appearance looks strained, with increased sweating from the hands, feet, and axillae.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} May be tearful which can suggest depression.<ref>''Psychiatry'', Michael Gelder, Richard Mayou, John Geddes 3rd ed.

E (2010). ''Manual of Psychiatric Nursing Care Planning: Assessment Guides, Diagnoses and Psychopharmacology''. 4th ed. New York: Saunders Elsevier. p 109.</ref>

===Phobias===
{{Main|Phobia}}
The single largest category of anxiety disorders is that of [[phobic disorders]], which includes all cases in which fear and anxiety is triggered by a specific stimulus or situation. Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide suffer from phobic disorders.<ref name="Barker2003"/> Sufferers typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Sufferers understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger but still are overwhelmed by the fear.<ref>''Psychology''. Michael Passer, Ronald Smith, Nigel Holt, Andy Bremner, Ed Sutherland, Michael Vliek. (2009) McGrath Hill Higher Education; UK: McGrath Hill companies Inc.</ref>

===Panic disorder===
{{Main|Panic disorder}}
With panic disorder, a person suffers from brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension, often marked by trembling, shaking, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and/or difficulty [[breath]]ing. These [[panic attacks]], defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]] as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes, can last for several hours. Attacks can be triggered by stress, fear, or even exercise; the specific cause is not always apparent.

In addition to recurrent unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. Accordingly, those suffering from panic disorder experience symptoms even outside specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed by a panic sufferer, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness ([[hypervigilance]]) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme [[hypochondriasis]]).

====Agoraphobia====
{{Main|Agoraphobia}}
Agoraphobia is the specific anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable.<ref>{{harvnb|Craske|2000}} Gorman, 2000</ref> Agoraphobia is strongly linked with [[panic disorder]] and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term [[agoraphobia]] is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that sufferers often develop. For example, following a panic attack while driving, someone suffering from agoraphobia may develop anxiety over driving and will therefore avoid driving. These avoidance behaviors can often have serious consequences.

====Social anxiety disorder====
{{Main|Social anxiety disorder}}
[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD; also known as social phobia) describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This [[fear]] can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or, more typically, is experienced in most (or all) social interactions. [[Social anxiety]] often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those suffering from [[social anxiety]] often will attempt to avoid the source of their [[anxiety]]; in the case of [[social anxiety]] this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases can lead to complete social isolation.

===Obsessive–compulsive disorder===
{{Main|Obsessive–compulsive disorder}}
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder primarily characterized by repetitive [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]s (distressing, persistent, and intrusive thoughts or images) and [[compulsive behavior|compulsions]] (urges to perform specific acts or rituals). It affects roughly around 3% of the population worldwide.<ref name="Barker2003"/> The OCD thought pattern may be likened to superstitions insofar as it involves a belief in a causative relationship where, in reality, one does not exist. Often the process is entirely illogical; for example, the compulsion of walking in a certain pattern may be employed to alleviate the obsession of impending harm. And in many cases, the compulsion is entirely inexplicable, simply an urge to complete a [[ritual]] triggered by nervousness.

In a slight minority of cases, sufferers of OCD may only experience obsessions, with no overt compulsions; a much smaller number of sufferers experience only compulsions.<ref name="psycho-prat">[http://www.psycho-prat.fr/index.php?module=webuploads&func=download&fileId=2963_0 Psychological Disorders], Psychologie Anglophone</ref>

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
{{Main|Post-traumatic stress disorder}}
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder which results from a traumatic experience. Post-traumatic stress can result from an extreme situation, such as combat, natural disaster, rape, [[hostage]] situations, [[child abuse]], [[bullying]] or even a serious accident. It can also result from long term (chronic) exposure to a severe stressor,<ref>{{Cite book| title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the Family | publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada | url=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/ptsd_families# | isbn = 0-662-42627-4 | year=2006 | author=}}</ref> for example soldiers who endure individual battles but cannot [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with continuous combat. Common symptoms include [[hypervigilance]], [[Flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashbacks]], avoidant behaviors, anxiety, anger and depression.<ref name="psycho-prat" />
There are a number of treatments which form the basis of the care plan for those suffering with PTSD. Such treatments include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), psychotherapy and support from family and friends.<ref name="Barker2003"/>

===Separation anxiety===
{{Main|Separation anxiety disorder}}
Separation anxiety disorder (SepAD) is the feeling of excessive and inappropriate levels of anxiety over being separated from a person or place. Separation anxiety is a normal part of [[developmental psychology|development]] in babies or children, and it is only when this feeling is excessive or inappropriate that it can be considered a disorder.<ref>Siegler, Robert (2006). ''How Children Develop, Exploring Child Develop Student Media Tool Kit & Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop''. New York: Worth Publishers. ISBN 0-7167-6113-0.</ref> Separation anxiety disorder affects roughly 7% of adults and 4% of children, but the childhood cases tend to be more severe; in some instances, even a brief separation can produce panic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/13/30 |title=Adult Separation Anxiety Often Overlooked Diagnosis – Arehart-Treichel 41 (13): 30 – Psychiatr News |publisher=Pn.psychiatryonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Shear | first1 = K. | last2 = Jin | first2 = R. | last3 = Ruscio | first3 = AM. | last4 = Walters | first4 = EE. | last5 = Kessler | first5 = RC. | title = Prevalence and correlates of estimated DSM-IV child and adult separation anxiety disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |url= http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/163/6/1074 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 163 | issue = 6 | pages = 1074–1083 | month = Jun | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.163.6.1074 | pmid = 16741209 | pmc = 1924723 }}</ref>

===Situational Anxiety===
Situational anxiety is caused by new situations or changing events.  It can also be caused by various events that make that particular individual uncomfortable.  Its occurrence is very common.  Often, an individual will experience panic attacks or extreme anxiety in specific situations.  A situation that causes one individual to experience anxiety may not affect another individual, at all.   For example, some people become uneasy in crowds or tight spaces, so standing in a tightly packed line, say at the bank or a store register, may cause them to experience extreme anxiety, possibly a panic attack.<ref>Situational Panic Attacks.  (n.d.).  Retrieved from http://www.sound-mind.org/situational-panic-attacks.html</ref>  Others, however, may experience anxiety when major changes in life occur, such as entering college, getting married, having children, etc.

Treatment of situational anxiety can be similar to that of other anxiety disorders.  Often, a combination of medications and psychotherapy or counseling is recommended.<ref>London, R.  (2008).  Treating Situational Anxiety.  ''Clinical Psychiatry News, 36(8), 27.''</ref>  Medications usually include benzodiaepines or selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRI’s.  The most popular benzodiazepines include Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, and Ativan.<ref>Fernandez, C.A.  (2010, March 28).  Most Common Benzodiazepine Prescriptions.  Retrieved from http://www.livestrong.com/article/98779-common-benzodiazepine-prescriptions/</ref>  The most commonly prescribed SSRI’s are Lexapro, Celexa, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, and Symbyax.<ref>(2010, December 9).  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.  Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ssris/MH00066</ref>  However, depending on the degree of anxiety, counseling or psychotherapy alone can be sufficient.  The overall purpose of counseling or psychotherapy is to determine when the anxiety began, what situation(s) caused it, why the situation(s) caused it, and how to prevent it from happening again.  Other treatments for situational anxiety include relaxation techniques and hobbies.  Exercising and participation in sports has been proven to relieve stress, which is typically the rooted cause of the anxiety.  Yoga is a popular option because not only is it a form of exercise, but it also assists with relaxation and meditation.  Hypnosis is a more alternative form of treatment.<ref>London, R.  (2008).  Treating Situational Anxiety.  ''Clinical Psychiatry News, 36(8), 27.''</ref>

===Childhood anxiety disorders===
Children as well as adults experience feelings of anxiety, worry, and fear when facing different situations, especially those involving new experiences. However, if anxiety is no longer temporary and begins to interfere with the child's normal functioning or do harm to their learning, the problem may be diagnosed as more than just the ordinary anxiety typical in children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensanxietydisorder.com/childhood.html|title=Childhood Anxiety Disorder|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100529004728/http://www.childrensanxietydisorder.com/childhood.html| archivedate= 29 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

When children suffer from a severe anxiety disorder, their thinking, [[decision-making]] ability, perceptions of the environment, learning and [[concentration]] may be affected. They not only experience fear, nervousness, and [[shyness]] but also may start avoiding places and activities. Anxiety raises [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]] and can cause [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], stomach pain, [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[diarrhea]], tingling, weakness, and [[shortness of breath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/welcome/conditions/anxiety_disorders.html| title=Symtoms and Anxiety Disorders|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> Some other symptoms are self-doubt and [[self-criticism]], [[irritability]], [[sleep problems]] and, in extreme cases, thoughts of not wanting to be alive.

If these children are left untreated, they face risks such as poor results at school, avoidance of important social activities, and [[substance abuse]]. Children who suffer from an anxiety disorder are likely to suffer other disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit disorders]] both hyperactive and inattentive, and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorders]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/children| title=Children|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100421085132/http://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/children| archivedate= 21 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Research in this area is difficult to perform because as children grow their fears change, making it difficult for researchers to obtain enough data and thus more reliable results. Between the ages of six and eight, children's fear of the dark and imaginary creatures decreases, but they become more anxious about school performance and [[Interpersonal relationship|social relationships]]. If children experience an excessive amount of anxiety during this stage, this could lead to development of anxiety disorders later in life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/ca-0007/default.asp| title=Children's Mental Health Facts Children and Adolescents with Anxiety Disorders|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100527142707/http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/CA-0007/default.asp| archivedate= 27 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

Childhood anxiety disorders are caused by biological and psychological factors. Several studies have shown that maternal overcontrol is related to higher levels of child anxiety.<ref>Affruntil, Ginsburg, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/j2235619p4501g81/fulltext.html "Maternal Overcontrol and Child Anxiety: The Mediating Role of Perceived Competence"], ''Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine'', 2012</ref>  [[Stress (biology)|Stress]] can also trigger anxiety disorders. Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders have an increased physical and psychological reaction to stress. Their reaction to danger, even if it is a small one, is quicker and stronger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhawestchester.org/diagnosechild/canxiety.asp| title=What Causes Anxiety Disorders?|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100430055034/http://www.mhawestchester.org/diagnosechild/canxiety.asp| archivedate= 30 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

Many of the same anxiety disorders that affect adults affect children as well.  A common anxiety disorder in children is school phobia, which in some cases can be a type of separation anxiety.  Sometimes the anxiety has no obvious cause.  In other instances, the child may experience bullying from classmates, or even a teacher.  They could also be stressed from the workload they are given.  School phobia may also be a form of social phobia, also known as social anxiety.  Children with this disorder may avoid speaking in front of their classmates or meeting new people.  Typically, social phobia in children is caused by some traumatic event, such as not knowing an answer when called on in class.<ref>Biegel, D.E.  (1995).  Caregiver burden.  In G.E. Maddox (Ed.), ''The encyclopedia of aging'' (2,d ed., pp.  138-141).  New York:  Springer</ref>

Like adults, children may suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  The symptoms for both disorders are the same in children as they are in adults.  If a child has GAD, they may worry about anything, even if it is seemingly minor. They long for attention, approval, and encouragement from others.  The only difference is they are more likely to worry about things that relate to them.  Those things may include, grades, bullies, getting hurt, storms, etc.  The symptoms of OCD include repetitive and/or compulsive behaviors.<ref>Harvard Medical School.  (2004a, December).  Children's fears and anxieties.  ''Harvard Mental Health Letter, 21(6),'' 1-3.</ref>

It is more common for children whose parents have anxiety disorders to attain an anxiety disorder than it is for children whose parents do not have anxiety disorders.  Anxiety disorders are also more common among little girls than among little boys.<ref>Lewinsohn, P.M., Gotlib, I.H., Lewinsohn, M., Seeley, J.R., & Allen, N.B.  (1998).  Gender differences in anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms in adolescence.  ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 107,'' 109-117.</ref>

Several methods of treatment have been found to be effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders.  Like adults, children may undergo psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or counseling.  They may still be given medication such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s, but in much smaller doses.  However, administering potent medications like antidepressants to children is controversial.  As a result, other forms of treatment have become increasingly popular.  Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings.  Each family member may attend individual therapy, but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy.  Art and play therapy are also used.  Art therapy is most commonly used when the child will not or cannot verbally communicate, due to trauma or a disability in which they are nonverbal.  Participating in art activities allows the child to express what they otherwise may not be able to communicate to others.<ref>Kozlowska, K., & Hanney, L.  (1999).  Family assessment and intervention using an interactive are exercise.  ''Australia and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy, 20(2),'' 61-69.</ref>  In play therapy, the child is allowed to play however they please as a therapist observes them.  The therapist may intercede from time to time with a question, comment, or suggestion.  This is often most effective when the family of the child plays a significant role in the treatment.<ref>Bratton, S.C., & Ray, D.  (2002).  Humanistic play therapy.  In D.J. Cain (Ed.), ''Humanistic psychotherapies:  Handbook of research and practice'' (pp.  369-402).  Washington, DC:  American Psychological Association.</ref>

==Causes==

===Biological===
Low levels of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], a neurotransmitter that reduces activity in the central nervous system, contribute to anxiety. A number of [[anxiolytic]]s achieve their effect by modulating the GABA receptors.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lydiard RB

Severe anxiety and depression can be induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence.

====Amygdala====
The [[amygdala]] is central to the processing of fear and anxiety, and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders.<ref name="Etkin">{{cite journal | author = Etkin A, Prater KE, Schatzberg AF, Menon V, Greicius MD | year = 2009 | title = Disrupted amygdalar subregion functional connectivity and evidence of a compensatory network in generalized anxiety disorder | url = | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 12| pages = 1361–1372 | pmid = 19996041 | doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.104}}</ref> Sensory information enters the amygdala through the nuclei of the basolateral complex (consisting of lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei). The basolateral complex processes sensory-related fear memories and communicates their threat importance to memory and sensory processing elsewhere in the brain, such as the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and sensory cortices.

Another important area is the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala, which controls species-specific fear responses, via connections to the [[brainstem]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[cerebellum]] areas. In those with general anxiety disorder, these connections functionally seem to be less distinct, with greater [[gray matter]] in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[cingulate]] areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the [[parietal cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] circuits that underlie [[executive function]]s.<ref name="Etkin"/>

The latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety. Researchers have noted "Amygdalofrontoparietal coupling in generalized anxiety disorder patients may&nbsp;... reflect the habitual engagement of a cognitive control system to regulate excessive anxiety."<ref name="Etkin"/> This is consistent with cognitive theories that suggest the use in this disorder of attempts to reduce the involvement of emotions with compensatory cognitive strategies.

Clinical and animal studies suggest a correlation between anxiety disorders and difficulty in maintaining balance.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Kalueff AV, Ishikawa K, Griffith AJ

Anxiety processing in the [[basolateral]] amygdala has been implicated with [[dendritic|dendritic arborization]] of the amygdaloid neurons. [[KCNN2|SK2]] potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization. By overexpressing SK2 in the basolateral amygdala, anxiety in experimental animals can be reduced together with general levels of stress-induced [[corticosterone]] secretion.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Stress===
Anxiety disorders can arise in response to life stresses such as financial worries or chronic physical illness. Somewhere between 4% and 10% of older adults are diagnosed with anxiety disorder, a figure that is probably an underestimate due to the tendency of adults to minimize psychiatric problems or to focus on their physical manifestations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Anxiety is also common among older people who have [[dementia]]. On the other hand, anxiety disorder is sometimes misdiagnosed among older adults when doctors misinterpret symptoms of a physical ailment (for instance, racing heartbeat due to [[cardiac arrhythmia]]) as signs of anxiety.<ref name="Calleo">{{Cite journal|author=Calleo J, Stanley M |title=Anxiety Disorders in Later Life: Differentiated Diagnosis and Treatment Strategies |journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=26 |issue=8 |year=2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1166976}}</ref>

==Prevention==

Focus is increasing on [[Mental disorders#Prevention|prevention of anxiety disorders]].<ref name=Bien2007>{{cite journal|last=Bienvenu|first=OJ|coauthors=Ginsburg, GS|title=Prevention of anxiety disorders|journal=International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)|date=2007 Dec|volume=19|issue=6|pages=647–54|pmid=18092242|doi=10.1080/09540260701797837}}</ref> There is tentative evidence to support the use of [[cognitive behavior therapy]] (CBT).<ref name=Bien2007/>

==Diagnosis==
Anxiety disorders are often debilitating [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] conditions, which can be present from an early age or begin suddenly after a [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|trigger]]ing event. They are prone to flare up at times of high [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and are frequently accompanied by physiological symptoms such as [[headache]], [[sweating]], [[muscle spasms]], [[tachycardia]], [[palpitations]], and [[hypertension]], which in some cases lead to [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] or even [[exhaustion]].

In casual discourse the words "anxiety" and "fear" are often used interchangeably; in clinical usage, they have distinct meanings: "[[anxiety]]" is defined as an unpleasant emotional state for which the cause is either not readily identified or perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable, whereas "fear" is an emotional and physiological response to a recognized external threat. The term "anxiety disorder" includes fears (phobias) as well as anxieties.

Anxiety disorders are often [[comorbid]] with other mental disorders, particularly [[clinical depression]], which may occur in as many as 60% of people with anxiety disorders. The fact that there is considerable overlap between symptoms of anxiety and depression, and that the same environmental triggers can provoke symptoms in either condition, may help to explain this high rate of comorbidity.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cameron OG |title=Understanding Comorbid Depression and Anxiety |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=14 |date=December 1, 2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/anxiety/article/10168/53896}}</ref>

Studies have also indicated that anxiety disorders are more likely among those with family history of anxiety disorders, especially certain types.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = McLaughlin K | coauthors = Behar E, Borkovec T | date =   August 25, 2005 |   title = Family history of psychological problems in generalized anxiety disorder | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 64 | pages = 905–918 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119485012/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20497 | pmid = 18509873 | issue = 7}}</ref>

[[Sexual dysfunction]] often accompanies anxiety disorders, although it is difficult to determine whether anxiety causes the sexual dysfunction or whether they arise from a common cause. The most common manifestations in individuals with anxiety disorder are avoidance of intercourse, premature ejaculation or erectile dysfunction among men and pain during intercourse among women. Sexual dysfunction is particularly common among people affected by panic disorder (who may fear that a panic attack will occur during sexual arousal) and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Coretti G, Baldi I |title= The Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders and Sexual Dysfunction|journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=9 |date=August 1, 2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/anxiety/article/10168/54881}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The most important clinical point to emerge from studies of social anxiety disorder is the benefit of early diagnosis and treatment. Social anxiety disorder remains under-recognized in [[primary care]] practice, with patients often presenting for treatment only after the onset of [[complication (medicine)|complications]] such as [[clinical depression]] or  substance abuse disorders.

Treatment options available include lifestyle changes; [[psychotherapy]], especially [[cognitive behavioral therapy#Anxiety disorders|cognitive behavioral therapy]]; and pharmaceutical therapy. Education, reassurance and some form of cognitive-behavioral therapy should almost always be used in treatment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Research has provided evidence for the [[efficacy]] of two forms of treatment available for social phobia: certain medications and a specific form of short-term psychotherapy called [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), the central component being gradual exposure therapy. Self-help books can contribute to the treatment of people with anxiety disorders.<ref>{{cite web|author=Warren Mansell |url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/31/6/238.2.full |title=Reading about self-help books on cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders |publisher=Pb.rcpsych.org |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

===Psychotherapy===
Research has shown that [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT) can be highly effective for several anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder and social phobia.<ref name="cbt">Jonathan R. T. Davidson, MD; Edna B. Foa, PhD; ''et al.'' [http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/10/1005 ''Fluoxetine, Comprehensive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Placebo in Generalized Social Phobia''] 1998. Retrieved March 1, 2006.</ref> CBT, as its name suggests, has two main components: cognitive and behavioral. In cases of social anxiety, the cognitive component can help the patient question how they can be so sure that others are continually watching and harshly judging him or her. The behavioral component seeks to change people's reactions to anxiety-provoking situations.

As such it serves as a logical extension of cognitive therapy, whereby people are shown proof in the real world that their dysfunctional thought processes are unrealistic. A key element of this component is gradual exposure, in which the patient is confronted by the things they fear in a structured, sensitive manner. Gradual exposure is an inherently unpleasant technique; ideally it involves exposure to a feared social situation that is anxiety provoking but bearable, for as long as possible, two to three times a week. Often, a hierarchy of feared steps is constructed and the patient is exposed to each step sequentially.

The aim is to learn from acting differently and observing reactions. This is intended to be done with support and guidance, and when the therapist and patient feel they are ready. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for social phobia also includes anxiety management training, which may include techniques such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation exercises, which may be practiced '[[in-situ]]'. CBT can also be conducted partly in [[group therapy|group sessions]], facilitating the sharing of experiences, a sense of acceptance by others and undertaking behavioral challenges in a trusted environment (Heimberg).

Some studies have suggested social skills training can help with social anxiety.<ref>Mersch ''et al.'', 1991</ref> However, it is not clear whether specific social skills techniques and training are required, rather than just support with general social functioning and exposure to social situations.<ref>Stravynski & Amado, 2001</ref>

Additionally, a recent study has suggested that [[interpersonal therapy]], a form of psychotherapy primarily used to treat depression, may also be effective in the treatment of social phobia.<ref>Lipsitz et al., 1999</ref>

===Medications===
When medication is indicated, [[SSRIs]] are generally recommended as first line agents, [[SNRIs]] are also effective but may be associated with withdrawal and adverse effects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Nortriptyline]] is associated with higher relapse due to its toxic metabolite. [[Benzodiazepines]] are also sometimes indicated for short-term or [[Pro re nata|PRN]] use. They are usually considered as a second-line treatment due to disadvantages such as cognitive impairment and due to their risks of [[Substance use disorder|dependence]] and [[withdrawal]] problems.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Stein |first1=Dan J |title=Clinical Manual of Anxiety Disorders |url=http://books.google.com/?id=44reFIgFDBMC |edition=1st |date=16 February 2004 |publisher=American Psychiatric Press Inc |location=USA | isbn = 978-1-58562-076-0 |page=7 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref> [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors|MAOIs]] such as [[phenelzine]] (Nardil) and [[tranylcypromine]] (Parnate) are considered an effective treatment and are especially useful in treatment-resistant cases, however, dietary restrictions and medical interactions may limit their use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stahlonline.cambridge.org/prescribers_drug.jsf?page=0521683505c89_p505-510.html.therapeutics&name=Tranylcypromine&title=Therapeutics |title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology - Cambridge University Press |publisher=Stahlonline.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stahlonline.cambridge.org/prescribers_drug.jsf?page=0521683505c69_p395-400.html.therapeutics&name=Phenelzine&title=Therapeutics |title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology - Cambridge University Press |publisher=Stahlonline.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> There is evidence that certain newer medications including the [[GABA|GABA analogue]] [[pregabalin]] (Lyrica) and the novel antidepressant [[mirtazapine]] (Remeron) are effective treatments for anxiety disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stahlonline.cambridge.org/prescribers_drug.jsf?page=0521683505c72_p413-416.html.therapeutics&name=Pregabalin&title=Therapeutics |title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology - Cambridge University Press |publisher=Stahlonline.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stahlonline.cambridge.org/prescribers_drug.jsf?page=0521683505c57_p325-330.html.therapeutics&name=Mirtazapine&title=Therapeutics |title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology - Cambridge University Press |publisher=Stahlonline.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> [[tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]] such as [[imipramine]], as well as atypical antipsychotics such as [[quetiapine]], and [[piperazines]] such as [[hydroxyzine]] are occasionally prescribed.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Llorca PM |title=Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–1027 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12444816 |url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n11/v63n1112.pdf|doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n1112|author-separator=,|author2=Spadone C|author3=Sol O|display-authors=3|last4=Danniau|first4=Anne|last5=Bougerol|first5=Thierry|last6=Corruble|first6=Emmanuelle|last7=Faruch|first7=Michel|last8=Macher|first8=Jean-Paul|last9=Sermet|first9=Eric}}</ref> In children and adolescents, when a medication option is warranted, antidepressants such as SSRIs, SNRIs as well as tricyclic antidepressants can be effective as well as efficacious.

====SSRIs====
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), a class of antidepressants, are considered by many to be the first choice medication for generalised social phobia. These drugs elevate the level of the neurotransmitter serotonin, among other effects. The first drug formally approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] was [[paroxetine]], sold as [[Paxil]] in the U.S. or [[Seroxat]] in the UK. Compared to older forms of medication, there is less risk of tolerability and drug dependency.<ref>{{Cite book|coauthors=Stuart Montgomery, Hans Den Boer|title=SSRIs in Depression and Anxiety| isbn = 0-470-84136-2 |pages=109–111|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|author=ed. by Stuart A. Montgomery&nbsp;... |year=2001}}</ref> However, their [[efficacy]] and increased suicide risk has been subject to controversy.

General [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] are common during the first weeks while the body adjusts to the drug. Symptoms may include [[headache]]s, [[nausea]], [[insomnia]] and changes in sexual behavior. Treatment safety during pregnancy has not been established.<ref>{{EMedicine|med|3121|Social Phobia}}</ref> In late 2004 much media attention was given to a proposed link between SSRI use and [[teenage suicide|juvenile suicide]]. For this reason, the use of SSRIs in pediatric cases of depression is now recognized by the Food and Drug Administration as warranting a cautionary statement to the parents of children who may be prescribed SSRIs by a family doctor.<ref name="fda-warning">Federal Drug and Administration.

However, due to the nature of the conditions, those taking SSRIs for social phobias are far less likely to have suicidal ideation than those with depression.

====Other drugs====
The [[atypical antipsychotic]] [[quetiapine]] appears effective in generalized anxiety disorder, however rates of adverse effects is greater than that with SSRIs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Depping|first=AM|coauthors=Komossa, K; Kissling, W; Leucht, S|title=Second-generation antipsychotics for anxiety disorders|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010 Dec 8|issue=12|pages=CD008120|pmid=21154392|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008120.pub2|editor1-last=Leucht|editor1-first=Stefan}}</ref>

[[Benzodiazepine]]s such as [[alprazolam]] and [[clonazepam]] are an alternative to SSRIs. These drugs are often used for short-term relief of severe, disabling anxiety.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Westenberg | first1 = HG. | title = Facing the challenge of social anxiety disorder | journal = Eur Neuropsychopharmacol | volume = 9 Suppl 3 | pages = S93–9 | month = Jul | year = 1999 | pmid = 10523064| doi = 10.1016/S0924-977X(99)00029-2 }}</ref> Although benzodiazepines are still sometimes prescribed for long-term everyday use, there is concern over the development of [[drug tolerance]], [[chemical dependency|dependency]] and [[Recreational drug use|recreational abuse]].

Some people with a form of social phobia called performance phobia have been helped by [[beta-blocker]]s, which are more commonly used to control high blood pressure. Taken in low doses, they control the physical manifestation of anxiety and can be taken before a public performance.

Treatment controversy arises because while some studies indicate that a combination of medication and psychotherapy can be more effective than either one alone, others suggest pharmacological interventions are largely palliative, and can actually interfere with the mechanisms of successful therapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hollon S |coauthors=Stewart O, Strunk D |date=  August 25, 2005 |title=Enduring effects for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=57 |pages=285–315 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190044 |url=http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/strunk/personal/Hollon,%20Stewart,%20&%20Strunk%20enduring%20effects%20AR%202006.pdf  |format=PDF |pmid=16318597 }}</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] indicates that psychotherapeutic interventions have better long-term efficacy compared to pharmacotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gould RA, Otto MW, Pollack MH, Yap L |title=Cognitive behavioral and pharmacological treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A preliminary meta-analysis |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=285–305 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(97)80048-2 }}</ref> However, the right treatment may very much depend on the individual patient's genetics and environmental factors.

Caffeine can be beneficial in that it has the ability to clear the mind, increase focus, and essentially help individuals stay awake for extended periods of time.  Unfortunately, it also has the ability to hinder one’s cognitive functioning.  When it produces these negative affects, the individual is said to have caffeinism.  Caffeinism results from excessive consumption of substances like coffee, tea, headache medications, etc.  It has been known to cause severe anxiety, along with more minor effects, such as muscle twitchings, hand tremors, and headaches.  The best way to prevent caffeinism is to either wean off of caffeine completely or reduce consumption.<ref>Hire, J.N.  (1978).  Anxiety and Caffeine.
