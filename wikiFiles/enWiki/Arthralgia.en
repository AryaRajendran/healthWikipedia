According to [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]], the term "arthralgia" should only be used when the condition is non-inflammatory, and the term "arthritis" should be used when the condition is [[inflammation|inflammatory]].<ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2008/MB_cgi?field=uid&term=D018771 |title=MeSH |accessdate=2007-12-23 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis and causes==
Diagnosis involves interviewing the patient and performing [[physical exam]]s. When attempting to establish the cause of the arthralgia, the emphasis is on the interview.<ref name="jgh_arthralgia"/> The patient is asked questions intended to narrow the number of potential causes. Given the varied nature of these possible causes, some questions may seem irrelevant. For example, the patient may be asked about [[dry mouth]], [[light sensitivity]], [[rash]]es or a history of [[seizure]]s.<ref name="jgh_arthralgia"/><ref name="spondyl_table1" >{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=arthralgia&rid=cm.chapter.5910#5949

The causes of ''arthralgia'' are varied and range,  from a joints perspective, from degenerative and destructive processes such as [[Arthritic|osteoarthritis]] and sports injuries to inflammation of tissues surrounding the joints, such as [[bursitis]].<ref name="nihbook_2">{{cite web  |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?indexed=google&rid=cm.chapter.4738

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on a specific underlying cause. The underlying cause will be treated first and foremost. The treatments may include [[joint replacement]] surgery, for severely damaged joints, [[immunosuppressants]] for immune system dysfunction, antibiotics when an infection is the cause, and discontinuing medication when an allergic reaction is the cause. Conservative chiropractic care has also shown to be beneficial in the relief of symptoms.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} When treating the primary cause, pain management may still play a role in treatment. The extent of its role varies depending on the specific cause of the ''arthralgia''. Pain management may include stretching exercises, over the counter pain medications, prescription pain medication, or other treatments deemed appropriate for the symptoms.
