An [[anesthesiologist]], he is the founder of [[SMURD|Mobile Emergency Service for Resuscitation and Extrication]] (SMURD), as well as the coordinator of [[Mureş County]]. He is also the [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Minister of Health]] since 7 November 2012, after serving as Under-Secretary of State for Health in the [[Romanian Government]].<ref>http://www.dw.de/o-alegere-unanim%C4%83/a-16362154</ref>

==Early life==
Arafat was born in [[Damascus]] to a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] couple from [[Nablus]]. He worked as a volunteer in [[emergency medicine]] from the age of 14.<ref name="rompres">{{ro icon}} [http://www.postamedicala.ro/component/option,com_/Itemid,101/option,content/task,view/id,2328/ 2006 interview with Raed Arafat], hosted by [[Rompres]]</ref><ref name="news4">{{ro icon}} Andi Laslau, [http://news.4romania.com/Arabii-din-romania-radiografie-completa_42064.html "Arabii din România, radiografie completă"], at News4Romania.ro</ref> In 1981 he emigrated to [[Romania]] and initially settled in [[Piteşti]], where he took [[Romanian language]] classes.

==Education==
Arafat enrolled at the [[Iuliu Haţieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy|University of Medicine and Pharmacy]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]].<ref name="rompres"/><ref name="news4"/> He later moved to the [[University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Târgu Mureş|Târgu Mureş University of Medicine]], where he underwent specialization in anesthesiology.<ref name="news4"/><ref name="galasociet">{{ro icon}} [http://www.galasocietatiicivile.ro/index.php?menuid=92#46 "Raed Arafat" at ''Gala Societăţii Civile'']</ref> He completed a number of specialist courses abroad, training with the [[Paris Fire Brigade]], the [[United States National Guard]], and the [[Norwegian Air Ambulance]].<ref name="galasociet"/>

==Career==
Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], Arafat contemplated leaving for [[France]], but his application was rejected,<ref name="rompres"/> so he concentrated instead on creating an emergency service in [[Târgu Mureş]] (which he originally financed with personal funds).<ref name="rompres"/> 

In 1991, he created SMURD, a mobile emergency service which began collaborating with the Romanian firefighting service<ref name="rompres"/> and the [[Fire service in the United Kingdom|Fire service]] of [[Scotland]],<ref name="news4"/> working for it as a volunteer until 1998, when he gained Romanian citizenship.<ref name="rompres"/><ref name="news4"/>

==Politics==
In late 2005, his project to have SMURD function as an additional rescue service at a [[Counties of Romania|county]] level was passed into law, but raised opposition from the physician and [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic]] politician [[Sorin Oprescu]], who had drafted an alternative proposal.<ref name="getaroman">{{ro icon}} Geta Roman, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=2541&art=5119&diraut=39&cHash=3bd7157762 "Ayatollah-ul Arafat l-a învins de urgenţă pe feudalul Oprescu"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', October 25, 2005</ref> A reference to Arafat as "the [[Ayatollah]] of Romanian emergency medicine" and the stress he placed on the latter's country of origin brought Oprescu to the attention of the [[Consiliul Naţional pentru Combaterea Discriminării|National Anti-Discrimination Office]].<ref name="getaroman"/>

<ref name="arafatavantaje">{{ro icon}} Irina Dimiu, [http://www.avantaje.ro/index.php?a=1791&p=2 "«Hobbyul meu: să salvez oameni»" (interview with Raed Arafat), p.2], in ''[[Avantaje]]''</ref> A [[first aid]] instructor, he coordinated international lectures on the matter in several countries (including [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]).<ref name="galasociet"/> In 2003, he was made a Knight of the [[National Order of Merit of Romania]] (a Grand Officer since 2005).<ref name="galasociet"/>

Since August, 2009, he has held the position of Under-Secretary of State for Health.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8201729.stm|title=Romanian bus collision kills 11 |date=14 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>
