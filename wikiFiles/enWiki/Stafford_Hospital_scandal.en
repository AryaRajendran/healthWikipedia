The '''Stafford Hospital scandal''' concerns unusually high mortality rates amongst patients at the [[Stafford Hospital]], [[Stafford]], England, in the late 2000s.
==Background==
The scandal came to light because of an investigation by the [[Healthcare Commission]]{{when|date=February 2013}} into the operation of [[Stafford Hospital]] in [[Stafford]], England. The commission was first alerted by the "apparently high mortality rates in patients admitted as emergencies".<ref name=HCReport>{{citation|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/_db/_documents/Investigation_into_Mid_Staffordshire_NHS_Foundation_Trust.pdf|title=Investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust|publisher=Healthcare Commission |date=March 2009|isbn=978-1-84562-220-6|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref>  When the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]], which is responsible for running the hospital, failed to provide what the commission considered an adequate explanation, a full-scale investigation was carried out between March and October 2008.<ref name=HCReport/> Released in March 2009, the commission's report severely criticised the [[NHS Foundation Trust|Foundation Trust]]'s management and detailed the appalling conditions and inadequacies at the hospital. Many press reports suggested that because of the substandard care between 400 and 1200 more patients died between 2005 and 2008 than would be expected for the type of hospital,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5008935/NHS-targets-may-have-led-to-1200-deaths-in-Mid-Staffordshire.html |title=NHS targets 'may have led to 1,200 deaths' in Mid-Staffordshire |author=Rebecca Smith (Medical Editor) |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 March 2009 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref name=Mirror>{{cite news |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/03/18/up-to-1-200-may-have-died-over-shocking-patient-care-at-stafford-hospital-115875-21206422/ |author=Emily Cook |title=Stafford hospital scandal: Up to 1,200 may have died over "shocking" patient care |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref> though in fact such ‘excess’ death statistics did not appear in the final Healthcare Commission report.<ref name=HC375>{{citation |url=http://www.midstaffsinquiry.com/assets/docs/Inquiry_Report-Vol1.pdf |title=Independent Inquiry into care provided by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust January 2005 – March 2009 |chapter=Volume I, Section G: Mortality statistics |page=352 |author=Robert Francis QC |publisher=The Stationery Office |date=24 February 2010 |id=HC375-I |isbn=978-0-10-296439-4 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |quote=it has been concluded that it would be unsafe to infer from the figures that there was any particular number or range of numbers of avoidable or unnecessary deaths at the Trust.}}</ref>

As a result, the trust's chief executive, Martin Yeates, was suspended (with full pay), while its chairman, Toni Brisby, resigned.<ref name=Mirror/> Both Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] and Health Secretary [[Alan Johnson]] apologised to those who suffered at the hospital.<ref name=Mirror/><ref name=Sentinel>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Breaking-News-Gordon-Brown-says-sorry-Stafford-Hospital-scandalarticle-779452-details/article.html |title=Gordon Brown says sorry for Stafford Hospital scandal |author=R Bramwell |publisher=The Sentinel |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref> Also in response to the scandal, the mortality rates of all [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] hospitals have been made accessible on a website.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5264078/Death-rates-victory-after-Stafford-scandal.html |title=Death rates victory after Stafford scandal |author=Laura Donnelly |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

In March 2009 it was revealed that executives who had run the NHS trust at the time actually received promotions within the health service.  Most notably Cynthia Bower, who was from 2006 chief executive of the trust's parent body, [[NHS West Midlands]], was recruited to run the [[Care Quality Commission]] quango.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5007652/Stafford-Hospital-execs-land-higly-paid-jobs.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rebecca | last=Smith | title=Stafford Hospital execs land {{sic|nolink=y|higly-paid|expected=highly-paid}} jobs | date=18 March 2009}}</ref>

On 21 July 2009, the [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Andrew Burnham]], announced a further independent inquiry into care provided by Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust. The generally critical inquiry report was published on 24 February 2010. The report made 18 local and national recommendations, including that the regulator, [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], de-authorise the [[NHS Foundation Trust|Foundation Trust]].<ref name=francis-report>{{cite book|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113018|title=Robert Francis Inquiry report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust|author=Robert Francis QC|publisher=House of Commons|date=24 February 2010|isbn=978-0-10-296439-4|accessdate=24 February 2010}}</ref> 

Compensation payments averaging £11,000 were paid to some of the families involved.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/oct/31/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust-compensation |title=NHS trust pays compensation to victims of 'appalling' patient care |work=Press Association |publisher=The Guardian |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

In February 2010, Burnham agreed to a further independent inquiry of the commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies for Foundation Trusts.<ref name=francis-report />

==Public inquiry==
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}
In June 2010, the new government announced that a full [[public inquiry]] would be held.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5264078/Death-rates-victory-after-Stafford-scandal.html |title=Public inquiry into scandal-hit Stafford Hospital |author=Nick Triggle |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2010 |location=London}}</ref> The inquiry began on 8 November 2010 chaired by Robert Francis QC, who had chaired the fourth inquiry which he had criticised for its narrow remit. The inquiry considered more than a million pages of previous evidence as well as hearing from witnesses.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11696735 |title=Stafford Hospital public inquiry opens |publisher=BBC |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=8 November 2010}}</ref>

The final report was published on 6 February 2013, making 290 recommendations.<ref name=bbc-20130206>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21341766 |title=Stafford Hospital: Hiding mistakes 'should be criminal offence' |author=Nick Triggle |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=francis-report-2013>{{cite report |url=http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report |title=Report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry. |author=Robert Francis QC |publisher=House of Commons |isbn=9780102981476 |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Academics at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[King's College London]] have criticised its recommendations to legally enforce a new duty of openness, transparency and candour amongst NHS staff, arguing that increasing 'micro-regulation' may produce serious unintended consequences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Press Release|title=Study on clinical risk controls in the NHS|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/newsandevents/releases/Pages/ClinicalRiskControls.aspx|work=Said Business School, University of Oxford|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>  In their research on the effects of different forms of regulation in healthcare, [http://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues found rules-based regulation tends to erode values-based self regulation, producing professional defensiveness and contradictions which undermine, rather than support, good patient care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|coauthors=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|coauthors=Fischer, Michael Daniel|title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035}}</ref>  The revelations of the abuse at Stafford hospital were widely considered to be deeply shocking by all sections of the mainstream UK press; for example, patients were left in their own urine by nurses, and forced to resort to drinking from flower pots.
