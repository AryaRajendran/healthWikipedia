'''Benign nephrosclerosis''' is the renal changes occurring in the setting of [[benign hypertension]], which is always associated with [[hyaline arteriolosclerosis]].

==Morphology==

The kidneys appear symmetrically [[Atrophy|atrophic]], each weighing 110-130 grams. The kidneys have a surface of diffuse, fine granularity that resembles grain leather. Microscopically, the basic anatomic change consists of hyaline thickening of the walls of the small arteries and arterioles (hyaline arteriolosclerosis). Under a microscope, this appears as a homogeneous, pink [[hyaline]] thickening at the expense of the vessel [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumina]], with loss of underlying cellular detail. The narrowing of the lumen restricts blood flow, resulting in [[ischemia]]. All structures of the kidney show ischemic atrophy. In advanced cases of benign nephrosclerosis the [[Glomerulus|glomerular]] tufts may become globally sclerosed. Diffuse tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are present. Often there is a scant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate. The larger blood vessels (interlobar and arcuate arteries) show reduplication of [[internal elastic lamina]] along with fibrous thickening of the media (fibroelastic hyperplasia) and the subintima.

==Clinical Course==

Benign nephrosclerosis alone hardly ever causes severe damage to the kidney, except in susceptible populations, such as African Americans, where it may lead to [[uremia]] and death. However, all persons with this disease usually show some functional impairment, such as loss of concentration or a variably diminished [[Glomerular filtration rate|GFR]]. A mild degree of [[proteinuria]] is a frequent finding.<ref name="isbn0-8089-2366-8">{{cite book |author=Robbins, Stanley L.; Kumar, Vinay |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Robbins basic pathology |edition= |language= |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |location= |year=2007 |origyear= |pages= |quote= |isbn=0-8089-2366-8 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>
