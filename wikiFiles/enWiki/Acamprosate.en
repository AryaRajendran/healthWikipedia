==Physiological action==
[[File:Acamprosate Calcium Structural Formulae.png|200px|thumb|acamprosate calcium]]
===GABA===
Ethanol acts in the central nervous system by binding to the GABA-A receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., it is a positive allosteric modulator). In chronic alcohol abuse, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABA-A receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. becoming generally less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the GABA-system).  When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect; compounded with the fact that GABA normally inhibits action potential formation, there are not as many receptors for GABA to bind to — meaning that sympathetic activation is unopposed, leading to sympathetic over-stimulation. Acamprosate's mechanism of action is supposed to be, at least partially, due to its agonist effect on GABA-receptors. 

===NMDA===
In addition, alcohol also inhibits activity of [[biochemical receptor]]s called [[N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor]]s, or NMDARs, so that chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction ([[upregulation]]) of these receptors . Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of [[delirium tremens]] and [[excitotoxicity|excitotoxic]] neuronal death.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = G | last2 = Coyle | first2 = JT | title = The role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of alcoholism | journal = Annual review of medicine | volume = 49 | pages = 173–84 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9509257 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.173 }}</ref>  [[Withdrawal]] from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s like [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], which activates NMDARs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = GE | last2 = Ragan | first2 = P | last3 = Chang | first3 = R | last4 = Chen | first4 = S | last5 = Linnoila | first5 = VM | last6 = Coyle | first6 = JT | title = Increased glutamatergic neurotransmission and oxidative stress after alcohol withdrawal | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/155/6/726 | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 155 | issue = 6 | pages = 726–32 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9619143 }}</ref>  Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge.<ref name="De Witte 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = De Witte | first1 = P | last2 = Littleton | first2 = J | last3 = Parot | first3 = P | last4 = Koob | first4 = G | title = Neuroprotective and abstinence-promoting effects of acamprosate: elucidating the mechanism of action | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 517–37 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15963001 }}</ref>    The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = S | last2 = Harris | first2 = BR | last3 = Gibson | first3 = DA | last4 = Blanchard | first4 = JA | last5 = Prendergast | first5 = MA | last6 = Holley | first6 = RC | last7 = Littleton | first7 = J | title = Acamprosate, MK-801, and ifenprodil inhibit neurotoxicity and calcium entry induced by ethanol withdrawal in organotypic slice cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus | journal = Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1468–78 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12394279 | doi = 10.1097/01.ALC.0000033261.14548.D2 }}</ref> and from glutamate exposure combined with [[ethanol withdrawal]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Al Qatari | first1 = M | last2 = Khan | first2 = S | last3 = Harris | first3 = B | last4 = Littleton | first4 = J | title = Acamprosate is neuroprotective against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity when enhanced by ethanol withdrawal in neocortical cultures of fetal rat brain | journal = Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1276–83 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11584146 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02348.x }}</ref> 

A study at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]'s Brain Research Institute suggested that acamprosate might be efficacious treating nicotine addiction in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21522053 | year = 2011 | last1 = Pechnick | first1 = RN | last2 = Manalo | first2 = CM | last3 = Lacayo | first3 = LM | last4 = Vit | first4 = JP | last5 = Bholat | first5 = Y | last6 = Spivak | first6 = I | last7 = Reyes | first7 = KC | last8 = Farrokhi | first8 = C | title = Acamprosate attenuates cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior in rats | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 222–7 | doi = 10.1097/FBP.0b013e328345f72c | journal = Behavioural Pharmacology }}</ref>

===Possible neuroprotective effects===
In addition to its apparent ability to help patients refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is [[neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] (that is, it protects [[neuron]]s from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, or possibly other insults).<ref name=MannReview/><ref name="De Witte 2005"/> For example, acamprosate has been found to protect [[cell culture|cultured cells]] from damage induced by [[ischemia]] (inadequate blood flow).<ref name=Engelhard2006>{{cite journal | last = Engelhard | first = K | coauthors = Werner C, Lu H, Mollenberg O, Zieglgansberger W, Kochs E | title = The neuroprotective effect of the glutamate antagonist acamprosate following experimental cerebral ischemia.

One Brazilian study has shown that acamprosate may be an effective treatment for [[tinnitus]] (persistent ringing in the ears due to hearing loss).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Azevedo AA, Figueiredo RR |title=Tinnitus treatment with acamprosate: double-blind study |journal=Braz J Otorhinolaryngol |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=618–23 |year=2005 |pmid=16612523 |doi=10.1590/S0034-72992005000500012 |url=}}</ref>

==Approval==
While the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the [[United States]] approved this drug in July 2004, it has been legal in [[Europe]] since 1989. After it approved the drug, the FDA released this statement:<blockquote>While its mechanism of action is not fully understood, Campral is thought to act on the [[brain]] pathways related to alcohol abuse. Campral was demonstrated to be safe and effective by multiple [[placebo]]-controlled [[clinical trial|clinical studies]] involving alcohol-dependent patients who had already been withdrawn from alcohol, (i.e., [[Drug rehabilitation|detoxified]]). Campral proved superior to placebo in maintaining [[abstinence]] (keeping patients off alcohol consumption), as indicated by a greater percentage of acamprosate-treated subjects being assessed as continuously abstinent throughout treatment. Campral is not [[Substance dependence|addicting]] and was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. The most common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse events]] reported for patients taking Campral included [[headache]], [[diarrhea]], [[flatulence]], and [[nausea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/answers/2004/ANS01302.html |title=FDA Approves New Drug for Treatment of Alcoholism |accessdate=2009-08-15 |date=2004-07-29 |work=FDA Talk Paper |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117175319/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/answers/2004/ANS01302.html |archivedate=2008-01-17}}</ref></blockquote>

==Clinical study results==
The [[Scripps Research Institute]] conducted a [[double blind]] study comparing acamprosate and [[placebo]]s, in combination with [[psychotherapy]], in the effectiveness of treating alcohol dependence. The researchers concluded that acamprosate is "safe and effective" as acamprosate increased the percentage of alcohol-free days.<ref name=Mason2006>{{cite journal | last = Mason | first = BJ | coauthors = Goodman AM, Chabac S, Lehert P | title = Effect of oral acamprosate on abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial: The role of patient motivation | journal = J Psychiatr Res | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 383&ndash;393 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16546214 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.02.002}}</ref>

Another study was conducted by [[Princess Alexandra Hospital]] in [[Brisbane]] comparing the use of acamprosate, [[naltrexone]], or both drugs at once (with each pharmacological treatment also paired with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]) in a 12-week study.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Feeney | first = GF| coauthors = Connor JP, Young RM, Tucker J, McPherson A| title = Combined acamprosate and naltrexone, with cognitive behavioural therapy is superior to either medication alone for alcohol abstinence: A single centre's experience with pharmacotherapy| journal = Alcohol Alcohol| volume = 41| issue = 3| pages = 321&ndash;327| year = 2006| pmid = 16467406| doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agl007}}</ref> This study concluded that a combination of medications was generally more popular and yielded better results than using either drug alone, as outlined below.
