'''Acute respiratory distress syndrome'''  ('''ARDS'''), also known as '''respiratory distress syndrome''' ('''RDS''') or '''adult respiratory distress syndrome''' (in contrast with [[infant respiratory distress syndrome|IRDS]]) is a life-threatening reaction to injuries or acute infection to the [[human lung|lung]].
ARDS is a severe [[human lung|lung]] syndrome (not a disease) with direct and indirect causes. [[Inflammation]] of the lung [[parenchyma]] leads to impaired [[gas exchange]] with systemic release of [[inflammation mediators|inflammatory mediator]]s, causing [[inflammation]], [[hypoxemia]] and frequently [[multiple organ failure]]. This condition has a 90% death rate in untreated patients. With treatment, usually [[mechanical ventilation]] in an [[intensive care unit]], the death rate is 50%. A less severe form is called [[acute lung injury]] ('''ALI''').

ARDS formerly most commonly signified ''adult respiratory distress syndrome'' to differentiate it from [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]] in premature infants. However, as this type of pulmonary edema also occurs in children, ''ARDS'' has gradually shifted to mean ''acute'' rather than ''adult''. The differences with the typical infant syndrome remain.

==Signs and symptoms==
People usually present with [[shortness of breath]], [[tachypnea]] leading to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and providing less oxygen to the brain, occasionally causing [[confusion]].

ARDS mostly occurs about 72 hours after the trigger, such as an injury (trauma, burns, aspiration, massive blood transfusion, drug/alcohol abuse) or an acute illness (infectious pneumonia, sepsis, acute pancreatitis).

ARDS is characterized by:<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/><ref name=definition-ARDS />
* Acute onset
* Bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph sparing costophrenic angles
* [[Pulmonary artery wedge pressure]] < 18 mmHg (obtained by [[pulmonary artery catheter]]ization), if this information is available; if unavailable, then lack of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension
* if Pa{{chem|O|2}}:Fi{{chem|O|2}} < 300 mmHg (40 kPa) [[acute lung injury]] (ALI) is considered to be present
* if Pa{{chem|O|2}}:Fi{{chem|O|2}} < 200 mmHg (26.7 kPa) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is considered to be present

The Pa{{chem|O|2}}:Fi{{chem|O|2}} ratios above refer to the gradient between the inspired oxygen level and the oxygen that is present in the blood. The lower the ratio, the less inspired oxygen is getting into the blood, and so the worse the patient's condition — so ARDS represents a more severe progression of disease from ALI by these diagnostic criteria. 

To summarize and simplify, ARDS is an acute (rapid onset) syndrome (collection of symptoms) that affects the lungs widely and results in a severe oxygenation defect, but is not due to heart failure.

==Cause==
Three clinical settings account for 75% of ARDS cases:

1. [[Sepsis]] syndrome - most important cause

2. Severe multiple [[Physical trauma|trauma]]

3. Aspiration of saliva/gastric contents and it could also be a complication of pneumonia if left untreated known as [[aspiration pneumonia]].

Some cases of ARDS are linked to large volumes of fluid used during resuscitation post trauma.<ref name=EMB11>{{cite journal|last=Cherkas|first=David|title=Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock: Advances In Fluid Management|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|year=2011|month=Nov|volume=13|issue=11|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/store.php?paction=showProduct&catid=8&pid=244}}</ref> Other causes include shock, near-drowning, multiple transfusions and inhalation of irritants or toxic fumes that damage the alveolar epithelium.

==Diagnosis==

An [[arterial blood gas]] analysis and [[chest X-ray]] allow formal diagnosis by the below mentioned criteria. Although severe hypoxemia is generally included, the appropriate threshold defining abnormal Pa{{chem|O|2}} has never been systematically studied.  Note though, that a severe oxygenation defect is not synonymous with ventilatory support.  Any Pa{{chem|O|2}} below 100 (generally saturation less than 100%) on a supplemental oxygen fraction of 50% meets criteria for ARDS.  This can easily be achieved by high flow oxygen supplementation without ventilatory support.

Any cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema should be excluded. This can be done by placing a [[pulmonary artery catheter]] for measuring the pulmonary artery wedge pressure. However, this is not necessary and is now rarely done as abundant evidence has emerged demonstrating that the use of pulmonary artery catheters does not lead to improved patient outcomes in critical illness including ARDS.

Plain chest X-rays are sufficient to document bilateral alveolar infiltrates in the majority of cases. While CT scanning leads to more accurate images of the pulmonary parenchyma in ARDS, it has little utility in the clinical management of patients with ARDS, and remains largely a research tool.

Four main criteria for ARDS:
# Acute onset
# Chest X-Ray: Bilateral [[diffuse infiltrate]]s of the lungs
# No cardiovascular lesion
# No evidence of left atrial hypertension: [[Fraction of inspired oxygen#PaO2/FiO2 ratio|PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio]] equal to or less than 200 mmHg.

The criteria for diagnosis of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) are similar except that PaO2/FiO2 ratio is ≤300.

To assess the severity of ARDS, the [[Murray scoring system]] is used, which takes into account the chest X-ray, the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, the [[positive end-expiratory pressure]], and [[lung compliance]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Hyaline membranes - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of [[diffuse alveolar damage]], the histologic correlate of ARDS. [[H&E stain]].]]

ARDS is a clinical syndrome associated with a variety of pathological findings.  These include pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).  Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD.

DAD is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung parenchyma. The triggering insult to the parenchyma usually results in an initial release of [[cytokines]] and other inflammatory mediators, secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]].

[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung parenchyma and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. 

Typical histological presentation involves diffuse [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] damage and [[hyaline]] membrane formation in alveolar walls.

Although the triggering mechanisms are not completely understood, recent research has examined the role of inflammation and mechanical stress.

===Inflammation===
Inflammation alone, as in sepsis, causes endothelial dysfunction, fluid extravasation from the [[capillary|capillaries]] and impaired drainage of fluid from the lungs. Dysfunction of type II pulmonary epithelial cells may also be present, with a concomitant reduction in [[surfactant]] production. Elevated inspired oxygen concentration often becomes necessary at this stage, and may facilitate a '[[respiratory burst]]' in immune cells.

In a secondary phase, endothelial dysfunction causes cells and inflammatory exudate to enter the alveoli. This [[pulmonary edema]] increases the thickness of the alveolo-capillary space, increasing the distance the [[oxygen]] must diffuse to reach [[blood]]. This impairs gas exchange leading to hypoxia, increases the work of breathing, eventually induces [[fibrosis]] of the airspace.

Moreover, edema and decreased surfactant production by type II pneumocytes may cause whole [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] to collapse, or to completely flood. This ''loss of aeration'' contributes further to the [[right-to-left shunt]] in ARDS. As the alveoli contain progressively less gas, the blood flowing through the alveolar capillaries is progressively less oxygenated, resulting in massive intrapulmonary shunting.

Collapsed alveoli (and small [[bronchi]]) do not allow gas exchange. It is not uncommon to see patients with a Pa{{chem|O|2}} of 60 [[mmHg]] (8.0 [[kilopascal|kPa]]) despite mechanical ventilation with 100% inspired oxygen.

The loss of aeration may follow different patterns according to the nature of the underlying disease, and other factors. In pneumonia-induced ARDS, for example, large, more commonly causes relatively compact areas of alveolar infiltrates. These are usually distributed to the lower [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]], in their posterior segments, and they roughly correspond to the initial infected area.

In sepsis or trauma-induced ARDS, infiltrates are usually more patchy and diffuse. The posterior and basal segments are always more affected, but the distribution is even less homogeneous.

Loss of aeration also causes important changes in lung mechanical properties. These alterations are fundamental in the process of inflammation amplification and progression to ARDS in mechanically ventilated patients.

===Mechanical stress===
[[Mechanical ventilation]] is an essential part of the treatment of ARDS. As loss of aeration (and the underlying disease) progress, the end tidal volume eventually grows to a level incompatible with life. Thus, mechanical ventilation is initiated to relieve respiratory muscles of their work, and to protect the usually obtunded patient's [[airway]]s.

However, mechanical ventilation may constitute a risk factor for the development, or the worsening, of ARDS.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/>

Aside from the infectious complications arising from invasive ventilation with [[tracheal intubation]], positive-pressure ventilation directly alters lung mechanics during ARDS. The result is higher mortality, i.e. through baro-trauma, when these techniques are used.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/>

In 1998, Amato ''et al.'' published a paper showing substantial improvement in the outcome of patients ventilated with lower [[tidal volume]]s (''V''<sub>t</sub>) (6 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup>).<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/><ref name=Amato_1998>{{cite journal | author = Amato M, Barbas C, Medeiros D, Magaldi R, Schettino G, Lorenzi-Filho G, Kairalla R, Deheinzelin D, Munoz C, Oliveira R, Takagaki T, Carvalho C | title = Effect of a protective-ventilation strategy on mortality in the acute respiratory distress syndrome | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 338 | issue = 6 | pages = 347–54 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9449727 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199802053380602}}</ref> This result was confirmed in a 2000 study sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]].<ref name=MacIntyre_2000>{{cite journal | author = MacIntyre N | title = Mechanical ventilation strategies for lung protection | journal = Semin Respir Crit Care Med | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–22 | year = 2000 | pmid = 16088734 | doi = 10.1055/s-2000-9850}}</ref> Although both these studies were widely criticized for several reasons, and although the authors were not the first to experiment lower-volume ventilation, they shed new light on the relationship between mechanical ventilation and ARDS.

One opinion is that the forces applied to the lung by the [[ventilator]] may work as a lever to induce further damage to lung parenchyma. It appears that [[shear stress]] at the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between collapsed and aerated units may result in the breakdown of aerated units, which inflate asymmetrically due to the 'stickiness' of surrounding flooded alveoli. The fewer such interfaces around an alveolus, the lesser the stress.

Indeed, even relatively low stress forces may induce [[signal transduction]] systems at the cellular level, thus inducing the release of inflammatory mediators.

This form of stress is thought to be applied by the [[transpulmonary pressure]] ([[gradient]]) (''P''<sub>l</sub>) generated by the ventilator or, better, its cyclical variations. The better outcome obtained in patients ventilated with lower ''V''<sub>t</sub> may be interpreted as a beneficial effect of the lower ''P''<sub>l</sub>. Transpulmonary [[pressure]], is an indirect [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the ''V''<sub>t</sub> setting on the ventilator, and only trial patients with [[plateau pressure]]s (a surrogate for the actual ''P''<sub>l</sub>) were less than 32 [[centimetre of water|cm{{chem|H|2|O}}]] (3.1 [[kilopascal|kPa]]) had improved survival.

The way ''P''<sub>l</sub> is applied on alveolar surface determines the shear stress to which lung units are exposed. ARDS is characterized by a usually inhomogeneous reduction of the airspace, and thus by a tendency towards higher ''P''<sub>l</sub> at the same ''V''<sub>t</sub>, and towards ''higher'' stress on ''less'' diseased units.

The inhomogeneity of alveoli at different stages of disease is further increased by the gravitational gradient to which they are exposed, and the different [[perfusion pressure]]s at which blood flows through them. Finally, abdominal pressure exerts an additional pressure on inferoposterior lung segments, favoring compression and collapse of those units.

The different mechanical properties of alveoli in ARDS may be interpreted as having varying ''time constants'' (the product of alveolar [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] × [[pulmonary alveolus#details|resistance]]). A long time constant indicates an alveolus which opens slowly during tidal inflation, as a consequence of contrasting pressure around it, or altered water-air interface inside it (loss of surfactant, flooding).

Slow alveoli are said to be 'kept open' using [[mechanical ventilation|positive end-expiratory pressure]], a feature of modern ventilators which maintains a positive airway pressure throughout the whole respiratory cycle. A higher mean pressure cycle-wide slows the collapse of diseased units, but it has to be weighed against the corresponding elevation in ''P''<sub>l</sub>/plateau pressure. Newer ventilatory approaches attempt to maximize mean airway pressure for its ability to 'recruit' collapsed lung units while minimizing the shear stress caused by frequent openings and closings of aerated units.

The [[prone position]] also reduces the inhomogeneity in alveolar time constants induced by gravity and edema. If clinically appropriate, mobilization of the ventilated patient can assist in achieving the same goal.

===Stress Index===
[[File:StressIndex Comparison.png|thumb|Stress Index of an ARDS patient with different values of PEEP]]
Mechanical ventilation can exacerbate the inflammatory response in patients with ARDS by including cyclic tidal alveolar hyperinflation and/or recruiting/derecruiting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Slutsky AS |title=Ventilator-induced lung injury: from barotrauma to biotrauma |journal=Respir Care |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=646–59 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15912625 |url=http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/05.05/05.05.0646.pdf}}</ref>
Stress index is measured during constant-flow assist-control mechanical ventilation without changing the baseline ventilatory pattern. Identifying the steadiest portion of the inspiratory flow (F) waveform fit the corresponding portion of the airway pressure (Paw) waveform in the following power equation.

Paw = a × t<sup>b</sub> + c

where the coefficient b, the “Stress Index,” describes the shape of the curve. The Stress Index depict a constant compliance if the value is around 1, an increasing compliance during the inspiration if the value is below 1, and a decreasing compliance if the value is above 1. 

Ranieri, Grasso, et al. set a strategy guided by the stress index with the following rules:
*Stress Index below 0.9, PEEP was increased
*Stress Index between 0.9 and 1.1, no change was made
*Stress Index above 1.1 PEEP was decreased.
*Adjustment of PEEP was suspended if any one of the following conditions ensued: plateau pressure > 30&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}}, Sa{{chem|O|2}} < 88%, or hemodynamic instability.

Alveolar hyperinflation in patients with focal ARDS ventilated with the ARDSnet protocol is attenuated by a physiologic approach to PEEP setting based on the stress index measurement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grasso S, Stripoli T, De Michele M, ''et al.'' |title=ARDSnet ventilatory protocol and alveolar hyperinflation: role of positive end-expiratory pressure |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=176 |issue=8 |pages=761–7 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17656676 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200702-193OC |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17656676}}</ref>

===Progression===
If the underlying disease or injurious factor is not removed, the amount of inflammatory mediators released by the lungs in ARDS may result in a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (or [[sepsis]] if there is lung infection).<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/> The evolution towards [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and/or [[multiple organ failure]] follows paths analogous to the pathophysiology of sepsis.

This adds up to the impaired oxygenation which is the central problem of ARDS, as well as to [[respiratory acidosis]], which is often caused by ventilation techniques such as [[permissive hypercapnia]] which attempt to limit ventilator-induced lung injury in ARDS.

The result is a critical illness in which the 'endothelial disease' of severe sepsis/[[SIRS]] is worsened by the pulmonary dysfunction, which further impairs oxygen delivery.

==Treatment==
Acute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the [[intensive care|Intensive Care Unit]]. Ventilation is usually delivered through oro-tracheal [[intubation]], or [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] whenever prolonged ventilation (≥2 weeks) is deemed inevitable.

The possibilities of [[non-invasive ventilation]] are limited to the very early period of the disease or, better, to  prevention in individuals at risk for the development of the disease ([[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion]], major surgery patients).

Treatment of the underlying cause is imperative, as it tends to maintain the ARDS picture.

Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy must be administered as soon as [[microbiological culture]] results are available. [[Empirical]] therapy ''may'' be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. More than 60% ARDS patients experience a ([[nosocomial]]) pulmonary infection either before or after the onset of lung injury.

The origin of [[infection]], when surgically treatable, must be operated on. When [[sepsis]] is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] should be enacted.

Commonly used supportive therapy includes particular techniques of mechanical ventilation and pharmacological agents whose effectiveness with respect to the outcome has not yet been proven. It is now debated whether mechanical ventilation is to be considered mere supportive therapy or actual treatment, since it may substantially affect survival.

Survivors of ARDS have an increased risk of lower quality of life, persistent cognitive impairment, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.

===Mechanical ventilation===
{{ Further2|[[Pressure Regulated Volume Control]] }}
The overall goal is to maintain acceptable gas exchange and to minimize adverse effects in its application. Three parameters are used: PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to maintain maximal recruitment of alveolar units), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and plateau pressure (best predictor of alveolar overdistention).<ref>{{cite journal | author =Malhotra A | title = Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome | journal =  N Engl J Med | volume = 357 | issue = 11 | pages = 1113–20| year = 2007 | pmid = 17855672  | doi =10.1056/NEJMct074213 | pmc =2287190}}</ref>

Conventional therapy aimed at [[tidal volume]]s (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12–15 ml/kg. Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or [http://www.ardsnet.org/index.php ARDSNet], completed a landmark trial that showed improved [[Mortality rate|mortality]] when ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause [[permissive hypercapnia|hypercapnia]] and [[atelectasis]]<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/> due to their inherent tendency to increase physiologic shunt. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion.  A shunt is perfusion without ventilation. 

Low tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS.  Plateau pressure less than 30&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSnet trial (as well as other experimental data) demonstrate that there appears to be NO safe upper limit to plateau pressure; that is, regardless of plateau pressure, patients fare better with low tidal volumes (see Hager et al., American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 2005).

=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===

It is often said that no particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in [[airway pressure release ventilation]] (APRV).  The ARDSNet trial<ref>[http://www.ardsnet.org/index.php ARDSNet]</ref> used a volume controlled mode comparing delivered tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg with 12 ml/kg and showed decrease mortality with smaller volumes and typically higher set rates.  However, other modes of ventilation, like airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), have not been directly compared to volume controlled ventilation*.

Some [[respiratory therapist|practitioners]] favor [[airway pressure release ventilation]] when treating ARDS.  Well documented advantages to APRV ventilation<ref>[http://medschool.umaryland.edu/surgery/general/resident/website/docs/articles/critical_care/Pulmonary/APRV%20Theory%20and%20Practice.pdf APRV]</ref> include: decreased airway pressures, decreased minute ventilation, decreased dead-space ventilation, promotion of spontaneous breathing, almost 24 hour a day alveolar recruitment, decreased use of sedation, near elimination of neuromuscular blockade, optimized arterial blood gas results, mechanical restoration of FRC (functional residual capacity), a positive effect on cardiac output<ref>[http://ccforum.com/content/5/4/221 a positive effect on cardiac output]</ref> (due to the negative inflection from the elevated baseline with each spontaneous breath), increased organ and tissue perfusion and potential for increased urine output secondary to increased renal perfusion.

A patient with ARDS, on average, spends between 8 and 11 days on a mechanical ventilator; APRV may reduce this time significantly and conserve valuable resources.  

* A proposed study to compare APRV to the ARDSNet Protocol is set for December 2011.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00793013 Comparison study APRV to ARDSNet]</ref>

* January 2013 - Animal studies show that ventilation with APRV immediately following injury prevents development of ARDS, when compared to current published ARDS Network guidelines (6 mL/kg).<ref>http://journals.lww.com/shockjournal/Abstract/2013/01000/Early_Airway_Pressure_Release_Ventilation_Prevents.5.aspx</ref>

=== Positive end-expiratory pressure ===
[[Positive end-expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) is used in mechanically-ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation.  In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be "recruited" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable aveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some or perhaps most alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open.  Hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level.  Finally, PEEP can be harmful.  High PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure.  This in turn can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD.

The 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli, and more importantly the overdistension of aerated units, occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some of the newest ventilators have the ability to automatically plot a pressure-volume curve. The possibility of having an 'instantaneous' tracing trigger might produce renewed interest in this analysis.

PEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver' (i.e., a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa), to recruit, or open, collapsed units with a high distending pressure) before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} (or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]]) during a step-down trial.

[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP), or auto-PEEP, first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital, is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in patients.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in patients with obstructive lung disease.  iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS patients, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of ARDS patients, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].

A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.

=== Prone position ===
Distribution of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform. Repositioning into the prone position (face down) might improve oxygenation by relieving [[atelectasis]] and improving perfusion. However, although the hypoxemia is overcome there seems to be no effect on overall survival.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS /><ref name=Prone-ARDS>{{cite journal | author = Gattinoni L, Tognoni G, Pesenti A, Taccone P, Mascheroni D, Labarta V, Malacrida R, Di Giulio P, Fumagalli R, Pelosi P, Brazzi L, Latini R | title = Effect of prone positioning on the survival of patients with acute respiratory failure | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 345 | issue = 8 | pages = 568–73 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11529210 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa010043}}</ref>

=== Fluid management ===
Several studies have shown that pulmonary function and outcome are better in patients that lost weight or [[pulmonary wedge pressure]] was lowered by [[:wikt:diuresis|diuresis]] or fluid restriction.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS />

=== Corticosteroids ===
A Meduri et al. study has found significant improvement in ARDS using modest doses of corticosteroids.The initial regimen consists of [[methylprednisolone]] 2&nbsp;mg/kg daily. After 3–5 days a response must be apparent. In 1–2 weeks the dose can be tapered to methylprednisolone 0.5–1.0&nbsp;mg daily. But  high dose steroid therapy has no effect on ARDS when given within 24 hours of the onset of illness.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS /><ref name=Meduri-ARDS>{{cite journal | author = Meduri G, Tolley E, Chrousos G, Stentz F | title = Prolonged methylprednisolone treatment suppresses systemic inflammation in patients with unresolving acute respiratory distress syndrome: evidence for inadequate endogenous glucocorticoid secretion and inflammation-induced immune cell resistance to glucocorticoids | journal = Am J Respir Crit Care Med | volume = 165 | issue = 7 | pages = 983–91 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11934726}}</ref>  This was a study involving a small number of patients in one center.  A recent NIH-sponsored multicenter ARDSnet LAZARUS study of corticosteroids for ARDS demonstrated that they are not efficacious in ARDS. The benefit of steroids in late ARDS may be explained by the ability of steroids to promote breakdown and inhibit fibrosis.

=== Nitric oxide ===
Inhaled [[nitric oxide]] (NO) potentially acts as selective pulmonary vasodilator. Rapid binding to [[hemoglobin]] prevents systemic effects. It should increase perfusion of better ventilated areas. There are no large studies demonstrating positive results. Therefore its use must be considered individually.

[[Almitrine bismesylate]] stimulates chemoreceptors in carotic and aortic bodies. It has been used to potentiate the effect of NO, presumably by potentiating hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. In case of ARDS it is not known whether this combination is useful.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS />

=== Surfactant therapy ===
To date no prospective [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled clinical trial]] has shown a significant mortality benefit of exogenous surfactant in adult ARDS.<ref name = Rippe-ARDS />

==Complications==
Since ARDS is an extremely serious condition which requires invasive forms of therapy it is not without risk. Complications to be considered are:<ref name = Rippe-ARDS />
*Pulmonary: [[barotrauma]] (volutrauma), [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE), pulmonary fibrosis, [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]] (VAP).
*Gastrointestinal: hemorrhage (ulcer), dysmotility, pneumoperitoneum, bacterial translocation.
*Cardiac: arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction.
*Renal: [[acute renal failure]] (ARF), positive fluid balance.
*Mechanical: vascular injury, pneumothorax (by placing pulmonary artery catheter), tracheal injury/stenosis (result of intubation and/or irritation by endotracheal tube.
*Nutritional: malnutrition (catabolic state), electrolyte deficiency.

==Epidemiology==
The annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of ARDS is 13–23 people per 100,000 in the general population.<ref>Lewandowski K, Lewandowski M. Epidemiology of ARDS. Minerva Anestesiol. 2006 Jun;72(6):473-7.</ref> Its incidence in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU), [[mechanical ventilation|mechanically ventilated]] population is much higher. Brun-Buisson ''et al.'' (2004) reported a prevalence of acute lung injury (ALI) (see below) of 16.1% percent in ventilated patients admitted for more than 4 hours. More than half these patients may develop ARDS.

Elevated abdominal pressure of any cause is also probably a risk factor for the development of ARDS, particularly during mechanical ventilation.

==History==
Acute respiratory distress syndrome was first described in 1967 by Ashbaugh ''et al.''<ref name=Rippe-ARDS>{{cite book | author = Irwin RS, Rippe JM | title = Irwin and Rippe's Intensive Care Medicine | edition = 5th | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-7817-3548-3 }}</ref><ref name=Ashbaugh-ARDS>{{cite journal | author = Ashbaugh D, Bigelow D, Petty T, Levine B | title = Acute respiratory distress in adults | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 |issue = 7511 | pages = 319–23 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4143721 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(67)90168-7}}</ref> Initially there was no definition, resulting in controversy over [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] and [[death|mortality]]. In 1988 an expanded definition was proposed which quantified physiologic respiratory impairment.

In 1994 a new definition was recommended by the American-European Consensus Conference Committee.<ref name=Rippe-ARDS/><ref name=definition-ARDS>{{cite journal | author = Bernard G, Artigas A, Brigham K, Carlet J, Falke K, Hudson L, Lamy M, Legall J, Morris A, Spragg R | title = The American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS.

ARDS was defined as the ratio of arterial partial oxygen tension (Pa{{chem|O|2}}) as fraction of inspired oxygen [[FiO2|(Fi{{chem|O|2}})]] below 200 mmHg in the presence of bilateral[[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]]s on the  chest x-ray. These infiltrates may appear similar to those of left ventricular failure, but the cardiac silhouette appears normal in ARDS. Also, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is normal (less than 18 mmHg) in ARDS, but raised in left ventricular failure.

A Pa{{chem|O|2}}/Fi{{chem|O|2}} ratio less than 300 mmHg with bilateral infiltrates indicates[[acute lung injury]] (ALI). Although formally considered different from ARDS, ALI is usually just a precursor to ARDS.

In 2012 the Berlin Definition of ARDS was published. This did away with the ALI/ARDS differentiation. It opts instead to classify ARDS as mild, moderate or severe.<ref name=Berlin-ARDS>{{cite journal | author = CV. Marco Ranieri, MD  | title = The ARDS Definition Task Force*.
