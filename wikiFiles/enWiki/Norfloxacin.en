The licensed uses for norfloxacin are quite limited as norfloxacin is to be considered a drug of last resort when all other antibiotics have failed. There are currently only three approved uses in the adult population<ref name=fda08>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/019384s052lbl.pdf |title=TABLETS NOROXIN (NORFLOXACIN) |author=Merck Sharp & Dohme |authorlink=Merck & Co. |month=September |year=2008 |publisher=FDA |location=USA |format=PDF }}</ref> (one of which is restricted<ref name=docguide/>) and the other ineffective due to bacterial resistance.

Norfloxacin interacts with a number of other drugs, as well as a number of herbal and natural supplements. Such interactions increase the risk of [[anticoagulation]] and the formation of non-absorbable complexes, as well as increasing the risk of toxicity.<ref name=DB01059>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01059 |title=Showing drug card for Norfloxacin (DB01059) |coauthors= |date=19 February |publisher=DrugBank.ca |location=Canada }}</ref>

Norfloxacin is associated with a number of serious and life threatening adverse reactions as well as spontaneous [[tendon ruptures]] and irreversible [[peripheral neuropathy]]. Such reactions may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities. [[Hepatoxicity]] resulting in fatalities has also been reported with the use of norfloxacin.

==History==
Since its establishment in 1946, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) has been and currently is involved in the development of synthetic antibacterial agents from nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, leading to new quinolones.<ref>http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200109/000020010901A0173889.php</ref>  Subsequent work led to the birth of a new era with the introduction of norfloxacin as the first new quinolone in Japan in 1984 and then in many other countries throughout the world. Since the discovery of norfloxacin (1980), around 10,000 new analogues have been described.<ref>http://www.baytril.com/index.php/fuseaction/download/lrn_file/baytril-history_090112.pdf</ref>

Norfloxacin was first patented in 1979.<ref>http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/term/certs/4146719.pdf</ref> Kyorin granted Merck & Company, Inc., an exclusive license (in certain countries, including the United States), to import and distribute Norfloxacin under the brand name Noroxin. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Noroxin for distribution in the United States on October 31, 1986.  Since the approval of Noroxin in 1986, there have been numerous upgrades to the warning sections of the package inserts, as well as recent restrictions placed upon the use of Noroxin to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs).<ref name=docguide/>

==Licensed uses==
In the adult population Oral and I.V. Norfloxacin is limited to the treatment of proven bacterial infections. The initial approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1986 encompassed the following indications:

*Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (including cystitis)

*Complicated urinary tract infections (restricted use) <ref name=docguide/>

*Uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea (''however this indication is no longer considered to be effective by some experts due to bacterial resistance'') <ref>http://prod.hopkins-abxguide.org/literature_review/09-2007/update_to_cdc_s_sexually_transmitted_diseases_treatment.html?contentInstanceId=254789&siteId=153</ref><ref name="nycms.org">{{cite web |author=Susan Blank |coauthors=Julia Schillinger |title=DOHMH ALERT #8:Fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea, NYC |url=http://www.nycms.org/article_view.php3?view=947&part=1 |publisher=New York County Medical Society |location=USA |date=14 May 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

*Prostatitis due to ''Escherichia coli''.

*Syphilis treatment: Norfloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis.

Though the fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat [[typhoid]] and [[paratyphoid fever]], it should be noted here that norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Effa EE, Lassi ZS, Critchley JA, ''et al.'' |title=Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=10 |pages=CD004530 |year=2011 |pmid=21975746 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004530.pub4 |editor1-last=Bhutta |editor1-first=Zulfiqar A}}</ref>

In ophthalmology, Norfloxacin licensed use is limited to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov"/>

Norfloxacin has been restricted in the [[Republic of Ireland]] due to the risks of ''[[Clostridium difficile|C.&nbsp;difficile]]'' super infections and permanent nerve as well as tendon injuries. It licensed use in acute and chronic complicated kidney infections has been withdrawn as a result.<ref name=wottooa>{{cite web |author=Clodagh Sheehy |title=Warning over two types of antibiotic |url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/warning-over-two-types-of-antibiotic-1445498.html |location=Republic of Ireland |date=2 August 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

The [[European Medicines Agency]], also in 2008, had recommended restricting the use of oral norfloxacin to treat urinary infections. CHMP had concluded that the marketing authorizations for norfloxacin, when used in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis, should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. CHMP stated that doctors should not prescribe oral norfloxacin for complicated pyelonephritis and should consider switching patients already taking oral norfloxacin for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.<ref name=docguide>{{Cite web |url=http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF68525749000687709 |title=EMEA Restricts Use of Oral Norfloxacin Drugs in UTIs |publisher=DGNews |location=UK |date=24 July 2008 }}</ref>

Note: Norfloxacin may be licensed for other uses, or restricted, by the various regulatory agencies worldwide.

==Availability==
Norfloxacin is available as:

* tablets 400-mg
* eye drops

In most countries, all formulations require a prescription. In Colombia (South America) it is marketed under '''Ambigram''' from Laboratorios Bussié

==Mode of action==
Norfloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=1 September 1997|pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 }}</ref> enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

This mechanism can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family (for example those that contain the C-8 fluorine),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robinson MJ, Martin BA, Gootz TD, McGuirk PR, Osheroff N |title=Effects of novel fluoroquinolones on the catalytic activities of eukaryotic topoisomerase II: Influence of the C-8 fluorine group |journal=Antimicrob.

==Contraindications==
As noted above, under licensed use, norfloxacin is also now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.<ref name="nycms.org"/>

Norfloxacin is contraindicated in those with a history of tendonitis, tendon rupture and those with a hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/pre96/019384_S027_NOROXIN.pdf |title=19-384/S027 |publisher=FDA |location=USA |format=PDF |year=1995 |unused_data=Center for drug evaluation and research }}</ref> 

There are three contraindications found within the 2008 package<ref name=fda08/> insert:

*”Noroxin (norfloxacin) is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, or tendon rupture associated with the use of norfloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents.”

*”Quinolones, including norfloxacin, have been shown in vitro to inhibit CYP1A2. Concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. Patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with norfloxacin should be carefully monitored.”

*“Concomitant administration with [[tizanidine]] is contraindicated”

Norfloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population.

*'''Pregnancy'''
Norfloxacin has been reported to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues.<ref>http://drugsafetysite.com/norfloxacin/ referencing: T.P. Dowling, personal communication, Merck & Co, Inc., 1987</ref> For this reason norfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother’s milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shin HC, Kim JC, Chung MK, ''et al.'' |title=Fetal and maternal tissue distribution of the new fluoroquinolone DW-116 in pregnant rats |journal=Comp.

*'''Pediatric population'''
A 1998 retrospective survey found that that numerous side effects have been recorded in reference to the unapproved use of norfloxacin in the pediatric population.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pariente-Khayat | first1 = A. | last2 = Vauzelle-Kervroedan | first2 = F. | last3 = d'Athis | first3 = P. | last4 = Bréart | first4 = G. | last5 = Gendrel | first5 = D. | last6 = Aujard | first6 = Y. | last7 = Olive | first7 = G. | last8 = Pons | first8 = G. | title = [Retrospective survey of fluoroquinolone use in children] | journal = Arch Pediatr | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 484–8 | month = May | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1016/S0929-693X(99)80311-X | pmid = 9759180 }}</ref>

By August 1996, the FDA had not taken action, and the consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] filed a petition with the FDA prompting the agency to act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Petition to Require a Warning on All Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics (HRG Publication #1399) |date=August 1, 1996 |publisher=[[Public Citizen]] |url=http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=6595}} Retrieved on December 27, 2008.</ref> Two months later, the FDA published an alert in the ''FDA Medical Bulletin'' and requested that fluoroquinolone package inserts be amended to include information on this risk.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reports of adverse events with fluoroquinolones |journal=FDA Medical Bulletin |date=October 1996 |volume=26 |issue=3 |url=http://www.fda.gov/medbull/oct96/adverse.html }} {{Dead link|date=June 2009}} Retrieved on December 27, 2008. alternate link: http://www.fqresearch.org/text_documents/FDA_Medical_Bulletin_1996.doc</ref>

===Regulatory actions===
There has been a significant number of regulatory actions taken as a result of such adverse reactions, which included published warnings,<ref>{{cite web |author=U S Food and Drug Administration |authorlink=US Food and Drug Administration |title=FDA Requests Boxed Warnings on Fluoroquinolone Antimicrobial Drugs |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116919.htm |publisher=FDA |location=USA |format=PDF |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=US Food and Drug Administration |authorlink=US Food and Drug Administration |title=Fluoroquinolone Antimicrobial Drugs [ciprofloxacin (marketed as Cipro and generic ciprofloxacin), ciprofloxacin extended release (marketed as Cipro XR and Proquin XR), gemifloxacin (marketed as Factive), levofloxacin (marketed as Levaquin), moxifloxacin (marketed as Avelox), norfloxacin (marketed as Noroxin), and ofloxacin (marketed as Floxin and generic ofloxacin)] |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm084316.htm |publisher= |location=USA |year=2008 |accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref> additional warnings and safety information added to the package inserts<ref>{{cite web |author=US Food and Drug Administration |authorlink=US Food and Drug Administration |title=Drugs at FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory#apphist |publisher=FDA |location=USA |accessdate=5 September 2009}} Noroxin as the search term</ref> together with the request for the issuance of "Dear Doctor Letters" concerning the recent addition of Black Box Warnings in 2008.
Although requested to do so by the FDA back in 2008, the manufacturers of Noroxin have not issued any "Dear Doctor Letters" regarding the tendon issues as of September 2009. Fifteen years ago, in 1994, the manufacturers had added minimal warnings concerning the association with norfloxacin and musculoskeletal tendinitis as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures. This change was approved by the FDA on July 1, 1994 and included minimal warnings regarding ruptures, as well as [[pseudomembranous colitis]].<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/pre96/019384_S024_NOROXIN.pdf</ref>  The tendon warnings were once again revised in 1996 as the previous warnings concerning tendon issues were considered by the FDA to be inadequate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/96/019384_S029_NOROXIN.pdf |title=Approval package application number: 19-384 |publisher=FDA |location=USA |language=USA |format=PDF |year=1996 }}</ref>

In 2004 the FDA requested new warning labels to be added to all of the Fluoroquinolones, including norfloxacin, regarding Peripheral Neuropathy (irreversible nerve damage), Tendon Damage, Heart Problems (prolonged QT Interval / Torsades de pointes), Pseudomembranous colitis, Rhabdomyolysis (muscle wasting), Steven Johnson Syndrome, as well as concurrent usage of NSAIDs contributing to the severity of these reactions.<ref name=fda06/> The package insert was not changed to include any warnings regarding Steven Johnson Syndrome until September, 2008, four years later.  In 1994 the product information for norfloxacin was amended in Japan (October 1994), to state that [[rhabdomyolysis]] may occur.<ref>(JPNARD) Information on Adverse Reactions to Drugs, No.128, (Oct 1994)</ref> A number of case reports concerning this had also been published as early as 1992.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kubo-Shimasaki | first1 = A. | last2 = Yoshimoto | first2 = K. | last3 = Tatsumi | first3 = E. | last4 = Yoneda | first4 = N. | last5 = Yamaguchi | first5 = N. | title = [Norfloxacin-induced infectious mononucleosis (IM)-like syndrome with Stevens-Johnson syndrome] | journal = Rinsho Ketsueki | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–8 | month= June| year = 1992 | doi =  | pmid = 1433924 }}</ref> This has also been reported again within the literature in 1996.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Blain | first1 = H. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | last3 = Weryha | first3 = G. | last4 = Tréchot | first4 = P. | last5 = Hanesse | first5 = B. | last6 = Leclère | first6 = J. | title = [Rhabdomyolysis and unexplained malaise.

On September 23, 2008, the FDA required the manufacturer to add an additional warning to the package inserts that stated that “Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including Noroxin.”<ref name=fda08al/>

==Interactions==

The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the [[cytochrome P450]] system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin [[warfarin]] activity; INR should be monitored closely.
<ref name=fda06>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2006/019384s046LTR.pdf</ref>

They may also interact with the [[GABA A receptor]] and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brouwers JR |title=Drug interactions with quinolone antibacterials |journal=Drug Saf |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=268–81 |year=1992 |pmid=1524699 |doi=10.2165/00002018-199207040-00003 |month= July|first1=JR |issn=0114-5916 }}</ref> 
The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a quinolone, including norfloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Therefore, norfloxacin should be used with caution in individuals receiving NSAIDS concomitantly.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2006/019384s045LTR.pdf</ref>

Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with norfloxacin. Therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.

The concomitant administration of quinolones including norfloxacin with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.

===Significant drug interactions===

Some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janknegt R |title=Drug interactions with quinolones |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=26 Suppl D |issue= |pages=7–29 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2286594 |doi= |url= |first1=R |issn=0305-7453}}</ref>

Such drug interactions are associated with the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving [[NSAIDS]] and [[theophylline]].  As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect.  The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harder S, Fuhr U, Staib AH, Wolff T |title=Ciprofloxacin-caffeine: a drug interaction established using in vivo and in vitro investigations |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=87 |issue=5A |pages=89S–91S |year=1989 |month=November |pmid=2589393 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90031-4|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+58-08-2 |first1=S |first2=U |first3=AH |first4=T |issn=0002-9343 |format=Free full text}}</ref> and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose.  This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.
<ref name=fda06/>

The use of NSAIDs (Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contra-indicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of GABA neurotransmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Domagala JM |title=Structure-activity and structure-side-effect relationships for the quinolone antibacterials |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=685–706 |year=1994 |month=April |pmid=8056688 |doi= 10.1093/jac/33.4.685|url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/4/685 |first1=JM |issn=0305-7453}}</ref>

The use of norfloxacin concomitantly has also been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate toxic reactions. 

Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Linden PD, Sturkenboom MC, Herings RM, Leufkens HM, Rowlands S, Stricker BH |title=Increased risk of achilles tendon rupture with quinolone antibacterial use, especially in elderly patients taking oral corticosteroids |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=163 |issue=15 |pages=1801–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12912715 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.15.1801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/15/1801 |month= August|first1=PD |first2=MC |first3=RM |first4=HM |first5=S |first6=BH |issn=0003-9926}}</ref>

==Overdose==

Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach via induced vomiting or by [[gastric lavage]]. Careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. Administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of norfloxacin.<ref name=fda08/>

==Chemistry==

"Norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is a 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C16H18FN3O3.  Norfloxacin is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 319.34 and a melting point of about 221°C. It is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid, and very slightly soluble in ethanol, methanol and water.  Norfloxacin differs from non-fluorinated quinolones by having a fluorine atom at the 6 position and a piperazine moiety at the 7 position."  Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.<ref name=fda08/>

==Pharmacokinetics==

“Absorption of norfloxacin is rapid following single doses of 200&nbsp;mg, 400&nbsp;mg and 800&nbsp;mg. At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained within two days of dosing.  Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion as evidenced by the high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose.  Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value. The serum protein binding of norfloxacin is between 10 and 15%.” Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.<ref name=fda08/>

Biotransformation is via the liver and kidneys, with a half-life of 3–4 hours.<ref name=DB01059/>

==Dosing==

The status of the patient’s renal function and hepatic function should also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Norfloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.  However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver and the intestine. Modification of the dosage is ''recommended'' using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function.  ''(Particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction.)'' However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.  Additional caution is warranted in the elderly population as well.  The duration of treatment depends upon the ''severity'' of infection and the usual duration is anywhere from 3 to 28 days.<ref name=fda08/>

== Susceptible bacteria==

Gram-positive aerobes:

*''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]''
*''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''
*''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]''
*''[[Staphylococcus saprophyticus]]''
*''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]''

Gram-negative aerobes:

*''[[Citrobacter]] freundii''
*''[[Enterobacter aerogenes]]''
*''[[Enterobacter cloacae]]''
*''[[Escherichia coli]]''
*''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]''
*''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''
*''[[Proteus mirabilis]]''
*''[[Proteus vulgaris]]''
*''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''
*''[[Serratia marcescens]]''

As with other drugs in this class, some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with Norfloxacin.
