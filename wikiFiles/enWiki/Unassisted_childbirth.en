'''Unassisted childbirth''' (UC) refers to the process of intentionally giving [[birth]] without the assistance of a [[medical]] or professional [[birth attendant]].<ref name=bornfree>[http://www.unassistedchildbirth.com/uc/whatisuc.html  Bornfree! - What is Unassisted Childbirth?]</ref> It is also known as '''freebirth''', '''DIY''' (do-it-yourself) '''birth''',<ref name="Do-It-Yourself Delivery">{{cite news| last = Boodman| first = Sandra G.| title = Do-It-Yourself Delivery| pages = HE01| publisher = [[The Washington Post]]| date = 31 Jul 2007| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072702164.html| accessdate = 15 Apr 2009}}</ref> '''unhindered birth''', '''unassisted home birth''', and '''couples birth'''.

Unassisted childbirth is by definition a planned process, and is thus distinct from unassisted birth due to reasons of emergency, lack of access to a skilled birth attendant, or other. It is also different from [[homebirth]]: while most UCs ''do'' happen within the home, planned homebirth usually includes the presence of a [[midwife]] or other birth attendant.

==History==
The UC movement grew out of, and is an extension of the [[natural childbirth]] movement, pioneers of which include [[Grantly Dick-Read]], [[Robert A. Bradley]], and [[Fernand Lamaze]]. Influential proponents of UC include [[Marilyn A. Moran]], [[Jeannine Parvati Baker]], and [[Laura K. Shanley]].

Moran, who wrote several books advocating UC, was motivated primarily by a strong belief that childbirth is a private, deeply sexual experience that should be shared only between intimates. This belief led her in 1972, after nine conventional births, to give birth to her tenth and final child with only her husband in attendance at their home.<ref name="Moran">{{cite web| last =  Moran| first =  Marilyn A| title = Books and Newsletters about VBACs, Unassisted Birth and Pleasurable Husband/Wife Childbirth| publisher = gentlebirth.org| date = | url = http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/plesbrth.html| accessdate = 28 Apr 2009}}</ref>

Parvati Baker, a [[yogini]], writer, poet, [[herbalist]], and "spiritual midwife", coined the term ''freebirth'' to describe UC. Following the birth of her own children, she began to advocate for UC, speaking at conferences, giving interviews in various media, and writing extensively on the subject.<ref name="JPB Biography">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Jeannine Parvati Baker's Biography| publisher = Birthkeeper.com| date = | url = http://www.birthkeeper.com/Biography.html| accessdate = 28 Apr 2009}}</ref> Parvati Baker credits Moran for persuading her to practice and promote unassisted childbirth: "I was a young mother when Marilyn Moran wrote to me thirty years ago. Characteristically, she got right to the point. She told me that my work to promote midwifery was missing the boat. She had a better idea. Her letter changed my life. I had my next three babies without the paid paranoid in attendance, and expanded my own book, ''Prenatal Yoga and Natural Birth'', to include these freebirth stories."<ref name="PB_Review">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Our babies have only one birth (Parvati Baker's Amazon.com review of Moran's book ''Pleasurable Childbirth'')| publisher = | date = | url = http://www.amazon.com/Pleasurable-Husband-Wife-Childbirth-Consummation/product-reviews/0940128055/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1| accessdate = 4 Feb 2011}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=February 2011}}

Shanley, a writer, poet, and self-styled birth consultant, is the author of the book ''Unassisted Childbirth'' (1993), which helped popularize the practice. Inspired by the writings of Dick-Read, Shanley, who has no formal training in gynecology or obstetrics,<ref name="Baby's Day Out"/> gave birth to all five of her own children unassisted and with no prenatal care.<ref name="Giving Birth the Old Way">{{cite web| last = Grayson| first = Charlotte| title = Giving Birth the Old Way| publisher = WebMD Inc.| date = 15 Apr 2002| url = http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51649| accessdate = 21 Apr 2009}}</ref> Four of them survived; Shanley's fourth child, born four weeks [[Preterm birth|premature]] in her bathroom, died a few hours later of a [[heart defect]], [[pneumonia]], and [[sepsis]].<ref name="Do-It-Yourself Delivery"/>

In response to the recent growth in interest over unassisted childbirth, several national medical societies, including the [[Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada]],<ref name="Canadian doctors warn">{{Cite news| author-link = CTV.ca News Staff| title = Canadian doctors warn against 'freebirthing'| newspaper = CTV.ca| year = 2007| date = 21 Jun 2007| url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070621/freebirth_070621?s_name=Autos&no_ads=}}</ref> the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]],<ref name="Baby's Day Out">{{cite news| last = Jacang Maher| first = Jared| coauthors =| title = Baby's Day Out| publisher = Denver Westward News| date = 8 May 2007| url = http://www.westword.com/2007-05-10/news/baby-s-day-out/print| accessdate = }}</ref> and the [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]],<ref name="DIY birthing">{{cite news| last = Davies| first = Hannah| title = DIY birthing| publisher = Courier-Mail| date = 3 Jun 2007| url = http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21838181-5003426,00.html| accessdate = }}</ref> have issued strongly worded public statements warning against the practice. Professional midwives' associations, including the [[Royal College of Midwives]]<ref name="Midwives warn">{{cite news| last = Press Association|title = Midwives warn against 'freebirths'| publisher = Yell.com| date =| url = http://www.yell.com/health/information/midwives-warn-against-%27freebirths%27?location=Ballymoney,%20County%20Antrim&broaderLocation=| accessdate = 19 Apr 2009}}</ref> and the [[American College of Nurse-Midwives]]<ref name="Do-It-Yourself Delivery"/> also caution against UC.

==Common reasons and motivations==
Reasons and motivations for choosing to give birth unassisted range greatly from mother to mother; those most frequently cited in unassisted childbirth literature and advocacy sites include{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} the belief that birth is a normal function of the female body and therefore not a medical emergency.<ref name='GuardianBennett'>{{cite web| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/apr/05/comment.health1| title = While women in the developing world are dying in childbirth, why are we fetishising doing it at home?| publisher = [[The Guardian]]| last = Bennett| first = Catherine| accessdate = 2009-07-10| date = 2007-04-05}}</ref> Other beliefs are that most interventions commonly used by the medical profession during birth cause more harm than good in a normal birth, that the mother will be more apt to follow the natural flow of her individual birth in an undisturbed birth setting, thus enabling her to find the optimum positions or techniques to birth her child safely and the view that birth is an intimate, sexual, and potentially orgasmic experience,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.orgasmicbirth.com
| title = Medical information and resources for orgasmic birth | accessdate = 2009-07-10 }}</ref> and the belief that privacy is essential for enabling this erotic dimension.

Advocates believe that unassisted birth gives rise to a significant increase in maternal feelings and the mother's ability to [[maternal bond|bond]] with and take responsibility for the welfare of her child. Some followers are unable to find a birth practitioner willing to attend their desired home birth. In many areas of the United States, there are no midwives or physicians available to assist at home births. Likewise, the woman may find her specific case presents difficulty in finding a willing practitioner, as is usually the case with a [[vaginal birth after caesarean]] section.

== Types==
'''Unassisted with friends and/or family''':
While unassisted childbirth does not include the use of medical personnel or birth attendants in a professional capacity, the birthing woman may still wish to have other people present at her birth. This might include her partner, close friends of the mother, the grandparents-to-be, or other family members. These people may take on various roles such as minding the other children in the family, preparing food, making sure the mother remains undisturbed by phone calls, etc.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

'''Couple's Birth''':
A woman giving birth and her partner may wish to be alone together for the birth of their child. Some couples who choose unassisted childbirth consider the birth to be a consummation or extension of their married life.<ref>[http://www.unassistedhomebirth.com/conferencetapes.html Birth and the Dialogue of Love by Marilyn Moran]</ref> In terms of wanting to have an ecstatic or orgasmic birth, a high degree of privacy is desired. Others may simply consider birth to be an intimate bonding time between the spouses and their newborn child.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

'''Solo Birth''':
Some women choose to give birth completely alone. They may retreat to a room alone at the time of the birth and then bring their partner in afterward; or they may remain entirely alone in their home or another location. Women who choose a solo unassisted birth may see birthing as an intensely private process, or may feel they have all the resources they need through their intuition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Birth preparation and prenatal care ==
With respect to medical prenatal care, two broad categories are recognized by unassisted childbirth proponents:

'''Assisted''': Many women who are planning an unassisted birth choose to have professional prenatal care as part of their birth preparation. This may include regular prenatal visits with a doctor or monitoring by a midwife. Seeking the assistance of a [[Physician|doctor]] or [[midwife]] may allow for discovering risk factors that might make an unassisted birth inadvisable, such as [[placenta praevia]]. Professional prenatal care may also help identify risk factors that could be managed so that the unassisted birth can continue as planned. Rather than keep to a traditional prenatal care schedule, some women may also selectively choose prenatal care.

'''Unassisted''': Some women who choose UC also choose to have a medically unassisted pregnancy; i.e. they do not visit a doctor or other birth professional for prenatal care. There are potentially life-threatening consequences of having no medical follow-up in case there are complications.<ref name="Unassisted Births Dangerous"/>

== Prevalence ==
'''United States''':
The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] reports that of the 4.1 million babies born in the [[United States]] in 2004, more than 7,000 were born at home without a midwife or physician attending.<ref name="Do-It-Yourself Delivery"/> It is unknown what portion of these births, roughly equivalent to a sixth of 1% of the nation's annual total, occurred by choice.

'''Australia''':
It is not currently known how many women in [[Australia]] give birth at home by choice without medical assistance. Home births in Australia represent just 0.25 percent of all births, with the majority of these done with the assistance of a midwife.<ref name="Four Dead">{{cite news| last = Kara| first = Lawrence| last2 = Dunlevy| first2 = Sue| title = Four dead in home birthing including Joyous Birth advocate| publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph]]| date = 6 Apr 2009| url = http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25294178-5001021,00.html| accessdate = 19 Apr 2009}}</ref>

==Risks==
Unassisted childbirth has been linked to substantially elevated rates of both maternal and neonatal mortality. One of the few, and perhaps the only, formal investigation of the mortality rates associated with the practice was conducted by the [[Indiana]] State Board of Health in 1984, among members of a religious community in Indiana.  The investigation found a perinatal mortality rate 2.7 times higher, and a maternal mortality rate 97 times higher than the state average.  In this community, pregnant women receive no prenatal medical care and deliver at home without medical assistance.  This community avoids not only prenatal medical care but all medical care.<ref name="Indiana">{{cite journal| title = Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Perinatal and Maternal Mortality in a Religious Group -- Indiana | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report| volume = 33| issue = 21| pages = 297–8| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]| location = Atlanta, Georgia| date = June 1, 1984| url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000345.htm| accessdate = 29 Apr 2009| pmid = 6427572| author1 = Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}</ref>

According to the president of the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], Dr. Thomas Purdon, twenty percent of all previously normal pregnancies turn into complications and high-risk situations during the course of labor that could result in serious adverse outcome to mother and baby, including death.<ref name=nytimes1>{{Cite news| last = Hutter Epstein  | first = Randi| title = When Giving Birth, Opting to Go It Alone| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| publisher = The New York Times Company| date = 7 May 2002| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/health/womenshealth/07BIRT.html?ex=1021735419&ei=1&en=5c3649a5f3fa6d8f| accessdate = 19 Dec 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Controversy over the practice of UC has largely centered over whether it is, as claimed by proponents, a safe method of childbirth. Critics of UC, such as the [[Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada]] (SOGC), claim that unassisted childbirth is quite unsafe,<ref name="Unassisted Births Dangerous">{{Cite news| title = Unassisted births dangerous, doctors warn| newspaper = CBC News| year = 2007| date = 21 Jun 2007| url = http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/06/21/free-birth.html}}</ref> and that those who engage in it are "courting danger".<ref name="Canadian doctors warn"/> A spokesperson for the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] issued a one-word assessment of freebirth: "dangerous".<ref name="Baby's Day Out"/> The SOGC notes that more than 500,000 women worldwide die annually from complications during childbirth,<ref name="Canadian doctors warn"/> and that even in developed countries, in which expectant mothers generally receive complete prenatal care, as many as 15% of all births involve potentially fatal complications.<ref name="Canadian doctors warn"/> In poor countries in which there are conditions of malnutrition and taboos surrounding childbirth or there is a lack of qualified birth attendants, rates of [[maternal mortality|maternal]]<ref name="safermotherhood">[http://www.safemotherhood.org/facts_and_figures/maternal_mortality.htm Safer Motherhood Fact Sheet: Maternal Mortality]</ref> and [[infant mortality]]<ref name="who">[http://www.who.int/whr/2005/chapter4/en/index1.html World Health Organization 2005 World Health Report, Chapter 4: Risking Death To Give Life]</ref> and complications such as [[fistula]] are much higher, with disparities in death rates from childbirth between developed and developing countries approaching two orders of magnitude.<ref name="Obstetricians alarmed">{{Cite news| last = Laucius| first = Joanne| title = Obstetricians alarmed over 'freebirthing'| newspaper = Chek News (CanWest News Service)| year = 2007| date = 22 Jun 2007| url = http://www2.canada.com/ch/cheknews/story.html?id=a8fff231-1b2d-4345-b160-406af3830294| format = {{dead link|date=March 2010}}}}</ref> Critics also point out the high rates of complication and death arising from childbirth that existed before the development of modern medicine: between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths per 100,000 births.<ref name="vanlerberghe">Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V.

Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).</ref>

UC proponents have responded to these criticisms by emphasizing that childbirth is not a disease,  but rather a natural, physiological process requiring proper nutrition, hygiene, prenatal self-care, and psychological preparation.<ref name=bornfree></ref> They claim that both throughout history and in the impoverished regions of today's world it has not been the lack of medical assistance, but rather conditions of poverty and nutritional ignorance which cause maternal mortality to be a major health issue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[Rickets]], for example, is prevalent in daughters of malnourished women, resulting in deformation of the [[pelvis]] and an increased chance of [[hemorrhage]] in scenarios of [[anemia]].<ref name="Health and disease in Kenya">{{cite book | last = Gebbie| first = D.

Proponents also claim that modern maternal mortality rates in American hospitals are often obscured by being statistically tracked under 'anesthesiology'.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, evidence suggests that if this is in fact the case, the practice is unlikely to account for more than a small fraction of maternal deaths: one study of maternal mortality records lists the 'total' share of maternal mortality deaths recorded as stemming from anesthesia-related complications as just 5.2%.<ref name="Maternal mortality2">{{cite journal| coauthors = Sumedha Panchal, MD, Amelia M.

Other aspects of this response have also been called into question by scientific research. First, an analysis of historical data from Europe and the United States concluded that in developed countries, the main determinant of maternal mortality before 1937, and its decline since the 1930s, was ''not'' levels of poverty and associated malnutrition, but rather the overall standard of maternal care provided by birth attendants.<ref name="Maternal mortality">{{cite journal| last = Loudon| first = Irvine| title = Maternal mortality in the past and its relevance to developing countries today| journal = [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]| volume = 72| issue = 1| pages = 241–246| publisher = American Society for Clinical Nutrition| date = July 2000| url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/1/241S?ijkey=15188feef24c66546145d107dadf8a54b8c109e9&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha| issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 14 Apr 2009}}</ref>

Second, with respect to UC proponents' claim that unassisted childbirth is a natural process, researchers in the field of paleoanthropology have asserted that ''assisted'' childbirth is, in fact, a central evolutionary aspect of humanity, and may date back as far as five million years to when humanity's ancestors first began walking upright.<ref name="Anthropologist's Studies">{{Cite news| title = Anthropologist's Studies Of Childbirth Bring New Focus On Women In Evolution| newspaper = [[Science Daily]]| year = 2009| date = 25 Feb 2009| url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090217173043.htm}}</ref>

On 27 March, 2009, Janet Fraser, a leading advocate of UC and national convener of the highly popular ''Joyous Birth'' website, lost her child<ref name="Tragic sequel">{{cite news| last = Elder| first = John| title = Tragic sequel to home birth| publisher = The Age| date = 12 Apr 2009| url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/tragic-sequel-to-home-birth-20090411-a3hh.html| accessdate = 14 Apr 2009}}</ref> during a birth assisted only by her partner and a female friend.<ref name="Joyous Birth">{{cite news| last = Kara| first = Lawrence| title = Joyous Birth advocate's child birth death tragedy| publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph]]| date = 6 Apr 2009| url = http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25294329-5001021,00.html| accessdate = 28 Apr 2009}}</ref> In an interview five days earlier with [[The Age|The Sunday Age]], Fraser, in the early stages of labor at the time, stated that she had at no point during her pregnancy consulted with a health professional, and that she intended to deliver the baby at her home without an attending midwife.<ref name="Tragic sequel"/> The cause of death was reported to be cardiac arrest.<ref name="Tragic sequel"/><ref name="Fears">{{cite news| last = Barry| first = Evonne| title = Fears on mid-wife impact with new birthing regulations| publisher = Herald Sun| date = 19 Apr 2009| url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25351078-2862,00.html| accessdate = 28 Apr 2009}}</ref> A coronial inquest concluded in 2012 that Roisin Fraser's death was almost certainly preventable if the birth had proceeded in a maternity unit, and probably preventable if the birth at home had been attended by a registered midwife. It also found that Fraser's claim of "birthrape" during her first birth followed a planned homebirth attended by a midwife, where Fraser herself requested transfer to a hospital for epidural anaesthesia, and then subsequently requested caesarean birth without medical indications and against medical advice.<ref name="cornonersreport">{{Cite report| author=Magistrate Scott Mitchell, Deputy State Cornoner | date=28 June 2012| title=Inquest into the death of Roisin Fraser| url=http://www.coroners.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/agdbasev7wr/_assets/coroners/m401601l4/roisin%20fraser%20finding.pdf| publisher=Coroner's Court| docket=0817/2009| accessdate = 28 Oct 2012}}</ref>
