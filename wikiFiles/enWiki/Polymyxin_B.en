'''Polymyxin B''' is an antibiotic primarily used for resistant [[Gram-negative]] infections.  It is derived from the bacterium ''[[Bacillus polymyxa]]''. Polymyxin B is a mixture of two closely related compounds, polymyxin B1 and polymyxin B2.  It has a bactericidal action against almost all Gram-negative bacilli except the [[Proteus (bacterium)|''Proteus'']] group. Polymyxins bind to the cell membrane and alter its structure, making it more permeable. The resulting water uptake leads to cell death.  Polymyxins are [[cationic]], [[Basic (chemistry)|basic]] proteins that act like detergents ([[surfactant]]s).  Side effects include neurotoxicity and acute renal tubular necrosis. Polymyxins are used in the topical first-aid preparation [[Neosporin]].

#Family of polypeptides with attached fatty acid; [[cationic]] [[detergent]] at physiological pH, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties
#Bactericidal for [[gram-negative]]; little to no effect on [[gram-positive]], since cell wall is too thick to permit access to membrane

==Mechanism of action==
#Alters [[bacterial outer membrane]] permeability by binding to a negatively charged site in the lipopolysaccharide layer, which has an electrostatic attraction for the positively charged amino groups in the cyclic peptide portion (this site normally is a binding site for calcium and magnesium counter ions); the result is a destabilized outer membrane
#Fatty acid portion dissolves in hydrophobic region of [[cytoplasmic membrane]] and disrupts membrane integrity
#Leakage of cellular molecules, inhibition of cellular respiration
#Binds and inactivates endotoxin<ref name="pmid17201926">{{cite journal |author=Cardoso LS, Araujo MI, Góes AM, Pacífico LG, Oliveira RR, Oliveira SC |title=Polymyxin B as inhibitor of LPS contamination of Schistosoma mansoni recombinant proteins in human cytokine analysis |journal=Microb.

#Relative absence of selective toxicity:  nonspecific for cell membranes of any type, highly toxic

==Research application==
In addition to its antibiotic function, polymyxin B has been used to clear endotoxin contamination in reagents.
