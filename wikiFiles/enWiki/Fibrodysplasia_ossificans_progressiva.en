'''''Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva''''' (FOP), sometimes referred to as '''Stone Man Syndrome''', is an extremely rare disease of the [[connective tissue]]. A [[mutation]] of the body's repair mechanism causes fibrous tissue (including [[muscle]], [[tendon]], and [[ligament]]) to be [[ossification|ossified]] when damaged. In many cases, injuries can cause joints to become permanently frozen in place. Surgical removal of the extra bone growths has been shown to cause the body to "repair" the affected area with more bone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=2316509&page=1 |title=ABC News: When Body Turns to Bone |accessdate=2007-06-02 |work=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Children born with FOP have deformed [[Hallux|big toes]], possibly missing a joint or simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint. The first "flare-up" that leads to the formation of FOP bones usually occurs before the age of 10. FOP is a genetic disease. The bone growth progresses from the top downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop bones starting at the neck, then on the shoulders, arms, chest area and finally on the feet. Specifically, FOP involvement is typically seen first in the dorsal, axial, cranial and proximal regions of the body. Later the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal and distal regions of the body.<ref name="ReferenceA">Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Frederick S. Kaplan, MD, Martine Le Merrer, MD, PhD, Professor of Genetics, David L. Glaser, MD, Robert J. Pignolo, MD, PhD, Robert Goldsby, MD, Joseph A. Kitterman, MD, Jay Groppe, PhD, and Eileen M. Shore, PhD</ref> However it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize the disease appear suddenly. 

The gene that causes ossification is normally deactivated after a fetus' bones are formed in the womb, but in patients with FOP, the gene keeps working. Aberrant bone formation in patients with FOP occurs when injured connective tissue or muscle cells at the sites of injury or growth incorrectly express an enzyme for bone repair during [[apoptosis]] (self-regulated cell death), resulting in lymphocytes containing excess [[bone morphogenetic protein 4]] (BMP4) provided during the immune system response. The bone that results occurs independently of the normal skeleton, forming its own discrete skeletal elements.  These elements, however, can fuse with normal skeletal bone.<ref>Insights from a Rare Genetic Disorder of Extra-Skeletal Bone Formation, Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP).  Eileen M. Shore and Frederick S. Kaplan</ref> Interestingly, the diaphragm, tongue, and extra-ocular muscles are spared in this process, as well as cardiac and smooth muscle.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Since the incorrect enzyme remains unresolved within the immune response, the body continues providing the incorrect BMP4-containing lymphocytes. BMP4 is a product that contributes to the development of the skeleton in the normal embryo.<ref>{{Cite book

Because the disease is so rare, the symptoms are often misdiagnosed as cancer or [[fibrosis]]. This leads doctors to order [[Biopsy|biopsies]], which can actually exacerbate the growth of these lumps.

==Cases==
Since the 1800s, there have been references in medicine describing people who apparently "turned to stone"; some of these cases may be attributable to FOP.

The best known FOP case is that of [[Harry Raymond Eastlack|Harry Eastlack]] (1933–1973). His condition began to develop at the age of ten, and by the time of his death from pneumonia in November 1973, six days before his 40th birthday, his body had completely ossified, leaving him able to move only his lips.

Shortly before Eastlack's death, he made it known that he wanted to donate his body to science, in the hope that in death, he would be able to help find a cure for this little-understood and particularly cruel disease. Pursuant to his wishes, his preserved skeleton is now kept at the [[Mütter Museum]] in [[Philadelphia]], and has proven to be an invaluable source of information in the study of FOP. 

There have approximately been 700 confirmed cases across the globe from an estimated 2500.<ref>http://www.fopaction.co.uk/what-is-fop</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for FOP. Attempts to surgically remove the bone result in more robust bone growth.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00431 |title=Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) |publisher=orthoinfo.aaos.org |date=May 2006 |accessdate=2011-10-07}}</ref> While under [[anesthesia]], patients with FOP may face problems, which include difficulties with [[intubation]], [[restrictive pulmonary disease]], and changes in the [[electrical conduction system of the heart]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=M.C.|coauthors= Allen, P.W.; Ryan, D.C.| title=Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva|url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/2/246.short|publisher=British Journal of Anaesthesia|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref>
Activities that increase the risk of falling should be avoided, as injuries from falling can provoke the growth of bone.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/health/09fop.html The New York Times], "Finally, With Genetic Discovery, Hope for Escape From a Prison of Bone", May 9, 2006</ref>

In 1999, scientists discovered that [[squalamine]] in sharks<ref>{{cite web|author=BioInfoBank Library |url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:8433993 |title=Squalamine: an aminosterol antibiotic from the shark |publisher=Lib.bioinfo.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref> might be useful in treating those suffering from FOP.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/302528.stm BBC News], "Shark therapy for bizarre bone disease," March 24, 1999</ref> Squalamine is [[antiangiogenic]] and can prevent the growth of blood vessels in cartilaginous tissue, thus preventing creation of bone in sharks. A trial of squalamine started in 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15634_ITM |title=Article: Squalamine Trial For The Treatment Of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans... &#124; AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=2002-02-08 |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref> but terminated about 2007. (Note that [[squalene]] is a different compound, also found in sharks, that has no such properties.)

{{As of|November 2010}}, there are no registered clinical trials for FOP.<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=fibrodysplasia+ossificans</ref>

Researchers believe that specific [[kinase inhibitor]]s can be developed that will block the aberrant ACVR1 activity, and are actively investigating [[dorsomorphin]] and [[K02288]] as [[lead compound]]s with the intention of developing effective therapies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fopoxfordball.co.uk/content/oxfords-research-team|title=Oxfords Research Team|publisher=FOP Oxford Ball}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481300/|title=Structure of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor ALK2 and Implications for Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva|author=Apirat Chaikuad et al.|publisher=J Biol Chem.|date=2012-10-26|volume=287|number=44|pages=36990–36998}}</ref>  For example, the more potent dorsomorphin derivative LDN-193189 reduced ossification in a [[transgenic]] mouse model, in which the engineering of adult ACVR1 activity created an inflammation-dependent ossification sensitive to [[corticosteroid]] treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846458/|title=BMP type I receptor inhibition reduces heterotopic ossification|author=Paul B.

==Causes==
FOP is caused by an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominant gene|dominant allele]] on [[chromosome 3t13-77 (human)|chromosome 2q23-24]]. The allele has variable [[expressivity]], but complete [[penetrance]]. Most cases are caused by spontaneous mutation in the [[gamete]]s; most people with FOP cannot have children. A study has determined that it affects approximately 1 in every 2&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Connor JM, Evans DA |title=Genetic aspects of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva |journal=J.

A mutation in the gene [[ACVR1]] (also known as activin-like kinase 2 [ALK-2]) is responsible for the disease.<ref name="ACVR1">{{cite journal |author=Shore EM |title=A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva |journal=Nat.
