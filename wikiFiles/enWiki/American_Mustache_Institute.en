The '''American Mustache Institute (AMI)''' is an advocacy organization and registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit based in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. When founded in 1965, AMI was the only organization in the world working towards facial hair advocacy. AMI’s full-time staff supports more than 700 global chapters which advocate for greater acceptance of mustaches in the workplace and throughout modern culture.

==Discrimination==

Efforts by AMI have included a 2007 campaign against "widespread and unacceptable discrimination in the workplace and society", as chronicled by media including the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and [[The Learning Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1561394/Moustached-men-of-America-fight-back.html |title=Moustached men of America fight back |accessdate=2008-06-09 |last=Shipman |first=Tim |date=2007-08-26 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080616171251/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1561394/Moustached-men-of-America-fight-back.html| archivedate= 16 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In December 2007, AMI [[lobbied]] the [[Royse City, Texas|Royse City]], Texas School District on behalf of student Sebastian Pham, who had been forced by a teacher to shave his mustache, which in the opinion of Pham's family and AMI had violated his civil liberties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/122807dnmetmustacheboy.1c81a01.html |title=Royse City student pulls Mustache Institute into fight over facial hair |accessdate=2008-06-09 |last=Anderson |first=Karen Shaw |date=2007-12-28 |publisher=Dallas Morning News}}</ref> Additionally, the ''[[New York Times]]'' cited AMI as an example of modern online community building.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/business/media/01adnewsletter1.html?_r=3&st=cse&sq=mustache%2C+elliott&scp=19&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin |title=For Fans of (Upper) Lippy Web Sites |accessdate=2008-06-09 |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |date=2007-10-01|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

==Community work==
Part of the organization’s charter includes supporting communities in which it works, and therefore AMI created a charitable fundraising mechanism in 2006 for organizations such as Challenger Baseball, a baseball league for disabled children. AMI's first charitable fundraiser—'Stache Bash 2006 — was held in July 2006. The event raised awareness of the issue of mustache acceptance, supported mustachioed Americans, and raised funds for Challenger Baseball. The organization held its second ‘Stache Bash in 2007, and just prior [http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/finalword/2007-07-31-final-word_n.htm USA Today wrote] the event was part of AMI's efforts to "to protect the rights of, and bias against, mustached Americans." As part of 'Stache Bash 2007, AMI also conducted voting for [http://www.broowaha.com/article.php?id=2020 the “Greatest Sports Mustache”] of all time, which was won in a popular vote by former Major League Baseball player [[Keith Hernandez]] as announced by AMI in August 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmustacheinstitute.org/files/Voting_Winner-News_Release.pdf |title=Keith Hernandez Named Top Sports Mustache of All Time |publisher=American Mustache Institute |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-05}}</ref> Ultimately, the event raised enough funds to allow Challenger Baseball to add six new teams for the 2008 campaign.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Robert Goulet==
In September 2008, the AMI honored the late entertainer [[Robert Goulet]] in working with his spouse, Vera Goulet, to name an award in his honor, "The Robert Goulet Mustached American of the Year" award, recognizing the most influential Mustached American of the past year. On October 25, 2008, retired New York City policeman Timothy P. Galvin was named the winner of the first ever "Robert Goulet Memorial Mustached American of the Year".

=="Saving and Spending Patterns of Mustached Americans"==
In October 2009, AMI and [[Quicken]] commissioned a study entitled “Saving And Spending Patterns of Mustached Americans”. The research study examined a random sample of 2,000 Mustached Americans, along with 2,000 bearded and 2,000 clean-shaven Americans and found that Mustached Americans earned 8.2 percent more on average than those with beards and 4.3 percent more than the clean-shaven. The research also demonstrated that people of Mustached American descent also tended to spend 11 percent more and save 3 percent less than their collective counterparts.

==Stache Act==
AMI supports the proposal in the 'Stache Act, which calls for a [[tax deduction]] of up to $250 a year for facial hair grooming.<ref name="Nuckols201202">Ben Nuckols. AP. "[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20120229/D9T79K3G0.html Mustache Bill Puts Congressman in Hairy Situation]".</ref>
