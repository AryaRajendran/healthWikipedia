'''AVERT''' (formerly also known as the AIDS Education and Research Trust) is an international [[AIDS]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] based in [[Horsham]], [[South East England]], [[United Kingdom]].

==Early work==
AVERT was founded in 1986 by Peter Kanabus and his wife Annabel, daughter of former [[Sainsbury's]] chairman [[Robert Sainsbury]].<ref name="About AVERT">[http://www.avert.org/about.htm About AVERT]</ref> In its first fifteen years the charity focused on producing educational publications and funding HIV-related educational, social and medical research.<ref>{{cite book |title= AIDS in the UK|last=Berridge |first=Virginia  |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-820472-8 |pages= 179, 181 }} </ref>

A number of AVERT's publications, such as the ''AIDS: Working With Young People'' (1993) teaching pack were based on substantial educational research.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0415132436|title=Register of educational research 1992-1995}} </ref> In addition many thousands of AVERT's booklets were distributed in the UK each year, covering such topics as [[sex education]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[HIV]].<ref name="AVERT - 24dr.com">[http://www.24dr.com/reference/contact/group/avert.htm AVERT - 24dr.com]</ref> 

Medical research funded by AVERT included the first ever study of the effect of pregnancy on the progression of HIV disease,<ref name="AVERT - 24dr.com" /> and social research included studies of HIV and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] in UK [[prison]]s.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6945/1716 Drug use in prison], 
BMJ 1994;308:1716 (25 June)</ref>

In 2001 the charity decided to cease funding research and producing printed publications, and instead to concentrate on its educational website and work outside the UK in countries with a particularly high or rapidly increasing rate of HIV infection and AIDS.

==Avert.org==
The charity's educational website avert.org, established in 1995, claims to be the world's most popular AIDS website, receiving a reported two million [[page view]]s per month.<ref name="About AVERT" /> In 2005 the site won the [[British Medical Association]]'s Patient Information Award for Websites.<ref>[http://www.bma.org.uk/pressrel.nsf/wlu/PGAY-6HSE3J?OpenDocument&vw=wfmms Patient Information Awards at the BMA Medical Book Competition 2005]</ref>

==Overseas projects==
AVERT funds a range of projects in developing countries, predominantly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where the AIDS epidemic is most severe.<ref name="About AVERT" /> Organisations given money include [[Sangram]] in southwest [[India]],<ref>[http://www.avert.org/india-projects.htm AVERT’s HIV & AIDS Projects in India]</ref> and [http://www.tuproject.org Tholulwazi Uzivikele] in [[KwaZulu Natal]].<ref>[http://www.avert.org/aids-projects.htm AVERT’s HIV & AIDS Projects in Sub-Saharan Africa]</ref>

The charity's work made headlines in 2008 when [[South Africa]]n doctor Colin Pfaff was suspended from his post for supplying HIV positive, pregnant women with the antiretroviral drug [[zidovudine|AZT]],<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331069,00.html Clinicians Support South African Doctor in Dispute Over Providing AIDS Therapy for Pregnant Women], Fox News, February 18, 2008</ref> which had been paid for by AVERT.<ref>[http://www.avert.org/media/pdfs/trustees_report_and_accounts.pdf AVERT Trustees Report and Accounts 2008]</ref> At the time the South African government had not approved the use of AZT to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, even though it was recommended by the [[World Health Organisation]] and was widely used in other developing countries. Rural doctors, scientists, AIDS activists and organisations rallied in support of Pfaff, and the charges were subsequently dropped.<ref>[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-02-21-kzn-doctor-cleared-on-treatment-charge KZN doctor cleared on treatment charge], Mail & Guardian, February 21, 2008</ref>
