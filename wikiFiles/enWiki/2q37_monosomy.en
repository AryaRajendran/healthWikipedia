'''2q37 monosomy''' is a rare [[genetic disorder]] caused by a [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] of a segment at the end of [[chromosome 2]].<ref name="pmid15173228">{{cite journal |author=Aldred MA, Sanford RO, Thomas NS, Barrow MA, Wilson LC, Brueton LA, Bonaglia MC, Hennekam RC, Eng C, Dennis NR, Trembath RC |title=Molecular analysis of 20 patients with 2q37.3 monosomy: definition of minimum deletion intervals for key phenotypes. |journal=J Med Genet |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=433–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15173228 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2003.017202 |pmc=1735790}}</ref><ref name="pmid15521982">{{cite journal |author=Shrimpton AE, Braddock BR, Thomson LL, Stein CK, Hoo JJ |title=Molecular delineation of deletions on 2q37.3 in three cases with an Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like phenotype. |journal=Clin Genet |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=537–44 |year=2004 |pmid=15521982 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00363.x}}</ref>

==Clinical description==

Almost all patients with this syndrome have some degree of [[mental retardation]] and [[facial dysmorphism]] (round face, deep-set eyes, thin upper lip). Behavioural problems are common. [[Brachydactyly|Brachymetaphalangism]] ([[metacarpal]] or [[metatarsal]] shortening) is reported in ~50% of cases overall, but is typically not evident below the age of 2 years. There is striking phenotypic variability, and the size and extent of the deleted region cannot be used as accurate predictors of prognosis. Some patients have additional problems such as [[congenital heart disease]] and [[seizures]].

==Origin and Size of Deletion==
The minimal deletion causing this syndrome has been defined as a 3 megabase region that contains the genes [[GPR35]], [[GPC1]] and [[STK25]].
Almost all deletions are found to be terminal deletions at the end of chromosome 2. There is a high frequency of ''de novo'' deletions, but multiple cases within a single family are also observed. Equal proportions of maternally and paternally derived [[Chromosomal rearrangement|rearrangements]] were seen in Aldred's series. No common breakpoints for the deletion were identified indicating that the 2q37 rearrangement is unlikely to be mediated by [[Genetic recombination|non-homologous recombination]] and [[Low copy repeats|low-copy repeats]].<ref name="pmid15173228"/> In a study of 20 patients,<ref name="pmid15173228"/> no clear relationship was found between clinical features and the size or position of the [[monosomic]] region.
