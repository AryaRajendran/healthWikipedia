'''DNA condensation''' refers to the process of compacting [[DNA]] molecules ''[[in vitro]]'' or ''[[in vivo]]''.<ref name="Teif">{{cite journal |author=Teif V.B. and Bohinc K.|year=2011 |title=Condensed DNA: condensing the concepts |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.07.002 |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=208–222 |pmid=20638406}}</ref> Mechanistic details of DNA packing are essential for its functioning in the process of [[gene regulation]] in living systems.

DNA diameter is about 2&nbsp;nm, while the length of a stretched single molecule may be up to several dozens of centimetres depending on the organism. Many features of the DNA double helix contribute to its large stiffness, including the mechanical properties of the sugar-phosphate backbone, electrostatic repulsion between [[phosphate]]s (DNA bears on average one elementary negative charge per each 0.17&nbsp;nm of the [[double helix]]), stacking interactions between the bases of each individual strand, and strand-strand interactions. DNA is one of the stiffest natural polymers, yet it is also one of the longest molecules. This means that at large distances DNA can be considered as a flexible rope, and on a short scale as a stiff rod. Like a garden hose, unpacked DNA would randomly occupy a much larger volume than when it is orderly packed. Mathematically, for a non-interacting flexible chain randomly diffusing in 3D, the end-to-end distance would scale as a square root of the polymer length. For real polymers such as DNA this gives only very rough estimate; what is important, is that the space available for the DNA ''in vivo'' is much smaller than the space that it would occupy in the case of a free diffusion in the solution. In order to cope with the volume constraints, DNA has a striking property to pack itself in the appropriate solution conditions with the help of ions and other molecules. Usually, DNA condensation is defined as "the collapse of extended DNA chains into compact, orderly particles containing only one or a few molecules".<ref name="Bloomfield'97">{{cite journal |author=Bloomfield V.A.|year=1997 |pages=269–82 |title=DNA condensation by multivalent cations |volume=44 |journal=Biopolymers | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0282(1997)44:3<269::AID-BIP6>3.0.CO;2-T |issue=3 |pmid=9591479 }}</ref> This definition applies to many situations in vitro and is also close to the definition of DNA condensation in bacteria as "adoption of relatively concentrated, compact state occupying a fraction of the volume available".<ref name="Zimmerman&Murphy'96">{{cite journal |author=Zimmerman S.B. and Murphy L.D.|year=1996 |pages=245–8 |title=Macromolecular crowding and the mandatory condensation of DNA in bacteria |volume=390 |journal=FEBS Letters| doi=10.1016/0014-5793(96)00725-9 |issue=3 |pmid=8706869}}</ref> In [[eukaryotes]], the DNA size and the number of other participating players are much larger, and a DNA molecule forms millions of ordered [[nucleoprotein]] particles, the [[nucleosome]]s, which is just the first of many levels of DNA packing.<ref name="Teif" />

== DNA condensation in viruses ==
In [[virus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s, the DNA or RNA is surrounded by a protein [[capsid]], sometimes further enveloped by a lipid [[membrane]]. Double-stranded DNA is stored inside the capsid in the form of a spool, which can have different types of coiling leading to different types of [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystalline]] packing. This packing can change from [[hexagonal]] to [[cholesteric]] to [[isotropic]] at different stages of the phage functioning. Although the double helices are always locally aligned, the DNA inside viruses does not represent real [[liquid crystals]], because it lacks fluidity. On the other hand,  DNA condensed ''in vitro'', e.g. with the help of polyamines which are also present in viruses, is both locally ordered and fluid.<ref name="Teif" />

== DNA condensation in bacteria ==
Bacterial DNA is packed with the help of [[polyamines]] and proteins. Protein-associated DNA occupies about 1/4 of the intracellular volume forming a concentrated viscous phase with liquid crystalline properties, called the nucleoid. Similar DNA packaging exists also in [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]]. Bacterial DNA is sometimes referred to as the [[bacterial chromosome]]. Bacterial nucleoid evolutionary represents an intermediate engineering solution between the protein-free DNA packing in viruses and protein-determined packing in eukaryotes.<ref name="Teif" />

== DNA condensation in eukaryotes ==

Eukaryotic DNA with a typical length of dozens of centimeters should be orderly packed to be readily accessible inside the micrometer-size nucleus. In primitive unicellular eukaryotes such as [[dinoflagellates]], it is possible to distinguish liquid-crystalline chromosomal ordering<ref name="Chow">{{cite journal |author=Man H. Chow, Kosmo T. H. Yan, Michael J. Bennett, and Joseph T. Y. Wong |year=2010 |pages=1577–1587 |title=Birefringence and DNA Condensation of Liquid Crystalline Chromosomes  |volume=9 |journal=Eukaryot Cell. | doi=10.1128/EC.00026-10 |issue=10 |pmc=2950428 }}</ref> similar to bacterial chromosomes, just with higher DNA density. However, this is the only exception in the eukaryotic world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In other eukaryotes, DNA is arranged in the cell nucleus with the help of histones. In this case, the basic level of DNA compaction is the nucleosome, where the double helix is wrapped around the histone octamer containing two copies of each [[histone]] [[histone H2A|H2A]], [[histone H2B|H2B]], [[histone H3|H3]] and [[histone H4|H4]]. Linker [[histone H1]] binds the DNA between nucleosomes and facilitates packaging of the 10&nbsp;nm "beads on the string" nucleosomal chain into a more condensed 30&nbsp;nm fiber. Most of the time, between cell divisions, [[chromatin]] is optimized to allow easy access of transcription factors to active [[genes]], which are characterized by a less compact structure called [[euchromatin]], and to alleviate protein access in more tightly packed regions called [[heterochromatin]]. During the cell division, chromatin compaction increases even more to form [[chromosome]]s, which can cope with large mechanical forces dragging them into each of the two daughter cells.<ref name="Teif" />

== DNA condensation ''in vitro'' ==
DNA condensation can be induced ''in vitro'' either by applying external force to bring the double helices together, or by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments. The former can be achieved e.g. with the help of the osmotic pressure exerted by crowding neutral polymersin the presence of monovalent salts. In this case, the forces pushing the double helices together are coming from entropic random collisions with the crowding polymers surrounding DNA condensates, and salt is required to neutralize DNA charges and decrease DNA-DNA repulsion. The second possibility can be realized by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments by multivalent cationic charged ligands (multivalent [[metal ions]], inorganic [[cations]], [[polyamines]], [[protamines]], [[peptides]], [[lipids]], [[liposomes]] and [[proteins]]).<ref name="Teif" />

== Physics of DNA condensation ==
Condensation of long double-helical DNAs is a sharp [[phase transition]], which takes place within a narrow interval of condensing agent concentrations.[ref] Since the double helices come very closely to each other in the condensed phase, this leads to the restructuring of water molecules, which gives rise to the so called [[hydration forces]].[ref] In order to understand attraction between negatively charged DNA molecules, one also has to take into account [[counterion correlation|correlations]] between counterions in the solution.[ref]

== DNA condensation and gene regulation ==
Most nowadays descriptions of gene regulation are based on the approximations of [[equilibrium binding]] in [[dilute solution]]s, although it is clear that these assumptions are in fact violated in [[chromatin]]. The dilute-solution approximation is violated for two reasons. First, the chromatin content is far from being dilute, and second, the numbers of the participating molecules are sometimes so small, that it does not make sense to talk about the bulk concentrations. Further differences from dilute solutions arise due to the different binding affinities of proteins to condensed and uncondensed DNA. Thus in condensed DNA both the reaction rates can be changed and their dependence on the concentrations of reactants may become nonlinear.<ref name="Teif" />
