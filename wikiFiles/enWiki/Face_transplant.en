A '''face transplant''' is a medical procedure to replace all or part of a person's face. The world's first partial face transplant on a living human was carried out in [[France]] in 2005. The world's first full face transplant was completed in [[Spain]] in 2010.<ref name="nash"/>

==Beneficiaries of face transplant==
People with faces [[disfigurement|disfigured]] by [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[burn (injury)|burn]]s, disease, or [[birth defect]]s might aesthetically benefit from the procedure.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2516181.stm |title=Face transplants 'on the horizon' |publisher=BBC News  |date=27 November 2002 |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> Professor [[Peter Butler (surgeon)|Peter Butler]] at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] first suggested this approach in treating people with facial disfigurement in a Lancet Article in 2002.<ref>Face transplantation—fantasy or the future? Lancet 360:5–6; 2002.</ref> This suggestion caused considerable debate around the ethics of this procedure at that time.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

The alternative to a face transplant is to move the patient's own skin from their back, buttocks or thighs to their face in a series of as many as 50 operations to regain even limited function and a face that is often likened to a mask or a living [[quilt]].

L. Scott Levin MD FACS, Chair, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]], has described the procedure as "the single most important area of reconstructive research."

==History==

===Self as donor ("face replant")===
The world's first full-face replant operation was on nine-year-old Sandeep Kaur, whose face was ripped off when her hair was caught in a [[threshing machine|thresher]]. Sandeep's mother witnessed the accident. Sandeep arrived at the hospital unconscious with her face in two pieces in a plastic bag. An article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' recounts: "In 1994, a nine-year-old child in northern [[India]] lost her face and scalp in a [[threshing machine]] accident. Her parents raced to the hospital with her face in a plastic bag and a surgeon managed to reconnect the arteries and replant the skin."<ref name="Scientists prepare to turn fiction into fact with first full-face transplan">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1225537,00.html |title=Scientists prepare to turn fiction into fact with first full-face transplant | work=The Guardian |accessdate=25 November 2007 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Radford | date=27 May 2004}}</ref> The operation was successful, although the child was left with some muscle damage as well as scarring around the perimeter where the facial skin was sutured back on. Sandeep's doctor was [[Abraham Thomas]], one of [[India]]'s top [[microsurgery|microsurgeons]]. In 2004, Sandeep was training to be a nurse.<ref name="titleFace Transplant : Picture Slide Show : Discovery Health">{{cite web |url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/plasticsurgery/facetransplant/slideshow/slide.html |title=Face Transplant : Picture Slide Show|accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Discovery Health}}</ref>

In 1996, a similar operation was performed in the Australian state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], when a woman's face and scalp, torn off in a similar accident, was packed in ice and successfully reattached.<ref name="[[Seattle Times]]">{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970922&slug=2561892 |title=Woman's Face Reattached In Rare Surgery

===Partial face transplant===
The world's first partial face transplant on a living human was carried out on 27 November 2005<ref name="titleBBC NEWS | Health | 'My face transplant saved me'">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6058696.stm |title=  'My face transplant saved me' |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=BBC News | date=17 October 2006 | first=Naomi | last=Austin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4484728.stm |title=Woman has first face transplant |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 November 2005 |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> by [[Bernard Devauchelle]], an [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon]], and [[Jean-Michel Dubernard]] in [[Amiens]], France. [[Isabelle Dinoire]]<ref name="titleBBC NEWS | Health | 'My face transplant saved me'"/> underwent surgery to replace her original face, which had been mauled by her black Labrador dog. A triangle of face tissue from a brain-dead human's nose and mouth was grafted onto the patient. On 13 December 2007, the first detailed report of the progress of this transplant after 18 months was released in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and documents that the patient was happy with the results but also that the journey has been very difficult, especially with respect to her immune system's response.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/24/2451 Outcomes 18 Months after the First Human Partial Face Transplantation], ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', 13 December 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/12/AR2007121202012.html?nav=rss_print/asection Face-Transplant Patient 'Satisfied': Some Who Criticized Procedure Are Impressed With Results], By Rick Weiss, [[Washington Post]], Thursday, 13 December 2007; Page A22</ref>

Prior to his death, a documentary on the Discovery Channel showed he had stopped taking immuno-suppressant drugs in favor of herbal medication – suggested by his surgeon to be a contributing factor to his death.

A 29-year-old French man underwent surgery in 2007. He had a facial tumor called a [[neurofibroma]] caused by a genetic disorder. The tumor was so massive that the man could not eat or speak properly.

In March 2008, the treatment of 30-year-old [[neurofibromatosis]] victim Pascal Coler of France ended after he received what his doctors call the world's first successful almost full face transplant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4511813&page=1 |title=World's First Full Face Transplant Hailed |date=25 March 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |last=Watt |first=Nick |publisher=abcnews.go.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/23/wface123.xml |title=Man has first full-face transplant |date=25 March 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |last=Franklin |first=Katie |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK }}</ref>

[[Turkey]]'s third face transplant was a partial one that was carried out on 17 March 2012 on Hatice Nergis, a twenty-year old woman, at [[Gazi University]]'s hospital in Ankara by a team led by surgeon Dr. [[Selahattin Özmen]]. The patient from [[Kahramanmaraş]] had lost, six years before, her upper jaw including mouth, lips, palate, teeth and nasal cavity in a firearm accident, and was unable to eat. She had in the past undergone around 35 reconstructive plastic surgery operations. The donor was a 28-year old woman in [[Istanbul]], who committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2012/03/23/gazi-yuz-naklini-damardan-bagladi |newspaper=[[Sabah (Newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Gazi, yüz naklini 'damardan' bağladı |author=Cantürk, Safure |date=23 March 2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-03-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1260147&title=ucuncu-yuz-nakli-gazi-universitesi-tip-fakultesi-hastanesinde-basladi |newspaper=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |title=Üçüncü yüz nakli Gazi Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Hastanesi'nde başladı |date=17 March 2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-03-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25331432/ |newspaper=NTV MSNBC |title=Üçüncü yüz nakli bir kadına  |date=17 March 2012 |language=Rurkish |accessdate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>

===Full face transplant===
On 20 March 2010, a team of 30 Spanish doctors carried out the first full face transplant on a man injured in a shooting accident.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8639437.stm |title=Full face transplant 'a success' |date=23 April 2010 |publisher=BBC News  | first=Helen | last=Briggs}}</ref> It became the first full face transplant in the world.<ref name="nash"/>

On 8 July 2010, the French media reported that a full face transplant, including tear ducts and eyelids, was carried out at the Creteil Henri-Mondor hospital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20100708-french-doctors-carry-out-worlds-first-full-face-transplant|title=French doctors carry out world's first full-face transplant|date=8 July 2010|work=RFI|accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

In March 2011, a surgical team, led by [[MUDr.]] [[Bohdan Pomahač]] at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], performed a full face transplant on [[Dallas Wiens]] who was badly disfigured in a power line accident that left him blind and without lips, nose or eyebrows. The patient's sight couldn't be recovered but he has been able to talk on the phone and smell.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/medical/story/2011/03/Boston-hospital-performs-full-face-transplant---/45141872/1?csp=34news&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+usatoday-NewsTopStories+%28News+-+Top+Stories%29 |title=Boston hospital performs full face transplant |work=USA Today  |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>

On 19 March 2012, one of the longest and most extensive facial transplants ever (36 hours, from 4&nbsp;am 19 March to 2–3 PM 20 March; the 23rd ever to occur; from the hairline to the neck, replacing essentially everything but the eyes and the back remnants of the throat) took place on a Richard Lee Norris of [[Hillsville, Virginia]], who had suffered a gunshot wound in 1997 that left him with extensive facial trauma, at the [[R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center]] at the [[University of Maryland Medical Center]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/27/36-hour-face-transplant-most-extensive-ever/ | work=CNN | title=36-Hour Face Transplant 'Most Extensive' Ever | date=27 March 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.sciencedebate.com/science-blog/face-transplant-university-maryland-transplant-included-jaws-teeth-and-tongue</ref> Seven months after the procedure, Norris exhibits remarkable progress.

===In Turkey===
On 21 January 2012, [[Turkey|Turkish]] surgeon Dr. [[Ömer Özkan]] and his team successfully performed a full face transplant at [[Akdeniz University]]'s hospital in [[Antalya]]. The 19-year-old patient, Uğur Acar's face was badly burnt in a house fire when he was a baby. The donor was 39-year-old Ahmet Kaya, who died on 20 January.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-surgeons-in-countrys-first-face-transplant.aspx?pageID=238&nID=12024&NewsCatID=341 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |title=Turkish surgeons in country's first face transplant |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-26 }}</ref> The Turkish doctors declared that his body had accepted the new tissue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19966156.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=İlk kez başın karşısında |date=21 February 2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-02-25 }}</ref>

Almost one month later on 24 February 2012, a surgical team led by Dr. [[Serdar Nasır]] conducted the country's second successful full face transplant at [[Hacettepe University]]'s hospital in [[Ankara]] on 25-year-old Cengiz Gül. The patient's face was badly burned in a [[Implosion (mechanical process)#Cathode ray tube and fluorescent lighting implosion|television tube implosion]] accident when he was two years old. The donor was 40-year-old N. A. (his family did not allow revealing of his identity), who experienced [[brain death]] two days before the surgery following a motorcycle accident occurred on 17 February.<ref name="h">{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19995909.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=İlkinin izi geçmeden 2’nci yüz nakli |authors=Özgenç, Meltem & Turaç Top |date=25 February 2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-02-25 }}</ref>

On 16 May 2012, surgeon Dr. Ömer Özkan and his team at the Akdeniz University Hospital performed country's third and their second full face transplant, fourth face transpant in Turkey at all. The face and ears of the 27-year old patient Turan Çolak from [[Izmir]] were burnt as he fell into an oven when he was three and half years old. The donor was Tevfik Yılmaz, a 19-year young man from [[Uşak]], who had attempted suicide on 8 May. He was declared brain dead in the evening hours of 15 May after having been in intensive care station for seven days. His parents donated all his organs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2012/05/15/ozkan-ve-ekibinden-2-yuz-nakli |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Özkan ve ekibinden 2. yüz nakli |author=Öztürk, Erdoğan |date=15 May 2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-19 }}</ref>

===In the United Kingdom===

In October 2006, surgeon [[Peter Butler (surgeon)|Peter Butler]] at London's [[Royal Free Hospital]] in the UK was given permission by the [[National Health Service|NHS]] ethics board to carry out the face transplant. His team will select four adult patients (children cannot be selected due to concerns over consent), with operations being carried out at six-month intervals.<ref name="titleUK gets face transplant go-ahead">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6083392.stm |title= UK gets face transplant go-ahead |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=BBC News | date=25 October 2006}}</ref>

===In the United States===
{{wikinews|Cleveland, Ohio clinic performs US's first face transplant}}
In 2004, the [[Cleveland Clinic]] in [[Ohio]], United States, became the first institution to approve this surgery and test it on cadavers.

In 2005, the Cleveland Clinic became the first US hospital to approve the procedure. In December 2008, a team at the Cleveland Clinic, led by [[Maria Siemionow|Dr Maria Siemionow]] and including a group of supporting doctors and six plastic surgeons (Dr Steven Bernard, Dr Mark Hendrickson, Dr Robert Lohman, Dr Dan Alam and Dr Francis Papay) performed the first face transplant in the US on a woman named [[Connie Culp]].<ref name="titleUS plans first face transplant">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4259538.stm |title=US plans first face transplant |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=BBC News | date=19 September 2005}}</ref><ref name="Cleveland Clinic performs first full face transplant">{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g4njTcm3JxdkeF3xkWT4J5Dk5QtwD953UAC00 |title= AP NewsFlash | accessdate=16 December 2008}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> It was the world's first near-total facial transplant and the fourth known facial transplant to have been successfully performed to date. This operation was the first facial transplant known to have included bones, along with muscle, skin, blood vessels, and nerves. The woman received a nose, most of the sinuses around the nose, the upper jaw, and even some teeth from a brain-dead donor. As doctors recovered the donor's facial tissue, they paid special attention to maintaining arteries, veins, and nerves, as well as soft tissue and bony structures. The surgeons then connected facial graft vessels to the patient's blood vessels in order to restore blood circulation in the reconstructed face before connecting arteries, veins and nerves in the 22-hour procedure. She had been disfigured to the point where she could not eat or breathe on her own as a result of a traumatic injury several years ago, which had left her without a nose, right eye and upper jaw. Doctors hoped the operation would allow her to regain her sense of smell and ability to smile, and said she had a "clear understanding" of the risks involved.

The second partial face transplant in the US took place at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in Boston on 9 April 2009. During a 17-hour operation, a surgical team led by [[MUDr.]] [[Bohdan Pomahač]], replaced the nose, upper lip, cheeks, and roof of the mouth – along with corresponding muscles, bones and nerves – of James Maki, age 59. Mr. Maki's face was severely injured after falling onto the electrified third rail at a Boston subway station in 2005. In May 2009, he made a public media appearance and declared he was happy with the result.<ref>[http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2009/05/face-transplant-recipient-says-hes-happy-with-results.html usatoday] article ''Face transplant recipient 'happy' with results''</ref> This procedure was also shown in the eighth episode of the ABC documentary series [[Boston Med]].

The first full face transplant performed in the US was done on a construction worker named [[Dallas Wiens]] in March 2011. He was burned in an electrical accident in 2008. This operation, performed by Dr. Bohdan Pomahač and Dr. Jeffrey Janis,<ref>{{cite web|last=Keiper|first=Lauren|title=U.S. man shows off first full face transplant|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/05/09/us-man-shows-off-first-full-face-transplant|publisher=Toronto Sun|accessdate=2011-05-10|date=2011-05-09}}</ref> was paid for with the help of the US defense department.

57-year old [[Charla Nash]], who was mauled by a chimpanzee in 2009, underwent a 20-hour full face transplant in May 2011 at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in [[Boston]].

In March 2012, a face transplant was completed at the University of Maryland Medical Center and R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center under the leadership of plastic surgeon Eduardo Rodriguez, DDS, MD and his team (Amir Dorafshar MBChB, Michael Christy MD, Branko Bojovic MD, Daniel Borsuk MD).<ref>{{cite news|last=jaffer khan|first=Nasheet|title=The team of five worked miracle|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/usa/the-team-of-five-worked-a-miracle-1.1001247|accessdate=13 April 2012|newspaper=gulfnews|date=29 March 2012}}</ref> The recipient was a 37-year old man who had suffered a facial ballistic injury in 1997.

==Ethics, Surgery and Post-Operation treatment==
The procedure consists of a series of operations requiring rotating teams of specialists. With issues of tissue type, age, sex, and skin color taken into consideration, the patient's face is removed and replaced (sometimes including the underlying fat, nerves, blood vessels, bones, and/or musculature). The surgery may last anywhere from 8 to 15 hours, followed by a 10–14-day hospital stay.

There has been a substantial amount of ethical debate surrounding the operation and its performance. The main issue is that, as noted below, the procedure entails submitting otherwise physically healthy people to potentially fatal, life long immunosuppressant therapy. So far, two people have died of complications related to the procedure. Citing the comments of various plastic surgeons and medical professionals from France and Mexico, anthropologist Samuel Taylor-Alexander suggests that the operation has been infused nationalist import, which is ultimately influencing the decision making and ethical judgements of the involved parties.<ref>Taylor-Alexander, S. 2013. On Face Transplantation: Ethical Slippage and Quiet Death in Experimental Biomedicine. Anthropology Today. 29(1):13-16</ref>

After the procedure a lifelong regimen of [[immunosuppressive]] drugs is necessary to suppress the patient's own [[immune system]]s and prevent rejection. Long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of developing life-threatening infections, kidney damage, and cancer. The surgery may result in complications such as infections that could turn the new face black and require a second transplant or reconstruction with skin grafts.

==Popular culture==
*The procedure was very grotesquely, yet somewhat accurately, highlighted in [[Georges Franju]]'s 1960 [[cult film|cult horror]] film ''[[Eyes Without a Face|Les Yeux sans visage]]'', which translates to "Eyes Without a Face."
*[[Kōbō Abe]], Japanese author and playwright, wrote ''[[The Face of Another]]'' (1964) about a plastics scientist who loses his face in an accident and proceeds to construct a new face for himself. With a new face, the [[protagonist]] sees the world in a new way and even goes so far as to have a clandestine "affair" with his estranged wife. This novel was made into a [[The Face of Another (film)|film of the same name]] by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] in 1966.
*The plot of the 1997 film ''[[Face/Off]]'' is based on a face transplant operation that involved changing the underlying structure and actual face shape. In the film, the transplant is shown to be reversible, with the patient being able to replace his original face if desired.
*An episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[The Bob Next Door]], features [[Sideshow Bob]] using face transplants to exchange his face with a cellmate as part of an elaborate prison escape plan so he can murder [[Bart Simpson|Bart]].
*The procedure is included in the eighteenth episode of fifth season of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', titled [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|Stand By Me]].
*Episode 9 of [[Nip/Tuck (season 3)|Season 3]] of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' includes the procedure.
*In the [[30 Rock]] episode [[Somebody to Love (30 Rock)|Somebody to Love]] Jack's girlfriend Celeste receives a face transplant after she was attacked by her neighbor's dog.
*There are advertisement posters in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' that display "Replace Your Face, Coming in 2057", that promote cosmetic face transplants.
