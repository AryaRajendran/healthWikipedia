'''Corneocytes''' are terminally [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] [[keratinocytes]] and compose most if not all of the [[stratum corneum]], the outermost part of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. They are regularly replaced through [[desquamation]] and renewal from lower [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] layers, making them an essential part of the [[skin]] barrier property.

==Structure==
Corneocytes are polyhedral, anucleated [[cell (biology)|cells]] without [[cytoplasm]]ic [[organelles]], interlocked with each other and organized as vertical columns of 10–30 [[cell (biology)|cells]] and embedded within a highly [[hydrophobic]] [[lipid]] matrix to form the [[stratum corneum]]. Even if biologically dead they remain active, being filled with [[keratin]], [[lipids]], [[fatty acids]] and [[ceramides]].<ref name="skins">http://www.skin-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=SKIN_SCIENCE_ROOT^AN_ORGAN_REVEALED^THE_EPIDERMIS&cur=THE_EPIDERMIS</ref><ref name="elias">{{cite journal

Corneocytes in the lower part of the [[stratum corneum]] are bridged together through specialized junctions (corneodesmosomes). Those junctions disintegrate as corneocytes migrate toward the surface of the [[skin]] and result in [[desquamation]].<ref name="skins" /> At the same time, as those loosened junctions encounter more hydration, they will expand and connect together, forming potential entry pores for [[microorganisms]] across the [[stratum corneum]].<ref name="elias" />

The corneocyte [[cell (biology)|cell]] layer ([[stratum corneum]]) can absorb three times its weight in water but if its water content drops below 10% it no longer remains pliable and cracks.<ref>http://www.radcliffe-oxford.com/books/samplechapter/7750/01_bensouillah-241a6c80rdz.pdf</ref>

==Formation==
Corneocytes are [[keratinocytes]] in their last stage of [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. [[Keratinocytes]] in the [[stratum basale]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] will multiply through [[cell division]] and migrate toward the [[skin]] surface. During that migration [[keratinocytes]] will undergo multiple stages of [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] to finally become corneocytes once they reach the [[stratum corneum]]. As corneocytes are continually eliminated through [[desquamation]] or through rubbing, skin washing or detergents they are also continually formed through [[keratinocyte]] [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]].<ref name="skins" />

==Localization==
{{main|epidermis (skin)}}
Corneocytes are part of the [[stratum corneum]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and contribute the barrier function of the [[skin]].
