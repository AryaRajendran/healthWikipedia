The '''health care reform debate in the United States''' has been a political issue for many years, focusing upon increasing coverage, decreasing the cost and social burden of healthcare, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. Following [[United States presidential election, 2008|the election of Barack Obama]], who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, [[PPACA|legislation was enacted]] in March 2010.

In 2009, the U.S. had the highest healthcare costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, with an estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 15.6% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) without insurance coverage. Some critics of reform counter that almost four out of ten of these uninsured come from an household with over $50,000 income per year, and thus might be uninsured voluntarily, or opting to pay for health care services on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/09/383-of-uninsured-americans-live-in.html|title=Almost 4 Out of 10 Uninsured Americans Live in Households Making More Than $50,000 Per Year|work=CARPE DIEM}}</ref>

Further, an estimated 77 million [[Baby Boomers]] are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/coming_gen_storm_e_02.pdf |title=coming_gen_storm_e.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |work=The Economist}}</ref> Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview Transcript-November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Quality of Care==
There is significant debate regarding the quality of the U.S. healthcare system relative to those of other countries. [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], a political advocacy group, has claimed that a free market solution to health care provides a lower quality of care, with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems.<ref name="fpb">[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hospitals_cost_more_and_have_higher_death_rates.php For-Profit Hospitals Cost More and Have Higher Death Rates], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''</ref> The quality of [[health maintenance organizations]] and [[managed care]] have also been criticized by this same group.<ref>[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hmos_provide_worse_quality_care.php For-Profit HMOs Provide Worse Quality Care], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''</ref>

According to a 2000 study of the [[World Health Organization]], publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on health care, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Prelims i-ixx/E |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> However, conservative commentator [[David Gratzer]] and the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected health care performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.<ref name="fmc">[[David Gratzer]], [http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php Why Is not Government Health Care The Answer?], ''Free Market Cure'', July 16, 2007</ref><ref>Glen Whitman, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/bp101.pdf "WHO’s Fooling Who?

Some medical researchers say that patient satisfaction surveys are a poor way to evaluate medical care. Researchers at the [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] asked 236 elderly patients in two different managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care in medical records, as reported in [[Annals of Internal Medicine]]. There was no correlation. "Patient ratings of health care are easy to obtain and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of medical care," said John T. Chang, [[UCLA]], lead author.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115758434624755703.html Capital: In health care, consumer theory falls flat] David Wessel, Wall Street Journal, September 7, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Rand study finds patients' ratings of their medical care do not reflect the technical quality of their care |publisher=RAND Corporation |date=May 1, 2006 |url=http://www.rand.org/news/press.06/05.01.html |accessdate=August 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chang JT, Hays RD, Shekelle PG, ''et al.'' |title=Patients' global ratings of their health care are not associated with the technical quality of their care |journal=Ann.

There are health losses from insufficient health insurance. A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to Americans lacking health insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf|title=American Journal of Public Health &#124; December 2009, Vol 99, No.12|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/excess-deaths-state-by-state.pdf|title=State-by-state breakout of excess deaths from lack of insurance|format=PDF}}</ref> More broadly, estimates of the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care were estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.<ref>A 1997 study carried out by Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler (''New England Journal of Medicine'' 336, no. 11 1997) "concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care—three times the number of people who died of AIDs."

==Cost and efficiency==
[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Health spending per capita, in US$ [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], compared amongst various first world nations.]]

The United States spends a [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|higher proportion]] of its GDP on health care (19.3% in ref cited, but now 16%, [[Health care compared|lagging other rich countries]]) than any other country in the world, except for [[East Timor]] (Timor-Leste).<ref name="WHO 2009">{{cite web |author=WHO |month=May |year=2009 |title=World Health Statistics 2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2009/en/index.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> The number of employers who offer health insurance is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and prices have risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].<ref name="Kaiser 2007">{{cite press release |title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1% In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |accessdate=September 13, 2007}}</ref>

Private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in [[Health Affairs]] estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes&nbsp;— 73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.<ref>{{cite journal | coauthors = Cathy Schoen, M.S., Michelle M.

However, a study published by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in 2008 found that the typical large employer [[Preferred provider organization]] (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] Standard Option.<ref>Dale Yamamoto, Tricia Neuman and Michelle Kitchman Strollo, [http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7768.pdf ''How Does the Benefit Value of Medicare Compare to the Benefit Value of Typical Large Employer Plans?''], [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], September 2008</ref> One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in ''Health Affairs'' that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Himmelstein DU, Warren E, Thorne D, Woolhandler S |title=Illness and injury as contributors to bankruptcy |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives |pages=W5–63–W5–73 |year=2005 |pmid=15689369 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w5.63}}</ref> although other sources dispute this.<ref>Todd Zywicki, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=587901 "An Economic Analysis of the Consumer Bankruptcy Crisis"], 99 NWU L.

Proponents of health care reforms involving expansion of government involvement to achieve universal health care argue that the need to provide profits to investors in a predominantly free market health system, and the additional administrative spending, tends to drive up costs, leading to more expensive health care provision.<ref name="fpb"/>

According to economist and former US Secretary of Labor, [[Robert Reich]], only a "big, national, [[public option]]" can force insurance companies to cooperate, share information, and reduce costs. Scattered, localized, "[[Health insurance cooperative|insurance cooperatives]]" are too small to do that and are "designed to fail" by the moneyed forces opposing Democratic health care reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi8A_HutII|title=Robert Reich Public Option Video}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2009/06/public-option-smokescreens-and-what-you.html|title=How Pharma and Insurance Intend to Kill the Public Option, And What Obama and the Rest of Us Must Do}}</ref>

===Impact on U.S. economic productivity===
On March 1, 2010, billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] (who is considered one of the world’s most savvy investors) said that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees’ health care put them at a competitive disadvantage.  He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on health care with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, “that kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body.”<ref>{{Cite news | last = Funk | first = Josh | title = Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com) | date = Mar. 1, 2010 | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care | accessdate =Apr. 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Allegations of waste===

In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the health care system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pear | first = Robert | title = Health Official Takes Parting Shot at ‘Waste’ | newspaper = New York Times | date = Dec. 3, 2011 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html?_r=1&emc=eta1

==Proposed strategies for reform==
{{Main|Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration}}

During a June 2009 speech, President [[Barack Obama]] outlined his strategy for reform. He mentioned electronic record-keeping, preventing expensive conditions, reducing obesity, refocusing doctor incentives from quantity of care to quality, [[Bundled payment|bundling payments]] for treatment of conditions rather than specific services, better identifying and communicating the most cost-effective treatments, and reducing defensive medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-the-Annual-Conference-of-the-American-Medical-Association |title=Remarks by the President to the AMA-June 15, 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an [[insurance exchange]] for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics.<ref name="Summary of Obama Plan">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/obama_plan_card.PDF |title=Summary of Obama Plan |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name="whitehouse.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-a-Joint-Session-of-Congress-on-Health-Care/ |title=Remarks by the President to a Joint Session of Congress-September 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

OMB Director [[Peter Orszag]] described aspects of the Obama administration's strategy during an interview in November 2009: "In order to help contain [Medicare and Medicaid] cost growth over the long term, we need a new health care system that has digitized information... in which that information is used to assess what’s working and what’s not more intelligently, and in which we’re paying for quality rather than quantity while also encouraging prevention and wellness." He also argued for bundling payments and [[accountable care organization]]s, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview-November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

[[Mayo Clinic]] President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four "pillars" of such a strategy:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10496|title=Denis Cortese Interview on Charlie Rose Show-July 2009}}</ref>
* Focus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;
* Pay for and align incentives with value;
* Cover everyone;
* Establish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved.

Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', surgeon [[Atul Gawande]] further distinguished between the delivery system, which refers to how medical services are provided to patients, and the payment system, which refers to how payments for services are processed. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take "at least a decade." He recommended changes that address the [[overutilization]] of healthcare; the refocusing of incentives on value rather than profits; and comparative analysis of the cost of treatment across various healthcare providers to identify best practices. He argued this would be an iterative, empirical process and should be administered by a "national institute for healthcare delivery" to analyze and communicate improvement opportunities.<ref name="newyorker.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande|title=The New Yorker-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009}}</ref>

===Use of comparative effectiveness research===
[[File:Medicare spending per capita.png|thumb|Medicare spending per person varied significantly across states in 2006]]
Several treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs yet no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care, while significantly reducing costs, through [[comparative effectiveness research]]. Writing in the New York Times, [[David Leonhardt]] described how the cost of treating the most common form of early-stage, slow-growing [[prostate]] cancer ranges from an average of $2,400 (watchful waiting to see if the condition deteriorates) to as high as $100,000 (radiation beam therapy):<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html|title=NYT-Leonhardt-In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test | work=The New York Times | date=July 8, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> {{quote|Some doctors swear by one treatment, others by another. But no one really knows which is best. Rigorous research has been scant. Above all, no serious study has found that the high-technology treatments do better at keeping men healthy and alive. Most die of something else before prostate cancer becomes a problem.}}

According to economist [[Peter A. Diamond]] and research cited by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the U.S. also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9317/05-29-NASI_Speech.pdf|title=Peter Diamond-Healthcare and Behavioral Economics-May 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

{{Quote|Although the Mayo Clinic scores above the other two in terms of quality of outcome, its cost per beneficiary for Medicare clients in the last six months of life ($26,330) is nearly half that at the UCLA Medical Center ($50,522) and significantly lower than the cost at Massachusetts General Hospital ($40,181)... The American taxpayer is financing these large differences in costs, but we have little evidence of what benefit we receive in exchange.}}

Comparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Director [[Peter Orszag]] stated: "Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande|title=The New Yorker-Gawande-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009}}</ref>

===Reform of doctor's incentives===
Critics have argued that the healthcare system has several incentives that drive costly behavior. Two of these include:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html|title=NYT-Leonhardt-In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test-July 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=July 8, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>
# Doctors are typically paid for services provided rather than with a salary. This payment system (which is often referred to as "[[fee-for-service]]") provides a financial incentive to increase the costs of treatment provided.
# Patients that are fully insured have no financial incentive to minimize the cost when choosing from among alternatives. The overall effect is to increase insurance premiums for all.

===Insurance reforms===
The debate has involved certain insurance industry practices such as the placing of caps on coverage, the high level of co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a pre-existing condition, and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition.

Various legislative proposals under serious consideration propose fining larger employers who do not provide a minimum standard of health care insurance and [[individual mandate|mandating]] that people purchase private health care insurance. This is the first time that the Federal government has mandated people to buy insurance, although nearly all states in the union currently mandate the purchase of auto insurance. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called "Cadillac policies") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. These will be offered on a sliding scale to people earning less than four times the federal poverty level to enable them to buy health insurance if they are not otherwise covered by their employer.

The issue of concentration of power by the insurance industry has also been a focus of debate as in many states very few large insurers dominate the market. Legislation which would provide a choice of a not-for-profit insurer modeled on Medicare but funded by insurance premiums has been a contentious issue. Much play has been made to changes to the [[Medicare Advantage]] scheme which will reduce public subsidies given to private insurance plans selling such plans by forcing insurers to compete and which it is estimated has increased the profitability of private insurance companies selling these products.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703932904574511090636399788.html "Humana's third-quarter earnings rose 65% amid improved margins at its government segment and prior-year investment losses"] Wall Street Journal</ref> No cuts are made to guaranteed coverage benefits in the bills before congress.

Certain proposals include a choice of a not-for-profit insurer modeled on Medicare (sometimes called the "government option"). Democratic legislators have largely supported the proposed reform efforts, while Republicans have criticized the government option or expanded regulation of healthcare.

The [[GAO]] reported in 2002 (using 2000 data) that: "The [[median]] number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 28, with a range from 4 in Hawaii to 77 in Indiana. The median market share of the largest carrier was about 33 percent, with a range from about 14 percent in Texas to about 89 percent in North Dakota."<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02536r.pdf GAO-Letter to Honorable Christopher "Kit" Bond-March 2002] The letter states "A carrier is generally an entity (either an insurer or managed health care plan) that bears the risk for
and administers a range of health benefit offerings."</ref>

The GAO reported in 2008 (using 2007 data for the most part) that: "The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 27. The median market share of the largest carrier in the small group market was about
47 percent, with a range from about 21 percent in Arizona to about 96 percent in Alabama. In 31 of the 39 states supplying market share information, the top carrier had a market share of a third or more. The five largest carriers in the small group market, when combined, represented three quarters or more of the market in 34 of the 39 states supplying this information, and they
represented 90 percent or more in 23 of these states....the median market share of all the BCBS carriers in 38 states reporting this information in 2008 was about 51 percent, compared to the 44 percent reported in 2005 and the 34 percent reported in 2002 for the 34 states supplying information in each of these years."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09363r.pdf |title=GAO-09-363R Private Health Insurance: 2008 Survey Results on Number and Market Share of Carriers in the Small Group Health Insurance Market |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Tax reform===
[[File:Compensation - Gross and Net of Health Insurance Premiums.png|thumb|Health insurance premiums paid on behalf of workers are increasingly offsetting compensation]]

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has also described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf|title=CBO-Testimony to Senate Finance Committee-June 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>
{{Quote|One factor perpetuating inefficiencies in health care is a lack of clarity regarding the cost of health insurance and who bears that cost, especially employment-based health insurance. Employers’ payments for employment-based health insurance and nearly all payments by employees for that insurance are excluded from individual income and payroll taxes. Although both theory and evidence suggest that workers ultimately finance their employment-based insurance through lower take-home pay, the cost is not evident to many workers.... If transparency increases and workers see how much their income is being reduced for employers’ contributions and what those contributions are paying for, there might be a broader change in cost-consciousness that shifts demand.}}

In November 2009, ''[[The Economist]]'' estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14903024 |title=The Economist-Stemming the Tide-November 2009 |work=The Economist  |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=November 19, 2009}}</ref> [[Peter Singer]] wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html|title=NYT-Singer-Why We Must Ration Healthcare-July 15, 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=July 19, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> In other words, taxpayers might be more inclined to change behavior or the system itself if they were paying $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. To put this amount in perspective, the federal government collected $1,146 billion in income taxes in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/100xx/doc10014/March2009_HistoricalTables.pdf|title=CBO Historical Tables|format=PDF}}</ref> so $200 billion represents a 17.5% increase in the effective tax rate.

===Independent advisory panels===
President Obama has proposed an "Independent Medicare Advisory Panel" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Comparative effectiveness research would be one of many tools used by the IMAC. The IMAC concept was endorsed in a letter from several prominent healthcare policy experts, as summarized by [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Director [[Peter Orszag]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/04/AnotherlookatIMAC/|title=OMB Director Orszag-IMAC}}</ref>

{{quote|Their support of the IMAC proposal underscores what most serious health analysts have recognized for some time: that moving toward a health system emphasizing quality rather than quantity will require continual effort, and that a key objective of legislation should be to put in place structures (like the IMAC) that facilitate such change over time. And ultimately, without a structure in place to help contain health care costs over the long term as the health market evolves, nothing else we do in fiscal policy will matter much, because eventually rising health care costs will overwhelm the federal budget.}}

===Rationing of care===
<!--health care is not a commodity, "ration" is absurd http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=ration -->
[[Healthcare rationing in the United States|Healthcare rationing]] may refer to the restriction of medical care service delivery based on any number of objective or subjective criteria. Republican [[Newt Gingrich]] argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-gingrich16-2009aug16,0,3301006.story|title=LA Times-Gingrich-Healthcare Rationing-Real Scary | work=Los Angeles Times | date=August 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical [[pre-existing condition]]s, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argued that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of medical pre-existing conditions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16obama.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=opinion|title=NYT-President Obama-Why We Need Healthcare Reform-August 15, 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=August 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

[[Peter Singer]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' in July 2009 that healthcare is rationed in the United States and argued for improved rationing processes:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html|title=NYT-Singer-Why We Must Ration Healthcare-July 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=July 19, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>
{{quote|Health care is a scarce resource, and all scarce resources are rationed in one way or another. In the United States, most health care is privately financed, and so most rationing is by price: you get what you, or your employer, can afford to insure you for...Rationing health care means getting value for the billions we are spending by setting limits on which treatments should be paid for from the public purse. If we ration we won’t be writing blank checks to pharmaceutical companies for their patented drugs, nor paying for whatever procedures doctors choose to recommend. When public funds subsidize health care or provide it directly, it is crazy not to try to get value for money. The debate over health care reform in the United States should start from the premise that some form of health care rationing is both inescapable and desirable. Then we can ask, What is the best way to do it?"}}

According to PolitiFact, private health insurance companies already ration health care by income, by denying health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions and by caps on health insurance payments.

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' columnist Christopher Beam used the term "deathers" to refer to those who believed rationing and euthanasia would become likely for senior citizens. ''The [[Rachel Maddow]] Show'' aired a program called "Obama and the Deathers" in which Maddow discussed conspiracy theories that included "a secret plot to kill old people." [[Daily Kos]] and other web sites had used the term for about a week before [[Hari Sevugan]], national spokesman for the [[Democratic National Committee]], sent out an email with the subject line "Murkowski: Deathers 'Lying' 'Inciting Fear.'" The message included an article about a [[Town hall meeting|town hall]] statement by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Lisa Murkowski]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from Alaska, that no version of health care reform included "death panels".

Sevugan explained the term "deathers" to [[Patricia Murphy]], who writes a ''[[Politics Daily]]'' column called "The Capitolist":

<blockquote>By "deather," I mean an opponent of change who is knowingly spreading false information regarding the existence of an alleged "death panel" in health insurance reform plans despite the fact the claim has been repeatedly and unequivocally debunked by independent fact-checking organizations. Like "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birthers]]", "deathers" are shamefully lying and trafficking in scurrilous rumors to incite fear and achieve their stated political objective of derailing the president of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/08/13/democrats-shift-criticism-from-birthers-to-deathers/|title=Democrats Shift Criticism From 'Birthers' to 'Deathers'|first=Patricia| last=Murphy|work=Politics Daily|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

Others, such as former Republican Secretary of Commerce [[Peter George Peterson|Peter G. Peterson]], have indicated that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10443|title=Peter G.

===Medical malpractice costs and limits on redress (tort)===
Critics have argued that [[medical malpractice]] costs are significant and should be addressed via [[tort reform]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/08/06/the_high_cost_of_medical_malpractice_97346.html|title=RCP-Roth-The High Cost of Medical Malpractice-August 2009}}</ref>  At the same time, a [[Hearst Newspapers]] investigation concluded that up to 200,000 people per year die from [[medical errors]] and infections in the United States.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deadbymistake/6669310.html Chron.com]</ref>  None of the three major bills under consideration lower recoverable damages in [[tort]] suits. Medical malpractice, such as doctor errors resulting in harm to patients, has several direct and indirect costs:
* jury awards to injured;
* [[workers' compensation]];
* reduced worker productivity as a result of injury;
* pain and suffering of the injured;

How much these costs are is a matter of debate. Some have argued that [[malpractice]] lawsuits are a major driver of medical costs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002816.html|title=Health Reform's Taboo Topic|author=Philip K. Howard|date=Friday, July 31, 2009 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref> However, the direct cost of malpractice suits amounts to only about 0.5% of all healthcare spending, and a 2006 Harvard study showed that over 90% of the malpractice suits examined contained evidence of injury to the patient and that [[Frivolous lawsuit|frivolous suits]] were generally readily [[Involuntary dismissal|dismissed]] by the courts.<ref name="slate11">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2145400/|title=The Medical Malpractice Myth}}</ref> A 2005 study estimated the cost around 0.2%, and in 2009 insurer WellPoint Inc. said "liability wasn’t driving premiums."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=az9qxQZNmf0o|title=Bloomberg-Malpractice Lawsuits are Red Herring in Obama Plan | date=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Counting both direct and indirect costs, other studies estimate the total cost of malpractice "is linked to" between 5% and 10% of total U.S. medical costs.<ref name="IbidBloomberg">Ibid, Bloomberg.</ref> A 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office put medical malpractice costs at 2% of U.S. health spending and "even significant reductions" would do little to reduce the growth of health-care expenses.<ref name="IbidBloomberg" />

Conservative columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]] argued that between $60–200 billion per year could be saved through tort reform. Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman [[Howard Dean]] explained why tort reform is not part of the bills under consideration: "When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/08/27/roundtable_on_health_care_reforms_costs_98082.html|title=RCP-Roundtable on Health Reform Costs-August 2009}}</ref>

However, even successful tort reform might not lead to lower aggregate liability: for example, medical commentators have argued that the current contingent fee system skews litigation towards high-value cases while ignoring meritorious small cases; aligning litigation more closely with merit might thus increase the number of small awards, offsetting any reduction in large awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/503853|title=Log in}}</ref> A New York study found that only 1.5% of hospital negligence led to claims; moreover, the CBO observed that "health care providers are generally not exposed to the financial cost of their own malpractice risk because they carry liability insurance, and the premiums for that insurance do not reflect the records or practice styles of individual providers but more-general factors such as location and medical specialty."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&type=0|title=CBO – Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice}}</ref> Given that total liability is small relative to the amount doctors pay in malpractice insurance premiums, alternative mechanisms have been proposed to reform malpractice insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physiciansnews.com/law/1202roggenbaum.html|title=Alternative malpractice insurance mechanisms}}</ref>

===Addressing the shortage of doctors, nurses and hospital capacity===
The U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. Writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', cardiologist Arthur Feldman cited various studies that indicate the U.S. is facing a "critical" shortage of doctors, including an estimated 1,300 general surgeons by 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/04/AR2009090402274.html|title=Feldman-Washington Post-Ten Things I Hate About Healthcare Reform-Sept 09 | work=The Washington Post | date=September 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

The American Academy of Family Physicians predicts a shortage of 40,000 primary care doctors (including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology) by 2020. The number of medical students choosing the primary care specialty has dropped by 52% since 1997. Currently, only 2% of medical school graduates choose primary care as a career. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a "tiny band-aid at best," advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/04/doctors-medical-health-reform-senate-opinions-contributors-marc-siegel.html |title=Forbes-The Doctor Drought-Marc Siegel-December 2009 |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=December 4, 2009}}</ref>

The American Association of Colleges of Nurses cited studies estimating that a shortage of registered nurses would reach 230,000 by 2025 as America ages, with over 135,000 open positions during 2007. An additional 30% more nurses would have to graduate annually to keep up with demand. A study by Price Waterhouse advanced several strategies for addressing the nursing shortage, including developing more public-private partnerships, federal and state-level grants for nursing students and educators, creating healthy work environments, using technology as a training tool, and designing more flexible roles for advanced practice nurses given their increased use as primary care providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/Media/FactSheets/NursingShortage.htm|title=American Association of Colleges of Nurses-Fact Sheet-Retrieved September 7, 2009}}</ref>

In addition, the U.S. also does not measure favorably vs. OECD countries in terms of acute care hospital beds. Only four OECD countries have fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than the U.S, which has 2.7 per 1,000 population versus an OECD average of 3.8. Japan has 8.2 acute care beds per 1,000 population.<ref name="forbes.com"/>

===Single-payer payment system===

[[File:Single Payer Protester.JPG|thumb|left|Costumed supporter of single-payer at an April 2009 protest in New York City.]]
{{See also|Single-payer_health_care#United_States|United States National Health Care Act}}

Although studies indicate that Democrats tend to be more supportive of a single-payer health care system than are Republicans, none of the reform bills that were debated in the US Congress when it had a Democratic party majority from 2007 to 2010 included any proposals to implement a single payer health care system. In a single payer system the government or a government regulated non-profit agency channels health care payments to collect premiums and settle the bills of medical providers instead of for-profit insurance companies. Many countries use single-payer systems to cover all their citizens.

The over 1,300 U.S. health insurance companies have different forms and processes for billing and reimbursement, requiring high costs on the part of service providers (mainly doctors and hospitals) to process payments. For example, the Cleveland Clinic, considered a low-cost, best-practices hospital system, has 1,400 billing clerks to support 2,000 doctors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/224585 |title=Newsweek-The Hospital That Could Cure Healthcare-December 7, 2009 |work=Newsweek |date=November 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Further, the insurance companies have their own overhead functions and profit margins, much of which could be eliminated with a single payer system.  Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would save $200 billion per year, primarily via insurance company overhead.<ref>{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |title=Krugman-One Nation, Uninsured-June 2005 |work=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> One advocacy group estimated savings as high as $400 billion annually for 2009 and beyond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources |title=PNHP-Single Payer |publisher=Pnhp.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

The US system is often compared with that of its northern neighbor, Canada (see [[Canadian and American health care systems compared]]). Canada's system is largely publicly funded. In 2006, Americans spent an estimated US$6,714 per capita on health care, while Canadians spent US$3,678.<ref name="OECD Canada">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf|title=OECD Health Data 2008: How Does Canada Compare|format=PDF}}</ref> This amounted to 15.3% of US GDP in that year, while Canada spent 10.0% of GDP on health care.  A study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of US health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to health care administrative costs.<ref>[http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada] Woolhandler, et al., NEJM 349(8) Sept. 21, 2003</ref>

Advocates argue that shifting the US to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. Shifting to a single-payer system would also eliminate oversight by managed care reviewers, removing a potential impediment to the doctor-patient relationship.<ref name="PNHP">Physicians for a National Health Program. [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what_is_single_payer.php "What is Single Payer?"]</ref>

Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will.<ref>[http://www.pnhp.org/news/2007/february/timid_ideas_wont_fi.php Timid ideas will not fix health mess]. By Marie Cocco, Sacramento Bee, February 10, 2007</ref>

===Privatize Medicare with a voucher system===
{{main|The Path to Prosperity}}

Rep. [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R) has proposed the ''Roadmap for America's Future'', which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ |title=Republican Website-Roadmap for America's Future |publisher=Roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/plan/charts.htm |title=Roadmap for America's Future-Charts & Graphs-February 2010 |publisher=Roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/12/AR2010021202382.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 |title=Washington Post-Robert Samuelson-Paul Ryan's Lonely Challenge-February 2010 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/02/11/cut-spending-taxes-budget-medicare-paul-ryan-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html |title=Forbes-Bartlett-Paul Ryan's Budgetary Holy Grail-February 2010 |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=February 12, 2010}}</ref> The CBO also partially scored the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf |title=CBO-Ryan Roadmap Letter-January 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Congressional Proposals for Health Care Reform==
{{update|section|date=July 2012}}
Currently, there are two major proposals being considered in Congress.

On November 7, 2009, the House passed their version of a health insurance reform bill, the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], 220–215.

On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://democrats.senate.gov/reform/patient-protection-affordable-care-act.pdf |title=Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/12/24/health.care/index.html |title=CNN-Senate Passes Healthcare Bill-December 24, 2009 |publisher=CNN |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

Republicans continue to claim that they had a workable bill to extend coverage to all Americans and not cost the taxpayer a single penny.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/health/policy/30check.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | title=Searching for Some Light Amid the Heat | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | date=January 29, 2010 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> The [[Empowering Patients First Act]] which was proposed as a replacing amendment to the Senate Bill during the bill mark-up. However, this alternative bill was rejected by the Senate Finance Committee. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10705/hr3962amendmentBoehner.pdf |title=CBO.gov |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> It does not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this is a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills.

===Similarities between the House and Senate Bills===
The two bills are similar in a number of ways. In particular, both bills:<ref>{{cite news|last=Hossain |first=Farhana |url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/19/us/politics/1119-plan-comparison.html |title=NYtimes.com |work=The New York Times |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/updated-health-care-charts |title=CRF.org |publisher=Crfb.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

* Prevent insurers selling in the exchange insurance policies that do not meet minimum coverage standards
* Prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions
* Prevent sex discrimination by insurers (especially the current discrimination against women) in setting premiums
* Limit age discrimination by insurers when setting policy premiums
* Restrict the ability of insurers to rescind policies they have been collecting premiums on
* Require insurers to cover adult children up to their mid twenties as part of family coverage
* Expand Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder (to 133% of the poverty line in the Senate bill and 150% in the House bill)
* Offer tax credits to certain small businesses (under 25 workers) who provide employees with health insurance

* Offer a new voluntary long-term care insurance program
* Pay for new spending, in part, through cutting over-generous funding (under existing law) given to private insurers that sell privatised health care plans to seniors (so called [[Medicare Advantage]] plans), slowing the growth of Medicare provider payments {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, reducing Medicare and Medicaid drug prices {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, cutting other Medicare and Medicaid spending through better reward structures, and raising taxes on very generous health care packages (typically offered to senior executives) and penalties on larger firms not providing their employees with health care coverage and certain persons who do not buy health insurance.
* Impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to a flexible spending account (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits, to pay for health care reform costs.

===Differences in the House and Senate Bills===
The biggest difference between the bills, currently, is in how they are financed. In addition to the items listed in the above bullet point, the House relies mainly on a surtax on income above $500,000 ($1 million for families). The Senate, meanwhile, relies largely on an "excise tax" for high cost '[[Cadillac insurance plan|Cadillac]]' insurance plans, as well as an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for high earners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_healthcareproposals_20090912.html |title=Wallstreet Journal online |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/updated-health-care-charts |title=CRFB.org |publisher=CRFB.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

Most economists believe the excise tax to be best of the three revenue raisers above, since (due to health care cost growth) it would grow fast enough to more than keep up with new coverage costs, and it would help to put downward pressure on overall health care cost growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/understanding-health-insurance-excise-tax |title=CRFB.org |publisher=CRFB.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/taxing-health-care-decisions |title=CRFB.org |publisher=CRFB.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>  In contrast, the House bill's [[health insurance mandate|insurance mandate]] has been described as "an economic assault on the young" by, for example, [[Robert J. Samuelson]] for [[The Washington Post]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/22/AR2009112201237.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Robert J. Samuelson on the health bill's burdens for the young | date=November 23, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill would also include a [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/07/17/IMACUBend/ Medicare Commission] which could modify Medicare payments in order to keep down cost growth.

Services marketed as [[preventive care]] are a subject of continuing debate. Years of [[evidence-based medicine|study]] have shown that most common services provide no benefit to patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002934306011879 |title=Linkinghub.elsevier.com |publisher=Linkinghub.elsevier.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/health/annual-physical-checkup-may-be-an-empty-ritual.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Annual Physical Checkup May Be an Empty Ritual | first=Gina | last=Kolata | date=August 12, 2003 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>  The House and Senate bills would mandate the purchase of policies that pay 100% of the cost of certain services, with no co-pay; when the Senate bill was amended to mandate paying for tests that a federal [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|panel]] and [[U.S. News & World Report]] said "do more harm than good,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/cancer/2009/11/16/routine-mammograms-before-50-not-much-point.html |title=Health.usnews.com |publisher=Health.usnews.com |date=November 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> [[The New York Times]] wrote, "This sorry episode does not bode well for reform efforts to rein in spending on other procedures based on sound scientific evidence of their potential benefits and risks for patients."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/opinion/06sun1.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Senate Health Care Follies | date=December 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

====Differences in how each chamber determines subsidies====
<!--I gleaned all of the subsidy information directly from the bills. Feel free to edit it. I'll keep myself posted and notice any chances.-->
[[File:Percentage of income allotted to pay for health insurance vs. federal poverty level for house and senate.jpg|thumb|right|upright=3|alt=A graphic that demonstrates how the subsidies are more generous for those closer to the poverty line and drop off as a family's distance from the poverty line increases. The rate at which the subsidy falls off decreases with increased distance from the poverty line. The curve representative of the "house bill" is concave and has a negative second derivative. The curve representative of the "senate bill" is linear from 100% FPL to 300% FPL and then flattens out at 9.8% of annual income until 400% FPL.|The relationship between a family's [[federal poverty level|poverty level]] and the percentage of their income that is allotted to pay for health insurance. Note that the Senate Bill provides for Medicaid coverage up to 133% of the federal poverty level while the House Bill provides for Medicaid coverage up to 150% of the federal poverty level. Adapted from the texts of the House Bill and Senate Bill.]]
How each bill determines subsidies also differs. Each bill subsidizes the cost of the premium and the out-of-pocket costs but are more or less generous based on the relationship of the family's income to the federal poverty level.

The amount of the subsidy given to a family to cover the cost of a premium is calculated using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.
To understand how each bill can affect different poverty levels and incomes, see the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]'s [http://healthreform.kff.org/SubsidyCalculator.aspx subsidy calculator]

=====Subsidies Under House Bill=====
<!--I gleaned all of the subsidy information directly from the bills. Feel free to edit it. I'll keep myself posted and notice any chances.-->
The House plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses.
The cost of the plan is subsidized according to the family's poverty level, decreasing the subsidy as the poverty level approaches 400%.
The out-of-pocket expenses are also subsidized according to the poverty level at the following rates. The out-of-pocket expenses are subsidized initially and are not allowed to exceed a particular amount that will rise with the premiums for basic insurance.

=====Subsidies Under Senate Bill=====
<!--I gleaned all of the subsidy information directly from the bills. Feel free to edit it. I'll keep myself posted and notice any chances.-->
The Senate plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses.
The cost of the plan is subsidized according to the family's poverty level, decreasing the subsidy as the [[federal poverty level|poverty level]] approaches 400%.
The out-of-pocket expenses are also subsidized according to the poverty level at the following rates. The out-of-pocket expenses are subsidized initially and are not allowed to exceed a particular amount that will rise with the premiums for basic insurance.

|200% and 300% of the [[federal poverty level|FPL]]||50%
|-
|300% and 400% of the [[federal poverty level|FPL]]||33%
|}

The Senate Bill also seeks to reduce out-of-pocket costs by setting guidelines for how much of the health costs can be shifted to a family within 200% of the poverty line. A family within 150% of the FPL cannot have more than 10% of their health costs incurred as out-of-pocket expenses. A family between 150% and 200% of the FPL cannot have more than 20% of their health costs incurred as out-of-pocket expenses.

<!--I gleaned all of the subsidy information directly from the bills. Feel free to edit it. I'll keep myself posted and notice any chances.-->
The House and Senate bill would differ, somewhat, in their overall impact. The Senate bill would cover an additional 31 million people, at a federal budget cost of nearly $850 billion (not counting unfunded mandates) over ten years, reduce the ten-year deficit by $130 billion, and reduce the deficit in the second decade by around 0.25% of GDP. The House bill, meanwhile, would cover an additional 36 million people, cost roughly $1050 billion in coverage provisions, reduce the ten-year deficit by $138 billion, and slightly reduce the deficit in the second decade.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Commentary on the cost analysis===
It is worth noting that both bills rely on a number of "gimmicks" to get their favorable deficit reduction numbers. For example, both institute a public long-term care insurance known as the CLASS Act – because this insurance has a 5-year vesting period, it will appear to raise revenue in the first decade, even though all the money will need to be paid back. If the CLASS Act is subtracted from the bills, the Senate bill would reduce the deficit by $57 billion over ten years, and the House by $37 billion. In addition to the CLASS Act, neither bill accounts for the costs of updating Medicare physician payments, even though the House [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/712775 did so on a deficit-financed basis] shortly after passing their health care bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/true-costs-health-reform |title=CRFB.org |publisher=CRFB.org |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

The Senate bill also begins most provisions a year later than the House bill in order to make costs seem smaller:

Surgeon [[Atul Gawande]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that the Senate and House bills passed contain a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. He argued that a trial and error strategy, combined with industry and government partnership, is how the U.S. overcame a similar challenge in the agriculture industry in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all |title=Gawande-Testing, Testing-New Yorker-December 2009 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

The health and insurance sectors gave nearly $170 million to House and Senate members in 2007 and 2008, with 54% going to Democrats, according to data compiled by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]]. The shift in parties was even more pronounced during the first three months of 2009, when Democrats collected 60% of the $5.4 million donated by health-care companies and their employees, the data show. Lawmakers that chair key committees have been leading recipients, some of whom received over $1.0 million in contributions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/20/AR2009072003363.html?hpid=topnews&sid=ST2009072003679|title=Washington Post-Dan Eggen-Industry Cash Flowed to Drafters of Reform-July 2009 | work=The Washington Post | date=July 21, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

[[Matt Taibbi]] wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that President Obama and key senators who have advocated single-payer systems in the past are unwilling to face the insurance companies and their powerful lobbying efforts. Key politicians on the Senate Finance Committee involved in crafting legislation have received over $2 million in campaign contributions from the healthcare industry. Several of the firms invited to testify at the hearings sent lobbyists that had formerly worked for Senator [[Max Baucus]], the chair of the committee. Mr. Baucus stated in February 2009 that: "There may come a time when we can push for single-payer. At this time, it's not going to get to first base in Congress."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/29988909/sick_and_wrong|title=Taibbi-Rolling Stone-Sick and Wrong-September 2009}}</ref>

[[George McGovern]] wrote that significant campaign funds were given to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health-care legislation: "Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, and his political action committee have received nearly $4 million from the health-care lobby since 2003. The ranking Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa, has received more than $2 million. It's a mistake for one politician to judge the personal motives of another. But Sens. Baucus and Grassley are firm opponents of the single-payer system, as are other highly placed members of Congress who have been generously rewarded by the insurance lobby."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091102406.html|title=McGovern Op Ed-Washington Post-September 2009 | work=The Washington Post | first=George S. | last=McGovern | date=September 13, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

==Debate about political organizing methods==
Much of the coverage of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the [[Tea Party protests|Tea Party protest phenomenon]], with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it.<ref name="Bowser">{{cite news|first=Andre|last=Bowser|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/143354|title=TEA Party protests health care reform plan|work=East Valley Tribune|date=August 22, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="Copeland">{{cite news|url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/content/news/stories/2009/08/15/08152009wacteapartyprotest.html?imw=Y|work=Waco Tribune|title=Local Tea Party members protest Obama health care plan at Chet Edwards' Waco office|date=August 15, 2009|first=Mike|last=Copeland|accessdate=August 26, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=summer/> Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance [[public relations|PR]] executive [[Wendell Potter]] of the [[Center for Media and Democracy]]- whose funding comes from groups such as the [[Tides Foundation]]-<ref name="financial">{{cite web | url = http://www.prwatch.org/finances.html | title = Financial Supporters | publisher = [[Center for Media and Democracy]] | accessdate =June 3, 2008 }}</ref> argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate [[astroturfing]], which he says that he used to write for [[CIGNA]].<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Wendell Potter]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/17/potter.health.insurance/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|title=Commentary: How insurance firms drive debate|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 26, 2009|date=August 17, 2009}}</ref> Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of [[Americans for Prosperity]]- whose funding comes mainly from the [[Koch Industries]] corporation-<ref>[http://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/outside_groups/americans_for_prosperity/ Secret Money Project].

==Arguments concerning health care reform==
===Liberal arguments===
Some have argued that health care is a fundamental human right. Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services."<ref>Judith Asher, [http://shr.aaas.org/manuals/health/Manual_7.pdf "Chapter 2 What is meant by the right to health?"] ''The [[Right to health|Right to Health]]: A Resource Manual for NGOs'', AAAS Science and Human Rights Program, 1200 New York Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20005, site updated April 25, 2005.</ref> Similarly, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] advocated a right to medical care in his 1944 proposal for a [[Second Bill of Rights]].<ref>Franklin D. Roosevelt, “[http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/globalrights/econrights/fdr-econbill.html "The Economic Bill of Rights”] Excerpt from January 11, 1944, message to Congress on the State of the Union.</ref>

Liberals were the primary advocates of both [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], which are often targeted as significant expansions of government that has overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10172473?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=1|title=Medicare beneficiaries rate their medical care: new data from the MCBS (Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey)|publisher=Health Care Financ Rev.|author=Adler GS.}}</ref> President Obama argued during a September 2009 joint session of Congress that the government has a moral responsibility to ensure quality healthcare is available to all citizens. He also referred to a letter from the late Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/The-Presidents-Remarks-and-a-Letter-from-Ted/|title=President Obama Healthcare Speech of September 9, 2009|first=Jesse|last=Lee|date=September 9, 2009}}</ref>

Economist and New York Times columnist [[Paul Krugman]] has argued that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: "At this point, the guiding principle of one of our nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think something might be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America." He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is "utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. (Honest.) In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. And in recent years, Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in entitlement spending – growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/opinion/05krugman.html?_r=1&hp=&pagewanted=print|title=NYT-Krugman-The Politics of Spite-October 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=October 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>  More recently he urged the House of representatives to pass the Senate's bill, which he called "centrist."<ref>{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/opinion/22krugman.html |title=Krugman-NYT-Do The Right Thing-January 21, 2010 |work=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Conservative and libertarian arguments===
Conservatives and libertarians have historically argued for a lesser role of government in healthcare.

For example, Conservative GOP columnist [[Bill Kristol]] advocated several free-market reforms instead of the Clinton plan during the 1993–1994 period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v2n1/kristol.html|title=WSJ-William Kristol-How to Oppose the Health Plan and Why-January 1994}}</ref> Investigative reporter and columnist [[John Stossel]] has remarked that "Insurance invites waste. That's a reason health care costs so much, and is often so consumer-unfriendly. In the few areas where there are free markets in health care – such as cosmetic medicine and Lasik eye surgery – customer service is great, and prices continue to drop."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[John Stossel]]|title= Health Insurance Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PrescriptionForChange/story?id=2574980&page=1|date=October 16, 2006|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> Republican Senator and medical doctor [[Tom Coburn]] has stated that the [[Health care in Switzerland|healthcare system in]] Switzerland should serve as a model for U.S. reform. He wrote for ''[[New York Sun]]'' that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/competition-solves-health-care/72610/|work=[[New York Sun]]|title=Competition Solves Health Care|author=[[Tom Coburn]]|date=March 10, 2008}}</ref>

Some critics of the bills passed in 2009 call them a "government take over of health care."<ref>[http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=141996 Republicanleader.house.gov]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> [[FactCheck]] called the phrase an unjustified "mantra."<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted on |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/11/the-government-run-mantra/ |title=Factcheck.org |publisher=Factcheck.org |date=November 6, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> (Factcheck has also criticized a number of other assertions made during 2009 by advocates on both sides of the debate).<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted on |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/whoppers-of-2009/ |title=Factcheck.org |publisher=Factcheck.org |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> [[CBS News]] described it as a myth "mixed in with some real causes for concern."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/27/health/main5269260.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Fighting Myths of Health Care "Takeover" | date=August 27, 2009}}</ref>  President Obama disputes the notion of a government takeover and says he no more wants government bureaucrats meddling than he wants insurance company bureaucrats doing so.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/08/68496680/1 | work=USA Today | title=Obama: No government bureaucrats – or insurance bureaucrats | date=August 11, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010 | first=David | last=Jackson}}</ref>{{verify credibility|date=January 2010}}  However, other sources contend the bills do amount to either a government takeover or a corporate takeover, or both.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/obamanomics-and-health-care/ | work=The New York Times | title=Obamanomics and Health Care | first=Ross | last=Douthat | date=December 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/A-corporate-takeover-of-healthcare-AND-a-government-takeover-79611517.html |title=Washingtonexaminer.com |publisher=Washingtonexaminer.com |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10576 |title=Cato.org |publisher=Cato.org |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.heritage.org/2009/11/04/the-government-takeover-of-health-care-in-pictures/ |title=Heritage.org blog |publisher=Blog.heritage.org |date=November 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Andrew C |title=Amazon.com |publisher=Amazon.com |asin=1594034605}}</ref>  This debate occurs in the context of a "revolution...transforming how medical care is delivered:" from 2002 to 2008, the percentage of medical practices owned by doctors fell from more than 70% to below 50%; in contrast to the traditional practice in which most doctors cared for patients in small, privately owned clinics, by 2008 most doctors had become employees of hospitals, nearly all of which are owned by corporations or government.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/health/policy/26docs.html?src=me&ref=homepage | work=The New York Times | title=More Doctors Giving Up Private Practices | first=Gardiner | last=Harris | date=March 25, 2010 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

Senator [[Judd Gregg]] (R) said in an interview regarding the passage of healthcare reform: "Well, in my judgment we’re moving down a path towards... Europeanization of our nation.  And our great uniqueness, what surrounds American exceptionalism, what really drives it is that entrepreneurial individualistic spirit which goes out and takes a risk when nobody else is willing to do it or comes up with an idea that nobody else comes up with and that all gets dampened down the larger and more intrusive government becomes, especially if you follow a European model."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10928 |title=Charlie Rose-Senator Judd Gregg Interview-March 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>
