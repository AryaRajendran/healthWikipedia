'''Type I cytokine receptors''' are [[transmembrane receptors]] expressed on the surface of cells that recognize and respond to [[cytokine]]s with four [[alpha helix|α-helical]] strands.  These receptors are also known under the name ''[[hemopoietin]] receptors'', and share a common [[amino acid]] motif (WSXWS) in the extracellular portion adjacent to the cell membrane.  Members of the type I cytokine receptor family comprise different chains, some of which are involved in [[ligand]]/cytokine interaction and others that are involved in [[signal transduction]].  

==Signal transduction chains==
The signal transducing chains are often shared between different receptors within this receptor family.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0008-5">{{cite book | author = Lichtman, Andrew H.; Abbas, Abul K. | title = Cellular and molecular immunology | publisher = Saunders | location = Philadelphia | year = 2003 | edition =  5th | pages = | isbn = 0-7216-0008-5 | oclc = | doi = }}</ref>
