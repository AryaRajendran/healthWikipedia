The '''2009 Bolivian dengue fever epidemic''' was an [[epidemic]] of [[dengue fever]] which struck the [[South America]]n country of [[Bolivia]] in early 2009, escalating into a national emergency by February. The [[BBC]] described it as the worst outbreak of dengue fever in the country's history. At least 18 people died and 31,000 were infected by the [[mosquito]]-transmitted arbovirus.

On 20 February, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] reported that eighty (80) cases of the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever had occurred in Bolivia since January, of which 22% were fatal.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> Bolivia requested outside assistance and foreign aid.

== Mosquito transmission ==
Mosquitoes thrive in the high temperatures and humidity of the Bolivian lowlands and it was that region which saw the highest numbers of infected civilians.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> There is currently no vaccine for dengue fever.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> Those infected experience flu-like symptoms such as severe headaches, fevers and joint pain.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> The infected are advised by medical experts to drink lots of fluids and obtain significant rest.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> Dengue fever sufferers have an approximate 1% chance of progressing to the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> Symptoms for such a progression include [[hypothermia]], vomiting, severe abdominal pain and confusion.
