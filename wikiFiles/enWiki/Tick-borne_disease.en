'''Tick-borne diseases''' are [[disease]]s or illnesses [[Vector (epidemiology)|transmitted by]] [[tick]]s. As the incidence of tick-borne illnesses increases and the geographic areas in which they are found expand, it becomes increasingly important that health professionals be able to distinguish the diverse, and often overlapping, clinical presentations of these diseases.

Tick-borne illnesses are caused by infection with a variety of [[pathogen]]s, including [[rickettsia]] and other types of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and [[protozoa]]. Because ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent, patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time, compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
In general, specific laboratory tests are not available to rapidly diagnose tick-borne diseases. Due to their seriousness, [[antibiotic]] treatment is often justified based on clinical presentation alone.

==Exposure==
Ticks tend to be more active during warmer months, though this varies by geographic region and climate. Areas with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Those bitten commonly experience symptoms such as body aches, [[fever]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[joint pain]], or [[rash]]es. People can limit their exposure to tick bites by wearing light-colored clothing (including pants and long sleeves), using [[insect repellent]] with 20%–30% [[DEET]], tucking their pant legs into their socks, checking for ticks frequently, and washing and drying their clothing (in a hot dryer).<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/tick-borne/ Tick-Borne Diseases].

Another natural form of control for ticks is the guineafowl, a bird species which consumes mass quantities of ticks. So good animal husbandry can reduce tick prevalence in a high tick prevalence area.

Major tick-borne diseases include:

===Bacteria===
* [[Lyme disease]] or [[Borreliosis]]
**Organism: ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi|Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato]]'' (bacterium)
**Vector: deer tick (''Ixodes scapularis'' (=''I. dammini''), ''I. pacificus'', ''I. ricinus'' (Europe), ''I. persulcatus'' (Asia))
**Endemic to: North America and Eurasia
**Symptoms: [[Fever]], [[arthritis]], neuroborreliosis, [[erythema migrans]], cranial nerve palsy, [[carditis]], fatigue, and influenza-like illness.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/lyme-disease/DS00116/DSECTION=symptoms Lyme disease: Symptoms - MayoClinic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*[[Relapsing fever]] (Tick-borne relapsing fever, different from [[Lyme disease]] due to different Borrelia species and ticks)
**Organisms: ''[[Borrelia]] species'' Such as Borrelia hermsii, Borrelia parkeri, Borrelia duttoni, Borrelia miyamotoi
**Vector: ''Ornithodoros species''
**Regions : Primarily in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia in and certain areas of Canada and the western United States
**Symptoms: Relapsing fever typically presents as recurring high fevers, headaches, and muscular pain, with less common symptoms including [[rigors]], joint pain, altered mentation, cough, painful urination, and rash.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/227272-overview Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
**Treatment: antibiotics are the treatment for relapsing fever, with doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin being the treatment of choice.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/227272-treatment Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*[[Typhus]] Several diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria (below).

**Symptoms:Fever, headache, [[altered mental status]], [[myalgia]], and [[rash]]<ref name=autogenerated1>https://health.google.com/health/ref/Rocky+Mountain+spotted+fever</ref>
**Treatment: [[Antibiotic]] therapy, typically consisting of doxycycline or tetracycline.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
*[[Rickettsia helvetica|Helvetica Spotted fever]]

**Symptoms:Most often small red spots, other symptoms are fever, muscle pain, headache and respiratory problems<ref name=Lindblom2012>{{Cite pmid|22961007}}</ref>
