A '''hybrid cardiac surgical procedure''' in a narrow sense is defined as a procedure that combines a conventional surgical part (including a skin incision) with an interventional part, using some sort of [[catheter]]-based procedure guided by [[fluoroscopy]] (or other, e.g. [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]]) imaging in a [[hybrid operating room|hybrid OR]] without interruption. A wider definition includes a clinically connected succession of a catheter intervention and a surgical procedure with a time gap.<ref name="nollert">Nollert, G.; Wich, S.; Figel, A. (2010).

===Coronary artery disease===

====Hybrid revascularization approach====

Surgical [[bypass grafting]] and percutaneous coronary artery revascularization are traditionally considered isolated options. A simultaneous hybrid approach may allow an opportunity to match the best strategy for a particular anatomic [[lesion]]. [[Revascularization]] of the [[left anterior descending artery]] with the [[Internal thoracic artery|left internal mammary artery]] is by far the best treatment option in terms of long term results. Integrating this therapy with percutaneous coronary [[angioplasty]] (hybrid procedure) offers multi-vessel revascularization through a [[mini-thoracotomy]]. Particularly in high risk patients, [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] decreases in comparison to conventional [[surgery]].<ref name="kon">Kon, Z.; Brown, E.; Tran, R.; Joshi, A.; Reicher, B.; Grant, M.C.; Kallam, S.; Burris, N.; Connerney, I.; Zimrin, D. & Poston, R.S. (2008). Simultaneous hybrid coronary revascularization reduces postoperative morbidity compared with results from conventional off-pump coronary artery bypass.

Simultaneous hybrid revascularization versus off-pump coronary artery bypass for multivessel coronary artery disease. TheAnnals of Thoracic Surgery, Vol.91, pp. 432–439</ref> reports on 104 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who were compared with the same sized group of patients undergoing [[Off-pump coronary artery bypass|off pump surgery]] using [[propensity score matching]]. The patients treated with the hybrid approach had a significantly shorter [[intensive care unit]] stay and intubation time and experienced less complications in terms of bleeding and transfusions needs. At a median follow up of 18 months, patients undergoing the hybrid procedure also had a significantly higher freedom from major adverse cardiac or [[cerebrovascular]] events (99% vs. 90.4%; p = 0.03). The hybrid procedure was also less costly than an exclusively [[percutaneous]] strategy.

====Completion angiography====

For a patient who underwent [[coronary artery bypass grafting]], coronary imaging (completion [[angiography]]) for the routine evaluation of the [[bypass graft]]s is reasonable, as the one-year re-occlusion rate is at 20%. Thereby, defected implantations may be detected. In a study designed and published by the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute,<ref name="zhao">Zhao, D.X.; Leacche, M.; Balaguer, J.M.; Boudoulas, K.D.; Damp, J.A.; Greelish, J.P. & Byrne, J.G. (2009). Routine Intraoperative Completion Angiography After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting and 1-Stop Hybrid Revascularization Results From a Fully Integrated Hybrid Catheterization Laboratory/Operating Room. Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Vol.53, No.3, (January 2009), pp. 232–241
</ref> routine intraoperative completion angiography performed in a fully functional [[hybrid operating room]] detected important defects in 97 of 796 (12% of the grafts) venous coronary artery bypass grafts in 366 adult patients (14% of the patients) with complex coronary artery disease. Their findings in completion angiography at the end of the operation included suboptimal anatomies, poor positioning of the venous [[bypass graft]], and bypasses to not diseased vessels. Consequently, these defects, which usually would be detected at follow-up, could be rectified immediately, through traditional surgical revision or [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s, resulting in optimal bypass outcomes.<ref name="intech" />

===Pediatric cardiac surgery===
For [[congenital]] cardiac malformations, even though surgery remains the treatment of choice, [[interventional cardiology]] approaches are increasingly being used. However, such percutaneous approaches can be challenging or even impossible because of difficult and complex anatomies (such as double-outlet right ventricle, or transposition of the great arteries, acute turns or kinks in the pulmonary arteries of [[tetralogy of Fallot]] patients) and patient characteristics/ complications (low weight, poor vascular access, induced rhythm disturbances, hemodynamic compromise).<ref name="bacha">Bacha E.A.; Daves, S.; Hardin, J.; Abdulla, R.I.; Anderson, J.; Kahana, M.; Koenig, P.; Mora, B.N.; Gulecyuz, M.; Starr, J.P.; Alboliras, E.; Sandhu, S. & Hijazi, Z.M.

The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Vol.131, No.1, (January 2006), pp. 163-171, PII S0022-5223(05)01370-X</ref><ref name="sivakumar">Sivakumar, K.; Krishnan, P.; Pieris, R. & Francis, E.

Catheterization Cardiovascular Interventions, Vol.70, No.2, (August 2007), pp. 256-264</ref> Nevertheless, surgery has its limitations, so that combining interventions and surgery into a single therapeutic procedure potentially leads to reduction of complexity, cardiopulmonary bypass time, risk, and to improved outcomes.
Another important concept in hybrid procedures is completion [[angiography]], as described above, which in the case of [[congenital heart disease]] surgery may detect residual structural lesions, thus reduce postoperative complications. Again, 3D imaging using [[rotational angiography]] should be the concept of choice.<ref name="holzer">Holzer, R.J.; Sisk, M.; Chisolm, J.L.; Hill, S.L.; Olshove V.; Phillips, A.; Cheatham, J.P. & Galantowicz, M.

===Transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI)===
The conventional approach for treatment of [[aortic valve stenosis]] is surgical replacement of the [[aortic valve]]. This procedure has excellent outcomes particularly in younger patients at relatively low-risk and will remain the gold standard for aortic valve replacement in the upcoming years. However, [[TAVI]] (transcatheter aortic valve implantation) has emerged as a valid alternative for patients in whom conventional surgical techniques are considered too invasive and risky. The Partner trial <ref name="leon">Leon, M.B.; Smith, C.R.; Mack, M. et al.; for the PARTNER Trial Investigators (2010). Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation for aortic stenosis in patients who cannot undergo surgery. The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol.363, No.17, (October 2011), pp. 1597–1607</ref> using the Edwards Sapien valve demonstrated that patients with severe [[aortic stenosis]], who are not eligible for conventional aortic valve replacement because of too high risk, benefit significantly from TAVI in comparison to standard therapy including [[valvuloplasty]] at one year in terms of survival (Cohort B,<ref name="leon" />). In addition, 700 enrolled very high risk patients undergoing TAVI for severe [[aortic stenosis]] had comparable mortality rates to those receiving conventional aortic valve replacements at one year (Cohort A, 25% vs. 26%). The [[transfemoral]] approach was used on approximately two-thirds of TAVI patients, while the [[transapical]] approach was used in the remaining third, unlike Cohort B where only the transfemoral approach was used.

To put this approach into practice, a [[hybrid OR]] is strongly recommended by a number of professional associations, including the [[European Society of Cardiology]], the European Association of Cardio-thoracic Surgery,<ref name="vahanian">Vahanian, A.; Alfieri, O.R.; Al-Attar, N. et al. (2008). Transcatheter valve implantation for patients with aortic stenosis: a position statement from the European Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), in collaboration with the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI). European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Vol.34, No.1, (July 2008), pp. 1-8</ref> the German Society of Cardiology, and the German Society of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery.

In terms of necessary devices, currently two valves, the Corevalve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and the Sapien valve (Edwards, Irvine, CA) have been granted [[CE mark]] in 2007 and are successfully being implanted. Several newer generation valves aim to improve the results by more sophisticated designs to decrease the common current TAVI complications of [[aortic regurgitation]], misplacement, and [[heart block]].

Advanced image guidance by dedicated 2D and 3D applications (e.g. syngo Aortic Valve guide, Siemens; Heart Navigator, Philips; CTHV, Paieon) may further simplify navigation and deployment of the devices. Some of the new TAVI valves (e.g. Symetis Accurate, Jena Valve, Embracer, Medtronic) have dedicated mechanisms to anchor in the [[Aortic sinus|sinuses]], thus are designed to align with the patient anatomy. Therefore, anatomically correct rotation of the valve within the [[aortic annulus]] is needed to optimally deploy the devices. 3D imaging may prove highly valuable to understand the correct relationships between the valve and the annulus.<ref name="intech" />

===Mitral valve repair===
The repair of a defected mitral valve is a potential future hybrid procedure, that is still dependent on approval of the necessary devices by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Some of these devices also will most likely be used for procedures performed in regular [[cath lab]]s. Further prostheses for mitral und [[tricuspid valve]] replacement are under development and certainly will be available within the next years. Complex hybrid procedures may arise where the various parts of the mitral valve apparatus (e.g. [[Mitral valve|chordae]], [[Mitral valve|leaflet]] and [[Mitral valve|ring]]) are repaired on a beating heart in combination with purely interventional techniques (e.g. MitralClip). From an imaging modality perspective, fluoroscopy will most likely be combined with 2D and 3D [[ultrasound]] and a fusion of these modalities may become helpful. The reason is that the metal devices are optimally imaged without artifacts by fluoroscopy whereas the valve itself is better evaluated with [[ultrasound]]. As an alternative to [[transesophageal echocardiography]], the use of intracardiac 2D and 3D echo may prove useful because it would allow avoiding [[general anesthesia]] in selected patients.<ref name="intech" />

===Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)===
For [[aneurysms]] of the [[thoracic aorta]], [[thoracic endovascular aortic repair]] (TEVAR) has become a valid alternative to open repair. This method may even be applied to [[pathologies]] of the [[aortic arch]] and the [[Arterial tree|distal descending aorta]].<ref name="walsh">Walsh, S.R.; Tang, T.Y.; Sadat, U.; Naik, J.; Gaunt, M.E.; Boyle, J.R.; Hayes, P.D. & Varty, K. (2008). Endovascular stenting versus open surgery for thoracic aortic disease: systematic review and metaanalysis of the results. Journal of Vascular Surgery, Vol.47, No.5, (May 2008), pp. 1094-1098, PII S0741-5214(07)01592-3</ref> A common complication of [[EVAR]] are endoleaks. These may be missed by 2D angiographic evaluation. Rotational angiography, providing CT-like 3D imaging with the angiographic C-arm enables the surgeon to diagnose this complication intraoperatively and correct it right away. This has been demonstrated in a study by the University of London:<ref name="biasi">Biasi, L.; Ali, T.; Ratnam, L.A.; Morgan, R.; Loftus, I. & Thompson, M. (2009). Intra-operative 45 DynaCT improves technical success of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Journal of Vascular Surgery, Vol.49, No.2, (1 February 2009), pp. 288-295, 2 PII S0741-5214(08)01597-8</ref> In 5 of 80 patients undergoing EVAR, endoleaks that were not visible in 2D angiography could be detected by intra-operative rotational angiography. In addition, conventional [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] evaluations before discharge did not reveal any [[Endovascular aneurysm repair|endoleak]] which was not previously seen in 3D [[rotational angiography]]. In addition, the environment of the [[hybrid operating room]] allowed for immediate treatment of the endoleaks, if required. In the near future, off the shelf fenestrated aortic stents will become available for the treatment of extensive aortic disease. These fenestrated stents have to be rotated in the aorta, such that the fenestrations cover the branches of the aorta. For these highly complex procedures, 3D imaging in a [[hybrid operating room]] may be extremely helpful for the navigation of wires and devices.<ref name="intech" />

===Surgery for rhythm disturbances===
With regards to rhythm disturbances, in particular [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF), a hybrid procedure involves the combination of the surgical [[epicardial]] approach with the interventional [[endocardial]] approach. The advantages of such a combined approach have been reported by first studies, in one of them <ref name="krul">Krul, S.P.; Driessen, A.H.; van Boven, W.J.; Linnenbank, A.C.; Geuzebroek, G.S.; Jackman, W.M.; Wilde, A.A.; de Bakker, J.M. & de Groot, J.R. (14.04.2011). Thoracoscopic Video-Assisted Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation, Ganglionated Plexus Ablation and Periprocedural Confirmation of Ablation Lesions. First Results of a Hybrid Surgical-Electrophysiological Approach for Atrial Fibrillation, In:Circulation: Arrhythmia Electrophysiology,In Press</ref> 31 AF patients were treated, therof 13 with persistent and two with permanent AF using a minimally-invasive approach combining [[thoracoscopic pulmonary vein isolation]] (PVI) and [[ganglionated plexus (GP) ablation]] with intraoperative electrophysiological confirmation of PVI in order to decrease recurrences of AF during follow-up. At one year follow-up, an encouraging 86% of the patients were without reoccurrence with AF. There are not only first results available for atrial fibrillation, but also for treating drug-refractory [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] [[tachycardia]]. In one study,<ref name="michowitz">Michowitz, Y.; Mathuria, N.; Tung, R.; Esmailian, F.; Kwon, M.; Nakahara, S.; Bourke, T.; Boyle, N.G.; Mahajan, A. & Shivkumar, K. (2010). Hybrid procedures for epicardial catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia: value of surgical access. Heart Rhythm, Vol.7, No.11, (November 2010), pp. 1635-1643, PII S1547-5271(10)00700-9</ref> 14 patients (most of them after previous cardiac surgery) underwent surgical [[ablation]] with an [[epicardial]] approach with concomitant [[electrophysiological]] mapping. The authors conclude that the surgical access with [[subxiphoid window]] and limited anterior [[thoracotomy]] in the [[electrophysiology]] lab is feasible and safe. [[Cardiac pacemaker|Pacemaker]]s and [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|implantable cardioverter defibrillators]] (ICD), particularly bi-ventricular systems, may be optimally implanted in a [[hybrid OR]] environment, because the hybrid operating theatre offers the required superior angulation and imaging capabilities in comparison to mobile [[C-Arm]]s, and the higher hygienic standards compared to [[cath lab]]s. [[Rotational angiography]] (3D imaging) may prove useful for imaging the venous system of the heart. The [[coronary sinus]] can be depicted in 3D and than be overlaid over the [[fluoroscopy]] image to better guide placement of the left ventricular lead.<ref name="intech" />
