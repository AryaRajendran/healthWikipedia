'''Histology''' (compound of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words: {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἱστός|ἱστός]]}} "tissue", and -{{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:λογία|λογία]]}} [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]) is the study of the [[anatomy|microscopic anatomy]] of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. It is commonly performed by examining cells and tissues by sectioning and staining, followed by examination under a [[light microscope]] or [[electron microscope]]. Histological studies may be conducted via [[tissue culture]], where live cells can be isolated and maintained in a proper environment outside the body for various research projects. The ability to visualize or differentially identify microscopic structures is frequently enhanced through the use of histological stains. Histology is an essential tool of [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. 

''[[Histopathology]],'' the microscopic study of diseased tissue, is an important tool in [[anatomical pathology]], since accurate diagnosis of [[cancer]] and other diseases usually requires histopathological examination of samples. Trained physicians, frequently [[board certified|board-certified]] as [[pathologist]]s, are the personnel who perform histopathological examination and provide diagnostic information based on their observations.   

The trained scientists who perform the preparation of histological sections are ''histotechnicians,'' histology technicians (HT), histology technologists (HTL), medical scientists, [[Medical Laboratory Assistant|medical laboratory technicians]], or [[biomedical scientist]]s.  Their field of study is called ''histotechnology.''

===Fixing ===

====Chemical fixation with formaldehyde or other chemicals ====
{{main|Fixation (histology)}}
Chemical fixatives are used to preserve tissue from degradation, and to maintain the structure of the cell and of sub-cellular components such as cell organelles (e.g., nucleus, [[endoplasmic reticulum]], mitochondria). The most common fixative for light microscopy is 10% neutral buffered formalin (4% [[formaldehyde]] in [[phosphate buffered saline]]). For electron microscopy, the most commonly used fixative is [[glutaraldehyde]], usually as a 2.5% solution in [[phosphate buffered saline]]. These fixatives preserve tissues or cells mainly by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. The main action of these aldehyde fixatives is to cross-link amino groups in proteins through the formation of [[methylene bridge]]s (-CH<sub>2</sub>-), in the case of formaldehyde, or by a C5H10 cross-links in the case of glutaraldehyde. This process, while preserving the structural integrity of the cells and tissue can damage the biological functionality of proteins, particularly [[enzymes]], and can also [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] them to a certain extent. This can be detrimental to certain histological techniques. Further fixatives are often used for electron microscopy such as [[osmium tetroxide]] or [[uranyl acetate]]

Formalin fixation leads to degradation of mRNA, miRNA and DNA in tissues. However, extraction, amplification and analysis of these nucleic acids from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is possible using appropriate protocols.<ref name=Klopfleisch>{{cite journal |author=Weiss AT, Delcour NM, Meyer A, Klopfleisch R. |title=Efficient and Cost-Effective Extraction of Genomic DNA From Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded Tissues |journal=Veterinary Pathology |volume=227 |issue= 4|pages= 834–8|year=2010 |pmid=20817894 |doi=10.1177/0300985810380399}}</ref>

====Frozen section fixation ====
[[Frozen section]] is a rapid way to fix and mount histology sections.  It is used in surgical removal of [[tumors]], and allow rapid determination of margin (that the tumor has been completely removed).  It is done using a refrigeration device called a [[cryostat]].  The frozen tissue is sliced using a [[microtome]], and the frozen slices are mounted on a glass slide and stained the same way as other methods.  It is a necessary way to fix tissue for certain stain such as antibody linked [[immunofluorescence]] staining.
It can also be used to determine if a tumour is malignant when it is found incidentally during surgery on a patient.

=== Processing - dehydration, clearing, and infiltration===
[[File:Histological sample of Trachea obtained at "Instituto Nacional de Cardiología Ignacio A. Chávez".JPG|thumb|Sample of a trachea coloured with hematoxylin and eosin.]]
The aim of Tissue Processing is to remove water from tissues and replace with a medium that solidifies to allow thin sections to be cut. Biological tissue must be supported in a hard matrix to allow sufficiently thin sections to be cut, typically 5 μm (micrometres; 1000 micrometres = 1&nbsp;mm) thick for light microscopy and 80-100&nbsp;nm (nanometre; 1,000,000 nanometres = 1&nbsp;mm) thick for electron microscopy. For light microscopy, paraffin wax is most frequently used. Since it is immiscible with water, the main constituent of biological tissue, water must first be removed in the process of dehydration. Samples are transferred through baths of progressively more concentrated [[ethanol]] to remove the water. This is followed by a hydrophobic clearing agent (such as [[xylene]]) to remove the alcohol, and finally molten [[paraffin wax]], the infiltration agent, which replaces the xylene. 
Paraffin wax does not provide a sufficiently hard matrix for cutting very thin sections for electron microscopy. Instead, resins are used. Epoxy resins are the most commonly employed embedding media, but acrylic resins are also used, particularly where [[immunohistochemistry]] is required. Thicker sections (0.35μm to 5μm) of resin-embedded tissue can also be cut for light microscopy. Again, the immiscibility of most epoxy and acrylic resins with water necessitates the use of dehydration, usually with ethanol.

===Embedding===
After the tissues have been dehydrated, cleared, and infiltrated with the embedding material, they are ready for external embedding. During this process the tissue samples are placed into molds along with liquid embedding material (such as agar, gelatine, or wax) which is then hardened. This is achieved by cooling in the case of paraffin wax and heating (curing) in the case of the epoxy resins. The acrylic resins are polymerised by heat, ultraviolet light, or chemical catalysts. The hardened blocks containing the tissue samples are then ready to be sectioned. 

Because Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues may be stored indefinitely at room temperature, and nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) may be recovered from them decades after fixation, FFPE tissues are an important resource for historical studies in medicine. 

Embedding can also be accomplished using frozen, non-fixed tissue in a water-based medium.  Pre-frozen tissues are placed into molds with the liquid embedding material, usually a water-based glycol, OCT, TBS, Cryogel, or resin, which is then frozen to form hardened blocks.

===Sectioning===
Sectioning can be done in limited ways.  Vertical sectioning perpendicular to the surface of the tissue is the usual method.  Horizontal sectioning is often done in the evaluation of the hair follicles and pilosebaceous units.  Tangential to horizontal sectioning is done in [[Mohs surgery]] and in methods of [[CCPDMA]].  

For light microscopy, a steel knife mounted in a microtome is used to cut 4-[[micrometre|micrometer]]-thick tissue sections which are mounted on a glass [[microscope slide]]. For transmission electron microscopy, a diamond knife mounted in an   [[ultramicrotome]] is used to cut 50-[[nanometre|nanometer]]-thick tissue sections which are mounted on a 3-millimeter-diameter copper grid. Then the mounted sections are treated with the appropriate [[staining (biology)|stain]]. 

Frozen tissue embedded in a freezing medium is cut on a [[microtome]] in a cooled machine called a [[cryostat]].

===Staining===
[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|Example of staining in light microscopy: [[Carmine]] staining of a [[monogenea]]n (parasitic worm)]]

Biological tissue has little inherent contrast in either the light or electron microscope. Staining is employed  to give both contrast to the tissue as well as highlighting particular features of interest. Where the underlying mechanistic chemistry of staining is understood, the term [[histochemistry]] is used. [[Hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] ([[H&E stain]]) is the most commonly used light microscopical stain in histology and histopathology. Hematoxylin, a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dye, stains [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] blue due to an affinity to nucleic acids in the cell nucleus; eosin, an [[Acid (chemistry)|acidic]] dye, stains the [[cytoplasm]] pink. Uranyl acetate and lead citrate are commonly used to impart contrast to tissue in the electron microscope.

Special staining: There are hundreds of various other techniques that have been used to selectively stain cells and cellular components. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include [[safranin]], oil red o, Congo red, fast green FCF, silver salts, and numerous natural and artificial [[dye]]s that were usually originated from the development dyes for the textile industry.

[[Histochemistry]] refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the Perls [[Prussian blue]] reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like [[hemochromatosis]].

Histology samples have often been examined by radioactive techniques.  In [[historadiography]], a slide (sometimes stained histochemically) is X-rayed.  More commonly, [[autoradiography]] is used to visualize the locations to which a radioactive substance has been transported within the body, such as cells in [[S phase]] (undergoing [[DNA replication]]) which incorporate tritiated [[thymidine]], or sites to which radiolabeled [[nucleic acid]] probes bind in [[in situ hybridization]].  For autoradiography on a microscopic level, the slide is typically dipped into liquid nuclear tract emulsion, which dries to form the exposure film.  Individual silver grains in the film are visualized with [[dark field microscopy]].

Recently, [[antibodies]] have been used to specifically visualize proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. This process is called [[immunohistochemistry]], or when the stain is a [[fluorescent]] molecule, [[immunofluorescence]]. This technique has greatly increased the ability to identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques, such as nonradioactive ''in situ'' hybridization, can be combined with immunochemistry  to identify specific DNA or RNA molecules with fluorescent probes or tags that can be used for immunofluorescence and  [[enzyme-linked fluorescence]] amplification (especially [[alkaline phosphatase]] and [[tyramide signal amplification]]).  [[Fluorescence microscopy]] and [[confocal microscopy]] are used to detect fluorescent signals with good intracellular detail.  [[Digital camera]]s are increasingly used to capture histological and histopathological image

The [[Nissl method]] and [[Golgi's method]] are useful in identifying [[neuron]]s.

===Alternative techniques===
Alternative techniques include [[frozen section procedure|cryosection]]. The tissue is frozen using a [[cryostat]], and cut.  Tissue staining methods are similar to those of wax sections. Plastic embedding is commonly used in the preparation of material for electron microscopy.  Tissues are embedded in [[epoxy]] resin. Very thin sections (less than  0.1 micrometer) are cut using diamond or glass knives.  The sections are stained with electron dense stains (uranium and lead) so that they can possibly be seen with the [[electron microscope]].

==History==
[[File:Cajal-va.jpg|thumb|150px|Santiago Ramón y Cajal in his laboratory]]
In the 19th century, histology was an academic discipline in its own right.  The 1906 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to histologists [[Camillo Golgi]] and [[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]].  They had dueling interpretations of the neural structure of the brain based in differing interpretations of the same images. Cajal won the prize for his correct theory and Golgi for the staining technique he invented to make it possible.

==Histological classification of animal tissues==
There are four basic types of tissues: [[muscle tissue]], [[nervous tissue]], [[connective tissue]], and [[epithelial tissue]]. All tissue types are subtypes of these four basic tissue types (for example, blood cells are classified as connective tissue, since they generally originate inside bone marrow).

*[[Epithelium]]: the lining of glands, bowel, skin, and some organs like the liver, lung, and kidney
*[[Endothelium]]: the lining of blood and lymphatic vessels
*[[Mesothelium]]: the lining of pleural and pericardial spaces
*[[Mesenchyme]]: the cells filling the spaces between the organs, including fat, muscle, bone, cartilage, and tendon cells
*[[Blood cell]]s: the red and white blood cells, including those found in lymph nodes and spleen
*[[Neurons]]: any of the conducting cells of the nervous system
*[[Germ cell]]s: reproductive cells ([[spermatozoa]] in men, [[oocyte]]s in women)
*[[Placenta]]: an organ characteristic of true mammals during pregnancy, joining mother and offspring, providing endocrine secretion and selective exchange of soluble, but not particulate, blood-borne substances through an apposition of uterine and trophoblastic vascularised parts
*[[Stem cell]]s: cells with the ability to develop into different cell types

Note that tissues from plants, fungi, and microorganisms can also be examined histologically. Their structure is very different from animal tissues.

==Related sciences==
*[[Cell biology]] is the study of living cells, their DNA and RNA and the proteins they express.
*[[Anatomy]] is the study of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] visible by the naked eye.
*[[Morphology (biology)|Morphology]] studies entire organisms.

==Artifacts==
Artifacts are structures or features in tissue that interfere with normal histological examination. These are not always present in normal tissue and can come from outside sources. Artifacts interfere with histology by changing the tissues appearance and hiding structures. These can be divided into two categories:

===Pre-histology===
These are features and structures that have been introduced prior to the collection of the tissues. A common example of these include: ink from tattoos and freckles (melanin) in skin samples.

===Post-histology===
Artifacts can result from tissue processing. Processing commonly leads to changes like shrinkage, washing out of particular cellular components, color changes in different tissues types and alterations of the structures in the tissue. Because these are caused in a laboratory the majority of post histology artifacts can be avoided or removed after being discovered. A common example is mercury pigment left behind after using [[Zenker's fixative]] to fix a section.
