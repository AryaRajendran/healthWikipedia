{{suicide}}
A '''failed suicide attempt''' ({{lang-la|tentamen suicidii}}) is a [[suicide|suicidal action]] from which the actor survived. Some are regarded as not true attempts at all, but rather [[parasuicide]]. In parasuicide, the attempt may be a wish to affect another person by the behaviour. Consequently, it occurs in a social context and may represent a request for help. The behaviour is an act of desperation, and may result in severe injury or death anyway.<ref name="CrocettiBarone2004">{{cite book|author1=Michael Crocetti|author2=Michael A. Barone|author3=Frank A.

These people survive 97% of the time.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_index.php?idx=119&d=1&w=5&e=28649|title=Guns and Suicide|author=Schwartz, Allan N.|date=Apr 12th 2007}}</ref> About one-third of people who attempt suicide will repeat the attempt within 1 year, and about 10% of those who threaten or attempt suicide eventually do kill themselves.<ref>{{citation|title=Suicide and Suicidal Behavior|publisher=New York Times|url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/suicide-and-suicidal-behavior/overview.html}}</ref>

Attempted suicide can cause injury. For example, A.J. Reed attempted to kill himself with a shotgun and survived, but the blast destroyed most of his face and completely blinded him.<ref>{{citation|title=Single Shot, Second Chance|publisher=Discovery Channel|url=http://www.yourdiscovery.com/singleshot/}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Suicide is pointless, man testifies|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2007/06/09/rel_131547.shtml|publisher=The Augusta Chronicle|author=C.

A majority have injuries that are treated in the emergency room treatment, and then released. However, about 116,000 are hospitalized, of whom 110,000 are eventually discharged alive. Their average hospital stay is 10 days; the average cost is $15,000. Seventeen percent, some 19,000, of these people are permanently disabled, restricted in their ability to work, each year, at a cost of $127,000 per person.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stone, Geo|title=Suicide and Attempted Suicide|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-7867-0940-5|date=September 1, 2001}}</ref>
