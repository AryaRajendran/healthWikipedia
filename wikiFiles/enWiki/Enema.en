An '''enema''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|əm|ə}}; plural ''enemata'' or ''enemas'') is the procedure of introducing liquids into the [[rectum]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] via the [[anus]].  The increasing volume of the liquid causes rapid expansion of the lower intestinal tract, often resulting in very uncomfortable bloating, cramping, powerful [[peristalsis]], a feeling of extreme urgency and complete evacuation of the lower intestinal tract.  An enema has the advantage over any laxative in its speed and certainty of action, and some people prefer it for this reason.

Enemas can be carried out as treatment for medical conditions, such as [[constipation]] and [[encopresis]], and as part of some [[alternative health]] therapies. They are also used to administer certain medical or recreational [[drug]]s.  Enemas have been used for rehydration therapy (proctoclysis) in patients for whom [[intravenous therapy]] is not applicable.<ref>

==History==
[[Image:Clyster syringes.jpg|thumb|A normal clyster syringe (in front) and the nozzle for a syringe designed for self-administration (in the back). The latter avoided the need for a second party to attend an embarrassing procedure.]]
''Enema'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔνεμα (''énema''), from ἐνίημι (''eníēmi''), "(I) inject".

''Clyster'', also spelled ''glister'' in the 17th century, comes from Greek κλυστήρ (''klystḗr''), from κλύζω (''klýzo''), "(I) wash". It is an archaic word for enema, more particularly for enemas administered using a ''clyster syringe''&nbsp;&ndash; that is, a [[syringe]] with a rectal nozzle and a plunger rather than a bulb. Clyster syringes were used from the 17th century (or before) to the 19th century, when they were largely replaced by enema bulb syringes, bocks, and bags.

The patient was placed in an appropriate position (kneeling, with the buttocks raised, or lying on the side); a servant or [[apothecary]] would then insert the nozzle into the [[anus]] and depress the plunger, resulting in the liquid remedy (generally, [[water]], but also some preparations) being injected into the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].

Because of the embarrassment a woman might feel when showing her buttocks (and possibly her genitals, depending on the position) to a male apothecary, some contraptions were invented that blocked all from the apothecary's view except for the anal area. Another invention was syringes equipped with a special bent nozzle, which enabled self-administration, thereby eliminating the embarrassment.

Clysters were administered for symptoms of [[constipation]] and, with more questionable effectiveness, stomach aches and other illnesses.  In his early-modern treatise, ''The Diseases of Women with Child,'' [[François Mauriceau]] records that both midwives and man-midwives commonly administered clysters to labouring mothers just prior to their delivery.

In Roper's biography of his father-in-law [[Sir Thomas More]], he tells of Thomas More's eldest daughter falling sick of the sweating sickness. She could not be awakened by doctors. After praying, it came to Thomas More:

<blockquote>There straightway it came into his mind that a clyster would be the one way to help her, which when he told the physicians, they at once confessed that if there were any hope of health, it was the very best help indeed, much marveling among themselves that they had not afore remembered it.<br>
:— [[Utopia (book)|''Utopia'', Thomas More]]</blockquote>

Clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[nobility]] of the [[Western world]] up to the 19th century. As medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time, purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of [[ailment]]s, the foremost of which were [[stomach ache]]s and constipation.

[[Molière]], in several of his plays, introduces characters of incompetent [[physician]]s and [[apothecary|apothecaries]] fond of prescribing this remedy, also discussed by Argan, the [[hypochondriac]] patient of ''[[Le Malade Imaginaire]]''. More generally, clysters were a theme in the [[burlesque]] comedies of that time.

According to [[Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]], clysters were so popular at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[France]] that the duchess of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] had her servant give her a clyster in front of the King (her [[modesty]] being preserved by an adequate posture) before going to the [[comedy]]. However, he also mentions the astonishment of the King and Mme de Maintenon that she should take it before them.

==Medical usage==
The main medical usages of enemas are:

* As a [[bowel]] stimulant, not unlike a [[laxative]]&nbsp;– the main difference being that [[laxatives]] are commonly thought of as orally administered while enemas are administered directly into the rectum, and thereafter, into the colon.  When the enema injection into the rectum is complete, and after a set "holding time", the patient expels [[feces]] along with the enema in the [[bedpan]] or [[toilet]].
* Enemas may also be used to relieve [[constipation]] and [[fecal impaction]], although in the U.S.A. and some other parts of the world, their use has been replaced in most professional health-care settings by oral laxatives and laxative [[suppository|suppositories]].  In-home use of enemas for constipation and alternative health purposes is somewhat harder to measure.
* Bowel stimulating enemas usually consist of water, which works primarily as a mechanical stimulant, or they may be made up of water with [[baking soda]] ([[sodium bicarbonate]]) or water with a mild [[hand soap]] dissolved in it.  [[buffer solution|Buffered]] [[sodium phosphates#Use|sodium phosphate]] solution draws additional water from the bloodstream into the colon to increase the effectiveness of the enema, but can be rather irritating to the colon, causing intense cramping or "griping."  [[Mineral oil]] functions as a lubricant and stool softener, but often has the side effect of sporadic seepage from the patient's anus which can soil undergarments for up to 24 hours.  [[Glycerol]] is a specific bowel mucosa irritant and when introduced in very dilute solution serves to induce [[peristalsis]]. 
* Other types of enema solutions are also used, including equal parts of milk and molasses heated together to slightly above normal body temperature. In the past, [[castile soap]] was a common additive in an  enema, but it has largely fallen out of use because of its irritating action in the rectum and because of the risk of [[chemical colitis]] as well as the ready availability of other enema preparations that are perhaps more effective than soap in stimulating a bowel movement. At the opposite end of the spectrum, an [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] [[saline (medicine)|saline]] solution is least irritating to the rectum and colon, having a neutral concentration gradient.  This neither draws [[electrolyte]]s from the body&nbsp;– as can happen with plain water – nor draws water into the colon, as will occur with [[sodium phosphates#Use|phosphates]].  Thus, a salt water solution can be used when a longer period of retention is desired, such as to soften an impaction.
* Cleansing the lower bowel prior to a surgical procedure such as [[sigmoidoscopy]]  or [[colonoscopy]].  Because of speed and supposed convenience, enemas used for this purpose are commonly the more costly, [[Sodium phosphates#Use|sodium phosphate]] variety&nbsp;– often called a disposable enema. A more pleasant experience preparing for testing procedures can usually be obtained with gently administered baking soda enemas; cleansing the lower bowel for colonoscopy and other bowel studies can be effectively achieved with water-based, or water with baking soda, enema administration.
* The administration of substances into the bloodstream.  This may be done in situations where it is undesirable or impossible to deliver a medication by mouth, such as [[antiemetic]]s given to reduce [[nausea]] (though not many antiemetics are delivered by enema). Additionally, several anti-angiogenic agents, which work better without digestion, can be safely administered via a gentle enema. Medicines for cancer, for arthritis, and for age-related macular degeneration are often given via enema in order to avoid the normally-functioning digestive tract. Interestingly, some water-based enemas are also used as a relieving agent for irritable bowel syndrome, using cayenne pepper to squelch irritation in the colon and rectal area. Finally, an enema may also be used for [[Rehydration|hydration]] purposes. See also [[route of administration]].
* Emergency blood expansion. Emergency pre-hospital treatment of haemorrhage requires immediate fluid replacement therapy. In mass casualty, remote or rural settings, the lack of sterile fluids, intravenous equipment or the knowledge to use them might limit the treatment options available. In such situations proctoclysis remains an easy, safe and effective way to provide fluid replacement. It does not require sterile fluids, special equipment or complex training, and it is useful when alternative routes are not readily available.<ref name="Tremayne V (2009) Proctoclysis: emergency rectal fluid infusion. Nursing Standard. 24, 3, 46-48.
Date of acceptance: July 21 2009."> [http://vincetremayne.com/resources/Emergency%2Brectal%2Binfusion.pdf] </ref>
* The topical administration of medications into the rectum, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[mesalazine]] used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].  Administration by enema avoids having the medication pass through the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]], therefore simplifying the delivery of the medication to the affected area and limiting the amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
* [[General anesthetic]] agents for surgical purposes are sometimes administered by way of an enema. Occasionally, anesthetic agents are used rectally to reduce medically induced vomiting during and after surgical procedures, in an attempt to avoid aspiration of stomach contents.
* A [[barium enema]] is used as a contrast substance in the [[Röntgen ray|radiological]] imaging of the bowel.  The enema may contain barium sulfate powder, or a water-soluble contrast agent. Barium enemas are sometimes the only practical way to "view" the colon in a relatively safe manner. Following barium enema administration, patients often find that flushing the remaining barium with additional water, baking soda, or saline enemas helps restore normal colon activity without complications of constipation from the administration of the barium sulfate.
* Rectal corticosteroid enemas are sometimes used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone.

In certain countries, such as the [[United States]], customary enema usage went well into the 20th century; it was thought a good idea to cleanse the bowel in case of [[fever]]; also, pregnant women were given enemas prior to [[childbirth|labor]], supposedly to reduce the risk of [[feces]] being passed during contractions. Under some controversial discussion, pre-delivery enemas were also given to women to speed delivery by inducing contractions. This latter usage has since been largely abandoned, because obstetricians now commonly give [[pitocin]] to induce labor and because women generally found the procedure unpleasant.

Now obsolete, the [[tobacco smoke enema]] was the principal medical method for resuscitating victims of [[drowning]] during the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Home usage==

Many self-given enemas used at home are the packaged, disposable, [[sodium phosphates#Use|sodium phosphate]] solutions in single-use bottles sold under a variety of brand names, or in generic formats. These units come with a lubricated nozzle attached to the top of the container. Some enemas are administered using so-called disposable bags connected to disposable tubing (despite the names, such units can commonly be used for many months or years without significant deterioration).

Patients who want easier, more gently accepted enemas often purchase combination enema syringes which are commonly referred to as "closed top" syringes, and which can also be used as old-fashioned [[hot water bottle]]s, so as to relieve aches and pains via gentle heat administrations to parts of the body. 

In Asian countries, particularly in Japan, commercially available disposable enemas typically contain [[glycerin#Use|glycerin]] (at concentrations varying from 30-50%) or [[sodium chloride#Use|sodium chloride]]. They are not lubricated and the amount of liquid contained in them may vary, although most contain about 20-40ml of diluted glycerin.

In medical or hospital environments, reusable enema equipment is now rare because of the expense of disinfecting a water-based solution. For a single-patient stay of short duration, an inexpensive disposable enema bag can be used for several days or weeks, using a simple rinse out procedure after each enema administration. The difficulty comes from the longer time period (and expense) required of nursing aides to give a gentle, water-based enema to a patient, as compared to the very few minutes it takes the same nursing aide to give the more irritating, cold, packaged sodium phosphate unit.

For home use, disposable enema bottle units are common, but reusable [[rubber]] or [[vinyl]] bags or enema bulbs may also be used.  In former times, enemas were infrequently administered using [[clyster]] syringes. If such commercially available items are not at hand, ordinary water bottles are sometimes used.

==Alternative medicine==
{{main|Alternative Medicine}}

The term "colonic irrigation" is commonly used in [[gastroenterology]] to refer to the practice of introducing water through a colostomy or a surgically constructed conduit as a treatment for [[constipation]].<ref name="pmid11113099">{{cite journal |author=Locke GR, Pemberton JH, Phillips SF |title=AGA technical review on constipation |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=1766–78 |year=2000 |pmid=11113099 |doi=10.1053/gast.2000.20392}}</ref> The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has ruled that colonic irrigation equipment is not approved for sale for the purpose of general well-being<ref>{{cite web| title= Subpart F--Therapeutic Devices Sec. 876.5220 Colonic irrigation system |work=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Food and Drugs, Subchapter H -- Medical Devices, Part 876 -- Gatroenterology-Urology Devices |date=2007-04-01 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=876.5220 |publisher=FDA}}</ref> and has taken action against many distributors of this equipment, including a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Department of Health and Human Services |title=Warning letter to Dotolo Research Corp |url=http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/prod/1999/dotolo.shtml |format=reprint by Casewatch |date=1999-07-21 |publisher=FDA |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> The use of enemas for reasons other than the relief of constipation is currently regulated in some parts of the [[United States]]{{Citation Needed|date=May 2012}} while practitioners in other states may go through a voluntary [[professional certification|certification]] process.{{Citation Needed|date=May 2012}}

==Rectal drug administration==
An enema might be used to clean the colon of [[feces]] first to help increase the rate of absorption in rectal administration of dissolved drugs, including alcohol.<ref name="pmid6126289">{{cite journal |author=de Boer AG, Moolenaar F, de Leede LG, Breimer DD |title=Rectal drug administration: clinical pharmacokinetic considerations |journal=Clin Pharmacokinet |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=285–311 |year=1982 |pmid=6126289 |doi=}}</ref>

Enemas have also been used for ritual rectal drug administration such as [[balché]], [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[peyote]], and other [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]]s and [[entheogen]]s, most notably by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and also some other [[United States|America]]n [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] tribes. Some tribes continue the practice in the present day.<ref name="isbn0-06-084550-3">{{cite book |author=Diamond, Jared M. |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (P.S.) |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York, N.Y |year= 1992 |page= 432 |isbn=0-06-084550-3 |oclc= |doi=}}; pp. 201</ref>

People who wish to become intoxicated faster have also been known to use an [[alcohol enema]] as a method to instill alcohol into the bloodstream, absorbed through the membranes of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]. However, great care must be taken as to the amount of alcohol used. Only a small amount is needed as the intestine absorbs the alcohol more quickly than the stomach. Deaths have resulted due to [[alcohol poisoning]] via enema.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2007-13.html | title = The Enema Within | accessdate = 2008-01-11 | year = 2008 | publisher = [[Darwin Awards]] }}</ref>

==Recreational usage==
[[Image:Aluminium Enema Nozzle 02.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An aluminium enema nozzle.  Specialty enema nozzles are common for non-medical usage, available on the Internet and in [[sex shop]]s in a variety of sizes, styles, and materials.]]
[[Image:Inflatable enema nozzle in harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An inflatable enema nozzle shown in a harness, but usually used without. Once inserted, the nozzle is inflated to a much larger size than can fit back out, allowing the recipient to relax their muscles while holding the enema, retain a solution they wouldn't normally be able to retain, or to be forced to take an enema as part of [[BDSM]] activities.]]

The [[paraphilia]] directed towards enemas is known as [[klismaphilia]], the enjoyment of enemas.

Enemas may be used as part of [[BDSM]] activities, or as a regular sexual activity for an individual or between partners. Enemas can be pleasurable to either sex, and in males, enemas can stimulate the [[prostate]] gland.  Unexpected [[erection]]s are common in medical settings, even if the person would otherwise consider it an unpleasant procedure.

An enema may also be used prior to [[anal sex]] or [[anilingus]] in order to enhance the sensation of intercourse, or to remove [[feces]] prior to sex, possibly reducing bacterial transmission and risk of infection, or just to reduce the possibility of fecal material or detritus from sexual activity adhering to the genitals or sex toys used during the subsequent activity. Enemas used for anal sex should not be used consistently and enema bottle contents should be removed and replaced with simple luke-warm water. Continual usage of enema solution may be harmful for the anal cavity.

==Punitive usage==
Antagonistic factions in unstable nations have often forcibly applied enemas as a means of punishment. In the vastly influential Latin American text [[Facundo|''Facundo, or Civilization and Barbarism'']], for example, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] describes the use of [[Chili pepper|pepper]] and [[turpentine]] enemas by police forces as a way of discouraging political dissent in post-independence Argentina.<ref>"Ribbons and Rituals". In Problems in Modern Latin American History. Ed. Chasteen and Wood. Oxford, UK: Scholarly Resources, 2005. p. 97</ref>

==Precautions==
Improper administration of an enema may cause electrolyte imbalance (with repeated enemas) or ruptures to the [[bowel]] or [[rectum|rectal]] tissues resulting in internal [[bleeding]]. However, these occurrences are rare in healthy, [[sobriety|sober]] adults. Internal bleeding or rupture may leave the individual exposed to infections from intestinal bacteria. Blood resulting from tears in the colon may not always be visible, but can be distinguished if the feces are unusually dark or have a red hue. If intestinal rupture is suspected, medical assistance should be obtained immediately.<ref>{{Cite document | title = Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health |first = ME | last = Martelli | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-11 | format = {{Dead link|date=April 2009}}&nbsp;&ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AMartelli+intitle%3AEncyclopedia+of+Nursing+and+Allied+Health&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> | publisher = [[FindArticles]] | postscript = <!--None--> |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123073414/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}</ref>

The enema tube and solution may stimulate the [[vagus nerve]], which may trigger an [[arrhythmia]] such as [[bradycardia]]. Enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed [[abdominal pain]] since the [[peristalsis]] of the [[bowel]] can cause an inflamed [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] to [[rupture]].

There are arguments both for and against colonic irrigation in people with [[diverticulitis]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], severe or internal [[hemorrhoids]] or [[tumors]] in the [[rectum]] or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], and its usage is not recommended soon after bowel [[surgery]] (unless directed by one's [[health care provider]]). Regular treatments should be avoided by people with [[heart disease]] or [[renal failure]]. Colonics are inappropriate for people with bowel, rectal or anal [[disease|pathologies]] where the pathology contributes to the risk of [[bowel perforation]].<ref name="ihealth">{{cite web |title=Colon Hydrotherapy |work=Aetna IntelliHealth |url=http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/34968/358752.html?d=dmtContent |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>
