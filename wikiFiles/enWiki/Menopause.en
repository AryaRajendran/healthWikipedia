'''Menopause''' literally means the "end of monthly cycles" (the end of [[monthly period]]s aka [[menstruation]]), from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''pausis'' (cessation) and the root ''men-'' (month). Menopause is an event that typically (but not always) occurs in women in [[midlife]], during their late 40s or early 50s, and it signals the end of the [[fertility|fertile]] phase of a woman's life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Menopause|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001896/}}</ref> However, rather than being defined by the state of the [[uterus]] and the absence of menstrual flow, menopause is more accurately defined as the permanent cessation of the primary functions of the [[ovaries]]:<ref name="Whales and humans linked by 'helpful grandmothers – BBC News">Whales and humans linked by 'helpful grandmothers – BBC News</ref> the ripening and release of [[ovum|ova]] and the release of [[hormone]]s that cause both the creation of the [[uterine lining]], and the subsequent shedding of the uterine lining (a.k.a. the menses or the period). {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

This transition from a potentially [[reproductive]] to a non-reproductive state is the result of a reduction in female [[hormonal]] production by the ovaries.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This transition is normally not sudden or abrupt, tends to occur over a period of years, and is a consequence of [[biological aging]].  However, for some women, the accompanying signs and effects that can occur during the menopause transition years can significantly disrupt their daily activities and sense of well-being.  In addition, women who have some sort of functional disorder affecting the reproductive system (e.g., [[endometriosis]], [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], cancer of the reproductive organs) can go into menopause at a younger age than the normal timeframe. The functional disorders often significantly speed up the menopausal process and create more significant health problems, both physical and emotional, for the affected woman.

The word "menopause" was coined specifically for [[human]] females, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, menopause also exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation;<ref name="Walker2">{{cite journal|author=Walker ML and Herndon JG|title=Menopause in nonhuman primates?|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=79|issue=3|pages=398–406|year=2008|pmid=18495681|pmc=2553520 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536}}</ref> in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan.

The date of menopause in human females is formally medically defined as the time of the last menstrual period (or menstrual flow of any amount, however small), in those women who have not had a [[hysterectomy]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Women who have their [[uterus]] removed but retain their [[ovaries]] do ''not'' immediately go into menopause, even though their periods cease. Adult women who have their ovaries removed however, go immediately into full '''surgical menopause''', no matter how young they are.

Menopause is an unavoidable change that every woman will experience, assuming she reaches [[middle age]] and beyond.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It is helpful if women are able to learn what to expect and what options are available to assist the transition, if that becomes necessary. Menopause has a wide starting range, but can usually be expected in the age range of 42–58.<ref name="Bucher, et al. 1930">Bucher, et al. 1930</ref> An early menopause can be related to [[cigarette]] smoking, higher [[body mass index]], racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy|radiation]] and the [[Oophorectomy|surgical removal of the ovaries]], with or without the removal of the uterus.<ref name="Bucher, et al. 1930"/>

Menopause can be officially declared (in an adult woman who is not [[pregnant]], is not [[lactating]], and who has an intact uterus) when there has been [[amenorrhea]] (absence of any menstruation) for one complete year.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, there are many signs and effects that lead up to this point, many of which may extend well beyond the "official" declaration date of menopause. These include: irregular menses, [[vasomotor]] instability ([[hot flash]]es and night sweats), atrophy of [[genitourinary system|genitourinary]] tissue, increased stress, breast tenderness, vaginal dryness, forgetfulness, mood changes, and in certain cases [[osteoporosis]] and/or heart disease.<ref>Bucher, et al., 1931</ref> These effects are related to the hormonal changes a woman's body is going through, and they affect each woman to a different extent. The only sign or effect that all women universally have in common is that by the end of the menopause transition every woman will have a complete cessation of menses.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Age==
In the [[Western world]], the most typical age range for menopause (last period from natural causes) is between the ages of 40 and 61<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Mary Jane Minkin |last=Minkin |first=Mary Jane |last2=''et al.'' |year=1997 |title=What Every Woman Needs to Know about Menopause |location= |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=0-300-07261-9 }}</ref> and the average age for last period is 51 years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kato I, Toniolo P, Akhmedkhanov A, Koenig KL, Shore R, Zeleniuch-Jacquotte A | year = 1998 | title = Prospective study of factors influencing the onset of natural menopause | url = | journal = J Clin Epidemiol | volume = 51 | issue = 12| pages = 1271–1276 | doi = 10.1016/S0895-4356(98)00119-X | pmid = 10086819 }}</ref>  The average age of  natural menopause (in Australia) is 51.7 years,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Do KA, Treloar SA, Pandeya N ''et al.'' | year = 1998 | title = Predictive factors of age at menopause in a large Australian twin study | url = | journal = Hum Biol | volume = 70 | issue = 6| pages = 1073–91 | pmid = 9825597 }}</ref> although this varies considerably from one woman to another.

According to one study, women who smoke [[cigarette]]s experience menopause significantly earlier than non-smokers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaufman |first=D.

===Premature menopause===
In rare cases, a woman's ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of [[puberty]] to age 40, and this is known as [[premature ovarian failure]] (POF).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Spontaneous premature ovarian failure affects 1% of women by age 40, and 0.1% of women by age 30.  POF is not considered to be due to the normal effects of aging. Known causes of premature ovarian failure include [[autoimmune disorder]]s, [[thyroid]] disease, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[chemotherapy]], being a carrier of the [[fragile X syndrome]] gene, and [[radiotherapy]]. However, in the majority of spontaneous cases of premature ovarian failure, the cause is unknown, i.e.  it is generally [[idiopathic]].<ref name="Kalantaridou SN 1006">Kalantaridou SN, Davis SR, Nelson LM. ''Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am.'' 1998 Dec;27(4) 989–1006.</ref>

POF is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) on at least 3 occasions at least 4 weeks apart.<ref name="Kalantaridou SN 1006"/> Rates of premature menopause have been found to be significantly higher in fraternal and identical [[twins]]; approximately 5% of twins reach menopause before the age of 40.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The reasons for this are not completely understood. Transplants of ovarian tissue between identical twins have been successful in restoring fertility.

==Background==
The menopause transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural life change, not a disease state or a disorder. The transition itself has a variable degree of effects: it can be a difficult time of life.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Menopause is perhaps most easily understood as the opposite process to [[menarche]], the start of the monthly periods.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, menopause in women cannot satisfactorily be defined simply as the permanent "stopping of the monthly periods", because in reality what is happening to the [[uterus]] is quite secondary to the process; it is what is happening to the [[ovary|ovaries]] that is the crucial factor.

As an illustration of the central role that the ovaries play, it is worth pointing out that when for medical reasons the uterus has to be surgically removed ([[hysterectomy]]) in a younger woman, her periods will of course cease permanently, and the woman will be incapable of pregnancy, but as long as at least one of her ''ovaries'' is still functioning, the woman will ''not'' have reached menopause.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Even without the presence of the uterus, [[ovulation]] and the release of the sequence of reproductive hormones will continue to cycle on, until menopause is reached. In contrast to this, in circumstances where a woman's [[ovaries]] are removed ([[oophorectomy]]), even if the uterus were to be left intact, the woman will immediately be in "surgical menopause". Surgical menopause is a menopause which is induced both suddenly and totally, by removal of both ovaries prior to the age of natural menopause.

On average, assuming there has been no surgical intervention, the first evidence of the onset of the menopause transition time is slight variations in the length of the menstrual cycle.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} These variations become more pronounced over time, and eventually lead to cycles that can be considerably longer or considerably shorter than usual, flow that can be significantly lighter or heavier than usual, skipped ovulations, skipped periods, and spans of time of many months with no flow at all, after which menstruation may resume.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The transition is considered to be over once a woman has experienced 12 months without any menstrual bleeding at all, even though perimenopause effects may extend well beyond this point in time. The term "perimenopause", which literally means "around the menopause", refers to the menopause transition years, a span of time both before and after the date of the final episode of flow.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===The hormonal context===
The stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman's reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary  [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Soules MR, Sherman S, Parrott E ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Executive summary: Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) | url = | journal = Climacteric | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 267–72 | pmid = 11770182 }}</ref>

In younger women, during a normal [[menstrual cycle]] the ovaries produce [[estradiol]], [[testosterone]] and [[progesterone]] in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) which are both produced by the [[pituitary gland]].  Blood [[estradiol]] levels remain relatively unchanged, or may increase approaching the menopause, but are usually well preserved until the late perimenopause. This is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Burger HG | year = 1994 | title = Diagnostic role of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements during menopausal transition – an analysis of FSH, oestradiol and inhibin | url = | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 130 | issue = 1| pages = 38–42 | doi = 10.1530/eje.0.1300038 | pmid = 8124478 }}</ref> However, the menopause transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels, and because of this, measurements of these hormones are ''not'' considered to be reliable guides to a woman's exact menopausal status.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Burger HG | year = 1994 | title = Diagnostic role of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements during menopausal transition – an analysis of FSH, oestraiol and inhibim | url = | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 130 | issue = 1| pages = 38–42 | doi = 10.1530/eje.0.1300038 | pmid = 8124478 }}</ref>

Menopause is based on the natural or surgical cessation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, which are a part of the body's [[endocrine system]] of [[hormone]] production, in this case the hormones which make reproduction possible and influence sexual behavior. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced in other tissues, notably the ovaries, but also in bone, blood vessels and even in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Simpson ER, Davis SR | year = 2001 | title = Minireview: aromatase and the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis – some new perspectives | url = | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 142 | issue = 11| pages = 4589–94 | doi = 10.1210/en.142.11.4589 | pmid = 11606422 }}</ref> However the dramatic fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.

In contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free [[testosterone]], as well as [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (DHEAS) and [[androstenedione]] appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating [[androgen]] levels has not been observed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Davison SL, Bell R, Donath S, Montalto JG, Davis SR | year = 2005 | title = Androgen levels in adult females: changes with age, menopause, and oophorectomy | url = | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 90 | issue = 7| pages = 3847–53 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-0212 | pmid = 15827095 }}</ref> Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production. However, women who have had their ovaries surgically removed, who have had their ovaries damaged by chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or who have ovarian gonadotropin suppression, do have loss of ovarian androgen production as a result.

Menopause can be surgically induced by bilateral [[oophorectomy]] (removal of ovaries), which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the Fallopian tubes ([[salpingo-oophorectomy]]) and uterus ([[hysterectomy]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called "surgical menopause". The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels usually produces extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. Removal of the uterus without removal of the ovaries, a hysterectomy, does not cause menopause, although pelvic surgery can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries.

==Terminology==
There is some overlap in the meaning of the various terms used to refer to menopause and the menopause transition years. In addition some of the terms are used differently in common parlance than they are by medical professionals.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Review of Terminology===
(Information below is cited from):<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Connie|title=Perimenopause|url=http://ce.nurse.com/PrintTopic.aspx?TopicId=764|work=Is It Hot In Here or Is It Just Me?|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref> 
* Menopause: Is recognized after 12 months of amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).  The ovaries reduce production of estrogen and progesterone severely.  The terms menopause and postmenopause are often used interchangeable.  
* Perimenopause: transition from reproductive life to menopause.  Characterized by irregularities in menstrual cycle.  Average age is 45 to 47, but may occur as early as 35.  Some hallmark symptoms of perimenopause: shortening of menstrual cycle, shorter or longer duration of bleeding, heavier bleeding, increased mood disturbances, sleeplessness, or hot flashes.  Women have reported having up to 50 a day. 
* Premature menopause: menopause before the age of 40.  Often referred to as premature ovarian failure.  Uncommon, less than 0.3% of women in United States of America. 
* Natural Menopause: Spontaneously, without medical intervention.  Occurs when not had a menstrual period for one year.  Average age in Western world is 51, with the average range being between 45 to 55 years old.  Two things that many influence the age of onset of natural menopause are smoking and genetics.  Women who smoke may reach menopause two years earlier than nonsmoking counterparts.  Also, daughters tend to experience menopause at nearly the same age as their mother.  
* Induced Menopause: When medical intervention results in the loss of ovarian function.  This can occur as a result of when the ovaries are removed (with a hysterectomy), or due to chemotherapy, radiation, or medications that affect the hormones.  During induced menopause, this abrupt stop of the menstruation often result sin more profound vasomotor systems (hot flashes and night sweats).  Also, these women are at a greater risk for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis than women who experience menopause naturally.

===Menopause===
Clinically speaking, menopause is defined as a specific date. Assuming the woman still has a uterus, menopause is defined as the day after the woman's final episode of menstrual flow finishes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This date is fixed retrospectively, once 12 months have gone by with no menstrual flow at all. At this point a woman is considered to be one year into postmenopause, is considered to be infertile, and no longer needs to take into consideration the possibility of pregnancy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In common parlance, however, the word "menopause" usually refers not to just one day, but to the whole of the menopause transition years. This span of time is also commonly called the '''change of life''', the '''change''', or the '''climacteric''' and more recently is known as "perimenopause", (literally meaning "around menopause").{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The word menopause is also often used in popular parlance to mean all the years of '''postmenopause'''.

{{anchor|Perimenopause}}

===Perimenopause aka the menopause transition===
Perimenopause is the menopause transition years. According to the North American Menopause Society, this transition can last for four to eight years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Menopause 101|url=http://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-101-a-primer-for-the-perimenopausal|work=A primer for the perimenopausal|publisher=The North American Menopause Society|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref> In women who have a uterus, perimenopause takes place in the years before and after the final period (although it is only possible to determine in retrospect which episode of flow was indeed the final period).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} As a medical convenience, perimenopause is technically defined as the time from which menses start to become irregular and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have increased, until the time when it is known that periods have ceased completely. However, the hormonal changes are gradual, both in onset and in termination, and therefore the various possible perimenopause effects often start before and continue after this neatly defined time slot.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

During perimenopause, the ovarian production of the [[estrogen]]s and [[progesterone]]  becomes more irregular, often with wide and unpredictable fluctuations in levels.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} These fluctuations in the hormone level of estrogen is what causes many physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chichester|first=Melanie|coauthors=Ciranni, Patricia|title=Approaching Menopause (But Not There Yet!)|journal=Nursing for Women's Health|year=2011|month=August/September|volume=15|issue=4|page=320|doi=10.1111/j.175-486X.2011.01652.x|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com.proxy.lib.odu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e4ea4b92-f755-4cb3-b1cc-a39a73af9a1c%40sessionmgr104&vid=1&hid=101|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>  Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, vaginal dryness or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis and heart disease.  During this period, fertility diminishes, but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.

Signs and effects of the menopause transition can begin as early as age 35, although most women become aware of the transition in their mid to late 40s, often many years after the actual beginning of the perimenopausal window.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The duration of perimenopause with noticeable bodily effects can be as brief as a few years, but it is not unusual for the duration to last ten or more years. The actual duration and severity of perimenopause effects for any individual woman currently cannot be predicted in advance. Even during the process, the course of an individual woman's perimenopause can be difficult if not impossible to predict.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Even though the process, or the course of perimenopause or menopause can be difficult to predict, often the age onset is somewhat predictable.  Women often, but not always will start this transitions (perimenopause and menopause) about the same time as their mom.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kessenich|first=Cathy|title=Inevitalbe Menopause|url=http://ce.nurse.com/ce232-60/inevitable-menopause/coursepage/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>     

During the perimenopause years, many women undergo noticeable and clinically observable physical changes resulting from hormonal fluctuations. The best-known of these is the "hot flash" or "hot flush", a sudden temporary increase in body temperature. The "flash" sensation occurs as the body temperature soars upward, reaching a peak very rapidly.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The "hot" sensation is not the initial temperature rise; rather, it is a reaction to the slowness of the body's return to a more normal temperature range.

Hot flashes can be so strong that they raise the body temperature by many degrees in a very short period of time; this extreme temperature differential can cause the sufferer to feel weak and break out in heavy sweating. Despite the discomfort to the woman, hot flashes are not considered harmful by physicians. In most cases, flashes can be treated to ease extreme discomfort, using prescription medications such as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) or [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] medications, or by using over-the-counter plant estrogens and herbal remedies. Many women manage hot flashes by dressing in ways that dissipate heat quickly (natural fibers, loose clothing, easily removable layers of lightweight garments) as well as mechanical means which help the body to remove excess heat, such as fans, drinking ice water, and staying in cool rooms.

Other common effects encountered during the perimenopausal period include mood changes, [[insomnia]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and memory problems.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Menopause may, in some women, bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition this change often occurs at a time of life when other stressors may be present in the life of a woman:

* Having to deal with caring for, and/or the death of, elderly parents
* The so-called "empty-nest syndrome" when children leave home
* The birth of grandchildren, which places people of "middle age" into a new category of "older people" (especially in those cultures where being older is a state that is not venerated but looked down on)

Recent research shows that [[melatonin]] supplementation in perimenopausal women can produce a significant improvement in thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing the depression associated with the menopause.<ref name= Bellipanni_2005>{{cite journal | author = Bellipanni G, DI Marzo F, Blasi F ''et al.'' | year = | title = Effects of melatonin in perimenopausal and menopausal women: our personal experience. 2005 | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1057 | issue = | pages = 393–402 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1356.030 | pmid = 16399909 }}</ref>

===Premenopause===
Premenopause is the years leading up to the last period, when the levels of reproductive hormones are already becoming lower and more erratic, and the effects of hormone withdrawal may be present.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Postmenopause===
The term ''postmenopause'' is applied to women who have not experienced a menstrual bleed for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they do still have a [[uterus]], and are not [[pregnant]] or [[lactation|lactating]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause is identified by a very high FSH level. Thus postmenopause is all of the time in a woman's life that take place after her last period, or more accurately, all of the time that follows the point when her ovaries become inactive.

A woman who still has her uterus (and who is neither pregnant nor lactating) can be declared to be in postmenopause once she has gone 12 full months with no flow at all, not even any spotting.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} When she reaches that point, she is one year into postmenopause.

The reason for this delay in declaring a woman postmenopausal is because periods are usually extremely erratic at this time of life, and therefore a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has actually ceased completely.

At this point a woman is considered infertile, and no longer needs to consider the possibility of becoming pregnant. However the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not zero) for a number of years before this point is reached.

In women who have no uterus, and therefore have no periods, post-menopause can be determined by a blood test which can reveal the very high levels of [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone]] (FSH) that are typical of post-menopausal women.

A woman's reproductive hormone levels continue to drop and fluctuate for some time into post-menopause, so any hormone withdrawal symptoms that a woman may be experiencing do not necessarily stop right away, but may take quite some time, even several years, to disappear completely.

Any period-like flow that might occur during postmenopause, even just spotting, must be reported to a doctor. The cause may in fact be minor, but the possibility of [[endometrial cancer]] must be checked for and eliminated.

==Indications and signs==
During the menopause transition years, as the body responds to the rapidly fluctuating and dropping levels of natural [[hormone]]s, a number of effects may appear.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Not every woman experiences bothersome levels of these effects; the range of effects and the degree to which they appear is very variable from person to person.

Effects that are due to low estrogen levels (for example vaginal atrophy and skin drying) will continue after the menopause transition years are over; however, many effects that are caused by the extreme fluctuations in hormone levels (for example hot flashes and mood changes) usually disappear or improve significantly once the perimenopause transition is completely over. All the various possible perimenopause effects are caused by an overall drop, as well as dramatic but erratic fluctuations, in the absolute levels and relative levels of estrogens and progesterone. Effects such as [[formication]] (crawling, itching, or tingling skin sensations), may be associated directly with hormone [[withdrawal]].

Both users and non-users of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] identify lack of energy as the most frequent and distressing effect.<ref name="pmid17970860">{{cite journal |author=Twiss JJ, Wegner J, Hunter M, Kelsay M, Rathe-Hart M, Salado W |title=Perimenopausal symptoms, quality of life, and health behaviors in users and nonusers of hormone therapy |journal=J Am Acad Nurse Pract |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=602–13 |year=2007 |pmid=17970860 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7599.2007.00260.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1041-2972&date=2007&volume=19&issue=11&spage=602}}</ref> Other effects can include [[vasomotor]] symptoms such as [[hot flash]]es and [[palpitation]]s, psychological effects such as [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], irritability, [[mood swing]]s, memory problems and lack of concentration, and atrophic effects such as vaginal dryness and urgency of urination.

The average woman also has increasingly erratic menstrual periods, due to skipped ovulations.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Typically, the timing of the flow becomes unpredictable. In addition the duration of the flow may be considerably shorter or longer than normal, and the flow itself may be significantly heavier or lighter than was previously the case, including sometimes long episodes of spotting. Early in the process it is not uncommon to have some 2-week cycles. Further into the process it is common to skip periods for months at a time, and these skipped periods may be followed by a heavier period. The number of skipped periods in a row often increases as the time of last period approaches.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} At the point when a woman of menopausal age has had no periods or spotting for 12 months, she is considered to be one year into post-menopause.

One way of assessing the impact on women of some of these menopause effects is the [[Greene Menopause Index|Greene Climacteric Scale]] questionnaire.

For example, a 2007 study found that menopause was associated with [[hot flash]]es; [[joint pain]] and [[muscle pain]]; and [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]].<ref name="pmid17666595">{{cite journal |author=Freeman EW, Sammel MD, Lin H, ''et al.'' |title=Symptoms associated with menopausal transition and reproductive hormones in midlife women |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology |volume=110 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=230–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17666595 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000270153.59102.40}}</ref> In the same study, it appeared that menopause was not associated with poor sleep, [[decreased libido]], and [[vaginal lubrication|vaginal dryness]].<ref name="pmid17666595"/> However, in contrast to this, a 2008 study did find an association with poor sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pien GW, Sammel MD, Freeman EW, Lin H, DeBlasis TL |title=Predictors of sleep quality in women in the menopausal transition |journal=Sleep |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=991–9 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18652094 |pmc=2491505 }}</ref>

==Cause==
The causes of menopause can be considered from complementary [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate]] (mechanistic) perspectives (how it happens) or from ultimate (adaptive evolutionary) perspectives (why it happens). The latter group are hypotheses only.

===Proximate perspective===
Natural or physiological menopause occurs as a part of a woman's normal aging process. It is the result of the eventual depletion of almost all of the oocytes and [[ovarian follicles]]<ref>[http://www.obgyn.net/menopause/menopause.asp?page=/meno/news_articles/kenemans_0699 Peter Kenemans, MD, PhD. Menopause, Perimenopause & Postmenopause: Definitions, Terms & Concepts]</ref> in the ovaries. This causes an increase in circulating [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels because there are a decreased number of [[oocyte]]s and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen. This decrease in the production of estrogen leads to the perimenopausal symptoms of hot flashes, insomnia and mood changes. Long term effects may include [[osteoporosis]] and [[vaginal atrophy]].

===Evolutionary theories of menopause===
In contrast to males, females invest more in their [[gamete]]s, making them a highly valuable resource.<ref>[[Richard Dawkins]] (1976), ''The selfish gene'' Oxford University Press, Oxford</ref>  [[Selection]] should therefore in theory favour a quantity of [[ovum|ova]] that would be sufficient for the female lifespan. Over-investment is wasteful of resources, whereas under-investment leads to reduced [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].  Human females, however, spend over one third of their lifespan in a post-reproductive phase.  Possible evolutionary explanations for survival beyond reproductive maturation range from the non-adaptive to the adaptive.

====Non-adaptive hypotheses====
The high cost of female investment in offspring may lead to physiological deteriorations that amplify susceptibility to becoming infertile.  This hypothesis suggests the reproductive lifespan in humans has been optimized, but it has proven more difficult in females and thus their reproductive span is shorter.  If this hypothesis were true however, age at menopause should be negatively correlated with reproductive effort<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gaulin S.J.C. | year = 1980 | title = Sexual Dimorphism in the Human Post-reproductive  Life-span: Possible Causes | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 227–232 | doi = 10.1016/0047-2484(80)90024-X }}</ref> and the available data does not support this.<ref>Holmberg,  I. (1970), "Fecundity, Fertility and Family Planning". Demography Institute University of Gothenburg Reports. 10: 1–109</ref>

A recent increase in female [[longevity]] due to improvements in the standard of living and social care has also been suggested.<ref>Washburn, S.L. (1981). "Longevity in Primates".

====Adaptive hypotheses====

=====The mother hypothesis=====

The mother hypothesis suggests that menopause was selected for in humans because of the extended development period of human offspring and high costs of reproduction so that mothers gain an advantage in reproductive fitness by redirecting their effort from new offspring with a low survival chance to existing children with a higher survival chance.<ref>Peccei, J. S. (2001) "Menopause: Adaptation or Epiphenomenon?" ''Evolutionary Anthropology''  10(2): 43–57 {{doi|10.1002/evan.1013}}</ref>

=====The grandmother hypothesis=====

The [[Grandmother hypothesis]] suggests that menopause was selected for in humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants in the first year of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies and their mothers require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer  societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when mothers and fathers are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during good times, many grandchildren cannot survive without them during times of famine. Arguably, however, there is no firm consensus on the supposed evolutionary advantages (or simply neutrality) of menopause to the survival of the species in the evolutionary past.

Indeed, analysis of historical data found that the length of a female's post-reproductive lifespan was reflected in the reproductive success of her offspring and the survival of her grandchildren.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lahdenperä M., Lummaa V., Helle S., Tremblay M., Russell A. F. | year = 2004 | title = Fitness benefits of prolonged post-reproductive  lifespan in women | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979| pages = 178–181 | doi = 10.1038/nature02367 | pmid = 15014499 }}</ref> Interestingly, another study found comparative effects but only in the maternal grandmother – paternal grandmothers had a detrimental effect on infant mortality (probably due to paternity uncertainty).<ref>Voland, E. and Beise, J. (2002). "Opposite Effects of Maternal and Paternal Grandmothers on Infant Survival in Historical Krummörn". MPIDR WP 2001–026.</ref>  Differing assistance strategies for maternal and paternal grandmothers have also been demonstrated.  Maternal grandmothers concentrate on offspring survival, whereas paternal grandmothers increase birth rates.<ref>Mace, R and Sear, R. (2004). Are Humans Communal Breeders? In: Voland, E., Chasiotis, A. and Schiefenhoevel, W. (eds). Grandmotherhood – the Evolutionary Significance of the Second Half of Female Life. [[Rutgers University Press]].</ref>

A problem concerning the grandmother hypothesis is that it requires a history of female [[philopatry]] and yet present day evidence shows that the majority of hunter-gatherer societies are [[patriarchal]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peccei J. S. | year = 2001 | title = A critique of the grandmother hypotheses: Old and new | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 434–452 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.1076 | pmid = 11400215 }}</ref>  In addition, all variations on the mother, or grandmother effect fail to explain longevity with continued spermatogenesis in males (oldest verified paternity is 94 years, 35 years beyond the oldest documented birth attributed to females).<ref>10.

==Management==
Perimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder, and therefore it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment at all. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the everyday life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.

===Hormone replacement therapy===

:'' See also [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)]]''

In the context of the menopause [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] or HRT (known in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as hormone therapy or HT) is the use of [[estrogen]] plus [[progestin]] for a woman who has an intact uterus, or estrogen alone for a woman who has had a [[hysterectomy]].<ref>The Woman's Health Program Monash University, Oestrogen and Progestin as hormone therapy; http://med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/womenshealth/docs/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy.pdf.</ref> Traditionally such therapy was provided as tablets but now is available in a range of formulations including skin patches, gels, skin sprays, subcutaneous implants and so forth. A popular alternative to conventional HRT is a synthetic hormone (derived from the Mexican yam) called [[tibolone]]. Of the non hormonal therapies for hot flushes, some of the [[SSRIs]] appear to provide some pharmaceutical relief.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans ML, Pritts E, Vittinghoff E, McClish K, Morgan KS, Jaffe RB | year = 2005 | title = Management of postmenopausal hot flushes with venlafaxine hydrochloride: a randomized, controlled trial | url = | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 105 | issue = 1| pages = 161–6 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000147840.06947.46 | pmid = 15625158 }}</ref> Adverse effects of HRT appear to vary according to formulation and dose. See the section below on "Adverse effects of conjugated equine estrogens".

In addition to relief from hot flashes, hormone therapy can alleviate vaginal dryness, improve sleep quality and joint pain. It is also extremely effective for preventing bone loss and [[osteoporosis|osteoporotic]] fracture.<ref>Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of [[The North American Menopause Society]].Menopause. 2010 Mar;17(2):242–55</ref>

A woman and her doctor should carefully review her situation, her complaints and her relative risk before determining whether the benefits of HT/HRT or other therapies outweigh the risks. Until more becomes understood about the possible risks, women who elect to use hormone replacement therapy are generally well advised to take the lowest effective dose of hormones for the shortest period possible, and to question their doctors as to whether certain forms might pose fewer dangers of clots or cancer than others.

Until recently the most widely used estrogen preparation worldwide in postmenopausal women was oral [[Premarin|conjugated equine estrogens]]. Other oral oestrogen preparations include synthetically derived piperazine estrone sulphate, estriol, micronised estradiol and estradiol valerate. Estradiol may also be used transdermally as a patch or gel, as a slow release percutaneous implant, and more recently as a metered dose skin spray. Intravaginal estrogens include topical estradiol in the form of a ring or pessary, estriol in pessary or cream form, dienoestrol and conjugated oestrogens in the form of creams.
Oral micronised estradiol and other oral estrogen preparations may result in up to 10 fold higher levels of circulating [[estrone sulphate]] than transdermally administered estradiol at comparable or even higher doses.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Slater C, Hodis H, Mack W, Shoupe D, Paulson R, Stanczyk F | year = 2001 | title = Markedly elevated levels of estrone sulfate after long term oral, but not transdermal, administration of estradiol in postmenopausal women | url = | journal = Menopause | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 200–3 | doi = 10.1097/00042192-200105000-00009 | pmid = 11355042 }}</ref> This is of concern in that estrogen sensitive tissues such as breast and [[endometrium]] have high capacity to metabolise estrone sulphate through to estradiol. Orally administered estrogen therapy also increases [[Sex hormone-binding globulin|sex hormone binding globulin]] (SHBG) to a greater extent than non orally administered estrogens. SHBG binds estrogen and testosterone in the blood  and this may result in a clinically significant reduction in the bioavailability of these hormones. Thus it would seem that the prescription of oral estrogen therapy should be at the lowest available dose to minimise effects on circulating estrone sulphate and SHBG.

In those women who have no uterus (usually due to a previous hysterectomy), estrogen alone is a suitable hormone therapy and is in fact preferable to continuing to use progesterone when its function as a moderating influence on growth of the [[endometrium]] (uterine lining) is no longer required. Women who still have a uterus need to take ''progesterone'' in addition to estrogen to protect against the development of [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial carcinoma]].

Oral administration of progesterone is convenient, however the oral micronised form is rapidly metabolized and inactivated in the liver, therefore high doses must be administered to achieve adequate circulating blood levels. Synthetic [[progestins]] have been developed and are prescribed to overcome this problem. Synthetic progestins are more resistant to liver metabolism, therefore lower doses can be used to achieve the desired endometrial effect. It is not uncommon for women to experience side effects with progesterone or progestin therapy. Progesterone may cause sedation so is best taken at bedtime.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Arafat E.S., Hargrove J.T., Maxson W.S.

====Conjugated equine estrogens====
{{see also|Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)#Types_of_Hormone_Replacement_Therapy{{!}}Types of Hormone Replacement Therapy}}

Conjugated equine estrogens contain estrogen molecules conjugated to [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] side groups (e.g. sulfate) and are produced from the urine of pregnant Equidae (horses) mares. Premarin is the prime example of this, either alone or in Prempro, where it is combined with a synthetic progestin, [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]].

Women had been advised for many years by numerous doctors and drug company marketing efforts (at least in the USA) that hormone therapy with conjugated equine estrogens after menopause might reduce their risk of [[heart disease]] and prevent various aspects of aging. However, a large, randomized, controlled trial (the [[Women's Health Initiative]]) found that women undergoing HT or HRT with conjugated equine estrogens ([[Premarin]]), in combination with a synthetic progestin (medroxy pogesterone acetate (Premarin plus [[Medroxyprogesterone acetate|Provera]], known as Prempro)), had an increased risk of [[breast cancer]] and heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Writing Group for Women's Health initiative I. | year = | title = Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 2002 | issue = 288| pages = 321–33 }}</ref> An increase in breast cancer risk was not seen in the Women's Health Initiative study of conjugate estrogen alone (Premarin) versus placebo, however this study was stopped prematurely as an increased risk of stroke was observed in women treated with Premarin.<ref name="Anderson GL, Limacher M, Assaf AR et al. 2004 1701–12">{{cite journal | author = Anderson GL, Limacher M, Assaf AR ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Effects of conjugated equine estrogen in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy: the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 291 | issue = 14| pages = 1701–12 | doi = 10.1001/jama.291.14.1701 | pmid = 15082697 }}</ref> Although this increase in risk was small overall, it passed the thresholds that had been established by the researchers in advance as sufficient to ethically require stopping the study.

When these results were first reported in 2002, the popular media sensationalized the story and exaggerated the risk, while the manufacturer continued to attempt to minimize the degree of risk. However most news stories failed to mention that the average age of the women in WHI was 62 years old, significantly older than the time when most women start HRT, and in fact many years into postmenopause. To enroll in the study, patients had to be [[asymptomatic]] of hot flashes, so they would not know whether they received the placebo. For these reasons, WHI was not representative of generally accepted clinical practice.

The 2002 and 2003 announcements of the Women's Health Initiative of the American National Institute of Health and [[The Million Women Study]] of the [[UK]] Cancer Research and [[National Health Service]] collaboration respectively, that HRT treatment coincides with an increased incidence of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes, lead to a sharp decline in HRT prescription throughout the world,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Menon U, Burnell M, Sharma A, ''et al.'' |title=Decline in use of hormone therapy among postmenopausal women in the United Kingdom |journal=Menopause |volume=14 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=462–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17237735 |doi=10.1097/01.gme.0000243569.70946.9d |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Du Y, Dören M, Melchert HU, Scheidt-Nave C, Knopf H |title=Differences in menopausal hormone therapy use among women in Germany between 1998 and 2003 |journal=BMC Womens Health |volume=7|pages=19 |year=2007 |pmid=17945013 |pmc=2233614 |doi=10.1186/1472-6874-7-19 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Watson J, Wise L, Green J |title=Prescribing of hormone therapy for menopause, tibolone, and bisphosphonates in women in the UK between 1991 and 2005 |journal=Eur.

On hearing the news about the WHI study, many women discontinued equine estrogens altogether, with or without their doctor's knowledge. The number of prescriptions written for Premarin and PremPro in the United States dropped within a year almost to half of their previous level. This sharp drop in usage was followed by large and successively larger drops in new breast cancer diagnoses, at six months, one year, and 18 months after the drop in Premarin and Prempro prescriptions, for a cumulative 15% drop by the end of 2003. However, the apparent meaning of this correlation is called into question by the fact that prescriptions of Prempro and Premarin fell dramatically in Canada as well, but no similarly dramatic drop in Canada's [[breast cancer]] rates was observed during the same time period. Studies designed to track the further progression of this trend after 2003 are under way, as well as studies designed to quantify how much of the drop was related to the reduced use of HT/HRT.<ref name="Anderson GL, Limacher M, Assaf AR et al. 2004 1701–12"/>

The WHI study results have created a new scenario for postmenopausal women.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Pérez-López FR, Chedraui P, Gilbert JJ, Pérez-Roncero G|title=Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and prevalent related co-morbid conditions: facing the post-Women's Health Initiative era. |journal=Fertil Steril |volume = 92 | number = 4 | pages = 1171–1186 | year = 2009|pmid=19700149}}</ref>

Researchers at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are currently undergoing a study to determine if estrogen replacement therapy can improve cardiovascular health and prevent depression in perimenopausal women between the ages of 45 and 55.<ref>[http://www.med.unc.edu/psych/wmd/research/perimenopausal-research-studies UNC Perimenopausal Estrogen Replacement Therapy Study]</ref>  Dr. David Rubinow, UNC's chair of Psychiatry, and one of two principal investigators on the NIH-funded 5-year study, notes there is a very important difference between the UNC study and the WHI estrogen study.  Dr. Rubinow states that "the Women's Health Initiative study led to the mistaken belief that estrogen replacement therapy is bad for all women.  And as a result, it has served to deprive some women of a treatment that might greatly and favorably impact their lives.  Much of the negative impact of estrogen that they found was related to the fact that most of the women in the Women's Health Initiative study were far past the menopause and up to 79 years old."  Dr. Rubinow continues by explaining that "there are now a large number of studies that demonstrate what has been called the timing hypothesis. That is, giving estrogen within a year or two of menopause has beneficial effects, but giving estrogen in women more than five years beyond the menopause can actually be harmful.  When the women who were close to menopause were looked at separately, the adverse effects on the heart were not seen and in fact some suggestion of beneficial effects was seen.  Perimenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative who received estrogen had significantly lower coronary artery calcification compared to the women who didn't take estrogen."  As Dr. Rubinow states, "given the mortality and morbidity associated with depression and heart disease, and the tremendous increase in risk of these disorders during the perimenopause, it is critical that we identify those women who will be helped by estradiol."<ref>[http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2011/January/estradiol UNC Health Care.org]</ref>

===Selective estrogen receptor modulators===
SERMs are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source ([[phytoserm]]s), that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the [[estrogen receptor]]s throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are [[raloxifene]] and [[tamoxifen]]. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Davis SR, Dinatale I, Rivera-Woll L, Davison SR|title=Postmenopausal hormone therapy: from monkey glands to transdermal patches|journal=JEndocrinol|volume=185|issue=2|pages=207–22|year=2005|pmid=15845914|doi=10.1677/joe.1.05847}}</ref> Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer.

===Antidepressants===
Antidepressants such as [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), [[Fluoxetine hydrochloride]] ([[Prozac]]), and [[Venlafaxine hydrochloride]] ([[Effexor]]) have been used with some success in the treatment of hot flashes, improving sleep, mood, and quality of life. Paroxetine and venlafaxine may cause nausea and insomnia. In addition, venlafaxine may cause dry mouth, constipation and decreased appetite whereas paroxetine may cause headaches. There is a theoretical reason why [[SSRI]] antidepressants might help with memory problems: they increase circulating levels of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] in the brain and restore hippocampal function.<ref>*Rosack, Jim. [http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=105594 "Antidepressants May Prevent Hippocampus From Shrinking"], ''Psychiatric News'', Volume 38 Number 17 Page 24, September 5, 2003.</ref> [[Fluoxetine hydrochloride]] (Sarafem) is also prescribed for [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD), a mood disorder often exacerbated during perimenopause.

===Gabapentin===
Gabapentin (sometimes called by its brand name, '''Neurontin''') and other GABA analogs are anti-seizure medications.  Several GABA analogs are prescribed off-label for a variety of other conditions (such as [[pregabalin]] being used to treat the symptoms of [[fibromyalgia]] under the brand name '''Lyrica'''); gabapentin itself has been shown to be as effective as estrogen at reducing hot flashes.<ref>[http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=1171 URMC.rochester.edu]</ref>

===Blood pressure medicines===
Blood pressure medicines including [[clonidine]] (Catapres) are about as effective as antidepressants for hot flashes, but do not have the other mind and mood benefits of antidepressants. However they may merit special consideration by women suffering both from high blood pressure and hot flashes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thacker |first1=H |year=2011 |title=Assessing risks and benefits of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. |journal=J.

===Alternative medicine===
Some botanical sources, referred to as [[phytoestrogens]], do not simply mimic the effects of human steroidal estrogen but exhibit both similar and divergent actions. The ultimate actions of these compounds in specific cells is determined by many factors including the relative levels of the estrogen receptors ER alpha and beta and the diverse mix of coactivators and corepressors present in any given cell type. Thus they have been described to act somewhat like [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s (SERMs). Effects vary according to the phytoestrogen studied, cell line, tissue, species and response being evaluated.<ref>Murkies, A., Wilcox, G Davis SR Phytoestrogens: A Clinical Review  J.Clin.Endocrinol Metab 1998; 83: 297–303|pmid=9467531</ref>

There are regular claims that soy isoflavones are beneficial concerning some symptoms of menopause.

===Education===
Many women arrive at their menopause transition years without knowing anything about what they might expect, or when or how the process might happen, and how long it might take. Very often a woman has not been informed in any way about this stage of life; at least in the US, it may often be the case that she has received no information from her physician, or from her older female family members, or from her social group. In the US, there appears to be a lingering [[taboo]] which hangs over this subject. As a result, a woman who happens to undergo a strong perimenopause with a large number of different effects, may become confused and anxious, fearing that something abnormal is happening to her. There is a strong need for more information and more education on this subject.<ref name="pmid17970860"/>

===Other therapies===
*Lack of lubrication is a common problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women feel unpleasantly dry all of the time apart from during sex, and they may do better with moisturizers all of the time. Those who need only lubricants are fine just using the lubrication products during intercourse.

*Low-dose prescription vaginal estrogen products such as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and dryness problems (see [[vaginal atrophy]]) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.

*In terms of managing hot flashes, lifestyle measures, such as drinking cold liquids, staying in cool rooms, using fans, removing excess clothing layers when a hot flash strikes, and avoiding hot flash triggers such as hot drinks, spicy foods, etc., may partially supplement (or even obviate) the use of medications for some women.

*Individual counseling or support groups can sometimes be helpful to handle sad, depressed, anxious or confused feelings women may be having as they pass through what can be for some a very challenging transition time.

*[[Osteoporosis]] can be minimized by [[smoking cessation]], adequate [[vitamin D]] intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphate drug alendronate can help prevent loss of bone mass, reducing the risk of fractures, according to a Cochrane review of studies. This applies both to women that have suffered bone loss but have not yet suffered fractures, and women that have suffered both bone loss and fractures.<ref>Wells GA, Cranney A, Peterson J, Boucher M, Shea B, Welch V, Coyle D, Tugwell P.

No.: CD001155. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD001155.pub2}}</ref>

*The risk of [[acute myocardial infarction]] and other [[cardiovascular disease]]s rises sharply after menopause, but the risk can be reduced by managing risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, increased [[blood lipid]]s and body weight.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Pérez-López FR, Chedraui P, Gilbert JJ, Pérez-Roncero G|title=Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and prevalent related co-morbid conditions: facing the post-Women's Health Initiative era.|journal= Fertil Steril |volume = 92 |number = 4 | pages = 1171–1186 | year = 2009|pmid=19700149}}</ref><ref name=ESHRE2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr020}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
The cultural context within which a woman lives can have a significant impact on the way she experiences the menopausal transition. Menopause has been described as a subjective experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived. Research has shown Japanese women experience menopause, or konenki as it is called in Japan, in vastly different ways then American women.<ref name="Lock 1998, pp. 410">Lock, M 1998, ‘Menopause: lessons from Anthropology’, Psychosomatic Medicine, vol. 60, no. 4, pp. 410 – 419.</ref> Japanese women report lower rates of common symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, which can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, konenki was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, a “luxury disease” that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households had no time for. This perception constructs menopause as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a “revolutionary transition”, or a “deficiency disease” in need of management.<ref name="Lock 1998, pp. 410"/>

Within the United States, social location affects the way women perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.<ref>Winterich, J. (August, 2008). "Gender, medicine, and the menopausal body: How biology and culture influence women's experiences with menopause".

Ethnicity and geographical location also play a role in the experience of menopause. U.S. women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avis N., Stellato R.

Generally speaking, women raised in the [[Western world]] live long enough so that a third of their life is spent in post-menopause. For some women, the menopausal transition represents a major life change, similar to [[menarche]] in the magnitude of its social and psychological significance. Although the significance of the changes that surround menarche is  fairly well recognized, in countries such as the USA, the social and psychological ramifications of the menopause transition are frequently ignored or underestimated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==In other animals==
Menopause in the animal kingdom appears to be uncommon, but the presence of this phenomenon in different species has not been thoroughly researched. [[Biological life cycle|Life histories]] show a varying degree of [[senescence]]; rapid senescing organisms (e.g. [[Pacific salmon]] and [[annual plants]]) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage.  Gradual senescence is exhibited by all [[placental mammal]]ian life histories.

Menopause has been observed in several species of nonhuman [[primates]],<ref name="Walker2"/> including [[rhesus monkeys]],<ref name="Walker">{{cite journal|author=Walker ML|title=Menopause in female rhesus monkeys|journal=Am J Primatol|volume=35|pages=59–71|year=1995 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.1350350106}}</ref> and [[chimpanzees]].<ref>Bowden, D.M. and Williams, D.D.
