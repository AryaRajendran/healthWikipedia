'''Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana''' (WAMM) is a non-profit [[medicinal cannabis]] dispensing collective located in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  WAMM was founded in 1993 by Valerie Leveroni Corral and her then husband Michael Corral.  Members receive medicinal cannabis in exchange for volunteer work.  There is no charge for members who are too ill to work.<ref>Luker, Kelly, Metro, 3-14-'02 [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/03.14.02/cover/marijuana-0211.html The Secret Garden]</ref> WAMM is the first [[medical marijuana]] collective to receive [[non-profit]] status from the [[United States Government]].<ref>Nieves, Evelyn, Mother Jones, Jan/Feb ’01 [http://motherjones.com/politics/2001/01/half-ounce-healing Half an Ounce of Healing]</ref>

==Early Days==
WAMM’s farm was purchased with $40,000 that [[Valerie Corral]] received as a settlement for an automobile accident that left her [[epileptic]]. The Corrals were raided by local police in 1992 and 1993, but all charges were subsequently dismissed.

==DEA Raid==
WAMM was raided by the federal [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) on September 5, 2002. Approximately 150 cannabis plants were destroyed. During the raid, polio patient Suzanne Pfeil was handcuffed behind her back after explaining to officers that she could not get out of bed due to her medical condition.<ref>Pfeil, Suzanne, 11-17-’04 [http://books.google.com/books?id=KCR3Vw0pUJkC&pg=PA23718&lpg=PA23718&dq=%22wo/men%27s+alliance+for+medical+marijuana%22&source=bl&ots=nNpxnRCWxy&sig=IY_ivEgSW87HbBK5YnBeKhxQi28&hl=en&ei=nFdnTKCgO4G8sAOpmODLDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&q=%22wo%2Fmen%27s%20alliance%20for%20medical%20marijuana%22&f=false Congressional Record, United States Senate]</ref>  The raid was condemned by many high profile individuals, including then-California Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]], Emily Rielly, former Vice Mayor of Santa Cruz, and all members of the [[Santa Clara County]] Board of Supervisors that were serving at the time.<ref>Santa Cruz Sentinel, 9-11’02,  [http://www.mapinc.org/newscsdp/v02/n1712/a07.html County, City Condemn DEA Marijuana Raid]</ref><ref>Lypps, Heidi, CounterPunch, 9-17-‘02 [http://www.counterpunch.org/lypps0917.html The Crackdown on Medical Marijuana]</ref>

===Support from City of Santa Cruz===
The City of Santa Cruz has been explicitly supportive of WAMM and its activities.  Following the 2002 raid, WAMM was permitted to dispense medicinal cannabis to its members on the steps of City Hall.<ref>Ritter, John, USA Today [http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-09-16-raid-usat_x.htm Pot raid angers state, patients]</ref><ref>LeDuff, Charlie, Liptak, Adam, New York Times, 9-18-'02  [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/national/18POT.html?ex=1224820800&en=1d81e4a5aa36f6b3&ei=5070 Defiant California City Hands Out Marijuana]</ref><ref>Krohn, Christopher, New York Times, 9-21-'02 [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/21/opinion/why-i-m-fighting-federal-drug-laws-from-city-hall.html?sec=health&&scp=8&sq=valerie%20corral&st=cse Why I'm Fighting Federal Drug Laws From City Hall]</ref> In 2003, in solidarity with the collective, the City of Santa Cruz sued the federal government for raiding WAMM.  The case is called ''Santa Cruz v. Mukasey''.

===Judge Fogel’s Rulings===
In 2004, Federal Judge Jeremy Fogel denied the government’s motion to dismiss the Plaintiff’s (WAMM’s) complaint.  This ruling allowed WAMM to continue cultivating medicinal cannabis while the lawsuit was pending. In 2008, Judge Fogel ruled in favor of WAMM in ''Santa Cruz v. Mukasey''.  Fogel used reasoning from the earlier ''Conant v. Walters'' case to partially guide his decision.  The ''Conant'' decision stated, "Applied to our situation, this means that, much as the federal government may prefer that California keep medical marijuana illegal, it cannot force the state to do so."<ref>American Civil Liberties Union, 8-20-‘08 [http://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform/federal-court-rules-us-government-may-not-deliberately-subvert-california%E2%80%99s-medical- Federal Court Rules US Government May Not Deliberately Subvert California’s Medical Marijuana Laws]</ref>

==Praise==
Speaking with CBS News, A WAMM attorney, Gerald Uleman stated that "Representing Valerie Corral, for me, is like representing [[Mother Teresa]]," and he called her "one of the most [[compassionate]] people I've ever met."<ref>de Vries, Lloyd, CBS News, 5-24-‘04  [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/24/health/main619226.shtml Not Your Average Pot Proponent]</ref> [[Drug Policy Alliance]] director [[Ethan Nadelmann]] also likened Corral to Mother Teresa.

==All Ages==
In 2009, WAMM director Valerie Corral stated that the collective had about 2 dozen [[Minor (law)|minors]] as members.<ref>Ellison, Katherine, New York Times, 11-21-’09 [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/health/22sfmedical.html Medical Marijuana: No Longer Just for Adults]</ref>

==Lawsuit Dismissed==
In January, 2010, WAMM dismissed their lawsuit against the federal government.  WAMM counsel Allen Hopper cited a 2009 policy change in the [[Obama Administration]] that gave the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] more discretion with regard to medical marijuana busts.<ref>Oregon NORML, 1-22-'10 [http://ornorml.org/node/69 Settlement reached in County of Santa Cruz v.

==Expired Memberships==
Between the years 1993 and 2010, 223 members of WAMM died.<ref>Hecht, Peter, Sacramento Bee, 8-13-‘10 [http://blogs.sacbee.com/weed-wars/2010/08/co-founder-of-pioneering-collective-decries-pot-shop-industry.html medical marijuana pioneer protests cash cow pot shops]</ref>
