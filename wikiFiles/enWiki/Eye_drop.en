'''Eye drops''' are [[saline (medicine)|saline]]-containing [[Drop (liquid)|drop]]s used as an [[Human eye|ocular]] [[Route of administration|route to administer]]. Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain [[steroid]]s, [[antihistamine]]s, [[sympathomimetic]]s, [[Beta blocker|beta receptor blocker]]s, [[parasympathomimetic]]s, [[parasympatholytic]]s, [[prostaglandin]]s, [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) or [[topical anesthetic]]s. Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and [[Tears|tear]]-replacing solutions.

Eye drops have less of a risk of side effects than do oral medicines, and such risk can be minimized by occluding the [[lacrimal punctum]], (i.e. pressing on the inner corner of the eye) for a short while after instilling drops.

== Shelf life ==
Most pharmacists recommend disposal of most types of eyedrops after 28 days as they are only stable in solution for 28 days{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

== Types and uses ==
Different pharmacological classes of eye drops can be recognized by patients by their different colored tops. For instance the tops to dilating drops are a different color than anti-allergy drops.

===Ophthalmic administration===

====Rinse eye drops====
Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear-replacing solutions.

====Drug administration====

=====Dry eye treatment=====
There is a wide variety of '''artificial''' tear eye drops that provide different surface [[healing]] strategies. One can find '''bicarbonate ions''', [[Hypotonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonicity]], [[viscosity]], and non-preserved types. They all act differently and therefore, one should try different artificial tears to find the one that best works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agingeye.net/dryeyes/dryeyesdrugtreatment.php| title=Artificial Tears|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>

=====Steroid and antibiotic eye drops=====
'''Steroid''' and '''antibiotic eye drops''' are used to treat eye [[infections]]. They also have [[prophylactic]] properties and  are used to prevent infections after eye surgeries. They should be used for the entire time prescribed without interruptions. The infection may relapse if the use of the medication is stopped.<ref name="medicinenet">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/steroid_and_antibiotic_eye_drops/article.htm| title=Generic Name: Steroid and Antibiotic Eye Drops|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>

=====Glaucoma eye drops=====
Eye drops used in managing [[glaucoma]] help the eye's [[fluid]] to drain better and decrease the amount of fluid made by the eye which decreases '''eye pressure'''. They are classified by their active ingredient and they include: [[prostaglandin analogs]], [[beta blockers]], '''alpha agonists''', and [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]]. There are also combination drugs available for those patients who require more than one type of medication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glaucoma.org/treating/glaucoma_medica.php| title=Glaucoma Medications and Their Side Effects|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>

=====Allergy eye relief eye drops=====
Some eye drops may contain [[histamine antagonists]] or [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]], which suppress the optical mast cell responses to allergens including (but not limited to) aerosolized dust particles.

=====Pink eye or conjunctivitis eye drops=====
Antibiotic eye drops are prescribed when [[conjunctivitis]] is caused by bacteria but not when it is caused by a virus. In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, artificial tears can help dilute irritating allergens present in the tear film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/conjunctivitis.htm#treatment| title=Pink Eye (Conjunctivitis) Treatments|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>

=====Mydriatic eye drops=====
These make the eye's [[pupil]] widen to maximum, to let an [[optician]] have the best view inside the [[eyeball]] behind the iris. Afterwards in sunny weather they can cause dazzling and [[photophobia]] until the effect of the [[mydriatic]] has worn off.

In Russia, Tropicamide, a mydriatic eye drop, is used to some degree as an inexpensive recreational drug. Like other anticholinergics, when taken recreationally, tropicamide acts as a deliriant. According to one reporter, when injected intravenously, as is most often the case, the drug often "brings on suicidal feelings."

===Injection/ophthalmic drug administration===
Syringe designed saline drops (e.g. Wallace Cameron Ultra Saline Minipod) are distributed in modern [[needle-exchange programme]]s as they can be used efficiently either by injection or ophthalmic (if the drug is potent in small doses) route of administer which is compared to intravenous use; By demonstration, the elimination of latanoprost acid from plasma is rapid (half-life 17 minutes) after either ophthalmic or intravenous administration.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/mmx/latanoprost.html</ref>

==Side effects==
[[File:Man taking eyedrops.jpg|thumb|right|Man applying eye drops]]
Steroid and antibiotic eye drops may cause stinging for one or two minutes when first used and if stinging continues, medical advice should be sought. Also, one should tell their doctor if vision changes occur or if they experience persistent [[sore throat]], [[fever]], easy [[bleeding]] or [[bruising]] when using drops with [[chloramphenicol]]. Also, one should be aware of symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as: [[rash]], [[itching]], [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[dizziness]], and trouble breathing.<ref name="medicinenet"/> 

Prostaglandin analogs may cause changes in [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] color and [[eyelid]] skin, growth of [[eyelashes]], stinging, [[blurred vision]], eye redness, itching, and burning. Beta blockers' side effects include [[low blood pressure]], reduced [[pulse rate]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], shortness of breath, and in rare occasions, reduced [[libido]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Alpha agonists can cause burning or stinging, fatigue, [[headache]], [[drowsiness]], [[dry mouth]] and [[Human nose|nose]], and also they have a higher likelihood of allergic reaction. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may cause stinging, burning, and eye discomfort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glaucoma.org/treating/glaucoma_medica.php| title=Side Effects|date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>

Lubricant eye drops may cause some side effects and one should consult a doctor if pain in the eye or changes in vision occur.  Furthermore, when redness occurs but lasts more than 3 days, one should immediately consult a doctor.
