'''Medical school in the United States''' is a four year graduate institution with the purpose of educating physicians in the field of [[medicine]]. It provides a major part of the [[medical education in the United States]]. Graduates receive either an [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) or a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) degree. 

==History==
In 1910, the [[Flexner Report]] reported on the state of medical education in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The report was written by [[Abraham Flexner]] and published in 1910 under the aegis of the [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]. It set standards and reformed American medical education.

==Admissions==
In general, admission into a US medical school is considered highly competitive, and typically requires completion of a four-year [[bachelor's degree]] or at least 90 credit hours from an accredited college or university. Many applicants obtain further education before medical school in the form of [[Master's degrees]], or other non science related degrees. Admissions criteria may include overall performance in the undergraduate years and performance in a group of courses specifically required by U.S. medical schools ([[pre-health sciences]]), the score on the [[Medical College Admission Test]] (MCAT), application essays, letters of recommendation (most schools require either one letter from the undergraduate institution's premedical advising committee or a combination of letters from at least one science faculty and one non-science faculty), and interviews. 

Beyond objective admissions criteria, many programs look for candidates who have had unique experiences in community service, volunteer-work, international studies, [[research]], or other advanced degrees. The application essay is the primary opportunity for the candidate to describe his/her reasons for entering a medical career.  The essay requirements are usually open-ended to allow creativity and flexibility for the candidate to draw upon his/her personal experiences/challenges to make him/her stand out amongst other applicants.  If granted, an interview serves as an additional way to express these subjective strengths that a candidate may possess.

Since 2005, the Association of Medical Colleges has recommended that all medical schools conduct background checks on applicants in order to prevent individuals with convictions for serious crimes from being matriculated.<ref>Appel, Jacob M. "Should Convicted Murderers Practice Medicine?" Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, Vol. 19, No. 4, Oct. 2010</ref>  

Most commonly, the bachelor degree is in one of the biological sciences, but not always; in 2005, nearly 40% of medical school matriculates had received bachelor's degrees in fields other than biology or specialized health sciences.<ref>[http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/2005/mcatgpabymaj1.htm AAMC: FACTS - Applicants, Matriculants and Graduates]</ref> All medical school applicants must, however, complete year-length undergraduate courses with labs in biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics; some medical schools have additional requirements such as biochemistry, calculus, genetics, psychology and English. Many of these courses have prerequisites, so there are other "hidden" course requirements (basic science courses) that are often taken first.

A student with a bachelor's degree who has not taken the [[pre-medical]] coursework may complete a postbaccalaureate (postbacc) program.  Such programs allow rapid fulfillment of prerequisite course work as well as grade point average improvement.  Some postbacc programs are specifically linked to individual medical schools to allow matriculation without a gap year, while most require 1–2 years to complete.

Several universities<ref>[http://services.aamc.org/currdir/section3/degree2.cfm?data=yes&program=bsmd AAMC: Schools Offering Combined Degree Programs in BS/MD]</ref> across the U.S. admit college students to their medical schools during college; students attend a single six-year to eight-year integrated program consisting of two to four years of an undergraduate curriculum and four years of medical school curriculum, culminating in both a bachelor's and M.D. degree or a bachelor's and D.O. degree. Some of these programs admit high school students to college and medical school.

While not necessary for admission, several private organizations have capitalized on this complex and involved process by offering services ranging from single-component preparation (MCAT, essay, etc.) to entire application review/consultation.

In 2011, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering U.S.-based M.D. programs were 31.1 and 3.67,<ref>{{cite web|title=Table 17: MCAT Scores and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools, 2000 -2011|url=https://www.aamc.org/download/161690/data/table17.pdf|publisher=[[American Association of Medical Colleges|AAMC]]|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> respectively, and 26.51 and 3.50 for D.O. matriculants, although the gap has been getting smaller every year.<ref>{{cite web|title=AACOMAS Matriculant Profile: 2011 Entering Class|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/applicantsmatriculants/Documents/2011Matriculantsummary.pdf|publisher=[[American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|AACOM]]|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> In 2012, 45,266 people applied to medical schools in the United States through the American Medical College Application Service. Of these 45,266 students, 19,517 of them matriculated into a medical school for a success rate of 43%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Table 18: MCAT and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools by Primary Undergraduate Major, 2012|url=https://www.aamc.org/download/321496/data/2012factstable18.pdf|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>  This figure does not account for the attrition rate of pre-med students in various stages of the pre-application process (those who ultimately do not decide to apply due to weeding out by low GPA, low MCAT, lack of clinical and research experience, and numerous other factors).

==Curriculum==
{{further2|[[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States]]}}

Once admitted to medical school, it generally takes four years to complete a [[Doctor of Medicine]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]), or [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] ([[D.O.]]) degree program. However, at least two schools, [[Texas Tech University]] and the [[Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Candace|coauthors=Mullan, Fitzhugh|title=The separate osteopathic medical education pathway: uniquely addressing national needs. Point.|journal=Academic medicine|year=2009|month=June|volume=84|issue=6|pages=695|pmid=19474535|url=http://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/prehealth/PMED/PMED_300/Applying/The_Separate_Osteopathic_Medical_Education.8.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2012|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181a3dd28}}</ref> are now offering a three year accelerated program for those students going into [[primary care]].<ref>{{cite web|title=F-MAT Family Medicine Accelerated Track|url=http://www.ttuhsc.edu/som/fammed/fmat/|work=Family Medicine|publisher=Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> The course of study is divided into two roughly equal components: pre-clinical and clinical.  

''Preclinical'' study comprises the first one to two years and consists of classroom and laboratory instruction in core subjects such as [[anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], [[physiology]], [[pharmacology]], [[histology]], [[embryology]], [[microbiology]], [[pathology]], [[pathophysiology]], and [[neurosciences]]. Once students successfully complete preclinical training, they generally take step one of the medical licensing boards, the [[USMLE Step 1|USMLE]], or the [[COMLEX]].

The ''clinical'' component usually occupies the final two to three years of medical school and takes place almost exclusively on the wards of a [[teaching hospital]] or, occasionally, with community-based physicians. The students observe and take part in the care of patients under the supervision of [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] and attending physicians.  [[Clerkship (medicine)|Rotations]] (also known as clerkships) are required in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[family medicine]], [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]], [[neurology]], and [[psychiatry]]. Beyond these, a variable number of specialty electives are required. Additionally, students are generally required to take a [[sub-internship (medicine)|sub-internship]] rotation where they will perform duties at the intern level.  During the fourth year, most medical students take Step 2 of the medical licensing boards (USMLE [[USMLE Step 2-CK|Clinical Knowledge]] & [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills|Clinical Skills]] [for M.D.], or COMLEX Cognitive Evaluation & Performance Evaluation [for D.O.]).  

Many medical schools also offer joint degree programs in which some medical students may simultaneously enroll in master's or doctoral-level programs in related fields such as a [[Masters in Business Administration]], [[Master of Healthcare Administration|Masters in Healthcare Administration]], [[Master of Public Health|Masters in Public Health]], [[Juris Doctor|JD]], [[Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy]], and Masters in Health Communication. Some schools such as the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Medical College of South Carolina both offer an integrated radiology curriculum during their respective MD Programs led by investigators of the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] study.

Upon completion of medical school, the student gains the title of doctor and the degree of M.D. or D.O., but cannot practice independently until completing at least an [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and also Step 3 of the [[USMLE Step 3|USMLE]] (for M.D.) or COMLEX (for D.O.). Doctors of Medicine and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine have an equal scope of practice in the United States, with some osteopathic physicians supplementing their practice with principles of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]].

==Grading==

Medical schools use a variety of different grading methods.  Even within one school, the grading of the basic sciences and clinical clerkships may vary.  Most medical schools use the pass/fail schema, rather than letter grades; however the range of grading intervals varies.  The following are examples of grades used with different intervals:<ref>[http://services.aamc.org/currdir/section1/grading1.cfm AAMC: Grading Intervals]</ref>
* 2 Intervals = Pass/Fail
* 3 Intervals = Honors/Pass/Fail
* 4 Intervals = Honors/High Pass/Pass/Fail (or ABCF)
* 5 Intervals = Honors/High Pass/Pass/Low Pass/Fail (or ABCDF)

In addition, a Medical School Performance Evaluation, also called Dean's letter, more specifically describes the performance of a student during medical school.<ref>[http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/careerplan/appdoc.htm McGill] - Medical School Performance Evaluation (Dean's Letter)</ref>

==Accreditation==

All medical schools within the United States must be accredited by one of two organizations.  The [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME), jointly administered by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] and the [[American Medical Association]], accredits M.D. schools,<ref>Wiebe, Christina. [http://www.amsa.org/tnp/articles/article.cfx?id=308 ''The LCME at a Glance'']. The New Physician, [[American Medical Student Association]]. December 1999. accessed 4 Nov 2007.</ref> while the [[Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation]] of the [[American Osteopathic Association]] accredits osteopathic (D.O.) schools.  There are presently 141 M.D. programs<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Schools|url=https://www.aamc.org/about/medicalschools/|publisher=American Association of Medical Colleges|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> and 29 D.O. programs<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|url=http://www.aacom.org/about/colleges/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=AACOM|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> in the United States.

Accreditation is required for a school's students to receive federal loans.  Additionally, schools must be accredited to receive federal funding for medical education.<ref>[http://www.lcme.org/faqlcme.htm LCME: Frequently Asked Questions]</ref>  The M.D. and D.O. are the only medical degrees offered in the United States which are listed in the WHO/IMED list of medical schools.

== Indebtedness of medical graduates ==
Unlike many other countries, U.S. medical students finance their education with personal debt. In 1992, the average debt of a medical doctor after residency, for those graduating with debt, was $25,000. For the Class of 2009, the average debt of a medical student is $157,990, with 25.1% of students having debt in excess of $200,000 (prior to residency). For the past decade, tuition prices have increased 5-6% each year- it is not clear what has caused these increases.<ref>[http://www.aamc.org/members/gsa/meetings/dreconomics.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> 

Medical schools do not have accounting transparency, so it is difficult to pin-point the root cause of tuition increases.<ref>JAMA. 2000 Sep 6;284(9):1136-8.</ref> Medical education is still based on the 2 + 2 model posited by the 100 year old [[Flexner report]].

A current economic theory suggests that increasing borrowing limits have been the cause of the increased tuition. As medical students are allowed to borrow more, medical schools raise tuition prices to maximally increase revenue.  Studies show that schools raise prices 97 cents for each one dollar increase in borrowing capacity.<ref>[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3344 Making College More Expensive: The Unintended Consequences of Federal Tuition Aid | Gary Wolfram | Cato Institute: Policy Analysis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

There is no consensus on whether the level of debt carried by medical students has a strong effect on their choice of medical specialty. Dr. Herbert Pardes and others have suggested that medical school debt has been a direct cause of the US primary care shortage.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703574604574499423536935290.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Herbert | last=Pardes | title=The Coming Shortage of Doctors | date=6 November 2009}}</ref>  Some research suggests that for a sub-set of debt sensitive medical students, this is certainly the case.  For most students, debt is but one consideration in choosing a residency. Whatever the cause may be, the 2008 Family Medicine Residency match filled only 44% of available slots with US graduates, down from the 1984 level of 98%.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/101481.php Family Medicine Surges In 2008 Match Results<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Academic health centers ==

Medical schools reside inside complex multi-purpose institutions known as academic health centers.  Academic health centers aim to educate medical students and residents, provide top quality patient care, and perform cutting-edge research. Since medical students are educated inside academic health centers, it is impossible to separate the finances from other operations inside the center.  Funding for medical students—and higher graduate medical education—comes from several sources above and beyond personal debt financing.<ref>Complexity and Uncertainty in Financing Medical Education. Acad Med. 2002 Nov;77(11):1076-83.</ref>  

* [[DGME]] (Direct Graduate Medical Education- 2.2 billion in 2002) financing payments under the auspices of Medicare/Medicaid. This funding was altered by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.  Each hospital receives payment based on how many Full Time Equivalent Residents are being trained.
* IME ([[Indirect Medical Education]] - 6.2 billion in 2002) adjustment.  This payment compensates teaching hospitals for their higher Medicare inpatient hospital operating costs due to a number of factors.
* Managed care and insurance organizations reimburse at a higher rate for teaching hospitals, explicitly acknowledging the higher costs of the academic health center.
* The vast majority of revenues come from third-party payers reimbursing for patient care, usually through the Faculty Service Plan.
* Incentive programs such as the MSTP ([[Medical Scientist Training Program]]), NHSC ([[National Health Service Corps]]), [[Armed Services Health Profession Scholarship]] and now the [[Income Based Repayment Plan]].
* Many academic health centers in the U.S. are tied to undergraduate university systems while others solely focus on graduate medicine, training, research, and education.
