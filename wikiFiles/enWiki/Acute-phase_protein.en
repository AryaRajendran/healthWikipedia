'''Acute-phase proteins''' are a class of [[protein]]s whose plasma concentrations increase (positive acute-phase proteins) or decrease (negative acute-phase proteins) in response to [[inflammation]]. This response is called the ''acute-phase reaction'' (also called acute-phase response).
[[Image:Segmented neutrophils.jpg|thumb|120px|Inflammatory cells and [[red blood cell]]s]]
In response to injury, local [[inflammation|inflammatory]] cells ([[neutrophil granulocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s) secrete a number of [[cytokine]]s into the bloodstream, most notable of which are the [[interleukin]]s [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], and [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-α]].  The [[liver]] responds by producing a large number of '''acute-phase reactants'''. At the same time, the production of a number of other proteins is reduced; these are, therefore, referred to as "negative" acute-phase reactants. Increased acute phase proteins from the liver may also contribute to the promotion of [[sepsis]].

==Positive==
Positive acute-phase proteins serve different physiological functions for the [[immune system]]. Some act to destroy or inhibit growth of microbes, e.g., [[C-reactive protein]], [[mannose-binding protein]],<ref>B L Herpers, H Endeman, B A W de Jong, B M de Jongh, J C Grutters, D H Biesma, and H van Velzen-Blad. Acute-phase responsiveness of mannose-binding lectin in community-acquired pneumonia is highly dependent upon MBL2 genotypes. Clin Exp Immunol. 2009 Jun;156(3):488-94. PMID 19438602</ref> [[complement factors]], [[ferritin]], [[ceruloplasmin]], [[Serum amyloid A]] and [[haptoglobin]]. Others give [[negative feedback]] on the inflammatory response, e.g. [[serpin]]s. [[Alpha 2-macroglobulin]] and coagulation factors affect coagulation, mainly stimulating it. This pro-coagulant effect may limit infection by trapping pathogens in local blood clots. Also, some products of the coagulation system can contribute to the [[innate immune system]] by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as [[chemotactic agent]]s for [[phagocytic cell]]s.

==Negative==
"Negative" acute-phase proteins decrease in inflammation. Examples include [[albumin]],<ref name=Ritchie>{{cite journal |author=Ritchie RF, Palomaki GE, Neveux LM, Navolotskaia O, Ledue TB, Craig WY |title=Reference distributions for the negative acute-phase serum proteins, albumin, transferrin, and transthyretin: a practical, simple and clinically relevant approach in a large cohort |journal=J. Clin. Lab. Anal. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=273–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10633294 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2825(1999)13:6<273::AID-JCLA4>3.0.CO;2-X}}</ref> [[transferrin]],<ref name=Ritchie/> [[transthyretin]],<ref name=Ritchie/> [[retinol-binding protein]], [[antithrombin]], [[transcortin]]. The decrease of such proteins may be used as markers of inflammation. The physiological role of decreased synthesis of such proteins is generally to save [[amino acid]]s for producing "positive" acute-phase proteins more efficiently. Theoretically, a decrease in transferrin could additionally be decreased by an upregulation of [[transferrin receptor]]s, but the latter does not appear to change with inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chua E, Clague JE, Sharma AK, Horan MA, Lombard M |title=Serum transferrin receptor assay in iron deficiency anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease in the elderly |journal=QJM |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=587–94 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10627880 |doi= |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/10/587.full}}</ref>

==Clinical significance==
Measurement of acute-phase proteins, especially C-reactive protein, is a useful marker of inflammation in both medical and veterinary [[clinical pathology]]. It correlates with the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR).

They may also indicate liver failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ananian P, Hardwigsen J, Bernard D, Le Treut YP |title=Serum acute-phase protein level as indicator for liver failure after liver resection |journal=Hepatogastroenterology |volume=52 |issue=63 |pages=857–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15966220 |doi=}}</ref>
