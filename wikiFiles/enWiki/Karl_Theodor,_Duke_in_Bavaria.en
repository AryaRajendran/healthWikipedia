'''Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria''' (9 August 1839 – 30 November 1909) was a member of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] and a professional [[ophthalmology|oculist]]. He was the brother of the [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth of Austria]].

==Life==
Karl-Theodor was born at [[Possenhofen Castle]], the third son of [[Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria|Duke Maximilian in Bavaria]] and of his wife, [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria]].

At the age of fourteen Karl-Theodor joined the Bavarian Army.  In 1866 he fought in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. When he left active duty, he became a student at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]], where he studied philosophy, law, economics, and medicine.  Among his teachers were the chemist [[Justus von Liebig]], the pathologist [[Ludwig von Buhl]], and the physicist [[Philipp von Jolly]].

In 1870 Karl-Theodor's studies were interrupted by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in which he served as a proprietary colonel of the 3rd Bavarian Light Horse.  After the war he returned to his studies.  In 1872 he was named an honorary Doctor of Medicine by the Ludwig Maximilians University; the following year he completed the requirements for the degree. Then he studied ophthalmology under Professor Deutschland and continued his education in [[Vienna]] and in [[Zurich]].

In 1877 Karl-Theodor began practicing medicine in [[Menton|Mentone]] on the [[French Riviera|Côte d'Azur]], often assisted by his wife Maria Josepha. In 1880 he opened an eye-clinic in his castle at [[Tegernsee Abbey|Tegernsee]]. In 1895 he founded the ''Augenklinik Herzog Carl Theodor'' ({{lang-en|Duke Charles Theodore Eye Clinic}}) in [[Munich]]; the clinic in the Nymphenburger Strasse remains one of the most respected eye clinics in Bavaria to the present day. Between 1895 and 1909 Carl Theodor personally carried out more than 5,000 cataract operations as well as treating countless other eye disorders.

==Honours==
Karl-Theodor received a number of honours:

* honorary doctor of the [[Catholic University of Leuven|University of Louvain]].

* honorary colonel of the [[5th (West Prussian) Cuirassiers "Duke Frederick Eugene of Württemberg"|5th Regiment of Prussian Dragoons]].

* honorary member of the Academy of Medical Sciences in [[Brussels]].

* knight of the [[Order of Saint Hubert]].

* knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (1862).

* knight of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]].

Karl-Theodor died at [[Kreuth]] in 1909.  He is buried in the family crypt in [[Tegernsee Abbey|Schloss Tegernsee]].
