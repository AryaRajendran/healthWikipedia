The '''anterior cerebral artery''' ('''ACA''') is one of a pair of arteries on [[Human brain|the brain]] that supplies oxygenated blood to most medial portions of the [[frontal lobe]]s and [[superior medial parietal]] lobes.  The two anterior cerebral arteries arise from the [[internal carotid artery]] and are part of the [[Circle of Willis]]. 

The left and right anterior cerebral arteries are connected by the [[anterior communicating artery]].

==Segments and branches==
The ACA is classified into 5 segments with the smaller branches from the ACA "callosal" arteries (supracallosal) considered as the '''A4''' and '''A5''' segments:<ref name=Kray>{{Citation |title=Cerebral Angiography |first= Hugo |last=Krayenbühl |first2= Mahmut Gazi |last2=Yaşargil |first3= Peter |last3=Huber |first4= George |last4=Bosse |year=1982 |publisher=Thieme |pages=79–91|isbn=978-0-86577-067-6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=0e6YO3IEbt0C&dq}}</ref>
*'''A1''': this segment originates from the internal carotid artery and extends to the ''anterior communicating artery'' (AComm). The ''anteromedial central'' (medial lenticulostriate) arteries arise from this segment as well as the AComm, which irrigate the [[caudate nucleus]] and the anterior limb of the [[internal capsule]]
*'''A2''': this segment extends from the AComm to the bifurcation forming the ''pericallosal'' and ''callosomarginal arteries''. The ''[[recurrent artery of Heubner]]'' (distal medial striate artery), which irrigate the internal capsule, usually arises at the beginning of this segment near the AComm. 4 branches arise from this segment, the:
**''Orbitofrontal artery'' (medial frontal basal): Arises first a small distance away from the AComm
**''Frontopolar artery'' (polar frontal): Arises after the ''orbitofrontal'' close to when A2 curves posteriorly over the [[corpus callosum]]. Could also originate from the ''callosal marginal''.
*'''A3''': Also termed the ''pericallosal artery'' this is one of (or the only) the main terminal branches of the ACA, which extends posteriorly in the pericallosal sulcus to form the ''internal parietal arteries'' (superior, inferior) and the ''precuneal artery''. This artery may form an [[anastomosis]] with the ''[[posterior cerebral artery]]''.
**''Callosal marginal artery'': A commonly present terminal branch of the ACA, which bifurcates from the ''pericallosal artery''. This artery in turn branches into the ''medial frontal arteries'' (Anterior, Intermediate, Posterior), and the ''paracentral artery'', with the [[cingulate]] branches arising throughout its length. Depending on [[anatomical variation]], the ''callosal marginal artery'' may be none discrete or not be visible. In the latter case, the branches mentioned will originate from the ''pericallosal artery''. In a study of 76 hemispheres, the artery was present in only 60% of the cases.<ref>{{Citation|first=MARCO A. STEFANI |last=SCHNEIDER |first2=ANTONIO C.

==Areas supplied==
Areas supplied by the anterior cerebral artery include:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

# The medial surface of the [[frontal lobe]] by the medial orbito-frontal artery, and [[parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes
# The anterior four- fifths of the [[corpus callosum]]
# Approximately 1&nbsp;inch of the medial surfaces of frontal and parietal lobes, next to the [[medial longitudinal fissure]]
# Anterior portions of the [[basal ganglia]] and [[internal capsule]]
# [[Olfactory bulb]] and tract

==Occlusion==
Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery may result in the following defects:<ref>Harrison's Priciples of Internal Medicine 18th Edition vol. 2 Chapter 370, Cerebrovascular Diseases,page 3286, Fig 370-8</ref>
If stroke occurs prior to the anterior communicating artery it is usually well tolerated secondary to collateral circulation.
Occlusion of A2 segment(Post communal segment of Anterior cerebral artery) the following signs and symptoms may be noted.
# [[Paralysis]] or weakness of the [[contralateral]] foot and leg  due to involvement of Motor leg area
# Cortical [[Sensory loss]] in the contralateral foot and leg
# [[Gait apraxia]] Impairtment of gait and stance
# [[Abulia]] akinetic mutism, slowness and lack of spontaneity
# [[Urinary incontinence]] which usually occurs with [[wiktionary:bilateral|bilateral]] damage in the acute phase
#  Frontal Cortical release reflexes: Contralateral [[grasp reflex]], [[sucking reflex]], [[gegenhalten]](paratonic rigidity)
