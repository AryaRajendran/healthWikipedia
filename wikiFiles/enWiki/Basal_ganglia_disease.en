'''Basal ganglia disease''' refers to a group of physical [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]]s that occur when the group of nuclei in the brain known as the [[basal ganglia]] fail to properly suppress unwanted movements or to properly prime upper motor [[neuron]] circuits to initiate motor function.<ref name="Purves">{{cite book |author=Purves, D., Augustine, G., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W., LaManita, A.-S., McNamara, J., ''et al.'' |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland MA |year=2008 |edition=4th }}</ref> Research indicates that increased output of the basal ganglia inhibits thalamocortical projection neurons. Proper activation or deactivation of these neurons is an integral component for proper movement.  If something causes too much basal ganglia output, then the thalamocortical projection neurons become too inhibited and one cannot initiate voluntary movement. These disorders are known as [[Hypokinesia|hypokinetic disorder]]s.  However, a disorder leading to abnormally low output of the basal ganglia leads to relatively no inhibition of the thalamocortical projection neurons. This situation leads to an inability to suppress unwanted movements.  These disorders are known as [[Hyperkinesia (muscular activity)|hyperkinetic disorder]]s.<ref name="Video">{{cite journal |author=Wichmann T, DeLong MR |title=Functional and pathophysiological models of the basal ganglia |journal=Curr.

The basal ganglia is a collective group of structures in the brain. These include the [[striatum]], (composed of the [[putamen]] and [[caudate nucleus]]), [[globus pallidus]], [[substantia nigra]], and the [[subthalamic nucleus]]. Along with other structures, the basal ganglia are part of a circuit that is integral to voluntary motor function.<ref name="Purves" /> It was once believed that the primary function of the basal ganglia was to integrate projections from the [[cerebral cortex]], and project information via the [[thalamus]] to the [[motor cortex]]. New research shows that the basal ganglia can be modeled as a group of components of parallel, reentrant cortico-subcortical circuits, which originate in cortical areas, traverse the basal ganglia and terminate in specific areas in the frontal lobe.<ref name="Circuits" />  These areas are thought to control not only motor function but also [[oculomotor]], [[prefrontal]], associative, and [[limbic system|limbic]] areas.<ref name="Video" /> Understanding these circuits has led to breakthroughs in understanding the disorders of the basal ganglia.

===Direct Pathway===
Of all the circuits, the motor circuit is the most studied due its importance to motor disorders. The direct pathway of the motor circuit is one in which projections from the cortex travel to the [[putamen]] directly to the internal segment of the [[globus pallidus]] (GPi) or the [[substantia nigra]], [[pars reticulata]] (SNr) and are then directed toward the [[ventral anterior nucleus]] (VA), and the [[ventral lateral nucleus]] of the thalamus (VL) and brainstem.<ref name="Video" /><ref name="Circuits" />
Through this pathway the basal ganglia is able to initiate voluntary movements by disinhibiting thalamic neurons that drive upper motor neurons.<ref name="Purves" /> This process is regulated by dopamine secreted by the [[striatum]] and the D<sub>1</sub> dopamine receptor on the SNc. Dopamine excites striatal neurons in the direct pathway.<ref name="Problems">{{cite journal |author=Nambu A |title=Seven problems on the basal ganglia |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=595–604 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19081243 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.11.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(08)00155-4}}</ref> Proper striatal dopamine release is integral in the suppression of the basal ganglia output, which is needed for increased activity of the thalamic neurons.<ref name="Video" />  This acitivity in thalamic nuclei is an integral component of voluntary movement.

===Indirect Pathway===

The indirect pathway of the motor circuit is thought to project from the cortex, to the putamen, and to the thalamus and brainstem indirectly by passing through the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN).<ref name="Circuits" />  The indirect pathway is responsible for the termination of movement. The indirect pathway inhibits unwanted movements by simultaneous increase in excitatory input to other GPi and SNr neurons.<ref name="Circuits" />  Similar to the direct pathway, the indirect pathway is regulated by striatal dopamine. D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors inhibit transmission via the indirect pathway.  D<sub>2</sub> receptors inhibit striatal neurons in the inhibitory pathway.<ref name="Problems" /> This inhibitory effect of dopamine on the indirect pathway serves the same function as its excitatory effects in the direct pathway in that it reduces basal ganglia output, leading to the disinhibition of motor neurons.<ref name="Video" />

==Associated Disorders==

===Hypokinetic Disorders===
Hypokinetic disorders are movement disorders that are described as having reduced motor function.  This is generally attributed to higher than normal basal ganglia output causing inhibition of thalamocortical motor neurons.

====Parkinsonism====
{{main|Parkinsonism}}
The muscle rigidity, tremor at rest, and slowness in initiation and execution of movement that are the cardinal motor symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]] are attributed to a reduction in dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia motor areas, particularly the putamen, due to gradually reduced innervation from SNc.<ref name="SteinerTseng2010">{{cite book|author1=Heinz Steiner|author2=Kuei Y. Tseng|title=Handbook of Basal Ganglia Structure and Function|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fu1SefIyEysC&pg=PA663|accessdate=20 April 2012|date=4 January 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374767-9|page=663}}</ref> Other motor deficits and common non-motor features of Parkinson's such as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and gait/balance difficulties, are thought to result from widespread progressive pathological changes commencing in the lower brain stem and ascending to the midbrain, amygdala, thalamus and ultimately the cerebral cortex.<ref name="Circuits"/>

===Hyperkinetic Disorders===
Hyperkinetic disorders are movement disorders characterized by increased uncontrollable motor function.  They are caused by reduced basal ganglia output, which causes increased thalamocortical function which lead to the inability to stop unwanted movement.

====Huntington's Disease====
{{main|Huntington's Disease}}

Huntington’s disease is a hereditary disease that causes defects in behavior, cognition, and uncontrolled rapid, jerky movements.<ref name="Purves" />  Huntington’s disease stems from a defect that consists of an expanded CAG repeat in a gene located on chromosome 4.  Evidence shows that the basal ganglias in patients with Huntington’s Disease show a decrease in activity of the mitochondrial pathway, complex II-III. Such deficiencies are often associated with basal ganglia degeneration.<ref name="Beal">{{cite journal |author=Beal MF |title=Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1366 |issue=1-2 |pages=211–23 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9714810 }}</ref> This degeneration of striatal neurons projecting to GPe leads to disinhibition of the indirect pathway, increased inhibition of STN, and therefore, reduced output of the basal ganglia.<ref name="Video" />  The neuronal degeneration eventually causes death within 10 to 20 years.

====Dystonia====
{{main|dystonia}}

Dystonia is hyperkinetic movement disorder that is characterized by involuntary movement and the slowing of intentional movement. Though there are known causes of dystonia such as metabolic, vascular, and structural abnormalities, there are still patients with dystonia with no apparent cause. Dystonia can occur as a hyperkinetic disorder or as a side effect of hypokinetic disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.<ref name="Vitek">{{cite journal |author=Vitek JL, Chockkan V, Zhang JY, ''et al.'' |title=Neuronal activity in the basal ganglia in patients with generalized dystonia and hemiballismus |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=22–35 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10401777 | doi = 10.1002/1531-8249(199907)46:1<22::AID-ANA6>3.0.CO;2-Z  }}</ref>  Until recently it was thought that dystonia was likely caused by extreme lack of function of the direct pathway between the Putamen and the GPi.  Again, it was thought that this dysfunction lead to a decrease in basal ganglia output to the thalamus and a resultant increased disinhibition of the thalamic projections to the premotor and motor cortex. .<ref name="Dystonia online">{{cite journal |author=Janavs JL, Aminoff MJ |title=Dystonia and chorea in acquired systemic disorders |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=436–45 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9771763 |pmc=2170280 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9771763 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.65.4.436}}</ref>  However recent models in mice show that the dysfunction in the cerebellum may play an equal part in dystonia. .<ref name="Dystonia Hess">{{cite journal |author=Neychev VK, Fan X, Mitev VI, Hess EJ, Jinnah HA |title=The basal ganglia and cerebellum interact in the expression of dystonic movement |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2499–509 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18669484 |pmc=2724906 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn168 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18669484}}</ref>

====Hemiballismus====
{{main|hemiballismus}}

Hemiballismus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that causes uncontrolled movement on one side of the body.  It is generally caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus (STN).  Since the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is the link in the circuit between the STN and thalamic projection, destruction of localized brain cells in the GPi via a pallidotony has proven to serve as a useful treatment for Hemiballismus.<ref name="Vitek" />

===Non-Motor Disorders===

====Tourette Syndrome/Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder====
{{main|Tourette syndrome}}
{{main|Obsessive-compulsive disorder}}

Tourette syndrome is a disorder that is characterized by behavioral and motor tics, OCD, and [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] ([[ADHD]]).  For this reason, it is commonly believed that pathologies involving limbic, associative, and motor circuits of the basal ganglia are likely. Since the realization that syndromes such as Tourette Syndrome and OCD are caused by dysfunction of the non-motor loops of basal ganglia circuits, new treatments for these disorders, based on treatments originally designed to treat movement disorders are being developed.<ref name="Circuits" />

==Therapeutic Research==

===Gene Therapy===
{{main|gene therapy}}

Many disorders of the basal ganglia are due to the dysfunction of a localized area.  For this reason gene therapy seems viable for neurodegenerative disorders. Gene therapy is performed by replacing diseased phenotypes with new genetic material.  This process is still in the early stages but early results are promising. An example of this therapy might involve implanting cells genetically modified to express tyrosine hydroxylase which, in the body, could be converted to dopamine.  Increasing dopamine levels in the basal ganglia could possibly offset the effects of the Parkinson’s Disease.<ref name="Purves" />

===Lesioning/ablation===
{{main|ablation}}

Lesionsing is a term that signifies the destruction of neuronal cells in a particular area.  Though this seems dangerous, vast improvements have been achieved in patients with movement disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baron MS, Vitek JL, Bakay RA, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease by posterior GPi pallidotomy: 1-year results of a pilot study |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=355–66 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8797525 |doi=10.1002/ana.410400305 }}</ref>  The exact process generally involves unilateral lesioning in the sensorimotor territory of the GPi. This process is called [[pallidotomy]]. It is believed that the success of pallidotomies in reducing the effects of movement disorders may result from the interruption of abnormal neuronal activity in the GPi.  This ablation technique can be viewed as simply removing a faulty piece of a circuit. With the damaged piece of the circuit removed, the healthy area of the circuit can continue normal function.<ref name="Vitek" />

===Deep Brain Stimulation===
{{main|Deep brain stimulation}}

Deep brain stimulation involves inserting, via [[Stereotactic surgery|stereotaxic surgery]], electrodes into the sensorimotor area of the brain.<ref name="Purves" /><ref name="Circuits" /> 
These electrodes emit high-frequency stimulation to the implanted areas.<ref name="Circuits" /> 
Bilateral implantation is necessary for symmetric results as well as the ability to reduce the intensity and duration of off-periods as well increase the duration of on-periods.<ref name="Purves" /><ref name="Circuits" /> The most effective structures used for implantations for deep brain stimulation are the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalmic nucleus (STN).  This is because it is safer and more effective to alter the influence of the basal ganglia on the thalamocortical nuclei than directly altering neural activity in [[upper motor neuron]] circuits.<ref name="Purves" /> Deep brain stimulation is a more complicated process than other therapies such as ablation. Evidence suggests that benefits of STN deep brain stimulation is due to the activation of efferents and the modulation of discharge patterns in the GPi that are propagated throughout the thalamocorical pathways.<ref name="Circuits" />  The ability to adjust stimulation protocols lends this treatment to a variety of disorders do its ability to alter the activity of basal ganglia circuits.<ref name="Purves" />
