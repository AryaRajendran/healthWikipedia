'''Stafford Leak Warren''' (July 19, 1896 - July 26, 1981) was an American [[physician]] and [[radiologist]] who was a pioneer in the field of [[nuclear medicine]] and best known for his invention of the [[mammogram]]. Warren developed the technique of producing [[stereoscopic]] images of the breast with X-rays while working in the Department of [[Radiology]] at the [[University of Rochester School of Medicine]].

Warren was commissioned as a colonel in the [[United States Army Medical Corps]] in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the [[Manhattan Engineering District]]. He was responsible for the health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]] where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first [[nuclear weapon]]. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for [[Operation Crossroads]], the [[nuclear test]] at [[Bikini Atoll]].

In 1947 Warren became the first dean of the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|School of Medicine]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President [[John F. Kennedy]] and later [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on [[mental retardation]]. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became [[professor emeritus]], a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] for his contributions to science and medicine.

==Early life==
Stafford Leak Warren was born in [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] on June 19, 1896. He attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1918. He married Viola Lockhart on May 22, 1920. Their marriage produced two daughters and a son. He went to medical school at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], graduating with his [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree in 1922. He then did post-doctoral work at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] and [[Harvard University]].<ref name="obit">{{cite web |url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00170&toc.depth=1&toc.id= |title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1985 |publisher= [[University of California]] |accessdate=March 12, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1930, Warren became an Associate Professor of Medicine.<ref name="obit"/> That year he published "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=S.L. |title=A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast |journal=The American Journal of Roentgenology and Radium Therapy |volume=24 |year=1930 |pages=113–124 }}</ref> X-ray imaging of the breast had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 [[mastectomy]] specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer.

==Manhattan Project==
In February 1943, Warren met with Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]] and [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[James C. Marshall]], the commander of the [[Manhattan Engineer District]] (MED). They asked him about his work with radiation and [[isotopes]] and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1966|pp=848–849}}</ref> In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's [[New York City]] headquarters. Friedell had joined the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to provide all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.<ref>{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=122}}</ref>

[[File:Survey Team Nagasaki.jpg|300px|thumb|left| Survey team from the Manhattan Project in Nagasaki, October 1945. Colonel Warren is holding a doll and case given to the team by the Japanese medical commandant of the unit.|alt=A group of men in uniforms stand in front of a wooden building. One, holding a box, is very tall, towering over the Asian man next to him.]]
Friedell recommended that in view of the scope of the Manhattan Project, a more senior officer be placed in charge. In October, Groves penned a letter to the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]], [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Norman T. Kirk]], requesting that he cooperate with the Manhattan Project in furnishing medical supplies, providing funds for medical care of military personnel, and directly commissioning Warren and other doctors at specified ranks. This letter was signed by [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Brehon B. Somervell]] and delivered in person by Colonel [[Kenneth D. Nichols]], who had replaced Marshall as the district engineer. Kirk was furious at what he saw as usurpation of his statutory responsibilities as Surgeon General. When told that Warren was the man the district had in mind to commission as a colonel, and apparently familiar with Warren's work only from his use of radiation to treat [[venereal disease]] asked "Why do you want that clap doctor?"<ref name="Nichols, p. 123">{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=123}}</ref>

Warren was duly commissioned as a colonel in the [[United States Army Medical Corps]] on November 3, 1943. He was appointed as chief of the MED's medical section and medical advisor to the director of the Manhattan Project, with Friedell as his deputy. Warren's office was initially located in New York City but moved to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] soon after. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, [[Richland, Washington]] and [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].<ref name="Nichols, p. 123"/> Warren's section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using  hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages used in novel ways, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=410}}</ref> Yet in December 1945, the [[National Safety Council]] presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below that of private industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=430}}</ref>

Warren was personally responsible for the safety aspects of the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] on 16 July 1945 at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of [[geiger counter]]s was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had [[US Navy]] [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=298–299}}</ref>

[[File:Operation Crossroads - Able 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|250px|alt=Aerial view of the mushroom cloud.|Aerial view of the ''Able'' mushroom cloud rising from the lagoon with Bikini Island visible in the background. The cloud carried the radioactive contaminants into the stratosphere.]]
The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] were carried out on 6 and 9  August 1945. On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren  and ordered him to organize a survey team and proceed to [[Guam]], and thence to Japan to evaluate the effect of the atomic bombs and take measures to insure the safety of Allied troops occupying the cities. Initially the survey team was to accompany the assault troops of the [[III Amphibious Corps]] and the [[V Amphibious Corps]] in the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]], but Japan surrendered on 14 August, the day the survey team departed San Francisco by air. The survey team arrived on Tinian on 17 August, where it was split into two parties, one under Warren and the other under Friedell. Warren's  party, equipped with portable geiger counters, arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group headed by [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas F. Farrell]] that also included Brigadier General [[James B. Newman Jr]] and Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. They were impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs and the extensive Japanese preparations for an American invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1966|pp=886–889}}</ref>

The detonation of the two atomic bombs in Japan "raised as many military and medicomilitary questions as they answered".<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1966|p=901}}</ref> A series of nuclear tests was planned, codenamed [[Operation Crossroads]]. Some 42,000 personnel were deployed to [[Bikini Atoll]] as part of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William H. P. Blandy]]'s Joint Task Force 1 to conduct the test. Their health and safety was Lyons's responsibility, but the specialised job of radiological safety was handled by the Manhattan Project. Warren, as Chief of the Radiological Safety Section (RADSAFE), planned and implemented measures to assess, limit and control the impact of radiation. Teams were given special training at Oak Ridge in the operation of instrumentation to measure radioactivity, and the interpretation of their readings.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=384–385}}</ref> Training was also conducted aboard {{USS|Haven|AH-12|6}} en route to [[Bikini Atoll]], where it arrived on 12 June 1946.  In all, some 3,500 personnel were assigned to RADSAFE.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1966|pp=902–905}}</ref> Warren was appalled by the effects of radioactive contamination on the environment. "The deadly range of radioactive products from the atomic bomb has been clearly demonstrated under controlled conditions..." he wrote, "the only defense against atomic bombs still lies outside the scope of science. It is the prevention of atomic war."<ref>{{cite journal

Warren left the Army on 6 November 1946. He temporarily became the Chief of the Medical Section of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], the civilian agency which succeeded the Manhattan Project. In February 1947, he was replaced by Dr [[Shields Warren]].<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1966|p=915}}</ref> For his services with the Manhattan Engineer District. Warren was awarded the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]]<ref name="papers"/> and the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref name="obit"/>

==University of California==
Toward the end of World War II, a group of physicians proposed that the University of California should establish a medical school in Southern California. One of them was the [[urologist]] [[Elmer Belt]], whose patients included the [[Governor of California]], [[Earl Warren]]. The University of California Board of Regents voted to establish a medical school as part of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) on October 19, 1945. In 1946 the [[California State Legislature]] unanimously voted $7 million to establish the new school, and Earl Warren signed it into law.<ref name="UCLA">{{cite web |url=http://dgsom.healthsciences.ucla.edu/dgsom/pages/about |title=About the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA |publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]] |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref>

In 1947, Warren was appointed the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|new school]]'s first dean. Once again he found himself involved in creating a new medical school.<ref name="California Medicine"/> His first appointments were three former associates in Rochester: Dr [[Charles Carpenter (medical researcher)|Charles Carpenter]] as the first professor of infectious disease; Dr [[Andrew H. Dowdy]] as the first professor of radiology; and  Dr [[John H. Lawrence]], who had pioneered the use of [[phosphorus-32]] as a radioactive tracer, as professor of medicine.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1966|pp=834–836}}</ref><ref name="UCLA"/> With Dr [[William P. Longmire Jr]], a 34-year old plastic surgeon from Johns Hopkins University recruited by Lawrence as professor of surgery,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://williamlongmire.org/biography.htm |title=William P. Longmire, Jr. |publisher=williamlongmire.org |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> they became the "Founding Five" of the new school. Initially, the new school was accommodated in wartime [[Quonset hut]]s scattered about the UCLA campus.<ref name="UCLA"/> Warren was still wearing his army fatigues.<ref name="obit"/> Construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949. By 1951 when the first students, 26 men and two women, arrived there were 15 faculty members. By the time the first class graduated in 1955 there were 43  faculty members. The [[UCLA Medical Center]] opened in 1955.<ref name="UCLA"/>

Under Warren's leadership, the school grew steadily, adding Schools of Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. Against some influential opposition, Warren established his medical school on the UCLA campus rather than in another part of the city. He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university. He fostered the development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences.<ref name="obit"/>

Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President [[John F. Kennedy]] and later [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on [[mental retardation]]. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became [[professor emeritus]], a position he held until his death in 1981.<ref name="papers"/> His first wife Viola died in 1963 and on July 18, 1970 he married Gertrude Turner Hubberty.<ref name="obit"/> In 1971, Warren was awarded the [[Enrico Fermi Award]]. His citation read:
{{quote|For the imaginative, prescient, and vigorous efforts which made possible the early development of atomic energy so as to assure the protection of man and the environment, and for the establishment of a biomedical research program which has resulted in many substantial applications of ionizing radiation to diagnosis and treatment of disease and to the general welfare.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enrico Fermi Award - Stafford L.
