'''Passive smoking''' is the inhalation of smoke, called '''second-hand smoke''' ('''SHS'''), or '''environmental tobacco smoke''' ('''ETS'''), by persons other than the intended "active" smoker. It occurs when tobacco smoke permeates any environment, causing its inhalation by people within that environment.

Concerns around second-hand smoke have played a central role in the debate over the harms and regulation of tobacco products. Since the early 1970s, the [[tobacco industry]] has viewed public concern over second-hand smoke as a serious threat to its business interests.<ref name="smoke-screen">{{cite web |url = http://dev.ersnet.org/uploads/Document/ab/WEB_CHEMIN_1092_1166196139.pdf |title = Lifting the smokescreen: Tobacco industry strategy to defeat smoke free policies and legislation |publisher = European Respiratory Society and Institut National du Cancer |author = Diethelm P, McKee M |quote = The industry quickly realised that, if it wanted to continue to prosper, it became vital that research did not demonstrate that tobacco smoke was a dangerous community air pollutant.

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] studies show that non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke are at risk for many of the health problems associated with direct smoking.

In 1992, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' published a review of available evidence on the relationship between second-hand smoke and heart disease, and estimated that second-hand smoke exposure was responsible for 35,000 to 40,000 deaths per year in the [[United States]] in the early 1980s.<ref name="steenland">{{cite journal |author=Steenland K |title=Passive smoking and the risk of heart disease |journal=JAMA |volume=267 |issue=1 |pages=94–9 |year=1992 |month=January |pmid=1727204 |doi= 10.1001/jama.267.1.94|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/267/1/94 }}</ref> The [[absolute risk increase]] of heart disease due to ETS was 2.2%, while the [[attributable risk percent]] was 23%.

Research using more exact measures of second-hand smoke exposure suggests that risks to non-smokers may be even greater than this estimate. A British study reported that exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of heart disease among non-smokers by as much as 60%, similar to light smoking.<ref name="pmid15229131">{{cite journal |author=Whincup PH, Gilg JA, Emberson JR, ''et al.'' |title=Passive smoking and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke: prospective study with cotinine measurement |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7459 |pages=200–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15229131 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38146.427188.55 |pmc=487731 }}</ref> Evidence also shows that inhaled sidestream smoke, the main component of second-hand smoke, is about four times more toxic than mainstream smoke.

In 2004, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reviewed all significant published evidence related to tobacco smoking and cancer. It concluded:

The National Asthma Council of Australia cites studies showing that second-hand smoke is probably the most important indoor pollutant, especially around young children:<ref>{{cite web |title=Health effects of indoor air pollution |url=http://www.nationalasthma.org.au/html/management/infopapers/health_professionals/4005.asp |accessdate=2006-07-26 }}</ref>
* Smoking by either parent, particularly by the mother, increases the risk of asthma in children.
* The outlook for early childhood asthma is less favourable in smoking households.
* Children with asthma who are exposed to smoking in the home generally have more severe disease.
* Many adults with asthma identify ETS as a trigger for their symptoms.
* Doctor-diagnosed asthma is more common among non-smoking adults exposed to ETS than those not exposed. Among people with asthma, higher ETS exposure is associated with a greater risk of severe attacks.

=== Risk level ===
<span class="wikiEditor-tab"></span>
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] concluded in 2004 that there was sufficient evidence that second-hand smoke caused cancer in humans.<ref name=IARC2004/>
<span class="wikiEditor-tab"></span>
Most experts conclude that moderate, occasional exposure to second-hand smoke presents a modest but measurable cancer risk to nonsmokers. The overall risk depends on the effective dose received over time. The risk level is higher if non-smokers spend many hours in an environment where cigarette smoke is widespread, such as a business where many employees or patrons are smoking throughout the day, or a residential care facility where residents smoke freely.<ref name="environmental1440">{{cite journal |author=Boffetta P, Agudo A, Ahrens W, ''et al.'' |title=Multicenter case-control study of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in Europe |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=90 |issue=19 |pages=1440–50 |year=1998 |pmid=9776409|doi=10.1093/jnci/90.19.1440 }}</ref>
<span class="wikiEditor-tab"></span>
The [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]], in his 2006 report, estimated that living or working in a place where smoking is permitted increases the non-smokers' risk of developing heart disease by 25–30% and lung cancer by 20–30%.

===Biomarkers===
[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin displayed below.]]
Environmental tobacco smoke can be evaluated either by directly measuring tobacco smoke pollutants found in the air or by using biomarkers, an indirect measure of exposure. [[Carbon monoxide breath monitor|Carbon monoxide]] monitored through breath, [[nicotine]], [[cotinine]], [[thiocyanates]], and proteins are the most specific biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure.<ref name=Metz05>{{cite journal |author=Metz-Favre C, Donnay C, de Blay F |title=[Markers of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure] |language=French |journal=Rev Mal Respir |volume=22 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=81–92 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15968761 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McClure JB |title=Are biomarkers useful treatment aids for promoting health behavior change?

Certain groups of people are reluctant to disclose their smoking status and exposure to tobacco smoke, especially pregnant women and parents of young children. This is due to their smoking being socially unacceptable. Also, it may be difficult for individuals to recall their exposure to tobacco smoke.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klesges RC, Debon M, Ray JW |title=Are self-reports of smoking rate biased?

A 2007 study in the Addictive Behaviors Journal found a positive correlation between second-hand tobacco smoke exposure and concentrations of nicotine and/or biomarkers of nicotine in the body. Significant biological levels of nicotine from second-hand smoke exposure were equivalent to nicotine levels from active smoking and levels that are associated with behaviour changes due to nicotine consumption.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Okoli CT, Kelly T, Hahn EJ |title=Secondhand smoke and nicotine exposure: a brief review |journal=Addict Behav |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=1977–88 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17270359 |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2006.12.024 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-4603(07)00002-0}}</ref>

====Cotinine====
[[Cotinine]], the metabolite of nicotine, is a biomarker of second-hand smoke exposure. Typically, cotinine is measured in the blood, saliva, and urine. Hair analysis has recently become a new, noninvasive measurement technique. Cotinine accumulates in hair during hair growth, which results in a measure of long-term, cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke.<ref name=Florescu09>{{cite journal |author=Florescu A, Ferrence R, Einarson T, Selby P, Soldin O, Koren G |title=Methods for quantification of exposure to cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke: focus on developmental toxicology |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=14–30 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19125149 |doi=10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181957a3b |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0163-4356&volume=31&issue=1&spage=14}}</ref>  Urinary cotinine levels have been a reliable biomarker of tobacco exposure and have been used as a reference in many epidemiological studies. However, cotinine levels found in the urine only reflect exposure over the preceding 48 hours. Cotinine levels of the skin, such as the hair and nails, reflect tobacco exposure over the previous three months and are a more reliable biomarker.<ref name=Metz05/>

====Carbon monoxide (CO)====
[[Carbon monoxide breath monitor|Carbon monoxide monitored via breath]] is also a reliable biomarker of second-hand smoke exposure as well as tobacco use.  With high sensitivity and specificity, it not only provides an accurate measure, but the test is also non-invasive, highly reproducible, and low in cost.  Breath CO monitoring measures the concentration of CO in an exhalation in [[parts per million]], and this can be directly correlated to the blood CO concentration ([[carboxyhemoglobin]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Irving JM, Clark EC, Crombie IK, Smith WC |title=Evaluation of a portable measure of expired-air carbon monoxide |journal=Prev Med |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=109–15 |year=1988 |month=January |pmid=3362796 |doi=10.1016/0091-7435(88)90076-X }}</ref> Breath CO monitors can also be used by emergency services to identify patients who are suspected of having CO poisoning.

== Pathophysiology ==
A 2004 study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens as active smokers. [[Sidestream smoke]] contains more than 4,000 chemicals, including 69 known carcinogens. Of special concern are [[polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]], tobacco-specific N-[[nitrosamines]], and [[aromatic amines]], such as [[4-aminobiphenyl]], all known to be highly carcinogenic.  Mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke, and second-hand smoke contain largely the same components, however the concentration varies depending on type of smoke.<ref name=IARC2004/>  Several well-established [[carcinogen]]s have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schick S, Glantz S. |title=Philip Morris toxicological experiments with fresh sidestream smoke: more toxic than mainstream smoke |journal=Tob Control. |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=396–404 |year=2005 |pmid=16319363 |pmc=1748121 |doi=10.1136/tc.2005.011288 }}</ref>

Second-hand smoke has been shown to produce more particulate-matter (PM) pollution than an idling low-emission [[diesel engine]]. In an experiment conducted by the Italian National Cancer Institute, three cigarettes were left [[smolder]]ing, one after the other, in a 60&nbsp;m³ garage with a limited air exchange. The cigarettes produced PM pollution exceeding outdoor limits, as well as PM concentrations up to 10-fold that of the idling engine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Invernizzi G, Ruprecht A, Mazza R, ''et al.'' |title=Particulate matter from tobacco versus diesel car exhaust: an educational perspective |journal=Tob Control |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15333875 |pmc=1747905 |doi=10.1136/tc.2003.005975 }}</ref>

though the magnitude of risk, if any, remains unknown. In October 2011, it was reported that Christus St. Frances Cabrini Hospital in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]] would seek to eliminate third-hand smoke beginning in July 2012, and that employees whose clothing smelled of smoke would not be allowed to work. This prohibition was enacted because third-hand smoke poses a special danger for the developing brains of infants and small children.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/03/louisiana-hospital-to-ban-odor-smoke-on-workers-clothes/?test=latestnews Louisiana Hospital to Ban Odor of Smoke on Workers' Clothes], Fox News, October 3, 2011</ref>

In 2008, there were more than 161,000 deaths attributed to lung cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, an estimated 10% to 15% were caused by factors other than first-hand smoking; equivalent to 16,000 to 24,000 deaths annually. Slightly more than half of the lung cancer deaths caused by factors other than first-hand smoking were found in nonsmokers. Lung cancer in non-smokers may well be considered one of the most common cancer mortalities in the United States. Clinical epidemiology of lung cancer has linked the primary factors closely tied to lung cancer in non-smokers as exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, carcinogens including radon, and other indoor air pollutants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samet JM, Avila-Tang E, Boffetta P, ''et al.'' |title=LUNG CANCER IN NEVER SMOKERS: CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS |journal=Clin.

== Public opinion ==
Recent major surveys conducted by the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]] have found widespread public awareness that second-hand smoke is harmful. In both 1992 and 2000 surveys, more than 80% of respondents agreed with the statement that second-hand smoke was harmful. A 2001 study found that 95% of adults agreed that second-hand smoke was harmful to children, and 96% considered tobacco-industry claims that second-hand smoke was not harmful to be untruthful.<ref>{{harvnb|Surgeon General|2006|p=588 Ch. 10}}</ref>

A 2007 [[Gallup poll]] found that 56% of respondents felt that second-hand smoke was "very harmful", a number that has held relatively steady since 1997. Another 29% believe that second-hand smoke is "somewhat harmful"; 10% answered "not too harmful", while 5% said "not at all harmful".

As part of its attempt to prevent or delay tighter regulation of smoking, the tobacco industry funded a number of scientific studies and, where the results cast doubt on the risks associated with second-hand smoke, sought wide publicity for those results. The industry also funded libertarian and conservative think tanks, such as the [[Cato Institute]] in the United States and the [[Institute of Public Affairs]] in Australia which criticised both scientific research on passive smoking and policy proposals to restrict smoking.<ref>"[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cato_Institute#Cato_and_the_tobacco_industry Cato and the tobacco industry]".

===Industry-funded studies and critiques===
====Enstrom and Kabat====
A 2003 study by Enstrom and Kabat, published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', argued that the harms of passive smoking had been overstated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Enstrom JE, Kabat GC |title=Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality in a prospective study of Californians, 1960-98 |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7398 |page=1057 |year=2003 |pmid=12750205 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7398.1057 |pmc=155687 }}</ref> Their analysis reported no statistically significant relationship between passive smoking and lung cancer, though the accompanying editorial noted that "they may overemphasise the negative nature of their findings."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davey Smith G |title=Effect of passive smoking on health: More information is available, but the controversy still persists |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7398 |pages=1048–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12750182 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7398.1048 |pmc=1125974 }}</ref> This paper was widely promoted by the tobacco industry as evidence that the harms of passive smoking were unproven.<ref>{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|p=1383}}</ref><ref name="tong2007">{{cite journal |author=Tong EK, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts undermining evidence linking secondhand smoke with cardiovascular disease |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=16 |pages=1845–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17938301 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.715888 }}</ref> The [[American Cancer Society]] (ACS), whose database Enstrom and Kabat used to compile their data, criticized the paper as "neither reliable nor independent", stating that scientists at the ACS had repeatedly pointed out serious flaws in Enstrom and Kabat's methodology prior to publication.<ref name="acsresponse">{{cite press release |url = http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/BMJrelease.pdf |title = American Cancer Society Condemns Tobacco Industry Study for Inaccurate Use of Data |publisher = [[American Cancer Society]] |date = 2003-05-13 |accessdate = 2007-08-29}}</ref> Notably, the study had failed to identify a comparison group of "unexposed" persons.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7418/E237 |author=Thun MJC |title=More misleading science from the tobacco industry |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |page=E237–8 |year=2003 |doi=10.1136/bmjusa.03070002 |doi_brokendate=2010-06-20 |issue=7418}}</ref>

Enstrom's ties to the tobacco industry also drew scrutiny; in a 1997 letter to [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], Enstrom requested a "substantial research commitment... in order for me to effectively compete against the large mountain of epidemiologic data and opinions that already exist regarding the health effects of ETS and active smoking."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/dfk37d00 |title = Proposed Research on the relationship of Low Levels of Active Smoking to Mortality: Letter from James Enstrom to Philip Morris Scientific Affairs office |date = 1997-01-01 |accessdate = 2007-08-29}}</ref> In a [[Passive smoking#US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies|US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies]], the Enstrom and Kabat paper was cited by the US District Court as "a prime example of how nine tobacco companies engaged in criminal racketeering and fraud to hide the dangers of tobacco smoke."<ref name="nature-2007-review">{{cite journal |author=Dalton R |title=Passive-smoking study faces review |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7133 |pages=242 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17361147 |doi=10.1038/446242a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7133/full/446242a.html }}</ref> The Court found that the study had been funded and managed by the Center for Indoor Air Research,<ref>{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|p=1380}}</ref> a tobacco industry [[front group]] tasked with "offsetting" damaging studies on passive smoking, as well as by Phillip Morris<ref name="ong-glantz-2000"/> who stated that Enstrom's work was "clearly litigation-oriented."<ref>{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|pp=1380–3}}</ref> Enstrom has defended the accuracy of his study against what he terms "illegitimate criticism by those who have attempted to suppress and discredit it."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Enstrom JE |title=Defending legitimate epidemiologic research: combating Lysenko pseudoscience |journal=Epidemiol Perspect Innov|volume=4 |issue=1 |page=11 |year=2007 |pmid=17927827 |doi=10.1186/1742-5573-4-11 |pmc=2164936 }}</ref>

====Milloy====
[[Steven Milloy]], the "[[junk science]]" commentator for [[Fox News]] and a former [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] consultant,<ref>[https://ssl.tnr.com/p/docsub.mhtml?i=20060206&s=thacker020606 Smoked Out: Pundit for Hire], by Paul D.

Another component of criticism cited by Milloy focused on [[relative risk]] and epidemiological practices in studies of passive smoking. Milloy, who has a masters degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, argued that studies yielding relative risks of less than 2 were meaningless junk science. This approach to epidemiological analysis was criticized in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'':

{{quote|A major component of the industry attack was the mounting of a campaign to establish a "bar" for "sound science" that could not be fully met by most individual investigations, leaving studies that did not meet the criteria to be dismissed as "junk science."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samet JM, Burke TA |title=Turning Science Into Junk: The Tobacco Industry and Passive Smoking |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1742–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11684591 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1742 |pmc=1446866 }}</ref>}}

The tobacco industry and affiliated scientists also put forward a set of "Good Epidemiology Practices" which would have the practical effect of obscuring the link between secondhand smoke and lung cancer; the privately stated goal of these standards was to "impede adverse legislation".<ref>[http://www.pmdocs.com/PDF/2029059645_9652_0.PDF Scientific Communications Through the Media], from the Philip Morris document archive.

==== World Health Organization controversy ====
A 1998 report by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) found "weak evidence of a dose-response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS."<ref name="environmental1440"/>

In March 1998, before the study was published, reports appeared in the media alleging that the IARC and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) were suppressing information. The reports, appearing in the British ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Passive Smoking Doesn't Cause Cancer —Official |url=http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2063594041-4042.html}}</ref> and ''[[The Economist]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Smokescreens – The World Health Organization is showing signs of allowing politics to get in the way of truth.

[[The Times]] 1998, March 9.</ref> alleged that the WHO withheld from publication of its own report that supposedly failed to prove an association between passive smoking and a number of other diseases (lung cancer in particular).

In response, the WHO issued a press release stating that the results of the study had been "completely misrepresented" in the popular press and were in fact very much in line with similar studies demonstrating the harms of passive smoking.<ref>{{cite web |title=Passive Smoking Does Cause Lung Cancer, Do Not Let Them Fool You |url=http://www.who.int/inf-pr-1998/en/pr98-29.html}}</ref> The study was published in the ''Journal of the National Cancer Institute'' in October of the same year, and concluded the authors found "no association between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk" but "did find weak evidence of a dose–response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS."<ref name="environmental1440"/>  An accompanying editorial summarized:

{{quote|When all the evidence, including the important new data reported in this issue of the Journal, is assessed, the inescapable scientific conclusion is that ETS is a low-level lung carcinogen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blot WJ, McLaughlin JK |title=Passive smoking and lung cancer risk: what is the story now? |journal=J.

With the release of formerly classified tobacco industry documents through the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], it was found that the controversy over the WHO's alleged suppression of data had been engineered by [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], [[British American Tobacco]], and other tobacco companies in an effort to discredit scientific findings which would harm their business interests.<ref name="ong-glantz-2000">{{cite journal |author=Ong EK, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts subverting International Agency for Research on Cancer's second-hand smoke study |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9211 |pages=1253–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10770318 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02098-5 }}</ref> A WHO inquiry, conducted after the release of the tobacco-industry documents, found that this controversy was generated by the tobacco industry as part of its larger campaign to cut the WHO's budget, distort the results of scientific studies on passive smoking, and discredit the WHO as an institution.

==== EPA lawsuit ====
In 1993, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued a report estimating that 3,000 lung cancer related deaths in the [[United States]] were caused by passive smoking annually.<ref name="EPA report"/>

[[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], and groups representing growers, distributors and marketers of tobacco took legal action, claiming that the EPA had manipulated this study and ignored accepted scientific and statistical practices.

The [[United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina]] ruled in favor of the tobacco industry in 1998, finding that the EPA had failed to follow proper scientific and epidemiologic practices and had "cherry picked" evidence to support conclusions which they had committed to in advance.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Osteen Decision |url=http://www.tobacco.org/Documents/980717osteen.html}}</ref> The court stated in part, "EPA publicly committed to a conclusion before research had begun…adjusted established procedure and scientific norms to validate the Agency's public conclusion... In conducting the ETS Risk Assessment, disregarded information and made findings on selective information; did not disseminate significant epidemiologic information; deviated from its Risk Assessment Guidelines; failed to disclose important findings and reasoning…"

In 2002, the EPA successfully appealed this decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. The EPA's appeal was upheld on the preliminary grounds that their report had no regulatory weight, and the earlier finding was vacated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative vs. EPA |url=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/982407.P.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>

In 1998, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the publication by its National Toxicology Program of the 9th Report on Carcinogens, listed environmental tobacco smoke among the known carcinogens, observing of the EPA assessment that "The individual studies were carefully summarized and evaluated."<ref>{{cite book |contribution=Final Report on Carcinogens – Background Document for Environmental Tobacco Smoke |title=Meeting of the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors – Report on Carcinogens Subcommittee |editor=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Toxicology Program |location=Research Triangle Park, North Carolina |date=December 2–3, 1998 |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/files/EnvironmentalTS.pdf |page=24 |format=PDF |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref>

==== Tobacco-industry funding of research ====
The tobacco industry's role in funding scientific research on second-hand smoke has been controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thun MJ |title=Passive smoking: Tobacco industry publishes disinformation |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7413 |pages=502–3; author reply 504–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12946979 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7413.502-c |pmc=188400 }}</ref> A review of published studies found that tobacco-industry affiliation was strongly correlated with findings exonerating second-hand smoke; researchers affiliated with the tobacco industry were 88 times more likely than independent researchers to conclude that second-hand was not harmful.<ref name="pmid9605902">{{cite journal |author=Barnes DE, Bero LA |title=Why review articles on the health effects of passive smoking reach different conclusions |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=19 |pages=1566–70 |year=1998 |pmid=9605902|doi=10.1001/jama.279.19.1566 }}</ref> In a specific example which came to light with the release of tobacco-industry documents, Philip Morris executives successfully encouraged an author to revise his industry-funded review article to downplay the role of second-hand smoke in [[sudden infant death syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tong EK, England L, Glantz SA |title=Changing conclusions on secondhand smoke in a sudden infant death syndrome review funded by the tobacco industry |journal=Pediatrics |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=e356–66 |year=2005 |pmid=15741361 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1922 }}</ref> The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report criticized the tobacco industry's role in the scientific debate:

{{quote|The industry has funded or carried out research that has been judged to be biased, supported scientists to generate letters to editors that criticized research publications, attempted to undermine the findings of key studies, assisted in establishing a scientific society with a journal, and attempted to sustain controversy even as the scientific community reached consensus.<ref>{{cite web |title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke |publisher = [[Surgeon General of the United States]] |work = Executive Summary |year = 2006 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |url = http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/executivesummary.pdf |format = PDF |page=21}}</ref>}}

This strategy was outlined at an international meeting of tobacco companies in 1988, at which Philip Morris proposed to set up a team of scientists, organized by company lawyers, to "carry out work on ETS to keep the controversy alive."<ref name="whitecoat">{{cite web |url = http://tobaccodocuments.org/landman/2063791182-1187.html |title = Minutes of a meeting of Philip Morris with British tobacco companies to discuss tobacco-industry strategy on passive smoking |accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref> All scientific research was subject to oversight and "filtering" by tobacco-industry lawyers:

{{quote
|Philip Morris then expect the group of scientists to operate within the confines of decisions taken by PM scientists to determine the general direction of research, which apparently would then be 'filtered' by lawyers to eliminate areas of sensitivity.<ref name="whitecoat"/>
}}

Philip Morris reported that it was putting "...vast amounts of funding into these projects... in attempting to coordinate and pay so many scientists on an international basis to keep the ETS controversy alive."<ref name="whitecoat"/>

===Tobacco industry response===
Measures to tackle second-hand smoke pose a serious economic threat to the tobacco industry, having broadened the definition of smoking beyond a personal habit to something with a social impact. In a confidential 1978 report, the tobacco industry described increasing public concerns about second-hand smoke as "the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco industry that has yet occurred."<ref>[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/qra99d00 A Study of Public Attitudes toward Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry in 1978], produced for the Tobacco Institute and released under the terms of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]].</ref> In ''United States of America v. Philip Morris et al.'', the District Court for the District of Columbia found that the tobacco industry "... recognized from the mid-1970s forward that the health effects of passive smoking posed a profound threat to industry viability and cigarette profits," and that the industry responded with "efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that ETS causes disease."<ref name="kessler"/>

Accordingly, the tobacco industry have developed several strategies to minimise the impact on their business:
* The industry has sought to position the second-hand smoke debate as essentially concerned with civil liberties and smokers' [[Civil Rights|rights]] rather than with health, by funding groups such as [[FOREST]].<ref name="voice-smoker">{{cite journal |author=Smith EA, Malone RE |title='We will speak as the smoker': the tobacco industry's smokers' rights groups |journal=Eur J Public Health |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=306–13 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17065174 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckl244 |url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/3/306 |pmc=2794244 }}</ref>
* Funding bias in research;<ref name="smoke-screen"/> in all reviews of the effects of second-hand smoke on health published between 1980 and 1995, the only factor associated with concluding that second-hand smoke is not harmful was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry.<ref name="pmid9605902"/>  However, not all studies that failed to find evidence of harm were by industry-affiliated authors.
* Delaying and discrediting legitimate research (see<ref name="smoke-screen"/> for an example of how the industry attempted to discredit Hirayama's landmark study, and<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trotter L, Chapman S |title="Conclusions about exposure to ETS and health that will be unhelpful to us"*: How the tobacco industry attempted to delay and discredit the 1997 Australian National Health and Medical Research Council report on passive smoking |journal=Tob Control |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 3:iii |pages=102–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14645955 |doi=10.1136/tc.12.suppl_3.iii102 |pmc=1766130 }}</ref> for an example of how it attempted to delay and discredit a major Australian report on passive smoking)
* Promoting "good epidemiology" and attacking so-called [[junk science]] (a term popularised by industry lobbyist [[Steven Milloy]]): attacking the methodology behind research showing health risks as flawed and attempting to promote [[sound science]] [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A13994-2004Feb27&notFound=true]. Ong & Glantz (2001) cite an internal Phillip Morris memo giving evidence of this as company policy<ref name="pmid11684593"/>
* Creation of outlets for favourable research. In 1989, the tobacco industry established the International Society of the Built Environment, which published the [[peer-reviewed]] journal ''Indoor and Built Environment''. This journal did not require conflict-of-interest disclosures from its authors. With documents made available through the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|Master Settlement]], it was found that the executive board of the society and the editorial board of the journal were dominated by paid tobacco-industry consultants. The journal published a large amount of material on passive smoking, much of which was "industry-positive".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garne D, Watson M, Chapman S, Byrne F |title=Environmental tobacco smoke research published in the journal Indoor and Built Environment and associations with the tobacco industry |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9461 |pages=804–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15733724 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17990-2 }}</ref>

Citing the tobacco industry's production of biased research and efforts to undermine scientific findings, the 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report concluded that the industry had "attempted to sustain controversy even as the scientific community reached consensus... industry documents indicate that the tobacco industry has engaged in widespread activities... that have gone beyond the bounds of accepted scientific practice."<ref name="sg-exec-summary"/> The U.S. District Court, in ''U.S.A. v. Philip Morris et al.'', found that "...despite their internal acknowledgment of the hazards of secondhand smoke, Defendants have fraudulently denied that ETS causes disease."<ref>{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|p=1523}}</ref>

==== Position of major tobacco companies ====
The positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of second-hand smoke is somewhat varied. In general, tobacco companies have continued to focus on questioning the methodology of studies showing that second-hand smoke is harmful. Some (such as [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]) acknowledge the medical consensus that second-hand smoke carries health risks, while others continue to assert that the evidence is inconclusive. [[Imperial Tobacco]] describes second-hand smoke as "annoying" and "unpleasant", but denies any associated health risks. Several tobacco companies advocate the creation of smoke-free areas within public buildings as an alternative to comprehensive [[smoking bans|smoke-free laws]].<ref>The most current positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of passive smoking can be found on their websites. As of 13 January 2009, the following websites contain tobacco-industry positions on the topic:

=== US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies ===
On September 22, 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a [[racketeering]] lawsuit against Philip Morris and other major cigarette manufacturers.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/cases/tobacco2/index.htm Litigation Against Tobacco Companies] U.S. Department of Justice</ref> Almost 7 years later, on August 17, 2006 U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler found that the Government had proven its case and that the tobacco company defendants had violated the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)]].<ref name="kessler" /> In particular, Judge Kessler found that PM and other tobacco companies had:
* conspired to minimize, distort and confuse the public about the health hazards of smoking;
* publicly denied, while internally acknowledging, that second-hand tobacco smoke is harmful to nonsmokers, and
* destroyed documents relevant to litigation.
The ruling found that tobacco companies undertook joint efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that second-hand smoke causes disease, notably by controlling research findings via paid consultants. The ruling also concluded that tobacco companies continue today to fraudulently deny the health effects of ETS exposure.<ref name="kessler" />

As a consequence of the health risks associated with second-hand smoke, [[smoking bans|smoke-free regulations]] in indoor public places, including [[restaurant]]s, [[café]]s, and [[nightclub]]s have been introduced in a number of jurisdictions, at national or local level, as well as some outdoor open areas. [http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/smokers_just_daring_bloomberg_to_ti.php 1] [[Ireland]] was the first country in the world to institute an comprehensive national smoke-free law on smoking in all indoor workplaces on 29 March 2004. Since then, many others have followed suit. The countries which have ratified the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (FCTC) have a legal obligation to implement ''effective'' legislation "for protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places." (Article 8 of the FCTC<ref name="framework-treaty" />) The parties to the FCTC have further adopted ''Guidelines on the Protection from Exposure to Second-hand Smoke'' which state that "effective measures to provide protection from exposure to tobacco smoke ... require the total elimination of smoking and tobacco smoke in a particular space or environment in order to create a 100% smoke-free environment."<ref name="fctc-guidelines">{{cite web |title = Guidelines on the Protection from Exposure to Secondhand Smoke |work = [[WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control|Framework Convention for Tobacco Control]] |publisher = [[World Health Organization]] |year = 2007 |accessdate =2009-01-29 |url = http://www.who.int/fctc/cop/art%208%20guidelines_english.pdf |format = PDF}}</ref>

Opinion polls have shown considerable support for smoke-free laws. In June 2007, a survey of 15 countries found 80% approval for smoke-free laws.<ref>[http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=1619&Itemid= Market Research World]</ref> A survey in France, reputedly a nation of smokers, showed 70% support.<ref name="France to ban smoking"/>

=== Effects ===
In the first 18 months after the town of [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Colorado]] enacted a smoke-free law in 2003, hospital admissions for heart attacks dropped 27%. Admissions in neighbouring towns without smoke-free laws showed no change, and the decline in heart attacks in Pueblo was attributed to the resulting reduction in second-hand smoke exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reduced hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance—City of Pueblo, Colorado, 2002–2006 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=57 |issue=51 |pages=1373–7 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19116606 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5751a1.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) }}</ref>

In April, 2010 the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' published a study evaluating the effects of a 10-year, three-stage smoke-free regulatory programme in [[Toronto]]. The study found that during the implementation of a restaurant smoke-free ordinance, hospital admissions for cardiovascular conditions declined by 39%, and admissions for respiratory conditions declined by 33%. No significant reductions in hospital admissions occurred in other cities which did not have smoke-free ordinances. The authors concluded that the study justified further efforts to reduce public exposure to tobacco smoke. In May 2006, Ontario instituted a comprehensive province-wide smoke-free law which extended the restrictions to all cities and municipalities in Ontario.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Naiman A, Glazier RH, Moineddin R |title=Association of anti-smoking legislation with rates of hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions |journal=CMAJ |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20385737 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.091130 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/abstract/cmaj.091130v1 |volume=182 |issue=8 |pages=761–7 |pmc=2871198 }}</ref> However, not all researchers agree that this was a causal relationship, and a 2009 study of many smoke-free ordinances in the United States disagreed with these conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shetty, Kanaka D.,'' et al.'' |title=Changes in U.S. Hospitalization and Mortality Rates Following Smoking Bans |journal=NBER |year=2009 |month=April |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1359506}}</ref>

In 2001, a systematic review for the Guide to Community Preventative Services acknowledged strong evidence of the effectiveness of smoke-free policies and restrictions in reducing expose to second-hand smoke. A follow up to this review, identified the evidence on which the effectiveness of smoking bans reduced the prevalence of tobacco use. Articles published until 2005, were examined to further support this evidence. The examined studies provided sufficient evidence that smoke-free policies reduce tobacco use among workers when implemented in worksites or by communities.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hopkins DP, Razi S, Leeks KD, Priya Kalra G, Chattopadhyay SK, Soler RE | year = 2010 | title = Smokefree policies to reduce tobacco use.

While a number of studies funded by the tobacco industry have claimed a negative economic impact from smoke-free laws, no independently funded research has shown any such impact. A 2003 review reported that independently funded, methodologically sound research consistently found either no economic impact or a positive impact from smoke-free laws.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scollo M, Lal A, Hyland A, Glantz S. |title=Review of the quality of studies on the economic effects of smoke-free policies on the hospitality industry |journal=Tobacco Control |year=2003 |month=Mar |pmid=12612356 |pmc=1759095 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=13–20 |doi=10.1136/tc.12.1.13}}</ref>

Air nicotine levels were measured in Guatemalan bars and restaurants before and after an implemented smoke-free law in 2009. Nicotine concentrations significantly decreased in both the bars and restaurants measured. Also, the employees support for a smoke-free workplace substantially increased in the post-implementation survey compared to pre-implementation survey. The result of this smoke-free law provides a considerably more healthy work environment for the staff.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barnoya J, Arvizu M, Jones MR, Hernandez JC, Breysse PN, Navas-Acien A |title=Secondhand smoke exposure in bars and restaurants in Guatemala City: before and after smoking ban evaluation |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=151–6 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=21046446 |doi=10.1007/s10552-010-9673-8 }}</ref>

=== Public opinion ===
Recent surveys taken by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco demonstrates supportive attitudes of the public, towards smoke-free policies in outdoor areas. A vast majority of the public supports restricting smoking in various outdoor settings. The respondents reasons for supporting the polices were for varying reasons such as, litter control, establishing positive smoke-free role models for youth, reducing youth opportunities to smoke, and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomson G, Wilson N, Edwards R |title=At the frontier of tobacco control: a brief review of public attitudes toward smoke-free outdoor places |journal=Nicotine Tob. Res. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=584–90 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19359392 |doi=10.1093/ntr/ntp046 |url=http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19359392}}</ref>

=== Alternative forms ===
Alternatives to smoke-free laws have also been proposed as a means of [[harm reduction]], particularly in bars and restaurants. For example, critics of smoke-free laws cite studies suggesting ventilation as a means of reducing tobacco smoke pollutants and improving air quality.<ref>{{cite web |work = Building Sustainable Design |url = http://www.bsjonline.co.uk/story.asp?storyType=85&sectioncode=95&storyCode=3047478 |title = No ifs or butts |date = March 2005 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |first = Andrew |last = Geens |coauthors = Max Graham}}</ref> Ventilation has also been heavily promoted by the tobacco industry as an alternative to outright bans, via a network of ostensibly independent experts with often undisclosed ties to the industry.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drope J, Bialous SA, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts to present ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free environments in North America |journal=Tob Control |volume=13 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=i41–7 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14985616 |pmc=1766145 |doi= 10.1136/tc.2003.004101|url=http://tc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14985616 |quote = The industry developed a network of ventilation 'experts' to promote its position that smoke-free environments were not necessary, often without disclosing the financial relationship between these experts and the industry. }}</ref> However, not all critics have connections to the industry.

The [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) officially concluded in 2005 that while completely isolated smoking rooms do eliminate the risk to nearby non-smoking areas, smoking bans are the only means of completely eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure.  They further concluded that no system of dilution or cleaning was effective at eliminating risk.<ref name="ASHRAE">{{cite web |url = http://www.ashrae.org/content/ASHRAE/ASHRAE/ArticleAltFormat/20058211239_347.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] |date = June 30, 2005 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |title = Environmental Tobacco Smoke: Position Document}}</ref> The [[U.S. Surgeon General]] and the [[European Commission Joint Research Centre]] have reached similar conclusions.<ref name="sg-exec-summary">{{cite web |title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke |publisher = [[Surgeon General of the United States]] |work = Executive Summary |year = 2006 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |url = http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/executivesummary.pdf |format = PDF}}</ref><ref name="ecjrc">{{cite web |publisher = [[European Commission]] [[Joint Research Centre]] |title = Institute for Health and Consumer Protection Activity Report 2003 |year = 2003 |url = http://ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/docs/IHCP_annual_report/ihcp03.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate =2009-01-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The implementation guidelines for the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] states that engineering approaches, such as ventilation, are ineffective and do not protect against second-hand smoke exposure.<ref name="fctc-guidelines" /> However, this does ''not'' necessarily mean that such measures are useless in reducing harm, only that they fall short of the goal of reducing exposure completely to zero.

Others have suggested a system of [[tradable smoking pollution permits]], similar to the [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] pollution permits systems used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in recent decades to curb other types of pollution.<ref>{{cite news |title = Let Bars Buy, Sell Smoking Permits |url = http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/madison.com/html/archive_files/wsj/2005/09/25/0509240280.php |first = Robert |last = Haveman |coauthors = John Mullahy |work = [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |date = September 25, 2005 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |page = B2}}</ref> This would guarantee that a portion of bars/restaurants in a jurisdiction will be smoke free, while leaving the decision to the market.

==In other animals==
{{main|Animals and tobacco smoke}}

Multiple studies have been conducted to determine the carcinogenicity of environmental tobacco smoke to animals. These studies typically fall under the categories of simulated environmental tobacco smoke, administering condensates of [[sidestream smoke]], or observational studies of cancer among pets.

To simulate environmental tobacco smoke, scientists expose animals to sidestream smoke, that which emanates from the cigarette's burning cone and through its paper, or a combination of mainstream and sidestream smoke.<ref name=IARC2004/> The IARC monographs conclude that mice with prolonged exposure to simulated environmental tobacco smoke, that is 6hrs a day, 5 days a week, for five months with a subsequent 4 month interval before dissection, will have significantly higher incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors than with control groups.

The IARC monographs concluded that sidestream smoke condensates had a significantly higher carcinogenic effect on mice than did mainstream smoke condensates.<ref name=IARC2004/>

===Observational studies===
Second-hand smoke is popularly recognised as a risk factor for cancer in pets.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.livescience.com/animals/070831_pets_smoking.html |title = Secondhand Smoke Causes Cancer in Pets |first = Andrea |last = Thompson |publisher = LiveScience |date = 2007-08-31 |accessdate = 2007-08-31}}</ref> A study conducted by the [[Tufts University|Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] linked the occurrence of feline oral cancer to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke through an overexpression of the [[p53]] gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Snyder LA, Bertone ER, Jakowski RM, Dooner MS, Jennings-Ritchie J, Moore AS. |title=p53 expression and environmental tobacco smoke exposure in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma |journal=Vet Pathol |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=209–14 |year=2004 |pmid=15133168 |doi=10.1354/vp.41-3-209 }}</ref> Another study conducted at the same universities concluded that cats living with a smoker were more likely to get [[feline lymphoma]]; the risk increased with the duration of exposure to secondhand smoke and the number of smokers in the household.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Bertone ER, Snyder LA, Moore AS. |title= Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Risk of Malignant Lymphoma in Pet Cats |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=156 |issue=3 |pages=268–273 |year=2002 |pmid=12142262 |doi= 10.1093/aje/kwf044 |ref= harv}}</ref> A study by [[Colorado State University]] researchers, looking at cases of canine lung cancer, was generally inconclusive, though the authors reported a weak relation for lung cancer in dogs exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. The number of smokers within the home, the number of packs smoked in the home per day, and the amount of time that the dog spent within the home had no effect on the dog's risk for lung cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reif JS, Dunn K, Ogilvie GK, Harris CK. |title=Passive smoking and canine lung cancer risk |journal=Am J Epidemiol. |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=234–9 |year=1992 |pmid=1546698 }}</ref>

====Animal nicotine poisoning====
Animals like dogs, cats, squirrels, and other small animals are affected by not only second-hand smoke inhalation, but also [[nicotine poisoning]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Domestic pets, especially dogs, usually fall ill when owners leave nicotine products like cigarette butts, chewing tobacco, or nicotine gum within reach of the animal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Littered cigarette butts from smokers are a problem for small animals that mistake them for food if they find them on sidewalks or trashcans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Novotny TE, Hardin SN, Hovda LR, Novotny DJ, McLean MK, Khan S |title=Tobacco and cigarette butt consumption in humans and animals |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=20 Suppl 1 |issue= Suppl_1|pages=i17–20 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21504918 |pmc=3088460 |doi=10.1136/tc.2011.043489 |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21504918}}</ref> [[Cigarette butt]]s are the remains of a cigarette after smoking which contain the [[cigarette filter|filter]] which is meant to contain tar, particles, and toxins from the cigarette such as ammonia, arsenic, benzene, turpentine and other [[List of additives in cigarettes|toxins]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
