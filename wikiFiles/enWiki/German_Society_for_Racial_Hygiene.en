The '''German Society for Racial Hygiene''' ({{lang-de|'''Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Rassenhygiene'''}}) was an organization founded on June 22, 1905 by the physician [[Alfred Ploetz]] in [[Berlin]]. Its goal was for society to return to a healthy and blooming, strong and beautiful life" as Ploetz put it. The [[Nordic race]] was supposed to regain its "purity" through [[selective reproduction]] and [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]].<ref>Schafft, Gretchen Engle: "From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich". University of Illinois Press. 2004. Pg. 42.</ref>

At the time the society received generous support by the imperial government and it was the only organization of its kind in the world. Since Ploetz wanted to establish an international movement, the society was soon renamed International Society for Racial Hygiene with branches in [[Berlin]] including [[Erwin Bauer]], [[Munich]], and [[Freiburg]] with the well-known human geneticists [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Eugen Fischer]] and from 1910 [[Stuttgart]], which included the geneticist [[Wilhelm Weinberg]].<ref>Carlson, Elof Axel: "The Unfit: a history of a bad idea".

Pg. 321.</ref> Branches in Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands were also established in the early 20th century.<ref>Schafft 2002, pg. 42</ref> In 1924, the organization was named back to German Society for Racial Hygiene.<ref>Hubbard, Ruth: "Abortion and Disability: Who Should and Should not Inhabit the World" in Davis, Lennard J.

By 1933, the Society for Racial Hygiene had 1,300 members, many of them academics, as well as high functionaries in the [[NSDAP]].<ref>Burleigh, Michael; Wippermann, Wolfgang: "The Racial State: Germany 1933-1945". Cambridge University Press. 1991. Pg. 52.</ref>

The society wanted to establish "[[Racial Hygiene]]/[[Eugenics]]" as a scientific subject and contributed substantially to their implementation in [[Germany]]. With both adoption of the ideas of "Racial Hygiene" by the [[Nazism|National Socialist movement]] and with concrete consultations on political racial measures, the society took directly to influence on important law changes, which were integral part of the National Socialist regime led by [[Adolf Hitler]].
