'''Anthropometry''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]  ''anthropos'' (άνθρωπος - "man") and ''metron'' (μέτρον - "measure") therefore "measurement of man") refers to the measurement of the human individual. An early tool of [[biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], it has been used for identification,  for the purposes of understanding human physical variation, in [[paleoanthropology]] and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits. 

Today, anthropometry plays an important role in [[industrial design]], [[clothing]] design, [[ergonomics]] and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in life styles, nutrition and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e.g. the [[obesity]] epidemic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections.

==Craniometry and paleoanthropology==

{{Further|Paleoanthropology|Biological anthropology}}
In 1784 [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]], who wrote many essays on [[comparative anatomy]] for the [[Académie française]], published his ''Memoir on the Different Positions of the [[Foramina of the skull#List of foramina|Occipital Foramen]] in Man and Animals'' (''Mémoire sur les différences de la situation du grand trou occipital dans l’homme et dans les animaux''). Six years later [[Pieter Camper]] (1722–1789), distinguished both as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures that laid the foundation of much work. Camper invented the "[[facial angle]]", a measure meant to determine [[animal intelligence|intelligence]] among various species. According to this technique, a "facial angle" was formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the [[nostril]] to the [[ear]]; and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper [[Human jawbone|jawbone]] to the most prominent part of the [[forehead]]. Camper's measurements of facial angle were first made to compare the skulls of men with those of other animals. Camper claimed that antique statues presented an angle of 90°, Europeans of 80°, Central Africans of 70° and the orangutan of 58°.

Swedish professor of anatomy [[Anders Retzius]] (1796–1860) first used the [[cephalic index]] in [[physical anthropology]] to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. He classed skulls in three main categories; "dolichocephalic" (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''kephalê'', head, and ''dolikhos'', long and thin), "brachycephalic" (short and broad) and "mesocephalic" (intermediate length and width).  Scientific research was continued by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772–1844) and [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880), founder of the Anthropological Society in France in 1859. Paleoanthropologists still rely upon craniofacial anthropometry to identify species in the study of fossilized hominid bones. Specimens of ''Homo erectus'' and athletic specimens of ''Homo sapiens'', for example, are virtually identical from the neck down but their skulls can easily be told apart.

[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), whose two major monographs were the ''Crania Americana'' (1839), ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca'' (1844) concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not [[African]] but [[White people|white]] and that caucasians and negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since ''The Bible'' indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years before this Noah's sons could not account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of [[polygenism]] the races had been separate from the start.<ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41">David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity, 2001, pp. 38 - 41</ref> [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] carried Morton's ideas further.<ref>Josiah C. Nott and George Gliddon, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854)</ref> Charles Darwin, who thought the [[single-origin hypothesis]] essential to [[evolutionary theory]], opposed Nott and Gliddon in his 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', arguing for [[monogenism]].
[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|280px| '''Pithecometra''': In the frontispiece from his 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', [[Thomas Huxley]] compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]

In 1856 workers found in a limestone quarry the skull of a [[Neanderthal]] man, thinking it to be the remains of a bear. They gave the material to amateur naturalist [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] who turned the fossils over to anatomist [[Hermann Schaaffhausen]]. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857, giving rise to the discipline of [[paleoanthropology]]. By comparing skeletons of apes to man [[T. H. Huxley]] (1825–1895) backed up [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], first expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), and developed the  "[[Pithecometra principle]]" which stated that man and ape were descended from a common ancestor.

[[Eugène Dubois]]' (1858–1940) discovery in 1891 in Indonesia of the "[[Java Man]]", the first specimen of [[Homo erectus]] to be discovered, demonstrated mankind's deep ancestry outside Europe. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) became famous for his "[[recapitulation theory]]", according to which each individual mirrors the evolution of the whole species during his life.

{{Further|Phrenology|Physiognomy}}
[[Intelligence testing]] was compared with anthropometrics. [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851) collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world and started trying to find a way to classify them according to some logical criterion. Morton claimed that he could judge intellectual capacity by [[cranial capacity]]. A large skull meant a large [[Human brain|brain]] and high intellectual capacity, a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. Modern science has since confirmed that there is a correlation between cranium size (measured in various ways) and intelligence as measured by IQ tests, although it is a weak correlation at about 0.2. Today, brain volume as measured with MRI scanners also find a correlation between cranium size and intelligence at about 0.4.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rushton|first=J. Philippe|coauthors=Ankney, C. Davison|title=Whole Brain Size and General Mental Ability: A Review|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|date=1 January 2009|volume=119|issue=5|pages=692–732|doi=10.1080/00207450802325843}}</ref> 

Craniometry was also used in [[phrenology]], which purported to determine character, personality traits, and criminality on the basis of the shape of the head. At the turn of the 18th to 19th century, [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1822) developed "cranioscopy" (Ancient Greek ''kranion'' - "skull", ''scopos'' - "vision"), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy was later renamed phrenology (''phrenos'': mind, ''logos'': study) by his student [[Johann Spurzheim]] (1776–1832), who wrote extensively on "Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's [[physiognomy|physiognomical]] System." These all claimed the ability to predict traits or intelligence and were intensively practised in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century.

During the 1940s anthropometry was used by [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] when evaluating his [[somatotype]]s, according to which characteristics of the body can be translated into characteristics of the mind. Inspired by [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s [[criminal anthropology]], he also believed that [[criminality]] could be predicted according to the body type.  A basically anthropometric division of [[body type]]s into the categories [[endomorphic]], [[ectomorphic]] and [[mesomorphic]] derived from Sheldon's [[somatotype]] theories is today popular among people doing [[weight training]].

==Forensic anthropometry==
{{Further|Forensic anthropology|Anthropological criminology}}

Forensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological  profile. Forensic anthropologists utilize the [[Fordisc]] program to help in the interpretation of craniofacial measurements in regards to ancestry/race determination.

One part of a biological profile is a person's racial/ancestral affinity. People with considerable European ancestry generally have relatively no [[prognathism]]; a relatively small face; a narrow, tear-shaped nasal cavity; a "silled" nasal aperture; tower-shaped nasal bones; a triangular-shaped palate; and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape. People with considerable East Asian ancestry are often characterized by a relatively small prognathism; no nasal sill or dam; an oval-shaped nasal cavity; tent-shaped nasal bones; a horseshoe-shaped palate; and a rounded and non-sloping eye orbit shape.<ref>[http://www.redwoods.edu/Instruct/AGarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm Forensic Anthropology - Ancestry]</ref> Many of these characteristics are only a matter of frequency among particular races: their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into a racial group.

===Bertillon, Galton and criminology===
[[File:Galton at Bertillon's (1893).jpg|left|thumb|180px|A Bertillon record for [[Francis Galton]], from a visit to Bertillon's laboratory in 1893.]]
In 1883, Frenchman [[Alphonse Bertillon]] introduced a system of [[Body identification|identification]] that was named after him.  The "Bertillonage" system was based on the finding that several measures of physical features, such as the dimensions of bony structures in the body, remain fairly constant throughout adult life. Bertillon concluded that when these measurements were made and recorded systematically, every individual would be distinguishable. Bertillon's goal was a way of identifying [[recidivism|recidivists]] ("repeat offenders"). Previously police could only record general descriptions. Photography of criminals had become commonplace but there was no easy way to sort the many thousands of photographs except by name. Bertillon's hope was that, through the use of measurements, a set of identifying numbers could be entered into a filing system installed in one single cabinet.
[[File:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|thumb|right|250px|A chart from Bertillon's ''Identification anthropométrique'' (1893), demonstrating how to take measurements for his identification system.]]
The system involved ten measurements; ''height'', ''stretch'' (distance from left [[shoulder]] to [[middle finger]] of raised right  arm), ''bust'' ([[torso]] from head to seat when seated), ''head length'' crown to forehead and ''width'' temple to temple, ''width'' of [[cheeks]] and length of the ''right [[ear]]'' and the ''left [[foot]], [[middle finger]]'' and ''[[cubit]]'' (elbow to tip of middle finger). It was possible, by exhaustion, to sort the cards on which these details were recorded (together with a photograph) until a small number produced the measurements of the individual sought, independently of names.

The system was soon adapted to police methods: it prevented impersonation and could demonstrate wrongdoing. Bertillonage was before long represented in Paris by a collection of some 100,000 cards and became popular in several other countries' justice systems. England followed suit when in 1894 a committee was sent to Paris to investigate the methods and its results, reporting favorably on the use of measurements for primary classification but also recommending the partial adoption of the system of [[finger print]]s suggested by [[Francis Galton]] and currently in use in [[Bengal]], where measurements were abandoned in 1897 after the finger print system was adopted throughout British India. Three years later England followed suit and, as the result of a fresh inquiry ordered by the Home Office, relied upon finger prints alone.

Bertillonage exhibited certain defects and was gradually supplanted by the system of [[fingerprint|finger print]]s and, latterly, [[genetics]]. Bertillon originally measured variables he thought were independent - such as forearm length and leg length - but Galton had realized that both were the result of a single causal variable (in this case, stature) and  developed the statistical concept of [[correlation]]. It was also difficult to tell whether individuals arrested were first-time offenders. Instruments employed were costly and liable to break down, skilled measurers were needed, errors were frequent and all but irremediable and it was necessary to repeat measurements three times to arrive at a mean result.

===Physiognomy===
{{Main|Physiognomy}}
Physiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909), the founder of [[anthropological criminology]], who claimed to be able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a "[[born criminal]]" and arguing in favor of [[biological determinism]], Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large [[jaw]]s, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high [[cheekbone]]s, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped [[ear]]s; hawk-like [[Human nose|nose]]s or fleshy [[lip]]s; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.

==Phylogeography, race and human origins==
{{Main|Phylogeography}}.

Phylogeography is the science of identifying and tracking major [[human migrations]], especially in prehistoric times. Linguistics can follow the movement of languages and archaeology can follow the movement of artefact styles but neither can tell whether a culture's spread was due to a source population's physically migrating or to a destination population's simply copying the technology and learning the language. Anthropometry was used extensively by anthropologists studying human and racial origins: some attempted racial differentiation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|classification]], often seeking ways in which certain races were inferior to others.<ref>"From Savage to Negro" (1998) Lee D. Baker p.14</ref><ref>"The Mismeasure of Man" Stephen Jay Gould (1981)</ref> Nott translated [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855), a founding work of racial segregationism that made three main divisions between races, based not on colour but on climatic conditions and geographic location, and privileged the "Aryan" race.   Science has tested many theories aligning race and personality, which have been current since [[Boulainvilliers]] (1658–1722)  contrasted the ''[[French people|Français]]'' (French people), alleged descendants of the Nordic [[Franks]], and members of the [[aristocracy]], to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], considered to be indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] people subordinated by [[right of conquest]].

[[François Bernier]], [[Carolus Linnaeus]] and Blumenbach had examined multiple observable human characteristics in search of a typology. Bernier based his racial classification on physical type which included hair shape, nose shape and skin color. Linnaeus based a similar racial classification scheme. As anthropologists gained access to methods of skull measure they developed racial classification based on skull shape.

Theories of [[scientific racism]] became popular, one prominent figure being [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936), who in ''L'Aryen et son rôle social'' (1899 - "The [[Aryan]] and his social role") divided [[human race|humanity]] into various, hierarchized, different " [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]", spanning from the "[[Aryan]] white race, dolichocephalic" to the "brachycephalic" (short and broad-headed) race. Between these Vacher de Lapouge identified the "''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.) and the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Napolitano]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.). "Homo africanus" (Congo, Florida) was excluded from discussion. His racial classification ("Teutonic", "Alpine" and "Mediterranean") was also used by [[William Z. Ripley]] (1867–1941) who, in ''[[The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), made a map of [[Europe]] according to the cephalic index of its inhabitants.

Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of [[Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] and [[Nazi policies|Nazi ideology]].<ref>See [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang - Doctrines racistes à la française'' ("Colour and Blood - doctrines ''à la française''"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du préjugé - Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La Découverte, 1987, 644 pages</ref> [[Nazi Germany]] relied on anthropometric measurements to distinguish [[Aryan]]s from [[Jew]]s and many forms of anthropometry were used for the advocacy of [[eugenics]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, though, members of the school of [[cultural anthropology]] of [[Franz Boas]] began to use anthropometric approaches to discredit the concept of fixed biological race.  Boas used the cephalic index to show the influence of environmental factors. Researches on skulls and skeletons eventually helped liberate 19th century European science from its [[ethnocentric]] bias.<ref name=HuxAI>"Cultural Biases Reflected in the Hominid Fossil Record" (history), by Joshua Barbach and Craig Byron, 2005, ''ArchaeologyInfo.com'' webpage: [http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/perspectives003.htm ArchaeologyInfo-003].</ref> This school of physical anthropology generally went into decline during the 1940s.

===Race and brain size===
Several studies have demonstrated correlations between race and brain size, with varying results. In some studies, Caucasians were reported to have larger brains than other racial groups, whereas in recent studies and reanalysis of previous studies, East Asians were reported as having larger brains and skulls. More common among the studies was the report that Africans had smaller skulls than either Caucasians or East Asians. Criticisms have been raised against a number of these studies regarding questionable methods.

[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|200px|An 1839 drawing by [[Samuel George Morton]] of "a Negro head… a Caucasian skull… a Mongol head."]]
In ''Crania Americana'' Morton claimed that Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.<ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41"/> In 1873 [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880) found the same pattern described by Samuel Morton's ''Crania Americana'' by weighing brains at [[autopsy]]. Other historical studies alleging a Black-White difference in brain size include Bean (1906), Mall, (1909), Pearl, (1934) and Vint (1934). But in Germany [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s study led him to denounce "[[Nordic theory|Nordic mysticism]]" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]]. [[Josef Kollmann]], a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a "mixture of various races," furthermore declaring that the "results of craniology" led to "struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race".<ref name=Orsucci>Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)], ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{it icon}}</ref> Virchow later rejected measure of skulls as legitimate means of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. [[Paul Kretschmer]] quoted an 1892 discussion with him concerning these criticisms, also citing [[Aurel von Törok]]'s 1895 work, who basically proclaimed the failure of craniometry.<ref name=Orsucci/>

Stephen Jay Gould (1941–2002) claimed Samuel Morton had fudged data and "overpacked" the skulls.<ref>Stephen Jay Gould, ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'', (1981)</ref> A subsequent study by John Michael concluded that "[c]ontrary to Gould's interpretation...

They identified and remeasured half of the skulls used in Morton’s reports, finding that in only 2% of cases did Morton’s measurements differ significantly from their own and that these errors either were random or gave a larger than accurate volume to African skulls, the reverse of the bias that Dr. Gould imputed to Morton.<ref name="jelewis">Lewis, Jason E., DeGusta, D., Meyer, M.R., Monge, J.M., Mann, A.E., et al.

[[J. Philippe Rushton]], psychologist and author of the controversial work ''[[Race, Evolution and Behavior]]'' (1995), reanalyzed Gould's retabulation in 1989, and argued that Samuel Morton, in his 1839 book ''Crania Americana'', had shown a pattern of decreasing brain size proceeding from East Asians, Europeans, and Africans. Rushton alleged an average endocranial volume of 1,364&nbsp;cm³ for [[East Asians]], 1,347 for [[Caucasian race|white Caucasians]] and 1,268 for [[African|black Africans]].

Similar claims were previously made by Ho et al. (1980), who measured 1,261 brains at autopsy, and Beals et al. (1984), who measured approximately 20,000 skulls, finding the same [[East Asian]] → [[Europe]]an → [[African]] pattern but warning against using the findings as indicative of racial traits, "If one merely lists such means by geographical region or race, causes of similarity by genogroup and ecotype are hopelessly confounded".<ref name="beals">[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2742800 Kenneth L.

===Race, identity and cranio-facial description===

Observable craniofacial differences included: head shape (mesocephalic, brachycephalic, doliocephalic) breadth of nasal aperture, nasal root height, sagittal crest appearance, jaw thickness, brow ridge size and forehead slope. Using this skull-based categorization, anthropologists{{who|date=October 2011}} identified three or four racial groups;

*[[Caucasoid]] characterized by a tall dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas, large brow ridge and projecting-narrow nasal apertures.

*[[Negroid]] characterized by a short dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas and wide nasal apertures.

*[[Mongoloid]] characterized by a medium brachycephalic skull, projecting zygomas, small brow ridge and small nasal apertures.

Ripley's ''The Races of Europe'' was rewritten in 1939 by Harvard physical anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]]. [[Carleton S. Coon]], a 20th century craniofacial anthropometrist, used the technique for his ''The Origin of Races'' (New York: Knopf, 1962). Because of the inconsistencies in the old three-part system (Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid), Coon adopted a five-part scheme. He defined "Caucasoid" as a pattern of skull measurements and other phenotypical characteristics typical of populations in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], and Northeast Africa ([[Ethiopia]], and [[Somalia]]). He discarded the term "Negroid" as misleading since it implies skin-tone, which is found at low latitudes around the globe and is a product of adaptation, and defined skulls typical of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] as "Congoid" and those of [[Southern Africa]] as "Capoid". Finally, he split "Australoid" from "Mongoloid" along a line roughly similar to the modern distinction between sinodonts in the north and sundadonts in the south. He argued that these races had developed independently of each other over the past half-million years, developing into Homo Sapiens at different periods of time, resulting in different levels of civilization. This raised considerable controversy and led the [[American Anthropological Association]] to reject his approach without mentioning him by name.<ref>Marks, Jonathan ''What it means to be 98% Chimpanzee'' University of California Press, 2002, ISBN 978-0-520-24064-3 pp. 76-77 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HUBe0wjowLMC&pg=PA76&dq=coon+%22origin+of+races%22&ei=GqDKSLzvDZX4iQGF4KX3Cw&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U1EeYDoitthqhZ9pvsJmzVAqFLQMA#PPA76,M1]</ref>

In ''[[The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) Coon classified Caucasoids into racial sub-groups named after regions or archaeological sites such as Brünn, Borreby, Alpine, Ladogan, East Baltic, Neo-Danubian, Lappish, Mediterranean, Atlanto-Mediterranean, Irano-Afghan, Nordic, Hallstatt, Keltic, Tronder, Dinaric, Noric and Armenoid. This typological view of race, however, was starting to be seen as out-of-date at the time of publication. Coon eventually resigned from the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]], while some of his other works were discounted because he would not agree with the evidence brought forward by [[Franz Boas]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Leonard Lieberman]] and others.<ref>[http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/Lieberman2001CA.pdf How Caucasoids Got Such Big Crania and How They Shrank], by Leonard Lieberman</ref>

Although craniofacial race categorization based on skull indices is unambiguous,<ref>[http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/osteo/forensics/race.html Forensic Anthropology.

==Modern anthropometry and biometrics==

[[File:Anthropometry exhibit.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Anthropometry demonstrated in an exhibit from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference.]]
Anthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other large-bodied mammals, following [[Bergmann's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates, and [[Allen's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter, stubbier limbs than those in warm climates.  

On a micro evolutionary level anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct small-scale population history. For instance John Relethford's studies of early 20th-century anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago. 

Scientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items. Measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of [[footwear]]: measurement devices may be used either to determine a retail shoe size directly (e.g. the [[Brannock Device]]) or to determine the detailed dimensions of the foot for custom manufacture (e.g. [[ALINEr]]).<ref>Goonetilleke, R. S., Ho, Edmond Cheuk Fan, and So, R. H. Y. (1997). Foot Anthropometry in Hong Kong . Proceedings of the ASEAN 97 Conference, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1997. pp. 81-88.</ref>

The US Military has conducted over 40 anthropometric surveys of U.S. Military personnel between 1945 and 1988, including the 1988 Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) of men and women with its 240 measures.  Statistical data from these surveys encompasses over 75,000 individuals.<ref>[http://assist.daps.dla.mil/docimages/0000/40/29/54083.PD0  U.S. Military personnel]</ref> 

Today anthropometry can be performed with three-dimensional scanners. A global collaborative study to examine the uses of three-dimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study [http://www.bodybenchmark.org] will investigate the use of three-dimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan. The aim is to establish whether The [[Body volume index|Body Volume Index]] has the potential to be used as a long-term computer based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey using scanners up to date. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico & Size Thailand, the latter still ongoing. Size UK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women's survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65&nbsp;kg.

Direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses, or more recently, imaging techniques such as [[MRI]], which can be used on living persons. Such measurements is used research on [[neuroscience and intelligence]]. Brain volume data and other craniometric data is used in mainstream science to compare modern-day animal species, and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archeology. With the discovery that many [[blood proteins]] vary consistently among populations, followed by the discovery of the DNA code, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] that amplifies trace amounts of DNA, and the decoding of the [[human genome]], phylogeographers largely switched away from craniofacial anthropometry whenever DNA is available.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Anthropometric measurements also have uses in medical anthropology and [[epidemiology]], for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements (height, weight, percentage body fat, etc.) and medical outcomes.  Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to diagnose [[malnutrition]] in resource-poor clinical settings.

In art [[Yves Klein]] termed '''anthropometries''' his performance paintings where he covered nude women with paint, and used their bodies as paintbrushes.
