'''''Cryptococcus''''' (Latin for "hidden sphere") is a [[genus]] of [[fungus]]. These fungi grow in culture as [[yeast]]s. The sexual forms or [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]s of ''Cryptococcus'' species are filamentous fungi in the genus ''[[Filobasidiella]]''. The name ''Cryptococcus'' is used when referring to the [[Fungi imperfecti|yeast states]] of the fungi.

==General characteristics==
The cells of these species are covered in a thin layer of glycoprotein capsular material that has a gelatin-like consistency and that, among other functions, serves to help extract nutrients from the soil. But ''C. neoformans'' capsule is different in being richer in glucuronic acid and mannose, having O-acetyl groups,<ref>Ross A, Taylor IE (1981) Extracellular glycoprotein from virulent and avirulent Cryptococcus species. Infection and Immunity. 31(3):911–8</ref> and functioning as the major virulence factor in cryptococcal infection and disease.<ref>Casadevall A and Perfect JR (1998) Cryptococcus neoformans.

==Infectious species==
There are about 37 recognized species of ''Cryptococcus'', but the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the group is currently being re-evaluated with up-to-date methods. The majority of species live in the soil and are not harmful to humans. Very common species include ''Cryptococcus laurentii'' and ''Cryptococcus albidus''. Of all species, ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' is the major human and animal pathogen. However, ''Cryptococcus laurentii'' and ''Cryptococcus albidus'' have been known to occasionally cause moderate-to-severe disease, specifically [[meningitis]], in human patients with compromised immunity (owing to HIV infection, cancer chemotherapy, metabolic immunosuppression, ''et cetera'').<ref>Cheng MF, Chiou CC, Liu YC, Wang HZ, Hsieh KS (2001) ''Cryptococcus laurentii'' fungemia in a premature neonate.

===''C. neoformans''===
'''''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]''''' is the most prominent medically important [[species]]. It is best known for causing a severe form of [[meningitis]] and meningo-[[encephalitis]] in people with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].  It may also infect organ transplant recipients and people receiving certain cancer treatments.<ref name=CDC />  ''C. neoformans'' is found in the droppings of wild birds, often pigeons; when dust of the droppings is stirred up it can infect humans or pets that inhale the dust.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/crptococcus.htm |title= What is Cryptococcus infection (cryptococcosis)?|author= |date=April 28, 2010 |work= |publisher= Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> Infected humans and animals do not transmit their infection to others; they are not infectious.<ref name=CDC />  When plated on Niger or birdseed agar ''C. neoformans'' produces melanin, which causes the colonies to have a brown color, and it is believed that this melanin production may be an important virulance factor.<ref name="Labrecque O. 2005">Labrecque O., Sylvestre D. and Messier S.

===''C. gattii''===
'''''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]''''' (formerly ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' var ''gattii'') is endemic to tropical parts of the continent of Africa and Australia. It is capable of causing disease ([[cryptococcosis]]) in non-immunocompromised people. It has been isolated from [[eucalyptus]] trees in Australia. Since 1999, there has been an outbreak of ''Cryptococcus gattii'' infections in eastern [[Vancouver Island]],<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lindberg J, Hagen F, Laursen A, ''et al.'' | title=Cryptococcus gattii Risk for Tourists Visiting Vancouver Island, Canada | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | year=2007 | volume=13 | pages=178–79 | doi=10.3201/eid1301.060945 | pmid=17370544 | issue=1 | pmc=2725802}}</ref> an area not generally thought to be endemic for this organism.

===''C. albidus''===
'''''Cryptococcus albidus''''' is a species that has been isolated from Air, dry moss in Portugal, grasshopers in Portugal and Tubercular lungs.<ref>Fonseca A., Scorzeti G., and Fell J. (2000) Diversity in the yeast Cryptococcus albidus and related species as revealed by ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. Can. J. Microbiol. 46:7-27</ref> The colonies on a macroscopic level, are cream colored to pale pink, with the majority of colonies being smooth with a mucoid appearance. Some of the colonies have been found to be rough and wrinkled, but this is a rare occurrence.<ref name="doctorfungus.org">http://www.doctorfungus.org/thefungi/Cryptococcus_albidus.php Results from a search on Doctor Fungus</ref> This species is very similar to ''Cryptococcus neoformans'', but can be differentiated because it is phenol oxidase negative, and when grown on Niger or birdseed agar  ''C. neoformans'' produces melanin causing the cells to take on a brown color while the ''C. albidus'' cells stay cream colored.<ref name="Labrecque O. 2005"/><ref name="ReferenceA">(2006) 0609-1 Cryptococcus albidus. Cmpt Mycology Plus</ref> On a microscopic level ''C. albidus'' has an ovoid shape, and when viewed with India ink it is apparent that a capsule is present. This species also reproduces through budding. The formation of pseudohyphae has not been seen. ''C. albidus'' is able to use glucose, citric acid, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, salicin, cellobiose, and  inositol, as well as many other compounds, as sole carbon sources. This species is also able to use potassium nitrate as a nitrogen source. ''C. albidus'' produces urease, as is common for ''Cryptococcus'' species.<ref>Cryptococcus albidus. Mycology Online. The University of Adelaide. http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Fungal_Descriptions/Yeasts/Cryptococcus/C_albidus.html</ref> ''Cryptococcus albidus'' is very easily mistaken for other ''Cryptococcus'' species, as well as species from other genus of yeast, and as such should be allowed to grow for a minimum of seven days before attempting to identify this species. While this species is most frequently fount in water and plants and is also found on animal and human skin, it is not frequently a human pathogen. Cases of ''C. albidus'' infection have increased in humans of the past few years, and it has caused ocular and systemic disease in those with immunoincompetent systems, for example, patients with AIDS, leukemia or lymphoma.<ref name="doctorfungus.org"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> While systemic infections have been found with increasing regularity in humans, it is still relatively rare in animals. To date there have only been two cases of infection in horses, a case of systemic infection in a house cat, and in 2005 the first confirmed case of ''C. albidus'' systemic infection in a dog was confirmed. It is believed that ''C. albidus'' entered unencapsulated the [[Doberman Pinscher]], Daisy, through her [[lung]]s, and infected the lung tissue. It is also believed that once the infection was imbedded in Daisy’s lung tissue, the yeast became encapsulated, the presence of this important virulence factor allowed ''C. albidus'' to spread through her system. While immunodeficiency seems to be required for a systemic infection of ''C. albidus'' to occur in humans, this does not appear to be the case in animals, though further studies will have to be done to confirm whether or not this is the case in animals. One thing that is confirmed is that a systemic infection in animals is typically seen when antibiotics are administered for extended periods of time. The only accepted treatment in humans and animals is the long-term administration of [[amphotericin B]]. The administration of amphotericin B in animals has been successful, but in humans the treatment usually has poor results.<ref name="Labrecque O. 2005"/> ''Cryptococcus albidus var. albidus'' is a variety of ''C. albidus'' that has been considered unique. It differs from ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' because of its ability to assimilate lactose not galactose. This species is also considered unique because its strains have a maximum temperature range from between 25°C and 37°C. This is important because it violates van Uden’s rule, because it states that the yeast strains of a particular species cannot have their maximum growth temperature vary by more than 5°C.<ref>Vishniac H. S., Kurtzman C. P. (1992) Cryptococcus anarcticus sp. nov. and Cryptococcus albidosimilis sp. nov., Basidioblasomycetes from Antarctic Soils. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 42(4) 547-553</ref>  However, there is some debate as to whether or not this maximum temperature range for the strains of ''C. albidus'' is accurate, because other research as shown that ''C. albidus var. albidus'' strains cannot grow at 37°C.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Another variety, ''Cryptococcus albidus var. diffluens'' is different from ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' in that it can assimilate melibiose not galactose.<ref name="Labrecque O. 2005"/>

===''C. uniguttulas''===
'''''Cryptococcus uniguttulas''''' (''Fliobasidium uniguttulatus'' is a teleomorph) was the first non-''neoformans Cyrptococcus'' to infect a human. It was isolated from ventricular fluid from a patient who had a neurosurgical procedure. This species was found to be very sensitive to amphotericin B at the minimum inhibitory dose. This species was first isolated from a human nail.
