A '''cough''' ({{audio|En-us-cough.ogg|pronunciation}} [[Latin]]: '''tussis'''), is a sudden and often repetitively occurring reflex which helps to clear the large breathing passages from secretions, irritants, foreign particles and [[microbes]]. The [[cough reflex]] consists of three phases: an [[inhalation]], a forced [[exhalation]] against a closed [[glottis]], and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.<ref name="Lancet-causes">{{cite journal |author=Chung KF, Pavord ID |title=Prevalence, pathogenesis, and causes of chronic cough |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9621 |pages=1364–74 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18424325 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60595-4 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(08)60595-4}}</ref> Coughing can happen voluntarily as well as involuntarily.

Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many [[virus]]es and [[bacteria]] benefit evolutionarily by causing the [[Host (biology)|host]] to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Most of the time, irregular coughing is caused by a [[respiratory tract infection]] but can be triggered by choking, [[smoking]], [[air pollution]],<ref name="Lancet-causes"/> [[asthma]], [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], [[post-nasal drip]], [[chronic bronchitis]], lung tumors, [[heart failure]] and medications such as [[ACE inhibitor]]s.

Treatment should target the cause; for example, [[smoking cessation]] or discontinuing ACE inhibitors. Some people may be worried about serious illnesses, and reassurance may suffice. [[Cough suppressant]]s such as [[codeine]] or [[dextromethorphan]] are frequently prescribed, but have been demonstrated to have little effect. Other treatment options may target airway [[inflammation]] or may promote [[Sputum | mucus expectoration]]. As it is a natural protective reflex, suppressing the cough reflex might have damaging effects, especially if the cough is productive.<ref name="pmid18424326">{{cite journal |author=Pavord ID, Chung KF |title=Management of chronic cough |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9621 |pages=1375–84 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18424326 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60596-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(08)60596-6}}</ref>

==Classification==
A cough can be classified by its duration, character, quality, and timing.<ref name=Review10/> The duration can be either [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] (of sudden onset) if it is present less than three weeks, [[subacute]] if it is present between three and eight weeks, and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] when lasting longer than eight weeks.<ref name=Review10/> A cough can be non-productive (dry) or productive (when [[sputum]] is coughed up). It may occur only at night (then called ''nocturnal cough''), during both night and day, or just during the day.<ref name=Review10/>

A number of characteristic coughs exist. While these have not been found to be diagnostically useful in adults, they are of use in children.<ref name=Review10/> A barky cough is part of the common presentation of [[croup]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bjornson CL, Johnson DW |title=Croup in the paediatric emergency department |journal=Paediatr Child Health |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=473–477 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=19030411 |pmc=2528757 |doi= |url=}}</ref> while a staccato cough has been classically described with [[Chlamydia trachomatis|chlamydia]] [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller KE |title=Diagnosis and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=73 |issue=8 |pages=1411–6 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16669564 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
A cough in children may be either a normal physiological reflex or due to an underlying cause.<ref name=Review10/> In healthy children it may be normal in the absence of any disease to cough ten times a day.<ref name=Review10/> The most common cause of an acute or subacute cough is a viral [[respiratory tract infection]].<ref name=Review10/> In adults with a chronic cough, i.e. a cough longer than 8 weeks, more than 90% of cases are due to [[post-nasal drip]], [[asthma]], [[eosinophilic bronchitis]], and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].<ref name=Review10/> The causes of chronic cough are similar in children with the addition of [[bronchitis|bacterial bronchitis]].<ref name=Review10/>

===Infections===
A cough can be the result of a [[respiratory tract infections|respiratory tract infection]] such as the [[common cold]], [[pneumonia]], [[pertussis]], or [[tuberculosis]]. In the vast majority of cases, acute coughs, i.e. coughs shorter than 3 weeks, are due to the common cold.<ref name="pmid20015366">{{cite journal |author=Dicpinigaitis PV, Colice GL, Goolsby MJ, Rogg GI, Spector SL, Winther B |title=Acute cough: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge |journal=Cough |volume=5 |issue= |pages=11 |year=2009 |pmid=20015366 |pmc=2802352 |doi=10.1186/1745-9974-5-11 |accessdate=2010-07-09 |quote= In the vast majority of cases, acute cough is due to acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), i.e., the common cold. |postscript=}}</ref> In people with a normal chest X-ray, tuberculosis is a rare finding. [[Pertussis]] is increasingly being recognised as a cause of troublesome coughing in adults.

After a viral infection has cleared, the person may be left with a [[post-viral cough|postinfectious cough]]. This typically is a dry, non-productive cough that produces no [[phlegm]]. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, and a tickle in the lungs. This cough may often persist for weeks after an illness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The cause of the cough may be inflammation similar to that observed in repetitive stress disorders such as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]. The repetition of coughing produces inflammation which produces discomfort, which in turn produces more coughing creating a closed loop.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Postinfectious cough typically does not respond to conventional cough treatments. Treatment consists of any anti-inflammatory medicine to treat the inflammation, and a cough suppressant to reduce frequency of the cough until inflammation clears.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Inflammation may increase sensitivity to other existing issues such as allergies, and treatment of other causes of coughs (such as use of an air purifier or allergy medicines) may help speed recovery. A bronchodilator, which helps open up the airways, may also help treat this type of cough.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Reactive airway disease===
When coughing is the only complaint of a person who meets the criteria for asthma ([[bronchial hyperresponsiveness]] and reversibility), this is termed cough-variant asthma. Two related conditions are atopic cough and eosinophilic bronchitis. Atopic cough occurs in individuals with a [[family history]] of [[atopy]], abundant [[eosinophils]] in the sputum, but with normal airway function and responsiveness. Eosinophilic bronchitis is also characterized by [[eosinophils]] in the sputum, without airway hyperresponsiveness or an atopic background. This condition responds to treatment with [[corticosteroids]]. Cough can also worsen in an [[acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].

Asthma is a common cause of chronic cough in adults and children. Coughing may be the only symptom the person has from their asthma, or asthma symptoms may also include wheezing, shortness of breath, and a tight feeling in their chest. Depending on how severe the asthma is it can be treated with bronchodilators (medicine which causes the airways to open up) or inhaled steroids. Treatment of the asthma should make the cough go away.

[[Chronic bronchitis]] is defined clinically as a persistent cough that produces sputum (phlegm) and mucus, for at least three months in two consecutive years. Chronic bronchitis is often the cause of “smoker’s cough.” The tobacco causes inflammation, secretion of mucus into the airway, and difficulty clearing that mucus out of the airways. Coughing helps clear those secretions out. May be treated by quitting smoking. May also be caused by Pneumoconiosis and long-term fume inhalation.

===Gastroesophageal reflux===
In people with unexplained cough, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] should be considered.<ref name=Review10/> This occurs when acidic contents of the stomach come back up into the esophagus. Symptoms usually associated with [[GERD]] include heartburn, sour taste in the mouth, or a feeling of acid reflux in the chest, although, more than half of the people with cough from GERD don’t have any other symptoms. An esophageal pH monitor can confirm the diagnosis of GERD. Sometimes GERD can complicate respiratory ailments related to cough, such as asthma or bronchitis. The treatment involves anti-acid medications and lifestyle changes with surgery indicated in cases not manageable with conservative measures.

===Air pollution===
Coughing may be caused by [[air pollution]] including [[tobacco smoke]], particulate matter, irritant gases, and dampness in a home.<ref name=Review10/>
The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.  Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, the individual's health status and genetics.  People who exercise outdoors on hot, smoggy days, for example, increase their exposure to pollutants in the air.

===Foreign body===
A [[foreign body]] can sometimes be suspected, for example if the cough started suddenly when the patient was eating. Rarely, sutures left behind inside the airway branches can cause coughing. A cough can be triggered by dryness from [[mouth breathing]] or recurrent aspiration of food into the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]] in people with [[dysphagia|swallowing difficulties]].

===ACE inhibitor===
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are drugs used in diabetics, heart disease, and high blood pressure. In 10-25%{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} of the people who take it, it can cause them to have a cough as a side effect. Cessation of ACE Inhibitor use is the only way to stop the cough. Such medicines for hypertension are very common in use such as [[ramipril]] and [[quinapril]]. There are cases of "cough of unknown origin" who had resolution with stopping the drug.<ref> Kostas Koliopoulos, Cardiologist: "Cases of Cough of unknown origin, due to use of ACE medication for hypertension", data on file, Preveza, Greece, 2010</ref>

===Psychogenic cough===
A [[psychogenic cough]] ("[[habit cough]]" or "tic cough") may be the cause in the absence of a physical problem. In these instances, emotional and psychological problems are suspected. However, other illnesses have to be ruled out before a firm diagnosis of psychogenic cough is made. Psychogenic cough is thought to be more common in children than in adults. A possible scenario: psychogenic cough develops in a child who has a chronically ill brother or sister.<ref name="pmid16428707">{{cite journal |author=Irwin RS, Glomb WB, Chang AB |title=Habit cough, tic cough, and psychogenic cough in adult and pediatric populations: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines |journal=Chest |volume=129 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=174S–179S |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16428707 |doi=10.1378/chest.129.1_suppl.174S |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16428707}}</ref>

===Other===
Cough may also be caused by conditions affecting the lung tissue such as [[bronchiectasis]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[interstitial lung disease]]s and [[sarcoidosis]]. Coughing can also be triggered by [[benign]] or [[lung cancer|malignant lung tumor]]s or mediastinal masses. Through irritation of the nerve, diseases of the external auditory canal (wax, for example) can also cause cough. Cardiovascular diseases associated with cough are heart failure, pulmonary infarction and aortic aneurysm. Nocturnal cough is associated with heart failure, as the heart does not compensate for the increased volume shift to the pulmonary circulation, in turn causing [[pulmonary edema]] and resultant cough.<ref name=Farzan>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=cm&part=A1188 NCBI  » Bookshelf  » Clinical Methods  » The Pulmonary System » Cough and Sputum Production] By Sattar Farzan.

Boston: Butterworths; 1990. ISBN 0-409-90077-X</ref> Other causes of nocturnal cough include [[asthma]], [[post-nasal drip]] and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD).<ref>http://www.nlhep.org/books/pul_Pre/chronic-cough.html National Lung Health Education Program > C. Chronic Cough] The Snowdrift Pulmonary Foundation, Inc. 2000. ISBN 0-9671809-2-9</ref> Another cause of cough occurring preferentially in [[supine position]] is recurrent aspiration.<ref name=Farzan/>

Coughing may also be used for social reasons, such as the coughing before giving a speech. Cough may also be psychogenic, which is different from habit coughing and tic coughing.<ref name="pmid16428707">{{cite journal |author=Irwin RS, Glomb WB, Chang AB |title=Habit cough, tic cough, and psychogenic cough in adult and pediatric populations: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines |journal=Chest |volume=129 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=174S–179S |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16428707 |doi=10.1378/chest.129.1_suppl.174S |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16428707}}</ref> Coughing may occur in [[tic disorder]]s such as [[Tourette syndrome]], although it should be distinguished from throat-clearing in this disorder.

Given its irritant nature to mammal tissues, [[capsaicin]] is widely used to determine the cough threshold and as a tussive stimulant in clinical research of cough suppressants. Capsaicin is what makes [[chili pepper]]s spicy, and might explain why workers in factories with these vegetables can develop a cough.

Coughing is not always involuntary, and can be used in social situations. Coughing can be used to attract attention, release internal psychological tension, or become a maladaptive displacement behavior. It is believed that the frequency of such coughing increases in environments vulnerable to psychological tension and social conflict. In such environments, coughing may become one of many [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] behaviors and/or [[defense mechanism]]s. Coughs can be a symptom to the [[common cold]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:CoughsAndSneezesSpreadDiseases.jpg|thumb|Coughing is viewed as a public health issue.]]
A cough is a protective [[reflex]] in healthy individuals which is influenced by [[psychological]] factors.<ref name=Review10/> The cough reflex is initiated by stimulation of two different classes of [[afferent nerve]]s, namely the [[myelin]]ated rapidly adapting receptors, and nonmyelinated [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]] with endings in the [[lung]]s. However it is not certain that the stimulation of nonmyelinated [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]] leads to cough with a [[reflex]] as it's meant in [[physiology]] (with its own five components): this stimulation may cause [[mast cell]]s [[degranulation]] (through an asso-assonic reflex) and [[edema]] which may work as a stimulus for rapidly adapting receptors.

==Diagnostic approach==
The determination of the cause of a cough usually begins by determining if it is specific or nonspecific in nature.<ref name=Review10/> A specific cough is one associated with other symptoms and further workup is dependent on these symptoms while a non specific cough occurs without other signs and symptoms.<ref name=Review10/> Further workup may include labs, [[x rays]], and [[spirometry]].<ref name=Review10/>

==Treatment==
The treatment of a cough in children is based on the underlying cause with the use of [[cough medicine]] supported by little evidence and thus not recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref name=Review10/>

A trial of [[antibiotics]] or [[inhaled corticosteroid]]s may be tried in children with a chronic cough in an attempt to treat [[protracted bacterial bronchitis]] or [[asthma]] respectively.<ref name=Review10/>

==Complications==
The complications of coughing can be classified as either [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] or [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]]. Acute complications include cough syncope ([[fainting]] spells due to decreased blood flow to the brain when coughs are prolonged and forceful), [[insomnia]], cough-induced [[vomiting]], rupture of [[bleb (medicine)|bleb]]s causing [[Pneumothorax#Spontaneous|spontaneous pneumothorax]] (although this still remains to be proven), [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]] or "[[red eye (medicine)|red eye]]", coughing [[defecation]] and in women with a [[prolapse]]d [[uterus]], cough [[urination]].  Chronic complications are common and include abdominal or pelvic [[hernia]]s, fatigue [[fracture]]s of lower ribs and [[costochondritis]].

==Epidemiology==
A cough is the most common reason for visiting a [[primary care physician]] in the United States.<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal |author=Goldsobel AB, Chipps BE |title=Cough in the pediatric population |journal=J.
