At the [[base of the skull]] the '''foramen ovale''' (Latin: oval window) is one of the larger of the several holes (the [[Foramina of the skull|foramina]]) that transmit nerves through the skull. The foramen ovale is situated in the posterior part of the [[sphenoid bone]], posterolateral to the [[foramen rotundum]].

==Contents==

Several nerves, arteries and veins pass through the foramen ovale. They are as follows: 

* [[Mandibular nerve]] (the third branch (V<sub>3</sub>) of the [[trigeminal nerve]])
* [[Accessory meningeal artery]] (small meningeal or parvidural branch, sometimes derived from the [[middle meningeal artery]])
* [[Lesser petrosal nerve]] of (CN IX) (note: the lesser superficial petrosal nerve sometimes passes through a special canal ([[Foramen petrosum|''canaliculus innominatus'' of Arnold]]), situated medial to the [[foramen spinosum]])
* [[Emissary veins]] (from the [[cavernous sinus]] to the [[pterygoid plexus]])

* The [[otic ganglion]] is situated directly under the foramen, but is also transmitted through the foramen ovale.

The contents of this foramen neatly form the mnemonic 'OVALE' (otic ganglion, V<sub>3</sub>, accessory meningeal artery, lesser petrosal nerve, emissary veins)

==Morphology and morphometry==

Similar to other foramina, the foramen ovale differs in shape and size throughout the natural life. The earliest perfect ring-shaped formation of the foramen ovale was observed in the 7th fetal month and the latest in 3 years after birth, in a study using over 350 skulls.<!--

The borders of the foramen in some skulls were also irregular and rough. This may suggest, based on radiological images, the presence of morbid changes, which might be the sole anatomical variation in the foramina ovale of humans. (Reymond et al.)<!--

In newborn, the foramen ovale is about 3.85&nbsp;mm and in the adults about 7.2&nbsp;mm in length. The average maximal length is about 7.48&nbsp;mm and its average minimal length is 4.17&nbsp;mm in the adult. The width extends from 1.81&nbsp;mm in the newborn to 3.7&nbsp;mm in adults.<ref name="Yanagi" /> <!--
