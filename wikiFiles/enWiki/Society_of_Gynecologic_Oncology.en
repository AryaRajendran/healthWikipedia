==History==
The idea for a national [[medical association]] dedicated to the study and treatment of gynecologic cancer originated in February 1968 during a discussion between Drs. Hervy E. Averette and John J. Mikuta at a meeting of the [[Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].  Over time, a growing number of physicians signed on to the idea, and the society was formally founded at a meeting held in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]] in January 1969 under the chairmanship of George C. Lewis, Jr., MD.<ref>{{cite web
