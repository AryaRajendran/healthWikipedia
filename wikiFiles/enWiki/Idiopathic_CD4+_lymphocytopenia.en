'''Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia''' ('''ICL''') is a [[rare disease|very rare]] medical [[syndrome]] in which the body has too few [[CD4]]<sup>+</sup> [[T lymphocytes]], which are a kind of [[white blood cell]].<ref name="pmid16763460">{{cite journal

==Cause==
The cause of ICL, like all [[idiopathic]] conditions, is unknown.  It does not appear to be caused by a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] agent, such as a [[virus]].<ref>[http://www.online-medical-dictionary.org/T-Lymphocytopenia,+CD4+.asp?q=T-Lymphocytopenia%2C+CD4%2B Online Medical Dictionary entry on T-lymphocytopenia]</ref>   It is widely believed that there is more than one cause.<ref name="pmid8093636">{{cite journal

==Diagnosis==
The mandatory criteria for diagnosis of idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia include:<ref>UpToDate article on "Techniques and interpretation of measurement of the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected patients", by John G. Bartlett. Accessed 30 Oct 2006.</ref>
*Low numbers of CD4+ cells, on two or more measurements over at least six weeks:
**CD4 cell count less than 300 cells per [[microliter]], or
**Less than 20% of T lymphocytes are CD4+
*Lack of laboratory evidence of HIV infection
*Absence of any alternative explanation for the CD4 [[lymphocytopenia]]

A one-time finding of low CD4+ cells is usually associated with a recent infection and resolves on its own.<ref name="pmid8609222" /> Alternative explanations for the low CD4 counts include conditions such as [[blood cancer]]s ([[aleukemia]]), treatment with [[chemotherapy]], [[immunosuppressive]] medications, or other medications that suppress or kill [[T cell]]s, infections, and problems with [[hematopoesis|blood production]].<ref name="pmid16763460" /><ref name="pmid11926631">{{cite journal

|pmid=11926631

}}</ref>

All criteria must be fulfilled for a diagnosis of ICL.  Additionally, if these findings are present, but combined with other significant findings, such as [[anemia]] or [[thrombocytopenia]], then other diagnoses must be considered.

==Pathophyisology==
The loss of CD4+ T cells appears to be through [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid16009850" /><ref name="pmid8609222">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  The accelerated deaths of the T cells is likely driven by crosslinking T cell receptors.<ref name="pmid8609222" />

==Treatment==
[[Fludarabine]]-based [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) has shown to be a feasible treatment for ICL.<ref>{{cite pmid|23581828|noedit}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
In contrast to the CD4<sup>+</sup> cell depletion caused by HIV, patients with idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia generally have a good [[prognosis]].<ref name="pmid8093636" /><ref>{{cite journal

ICL may indirectly trigger autoimmune diseases.  It has been associated with several cases of autoimmune disease [[Sjogren's syndrome]].<ref name="pmid16009850" /><ref name="pmid15088298">{{cite journal

Because all of the reported autoimmune diseases and lymphomas involve [[B cell]]s, one hypothesis proposes that ICL's narrow T cell repertoire predisposes the immune system to B cell disorders.<ref name="pmid16009850" />

==Epidemiology==
ICL is a very [[rare disease]].<ref name="pmid16763460" />  In 1993, a total of 47 confirmed cases were reported in a survey sponsored by the [[Centers for Disease Control]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Smith D, Neal J, Holmberg S | title = Unexplained opportunistic infections and CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia without HIV infection.
