A '''health insurance cooperative''' is a [[cooperative]] entity that has the goal of providing  [[health insurance]] and is also owned by the people that the organization insures.<ref>[http://patients.about.com/od/healthcarereform/f/healthinsurancecoops.htm "What Is a Health Insurance Co-op? (Health Insurance Cooperative)" About.com: Patient Empowerment] Retrieved on August 17, 2009</ref> It is a form of [[mutual insurance]].

In the debate over [[healthcare reform]], health care cooperatives are posited as an alternative to both [[publicly funded health care]] and [[single-payer health care]]. 

It has been proposed as part of the [[health care reform debate in the United States]] by the [[Barack Obama administration]] as a possible compromise with [[Blue Dog Democrats]] (as well as with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]) in the search for [[universal health care]] in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090816/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_health_care_overhaul "White House appears ready to drop 'public option'"] Retrieved on August 17, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/health/policy/17talkshows.html?_r=1&hp "White House Appears Open to Insurance Co-ops" New York Times] Retrieved on August 17, 2009</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125043830465934883.html?mod=rss_Today's_Most_Popular "Chances Dim for a Public Plan" The Wall Street Journal] Retrieved on August 18, 2009</ref>
As it is being proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and others, a future health insurance cooperative would not be government owned or run, but would instead receive an initial government investment and would then be operated as a [[non-profit organization]].<ref>[http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/53362687.html "President Obama Considering Insurance Co-Op" KKTV.com] Retrieved on August 17, 2009</ref>

While a health insurance co-op is not strictly run by the government, hence not making it a public entity, it has been described by Senator [[Max Baucus]] of [[Montana]], who is also the chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]] as "tough enough to keep insurance companies’ feet to the fire."<ref>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/co-op-health-plan-emerging-as-a-senate-option/ "Co-op Health Plan Emerging as a Senate Option" New York Times] Retrieved on August 17, 2009</ref> He has proposed a bill that includes a health insurance cooperative instead of the [[public option]].<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2228582/ "Zen Health Reform" - Slate.com] Retrieved September 18, 2009</ref>

There once were numerous rural health cooperatives established by the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA). Most of them closed or merged over the years, generally because they lacked a sufficient [[economy of scale]] (i.e., they were too small to function efficiently). Thus, co-operatives currently have so little [[market share]] as to be "invisible".<ref>Michael R. Grey. [[New Deal]] Medicine: The Rural Health Programs of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. 1999.</ref> <!-- (broken link) In contrast, the currently proposed co-ops would likely be statewide.<ref name="Herald">[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/1190956.html Are health care co-ops the answer for reforming the system? - Miami Herald]</ref> -->

The bill proposed by [[Max Baucus]], the [[America’s Healthy Future Act]], which uses health insurance cooperatives, was estimated by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to cost $829 billion over ten years, and because of the increase in taxes of $210 billion over 10 years<ref>The Atlantic, [http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/baucuscare_score.php "New CBO Score Of Baucus Bill"] 07 Oct 2009</ref> on premium insurance plans with high benefits, would lead to a reduction in the deficit of $81 billion.<ref>[http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/10/the_baucus_bill_cuts_the_deficit.php "The Baucus Bill Cuts The Deficit" - theAtlantic.com] Retrieved October 7, 2009</ref>  It would expand coverage to 94 percent of all eligible Americans.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_health_care_overhaul "Health bill would cost $829B, help cover 94 pct" - Yahoo!

=== Support ===
During a September 2009 report by [[John King (journalist)|John King]] of [[CNN]], he stated that "supporters know, here in Minnesota and other farm states think co-ops could solve at least a big chunk of the health care access and affordability problem." He interviewed Bill Oemichen, President of the Cooperative Network, who remarked that "where co-ops are, they tend to be very, very high quality because it is the consumer who owns them, that is making sure that their health care provider is a quality health care provider." Oemichen also stated that 65% of those who switched from typical health insurance reported better coverage and service.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0909/06/sotu.01.html|publisher=[[State of the Union with John King]]|date=September 6, 2009|author=[[John King (journalist)|John King]]|accessdate=September 21, 2009|title=Interview With Senators Klobuchar, Nelson; Interview With Governor Pawlenty}}</ref>

In June 2009, Republican Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] told reporters, "if it’s all done entirely within the private sector, you know, it doesn’t seem to me it’s got the faults that you have... by having the government institute something."<ref name=Boston/> Steven Hill, a program director at the [[New America Foundation]], has written for [[Salon.com]] that "co-ops may hold the key to a substantive compromise", comparing the U.S. reform proposals with [[health care in Germany]]. He argued that they can produce quality care for less money given that they would lack the [[profit motive]], they would negotiate fees for service, and that they would end current [[market monopolies]] that insurance companies have in several states.<ref>http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/10/12/cooperatives/index.html</ref>

=== Criticism ===
[[Howard Dean]] and other Democrats have criticized abandoning the idea of a federally run, statewide, public option in favor of co-ops, questioning whether the co-ops would have enough negotiating power to compete with private health insurers.<ref name=Boston>{{citenews|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/06/21/healthcare_debate_shifting_to_public_vs_private/?page=full|accessdate=September 21, 2009|title=Health debate shifting to public vs. private|publisher=''[[Boston Globe]]''|date=June 21, 2009|first=Lisa|last=Wangsness}}</ref> The activist groups [[SEIU]] and [[MoveOn.org]] have also stated their opposition.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Prominent economists such as 2008 Nobel Economics Laureate [[Paul Krugman]] and [[Robert Reich]] have also questioned co-ops' ability to become large enough to reduce health care costs significantly. Thus, they both support the [[public option]] instead, which they state has strong opposition from the insurance industry.<ref>[http://robertreich.blogspot.com/search?q=cooperatives Robert Reich's recent references to health insurance cooperatives]</ref><ref>{{citenews|author=[[Paul Krugman]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/opinion/18krugman.html?_r=2&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Baucus and the Threshold|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=September 17, 2009|accessdate=September 21, 2009}}</ref>
