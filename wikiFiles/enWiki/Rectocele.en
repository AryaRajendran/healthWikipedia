A '''rectocele''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|ɛ|k|t|ə|s|iː|l}} {{respell|REK|tə-seel}}) results from a tear in the [[rectovaginal septum]] (which is normally a tough, fibrous, sheet-like divider between the [[rectum]] and [[vagina]]).  Rectal tissue bulges through this tear and into the vagina as a hernia.   There are two main causes of this tear: childbirth, and [[hysterectomy]].

Although the term applies most usually to the phenomenon of rectal herniation into the vagina in females, males may suffer with a condition likewise named. Rectoceles in men are uncommon, and usually the protrusion is backwards rather than forwards, as the [[prostate gland]] provides structural support anteriorly in men. [[Prostatectomy]] appears to be associated with rectoceles in men. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=HH|coauthors=Iroatulam, A; Alabaz, O; Weiss, EG; Nogueras, JJ; Wexner, SD|title=Associations of defecography and physiologic findings in male patients with rectocele.|journal=Techniques in coloproctology|date=2001 Dec|volume=5|issue=3|pages=157–61|pmid=11875683}}</ref> 

==Symptoms==
Mild cases may simply produce a sense of pressure or protrusion within the vagina, and the occasional feeling that the rectum has not been completely emptied after a bowel movement.  Moderate cases may involve difficulty passing [[feces|stool]] (because the attempt to evacuate pushes the stool into the rectocele instead of out through the [[anus]]), discomfort or pain during evacuation or intercourse, [[constipation]], and a general sensation that something is "falling down" or "falling out" within the [[pelvis]].  Severe cases may cause vaginal bleeding, intermittent [[fecal incontinence]], or even the [[prolapse]] of the bulge through the mouth of the vagina, or [[rectal prolapse]] through the anus. Digital evacuation, or, manual pushing, on the posterior wall of the vagina helps to aid in bowel movement in a majority of cases of rectocele. Rectocele can be a cause of symptoms of [[obstructed defecation]]. <ref name=Coloproctology>{{cite book|last=Wexner|first=edited by Andrew P. Zbar, Steven D.|title=Coloproctology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84882-755-4}}</ref>

==Causes==
It can be caused by many factors, but the most common is childbirth, especially with babies over nine pounds in weight, or rapid births.  The use of [[forceps]] is more likely a marker for the vaginal injury, than a direct cause of the tear.  Episiotomy or lower vaginal tears play little role in the formation of a [[cystocele]], but may in rectoceles.  The risk increases with the number of vaginal births, although it can also happen in women who have never borne a child.  

A [[hysterectomy]] or other pelvic surgery can be a cause,<ref name="titleRectocele: Risk factors - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/rectocele/DS00704/DSECTION=4 |title=Rectocele: Risk factors - MayoClinic.com |accessdate=2007-11-21 |format= |work=}}</ref> as can chronic constipation and straining to pass bowel movements.  It is more common in older women than in younger ones; [[estrogen]] which helps to keep the pelvic tissues elastic decreases after [[menopause]].  Another cause which is sometimes overlooked in younger women is [[sexual abuse]] during childhood.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the severity of the problem, and may include changes in diet (increase in fiber and water intake), [[pelvic floor]] exercises such as [[Kegel exercise]]s, use of [[stool softener]]s, [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] for post-menopausal women, insertion of a [[pessary]] into the vagina, and various forms of [[surgery]]<ref name="pmid17132479">{{cite journal |author=Paraiso MF, Barber MD, Muir TW, Walters MD |title=Rectocele repair: a randomized trial of three surgical techniques including graft augmentation |journal=Am.

More recent developments in surgery are directed at repairs to the [[rectovaginal septum]], than simple excision or plication of vaginal skin, which provides no support. Both [[gynecologist]]s and colorectal [[surgeon]]s can address this problem.
