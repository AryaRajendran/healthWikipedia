'''William Worrall Mayo, M.D.''' (May 31, 1819 &ndash; March 6, 1911) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] [[medical doctor]] and [[chemist]], best known for establishing the private medical practice that later evolved into the [[Mayo Clinic]]. He was a descendant of a famous English chemist, [[John Mayow]]. His sons, [[William James Mayo]] and [[Charles Horace Mayo]], established a joint medical practice in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Minnesota]] in the 1880s.

==Early life==
Dr. William Worall Mayo was born in [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], near [[Salford, Greater Manchester]], [[England]] and studied science and medicine in [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]], and [[London]] before leaving for the U.S. in 1845. His first work in his new country was as a [[pharmacist]] at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]], though he soon moved westward.

Mayo spent a brief period of time in [[Buffalo, New York]] before settling in [[Lafayette, Indiana]] where he worked as a [[tailor]] (one of the vocations he had while in England).  He returned to medicine in 1849, assisting in a [[cholera]] outbreak and then attending courses at Indiana Medical College in [[La Porte, Indiana]] where he earned his medical degree. Although the training there would probably be considered mediocre by modern standards, the school did have a [[microscope]], an uncommon tool at the time. Knowledge of how to use this instrument proved to be useful in Mayo's future practice. He received his M.D. degree on February 14, 1850.

==Migrating west==
In 1851, Mayo married Louise Abigail Wright (December 23, 1825â€“July 15, 1915), and two years later, they had their first child, Gertrude.  Around this time, Mayo left for a winter to work as an assistant at the [[University of Missouri]]'s medical department. He returned in 1854, but contracted [[malaria]] and decided to leave the Lafayette area, saying, "I'm going to keep on driving until I get well or die."  Mayo found his way to [[Minnesota]], which he supposedly thought would have a more healthful climate.  However, whether that explanation is actually true is questionable. He settled in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], but returned to Indiana a short time later to bring his family to the Minnesota territory.  Mayo then found his way to the present-day area of [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] where he worked as a [[census]]-taker.

He brought his family to a village named Cronan's Precinct (near [[Le Sueur, Minnesota|Le Sueur]]) along the [[Minnesota River]] where he became known as the "Little Doctor" because of his {{convert|5|ft|4|in|m|adj=on}} stature. Mayo tried his hand at a number of different activities including [[farming]], operating a [[ferry]] service, and serving as a [[judge]] in addition to occasional medical duties. By this time, he had two more daughters in his family, Phoebe and Sarah.

After a flood in 1859, the family moved to [[Dr. William W. Mayo House|a home]] on Main Street in [[Le Sueur, Minnesota|Le Sueur]]. There, he set up his first official medical practice, but the flow of patients was too meager to support the family. Mayo took to publishing a short-lived [[newspaper]], the ''Le Sueur Courier'', which only lasted about three months.  He also spent time working on a [[steamboat]]. The family saw its first male addition, [[William James Mayo]], in 1861.

As the [[American Civil War]] began that same year, Mayo attempted to procure a commission as a military surgeon, but was rejected. Nonetheless, he found his way into military medicine as the [[Dakota War of 1862]] erupted in southwest [[Minnesota]] in late 1862. Organizing a group of people from Le Sueur and [[St. Peter, Minnesota|St. Peter]], he headed out to [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]], where some of the worst fighting had occurred. Makeshift hospitals in the city cared for people injured in the conflict, as well as [[refugee]]s driven from farms in the area. His wife opened her home and a nearby [[Barn (building)|barn]] to harbor eleven refugee families back in Le Sueur.

==Rochester==
In 1863, Mayo finally was engaged as a military surgeon for the [[Conscription|draft]] board in Rochester, Minnesota.  He left his family for that position and soon found the new city to his liking, so they joined him there in early 1864. A year later, his son [[Charles Horace Mayo]] was born.

William W. Mayo opened a medical practice in Rochester, also spending time as a city [[mayor]], [[alderman]], and member of the [[school board]]. He also served in the [[Minnesota State Senate]] 1891-1895.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail.asp?ID=13927 |title=Minnesota Legislators Past & Present - Legislator Record - Mayo, William Worrall |publisher=Leg.state.mn.us |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> Here, the number of patients was large enough to support the family with no need for him to assume additional jobs.  Mayo spent some time in [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]] in 1869 studying surgical techniques.

The event that is usually credited with beginning the "Mayo Clinic Story" happened in 1883, when a [[tornado]] devastated Rochester. With the assistance of his sons, other regional doctors, and the local [[Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota]], William Mayo organized treatment of the injured. Mother [[Alfred Moes]] of the Sisters of St. Francis convinced him to help her establish a new hospital under her direction, forming [[St. Marys Hospital (Rochester)|St. Marys Hospital]] in 1889. At the time, only three people were on the surgical staff: William Worrall Mayo as chief, and his two sons as the other principal medical practitioners. No other doctors accepted invitations to join them at the time, perhaps because St. Marys was a Roman Catholic Hospital and anti-Catholic bias was rather common in central Minnesota during that period.

==Mayo Clinic==
In 1892, William Worrall Mayo asked Dr. [[Augustus Stinchfield]] to join his practice as a full partner. Once Stinchfield accepted the offer, W. W. Mayo promptly retired at age 73. As the practice grew, Drs. Christopher Graham, E. Starr Judd, [[Henry Stanley Plummer]], Melvin Millet, and Donald Balfour were also invited to join it as partners.  In 1919, the partners of the private practice created the Mayo Properties Association and established the Mayo Clinic as a not-for-profit entity.

In 1910, W. W. Mayo became interested in the extraction and distillation of alcohol from animal and vegetable wastes, and one day suffered a serious injury when the extraction mechanism crushed his arm and hand.  That injury necessitated an amputation and produced complications which resulted in his death in March 1911, shortly before Mayo's 92nd birthday. His wife died in 1915. They are buried next to each other at Oakwood Cemetery in Rochester.

The [[Dr. William W. Mayo House|family's home]] in Le Sueur was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969. Carson Nesbit Cosgrove and his family later lived in the home.  Cosgrove went on to help create the Minnesota Valley Canning Company, later named [[Green Giant]].

W. W. Mayo is honored together with [[Charles Frederick Menninger|Charles Menninger]] and their sons with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on March 6.
