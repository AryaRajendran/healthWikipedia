'''Lymphocytopenia''', or '''lymphopenia''', is the condition of having an abnormally low level of [[lymphocytes]] in the blood. [[Lymphocytes]] are a white blood cell with important functions in the immune system. The opposite is [[lymphocytosis]], which refers to an excessive level of lymphocytes.

Lymphocytopenia may be present as part of a [[pancytopenia]], when the total numbers of all types of blood cells are reduced.

==Classification==
In some cases, lymphocytopenia can be further classified according to which kind of lymphocytes are reduced.  If all three kinds of lymphocytes are suppressed, then the term is used without further qualification.

* In '''T lymphocytopenia''', there are too few [[T lymphocytes]], but normal numbers of other lymphocytes. It causes, and manifests as, a [[T cell deficiency]]. This is usually caused by [[HIV]] infection (resulting in [[AIDS]]), but may be [[Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia]] (ICL), which is a very rare heterogeneous disorder defined by CD4+ T-cell counts below 300 cells/muL in the absence of any known immune deficiency condition, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malaspina A, Moir S, Chaitt DG, ''et al'' |title=Idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia is associated with increases in immature/transitional B cells and serum levels of IL-7 |journal=Blood |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=2086–8 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17053062 |pmc=1801046 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-06-031385}}</ref>
* In '''B lymphocytopenia''', there are too few [[B lymphocytes]], but possibly normal numbers of other lymphocytes. It causes, and manifests as, a [[humoral immune deficiency]]. This is usually caused by [[medication]]s that suppress the immune system.
* In '''NK lymphocytopenia''', there are too few [[natural killer cells]], but normal numbers of other lymphocytes.  This is very rare.

==Causes==
The most common cause of temporary lymphocytopenia is a recent infection, such as the [[common cold]].  

Lymphocytopenia, but not idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia, is associated with [[corticosteroid]] use, infections with [[HIV]] and other [[virus|viral]], [[bacterial]], and [[fungal]] agents, [[malnutrition]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]],<ref name="">{{cite journal | author=W L Ng, C M Chu, A K L Wu, V C C Cheng, K Y Yuen | title=Lymphopenia at presentation is associated with increased risk of infections in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus | journal=Quarterly Journal of Medicine | volume= 99 | issue=1 | pages=37–47 | doi=10.1093/qjmed/hci155 | year=2005 | pmid=16371405}}</ref> severe [[stress (medicine)|stress]],<ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/blood_disorders/white_blood_cell_disorders/lymphocytopenia.html Lymphocytopenia] from the [[Merck Manual]] Home Health Handbook</ref> intense or prolonged [[physical exercise]] (due to [[cortisol]] release),<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Robson PJ, Blannin AK, Walsh NP, Castell LM, Gleeson M|year=1999|title=Effects of exercise intensity, duration and recovery on in vitro neutrophil function in male athletes|journal=International journal of sports medicine|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|volume=20|issue=2|pages=128–135|issn=0172-4622|pmid=10190775|last1=Robson|first1=PJ|doi=10.1055/s-2007-971106}}</ref>   [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[sarcoidosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hedfors E, Holm G, Pettersson D | title=Lymphocyte subpopulations in sarcoidosis | journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=219–26 | year=1974 | pmid=4549571 | pmc=1554022 }}</ref> and [[iatrogenic]] (caused by other medical treatments) conditions.

Lymphocytopenia is a frequent, temporary result from many types of [[chemotherapy]], such as with [[cytotoxic agent]]s or immunosuppressive drugs. Some malignancies that have spread to involve the [[bone marrow]], such as [[leukemia]] or advanced [[Hodgkin's]] disease,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1172/JCI108175|author=Faguet|title=Quantitation of immunocompetence in Hodgkin's disease | journal=J Clin Invest | year=1975 | volume=56 | issue=4 | pages=951–957|pmid=1159096|pmc=301951}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1002/cncr.2820360924| author=Weiss RB, Brunning RD, Kennedy BJ | title=Hodgkin's disease in the bone marrow | journal=Cancer | year=1975 | volume=36| issue=6| pages=2077–83| pmid=1203865}}</ref> also cause lymphocytopenia.

Large doses of [[radiation]], such as those involved with [[nuclear accidents]] or medical [[whole body radiation]], may cause lymphocytopenia.

==Diagnosis==
Lymphocytopenia is diagnosed from the results of a [[complete blood count]]. In adults, a lymphocyte level below 1,500 cells/microliter is diagnostic (proof of the condition), and in children, a lymphocyte level below 3,000 cells/microliter is diagnostic.

==Prognosis==
Lymphocytopenia that is caused by infections tends to resolve once the infection has cleared. Patients with idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia may have either abnormally low but stable CD4+ cell counts, or abnormally low and progressively falling CD4+ cell counts; the latter condition is terminal.

==Veterinary treatment==
Lymphocytopenia caused by [[Feline Leukemia Virus]] and [[Feline immunodeficiency virus]] [[retroviral]] infections is treated with [[Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator]]. <ref>http://tcyte.com/ltci-product-info-feline-leukemia/the-science-behind-the-product/</ref>
