In [[physiology]], '''perfusion''' is the process of delivery of [[blood]] to a [[capillary]] bed in the [[biological tissue]].  The word is derived from the French verb "perfuser" meaning to "pour over or through."

Tests of adequate perfusion are a part of the patient assessment process performed by [[medical]] or emergency personnel.  The most common methods include evaluating skin color, temperature, condition and capillary refill.

==Overperfusion and underperfusion==

The terms "overperfusion" and "underperfusion" are measured relative to the average level of perfusion across all tissues in an individual body, and the terms should not be confused with [[hypoperfusion]] and "hyperperfusion", which measure the perfusion level relative to the tissue's current need. 

Tissues like the [[heart]] are considered overperfused and receive more blood than would be expected to meet the metabolic needs of the tissue. In the case of the skin, extra blood flow is used for [[thermoregulation]].  In addition to delivering [[oxygen]], the blood helps [[Dissipation|dissipate]] heat by redirecting warm blood close to the surface where it can cool the body through [[sweating]] and [[thermal dissipation]].

==Discovery==
In 1920 [[August Krogh]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of the mechanism of regulation of the [[capillaries]] in [[skeletal muscle]]. Krogh was first to describe the adaptation of blood perfusion in muscle and other organs according to demands through opening and closing the [[arterioles]] and [[capillaries]].

==Measurement==
===Nuclear medicine===
Perfusion of various tissues can be readily measured [[in vivo]] with nuclear medicine methods, mainly [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT). Various radiopharmaceuticals targeted at specific organs are available, some of the most common being
* [[Technetium-99m|<sup>99m</sup>Tc]] labelled [[HMPAO]] and ECD for brain perfusion ([[Cerebral_blood_flow|rCBF]]) studied with SPECT
* [[Technetium-99m|<sup>99m</sup>Tc]] labelled [[Tetrofosmin]]  and [[Technetium_(99mTc)_sestamibi|Sestamibi]] for [[myocardial perfusion imaging|Myocardial_perfusion_imaging]] with SPECT
* [[Xe-133|<sup>133</sup>Xe]]-gas for absolute quantification of brain perfusion ([[Cerebral_blood_flow|rCBF]]) with SPECT
* [[Oxygen-15#Oxygen-15|<sup>15</sup>O]]-labeled water for brain perfusion ([[Cerebral_blood_flow|rCBF]]) with PET (absolute quantification possible when measuring arterial radioactivity concentration)
* [[Rubidium-82_chloride|<sup>82</sup>Rb-chloride]] for measuring myocardial perfusion with PET (absolute quantification is possible)

===MRI===
Two main categories of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) techniques can be used to measure tissue perfusion [[in vivo]].
* The first is based on the use of injected [[contrast agent]] that changes the [[magnetic susceptibility]] of blood and thereby the MR signal which is repeatedly measured during [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] passage.  
* The other category is based on [[arterial spin labelling]] (ASL), where arterial blood is [[magnet]]ically tagged before it enters into the tissue of interest and the amount of labelling is measured and compared to a control recording obtained without spin labelling.

===CT===
Brain perfusion (more correctly transit times) can be estimated with contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
