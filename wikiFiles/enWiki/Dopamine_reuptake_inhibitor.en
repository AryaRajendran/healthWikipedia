A '''dopamine reuptake inhibitor''' ('''DRI''', '''DARI''') is a type of [[drug]] that acts as a [[reuptake inhibitor]] for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]] by blocking the [[drug action|action]] of the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT). Reuptake inhibition is achieved when extracellular dopamine not absorbed by the post-synaptic neuron is blocked from re-entering the pre-synaptic neuron. This in turn leads to increased [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of dopamine and therefore an increase in [[dopaminergic]] [[neurotransmission]].<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Hai-Ying Zhang, Xia Li, Guo-Hua Bi, Eliot L. Gardner, Zheng-Xiong Xi|title=Increased vulnerability to cocaine in mice lacking dopamine D3 receptors|journal=PNAS|date=5|year=2012|month=9|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi10.1073/pnas.1205297109|author=Rui Song}}</ref>

DRIs are frequently used in the treatment of conditions like [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[narcolepsy]] on account of their [[psychostimulant]] effects and in the treatment of [[obesity]] due to their [[appetite suppressant]] properties. They have also been used as [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of [[mood disorder]]s, but their use for this indication has been limited on account of their [[abuse potential]] and [[controlled substance|legal restriction]]. Lack of Dopamine uptake and the increase in extracellular levels of dopamine have been linked to increased susceptibility to addictive behavior due to the increase in [[dopaminergic]] [[neurotransmission]]. The [[dopaminergic pathways]] are considered to be strong reward centers.  Additionally, many DRIs such as [[cocaine]] are [[drug abuse|drugs of abuse]] due to the [[reward system|rewarding]] effects evoked by elevated [[Synapse|synaptic]] concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[brain]].

Due to their strong [[reward system|rewarding]] and [[reinforcement|reinforcing]] properties, DRIs are notorious for their high [[drug abuse|abuse potential]] and liability to cause [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]]s, [[drug addiction|addiction]], and [[physical dependence|dependence]].{{Dubious|date=June 2010}} DRIs such as [[cocaine]] and [[methylphenidate]] and combination [[releasing agent]]s such as [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] ("ecstasy") are widely [[recreational drug use|used]] recreationally throughout the [[world]]. 

==Society and Culture==
===History of Use===
Until the 1950’s dopamine was thought to be nothing but part of the synthesis of [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]]. It was not until dopamine was found in the brain in same levels as norepinephrine that it was considered that dopamine might have a biological role other than the synthesis of the [[catecholamine|catecholamines]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|author=Jack R. Cooper|edition=7th|coauthors=Floyd E. Bloom, Robert H. Roth|page=293|chapter=9}}</ref>

==Pharmacotherapeutic Uses==
Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition is used as an antidepressant in the form of bupropion, the only [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (NDRI) approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Dopamine supplementation is also utilized as a means to counter act depression. Though no supplement exists that contains dopamine, certain supplements contain nutrients known to aid in dopamine production such as tyrosine, [[ginkgo biloba]], and certain B-vitamins.<ref>Stephen B. Dunnett; A. Bjorklund, T. Hokfelt (2005). Dopamine. Elsevier Science Ltd. pp. 588. ISBN 9780444517784.</ref>

DRIs have been explored as potential [[pharmacotherapy|pharmacotherapeutics]] because of their ability to replace rewards received from other drugs. DRIs have been successfully used to serve as [[nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacements]] in cases of smoking addictions well as [[methadone]] replacements in the case of heroin addiction. DRIs have been explored as potential substitutes for [[cocaine]] addiction, and have been shown to alleviate cravings and self-administration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=F.

Kuhar|title=Development of the Dopamine Transporter Selective RTI-336 as a Pharmacotherapy for Cocaine Abuse|journal=The AAPS Journal|date=24|year=2006|month=3|volume=8|series=1|url=http://www.aapsj.org|accessdate=11-12-2012}}</ref>

[[Monoamine reuptake inhibitor|Monoamine reuptake inhibitors]], including DRIs, have also been shown to be effective as therapy for food intake and appetite control for obese subjects. Most marketed drugs for this purpose have been withdrawn due to adverse side effects such as increase in blood pressure and high abuse potential.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kintscher|first=U|title=Reuptake Inhibitors of Dopamine, Noradrenaline, and Seratonin|journal=Handbook of Experimental Pharmocology|year=2012|volume=209|pages=339–347}}</ref>

===Bupropion===
Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that [[bupropion]] acts via dual inhibition of [[norepinephrine]] and [[Dopamine#Storage,_release,_and_reuptake|dopamine reuptake]], which constitutes a novel mechanism of antidepressant action. As such, bupropion is associated with a unique clinical profile with efficacy comparable to that of other [[antidepressants]]. Devoid of clinically significant [[serotonergic]] effects or direct effects on [[postsynaptic]] receptors, bupropion—the only currently available NDRI—is as effective as other antidepressants but does not cause common antidepressant-associated side effects such as sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sedation. Data supports the use of bupropion as a first-line antidepressant as well as its possible utility as augmentation therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=Stephen|coauthors=Pradko, James.

Note: Only DRIs selective for the DAT over the other [[monoamine transporter]]s (MATs) are listed here. For a list of DRIs that act at multiple MATs, see the other [[monoamine reuptake inhibitor]] pages such as [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|NDRI]] and [[serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|SNDRI]].

Additional note: [[Dopamine]] [[releasing agent]]s (DRAs) such as psychostimulants of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] class also act as DRIs secondarily to their releasing action. To distinguish between DRIs and DRAs however, the latter are not included in the above list. For a list of DRAs, see the [[releasing agent]] article.
