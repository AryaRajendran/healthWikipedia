Most cases of TTP arise from inhibition of the [[enzyme]] [[ADAMTS13]], a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving large multimers of [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF) into smaller units. A rarer form of TTP, called '''Upshaw-Schülman syndrome''', is genetically inherited as a dysfunction of ADAMTS13.  If large vWF multimers persist there is tendency for increased coagulation.<ref name=Moake2004>{{cite journal |author=Moake JL |title=von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS-13, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Semin. Hematol. |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=4–14 |year=2004 |pmid=14727254|doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2003.10.003}}</ref> 

Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to [[shear stress]] which damages their membranes, leading to intravascular [[hemolysis]] and [[schistocyte]] formation.  Reduced blood flow due to [[thrombosis]] and cellular injury results in [[end organ damage]]. Current therapy is based on support and [[plasmapheresis]] to reduce [[blood circulation|circulating]] antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of the enzyme.<ref name=Moake2004/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Classically, the following five features ("pentad") are indicative of TTP;<ref name=Amorosi>{{cite journal | author=Amorosi EL, Ultmann JE | title=Thrombocytopic purpura: report of 16 cases and review of the literature | journal=Medicine (Baltimore) | year=1966 | volume=45 | pages=139–159}}</ref> in most cases, some of these are absent.<ref name=Moake2002/> 
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (low [[platelet]] count), leading to [[bruising]] or [[purpura]]
* [[Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]] ([[anemia]], [[jaundice]] and a [[blood film]] featuring evidence of mechanical fragmentation of red blood cells)
* [[neurology|Neurologic]] symptoms (fluctuating), such as hallucinations, bizarre behavior, altered mental status, [[stroke]] or [[headache]]s
* [[Acute renal failure|Kidney failure]]
* [[Fever]]

The symptoms of TTP may at first be subtle, starting with [[malaise]], fever, headache and sometimes diarrhea. As the condition progresses clots (thrombi) form within blood vessels and platelets (clotting cells) are consumed. Bruising, and rarely bleeding, results and may be spontaneous. The bruising often takes the form of purpura while the most common site of bleeding, if it occurs, is from the nose or gums. Larger bruises ([[ecchymoses]]) may also develop.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Clots formed within the circulation can temporarily disrupt local blood supply. TTP preferentially affects the blood vessels of the brain and kidneys. Thus a patient may experience headache, confusion, difficulty speaking, transient paralysis, numbness or even fits whilst high blood pressure (hypertension) may be found on examination.<ref>{{cite web|author=Allford S, Machin S |title=Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/ttp.htm|work=NetDoctor.co.uk|year=2005}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
TTP is characterized by [[thrombotic microangiopathy]] (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. This characteristic is shared by two related syndromes, [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS) and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS).<ref>{{cite journal|last=George|first=JN|title=How I treat patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|journal=Blood|year=2010|volume=116|pages=4060–4069}}</ref> Consequently, differential diagnosis of these TMA-causing diseases is essential. In addition to TMA, one or more of the following symptoms may be present in each of these diseases: neurological symptoms (e.g. confusion,<ref name=Noris2010>{{cite journal|last=Noris, Caprioli, Bresin|first=M, J, E, et al.|title=Relative role of genetic complement abnormalities in sporadic and familial aHUS and their impact on clinical phenotype|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|year=2010|volume=5|pages=1844–1859}}</ref><ref name=Neuhaus1997>{{cite journal|last=Neuhaus, Calonder, Leumann|first=TJ, S, EP|title=Heterogeneity of atypical haemolytic uremic syndromes|journal=Arch Dis Child|year=1997|volume=76|pages=518–521}}</ref> cerebral convulsions<ref name=Neuhaus1997 /> seizures,<ref name=Dragon2012>{{cite journal|last=Dragon-Durey, Sethi, Bagga|first=M-A, SK, A, et al.|title=Clinical features of anti-factor H autoantibody-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=J Am Soc Nephrol|year=2010|volume=21|pages=2180–2187}}</ref>); renal impairment<ref name=Caprioli2006>{{cite journal|last=Caprioli, Noris, Brioschi|first=J, M, S et al.|title=Genetics of HUS: the impact of MCP, CFH, and IF mutations on clinical presentation, response to treatment, and outcome|journal=Blood|year=2006|volume=108|pages=1267–1279}}</ref> (e.g. elevated [[creatinine]],<ref name=Ariceta2009>{{cite journal|last=Ariceta, Besbas, Johnson|first=G, N, S, et al|title=Guideline for the investigation and initial therapy of diarrhea-negative hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Pediatr Nephrol|year=2009|volume=24|pages=687–696}}</ref> decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR],<ref name=Ariceta2009 /> abnormal urinalysis<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al-Akash, Almond, Savell, Gharaybeh, Hogue|first=SI, PS, VH Jr, SI, C|title=Eculizumab induces long-term remission in recurrent post-transplant HUS associated with C3 gene mutation|journal=Pediatr Nephrol|year=2011|volume=26|pages=613–619}}</ref>); and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (e.g. diarrhea<ref name=Noris2010 /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zuber, Le Quintrec, Sberro-Scussan, Loirat, Fremaux-Bacchi, Legendre|first=J, M, R, C, V, C|title=New insights into postrenal transplant hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Nat Rev Nephrol|year=2011|volume=7|pages=23–35}}</ref> nausea/vomiting,<ref name=Dragon2012 /> abdominal pain,<ref name=Dragon2012 /> gastroenteritis.<ref name=Noris2010 /><ref name=Caprioli2006 /> Unlike HUS and aHUS, TTP is known to be caused by an acquired defect in the [[ADAMTS13]] protein; a lab test showing ≤5% of normal ADAMTS13 levels is therefore indicative of TTP.<ref name=Tsai2010>{{cite journal|last=Tsai|first=H-M|title=Pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|journal=Int J Hematol|year=2010|volume=91|pages=1–19}}</ref> ADAMTS13 levels above 5%, coupled with a positive test for Shiga-toxin/enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), are more likely indicative of HUS,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bitzan, Schaefer, Raymond|first=M, F, D|title=Treatment of typical (enteropathic) hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Semin Thromb Hemostas|year=2010|volume=36|pages=594–610}}</ref> whereas absence of Shiga-toxin/EHEC can confirm a diagnosis of aHUS.<ref name=Tsai2010 />

==Causes and pathogenesis==
TTP, as with other [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]]s (MAHAs), is caused by spontaneous [[Platelet#Adhesion and aggregation|aggregation]] of [[platelet]]s and activation of [[coagulation]] in the small [[blood vessel]]s. Platelets are consumed in the coagulation process, and bind [[fibrin]], the end product of the coagulation pathway. These platelet-fibrin complexes form microthrombi which circulate in the vasculature and cause shearing of [[red blood cell]]s, resulting in [[hemolysis]].<ref name=Moake2002/>

Roughly, there are two forms of TTP: ''idiopathic'' and ''secondary'' TTP. A special case is the inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13, known as the ''Upshaw-Schülman syndrome''.<ref name=Moake2002/>

===Idiopathic TTP===
The ''[[idiopathic]]'' form of TTP was recently linked to the inhibition of the [[enzyme]] ADAMTS13 by [[antibody|antibodies]], rendering TTP an [[autoimmune disease]]. ADAMTS13 is a [[metalloproteinase]] responsible for the breakdown of [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF), a protein that links platelets, [[blood clot]]s, and the blood vessel wall in the process of blood [[coagulation]]. Very large vWF multimers are more prone to lead to coagulation. Hence, without proper cleavage of vWF by ADAMTS13, coagulation occurs at a higher rate, especially in the microvasculature, part of the blood vessel system where vWF is most active due to high [[shear stress]].<ref name=Moake2004/>

In idiopathic TTP, severely decreased (<5% of normal) ADAMTS13 activity can be detected in most (80%) patients, and inhibitors are often found in this subgroup (44-56%).  The relationship of reduced [[ADAMTS13]]  to the pathogenesis of TTP is known as the Furlan-Tsai hypothesis, after the two independent groups of researchers who published their research in the same issue of the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in 1998.<ref name="pmid9828253">{{cite journal |author=Moake JL |title=Moschcowitz, multimers, and metalloprotease |journal=N.

===Secondary TTP===
''Secondary TTP'' is diagnosed when the patient's history mentions one of the known features associated with TTP. It comprises about 40% of all cases of TTP. Predisposing factors are:<ref name=Moake2002/>
* [[Cancer]]
* [[Bone marrow transplantation]]
* [[Pregnancy]]
* [[Medication]] use:
** [[Quinine]]
** Platelet aggregation inhibitors ([[ticlopidine]], [[clopidogrel]], and [[prasugrel]])
** Immunosuppressants ([[cyclosporine]], [[mitomycin]], [[tacrolimus]]/FK506, [[interferon|interferon-α]])
* [[HIV-1]] infection

The mechanism of ''secondary'' TTP is poorly understood, as ADAMTS13 activity is generally not as depressed as in idiopathic TTP, and inhibitors cannot be detected. Probable etiology may involve, at least in some cases, endothelial damage,<ref name=vanMourik1999>{{cite journal|last=vanMourik, Boertjes, Huisveld|first=JA, R, IA, et al|title=von Willebrand factor propeptide in vascular disorders: a tool to distinguish between acute and chronic endothelial cell perturbation|journal=Blood|year=1999|volume=94|pages=174–185|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/94/1/179.full.pdf+html}}</ref> although the formation of thrombi resulting in vessel occlusion may not be essential in the pathogenesis of secondary TTP.<ref name=Iwata2001>{{cite journal|last=Iwata, Kami, Hori, Hamaki, Takeuchi, Mutou|first=H, M, A, T, K, Y|title=An autopsy-based retrospective study of secondary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|journal=Haematologica|year=2001|volume=86|pages=669–670|url=http://www.haematologica.org/content/86/6/669.long.}}</ref> These factors may also be considered a form of secondary aHUS; patients presenting with these features are therefore potential candidates for anti-complement therapy.

===Upshaw-Schülman syndrome===
A hereditary form of TTP is called the ''Upshaw-Schülman syndrome''; this is generally due to inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13 (frameshift and point mutations).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schulman I, Pierce M, Lukens A, Currimbhoy Z |title=Studies on thrombopoiesis.

==Treatment==
Due to the high mortality of untreated TTP, a [[presumptive diagnosis]] of TTP is made even when only microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia is seen, and therapy is started. Since the early 1990s, [[plasmapheresis]] has become the treatment of choice for TTP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zheng XL, Kaufman RM, Goodnough LT, Sadler JE |title=Effect of plasma exchange on plasma ADAMTS13 metalloprotease activity, inhibitor level, and clinical outcome in patients with idiopathic and nonidiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Blood |volume=103 |issue=11 |pages=4043–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14982878 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-11-4035}}</ref> This is an [[exchange transfusion]] involving removal of the patient's [[blood plasma]] through [[apheresis]] and replacement with donor plasma ([[fresh frozen plasma]] or [[cryosupernatant]]); the procedure must be repeated daily to eliminate the inhibitor and abate the symptoms. If apheresis is not available, fresh frozen plasma can be infused, but the volume that can be given safely is limited due to the danger of fluid overload. [[Lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) levels are generally used to monitor disease activity. Plasmapheresis may need to be continued for 1–8 weeks before patients with idiopathic TTP cease to consume platelets and begin to normalize their hemoglobin.  No single laboratory test (platelet count, LDH, ADAMTS13 level, or inhibitory factor) is indicative of recovery; research protocols have used improvement or normalization of LDH as a measure for ending plasmapheresis.  Although patients may be critically ill with failure of multiple organ systems during the acute illness, including renal failure, myocardial ischemia, and neurologic symptoms, recovery over several months may be complete in the absence of a frank myocardial infarct, stroke, or CNS hemorrhage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Most patients with refractory or relapsing TTP receive additional [[immunosuppressive]] therapy, with [[glucocorticoid]] [[steroids]] (e.g. [[prednisolone]] or [[prednisone]]), [[vincristine]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[splenectomy]], [[rituximab]] or a combination of the above.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Children with Upshaw-Schulman syndrome receive prophylactic plasma every two to three weeks; this maintains adequate levels of functioning ADAMTS13.

Measurements of LDH, platelets and schistocytes are used to monitor disease progression or remission.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of TTP is about 4-5 per million people per year.<ref name=Terrell2005>{{cite journal|last=Terrell, Williams, Vesely, Lammle, Hovinga, George|first=DR, LA, SK, B, JAK, JN|title=The incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura- hemolytic uremic syndrome: all patients, idiopathic patients, and patients with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency|journal=J Thromb Haemost|year=2005|volume=3|pages=1432–1436|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01436.x/pdf}}</ref> Idiopathic TTP occurs more often in women and black/African-American people, and TTP secondary to [[autoimmune]] disorders such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) occurs more frequently in blacks/African-Americans, although other secondary forms do not show this distribution.<ref name=Terrell2010>{{cite journal|last=Terrell, Vesely, Hovinga, Lammle, George|first=DR, SK, JAK, B, JN|coauthors=|title=Different disparities of gender and race among the thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndromes|journal=Am J Mematol|year=2010|month=July|volume=85|issue=11|pages=844–847}}</ref> Pregnant women and women in the postpartum period accounted for a notable portion (12-31%) of the cases in some studies; TTP affects approximately 1 in 25,000 pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = X.

==History==
TTP was initially described by Dr Eli Moschcowitz at the [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City]] in 1925. Moschcowitz ascribed the disease (incorrectly, as now known) to a toxic cause. Moschcowitz noted that his patient, a 16 year-old girl, had anemia, [[petechiae]] (purpura), microscopic [[hematuria]], and, at autopsy, [[Disseminated disease|disseminated]] microvascular thrombi.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moschcowitz E |title=An acute febrile pleiochromic anemia with hyaline thrombosis of the terminal arterioles and capillaries: an undescribed disease |journal=Proc NY Pathol Soc |volume=24 |pages=21–4 |year=1924}} Reprinted in ''Mt Sinai J Med'' 2003;70(5):322-5, PMID 14631522.</ref> In 1966, a review of 16 new cases and 255 previously reported cases led to the formulation of the classical pentad of symptoms and findings (i.e., thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic helolytic anemia, neurological symptoms, kidney failure, fever); in this series, mortality rates were found to be very high (90%).<ref name=Amorosi/> While response to blood transfusion had been noted before, a 1978 report and subsequent studies showed that blood plasma was highly effective in improving the disease process.<ref name=Sadler2008 /> In 1991 it was reported that plasma exchange provided better response rates compared to plasma infusion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199108083250604 |author=Rock GA |title=Comparison of plasma exchange with plasma infusion in the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
