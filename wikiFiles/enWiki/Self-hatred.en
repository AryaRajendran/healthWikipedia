'''Self-hatred''' (also called '''self-loathing''') refers to an extreme dislike or [[Hate|hatred]] of oneself, or being angry at or even [[Prejudice|prejudiced]] against oneself. The term is also used to designate a dislike or hatred of a group, [[family]], [[social class]], [[mental illness]], or [[stereotype]] to which one belongs and/or has. For instance, "ethnic self-hatred" is the extreme dislike of one's ethnic group or cultural classification. It may be associated with aspects of [[autophobia]].

The term "self-hatred" is used infrequently by psychologists and psychiatrists, who would usually describe people who hate themselves as "persons with low [[self-esteem]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Self-hatred and [[shame]] are important factors in some or many [[mental disorder]]s, especially disorders that involve a perceived defect of oneself (e.g. [[body dysmorphic disorder]]). Self-hatred is also a symptom of many [[personality disorder]]s, including [[borderline personality disorder]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/borderline-personality-disorder-symptoms|title=Borderline Personality Disorder - Symptoms|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helpsomeonewithdepression.com/am-i-depressed|title=Am I Depressed?|publisher=Help Someone With Depression|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> It can also be linked to guilt for someone's own actions that he or she views as wrongful, e.g. [[survivor guilt]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Types of self-hatred==
The term self-hatred can refer to either a strong dislike for oneself, one's own actions, or a strong dislike or hatred of one's own [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], [[species]] or any other [[corporate group]] of which one may be a member. When used in the latter context it is generally defined as hatred of one's identity based on the demographic in question, as well as a desire to distance oneself from this identity.  The term "self-loathing" is used as a rhetorical tool by holders of extreme nationalistic or racist views to belittle those from the same ethnic group who do not share the views of the labeller.{{Citation Needed|date=August 2012}}

===Personal self-hatred===
Personal self-hatred and self-loathing can result from an [[inferiority complex]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Some [[sociology]] theorists such as [[Jerry Mander]] see [[television programming]] as being deliberately designed to induce self-hatred, negative [[body image]], and [[clinical depression|depression]], with the [[advertising]] then being used to suggest the cure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turnoffyourtv.com/reviews/Jerry.Mander.html|title=Review of Jerry Mander's Four Arguments For The Elimination Of Television|last=Kaufman|first=Ron|publisher=TurnOffYourTV.com|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> See also the arguments related to the ''[[Kill your television]]'' phenomenon. Some personal self-hatred can be linked to [[remorse]] for something a person did or didn't do, or as a result of bullying.

===Self-injury as self-hatred===
{{unsourced section|date=February 2013}}
[[Self-harm]] can be a psychological disorder that may involve self-hatred, where subjects may feel compelled to physically injure themselves as an outlet for depression, anxiety, or anger. In some cases, self-harm can lead to [[accidental death]] or [[suicide]]. It is not a definitive indicator, however, of a desire either to commit suicide or even of its consideration.

===Motivational efficacy===
Blake and Ross (1992) and Ramachandran (1996) from the University of Michigan have studied the potency of self-hatred as a motivational tool and concluded that it is, in Ramachandran's words, "the least potent motivator in our wide survey of human psychology."{{incomplete citation|date=September 2012}}
