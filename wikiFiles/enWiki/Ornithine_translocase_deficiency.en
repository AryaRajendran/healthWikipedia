'''Ornithine translocase deficiency''', also called '''Hyperornithinemia-Hyperammonemia-Homocitrullinuria''' (HHH) '''syndrome''',<ref>{{OMIM|238970}}</ref> is a rare [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3960284 |year=1986 |month=Feb |author=Hommes FA, Roesel RA, Metoki K, Hartlage PL, Dyken PR |title=Studies on a case of HHH-syndrome (hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria) |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=48â€“52 |issn=0174-304X |journal=Neuropediatrics |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1052499}}</ref> [[urea cycle disorder]] affecting the [[enzyme]] [[ornithine translocase]], which causes [[ammonia]] to accumulate in the blood, a condition called [[hyperammonemia]]. 

Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The [[nervous system]] is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.



==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Ornithine translocase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Mutations in the ''[[SLC25A15]]'' gene cause ornithine translocase deficiency. Ornithine translocase deficiency belongs to a class of [[metabolic disorder]]s referred to as [[urea cycle disorders]]. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in [[liver]] cells. This cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the [[kidney]]s. The ''SLC25A15'' gene provides instructions for making a protein called a mitochondrial ornithine transporter. This protein is needed to move a molecule called [[ornithine]] within the [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing centers in cells). Specifically, this protein transports ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the region called the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. Mutations in the ''SLC25A15'' gene result in a mitochondrial ornithine transporter that is unstable or the wrong shape, and which cannot bring ornithine to the mitochondrial matrix. This failure of ornithine transport causes an interruption of the urea cycle and the accumulation of ammonia, resulting in the signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency.

This disorder is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - are required to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.
