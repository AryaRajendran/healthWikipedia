'''Myomectomy''', sometimes also '''fibroidectomy''', refers to the surgical removal of [[Uterine fibroids|uterine leiomyoma]]s, also known as fibroids. In contrast to a [[hysterectomy]] the [[uterus]] remains preserved and the woman retains her reproductive potential.

==Indications==
The presence of a fibroid does not mean that it needs to be removed. Removal is called for when the fibroid causes pain or pressure, abnormal bleeding, or interferes with reproduction.

Patients have many options in the management of uterine fibroids, including: observation, medical therapy (such a [[GNRH agonist]]s),  [[hysterectomy]], [[uterine artery embolization]], and [[high-intensity focused ultrasound]] ablation. Despite these many options, the surgical approach of selected fibroid removal remains an important choice for those women who want or need to preserve the uterus for reproduction.

==Procedure==
A myomectomy can be performed in a number of ways, depending on the location and number of lesions and the experience and preference of the surgeon. Either a general or a spinal anesthesia is administered.

===Laparotomy===
Traditionally a myomectomy is performed via a [[laparotomy]] with a full abdominal incision, either vertically or horizontally. Once the peritoneal cavity is opened, the uterus is incised, and the lesion(s) removed. The open approach is often preferred for larger lesions. One or more incisions may be set into the uterine muscle and are repaired once the fibroid has been removed. Recovery after surgery takes four to six weeks..

===Laparoscopy===
Using the [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic approach]] the uterus is visualized and its fibroids located and removed. [[Morcellators]] are available to shred larger fibroids so that they can be removed through the small portholes of laparoscopy.<ref>{{cite journal

Studies have suggested that laparoscopic myomectomy leads to lower [[morbidity]] rates and faster recovery than does laparotomic myomectomy.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18325839 Agdi, M. and Tulandi, T. “Endoscopic management of uterine fibroids.” ''Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology'', online publication 4 Mar 2008.]</ref> As with hysteroscopic myomectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy is not generally used on very large fibroids.  A study of laparoscopic myomectomies conducted between January 1990 and October 1998 examined 106 cases of laparoscopic myomectomy, in which the fibroids were intramural or subserous and ranged in size from 3 to 10&nbsp;cm.<ref>Soriano, D. et al. "Pregnancy outcome after laparoscopic and laparoconverted myomectomy." ''European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology'' 108 (2003): 194-198.</ref>

===Robotic surgery===
Using the [[da Vinci Surgical System]] a limited numbers of myomectomies have been performed.It has not been proven that results are superior to laparoscopy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bedient CE, Magrina JF, Noble BN, Kho RM. |title=Comparison of robotic and laparoscopic myomectomy.|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol. |pmid=19683685 |year=2009 |volume=201 |issue=6 |pages=566.e1–5 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2009.05.049 }}</ref>

===Hysteroscopy===
A fibroid that is located in a submucous position (that is, protruding into the endometrial cavity) may be accessible to [[hysteroscopy|hysteroscopic]] removal. This may apply primarily to smaller lesions as pointed out by a large study that collected results from 235 patients suffering from submucous myomas who were treated with hysteroscopic myomectomies; in none of these cases was the fibroid greater than 5&nbsp;cm.<ref>Polena, V., et al. "Long-term results of hysteroscopic myomectomy in 235 patients." ''European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology'' 130 (2007): 232-237.</ref> However, also larger lesion have been treated by hysteroscopy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=

==Complications and risks==
Complications of the surgery include the possibility of significant blood loss leading to a [[blood transfusion]], the risk of [[adhesion]] or scar formation around the uterus or within its cavity, and the possible need later to deliver via [[cesarean section]].<ref name=asrm>[http://www.asrm.org/Patients/patientbooklets/uterine_fibroids.pdf American Society of Reproductive Medicine Patient Booklet: ''Uterine Fibroids'', 2003]</ref> 

It may not be possible to remove all lesions, nor will the operation prevent new lesions from growing. Development of new fibroids will be seen in 42-55% of patients undergoing a myomectomy.<ref>{{cite journal

There is some suggestion that myomectomy surgery is associated with a higher risk of [[uterine rupture]] in later pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelly BA, Bright P, Mackenzie IZ. |title=Does the surgical approach used for myomectomy influence the morbidity in subsequent pregnancy? |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol. |pmid=18259905 |year=2008 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=77–81 |doi=10.1080/01443610701811738 }}</ref>

==Myomectomy during pregnancy==
Leiomyomata tend to grow during pregnancy but rarely interfere with the growing pregnancy directly. Generally, surgeons tend to stay away from operative interventions during the pregnancy because of the risk of haemorrhage and the concern that the pregnancy may be interrupted. Also, after a pregnancy, myomas tend to shrink naturally. However, in selected cases myomectomy may become necessary during pregnancy, or also at the time of a [[caesarean section]] to gain access to the baby.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Bhatla N, Dash BB, Kriplani A, Agarwal N. |title=Myomectomy during pregnancy: a feasible option.|journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Res. | pmid=19215567| year=2009| volume=35| issue=1| pages=173–5| doi=10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00873.x}}</ref>
