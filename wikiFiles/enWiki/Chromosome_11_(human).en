'''Chromosome 11''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. Humans normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 11 spans about 134.5 million [[base pair]]s (the building material of [[DNA]]) and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It is one of the most gene- and disease-rich chromosomes in the [[human genome]].

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 11 likely contains between 1,300 and 1,700 genes.

A recent study <ref>{{cite journal | author=Taylor TD, Noguchi H, Totoki Y, Toyoda A, Kuroki Y, Dewar K, Lloyd C, Itoh T, Takeda T, Kim DW, She X, Barlow KF, Bloom T, Bruford E, Chang JL, Cuomo CA, Eichler E, FitzGerald MG, Jaffe DB, LaButti K, Nicol R, Park HS, Seaman C, Sougnez C, Yang X, Zimmer AR, Zody MC, Birren BW, Nusbaum C, Fujiyama A, Hattori M, Rogers J, Lander ES, Sakaki Y | title=Human chromosome 11 DNA sequence and analysis including novel gene identification | journal=Nature | year=2006 | pages=497–500 | volume=440 | issue=7083 | pmid=16554811 | doi=10.1038/nature04632}}</ref> shows that 11.6 genes per [[Base pair#Length measurements|megabase]], including 1,524 protein-coding genes and 765 [[pseudogene]]s can be found on chromosome 11. 

More than 40% of the 856 [[olfactory receptor]] genes in the human genome are located in 28 single- and multi-gene clusters along this chromosome.
