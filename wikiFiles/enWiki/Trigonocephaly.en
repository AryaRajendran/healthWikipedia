'''Trigonocephaly''' (Greek: 'trigonon' = triangle, 'kephale' = head) is a congenital condition of premature fusion of the metopic suture (Greek: 'metopon' = forehead) leading to a triangular shaped forehead. The merging of the two frontal bones leads to transverse growth restriction and parallel growth expansion. It may occur syndromic involving other abnormalities or isolated.

[[Hippocrates]] described trigonocephaly as follows: ''Men's heads are by no means all like to one another, nor are the sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form. Thus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond the rest of it), in him the sutures of the head take the form of the Greek letter 'tau', [[τ]]''.<ref>Hippocrates.

[[Hermann Welcker]] coined the term trigonocephaly in 1862. He described a child with a V-shaped skull and a [[cleft lip]].<ref>Welcker H. Untersugungen uber wachtsum und bau des menschlischen Schädels. Leipzig: Engelmann, 1862.</ref>

==Etiology==
Trigonocephaly can either occur syndromatic or isolated. Trigonocephaly is associated with the following syndromes: [[Opitz syndrome]], [[Muenke syndrome]], [[Jacobsen syndrome]], [[Baller-Gerold syndrome]] and [[Say-Meyer syndrome]]. The etiology of trigonocephaly is mostly unknown although there are three main theories.<ref name="StricklerM1990"/> Trigonocephaly is probably a multifactorial congenital condition, but due to limited proof of these theories this cannot safely be concluded.<ref name="vanderMeulenJJNM2009"/>

===Intrinsic bone malformation===
The first theory assumes that the origin of pathological synostosis lies within disturbed bone formation early on in the pregnancy. Causes can either be genetic<ref>Wilkie AO.

'''Observatory signs''' of trigonocephaly are:

*a triangular shaped forehead seen from top view leading to a smaller [[anterior cranial fossa]]

*a visible and palpable midline ridge

*[[hypotelorism]] inducing [[ethmoidal]] [[hypoplasia]]

'''Imaging techniques''' ([[3D-CT]], [[Röntgenography]], [[MRI]]) show:

*[[epicanthal folds]] in limited cases

*teardrop shaped orbits angulated towards the midline of the forehead ('surprised coon' sign) in severe cases

*a contrast difference between a röntgenograph of a normal and a trigonocephalic skull

*anterior curving of the metopic suture seen from [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] view of the cranium on a röntgenograph

*a normal [[cephalic index]] (maximum [[cranium]] width / maximum cranium length) however, there is bitemporal shortening and biparietal broadening

A form of surgery is the so-called fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired [[greenstick fracture]] to straighten it. Secondly, the supraorbital bar is moved 2&nbsp;cm. forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the [[zygoma]] without fixation to the cranium. Lastly, the frontal bone is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area ([[craniectomy]]) between the [[parietal bone]] and [[frontal bone]]. Bone will eventually regenerate since the [[dura mater]] lies underneath (the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities). This results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead.

===‘Floating forehead technique’<ref name="vanderMeulenJJNM2009"/>===
The so-called ‘floating forehead technique’ combined with the remodelling of the supraorbital bar is derived from the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling.

These approaches are 2D solutions for a 3D problem, therefore the results are not optimal. Distraction osteogenesis and minimal invasive endoscopic surgery are yet in experimental phase.

The simple suturectomy is presently insufficient to adjust the complicated growth restrictions caused by metopic synostosis.<ref name="vanderMeulenJJNM2009"/> On the other hand the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling and the ‘floating forehead technique’ create sufficient space for brain growth and result in a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar.
