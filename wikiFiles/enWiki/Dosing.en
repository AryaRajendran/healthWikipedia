'''Dosing''' generally applies to feeding [[chemical]]s or [[medicine]]s in small quantities into a process fluid or to a [[organism|living being]] at intervals or to atmosphere at intervals to give sufficient time for the chemical or medicine to react or show the results.

In the case of human beings or animals the word ''dose'' is generally used but in the case of inanimate objects the word dosing is used.

==In engineering==
The word ''dosing'' is very commonly used by [[engineer]]s in thermal [[power stations]], in water treatment or in any industry where [[steam]] is being generated. Dosing procedures are also in vogue in [[textile]] and similar industries where chemical treatment is involved. In a power station treatment chemicals are injected or fed to [[boiler]] and also to feed and make up water under [[pressure]], but in small dosages or rate of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The feeding at all places is done by means of small capacity dosing [[pump]]s specially designed for the duty demanded.

==In agriculture==
The feeding of chemicals in [[agriculture]] has also become common due to technology developments. However agricultural dosing is done by means of hand held pressure spray pumps or similar devices. 

==Aerial spraying==
Sometimes aerial spraying of chemicals by fixed quantities at intervals or dosing is also adopted for agricultural spraying or for atmospheric spraying for eliminating certain types of harmful [[insect]]s.
