'''Green Tobacco Sickness''' ('''GTS''') is a type of [[nicotine poisoning]] caused by the dermal absorption of nicotine from the surface of wet [[tobacco plants]].<ref name="Schep">{{cite journal |author=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Beasley DM |title=Nicotinic plant poisoning |journal=[[Clinical Toxicology| Clinical Toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)]] |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=771â€“81  |year=2009 |month=September-October  |pmid=19778187  |doi=10.1080/15563650903252186}}</ref> Tobacco harvesters, whose clothing becomes saturated from tobacco wet with [[rain]] or [[dew|morning dew]], are at high risk of developing GTS. Workers can avoid getting this sickness by waiting to harvest until the tobacco leaves are dry, or by wearing a  rain suit. Wet clothing that has come in contact with tobacco leaves should be removed immediately and the skin washed with warm soapy water. 

Use of tobacco products such as [[cigarettes]] or [[dipping tobacco|smokeless tobacco]], appears to reduce the risk of GTS due to the body adapting to the intake of [[nicotine]].

Symptoms of GTS include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], and severe weakness.<ref name="Schep"/> These symptoms may be accompanied by fluctuations in [[blood pressure]] or [[heart rate]]. Abdominal cramping, chills, increased sweating, salivation and difficulty breathing are also common.<ref name="Schep"/> The illness will resolve on its own within one to two days, but symptoms may be so severe as to require emergency medical treatment. 

In the [[United States]], where tobacco is increasingly being farmed on large farms, seasonal or [[migrant workers|migrant farmworkers]] are disproportionately affected by this condition. Worldwide there are an estimated 33 million tobacco farm workers, with a substantial proportion living in developing countries. A recent international review reported that between 8-89% of tobacco harvesters may be affected in the course of a season (this wide variation probably being due to differences between study methodologies as well as a range of working conditions). The long-term health outcomes for individuals exposed to nicotine transdermally for extended periods of time are not known.<ref>[http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-3-health-effects/3-20-tobacco-poisoning/ Tobacco in Australia]</ref>
