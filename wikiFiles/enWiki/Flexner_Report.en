The '''Flexner Report'''<ref>{{Citation | author=Flexner, Abraham | year=1910 | title=Medical Education in the United States and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | series=Bulletin No. 4. | publisher=The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | location=New York City | pages=346 | oclc=9795002 | url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/publications/medical-education-united-states-and-canada-bulletin-number-four-flexner-report-0 | accessdate=April 20, 2010 }}</ref> is a book-length study of medical education in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], written by the professional educator [[Abraham Flexner]] and published in 1910 under the [[aegis]] of the [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]]. Many aspects of the present-day American medical profession stem from the Flexner Report and its aftermath.  

The Report (also called Carnegie Foundation Bulletin Number Four) called on [[Medical school in the United States|American medical schools]] to enact higher admission and graduation standards, and to adhere strictly to the protocols of mainstream [[science]] in their teaching and research. Many American medical schools fell short of the standard advocated in the Report, and subsequent to its publication, nearly half of such schools merged or were closed outright. The Report also concluded that there were too many medical schools in the USA, and that too many doctors were being trained. A repercussion of the Flexner Report, resulting from the closure or consolidation of university training, was reversion of American universities to male-only admittance programs to accommodate a smaller admission pool. Universities had begun opening and expanding female admissions as part of women's and co-educational facilities only in the mid-to-latter part of the 19th century with the founding of co-educational [[Oberlin College]] in 1833 and private colleges such as [[Vassar College]] and [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]].

== History ==
In 1904 the [[American Medical Association|AMA]] created the Council on Medical Education (CME) whose objective was to restructure American medical education. At its first annual meeting, the CME adopted two standards: one laid down the minimum prior education required for admission to a medical school, the other defined a medical education as consisting of two years training in human [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] followed by two years of clinical work in a [[teaching hospital]]. In 1908, the CME asked the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] to survey American medical education, so as to promote the CME's reformist agenda and hasten the elimination of medical schools that failed to meet the CME's standards. The president of the Carnegie Foundation, [[Henry Pritchett]], a staunch advocate of medical school reform, chose Flexner to conduct the survey.  Flexner was not a physician, scientist, or a medical educator, although he held a bachelor of arts degree and operated a for-profit school in Louisville, Kentucky.<ref name=Goodman_143>{{Harvnb|Goodman|Musgrave|1992|pp=142–148}}</ref>

At that time, the 155 medical schools in North America differed greatly in their curricula, methods of assessment, and requirements for admission and graduation. Flexner visited all 155 schools and generalized about them as follows: "Each day students were subjected to interminable lectures and recitations. After a long morning of dissection or a series of quiz sections, they might sit wearily in the afternoon through three or four or even five lectures delivered in methodical fashion by part-time teachers. Evenings were given over to reading and preparation for recitations. If fortunate enough to gain entrance to a hospital, they observed more than participated." The Report became notorious for its harsh description of certain establishments, for example describing Chicago's 14 medical schools as "a disgrace to the State whose laws permit its existence... indescribably foul... the plague spot of the nation."

Nevertheless, several schools received praise for excellent performance, including [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]], [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve]], [[University of Michigan Health System|Michigan]], [[Wake Forest University School of Medicine]], [[McGill University|McGill]], [[University of Toronto]], and especially [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] - the latter was described as 'model for medical education'.<ref>Raffel MN, Raffel NK. The US Health System: origins and functions. 4th ed. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers; 1994:11.</ref>

== Recommended changes ==
When Flexner researched his report, many American medical schools were "proprietary", namely small trade schools owned by one or more doctors, unaffiliated with a college or university, and [[For-profit education|run to make a profit]]. A degree was typically awarded after only two years of study.  Laboratory work and dissection were not necessarily required. Many of the instructors were local doctors teaching part-time, whose own training left something to be desired.  The regulation of the medical profession by state government was minimal or nonexistent.  American doctors varied enormously in their scientific understanding of [[human physiology]], and the word "quack" flourished. 

Flexner looked this situation in the face.  Using the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] as the ideal,<ref>[http://www.unmc.edu/Community/ruralmeded/flexner.htm UNMC's ''Flexner's Impact on American Medicine'']</ref> he issued the following recommendations:<ref name=Barzansky1992 />
# Reduce the number of medical schools (from 155 to 31) and poorly trained physicians;
# Increase the prerequisites to enter medical training;
# Train physicians to practice in a scientific manner and engage medical faculty in research;
# Give medical schools control of clinical instruction in hospitals
# Strengthen state regulation of medical licensure

Flexner believed that admission to a medical school should require, at minimum, a [[high school]] [[diploma]] and at least two years of [[college]] or [[university]] study, primarily devoted to basic science.  When Flexner researched his report, only 16 out of 155 medical schools in the United States and Canada required applicants to have completed two or more years of university education.<ref name=Flexner_28>{{Harvnb|Flexner|Pritchet|1910|pp=28}}</ref>  By 1920 92 percent of U.S. medical schools required this of applicants.<ref name=FlexnerImpactOnUSmedSchools>{{cite journal|last=Hiatt|first=Mark D.|coauthors=Christopher Stockton|title=The Impact of the Flexner Report on the Fate of Medical Schools in North America After 1909|journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons|year=2003|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.jpands.org/vol8no2/hiatt.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref>  Flexner also argued that the length of medical education should be four years, and its content should be what the CME agreed to in 1905.  Flex recommended that the proprietary medical schools should either close or be incorporated into existing universities.  Medical schools should be part of a larger university, because a proper stand-alone medical school would have to charge too much in order to break even.

Less known is Flexner's recommendation that medical schools appoint full-time clinical professors. Holders of these appointments would become "true university teachers, barred from all but charity practice, in the interest of teaching." Flexner pursued this objective for years, despite widespread opposition from existing medical faculty.

Flexner was the child of German immigrants, and had studied and traveled in Europe. He was well aware that one could not practice medicine in continental Europe without having undergone an extensive specialized university education. In effect, Flexner was demanding that American medical education conform to prevailing practice in continental Europe.

By and large, medical schools in Canada and the United States have followed Flexner's recommendations down to the present day. Recently, however, schools have increased their emphasis on [[public health]] matters.

== Consequences of the report ==
To a remarkable extent, the following present-day aspects of the medical profession in North America are consequences of the Flexner Report:
* A physician receives at least six,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and preferably eight, years of post-secondary formal instruction, nearly always in a university setting;
* Medical training adheres closely to the scientific method and is thoroughly grounded in human physiology and [[biochemistry]]. Medical research adheres fully to the protocols of scientific research;<ref name=Beck2004>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Andrew H.|title=The Flexner report and the standardization of American medical education.|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=5|year=2004|month=May|volume=291|issue=17|pages=2139–40|doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2139|pmid=15126445|url=http://cosbyig.com/documents/Flexner%20report.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref> 
* Average physician quality has increased significantly;<ref name=Barzansky1992>{{cite book|last=Barzansky|first=Barbara|title=Beyond Flexner: Medical Education in the Twentieth Century|year=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0313259845|edition=1. publ.|coauthors=[[Norman Gevitz|Gevitz, Norman]]}}</ref> 
* No medical school can be created without the permission of the state government. Likewise, the size of existing medical schools is subject to state regulation;
* Each state branch of the [[American Medical Association]] has oversight over the conventional medical schools located within the state;
* The cost of health care is vastly increased;
* Medicine in the USA and Canada becomes a highly paid and well-respected profession.

The Report is now remembered because it succeeded in creating a single model of medical education, characterized by a philosophy that has largely survived to the present day. "An education in medicine," wrote Flexner, "involves both learning and learning how; the student cannot effectively know, unless he knows how." Although the report is over 100 years old, many of its recommendations are still relevant—particularly those concerning the physician as a "social instrument... whose function is fast becoming social and preventive, rather than individual and curative."

=== Closure of many medical schools ===
Flexner sought to reduce the number of medical schools in the U.S. to 31, and to cut the annual number of medical graduates from 4,400 to 2,000.<ref name=FlexnerImpactOnUSmedSchools />  A majority of American institutions granting [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degrees as of the date of the Report (1910) closed within two to three decades. (No Canadian medical school was deemed inadequate, and none closed or merged subsequent to the Report.) In 1904, there were 160 M.D. granting institutions with more than 28,000 students. By 1920, there were only 85 M.D. granting institution, educating only 13,800 students. By 1935, there were only 66 medical schools operating in the USA.  

Between 1910 and 1935, more than half of all American medical schools merged or closed. This dramatic decline was in some part due to the implementation of the Report's recommendation that all "proprietary" schools be closed, and that medical schools should henceforth all be connected to universities. Of the 66 surviving MD-granting institutions in 1935, 57 were part of a university. An important factor driving the mergers and closures of medical schools was that all state medical boards gradually adopted and enforced the Report's recommendations. In response to the report, some schools fired senior faculty members as part of a process of reform and renewal.<ref>World J Surg. 2012 Mar;36(3):684-8 https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/32172</ref >

One of the consequences of Flexner's advocacy of university-based medical education was that medical education became much more expensive, putting such education out of reach of all but upper-class white males. The small "proprietary" schools Flexner condemned, which were contended to be have been based in generations-old folk traditions rather than relatively recent Western science, did admit African-Americans, women, and students of limited financial means. These students usually could not afford six to eight years of university education, and were often simply denied admission to medical schools affiliated with universities.  While many such doctors continued to practice, they did so under proscribed circumstances and for less pay.  It also made it more difficult for people of color, residents of rural areas, and for those of limited means generally to obtain medical care in any form.

=== Impact on alternative medicine ===
When Flexner researched his report, "modern" medicine faced vigorous competition from several quarters, including [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]], chiropractic medicine, [[eclectic medicine]], [[naturopathy]] and [[homeopathy]]. Flexner clearly doubted the scientific validity of all forms of medicine other than that based on scientific research, deeming any approach to medicine that did not advocate the use of treatments such as vaccines to prevent and cure illness as tantamount to quackery and charlatanism.  Medical schools that offered training in various disciplines including eclectic medicine, physiomedicalism, naturopathy, and homeopathy, were told either to drop these courses from their curriculum or lose their accreditation and underwriting support. A few schools resisted for a time, but eventually all complied with the Report or shut their doors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

=== Impact on osteopathic medicine ===
Although almost all the alternative medical schools listed in Flexner's report were closed, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) was able to bring a number of osteopathic medical schools into compliance with Flexner's recommendations and produce an evidence-based practice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}  [[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States|The curricula of DO and MD awarding medical schools are now nearly identical]], the chief difference being the additional instruction in osteopathic schools of [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]]. This dramatic convergence of osteopathic and biomedical training demonstrates the sweeping effect the Flexner report had, not only in the closure of inadequate schools, but also in the standardization of the curricula of surviving schools.
