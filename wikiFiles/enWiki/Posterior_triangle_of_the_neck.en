The '''posterior triangle''' (or '''lateral cervical region''') is a region of the [[neck]].

==Boundaries==
It has the following boundaries:

'''Apex:''' Union of the [[sternocleidomastoid]] and the [[trapezius]] muscles at the [[superior nuchal line]] of the [[occipital bone]]

'''Anterior:''' Posterior border of the [[sternocleidomastoideus]]

'''Posterior:''' Anterior border of the [[trapezius]]

'''Base:''' Middle one third of the [[clavicle]]

==Divisions==
The posterior triangle is crossed, about 2.5&nbsp;cm above the clavicle, by the inferior belly of the [[omohyoideus|omohyoid muscle]], which divides the space into two triangles:
* an upper or [[occipital triangle]]
* a lower or [[subclavian triangle]] (or '''supraclavicular triangle''')

==Contents==
'''A) Nerves and Plexuses:'''
* [[Spinal accessory nerve]] (Cranial Nerve XI)
* Branches of [[cervical plexus]]
* Roots and trunks of [[brachial plexus]]
* Phrenic nerve (C3,4,5)


'''B) Vessels:'''
* [[Subclavian artery]] (Third part)
* [[Transverse cervical]] artery
* [[Suprascapular artery]]
* Terminal part of [[external jugular vein]]
'''C) Lymph Nodes:'''
* Occipital
* Supraclavicular
'''D) Muscles:'''
* Inferior belly of [[omohyoid muscle]]
* Anterior Scalene
* Middle Scalene
* Posterior Scalene
* Levator Scapulae Muscle
* Splenius Muscle

==Clinical significance==
The accessory nerve (CN XI) is particularly vulnerable to damage during lymph node biopsy. Damage results in an inability to shrug the shoulders or raise the arm above the head (e.g., for brushing hair), particularly due to compromised [[trapezius muscle]] innervation.

The [[external jugular vein]]'s superficial location within the posterior triangle also makes it vulnerable to injury.
