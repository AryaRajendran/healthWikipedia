''' Belching''' (also known as '''burping''', '''''ructus''''', or '''eructation''') is the release of [[gas]] from the digestive tract (mainly [[esophagus]] and [[stomach]]) through the [[mouth]]. It is usually accompanied with a typical sound and, at times, an [[halitosis|odor]].

==Physiology==
Belching is generally caused by  [[aerophagia|swallowing air]] when eating or drinking and subsequently expelling (or inhaling) it, so in this case the expelled gas is mainly a mixture of [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. Burps can also be caused by drinking [[carbonation|carbonated]] drinks such as [[beer]], [[soft drink]]s, [[energy drink]]s or [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], in which case the expelled  gas is primarily [[carbon dioxide]] from the drink itself. Common diabetes drugs metformin<ref>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=3653 DailyMed: About DailyMed]</ref> and Byetta<ref>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=5430 DailyMed: About DailyMed]</ref> can cause belching, especially at higher doses. This often resolves in a few weeks. Belching combined with other symptoms such as [[dyspepsia]], [[nausea]] and [[heartburn]] may be a sign of an [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] or [[hiatal hernia]], and should be reviewed by a physician.<ref>[http://wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/belching/book-causes-8c.htm Eructation (Professional Guide to Signs & Symptoms (Fifth Edition)) - WrongDiagnosis.com]</ref>
Other causes of belching: [[food allergy]], [[gallbladder]] problems, [[acid reflux]] disease, [[H. pylori]], and [[gastritis]].

The sound of burping is caused by the [[oscillation|vibration]] of the [[upper esophageal sphincter]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lang, I.M. |title=Upper esophageal sphincter |journal=GI Motility online |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/gimo12 |url=http://www.nature.com/gizmo/contents/pt1/full/gimo12.html}}</ref> as the gas passes through it.
In  [[microgravity]] environments, belching is normally associated with [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].  The valve at the top of the stomach (the [[gastroesophageal junction]]) does not produce a tight seal, and in the absence of gravity, the stomach contents tend to float near this loose seal, making them likely to come up along with the expelled air.<ref>Vickie Kloeris (01 May 2001).

==Infants==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
[[Infant|Babies]] are particularly subject to accumulation of gas in the stomach while feeding, and this can cause considerable discomfort and agitation unless the child is burped. The act of burping an infant involves placing the child in a position conducive to gas expulsion (for example holding the infant up to the adult's shoulder, with the infant's stomach resting on the adult's chest) and then lightly patting the lower back so that the child burps. Because burping can cause [[vomiting]] in infants, a "burp cloth" or "burp pad" is sometimes employed on the shoulder to protect the adult's clothing.

==Cultural acceptance==
In certain cultures, notably Chinese and Indian,<ref name="KYC">[http://know.burrp.com/loose-ends/to-burrp-or-not-to-burrp/26173 "To burp or not to burp", by Shirin Mehrotra - Know Your City]</ref> belching, given appropriate contexts, are regarded as being acceptable.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/secretarial-when-it-is-polite-to-burp-1196980.html Secretarial: When it is polite to burp] Cultural awareness can mean the difference between success and failure.</ref> In Japan, belching during a meal is considered bad manners.<ref>http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/cultural-services/articles/dining-etiquette-japan.html</ref> In others, particularly Western cultures, such as North American, French, Italian, and British cultures, belching is deemed socially inappropriate.<ref name="KYC"/>

==In other animals==
Many other [[mammal]]s, such as [[cattle]], [[dog]]s, and [[sheep]] also belch. In the case of [[ruminant]]s, the gas (wind) expelled is actually [[methane]] produced as a [[byproduct]] of the animal's [[digestion|digestive process]]. This methane is produced exclusively by a narrow cohert of  [[methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] produce this effect; ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') and other bacteria lack the enzymes and cofactors required for methane production. An average cow is thought to emit between 542 litres (if located in a barn) and 600 litres (if in a field) of methane per day through belching and exhalation, making commercially farmed cattle a major{{quantify|date=July 2012}} contributor to the [[greenhouse effect]].  95% of this gas (wind) is emitted through belching.<ref>[http://www.mycattle.com/health/dsp_health_article.cfm?storyid=10045 MyCattle Health News]</ref> This has led scientists at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Australia]], to develop an anti-methanogen vaccine to minimize methane in cattle belchs.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nowak, R. |title=Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions |agency= |work= |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |pages= |page= |date=5 September 2004 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431}}</ref>

One reason that domesticated [[cows]] belch so much is because they are often fed foods that their digestive systems do not process, such as [[maize|corn]] and [[soy]]. Some farmers have reduced belching in their cows by feeding them [[alfalfa]] and [[flaxseed]], which are closer to the grasses that they had eaten in the wild before they were domesticated.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Greening the Herds: A New Diet to Cap Gas |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |pages= |page= |date=June 4, 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/us/05cows.html}}</ref>

In some animals, a failure to belch successfully can be [[Biological death|fatal]]. This is particularly common among domesticated ruminants that are allowed to gorge themselves on very rich spring [[clover]] or [[alfalfa]]. The condition, known as [[bloat]], is basically a high pressure buildup of gastric gases and requires immediate veterinary treatment, usually the insertion of a flexible rubber hose down the esophagus—or in extreme cases the lancing of the animal's side with a [[trochar|trochar and cannula]]—to expel the buildup of gas. Some [[fish]] are also known to expel air from their gills; here the belch is produced by gas being expelled from the [[gas bladder]].
