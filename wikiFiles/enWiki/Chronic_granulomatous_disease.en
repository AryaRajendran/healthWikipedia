==Classification==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
Chronic granulomatous disease is the name for a genetically heterogeneous group of immunodeficiencies.  The core defect is a failure of phagocytic cells to kill organisms that they have engulfed because of defects in a system of enzymes that produce free radicals and other toxic small molecules.  There are several types, including chronic X-linked disease, chronic b-negative disease, X-linked cytochrome b-positive disease, x-linked variant disease, and atypical granulomatous disease.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=306400</ref>

==Symptoms==
Classically, patients with chronic granulomatous disease will suffer from recurrent bouts of infection due to the decreased capacity of their immune system to fight off disease-causing organisms.  The recurrent infections they acquire are specific and are, in decreasing order of frequency:
* [[pneumonia]]
* [[abscess]]es of the skin, tissues, and organs
* [[suppurative arthritis]]
* [[osteomyelitis]]
* [[bacteremia]]/[[fungemia]]
* superficial skin infections such as [[cellulitis]] or [[impetigo]]

Most people with CGD are diagnosed in childhood, usually before age 5.<ref name=Winkelstein>{{cite journal | author = Winkelstein J, Marino M, Johnston R, Boyle J, Curnutte J, Gallin J, Malech H, Holland S, Ochs H, Quie P, Buckley R, Foster C, Chanock S, Dickler H | title = Chronic granulomatous disease.

===Atypical infections===
[[Image:Aspergillus fumigatus 01.jpg|thumb|right|Microscopic image of the fungus, ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'', an organism that commonly causes disease in people with chronic granulomatous disease.]]
People with CGD are sometimes infected with organisms that usually do not cause disease in people with normal immune systems.  Among the most common organisms that cause disease in CGD patients are:
* bacteria (particularly those that are [[catalase]]-positive)<ref name="pmid17594870">{{cite journal |author=Soler-Palacín P, Margareto C, Llobet P, ''et al.'' |title=Chronic granulomatous disease in pediatric patients: 25 years of experience |journal=Allergol Immunopathol (Madr) |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=83–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17594870 |doi= 10.1157/13106774|url=http://www.elsevier.es/revistas/0301-0546/35/83 |accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>

* fungi
** ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species. Aspergillus has a propensity to cause infection in people with CGD and of the Aspergillus species, ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' seems to be most common in CGD.
** ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' species.
Patients with CGD can usually resist infections of catalase-negative bacteria. Catalase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide in many organisms. In organisms that lack catalase (catalase-negative), normal metabolic functions will cause an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide which the host's immune system can use to fight off the infection. In organisms that have catalase (catalase-positive), the enzyme breaks down any hydrogen peroxide that was produced through normal metabolism. Therefore hydrogen peroxide will not accumulate, leaving the patient vulnerable to catalase-positive bacteria.

== Genetics ==
Most cases of chronic granulomatous disease are transmitted as a mutation on the [[X chromosome]] and are thus called an "[[Sex linkage|X-linked trait]]".<ref name=Winkelstein>{{cite journal | author = Winkelstein J, Marino M, Johnston R et al. | title = Chronic granulomatous disease. Report on a national registry of 368 patients | journal = Medicine (Baltimore) | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–69 | year = 2000 | pmid=10844935 | doi = 10.1097/00005792-200005000-00003}}</ref>  The affected gene on the X chromosome codes for the gp91 [[protein]] [[p91-PHOX]] (''p'' is the weight of the protein in [[kDa]]; the ''g'' means [[glycoprotein]]).  CGD can also be transmitted in an [[autosomal recessive]] fashion (via [[Cytochrome b-245, alpha polypeptide|CYBA]] and [[NCF1]]) and affects other PHOX proteins.  The type of mutation that causes both types of CGD are varied and may be deletions, frame-shift, nonsense, and missense.<ref name=HeyworthPG>{{cite journal | author = Heyworth P, Curnutte J, Rae J, Noack D, Roos D, van Koppen E, Cross A | title = Hematologically important mutations: X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (second update) | journal = Blood Cells Mol Dis | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–26 | year = 2001 | pmid=11162142 | doi=10.1006/bcmd.2000.0347}}</ref><ref name=Cross>{{cite journal | author = Cross A, Noack D, Rae J, Curnutte J, Heyworth P | title = Hematologically important mutations: the autosomal recessive forms of chronic granulomatous disease (first update) | journal = Blood Cells Mol Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 561–5 | year = 2000 | pmid=11112388 | doi=10.1006/bcmd.2000.0333}}</ref>

A low level of NADPH, the cofactor required for superoxide synthesis, can lead to CGD. This has been reported in women who are [[homozygous]] for the genetic defect causing [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] (G6PD), which is characterised by reduced NADPH levels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Segmented neutrophils.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[neutrophil]]s among many [[red blood cell]]s.  Neutrophils are one type of cell affected by chronic granulomatous disease.]]
Phagocytes (i.e., [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]], [[monocyte]]s, and [[macrophage]]s) require an [[enzyme]] to produce [[reactive oxygen species]] to destroy [[bacterium|bacteria]] after they ingest the bacteria in a process called [[phagocytosis]], a process known as the [[respiratory burst]]. This enzyme is termed "phagocyte [[NADPH oxidase]]" (''PHOX'').  The initial step in this process involves the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to produce [[superoxide]] anion, a free radical.  Superoxide then undergoes a further series of reactions to produce products such as hydrogen peroxide (through the action of [[superoxide dismutase]]), hydroxyl radical and hypochlorite (bleach - through the action of [[myeloperoxidase]] on hydrogen peroxide). The [[reactive oxygen species]] this enzyme produces are toxic to bacteria and help the phagocyte kill them once they are ingested. Defects in one of the four essential subunits of this enzyme can all cause CGD of varying severity, dependent on the defect. There are over 410 known possible defects in the PHOX enzyme complex that can lead to chronic granulomatous disease.<ref name=Heyworth />

==Diagnosis==
The [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|nitroblue-tetrazolium]] (NBT) test is the original and most widely-known test for chronic granulomatous disease.<ref name=Kasper>Kasper, DL, Fauci, AS, Longo, DL, Braunwald, E, Hauser, SL, and Jameson, JL. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th edition 2005;357. ISBN 0-07-139140-1.</ref> It is negative in CGD, meaning that it does not turn blue. The higher the blue score, the better the cell is at producing reactive oxygen species. This test depends upon the direct reduction of NBT by [[superoxide]] free radical to form an insoluble formazan.  This test is simple to perform and gives rapid results, but only tells whether or not there is a problem with the PHOX enzymes, not how much they are affected.  A similar test uses dihydrorhodamine (DHR) where whole blood is stained with DHR, incubated, and stimulated to produce superoxide radicals which oxidize DHR to rhodamin in cells with normal function. An advanced test called the cytochrome C reduction assay tells physicians how much superoxide a patient's phagocytes can produce.  Once the diagnosis of CGD is established, a genetic analysis may be used to determine exactly which mutation is the underlying cause.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Treatment==
Management of chronic granulomatous disease revolves around two goals: 1) diagnose the disease early so that [[antibiotic]] prophylaxis can be given to keep an infection from occurring, and 2) educate the patient about his or her condition so that prompt treatment can be given if an infection occurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Antibiotics===
Physicians often prescribe the antibiotic [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]] to prevent bacterial infections.<ref name=Weening>{{cite journal | author = Weening R, Kabel P, Pijman P, Roos D | title = Continuous therapy with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in patients with chronic granulomatous disease | journal = J Pediatr | volume = 103 | issue = 1 | pages = 127–30 | year = 1983 | pmid=6408232 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(83)80798-7}}</ref>  This drug also has the benefit of sparing the normal bacteria of the digestive tract.  Fungal infection is commonly prevented with [[itraconazole]],<ref name=Cale>{{cite journal | author = Cale C, Jones A, Goldblatt D | title = Follow up of patients with chronic granulomatous disease diagnosed since 1990 | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 351–5 | year = 2000 | pmid=10792387 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2249.2000.01234.x | pmc = 1905649}}</ref> although a newer drug of the same type called [[voriconazole]] may be more effective.<ref name=Sabo>{{cite journal | author = Sabo J, Abdel-Rahman S | title = Voriconazole: a new triazole antifungal | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 1032–43 | year = 2000 | pmid=10981251 | doi=10.1345/aph.19237}}</ref>  The use of this drug for this purpose is still under scientific investigation.

===Immunomodulation===
[[Interferon]], in the form of [[interferon gamma-1b]] (Actimmune) is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for the prevention of infection in CGD.  It has been shown to reduce infections in CGD patients by 70% and to decrease their severity.  Although its exact mechanism is still not entirely understood, it has the ability to give CGD patients more immune function and therefore, greater ability to fight off infections.  This therapy has been standard treatment for CGD for several years.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199102213240801 | author = | title = A controlled trial of interferon gamma to prevent infection in chronic granulomatous disease.

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)===
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched donor is curative although not without significant risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones LB, McGrogan P, Flood TJ, ''et al.'' |title=Special article: chronic granulomatous disease in the United Kingdom and Ireland: a comprehensive national patient-based registry |journal=Clin. Exp. Immunol. |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=211–8 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18410635 |pmc=2384093 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03644.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Soncini E, Slatter MA, Jones LB, ''et al.'' |title=Unrelated donor and HLA-identical sibling haematopoietic stem cell transplantation cure chronic granulomatous disease with good long-term outcome and growth |journal=Br.

==Prognosis==
There are currently no studies detailing the long term outcome of chronic granulomatous disease with modern treatment. Without treatment, children often die in the first decade of life. The increased severity of X-linked CGD results in a decreased survival rate of patients, as 20% of X-link patients die of CGD-related causes by the age of 10, in contrast to an approximate age of 35 in autosomal recessive patients.<ref name="vandenBerg"/>

==Epidemiology==
CGD affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the [[United States]], with about 20 new cases diagnosed each year.<ref name="Maryland"/><ref name="Andrews"/>

Chronic granulomatous disease affects all people of all races, however, there is limited information on prevalence outside of the United States. One survey in Sweden reported an incidence of 1 in 220,000 people,<ref name="emedicine.medscape.com">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/956936-overview</ref> while a larger review of studies in Europe suggested a lower rate: 1 in 250,000 people.<ref name="vandenBerg">{{cite journal | author = van den Berg MJ, Van Koppen E, Ahlin A, et al. | title = Chronic Granulomatous Disease: The European Experience | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | year = 2009 | pmid=19381301 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005234 | editor1-last = Alspaugh | editor1-first = Andy | pages = e5234 | pmc = 2668749}}</ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
This condition was first described in 1954 by Janeway, who reported five cases of the disease in children.<ref>http://www.medimmunol.com/content/5/1/4#B1</ref>  In 1957 it was further characterized  as "a fatal granulomatosus of childhood".<ref name="Berendes"/><ref name="Bridges"/>  The underlying cellular mechanism that causes chronic granulomatous disease was discovered in 1967, and research since that time has further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.<ref name="Baehner"/>  Use of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical abscess drainage, and vaccination lead to the term "fatal" being dropped from the name of the disease as children survived into adulthood.   The oldest person to suffer from Chronic Granulomatos Disease was Mr. Jackie Ray Johnson of Fredericksburg, Virginia who died in 2002 at the age of 63.

==Research==
Gene therapy is currently being studied as a possible treatment for chronic granulomatous disease.  CGD is well-suited for gene therapy since it is caused by a mutation in single gene which only affects one body system (the [[hematopoietic system]]).  Viruses have been used to deliver a normal gp91 gene to rats with a mutation in this gene, and subsequently the phagocytes in these rats were able to produce [[oxygen radical]]s.<ref name=Dinauer>{{cite journal | author = Dinauer M, Gifford M, Pech N, Li L, Emshwiller P | title = Variable correction of host defense following gene transfer and bone marrow transplantation in murine X-linked chronic granulomatous disease | journal = Blood | volume = 97 | issue = 12 | pages = 3738–45 | year = 2001 | pmid=11389011 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V97.12.3738}}</ref>

In 2006, two human patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease underwent [[gene therapy]] and blood cell precursor [[stem cell]] transplantation to their [[bone marrow]].  Both patients recovered from their CGD, clearing pre-existing infections and demonstrating increased oxidase activity in their neutrophils.  However, long-term complications and efficacy of this therapy are unknown.<ref name=Ott>{{cite journal | author = Ott M, Schmidt M, Schwarzwaelder K, et al. | title = Correction of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease by gene therapy, augmented by insertional activation of MDS1-EVI1, PRDM16 or SETBP1 | journal = Nat Med | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 401–9 | year = 2006 | pmid=16582916 | doi=10.1038/nm1393}}</ref>
