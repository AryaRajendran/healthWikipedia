The '''Heaf test''', a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] skin test, is performed to determine whether or not a child has been exposed to [[tuberculosis]]. Also known as the '''Sterneedle test''',<ref name="Nolan1996">{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Thomas E.|title=Primary care for the obstetrician and gynecologist|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XTDzmKfWkSQC&pg=PA285|accessdate=17 October 2010|year=1996|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley-IEEE]]|isbn=978-0-471-12279-1|page=285}}</ref> it is administered by a Heaf gun (trademarked "Sterneedle")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ip.com/pdf/patent/US3969497.pdf|title=Test substance for tuberculosis|date=13 July 1976|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=17 October 2010|quote=...multiple scratch scarifications by an instrument known as the Heaf gun (also known by the Trademark "Sterneedle"), or by...}}</ref> which is a spring-loaded instrument with six needles arranged in a circular formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/blackmed/heaf_test|title=Heaf Test |year=2010|work=Black's Medical Dictionary, 42nd Edition|publisher=[[A & C Black]]|location=London|accessdate=17 October 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

Patients who exhibit a negative reaction to the [[Test method|test]] may be offered [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] vaccination. The test is named after [[F. R. G. Heaf]]. Until 2005, the test was used in the United Kingdom to determine if the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] vaccine was needed; the [[Mantoux test]] is now used instead.  The Heaf test was preferred in the UK, because the Heaf test was thought to be easier to interpret, with less variability between observers, and less training was required to administer and read the test.  The test was withdrawn because manufacturers could not be found for tuberculin or Heaf guns.

The Heaf test is used to test for tuberculosis in [[Adolescence|adolescents]] aged around 13&ndash;14.<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Ian|last1=Shaw|first2=Louise|last2=Woodward|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sprmedanth/british|title=Cultures: British |year=2004|work=Encyclopedia of Medical Anthropology: Health and Illness in the World's Cultures|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|location=Dordrecht|accessdate=17 October 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

==Procedure==
A '''Heaf gun''' is used to inject multiple samples of testing serum under the skin at once. The needle points are dipped in tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and pricked into the skin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry.do?id=3163273|title=Sterneedle test|year=1992|work=Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology|publisher=[[Elsevier#Science &Technology|Elsevier Science & Technology]]|location=Oxford|accessdate=17 October 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref>
A Heaf gun with disposable single-use heads is recommended.  

The gun injects PPD equivalent to 100,000 units per ml to the skin over the flexor surface of the left forearm in a circular pattern of six. The test is read between two and seven days later. The injection must not be into sites containing superficial veins.

The reading of the Heaf test is defined by a scale:

*Negative - No induration, maybe six minute puncture scars
*Grade 1 - four to six papules (also considered negative)
*Grade 2 - Confluent papules form indurated ring (positive)
*Grade 3 - Central filling to form disc (positive)
*Grade 4 - Disc >10&nbsp;mm with or without blistering (strongly positive)

Grades 1 and 2 may be the result of previous BCG or avian tuberculosis. 

Children who have a grade 3 or 4 reaction require [[X-ray]] and follow-up.

For interpretation of the test, see [[Tuberculosis diagnosis]].

==Other tests==
The equivalent [[Mantoux test]] positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 mL 100 TU/mL, 1:1000) are 
*0–4&nbsp;mm induration (Heaf 0-1)
*5–14&nbsp;mm induration (Heaf 2)
*&gt;15&nbsp;mm induration (Heaf 3-4)

The [[Mantoux test]] is preferred in the [[United States]] for the diagnosis of tuberculosis; multiple puncture tests, such as the Heaf test and [[Tine test]], are not recommended.
