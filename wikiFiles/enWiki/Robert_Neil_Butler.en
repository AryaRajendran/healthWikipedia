'''Robert Neil Butler''' (January 21, 1927 – July 4, 2010) was a [[physician]], [[gerontologist]], [[psychiatrist]], and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[author]], who was the first director of the [[National Institute on Aging]]. Butler is known for his work on the social needs and the rights of the elderly and for his research on [[healthy aging]] and the [[dementias]].

== Background ==
Having grown up with his grandparents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agingresearch.org/content/article/detail/915|title=Alliance for Aging Research}}</ref> Butler was shocked by the dismissive and contemptuous attitude toward the elderly and their
diseases by many of his teachers at [[medical school]], an attitude he later characterised as "[[ageism]]." <ref>Kramarae, C.  and Spender, D. (2000) ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge.'' Routledge. p. 29.</ref>

He graduated from [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], where he was editor of the [[Columbia Daily Spectator]] and a member of the [[Philolexian Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/jan_feb09/alumni_profiles0|title=Columbia College Today Alumni Profile}}</ref>

== Career ==
Butler was a principal investigator of one of the first [[interdisciplinary]], comprehensive, [[longitudinal studies]] of healthy community-residing older persons, conducted at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (1955-1966), which resulted in the landmark book ''Human Aging''. His research helped establish the fact that [[senility]] was not inevitable with [[aging]], but is a consequence of [[disease]].

In 1975, he became the founding Director <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/blsa/butler.htm|title=NIH Record}}</ref> of the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA) of the [[National Institutes of Health]], where he remained until 1982. At the National Institute on Aging he established [[Alzheimer's Disease]] as a national research priority. 

In 1982, he founded the Department of [[Geriatrics]] and Adult Development at [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine|The Mount Sinai Medical Center]], the first department of geriatrics in a [[United States]] [[medical school]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radioprimetime.org/specials/butler/index.htm|title=AARP Radio}}</ref> In addition, Butler helped found the Alzheimer's Disease Association, the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry, the American Federation for Aging Research and the Alliance for Aging Research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainhealth.utdallas.edu/about/research-advisory.html|title=Center for Brain Health}}</ref>

Butler was the founder, Chief Executive Officer, and President of the International Longevity Center-USA, a non-profit international organization created to educate people on how to live longer and better.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyOfficers?symbol=BTIM.A|title=Reuters}}</ref>

== Publications ==
Butler is best known for his 1975 book ''[[Why Survive? Being Old In America]]'', which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/General-Nonfiction|title=The Pulitzer Prizes General Non Fiction}}</ref> A 2003 paperback edition is currently available (ISBN 0-8018-7425-4).
