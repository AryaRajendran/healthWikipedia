'''Diisopropyl fluorophosphate''' ('''DFP''', '''DIFP''', '''diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate''') is an oily, colorless liquid with the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>FO<sub>3</sub>P. It is used in medicine {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and as an [[organophosphorus compounds|organophosphorus]] [[insecticide]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. It is stable, but undergoes hydrolysis when subjected to moisture, producing [[hydrofluoric acid]].
It is known also under names '''Difluorophate''', '''Diflupyl''', '''Diflurphate''', '''Dyflos''', '''Dyphlos''', '''Fluropryl''', '''Fluostigmine''', '''isofluorophate''', '''isofluorphate''', '''Neoglaucit''', '''PF-3''', '''PF3''', '''T-1703''', '''TL 466''', and others.

== Uses in medicine ==

Diisopropyl fluorophosphate is a parasympathomimetic drug "irreversible anti-cholinesterase" and has been used in [[ophthalmology]] as a [[miotic]] agent in treatment of chronic [[glaucoma]], as a miotic in veterinary medicine, and as an experimental agent in neuroscience because of its [[acetylcholinesterase]] [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitory]] properties and ability to induce [[Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy|delayed peripheral neuropathy]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. It is known as '''fluostigmine''' and '''Dyflos''' in such uses.

== Uses as toxin ==

[[Image:DIF reaction.png|thumb|250px|left|Reaction of the DIFP with a serine protease]]

The marked toxicity of esters of monofluorophosphoric acid was discovered in 1932, when [[Willy Lange]] and his PhD student Gerda von Krueger prepared the methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl esters and incidentally experienced their toxic effects. Another homologue of this series of esters, Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, was developed by British scientist [[Bernard Charles Saunders]]. On his search for compounds to be used as [[chemical warfare]] agents, Saunders was inspired by the report by Lange and Krueger and decided to prepare the new homologue which he labeled PF-3. It was much less effective as a chemical weapon than the G series agents. It was often mixed with [[mustard gas]], forming a more effective mixture with significantly lower melting point, resulting in an agent suitable for use in cold weather. [[Image:DFP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Protease-Inhibitor Complex.|Crystal structure of Herpes Simplex Virus Protease/Inhibitor (DFP) complex. The active site serine (yellow) has undergone phosphonylation resulting in irreversible inhibition.  Rendered from PDB [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1AT3 1AT3].]] In military research, due to its physical and chemical similarities and comparatively low toxicity, it is used as a simulant of [[G-agent]]s ([[tabun (nerve agent)|GA]], [[sarin|GB]], [[soman|GD]], [[cyclosarin|GF]]).

Diisopropyl fluorophosphate is a very potent [[neurotoxin]]. Its {{LD50}} in rats is 1.3&nbsp;mg/kg. It combines with the [[amino acid]] [[serine]] at the active site of the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]], an enzyme that deactivates the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]]. Neurotransmitters are needed to continue the passage of [[nerve impulse]]s from one [[neuron]] to another across the [[synapse]]. Once the impulse has been transmitted, acetylcholinesterase functions to deactivate the acetylcholine almost immediately by breaking it down. If the enzyme is inhibited, acetylcholine accumulates and nerve impulses cannot be stopped, causing prolonged muscle contraction. [[Paralysis]] occurs and [[death]] may result since the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|respiratory muscles]] are affected.

DFP also inhibits some proteases. It is a useful additive for protein or cell isolation procedure.

==Chemistry==
Isoflurophate, the di-iso-propyl ester of fluorophosphoric acid, is made by reacting [[isopropyl alcohol]] with [[phosphorus trichloride]], forming di-iso-propylphosphite, which is chlorinated and further reacted with [[sodium fluoride]] to replace the chlorine atom with fluorine, thus giving isofluorophate.
