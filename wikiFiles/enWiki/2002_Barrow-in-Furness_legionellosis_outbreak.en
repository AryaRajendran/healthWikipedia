The '''2002 Barrow-in-Furness Legionnaires' disease outbreak''' was a fatal outbreak of [[Legionellosis]] which occurred in [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]] it was and still remains the second worst outbreak of its kind in the country's history. 

The first fatality occurred on 2 August 2002.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2168893.stm Legionnaires' alert claims first victim]</ref> The source of the bacteria was later found to be from steam coming out of a badly maintained air conditioning unit. The system was located in the council-run arts centre [[Forum 28]], with the vent emitting the disease over a busy alleyway in the town centre. Ultimately seven people died and 172 cases were reported (a [[Case fatality|case fatality rate]] of around 4%), this makes it the 4th worst outbreak in the world in terms of number of cases and 6th worst in terms of deaths (see the [[List of Legionellosis outbreaks|List of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks]]).<ref>{{cite news | title = Legionnaires' source officially traced | publisher = BBC News | date = 2002-08-20 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2205186.stm | accessdate=2003-07-21 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20030814170447/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2205186.stm| archivedate= 14 August 2003 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
