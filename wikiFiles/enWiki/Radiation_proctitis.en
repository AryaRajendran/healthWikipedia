'''Radiation proctitis''' (and the related '''radiation colitis''') is [[inflammation]] and damage to the lower parts of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] after exposure to [[x-ray]]s or other [[ionizing radiation]] as a part of [[radiation therapy]]. Radiation proctitis most commonly occurs after treatment for [[cancer]]s such as [[cervical cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], and [[colon cancer]]. Radiation proctitis involves the lower [[intestine]], primarily the [[sigmoid colon]] and the [[rectum]].

==Classification==
Radiation proctitis can occur at two times after treatment:

*''Acute radiation proctitis'' &mdash; symptoms occur in the first few weeks after therapy. These symptoms include [[diarrhea]] and the urgent need to [[defecate]], often with pain while doing so ([[tenesmus]]). Acute radiation proctitis usually resolves without treatment after several months, but symptoms may improve with [[butyric acid|butyrate]] [[enema]]s.<ref name="pmid11072942">{{cite journal |author=Vernia P |title=Topical butyrate for acute radiation proctitis: randomised, crossover trial |journal=Lancet |volume=356 |issue=9237 |pages=1232–1235 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11072942 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02787-2|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673600027872 |author-separator=, |author2=Fracasso PL |author3=Casale V |display-authors=3 |last4=Villotti |first4=G |last5=Marcheggiano |first5=A |last6=Stigliano |first6=V |last7=Pinnaro |first7=P |last8=Bagnardi |first8=V |last9=Caprilli |first9=R}}</ref><ref name="pmid19107351">{{cite journal |author=Hille A |title=Sodium butyrate enemas in the treatment of acute radiation-induced proctitis in patients with prostate cancer and the impact on late proctitis.

*''Chronic radiation proctitis'' &mdash; symptoms may begin as early as several months after therapy but occasionally not until several years later. These symptoms include diarrhea, [[Hematochezia|rectal bleeding]], [[painful defecation]], and intestinal blockage. Intestinal blockage is a result of [[Stenosis|narrowing]] of the rectum which blocks the flow of [[feces]]. Connections ([[fistulae]]) may also develop between the colon and other parts of the body such as the [[skin]] or [[urinary system]]. Chronic radiation proctitis occurs in part because of damage to the [[blood vessel]]s which supply the colon. The colon is therefore deprived of [[oxygen]] and necessary [[nutrient]]s. Symptoms such as diarrhea and painful defecation may be treated with oral [[opioids]] and stool softeners, respectively. Complications such as obstruction and fistulae may require [[surgery]]. Several other methods are under development {{As of|2005|lc=on}} to lessen the effects of radiation proctitis. These include [[sucralfate]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], [[corticosteroid]]s, [[metronidazole]], [[argon plasma coagulation]], and [[radiofrequency ablation]].
