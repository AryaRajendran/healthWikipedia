'''Repressed memory''' is a condition where a [[memory]] has been unconsciously blocked by an individual due to the high level of stress or trauma contained in that memory.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Even though the individual cannot recall the memory, it may still be affecting them consciously.<ref name="childhood abuse">[http://www.apa.org/topics/trauma/memories.aspx?item=1 Questions and Answers about Memories of Childhood Abuse]</ref> 

The existence of repressed memories is a controversial topic in psychology; some studies have concluded that it can occur in victims of trauma while others dispute it. According to some psychologists, repressed memories can be recovered through therapy. Other psychologists argue that this is in fact rather a process through which false memories are created by blending actual memories and outside influences. Furthermore, some psychologists believe that repressed memories are considered a cultural symptom because there is no written proof of its existence before the 1800s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pettus|first=Ashley|title=cultural symptom? repressed memory|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/repressed-memory.html|work=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>  

According to the American Psychological Association, it is not currently possible to distinguish a true repressed memory from a false one without corroborating evidence.<ref name="childhood abuse" />
The term repressed memory is derived from the term dissociative amnesia, which is defined in the [[DSM-IV]] as “an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness”.<ref name="amnesia">{{cite web|title=Amnesia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/21119/amnesia|work=Encyclopedia Britannica online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> 

[[Amnesia]] is referred to any instance in which memories stored in the long-term memory are completely or partially forgotten, usually due to brain injury.<ref name="amnesia" /> 
According to proponents of the existence of repressed memories, they may sometimes be recovered years or decades after the event, most often spontaneously, triggered by a particular smell, taste, or other identifier related to the lost memory, or via suggestion during psychotherapy.<ref name="dissoc-9-4">{{cite journal|title=Memory recovery of childhood sexual abuse |last=Albach |first=Francine |coauthors=Peter Paul Moormann,  Bob Bermond |journal=Dissociation |volume= 9| issue =  4 |pages= 261–273 |id={{hdl|1794/1774}} |date=December-1996|issn=0896-2863}}</ref>

== History ==
There is no documented writing about repressed memories or sometimes referred to as, [[dissociative amnesia]], before the 1800s'.<ref>Pope H., et al. Psychol. Med., 37. 225 - 233 (2007).</ref>
The concept of repressed memory originated with [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1896 essay ''Zur Ätiologie der Hysterie'' ("On the etiology of hysteria").<ref name="freud">

One of the studies published in his essay involved a young woman by the name of Anna O. Among her many ailments, she suffered from stiff paralysis on the right side of her body. Freud stated her symptoms to be attached to psychological traumas. The painful memories had separated from her consciousness and has brought harm to her body. Freud used hypnosis to treat Anna O. She is reported to have gained slight mobility in her right side.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boag|first=Simon|title=Freudian Repression|year=2012|publisher=Karnac Books|location=London|isbn=9781855757387}}</ref> Freud's repressed memory theory joined his philosophy of [[psychoanalysis]]. Repressed memory has remained a heavily debated topic inside of Freud's psychoanalysis philosophy.

Van der Kolk and Fisler's research shows that traumatic memories are retrieved, at least at first, in the form of mental imprints that are dissociated. These imprints are of the affective and sensory elements of the traumatic experience. Clients have reported the slow emergence of a personal narrative that can be considered explicit (conscious) memory. The level of emotional significance of a memory correlates directly with the memory's veracity. Studies of subjective reports of memory show that memories of highly significant events are unusually accurate and stable over time.<ref name="pmid8564271">{{cite journal |author=van der Kolk BA, Fisler R |title=Dissociation and the fragmentary nature of traumatic memories: overview and exploratory study |journal=J Trauma Stress |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=505–25 |year=1995 |pmid=8564271 |doi= |url=http://www.trauma-pages.com/a/vanderk2.php | accessdate = 2008-03-22}}</ref> The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be qualitatively different from those of nontraumatic events.

Although research on repressed memory is limited, a few studies have suggested that memories of trauma that are forgotten and later recalled have a similar accuracy rate as trauma memories that had not been forgotten.<ref name=GL>{{cite journal | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1158280 | title = Ground lost: The false memory/recovered memory therapy debate | first = A | last = Scheflin | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | date = 1999-11-01 }}</ref>

One prominent proponent of the theory of repressed memory, and the usage of repressed memory in legal actions brought against alleged abusers, is [[Lenore Terr]], a controversial California psychiatrist who championed the notion that repressed memories can be suddenly resurrected by victims of abuse (such as childhood physical or sexual abuse) through exposure to visual or auditory stimuli. The [[U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] challenged Terr's theory, when applied to legal actions and remedies, as unreliable and inconsistent, and ultimately denied the admissibility of repressed memory as evidence in a judicial proceeding (Franklin v. Duncan, 1995).<ref>Victims of the State: George Franklin [http://www.victimsofthestate.org/CA/Franklin.htm www.victimsofthestate.org/CA/Franklin.htm]</ref><ref name="articles.sfgate.com">{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-11-21/news/17820388_1_appeals-court-george-franklin-repressed-memory-testimony | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Reynolds | last=Holding | title=Repressed Memory Case Ruling / Appeals court refuses to restore murder conviction | date=2011-06-23}}</ref><ref>[[Harry N.

There has also been significant questioning of the reality of repressed memories. There is considerable evidence that rather than being pushed out of consciousness, the difficulty with traumatic memories for most people are their intrusiveness and inability to forget.<ref>{{cite book | last = McHugh | first = PR | authorlink = Paul R.

Psychologists [[Elizabeth Loftus]] and Katherine Ketcham are authors of the seminal work on the fallacy of repressed memory, ''The Myth of Repressed Memory'' (St. Martin's Press, 1994).

For years Loftus was criticized and marginalized by her colleagues in psychology and psychiatry for her criticism and skepticism of repressed memory. In recent years her research is regarded as the most responsible approach to the controversy of repressed memory.<ref>Harry N. MacLean, "Repressed Memory Dealt a Serious Blow." http://www.harrymaclean.com/blog/tag/minnesota-supreme-court/</ref>

==Hypothesis==
It has been speculated that repression may be one method used by individuals to cope with traumatic memories, by pushing them out of awareness (perhaps as an adaptation via [[psychogenic amnesia]]) to allow a child to maintain [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to a person on whom they are dependent for survival.<ref name=Freyd2>{{cite journal |last=Freyd |first=J. |year=1994 |title=Betrayal trauma: traumatic amnesia as an adaptive response to childhood abuse |journal= Ethics & Behavior |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=307–330 |url=http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/freyd94.pdf |accessdate= 2008-01-13 |doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1|format=PDF}}</ref> Researchers have proposed that repression can operate on a social level as well.<ref name=Freyd3>{{cite journal |last= Freyd |first= Jennifer J. |year= 2007 |title= Archiving Dissociation as a Precaution Against Dissociating Dissociation |journal= Journal of Trauma & Dissociation |volume= 8 |issue= 3 |url= http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/freyd2007.pdf |accessdate= 2007-12-29|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Authenticity===

Memories ''can'' be accurate, but they are not ''always'' accurate. For example, eyewitness testimony even of relatively recent dramatic events is notoriously unreliable.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/107385802236964 | last1 = Gonsalves | first1 = B | last2 = Paller | first2 = KA | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2002 | title = Mistaken memories: remembering events that never happened | url = | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 391–5 | pmid = 12374423 }}</ref>  Misremembering results from confusion between memories for perceived and imagined events, which may result from overlap between particular features of the stored information comprising memories for perceived and imagined events. Memories of events are always a mix of factual traces of sensory information overlaid with emotions, mingled with interpretation and "filled in" with imaginings. Thus there is always skepticism about how valid a memory is as evidence of factual detail. Some believe that accurate memories of traumatic events are often repressed, but remain in the subconscious mind, from where they can be recovered by appropriate therapy. Others believe that truly traumatic events are never forgotten in this way, although often people may not disclose their memories to others. This is a difficult area to study, and unambiguous conclusions are hard to draw, hence there continue to be very divergent opinions. In one study where victims of documented child abuse were reinterviewed many years later as adults, a high proportion of the women denied any memory of the abuse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams LM  |title=Recall of childhood trauma: a prospective study of women's memories of  child sexual abuse |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=62 |issue=6  |pages=1167–76  |year=1994 |pmid=7860814 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.62.6.1167|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/courses/2004-05/winter/psy130/Debate2Williams1.pdf}}</ref> 

Those who doubt the existence of "traumatic amnesia" note that  various manipulations can be used to implant false memories (sometimes called "pseudomemories"). These can be quite compelling for those who develop them, and can include details that make them seem credible to others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Laney | first1 = C | last2 = Loftus | first2 = EF | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2005 | title = Traumatic memories are not necessarily accurate memories | url = | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 13| pages = 823–8 | pmid = 16483115 }}</ref> A classic experiment in  memory research, conducted by [[Elizabeth Loftus]], became widely known as "Lost in the Mall"; in this, subjects were given a booklet containing three accounts of real childhood events written by family members and a fourth account of a wholly fictitious event of being lost in a shopping mall. A quarter of the subjects reported remembering the fictitious event, and elaborated on it with extensive circumstantial detail.<ref>See Loftus E (1997) Creating false memories ''Scientific American'' 227 no 3 for a popular account</ref> This experiment inspired many others, and in one of these, Porter ''et al.''  could convince about half of his subjects that they had survived a vicious animal attack in childhood.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1022344128649 | last1 = Porter | first1 = S | author-separator =, | last2 = Yuille | author-name-separator= | year = 1999 | first2 = JC | last3 = Lehman | first3 = DR | title = The nature of real, implanted, and fabricated memories for emotional childhood events: implications for the recovered memory debate | url = | journal = Law Hum Behav | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 517–37 | pmid = 10487147 }}</ref>

When memories are 'recovered' after long periods of amnesia, particularly when extraordinary means were used to secure the recovery of memory, it is now widely (but not universally) accepted that the memories are quite likely to be false, i.e. of incidents that had not occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1192/bjp.172.4.296 | last1 = Brandon | first1 = S | author-separator =, | last2 = Boakes | author-name-separator=  | first2 = J| year = 1998 | last3 = Glaser | first3 = D | last4 = Green | first4 = R | title = Recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse.

The ''American Psychiatric Association'' advises that "...most leaders in the field agree that although it is a rare occurrence, a memory of early childhood abuse that has been forgotten can be remembered later. However, these leaders also agree that it is possible to construct convincing pseudomemories for events that never occurred. The mechanism(s) by which both of these phenomena happen are not well understood and, at this point it is impossible, without other corroborative evidence, to distinguish a true memory from a false one."<ref>[http://www.apa.org/topics/memories.html Questions and Answers about Memories of Childhood Abuse] ''American Psychiatric Association''</ref><ref>Sheflin and Brown state that a total of 25 studies on amnesia for child sexual abuse exist and that they demonstrate amnesia in their study subpopulations. {{cite journal | last = Sheflin | first = AW | coauthors = Brown D |year=1996 | title = Repressed memory or dissociative amnesia: what the science says | journal = J Psychiat Law | volume = 24  | pages = 143–88 | issn = 0093-1853 =}}.

Brown ''et al.'' estimate that 3 to 5% of laboratory subjects are vulnerable to post-event misinformation suggestions. They state that 5 - 8% of the general population is the range of high-hypnotizability. Twenty-five percent of those in this range are vulnerable to suggestion of pseudomemories for peripheral details, which can rise to 80% with a combination of other social influence factors. They conclude that the rates of memory errors run 0 - 5% in adult studies, 3 - 5% in children's studies and that the rates of false allegations of child abuse allegations run 4 - 8% in the general population.<ref name=Hammond/>

===Neurological basis of memory===

The neuroscientist [[Donald Hebb]] (1904–1985) was the first to distinguish between [[short-term memory]] and [[long-term memory]]. According to current theories in neuroscience, things that we "notice" are stored in short-term memory for up to a few minutes; this memory depends on 'reverberating' electrical activity in neuronal circuits, and is very easily destroyed by interruption or interference. Memories stored for longer than this are stored in ''long-term memory''. Whether information is stored in long-term memory depends on its 'importance'; for any animal, memories of traumatic events are potentially important for the adaptive value that they have for future avoidance behaviour, and [[hormones]] that are released during stress have a role in determining what memories are preserved. In humans, traumatic stress is associated with acute secretion of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] (adrenaline and noradrenaline) from the [[adrenal medulla]] and [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal cortex]]. Increases in these facilitate memory, but chronic stress associated with prolonged hypersecretion of cortisol may have the opposite effect. The [[limbic system]] is involved in memory storage and retrieval as well as giving emotional significance to sensory inputs. Within the limbic system, the [[hippocampus]] is important for [[explicit memory]], and for [[memory consolidation]]; it is also sensitive to stress hormones, and has a role in recording the emotions of a stressful event.

Although memory distortion occurs in everyday life, the brain mechanisms involved are not easy to study in the laboratory, but [[neuroimaging]] techniques have recently been applied to this subject. In particular, there have recently been studies of false recognition, where individuals incorrectly claim to have encountered a novel object or event, and the results suggest that the hippocampus and several cortical regions may contribute to such false recognition, while the prefrontal cortex may be involved in retrieval monitoring that can limit the rate of false recognition.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schacter | first1 = DL | last2 = Slotnick | first2 = SD | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2004 | title = The cognitive neuroscience of memory distortion | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 149–60 | pmid = 15450167 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.08.017}}</ref>

===Amnesia===
[[Amnesia]] is partial or complete loss of memory that goes beyond mere forgetting. Often it is temporary and involves only part of a person's experience. Amnesia is often caused by an injury to the brain, for instance after a blow to the head, and sometimes by psychological trauma. [[Anterograde amnesia]] is a failure to remember new experiences that occur after damage to the brain; [[retrograde amnesia]] is the loss of memories of events that occurred before a trauma or injury. For a memory to become permanent (consolidated), there must be a persistent change in the strength of connections between particular neurons in the brain. Anterograde amnesia can occur because this consolidation process is disrupted; retrograde amnesia can result either from damage to the site of memory storage or from a disruption in the mechanisms by which memories can be retrieved from their stores. Many specific types of amnesia are recognized, including:
* [[Childhood amnesia]] is the normal inability to recall memories from the first three years of life. Sigmund Freud was the first to observe this phenomenon and realized that not only do humans not remember anything from birth to three years, but they also have “spotty” recollection of anything occurring from three to seven years of age.<ref>Josselyn, S. A., & Frankland, P. W. (2012). Infantile amnesia: A neurogenic hypothesis. Learning & Memory, 19(9), 423-433. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/lm.021311.110</ref> There are various theories as to why this occurs: some believe that language development is important for efficient storage of long-term memories; others believe that early memories do not persist because the brain is still developing.
* A [[fugue state]], formally dissociative fugue, is a rare condition precipitated by a stressful episode. It is characterized by episode(s) of traveling away from home and creating a new identity.<ref>Loewenstein, R. J. (1991). [http://books.google.se/books?id=Q42BA_s45_8C&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=Psychogenic+amnesia+and+psychogenic+fugue:+A+comprehensive+review&source=bl&ots=-M4MbTcK3r&sig=3UJAbtt2ArWsJ2yYeYH5OGcKJC0&hl=sv&sa=X&ei=tnViUf7xOYjx4QTK8YGoBg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Psychogenic%20amnesia%20and%20psychogenic%20fugue%3A%20A%20comprehensive%20review&f=false Psychogenic amnesia and psychogenic fugue: A comprehensive review.] (pp. 189-222). Arlington, VA, US: American Psychiatric Association, Arlington, VA.</ref>
The form of amnesia that is linked with recovered memories is dissociative amnesia (formerly known as psychogenic amnesia). This results from a psychological cause, not by direct damage to the brain, and is a loss of memory of significant personal information, usually about traumatic or extremely stressful events. Usually this is seen as a gap or gaps in recall for aspects of someone's life history, but with severe acute trauma, such as during wartime, there can be a sudden acute onset of symptoms.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&dq=Diagnostic+and+Statistical+Manual+of+Mental+Disorders,&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=yq3MSd7vAcPRjAf2y7XTCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA520,M1 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]</ref>

===Effects of trauma on memory===

'Betrayal Trauma Theory' proposes that in cases of  childhood abuse, dissociative amnesia is an adaptive response, and that “victims may need to remain unaware of the trauma not to reduce suffering but rather to promote survival.”<ref>{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1  | last = Freyd| first =  J| year = 1994| title = Betrayal trauma: Traumatic amnesia as an adaptive response to childhood abuse  | journal = Ethics Behav  | volume = 4

When stress interferes with memory, it is possible that some of the memory is kept by a system that records emotional experience, but there is no symbolic placement of it in time or space.<ref name=Vander1994>{{Cite journal  | last = van der Kolk |first=Bessel| year = 1994| title = The body keeps the score: memory and the evolving psychobiology of posttraumatic stress| journal = Harvard Rev Psychiat | volume = 1| pages =253–65| doi = 10.3109/10673229409017088  | url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/Homepage/Class/Psy394U/Bower/03%20Emot,%20Trauma,Mem/Body%20keeps%20the%20score.%20Kolk%20.pdf  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Traumatic memories are retrieved, at least at first, in the form of dissociated mental imprints of the affective and sensory elements of the traumatic experience. Clients have reported the slow emergence of a personal narrative that can be considered explicit (conscious) memory. 

Psychiatrist [[Bessel van der Kolk]]<ref name=Van1995/> divided the effects of traumas on memory functions into four sets
*[[traumatic amnesia]]; this involves the loss of memories of traumatic experiences. The younger the subject and the longer the traumatic event is, the greater the chance of significant amnesia. He stated that subsequent retrieval of memories after traumatic amnesia is well documented in the literature, with documented examples following natural disasters and accidents, in combat soldiers, in victims of kidnapping, torture and concentration camp experiences, in victims of physical and sexual abuse, and in people who have committed murder.
*global [[Memory disorder|memory impairment]]; this makes it difficult for subjects to construct an accurate account of their present and past history.  "The combination of lack of autobiographical memory, continued dissociation and of meaning schemes that include victimization, helplessness and betrayal, is likely to make these individuals vulnerable to suggestion and to the construction of explanations for their trauma-related affects that may bear little relationship to the actual realities of their lives"
*[[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative processes]]; this refers to memories being stored as fragments and not as unitary wholes.
*traumatic memories’ [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] organization. Not being able to integrate traumatic memories seems to be linked to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).<ref>Diagnostic symptoms of PTSD include reexperience such as flashbacks and nightmares, difficulty falling or staying asleep, feelings of panic or fear, depression, headache, and physiological symptoms including irregular heartbeat and diarrhoea.[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfoforall/problems/posttraumaticstressdisorder/posttraumaticstressdisorder.aspx  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)] The Royal College of Psychiatrists</ref>

According to van der Kolk, memories of highly significant events are usually accurate and stable over time; aspects of traumatic experiences appear to get stuck in the mind, unaltered by time passing or experiences that may follow. The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be different from those of nontraumatic events, perhaps because of alterations in attentional focusing or the fact that extreme emotional arousal interferes with  memory.<ref name=Van1995>{{Cite journal| last1 = van der Kolk| first1 = BA| last2 = Fisler| first2 = R| year = 1995| title = Dissociation and the fragmentary nature of traumatic memories: Overview and exploratory study| journal = J Traumatic Stress| volume = 8| pages = 505–25| url =http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/~peterson/psy430s2001/Van%20der%20Kolk%20Fragmentary%20Nature%20of%20Traumatic%20Memory%20J%20Traumatic%20Stress%201995.pdf| postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref> van der Kolk and Fisler's hypothesis is that under extreme stress, the memory categorization system based in the hippocampus fails, with these memories kept as emotional and sensory states.  When these traces are remembered and put into a personal narrative, they are subject to being condensed, contaminated and embellished upon.   

When there is inadequate recovery time between stressful situations, alterations may occur to the [[stress response]] system, some of which may be irreversible, and cause pathological responses, which may include memory loss, learning deficits and other maladaptive symptoms. In animal studies, high levels of [[cortisol]] can cause hippocampal damage, which may cause short-term memory deficits; in humans, MRI studies have shown reduced hippocampal volumes in combat veterans with PTSD, adults with posttraumatic symptoms and survivors of repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse. Trauma may also interfere with implicit memory, where periods of avoidance may be interrupted by intrusive emotional occurrences with no story to guide them. A difficult issue is whether those presumably abused accurately recall their experiences.<ref name=Bremner2002>{{Cite book| last = Bremner| first =  JD| year = 2002| title = Does Stress Damage the Brain?

Many critics believe that memories may be distorted and false. Psychologist [[Elizabeth Loftus]] questions the concept of repressed memories and their possibility of them being accurate. Loftus focuses on techniques that therapists use in order to help the patients recover their memory. Such techniques include age regression, guided visualization, trance writing, dream work, body work, and hypnosis.
Loftus' research indicates that repressed memory faces problems, such as memory alteration. In one case a teenage boy was able to “conjure a memory of an event that never occurred.” According to Loftus, if a stable person could be influenced to remember an event that never occurred, an emotionally stressed person would be even more susceptible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth|title=The Reality of Repressed Memories|journal=American Psychologist|date=May 1993|year=1993|volume=48|issue=1|pages=518–537}}</ref>

===Medico-legal issues===

Serious issues arise when recovered but false memories result in public allegations; false complaints carry serious consequences for the accused. Many of those who make false claims sincerely believe the truth of what they report. A special type of false allegation, the [[false memory syndrome]], arises typically within therapy, when people report the 'recovery' of childhood memories of previously unknown abuse. The influence of practitioners' beliefs and practices in the eliciting of false 'memories' and of false complaints has come under particular criticism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boakes | first1 = J | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1999 | title = False complaints of sexual assault: recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse | url = | journal = Med Sci Law | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 112–20 | pmid = 10332158 }}</ref>
Sometimes these memories are used as evidence in criminal prosecutions. 

It is generally accepted that people sometimes are unable to recall traumatic experiences. The current version (DSM-IV) of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', published by the ''American Psychiatric Association'', states that "Dissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness."<ref>Section 300.12:[http://psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV.aspx DSM-IV] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, American Psychiatric Association

== Legal issues ==
Some criminal cases have been based on a witness's testimony of recovered repressed memories, often of alleged childhood sexual abuse. In some jurisdictions, the [[statute of limitations]] for child abuse cases has been extended to accommodate the phenomena of repressed memories as well as other factors.  The repressed memory concept came into wider public awareness in the 1980s and 1990s followed by a reduction of public attention after a series of scandals, lawsuits, and license revocations.<ref name=Robbins>Robbins Susan P., The Social and Cultural Context of Satanic Ritual Abuse Allegations, published in [[Institute for Psychological Therapies]] magazine, vol 10 1998.[http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume10/j10_8.htm]</ref>

Alan Scheflin, a law professor, stated in 1999, "Both those who argue that repressed memories are always false and those who argue that repressed memories are always true [...] appear to be mistaken. Although the science is limited on this issue, the only three relevant studies conclude that repressed memories are no more and no less accurate than continuous memories....”<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Scheflin | first = A  | year = 1999  | title = Ground lost: the false memory/recovered memory therapy debate  | journal = Psychiatric Times  | volume = 16 | url =http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1158280  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In July, 2012, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that repressed memory is not acceptable as evidence in a legal action and is the equivalent of superstition, hearsay or "junk science."<ref>"Minn.

Duncan Court Order http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3066228776991890480</ref> that repressed memory is not admissible as evidence in a legal action because of its unreliability, inconsistency, unscientific nature, tendency to be therapeutically induced evidence, and subject to influence by hearsay and suggestibility.

==Professional organizations==

The ''Working Group on Investigation of Memories of Child Abuse'' of the American Psychological Association presented findings mirroring those of the other professional organizations (see External Links subpage for references to various statements made independently by these organisations). The Working Group made five key conclusions:

#Controversies regarding adult recollections should not be allowed to obscure the fact that child sexual abuse is a complex and pervasive problem in America that has historically gone unacknowledged;
#Most people who were sexually abused as children remember all or part of what happened to them;
#It is possible for memories of abuse that have been forgotten for a long time to be remembered;
#It is also possible to construct convincing pseudo-memories for events that never occurred; and
#There are gaps in our knowledge about the processes that lead to accurate and inaccurate recollections of childhood abuse.<ref>Colangelo JJ (2007)
