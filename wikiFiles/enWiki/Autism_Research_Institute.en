The '''Autism Research Institute''' (ARI), established in 1967 by [[Bernard Rimland]], Ph.D., is a [[San Diego, California]], based [[nonprofit]] that serves primarily as a resource for information on [[autism]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders. Stephen M. Edelson, Ph.D. became the director of ARI upon Rimland's death in 2006.

==History==
ARI was founded in 1967 by [[Bernard Rimland]], Ph.D, a research psychologist. Rimland’s book Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior was published in 1964. Rimland was the first to authoritatively challenge the prevailing theory of the time, the [[refrigerator mother theory]] (that autism was caused by unloving mothers), by providing evidence that autism is a biological disorder. He founded ARI to promote [[Applied Behavior Analysis]] as an intervention for autism.<ref>[http://autism.com/ari/newsletter/133/page3.pdf Bernard Rimland, Ph.D., on the ABA controversy]</ref> Today, ARI continues to seek out science-based autism treatments by:<ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/about-ari ARI's work]</ref>

==Treatments==
In an interview with About.com, ARI Director Steve Edelson said “if a practitioner claims to ‘cure’ autism, run in the other direction.”<ref>[http://autism.about.com/od/treatmentoptions/a/DANQandA.htm Biomedical Treatments for Autism from the Autism Research Institute]</ref> ARI’s focus is on evidence-based treatments. To that end, the ARI website links to numerous scientific studies that have found improvements in autism symptoms through various dietary treatments such as a [[ketogenic diet]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=22101998 |year=2011 |last1=Jóźwiak |first1=S |last2=Kossoff |first2=EH |last3=Kotulska-Jóźwiak |first3=K |title=Dietary treatment of epilepsy: Rebirth of an ancient treatment |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=370–8 |journal=Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska}}</ref> vitamin/mineral supplementation<ref name="Adams2011">{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2431-11-111 |title=Effect of a vitamin/mineral supplement on children and adults with autism |year=2011 |last1=Adams |first1=James B |last2=Audhya |first2=Tapan |last3=McDonough-Means |first3=Sharon |last4=Rubin |first4=Robert A |last5=Quig |first5=David |last6=Geis |first6=Elizabeth |last7=Gehn |first7=Eva |last8=Loresto |first8=Melissa |last9=Mitchell |first9=Jessica |journal=BMC Pediatrics |volume=11 |page=111 |pmid=22151477 |pmc=3266205}}</ref> and a gluten-free/casein-free diet.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1179/147683010X12611460763922 |title=The ScanBrit randomised, controlled, single-blind study of a gluten- and casein-free dietary intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders |year=2010 |last1=Whiteley |first1=Paul |last2=Haracopos |first2=Demetrious |last3=Knivsberg |first3=Ann-Mari |last4=Reichelt |first4=Karl Ludvig |last5=Parlar |first5=Sarah |last6=Jacobsen |first6=Judith |last7=Seim |first7=Anders |last8=Pedersen |first8=Lennart |last9=Schondel |first9=Maja |journal=Nutritional Neuroscience |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=87–100 |pmid=20406576}}</ref>

ARI is a major proponent of the biomedical approach for autism treatment,<ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/ed_recovery Biomedical Approach and Autism]</ref> compiling evidence from autism research experts and parents to share information about the most viable treatments for common autism symptoms. The premise for integrative medical intervention is that certain neurological disorders, including autism, might be caused by environmental triggers that compromise the gastrointestinal, immunological, and neurological systems;<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/book/209801/the-autism-revolution-by-dr-martha-herbert-and-karen-weintraub#excerpt Autism's impact on gastrointestinal, immunological, and neurological systems]{{page needed|date=March 2012}}</ref> gastrointestinal, in that those with autism tend toward constipation and/or diarrhea and often have abnormal cravings or abhorrence for certain kinds of food; immunological, in that many have poor regulation of the immune system; and decreased ability to fight infectious diseases, and some are prone to allergies; and neurological, in that hypo- or hypersensitive to sensory impressions is very common. Proponents of integrative medical intervention claim that children with autism generally improve the health of all three systems with an adapted or 'special' diet, or with the addition to their diet of certain dietary supplements, nutrients, and enzyme supplements. Based on this premise, what is often diagnosed as autism or PDD is seen as a physiological syndrome involving many parts of the body that could be treated as a physiological disorder.

ARI is also a longtime supporter of Applied Behavior Analysis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autism.com/fam_page.asp?PID=315 |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |publisher=Autism.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> believing ABA should complement other autism interventions. 

Controversial treatments/issues and ARI’s position today:
*Vaccines – ARI supports safe vaccination. Research on this topic is ongoing and ARI continue to track new developments in this field of study, among others. The organization continues to seek potential trigger factors for autism.<ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/about_ari_faq FAQs about ARI]</ref>
*Chelation – Chelation is not a “cure” for autism. If, in the opinion of a medical doctor, the patient has an unusual heavy-metal burden, chelation might be warranted, just as it would be for a patient who does not have autism. Additional research is needed to investigate the prevalence and underlying reasons for impaired excretion of environmental toxins, and to determine effective treatments.<ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/about_ari_faq ARI FAQ]</ref>
*Gluten-free, casein-free diets – ARI believes that this diet can be beneficial. While a study by the University of Rochester found "eliminating gluten and casein from the diets of children with autism had no impact on their behavior, sleep or bowel patterns,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=2860 |title=Study finds gluten-free, casein-free diet has no impact |publisher=Urmc.rochester.edu |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> a study by the University of Sunderland in the U.K. found that gluten-free, casein-free “dietary intervention may positively affect developmental outcome for some children diagnosed with ASD.”<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1362361399003001005 |title=A Gluten-Free Diet as an Intervention for Autism and Associated Spectrum Disorders: Preliminary Findings |year=1999 |last1=Whiteley |first1=P. |last2=Rodgers |first2=J. |last3=Savery |first3=D. |last4=Shattock |first4=P. |journal=Autism |volume=3 |page=45}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2012}}</ref>
*Based on empirical evidence and research, ARI asserts that pharmaceutical treatments should be approached with caution, as many can exacerbate some symptoms while treating others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autism.com/pro_adversereactions.asp |title=Adverse reactions of pharmaceutical treatments |publisher=Autism.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref>

==Research==
ARI has awarded more than $1.5 million in research grants since 2009. Grant recipients include Harvard/Mass General, Cleveland Clinic, UCLA, Arizona State University, UC Davis, and Columbia University.<ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/about_2010_funded ARI-Funded Research Studies]</ref> ARI also funds Tissue Banks for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the University of Maryland <ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/about_tissue ARI and NICHD Tissue Bank]</ref> and the Digestive Function Laboratory Repository at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston; a specimen bank for non-autistic individuals to provide proper comparison controls for researchers is in development.

==Conference==
ARI holds that autism can be treated through a combination of intensive behavior modification, such as Applied Behavior Analysis,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.01.008 |title=Applied behavior analytic intervention for autism in early childhood: Meta-analysis, meta-regression and dose–response meta-analysis of multiple outcomes |year=2010 |last1=Virués-Ortega |first1=Javier |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=387–99 |pmid=20223569}}</ref> and a wide variety of biomedical interventions, primarily the use of dietary supplements<ref name="Adams2011" /> and special diets. To this end, they sponsor a yearly conference (once known as Defeat Autism Now!/DAN!), known as the ARI Conference, of researchers, scientists, and physicians. ARI ended the registry of DAN doctors in 2011.<ref>[http://www.autism.com/index.php/ed_movingforward ARI Moving Forward]</ref>

ARI also sponsors the annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR). First convened in 2001, the first and primary aim of the meeting is to promote exchange and dissemination of the latest scientific findings and to stimulate research progress in understanding the nature, cause and treatments of ASD. The meeting also promotes training for pre/post doctorates to advance research of ASD. The ISAR publishes the Autism Research Journal.<ref>[http://www.autisminsar.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=251&Itemid=191 Autism Research Journal]</ref>

==Publications==
*ARI e-newsletter: free monthly newsletter for families and caregivers
*Autism Research Review International (ARRI): quarterly print review of autism research ($20 for a one-year subscription, $24 if outside the U.S.)

==Affiliates==
*Autistic Global Initiative (AGI) – AGI is an ARI program staffed by adults with autism who are committed to increasing quality infrastructure for adults with ASD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autismwebsite.com/agi/ |title=Support for adults with autism |publisher=Autismwebsite.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref>
*The Global Autism Alliance, a partnership created in response to a global need for networking, communicating, and collaborating among autism groups. This program is housed at ARI; Stephen M. Edelson, ARI director, is the president.

==Funding==
ARI is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Almost all ARI operations and initiatives are funded by private donations. Over 80 cents of every dollar donated to ARI goes directly to programs and research projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org |title=ARI's record on Charity Navigator |publisher=Charitynavigator.org |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref>
