'''One Health''' has been defined as "the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines — working locally, nationally, and globally — to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment".<ref>The American Veterinary Medical Association.

==Background==

One Health is a new phrase, but the concept extends back to ancient times. The recognition that environmental factors can impact human health can be traced as far back as to the [[greece|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) in his text [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/Περὶ_ἀέρων,_ὑδάτων,_τόπων "On Airs, Waters, and Places"]. He promoted the concept that public health depended on a clean environment.<ref>The Internet Classics Archive. Hippocrates. "On Airs, Waters, and Places". 400 BCE. Translated by Francis Adams. http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.html. Accessed September 1, 2011.</ref> 

The [[italy|Italian]] physician [[Giovanni Maria Lancisi]] (1654–1720) was a pioneering epidemiologist, physician, and veterinarian, with a fascination in the role the physical environment played in the spread of disease in humans and animals. Lancisi may have been the first to advocate the use of mosquito nets for prevention of malaria in humans<ref>Drake D. A practical treatise on the history, prevention, and treatment of epidemic cholera, designed both for the profession and the people. Cincinnati, Corey and Fairbank, 1832.</ref> but was also a pioneer in the control of [[rinderpest]] in cattle. The idea that human, animal and environmental healths are linked was further revived during the [[france|French]] Revolution by D<sup>rs</sup> Louis-René Villerme (1782–1863) and {{link-interwiki|en=Alexandre Parent du Châtelet|en_text=Alexandre Parent-Duchâtelet|lang=fr|lang_title=Alexandre Parent du Châtelet}} (1790–1835) who developed the specialty of public hygiene.<ref>A. F. LaBerge. "Mission and Method. The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement." Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1992.</ref>

In the late 19th century, German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) coined the term "zoonosis", and said "...between animal and human medicine there are no dividing lines – nor should there be". Canadian physician Sir William Osler (1849–1919) traveled to [[Germany]] to study with Virchow. He returned to [[Canada]] and held joint faculty appointments at the McGill University Medical School and the Montreal Veterinary College.<ref>Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Steele JH.

In 1947, James H. Steele, DVM ([[Doctor of veterinary medicine]]), furthered the concept in the [[USA|U.S.]] by establishing the field of veterinary public health at the [[United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]].<ref>Waddy J.

The 1999 West Nile virus outbreak in New York City highlighted the links between human and animal health.

The avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) epidemic that began in Hong Kong in 1997 forced the global community to recognize that animal health and human health are linked.

==Comparative medicine==

Animals suffer from many of the same chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, asthma, and arthritis as humans.  Sometimes a disease entity is recognized in animals long before it is recognized in humans. For example, fear-induced heart failure was described in wildlife about thirty years before it was recognized in humans.<ref>JAVMA News. One Health Wonders. October 1, 2008. https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/081001h.aspx. Accessed December 4, 2012.</ref> Comparative medicine is the study of disease processes across species and is based on the study of naturally occurring diseases of animals that also afflict humans.  The concept of comparative medicine is very old. The ancient Greeks understood that dissecting and studying animals could yield important clues to understanding human diseases.<ref>Olsson S-E. Comparative Orthopaedics. ''Clin Orthop Related Res'' 1969; 62: 3-5.</ref> From Galen to William Harvey, comparative anatomical and physiological studies have been responsible for significant advances in medicine; Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin through such work.<ref>Lyons AS, Petrucelli RJ. "Medicine: An Illustrated History." 1978. Abradale Press, New York.</ref> 

The musculoskeletal system is particularly well-suited to comparative medicine studies since acute and chronic disorders of bones and joints have the same counterparts in humans and animals. Information gained from one species can be directly translated to another, thereby advancing the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. Since the early 1930s, comparative orthopaedic research has incorporated the One Health concept. Otto Stader, a small animal veterinarian, used a comparative medicine approach and developed the first form of external skeletal fixation, the Stader splint, as a way to stabilize fractures in dogs.  During World War II, Navy surgeons improved the treatment of fractures in sailors by incorporating Stader's advances. During the 1940s and 50's, Jacques Jenny, a veterinary surgeon, performed one of the first intra-medullary pinning procedures in animals and significantly advanced fracture repair strategies in horses and humans. In 1966, Sten-Erik Olsson VMD, MD and John L. Marshall DVM, MD, both of whom had medical and veterinary medical degrees, founded the first laboratory dedicated to comparative orthopaedic research at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. In the 21st century, comparative orthopaedic laboratories are located throughout the world and use both a comparative and translational research approach in an effort to improve diagnostic capabilities, enhance preventive and therapeutic strategies, and advance the understanding of disease mechanisms. Advances in fracture fixation, total joint replacement, and cartilage repair are a few examples of how knowledge flows in both directions, to benefit both human and animal health.<ref>Cook JL, Arnoczky SP.

Veterinarians are also turning to environmental health scientists and practitioners to prevent and control outbreaks and public health emergencies. One Health is the perfect unifying concept to bring together human health care practitioners, veterinarians, and public health professionals under the umbrella of environmental health. By strengthening epidemiologic and laboratory investigations that assess the role of environmental influences, this partnership can help to develop and apply sustainable and effective community health interventions.
