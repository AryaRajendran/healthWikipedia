An '''insecticide''' is a [[pesticide]] used against [[insect]]s. They include ovicides and [[larvicides]] used against the [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[larva]]e of insects respectively. Insecticides are used in [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[industry]], and general home use. The use of insecticides is believed to be one of the major factors behind the increase in agricultural productivity in the 20th century.<ref>van Emden HF, Pealall DB (1996) ''Beyond Silent Spring'', Chapman & Hall, London, 322pp.</ref>  Nearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems; many are toxic to humans; and others are concentrated in the food chain.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The classification of insecticides is done in several different ways:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
*''Systemic'' insecticides are incorporated by treated plants. Insects ingest the insecticide while feeding on the plants.
*''Contact'' insecticides are toxic to insects brought into direct contact. Efficacy is often related to the quality of [[pesticide application]], with small droplets (such as [[aerosol]]s) often improving performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dropdata.org |title=dropdata.org |publisher=dropdata.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-05}}</ref>
*''Natural'' insecticides, such as [[nicotine]], [[pyrethrum]] and [[neem]] extracts are made by plants as defenses against insects. Nicotine-based insecticides are still being widely used in the US and Canada though they are barred in the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/insect-mite/mevinphos-propargite/nicotine/nicotine_tol_1201.html |title=nicotine Proposed Revocation of Tolerances 12/01 |publisher=Pmep.cce.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-05}}</ref>
*''Plant-incorporated protectants'' (PIPs) are insecticidal substances produced by plants after [[Genetically modified organism|genetic modification]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/pips/index.htm Plant Incorporated Protectants]</ref>  For instance, a gene that codes for a specific ''Baccilus thuringiensis'' biocidal protein is introduced into a crop plant's genetic material. Then, the plant manufactures the protein.  Since the biocide is incorporated into the plant, additional applications, at least of the same compound, are not required.
*''Inorganic'' insecticides are manufactured with metals and include [[arsenate]]s, [[copper]] compounds and [[fluorine]] compounds, which are now seldom used, and [[sulfur]], which is commonly used.
*''Organic'' insecticides are synthetic chemicals which comprise the largest numbers of pesticides available for use today.
*''[[Mode of action]]''—how the pesticide kills or inactivates a pest—is another way of classifying insecticides. Mode of action is important in predicting whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as fish, birds and mammals.

==Classes of insecticides==

===Organochlorides===

The insecticidal properties of the best known representative of this class of insecticides, [[DDT]], was made by the Swiss Scientist [[Paul Müller]]. For this discovery, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite web | author=Karl Grandin, ed. | title=Paul Müller Biography | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/muller-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | year=1948 | accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>  DDT was introduced on the market in 1944. The contemporary rise of the chemical industry facilitated the large-scale production of DDT and related [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]]s. DDT functions by opening the [[sodium channels]] in the nerve cells of the insect.<ref>{{cite web | author=Vijverberg et al. | title=Similar mode of action of pyrethroids and DDT on sodium channel gating in myelinated nerves | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v295/n5850/abs/295601a0.html | journal=Nature | issue=295 | year=1982 | accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref>

===Organophosphates and carbamates===
Another large class of synthetic insecticides are the [[organophosphate]]s.  Again these target the insect's nervous system.  Organophosphates interfere with the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases, disrupting nerve impulses, killing or disabling the insect. Organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (such as [[sarin]], [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[soman]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]) work in the same way.  Organophosphates have an accumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity.<ref name="palmerw"/>

[[Carbamate]] insecticides have similar toxic mechanisms to organophosphates, but have a much shorter duration of action and are thus somewhat less toxic.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Pyrethroids===

To mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound [[pyrethrum]] another class of pesticides, [[pyrethroid]] pesticides, has been developed. These compounds are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators, and are much less acutely toxic than organophosphates and carbamates.  Compounds in this group are often [[Pesticide application|applied against household pests]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Class, Thomas J. and Kintrup J. | title=Pyrethroids as household insecticides: analysis, indoor exposure and persistence. | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vr811u2011354715/ | journal=Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry | issue=340| year=1991| accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref>

===Neonicotinoids===
[[Neonicotinoid]]s are synthetic analogues of the natural insecticide [[nicotine]] (with a much lower acute mammalian toxicity and greater field persistence). These chemicals are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. Broad-spectrum—systemic insecticides, they have a rapid action (minutes-hours). They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and [[soil]] treatments—often as substitutes for organophosphates and carbamates. Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, stylet withdrawal (aphids), disoriented movement, paralysis and death.<ref>[http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pi117 Fishel,F.M. 2009. Pesticide Toxicity Profile: Neonicotinoid Pesticides IFAS Publication #PI-80]</ref>  Imidacloprid may be the most commonly used neonicotinoid.  It has recently come under scrutiny for its deleterious effects on honeybees,<ref>[http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/feb/19/insecticides-taking-toll-on-honeybees/ Insecticides taking toll on honeybees]</ref> and its potential to increase the susceptibility of rice to planthopper attacks.<ref>[http://scienceindex.com/stories/2068471/Possible_connection_between_imidaclopridinduced_changes_in_rice_gene_transcription_profiles_and_susceptibility_to_the_brown_plant_hopperNilaparvatalugensStl_Hemiptera_Delphacidae.html Yao Cheng, Zhao-Peng Shi, Li-Ben Jiang, Lin-Quan Ge, Jin-Cai Wu, Gary C.

===Ryanoids===

[[Ryanoids]] are synthetic analogues with the same mode of action as [[ryanodine]], a naturally occurring insecticide extracted from ''[[Ryania speciosa]]'' ([[Flacourtiaceae]]). They bind to [[calcium channels]] in cardiac and skeletal muscle, blocking nervous transmission. Only one such insecticide is currently registered, [[Rynaxypyr]], generic name chlorantraniliprole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/factsheets/chloran.pdf|title=Pesticide Fact Sheet- chlorantraniliprole |publisher=http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/factsheets/chloran.pdf|date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref>

==Insect growth regulators ==
[[Insect growth regulator]] (IGR) is a term coined to include insect hormone mimics and an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit chitin (exoskeleton) biosynthesis in insects. [[Diflubenzuron]] is a member of the latter class,used primarily to control caterpillars which are pests. The most successful insecticides in this class are the juvenoids ([[juvenile hormone]] analogues). Of these, [[methoprene]] is most widely used. It has no observable acute toxicity in rats, and is approved by WHO for use in drinking water cisterns to combat malaria. Most of its uses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including mosquitoes, several fly species, and fleas. Two very similar products, [[hydroprene]] and [[kinoprene]] are used for controlling species such as cockroaches and white flies. [[Methoprene]] has been registered with the EPA since 1975, and there are virtually no reports of resistance. A more recent type of IGR is the ecdysone agonist [[tebufenozide]] (MIMIC), which is used in forestry and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects than other insect orders.

== Biological insecticides ==
Recent efforts to reduce broad spectrum toxins added to the environment have brought [[biological insecticide]]s back into vogue. An example is the development and increase in use of ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', a bacterial disease of [[Lepidoptera]]ns and some other insects. Toxins produced by different strains of this bacterium are used as a [[larvicide]] against  [[caterpillar]]s, beetles, and mosquitoes. Toxins from ''Saccharopolyspora spinosa'' are isolated from fermentations and sold as [[Spinosad]]. Because these toxins have little effect on other [[organism]]s, they are considered more [[environmentally friendly]] than synthetic pesticides. The toxin from ''B. thuringiensis'' ([[Bt toxin]]) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of [[genetic engineering]]. Other biological insecticides include products based on entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', ''[[Metarhizium anisopliae]]''), nematodes (e.g. ''Steinernema feltiae'') and viruses (e.g. ''Cydia pomonella'' granulovirus).{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Antifeedants===
Many plants exude substances to prevent insects from eating, but do not kill them directly.  Premier examples are substances activated by the [[enzyme]] [[myrosinase]].  This enzyme converts [[glucosinolate]]s to a variety of compounds that are toxic to herbivorous insects.  A notable [[allyl isothiocyanate]], the pungent ingredient in [[horseradish]] sauces.
[[File:Myrosinase general mechanism.png|thumb|center|760px|alt text=mechanism of glucosinolate hydrolysis by myrosinase|Biosynthesis of antifeedants by the action of myrosinase.]]

The myrosinase is only released upon crushing the flesh of horseradish by the herbivore (or preparer of horseradish sauce).  Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant as well as the insect, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme.<ref name=Cole>Rosemary A. Cole "Isothiocyanates, nitriles and thiocyanates as products of autolysis of glucosinolates in ''Cruciferae''" Phytochemutry, 1976. Vol. 15, pp. 759-762. {{DOI|10.1016/S0031-9422(00)94437-6}}</ref>

== Environmental effects ==

=== Effects on nontarget species ===
Some insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill. For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake insecticide granules on the ground for food and eat it.<ref name="palmerw">Palmer, WE, Bromley, PT, and Brandenburg, RL. [http://ipm.ncsu.edu/wildlife/peanuts_wildlife.html Wildlife & pesticides - Peanuts]. North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. Retrieved on 14 October 2007.</ref>

Sprayed insecticides may drift from the area to which it is applied and into wildlife areas, especially when it is sprayed aerially.<ref name="palmerw"/>

=== DDT ===
{{Main|DDT}}
The development of insecticides such as DDT has been motivated by desire to replace more dangerous or less effective alternatives.  [[DDT]] was introduced to replace [[lead]] and [[arsenic]]-based compounds, which were in widespread use in the early 1940s.<ref name=Ullmann>Robert L. Metcalf “Insect Control” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry” Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}</ref> 

Some insecticides have been banned due to the fact that they are persistent toxins which have adverse effects on animals and/or humans. An oft-quoted case is that of [[DDT]], an example of a widely used (and maybe misused) pesticide, which was brought to public attention by [[Rachel Carson]]'s book, [[Silent Spring]]. One of the better known impacts of DDT is to reduce the thickness of the egg shells on predatory birds. The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable, causing reductions in bird populations. This occurs with DDT and a number of related compounds due to the process of [[bioaccumulation]], wherein the chemical, due to its stability and fat solubility, accumulates in organisms' [[fatty tissue]]s. Also, DDT may [[biomagnification|biomagnify]], which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the [[food chain]]. The near-worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds, such as the [[peregrine falcon]], to recover in recent years. A number of the [[organochlorine]] pesticides have been banned from most uses worldwide, and globally they are controlled via the [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. These include: [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], [[DDT]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[mirex]] and [[toxaphene]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Pollinator decline ===
[[Pesticide toxicity to bees|Insecticides can kill bees]] and may be a cause of [[pollinator decline]], the loss of bees that [[pollination|pollinate]] plants, and [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD),<ref name="Wells">{{cite news | author = Wells M | title = Vanishing bees threaten US crops | work = www.bbc.co.uk | publisher = BBC News | date = March 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm | accessdate = 19 September 2007 }}</ref> in which worker bees from a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]] or [[Western honey bee]] colony abruptly disappear. Loss of pollinators will mean a reduction in crop yields.<ref name="Wells"/> Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e. imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect foraging behavior of bees.<ref>Colin, M.
