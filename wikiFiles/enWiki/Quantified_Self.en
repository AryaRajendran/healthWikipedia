The '''Quantified Self'''<ref>{{cite web|last=Gary|first=Wolf|title=QS & The Macroscope|url=http://aether.com/themacroscope|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>  is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, [[skin conductance|arousal]], [[pulse oximetry|blood oxygen levels]]), and performance ([[cognitive test|mental]] and physical).  Such self-monitoring and self-sensing, which combines wearable sensors (EEG, ECG, video, etc.) and [[wearable computing]], is also known as [[lifelogging]] or [[sousveillance]]. Other names for using self-tracking data to improve daily functioning<ref>{{cite web|last=Dorminey|first=Bruce|title=Tic-Toc-Trac: New Watch Gadget Measures Time Perception For The Self-Quantifying|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2012/05/31/tic-toc-trac-new-watch-gadget-measures-time-perception-for-the-self-quantifying/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|authorlink=Bruce Dorminey|date=2012-05-31}}</ref> are “self-tracking”, "auto-analytics", “body hacking” and “self-quantifying”.<ref>{{cite web|title=Counting every moment|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548493|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=Mar 3rd 2012}}</ref>

==History==
The history of self-tracking using wearable sensors combined with [[wearable computing]] and wireless communication, dates back many years, and appeared, in the form of sousveillance (wearable physiological sensors, etc.) in the 1970s.<ref>Intelligent Image Processing, Steve Mann, John Wiley and Sons, 2001</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Today the global community has over a hundred groups in 31 countries around the world.<ref>http://quantified-self.meetup.com/</ref>

==Methodologies==
The primary methodology of self-quantification is data collection, followed by visualization, cross-referencing and the discovery of correlations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hesse|first=Monica|title=Bytes of Life|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/08/AR2008090802681_pf.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2012-03-26|date=September 9, 2008}}</ref>

Life-tracking information from various applications can be difficult to integrate and find meaning.  Websites such as [http://quantimodo.com/ Quantimodo] can help by synergizing, visualizing, and analyzing the cacophony data to identify correlations between specific input factors and treatments (independent variables) and mood outcomes (dependent variables). The [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] derived from an XY [[scatterplot]] of input behaviours and output states can quantify the effectiveness of various treatments.

The human mind is not powerful enough to keep track of the countless factors that go into producing an emotional state. Timeline graphical analysis can help to identify potential confounding uncontrolled variables that may be contaminating the results of an experiment.  

Fine-grained, personalized minimum effective dosages of drugs can be established.  Degrees of drug tolerance and withdrawal symptoms can be quantified.  By integrating the area under the mood curves, true cost-benefit analyses weighing therapeutic benefits against adverse effects can be performed.
