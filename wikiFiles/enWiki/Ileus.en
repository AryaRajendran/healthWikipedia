'''Ileus''' ({{IPA-en|ˈɪliəs|pronounced}} or {{IPA-en|ˈɪlɪəs|}})<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ileus?q=Ileus]</ref> is a disruption of the normal [[propulsion|propulsive]] ability of the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

Ileus is commonly defined simply as bowel obstruction.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ileus thefreedictionary.com > Ileus] Citing:

==Types==
Decreased propulsive ability may be broadly classified as caused either by bowel obstruction or intestinal atony or paralysis. However, there are instances where there are symptoms and signs of a bowel obstruction, but with absence of a mechanical obstruction, mainly in ''acute colonic pseudoobstruction'', also known as [[Ogilvie's syndrome]].

===Bowel obstruction===
{{Main|Bowel obstruction}}
Bowel obstruction is generally a mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.

===Intestinal atony or paralysis===

Paralysis of the intestine is often termed ''paralytic ileus''. To be termed "paralytic ileus", the intestinal paralysis need not be complete, but it must be sufficient to prohibit the passage of food through the intestine and lead to intestinal blockage.

Paralytic ileus is a common side effect of some types of surgery, in these cases it is commonly called ''postsurgical ileus''. It can also result from certain drugs and from various injuries and illnesses, ''e.g.'' [[acute pancreatitis]]. Paralytic ileus causes constipation and bloating. On listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope, no bowel sounds are heard because the bowel is inactive.

A temporary paralysis of a portion of the intestines occurs typically after an abdominal surgery. Since the intestinal content of this portion is unable to move forward, food or drink should be avoided until peristaltic sound is heard from auscultation of the area where this portion lies.

Intestinal atony or paralysis may be caused by inhibitory neural reflexes, inflammation or other implication of neurohumoral peptides.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of ileus include, but are not limited to:
* moderate, diffuse [[abdominal discomfort]]
* [[constipation]]
* [[abdominal distension]]
* [[nausea]]/[[vomiting]], especially after meals
* lack of [[bowel movement]] and/or [[flatulence]]
* excessive [[belching]]

==Risk factors==
* [[Lower gastrointestinal surgery|gastrointestinal surgery]] or other GI procedures
* [[electrolyte imbalance]]
* [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kitabchi AE, Umpierrez GE, Murphy MB, ''et al.'' |title=Management of hyperglycemic crises in patients with diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=131–53 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11194218 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11194218}}</ref> and other causes of [[metabolic acidosis]]
* [[hypothyroidism]]
* [[medications]] (e.g. [[opiates]] or [[antimuscarinic]]s)
* severe [[illness]] (Inflammation with peritonitis)
* spinal cord injury (SCI), those with injury above [[Thoracic_vertebrae#Fifth_thoracic_vertebra|thoracic vertebrae 5]] (T5) will have hypomotility problems within the bowel

==Treatment in humans==
Traditionally, [[Nil per os|nil by mouth]] was considered to be mandatory in all cases, but now it is recognised that gentle feeding by enteral [[feeding tube]] may help to restore motility by triggering the gut's normal feedback signals, so this is the recommended management initially.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McClave SA, Martindale RG, Vanek VW, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=277–316 |year=2009 |pmid=19398613 |doi=10.1177/0148607109335234 |url=http://pen.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19398613}}</ref> When the patient has severe, persistent signs that motility is completely disrupted, [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric suction]] and [[parenteral]] nutrition may be required until passage is restored. In such cases, continuing aggressive enteral feeding causes a risk of perforating the gut. 

There are several options in the case of paralytic ileus. Most treatment is supportive. If caused by medication, the offending agent is discontinued or reduced. Bowel movements may be stimulated by prescribing [[lactulose]], [[erythromycin]] or, in severe cases that are thought to have a neurological component (such as [[Ogilvie's syndrome]]), [[neostigmine]]. There is also evidence that 'sham (imitated) feeding', such as chewing gum, may stimulate gastrointestinal motility in the post-operative period.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fitzgerald JE, Ahmed I |title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of chewing-gum therapy in the reduction of postoperative paralytic ileus following gastrointestinal surgery |journal=World J Surg |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=2557–66 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19763686 |doi=10.1007/s00268-009-0104-5 }}</ref>

If possible the underlying cause is corrected (e.g. replace electrolytes).

==Complications==
Ileus may increase [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesion]] formation, because intestinal segments have more prolonged contact, allowing fibrous adhesions to form, and intestinal distention causes serosal injury and ischemia. Intestinal distention has been shown to cause adhesions in foals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lundin C, Sullins KE, White NA, Clem MF, Debowes RM, Pfeiffer CA |title=Induction of peritoneal adhesions with small intestinal ischaemia and distention in the foal |journal=Equine Vet. J. |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=451–8 |year=1989 |month=November |pmid=2591362 }}</ref> Some respondents also mentioned the importance of walking horses postoperatively to stimulate motility. Repeat [[celiotomy]] to decompress chronically distended small intestine and remove fibrinous adhesions is also a useful method of treating ileus and reducting adhesions, and it has been associated with a good outcome <ref>{{cite journal |author=Vachon AM, Fischer AT |title=Small intestinal herniation through the epiploic foramen: 53 cases (1987–1993) |journal=Equine Vet. J. |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=373–80 |year=1995 |month=September |pmid=8654353 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Southwood LL, Baxter GM |title=Current concepts in management of abdominal adhesions |journal=Vet. Clin. North Am. Equine Pract. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=415–35 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9290192 }}</ref>
