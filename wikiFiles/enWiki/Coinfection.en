In [[parasitology]], '''coinfection''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|oʊ|ɪ|n|ˈ|f|ɛ|k|ʃ|ən}}) is the simultaneous [[infection]] of a [[host (biology)|host]] by multiple [[pathogens|pathogen]] [[species]]. In [[virology]], coinfection includes simultaneous infection of a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] by two or more [[virus]] particles. An example is the coinfection of [[liver]] cells with [[Hepatitis B virus]] and [[Hepatitis D virus]], which can arise incrementally by initial infection followed by [[superinfection]].

Global [[prevalence]] or [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of coinfection among humans is unknown, but it is thought to be commonplace,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=FE |title=Concomitant infections, parasites and immune responses |series=122 |journal=Parasitology |volume=Suppl |pages=S23–38 |year=2001 |pmid=11442193}}</ref> sometimes more common than single infection.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(97)00189-6 |last1=Petney |first1=TN |last2=Andrews |first2=RH |title=Multiparasite communities in animals and humans: frequency, structure and pathogenic significance |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=377–93 |year=1998 |pmid=9559357}}</ref>  Coinfection with [[helminths]] affects around 800 million people worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3285768 |last1=Crompton |first1=DW |title=How much human helminthiasis is there in the world? |journal=The Journal of parasitology |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=397–403 |year=1999 |pmid=10386428 |jstor=3285768}}</ref> 

Coinfection is of particular human health importance because pathogen species can [[Biological interaction|interact]] within the host. The net effect of coinfection on human health is thought to be negative.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2011.06.005 |last1=Griffiths |first1=EC |last2=Pedersen |first2=ABP |last3=Fenton |first3=A |last4=Petchey |first4=OP |title=The nature and consequences of coinfection in humans |journal=[[Journal of Infection]] |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=200–206 |year=2011 |pmid= 21704071}}</ref> Interactions can have either [[Ecological facilitation|positive]] or negative effects on each of the coinfecting parasite species. Under positive parasite interactions, disease [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] and progression are enhanced and this is also known as [[syndemic|syndemism]]. Negative parasite interactions include microbial interference when one bacterial species suppresses the [[virulence]] or [[colonisation (biology)|colonisation]] of other bacteria, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' suppressing pathogenic ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[colony]] formation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=L.

A globally common coinfection involves [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV]].
