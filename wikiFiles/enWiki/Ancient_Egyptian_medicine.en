The '''medicine of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians''' is some of the oldest documented. From the beginnings of the civilization in the c. 33rd century BC until the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of 525 BC, Egyptian medical practice went largely unchanged but was highly advanced for its time, including simple non-invasive [[surgery]], setting of [[bone]]s and an extensive set of [[pharmacopoeia]]. Egyptian medical thought influenced later traditions, including the Greeks.

==Sources of information==

Until the 19th century, the main sources of information about ancient Egyptian medicine were writings from later in antiquity. [[Homer]] c. 800 BC remarked in the ''[[Odyssey]]'': "''In Egypt, the men are more skilled in medicine than any of human kind''" and  ''"the Egyptians were skilled in medicine more than any other art"''.  The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] visited Egypt around 440 BC and wrote extensively of his observations of their medicinal practices. [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote favourably of them in historical review. [[Hippocrates]] (the "father of medicine"), [[Herophilos]], [[Erasistratus]] and later [[Galen]] studied at the temple of [[Amenhotep]], and acknowledged the contribution of ancient Egyptian medicine to Greek medicine.

In 1822, the translation of the [[Rosetta stone]] finally allowed the translation of ancient Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions and papyri, including many related to medical matters ([[Egyptian medical papyri]]). The resultant interest in [[Egyptology]] in the 19th century led to the discovery of several sets of extensive ancient medical documents, including the [[Ebers papyrus]], the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], the [[Hearst Papyrus]], the [[London Medical Papyrus]] and others dating back as far as 3000 BC. The Edwin Smith Papyrus is a textbook on surgery and details [[anatomical]] observations and the "examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis" of numerous ailments.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&ct= Edwin Smith papyrus (Egyptian medical book)]. Britannic.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.</ref>  It was probably written around 1600 BC, but is regarded as a copy of several earlier texts. Medical information in it dates from as early as 3000 BC.<ref>[http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8.htm Medicine in Ancient Egypt 1]. Arabworldbooks.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.</ref>  [[Imhotep]] in the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]] is credited as the original author of the papyrus text, and founder of ancient Egyptian medicine. The earliest known [[surgery]] was performed in [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around 2750 BC.

The Ebers papyrus c. 1550 BC is full of incantations and foul applications meant to turn away disease-causing demons, and also includes 877 prescriptions.<ref>Pain, Stephanie. (2007). "The pharaohs' pharmacists." ''New Scientist''. 15 December 2007, p. 43.</ref> It may also contain the earliest documented awareness of [[tumor]]s, if the poorly understood ancient medical terminology has been correctly interpreted. Other information comes from the images that often adorn the walls of Egyptian tombs and the translation of the accompanying inscriptions. Advances in modern medical technology also contributed to the understanding of ancient Egyptian medicine. [[Paleopathology|Paleopathologist]]s were able to use [[X-Ray]]s and later [[CAT Scan]]s to view the bones and organs of [[mummy|mummies]]. [[Electron microscope]]s, [[mass spectrometry]] and various forensic techniques allowed scientists unique glimpses of the state of health in Egypt 4000 years ago.

Other documents as the Edwin Smith papyrus (1550 BC), Hearst papyrus (1450 BC), and [[Berlin papyrus]] (1200 BC) also provide valuable insight into ancient Egyptian medicine. The Edwin Smith papyrus for example mentioned research methods, the making of a diagnosis of the patient, and the setting of a treatment. It is thus viewed as a learning manual. Treatments consisted of ailments made from i.e. animal, vegetable or fruit substances or minerals.<ref>The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World by Brian M. Fagan</ref>

==Nutrition==
Fundamentally when considering the health of any culture nutrition must be discussed. The Ancient Egyptians were at least partially aware of the importance of diet, both in balance and moderation.<ref name="dollinger"/> Owing to Egypt's great endowment of fertile land, food production was never a major issue although of course no matter how bounteous the land, paupers and starvation still exist. The main crops for most of ancient Egyptian history were [[emmer wheat]] and barley. Consumed in the form of loaves which were produced in a variety of types through baking and fermentation, with yeast greatly enriching the nutritional value of the product, one farmer's crop could support an estimated twenty adults. Barley was also used in beer. Vegetables and fruits of many types were widely grown. Oil was produced from the linseed plant and there was a limited selections of spices and herbs. Meat (sheep, goats, pigs, wild game) was regularly available to at least the upper classes and fish were widely consumed, although there is evidence of prohibitions during certain periods against certain types of animal products; Herodotus wrote of the pig as being 'unclean'. Offerings to King Unas (c. 2494–2345 BC) were recorded as

“...milk, three kinds of beer, five kinds of wine, ten loaves, four of bread, ten of cakes four meats, different cuts, joints, roast, spleen, limb, breast, quail, goose, pigeon, figs, ten other fruits, three kinds of corn, barley, spelt, five kinds of oil, and fresh plants...”

It is clear that the Egyptian diet was not lacking for the upper classes and that even the lower classes may have had some selection (Nunn, 2002).

==Practices==
[[Image:Ancient Egyptian medical instruments.jpg|thumb|Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a [[Ptolemaic period]] inscription on the [[Temple of Kom Ombo]].]]
Medical knowledge in ancient Egypt had an excellent reputation, and rulers of other empires would ask the Egyptian pharaoh to send them their best physician to treat their loved ones.<ref>''A History of Medicine'' by Plinio Prioreschi, Horatius Print 1996, p.257f.</ref>  Egyptians had some knowledge of human [[anatomy]]. For example, in the classic [[Mummy|mummification]] process, mummifiers knew how to insert a long hooked implement through a nostril, breaking the thin bone of the brain case and remove the [[brain]]. They also must have had a general idea of the location in the body cavity of the inner organs, which they removed through a small incision in the left groin. But whether this knowledge was passed on to the practitioners of medicine is unknown and does not seem to have had any impact on their medical theories.

Egyptian physicians were aware of the existence of the pulse and of a connection between pulse and heart. The author of the Smith Papyrus even had a vague idea of a cardiac system, although not of blood circulation and he was unable, or deemed it unimportant, to distinguish between blood vessels, tendons, and nerves. They developed their theory of "channels" that carried air, water and blood to the body by analogies with the [[River Nile]]; if it became blocked, crops became unhealthy and they applied this principle to the body: If a person was unwell, they would use [[laxatives]] to unblock the "channels".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080501130207/http://www.passmoresschool.com/History/mrmodqa2.htm What progress did the Egyptians make in medical knowledge?]. passmoresschool.com</ref>

Quite a few medical practices were effective, such as many of the surgical procedures given in the Edwin Smith papyrus. Mostly, the physicians' advice for staying healthy was to wash and shave the body, including under the arms, and this may have prevented infections. They also advised patients to look after their diet, and avoid foods such as raw fish or other animals considered to be unclean.

Many practices were ineffective or harmful. Michael D. Parkins says that 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no known curative elements,<ref name='Parkins2001'>{{cite journal | title = Pharmacological Practices of Ancient Egypt | journal = Proceedings of the 10th Annual History of Medicine | date = 2001-03 | first = Michael D. | last = Parkins | coauthors = J. Szekrenyes| id =   | url = http://helios.e-e-e.gr/medicine/files/History_of_medicine_days.pdf#page=17 | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}</ref> and many contained animal dung which contains products of fermentation and molds, some of them having curative properties,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} but also bacteria posing a grave threat of infection.

===Surgery===
Surgery was a common practice among physicians as treatment for physical injuries. The Egyptian physicians recognized three categories of injuries; treatable, contestable, and untreatable ailments. Treatable ailments the surgeons would quickly set to right. Contestable ailments were those where the victim could presumably survive without treatment, so patients assumed to be in this category were observed and if they survived then surgical attempts could be made to fix the problem with them. They used knives, hooks, drills, forceps, pincers, scales, spoons, saws and a vase with burning incense.<ref>Greiner, Ryan (2001). [http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/greiner/ "Ancient Egyptian Medicine".] Accessed February 2011.</ref>

[[Circumcision]] of males was the norm, as stated by Herodotus in his [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]].<ref>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2131/2131-h/2131-h.htm</ref> Though its performance as a procedure was rarely mentioned, the uncircumcised nature of other cultures was frequently noted, the uncircumcised nature of the [[Liberians]] was frequently referenced and military campaigns brought back uncircumcised [[phalli]] as trophies, which suggests novelty. Although other records describe initiates into the religious orders as involving circumcision which would imply that the practice was special and not widespread. The only known depiction of the procedure, in the The Tomb of the Physician, burial place of [[Ankh-Mahor]] at Saqquarra, shows adolescents or adults, not babies.  [[Female circumcision]] may have been practiced, although the single reference to it in ancient texts may be a mistranslation.<ref name="dollinger">André Dollinger. [http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/medicine.htm Ancient Egyptian Medicine.] December 2002.</ref>

Prosthetics, such as artificial toes and eyeballs, were also used; typically, they served little more than decorative purposes. In preparation for burial, missing body parts would be replaced (but these do not appear as if they would have been useful, or even attachable) before death.<ref name="dollinger"/>

The extensive use of surgery, mummification practices, and autopsy as a religious exercise gave Egyptians a vast knowledge of the body's morphology, and even a considerable understanding of organ functions. The function of most major organs was correctly presumed—for example, blood was correctly guessed to be a transpiration medium for vitality and waste which is not too far from its actual role in carrying oxygen and removing carbon dioxide—with the exception of the heart and brain whose functions were switched.

===Dentistry===
Dentistry was an important field, as an independent profession it dated from the early 3rd millennium BC, although it may not have never been prominent. The Egyptian diet was high in abrasives (such as sand left over from grinding grain and bits of rocks in which the way bread was prepared) and so the condition of their teeth was quite poor, although archaeologists have noted a steady decrease in severity and incidence of worn teeth throughout 4000 BC to 1000 AD, probably due to improved grain grinding techniques.<ref name="nunn">John Francis Nunn. Ancient Egyptian Medicine. University of Oklahoma Press, 1996.</ref> All Egyptian remains have sets of teeth in quite poor states. Dental disease could even be fatal, such as for [[Djedmaatesankh]], a musician from Thebes, who died around the age of thirty five from extensive dental disease and a large infected cyst. If an individual's teeth escaped being worn down, cavities were rare, due to the rarity of sweeteners. Dental treatment was infective and the best sufferers could hope for was the quick loss of an infected tooth. The [[Instruction of Ankhsheshonq]] contains the maxim "There is no tooth that rots yet stays in place".<ref name="dollinger"/> No records document the hastening of this process and no tools suited for the extraction of teeth have been found, though some remains show sign of forced tooth removal.<ref name="nunn"/> Replacement teeth have been found, although it is not clear whether they are just post-mortem cosmetics. Extreme pain might have been medicated with [[opium]].<ref name="dollinger"/>

==Magic and religion==
[[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] and [[religion]] were an integral part of everyday life in [[ancient Egypt]]. [[Egyptian mythology|Evil gods]] and [[demon]]s were thought to be responsible for many ailments, so often the treatments involved a [[supernatural]] element, such as beginning treatment with an appeal to a deity. There does not appear to have existed a clear distinction between what nowadays one would consider the very distinct callings of priest and physician. The healers, many of them priests of [[Sekhmet]], often used [[incantation]]s and magic as part of treatment.

The widespread belief in magic and religion may have resulted in a powerful [[placebo effect]]; that is, the perceived validity of the cure may have contributed to its effectiveness. The impact of the emphasis on magic is seen in the selection of remedies or ingredients for them. Ingredients were sometimes selected seemingly because they were derived from a substance, plant or animal that had characteristics which in some way corresponded to the symptoms of the patient. This is known as the principle of ''simila similibus'' ("similar with similar") and is found throughout the history of medicine up to the modern practice of [[homeopathy]]. Thus an [[ostrich]] egg is included in the treatment of a broken skull, and an [[amulet]] portraying a [[hedgehog]] might be used against [[baldness]].

Amulets in general were very popular, being worn for many magical purposes. Health related amulets are classified as homeopoetic, phylactic and theophoric. Homeopoetic amulets portray an animal or part of an animal, from which the wearer hopes to gain positive attributes like strength or speed. Phylactic amulets protected against harmful gods and demons. The famous [[Eye of Horus]] was often used on a phylactic amulet. [[Theophoric]] amulets represented Egyptian gods; one represented the [[girdle]] of [[Isis]] and was intended to stem the flow of blood at miscarriage. They were often made of bone, hanging from a leather strap.

==Doctors and other healers==
[[Image:Prosthetic toe.jpg|thumb|This wood and leather prosthetic toe was used by an amputee to facilitate walking]]
The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for doctor is "wabau". This title has a long history. The earliest recorded physician in the world, [[Hesy-Ra]], practiced in [[History of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]]. He was  “Chief of Dentists and Physicians” to King [[Djoser]], who ruled in the 27th century BC.<ref name="arabworldbooks">[http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm Arabworldbook.com: Medicine in Ancient Egypt]. Arabworldbooks.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.</ref>  The lady [[Peseshet]] (2400 BC) may be the first recorded female doctor: she was possibly the mother of [[Akhethotep]], and on a [[stela]] dedicated to her in his tomb she is referred to as ''imy-r swnwt'', which has been translated as “Lady Overseer of the Lady Physicians” (''swnwt'' is the feminine of ''swnw'').

There were many ranks and specializations in the field of medicine. Royalty employed their own ''swnw'', even their own specialists. There were inspectors of doctors, overseers and chief doctors. Known ancient Egyptian specialists are [[ophthalmologist]], [[Gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]], [[proctologist]], [[dentist]], "doctor who supervises [[butcher]]s" and an unspecified "inspector of liquids". The ancient Egyptian term for proctologist, ''neru phuyt'', literally translates as "shepherd of the anus".

Institutions, so called ''Houses of Life'', are known to have been established in ancient Egypt since the [[First dynasty of Egypt|1st Dynasty]] and may have had medical functions, being at times associated in inscriptions with physicians, such as Peftauawyneit and Wedjahorresnet living in the middle of the 1st millennium BC.<ref>[http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/museum/museum2.html Digital Egypt for Universities (University College of London website) – "Knowledge and production: the House of Life"]. Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.</ref> By the time of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]] their employees enjoyed such benefits as [[medical insurance]], [[pensions]] and [[sick leave]].<ref name="arabworldbooks" />
