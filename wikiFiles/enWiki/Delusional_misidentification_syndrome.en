'''Delusional misidentification syndrome''' is an umbrella term, introduced by Christodoulou (in his book ''The Delusional Misidentification Syndromes'', Karger, Basel, 1986) for a group of [[delusion]]al disorders that occur in the context of [[mental illness|mental]] or [[neurological illness]]. They all involve a belief that the identity of a person, object or place has somehow changed or has been altered. As these delusions typically only concern one particular topic they also fall under the category called [[monothematic delusion]]s. 

This syndrome is usually considered to include four main variants:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellis HD, Luauté JP, Retterstøl N |title=Delusional misidentification syndromes |journal=Psychopathology |volume=27 |issue=3-5 |pages=117–20 |year=1994 |pmid=7846223 }}</ref>
* The [[Capgras delusion]] is the belief that (usually) a close relative or spouse has been replaced by an identical-looking [[impostor]].
* The [[Fregoli delusion]] is the belief that various people the believer meets are actually the same person in disguise.
* [[Intermetamorphosis]] is the belief that people in the environment swap identities with each other whilst maintaining the same appearance.
* [[Syndrome of subjective doubles|Subjective doubles]], described by Christodoulou in 1978 (''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 135, 249, 1978), is the belief that there is a [[doppelgänger]] or double of him or herself carrying out independent actions.<ref>Christodoulou G.N.

Syndrome of Subjective Doubles, Am. J. Psychiat.135,249,1978</ref>

However, similar delusional beliefs, often singularly or more rarely reported, are sometimes also considered to be part of the delusional misidentification syndrome. For example:
* [[Mirrored-self misidentification]] is the belief that one's reflection in a mirror is some other person.
* [[Reduplicative paramnesia]] is the belief that a familiar person, place, object or body part has been duplicated. For example, a person may believe that they are in fact not in the hospital to which they were admitted, but an identical-looking hospital in a different part of the country, despite this being obviously false.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benson DF, Gardner H, Meadows JC |title=Reduplicative paramnesia |journal=Neurology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=147–51 |year=1976 |month=February |pmid=943070 }}</ref>
*The [[Cotard delusion]]  is a rare disorder in which people hold a [[delusion]]al belief that they are [[death|dead]] (either figuratively or literally), do not exist, are [[putrefaction|putrefying]], or have lost their [[blood]] or [[internal organs]].  In rare instances, it can include delusions of immortality.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berrios G.E., Luque R. | year = 1995 | title = Cotard Syndrome: clinical analysis of 100 cases | url = | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 185–188 }}</ref>
* [[Delusional companion syndrome|Syndrome of delusional companions]] is the belief that objects (such as soft toys) are sentient beings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shanks MF, Venneri A |title=The emergence of delusional companions in Alzheimer's disease: an unusual misidentification syndrome |journal=Cogn Neuropsychiatry |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=317–28 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=16571545 |doi=10.1080/13546800244000021 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/13546800244000021&magic=pubmed&#124;&#124;1B69BA326FFE69C3F0A8F227DF8201D0}}</ref>
* Clonal pluralization of the self, where a person believes there are multiple copies of him or herself, identical both physically and psychologically but physically separate and distinct.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vörös V, Tényi T, Simon M, Trixler M |title='Clonal pluralization of the self': a new form of delusional misidentification syndrome |journal=Psychopathology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=46–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12679592 |doi=10.1159/000069656 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=PSP36046}}</ref>

There is considerable evidence that disorders such as the [[Capgras delusion|Capgras]] or [[Fregoli delusion|Fregoli]] syndromes are associated with disorders of [[face perception]] and recognition. However, it has been suggested that all misidentification problems may exist on a continuum of anomalies of familiarity,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sno HN |title=A continuum of misidentification symptoms |journal=Psychopathology |volume=27 |issue=3-5 |pages=144–7 |year=1994 |pmid=7846229 }}</ref> from [[déjà vu]] at one end to the formation of delusional beliefs at the other.
