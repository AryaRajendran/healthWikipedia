=== Marketed products===
[[Vancomycin|Vancocin Pulvules HCl]]: licensed from [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pollack | first = Andrew | title = Crucial Antibiotic Rescues Biotech Maker's Finances | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2005-11-09 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/business/09viro.html | accessdate = 2007-09-20 }}</ref> Oral Vancocin is an [[antibiotic]] for treatment of [[staphylococcal]] [[enterocolitis]] and [[antibiotic]] associated [[pseudomembranous colitis]] caused by [[Clostridium difficile]].

===Pipeline===
[[Maribavir]] is an [[Route of administration|oral]] [[antiviral drug]] candidate licensed from [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in 2003 for the [[Prophylaxis|prevention]] and treatment of human [[cytomegalovirus]] disease in [[hematopoietic stem cell]]/[[bone marrow transplant]] patients.  In February 2006, ViroPharma announced that the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) had granted the company [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|fast track]] status for maribavir.

In March 2006, the company announced that a [[clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] study with maribavir demonstrated that [[prophylaxis]] with maribavir displays strong antiviral activity, as measured by [[statistically significant]] reduction in the rate of reactivation of CMV in recipients of [[hematopoietic stem cell]]/[[bone marrow transplant]]s. In an [[intent-to-treat]] analysis of the first 100 days after the transplant, the number of subjects who required pre-emptive anti-CMV therapy was [[statistically significant]]ly reduced ([[p-value]] = 0.051 to 0.001) in each of the maribavir groups compared to the [[placebo]] group (57% for [[placebo]] vs. 15%, 30%, and 15% for maribavir 100&nbsp;mg twice daily, 400&nbsp;mg daily, and 400&nbsp;mg twice daily, respectively).

ViroPharma conducted a [[clinical trial#Phase III|Phase III]] clinical study to evaluate the [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] use for the prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in recipients of [[tissue engineering|allogeneic]] [[stem cell]] transplant patients.  In February 2009, ViroPharma announced that the Phase III study failed to achieve its goal, showing no significant difference between maribavir and a placebo in reducing the rate of CMV disease.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200902091012DOWJONESDJONLINE000320_FORTUNE5.htm ViroPharma:Maribavir Phase III Study Missed Goal;Shares Plunge], CNN Money, February 09, 2009</ref>

{{Main|Pleconaril}}
[[route of administration|Oral]] pleconaril was ViroPharma's first compound, licensed from [[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi]] in 1995. Pleconaril is active against viruses in the [[picornavirus]] family. ViroPharma's first indication was for [[Enterovirus|enteroviral]] [[meningitis]], but that indication was abandoned when the [[clinical trial]]s did not demonstrate efficacy.

In 2001, ViroPharma submitted a New Drug Application of pleconaril to the FDA for the [[common cold]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Freundlich | first = Naomi | title = On the Trail of a Cure For the Common Cold | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2002-02-03 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DD143DF930A35751C0A9649C8B63 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 }}</ref> On 2002-03-19, the FDA Antiviral Advisory Committee recommended that the company had failed to show adequate safety, and the FDA subsequently issued a not-approvable letter.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pollack | first = Andrew | title = F.D.A.

(The stock price recovered in 2005.)

In November 2003, ViroPharma licensed pleconaril to [[Schering-Plough]], who are developing an intranasal formulation for the [[common cold]] and [[asthma]] exacerbations. ([http://www.schering-plough.com/schering_plough/research/spri/product_pipeline.jsp Schering-Plough Development Pipeline]). In August 2006, Schering-Plough started a [[clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II clinical trial]].
