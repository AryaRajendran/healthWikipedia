{{Hatnote|This article is about blood clotting. For other meanings see ''[[Coagulation (disambiguation)]]''.}}
'''Coagulation''' ('''thrombogenesis''') is the process by which [[blood]] forms [[clot]]s. It is an important part of [[hemostasis]], the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, wherein a damaged [[blood vessel]] wall is covered by a [[platelet]] and [[fibrin]]-containing clot to stop [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding ([[hemorrhage]]) or obstructive clotting ([[thrombosis]]).<ref name="isbn1-4051-8460-4">{{cite book |author=David Lillicrap; Nigel Key; Michael Makris; Denise O'Shaughnessy |title=Practical Hemostasis and Thrombosis |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2009 |pages=1–5 |isbn=1-4051-8460-4 }}</ref>

Coagulation is highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] throughout biology; in all [[mammal]]s, coagulation involves both a cellular (platelet) and a [[protein]] (coagulation factor) component.<ref name="Michelson2006">{{cite book|author=Alan D.

Coagulation begins almost instantly after an injury to the blood vessel has damaged the [[endothelium]] lining the vessel. Exposure of the blood to proteins such as [[tissue factor]] initiates changes to blood platelets and the plasma protein [[fibrinogen]], a clotting factor. [[Platelet]]s immediately form a plug at the site of injury; this is called ''primary hemostasis''. ''Secondary hemostasis'' occurs simultaneously: Proteins in the [[blood plasma]], called ''coagulation factors'' or ''clotting factors'', respond in a complex cascade to form [[fibrin]] strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.<ref name=Furie>{{cite journal |author=Furie B, Furie BC |title=Thrombus formation in vivo |journal=J.

==Physiology==
===Platelet activation===
When the endothelium is damaged, the normally isolated, underlying collagen is exposed to circulating platelets, which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific [[glycoprotein]] <tt>Ia/IIa</tt> surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF), which is released from the endothelium and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets' glycoprotein <tt>Ib/IX/V</tt> and the collagen fibrils. These adhesions also activate the platelets.<ref name="Palister1">{{cite book |author=Pallister CJ and Watson MS |title=Haematology |publisher=Scion Publishing |location= |year=2010 |pages=334–336 |isbn=1-904842-39-9}}</ref>

Activated platelets release the contents of stored granules into the blood plasma. The granules include [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[serotonin]], [[platelet-activating factor]] (PAF), [[von Willebrand factor|vWF]], [[platelet factor 4]], and [[Thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] (TXA<sub>2</sub>), which, in turn, activate additional platelets. The granules' contents activate a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G<sub>q</sub>-linked protein receptor]] cascade, resulting in increased calcium concentration in the platelets' cytosol. The calcium activates [[protein kinase C]], which, in turn, activates [[Phospholipase A2|phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>]] (PLA<sub>2</sub>). PLA<sub>2</sub> then modifies the [[integrin]] membrane glycoprotein <tt>IIb/IIIa</tt>, increasing its affinity to bind [[fibrinogen]]. The activated platelets change shape from spherical to stellate, and the [[fibrinogen]] cross-links with [[glycoprotein]] <tt>IIb/IIIa</tt> aid in aggregation of adjacent platelets  (completing primary hemostasis).<ref name="Palister1"/>

===The coagulation cascade===
[[File:Classical blood coagulation pathway.png|right|thumb|350px|The classical blood coagulation pathway<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9"/>]]
The coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis has two pathways which lead to ''[[fibrin]]'' formation. These are the ''contact activation pathway'' (also known as the intrinsic pathway), and the ''tissue factor pathway'' (also known as the extrinsic pathway).  It was previously thought that the coagulation cascade consisted of two pathways of equal importance joined to a common pathway. It is now known that the primary pathway for the initiation of blood coagulation is the ''tissue factor'' pathway. The pathways are a series of reactions, in which a [[zymogen]] (inactive enzyme precursor) of a [[serine protease]] and its [[glycoprotein]] co-factor are activated to become active components that then catalyze the next reaction in the cascade, ultimately resulting in cross-linked fibrin. Coagulation factors are generally indicated by [[Roman numeral]]s, with a lowercase ''a'' appended to indicate an active form.<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9">{{cite book |author=Pallister CJ and  Watson MS |title=Haematology |publisher=Scion Publishing |location= |year=2010 |pages=336–347 |isbn=1-904842-39-9}}</ref>

The coagulation factors are generally [[serine protease]]s ([[enzymes]]), which act by cleaving downstream proteins.  There are some exceptions.  For example, FVIII and FV are glycoproteins, and Factor XIII is a [[transglutaminase]].<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9"/> The coagulation factors circulate as inactive [[zymogens]]. 
The coagulation cascade is classically divided into three pathways. The ''tissue factor'' and ''contact activation'' pathways both activate the "final common pathway" of factor X, thrombin and fibrin.<ref name="isbn0-632-05153-1">{{cite book |author=Hoffbrand, A. V. |title=Essential haematology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2002 |pages=241–243 |isbn=0-632-05153-1}}</ref>

====Tissue factor pathway (extrinsic)====
The main role of the tissue factor pathway is to generate a "thrombin burst,"  a process by which [[thrombin]], the most important constituent of the coagulation cascade in terms of its feedback activation roles, is released very rapidly. FVIIa circulates in a higher amount than any other activated coagulation factor. 

* Following damage to the blood vessel, FVII leaves the circulation and comes into contact with [[tissue factor]] (TF) expressed on tissue-factor-bearing cells ([[stromal cell|stroma]]l fibroblasts and leukocytes), forming an activated complex (TF-FVIIa).
* TF-FVIIa activates FIX and FX.
* FVII is itself activated by thrombin, FXIa, FXII and FXa.
* The activation of FX (to form FXa) by TF-FVIIa is almost immediately inhibited by [[tissue factor pathway inhibitor]] (TFPI).
* FXa and its co-factor FVa form the [[prothrombinase]] complex, which activates [[prothrombin]] to thrombin.
* Thrombin then activates other components of the coagulation cascade, including FV and FVIII (which activates FXI, which, in turn, activates FIX), and activates and releases FVIII from being bound to vWF.
* FVIIIa is the co-factor of FIXa, and together they form the "[[tenase]]" complex, which activates FX; and so the cycle continues. ("Tenase" is a contraction of "ten" and the suffix "-ase" used for enzymes.)<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9"/>

====Contact activation pathway (intrinsic)==== <!--Contact activation pathway redirects here-->
The contact activation pathway begins with formation of the primary complex on [[collagen]] by [[high-molecular-weight kininogen]] (HMWK), [[prekallikrein]], and [[Hageman factor|FXII (Hageman factor)]]. [[Prekallikrein]] is converted to [[kallikrein]] and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the [[tenase]] complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor role that the contact activation pathway has in initiating [[clot formation]] can be illustrated by the fact that patients with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and [[prekallikrein]] do not have a bleeding disorder. Instead, contact activation system seems to be more involved in inflammation.<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9"/>

====Final common pathway====
''Thrombin'' has a large array of functions. Its primary role is the conversion of [[fibrinogen]] to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor [[protein C]] (in the presence of [[thrombomodulin]]), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms [[covalent bond]]s that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9"/>

Following activation by the contact factor or tissue factor pathways, the coagulation cascade is maintained in a prothrombotic state by the continued activation of FVIII and FIX to form the [[tenase]] complex, until it is down-regulated by the anticoagulant pathways.<ref name="isbn1-904842-39-9"/>

===Cofactors===
Various substances are required for the proper functioning of the coagulation cascade:
* [[Calcium]] and [[phospholipid]] (a [[platelet]] membrane constituent) are required for the tenase and prothrombinase complexes to function. Calcium mediates the binding of the complexes via the terminal gamma-carboxy residues on FXa and FIXa to the phospholipid surfaces expressed by platelets, as well as procoagulant microparticles or [[microvesicles]] shed from them. Calcium is also required at other points in the coagulation cascade.
* [[Vitamin K]] is an essential factor to a hepatic [[gamma-glutamyl carboxylase]] that adds a [[carboxyl]] group to [[glutamic acid]] residues on factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as [[Protein S]], Protein C and [[Protein Z]]. In adding the gamma-carboxyl group to glutamate residues on the immature clotting factors Vitamin K is itself oxidized. Another enzyme, ''[[Vitamin K epoxide reductase]]'', (VKORC) reduces vitamin K back to its active form. Vitamin K epoxide reductase is pharmacologically important as a target of anticoagulant drugs [[warfarin]] and related [[coumarin]]s such as [[acenocoumarol]], [[phenprocoumon]], and [[dicumarol]]. These drugs create a deficiency of reduced vitamin K by blocking VKORC, thereby inhibiting maturation of clotting factors. Vitamin K deficiency from other causes (e.g., in [[malabsorption]]) or impaired vitamin K metabolism in disease (e.g., in [[hepatic failure]]) lead to the formation of PIVKAs (proteins formed in vitamin K absence) which are partially or totally non-gamma carboxylated, affecting the coagulation factors' ability to bind to phospholipid.

===Regulators===
Five mechanisms keep platelet activation and the coagulation cascade in check. Abnormalities can lead to an increased tendency toward thrombosis:
* [[Protein C]] is a major physiological anticoagulant. It is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease enzyme that is activated by thrombin into activated protein C (APC). Protein C is activated in a sequence that starts with Protein C and thrombin binding to a cell surface protein [[thrombomodulin]]. Thrombomodulin binds these proteins in such a way that it activates Protein C. The activated form, along with protein S and a phospholipid as cofactors, degrades FVa and FVIIIa. Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of either may lead to [[thrombophilia]] (a tendency to develop thrombosis). Impaired action of Protein C (activated Protein C resistance), for example by [[Factor V Leiden|having the "Leiden" variant of Factor V]] or high levels of FVIII also may lead to a thrombotic tendency.
* [[Antithrombin]] is a [[serine protease inhibitor]] ([[serpin]]) that degrades the serine proteases: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased by the presence of [[heparan sulfate]] (a [[glycosaminoglycan]]) or the administration of [[heparin]]s (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (inborn or acquired, e.g., in [[proteinuria]]) leads to thrombophilia.
* [[Tissue factor pathway inhibitor]] (TFPI) limits the action of tissue factor (TF). It also inhibits excessive TF-mediated activation of FVII and FX.
* [[Plasmin]] is generated by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelium. Plasmin proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products that inhibit excessive fibrin formation.
* [[Prostacyclin]] (PGI<sub>2</sub>) is released by endothelium and activates platelet G<sub>s</sub> protein-linked receptors. This, in turn, activates [[adenylyl cyclase]], which synthesizes cAMP. cAMP inhibits platelet activation by decreasing cytosolic levels of calcium and, by doing so, inhibits the release of granules that would lead to activation of additional platelets and the coagulation cascade.<ref name="Hoffband2">{{cite book |author=Hoffbrand, A. V. |title=Essential haematology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2002 |pages=243–245 |isbn=0-632-05153-1}}</ref>

===Fibrinolysis===
{{main|Fibrinolysis}}
Eventually, blood clots are reorganised and resorbed by a process termed ''[[fibrinolysis]]''. The main enzyme responsible for this process ([[plasmin]]) is regulated by various activators and inhibitors.<ref name="Hoffband2"/>

===Role in immune system===
The coagulation system overlaps with the [[immune system]]. Coagulation can physically trap invading microbes in blood clots. Also, some products of the coagulation system can contribute to the [[innate immune system]] by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as [[chemotactic agent]]s for [[phagocytic cell]]s. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly [[antimicrobial]]. For example, [[beta-lysine]], a protein produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause [[lysis]] of many [[Gram-positive bacteria]] by acting as a cationic detergent.<ref name=Mayer>[http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/ghaffar/innate.htm Immunology – Chapter One: Innate ot non-specific immunity] Gene Mayer, Ph.D. Immunology Section of Microbiology and Immunology On-line. University of South Carolina</ref> Many [[acute-phase protein]]s of [[inflammation]] are involved in the coagulation system. In addition, pathogenic bacteria may secrete agents that alter the coagulation system, e.g. [[coagulase]] and [[streptokinase]].

==Testing of coagulation==
[[File:Fibrin-nach-Thromboplastin.jpg|thumb|Blood plasma after the addition of Tissue Factor forms a gel-like structure (Test for prothrombin time).
]]
Numerous tests are used to assess the function of the coagulation system:<ref name="Lillicrap">{{cite book |author=David Lillicrap; Nigel Key; Michael Makris; Denise O'Shaughnessy |title=Practical Hemostasis and Thrombosis |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2009 |pages=7–16 |isbn=1-4051-8460-4}}</ref>
* Common: [[Partial thromboplastin time|aPTT]], [[prothrombin time|PT]] (also used to determine [[International normalized ratio|INR]]), [[fibrinogen]] testing (often by the [[Clauss method]]), [[platelet]] count, platelet function testing (often by [[PFA-100]]), [[thrombodynamics test]].
* Other: [[Thrombin clotting time|TCT]], [[bleeding time]], [[mixing test]] (whether an abnormality corrects if the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma), coagulation factor assays, [[antiphospholipid antibody|antiphosholipid antibodies]], [[D-dimer]], genetic tests (e.g. [[factor V Leiden]], [[prothrombin]] mutation G20210A), [[dilute Russell's viper venom time]] (dRVVT), miscellaneous platelet function tests, [[thromboelastography]] (TEG or Sonoclot), [[euglobulin lysis time]] (ELT).

The contact activation (intrinsic) pathway is initiated by activation of the "contact factors" of plasma, and can be measured by the [[partial thromboplastin time|activated partial thromboplastin]] time (aPTT) test.

The tissue factor (extrinsic) pathway is initiated by release of [[tissue factor]] (a specific cellular lipoprotein), and can be measured by the [[prothrombin time]] (PT) test. PT results are often reported as ratio ([[International normalized ratio|INR]] value) to monitor dosing of oral anticoagulants such as [[warfarin]].

The quantitative and qualitative screening of fibrinogen is measured by the [[thrombin clotting time]] (TCT). Measurement of the exact amount of fibrinogen present in the blood is generally done using the [[Clauss method]] for fibrinogen testing.  Many analysers are capable of measuring a "derived fibrinogen" level from the graph of the Prothrombin time clot.  

If a coagulation factor is part of the contact activation or tissue factor pathway, a deficiency of that factor will affect only one of the tests: Thus [[hemophilia A]], a deficiency of factor VIII, which is part of the contact activation pathway, results in an abnormally prolonged aPTT test but a normal PT test. The exceptions are prothrombin, fibrinogen, and some variants of FX that can be detected only by either aPTT or PT. If an abnormal PT or aPTT is present, additional testing will occur to determine which (if any) factor is present as aberrant concentrations.

Deficiencies of fibrinogen (quantitative or qualitative) will affect all screening tests.

==Role in disease==
Problems with coagulation may dispose to hemorrhage, thrombosis, and occasionally both, depending on the nature of the pathology.<ref name="isbn1-4051-8050-1">{{cite book |author=Hatton, Chris |title=Haematology (Lecture Notes) |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2008 |pages=145–166 |isbn=1-4051-8050-1}}</ref>

===Platelet disorders===
Platelet conditions may be congenital or acquired. Some inborn platelet pathologies are [[Glanzmann's thrombasthenia]], [[Bernard-Soulier syndrome]] (abnormal glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex), [[gray platelet syndrome]] (deficient [[alpha granules]]), and [[delta storage pool deficiency]] (deficient [[dense granules]]). Most are rare conditions. Most inborn platelet pathologies predispose to hemorrhage. [[Von Willebrand disease]] is due to deficiency or abnormal function of [[von Willebrand factor]], and leads to a similar bleeding pattern; its milder forms are relatively common.

Decreased platelet numbers may be due to various causes, including insufficient production (e.g., in [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system ([[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]]/ITP), and consumption due to various causes ([[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]]/TTP, [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]/HUS, [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]/PNH, [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]/DIC, [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]]/HIT). Most consumptive conditions lead to platelet activation, and some are associated with thrombosis.

===Disease and clinical significance of thrombosis===
The best-known coagulation factor disorders are the [[hemophilia]]s. The three main forms are [[hemophilia A]] (factor VIII deficiency), [[hemophilia B]] (factor IX deficiency or "Christmas disease") and [[hemophilia C]] (factor XI deficiency, mild bleeding tendency). Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders, whereas Hemophilia C is much more rare autosomal recessive  disorder most commonly seen in [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. 

[[Von Willebrand disease]] (which behaves more like a platelet disorder except in severe cases), is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder and is characterized as being inherited autosomal recessive or dominant. In this disease, there is a defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF), which mediates the binding of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) to collagen. This binding helps mediate the activation of platelets and formation of primary hemostasis. 

Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a defect or deficiency in GPIb. GPIb, the receptor for vWF, can be defective and lead to lack of primary clot formation (primary hemostasis) and increased bleeding tendency. This is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.

Thrombasthenia of Glanzmann and Naegeli ([[Glanzmann thrombasthenia]]) is extremely rare. It is characterized by a defect in GPIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor complex. When GPIIb/IIIa receptor is dysfunctional, fibrinogen cannot cross-link platelets, which inhibits primary hemostasis. This is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. 

In [[liver failure]] (acute and chronic forms), there is insufficient production of coagulation factors by the liver; this may increase bleeding risk. 

Deficiency of Vitamin K may also contribute to bleeding disorders because clotting factor maturation depends on Vitamin K. 

[[Thrombosis]] is the pathological development of blood clots. These clots may break free and become mobile, forming an [[Embolism|embolus]] or grow to such a size that occludes the vessel in which it developed.  An [[embolism]] is said to occur when the [[thrombus]] (blood clot) becomes a mobile embolus and migrates to another part of the body, interfering with blood circulation and hence impairing organ function downstream of the occlusion. This causes [[ischemia]] and often leads to ischemic [[necrosis]] of tissue. Most cases of [[venous thrombosis]] are due to acquired states (older age, surgery, cancer, immobility) or inherited [[thrombophilia]]s (e.g., [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[factor V Leiden]], and various other genetic deficiencies or variants).

Mutations in [[factor XII]] have been associated with an asymptomatic prolongation in the clotting time and possibly a tendency toward [[thrombophlebitis]]. Other mutations have been linked with a rare form of [[angioedema|hereditary angioedema]] (type III).

==Pharmacology==
===Procoagulants===
The use of adsorbent chemicals, such as [[zeolite]]s, and other [[hemostatic agent]]s are also used for sealing severe injuries quickly (such as in traumatic bleeding secondary to gunshot wounds). Thrombin and fibrin [[glue]] are used surgically to treat bleeding and to thrombose aneurysms.

[[Desmopressin]] is used to improve platelet function by activating [[arginine vasopressin receptor 1A]].

Coagulation factor concentrates are used to treat [[hemophilia]], to reverse the effects of anticoagulants, and to treat bleeding in patients with impaired coagulation factor synthesis or increased consumption. [[Prothrombin complex concentrate]], [[cryoprecipitate]] and [[fresh frozen plasma]] are commonly used coagulation factor products. [[Factor VII|Recombinant activated human factor VII]] is increasingly popular in the treatment of major bleeding.

[[Tranexamic acid]] and [[aminocaproic acid]] inhibit fibrinolysis, and lead to a ''de facto'' reduced bleeding rate. Before its withdrawal, [[aprotinin]] was used in some forms of major surgery to decrease bleeding risk and need for blood products.

===Anticoagulants===
{{main|Antiplatelet drug|Anticoagulant}}

Anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents are amongst the most commonly used medications. [[Antiplatelet drug|Anti-platelet agents]] include [[aspirin]], [[dipyridamole]], [[ticlopidine]], [[clopidogrel]], [[ticagrelor]] and [[prasugrel]]; the parenteral [[glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors]] are used during [[angioplasty]]. Of the anticoagulants, [[warfarin]] (and related [[coumarin]]s) and [[heparin]] are the most commonly used. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX,X) and protein C and protein S, whereas heparin and related compounds increase the action of antithrombin on thrombin and factor Xa. A newer class of drugs, the [[direct thrombin inhibitor]]s, is under development; some members are already in clinical use (such as [[lepirudin]]). Also under development are other small molecular compounds that interfere directly with the enzymatic action of particular coagulation factors (e.g., [[rivaroxaban]], [[dabigatran]], [[apixaban]]).<ref name="pmid22345595">{{cite journal |author=Soff GA |title=A new generation of oral direct anticoagulants |journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=569–74 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22345595 |doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.242834}}</ref>

==History==
===Initial discoveries===
Theories on the coagulation of blood have existed since antiquity. Physiologist [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]] (1801–1858) described fibrin, the substance of a [[thrombus]]. Its soluble precursor, [[fibrinogen]], was thus named by [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902), and isolated chemically by [[Prosper Sylvain Denis]] (1799–1863). [[Alexander Schmidt (physiologist)|Alexander Schmidt]] suggested that the conversion from fibrinogen to fibrin is the result of an [[enzyme|enzymatic]] process, and labeled the hypothetical enzyme "[[thrombin]]" and its precursor "[[prothrombin]]".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmidt A|year=1872|title=Neue Untersuchungen ueber die Fasserstoffesgerinnung |journal=Pflüger's Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie|volume=6|pages=413–538|doi=10.1007/BF01612263}}</ref><ref>Schmidt A.

The theory that thrombin is generated by the presence of [[tissue factor]] was consolidated by [[Paul Morawitz]] in 1905.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morawitz P|title=Die Chemie der Blutgerinnung|journal=Ergebn Physiol|year=1905|volume=4|pages=307–422}}</ref> At this stage, it was known that ''thrombokinase/thromboplastin'' (factor III) is released by damaged tissues, reacting with ''prothrombin'' (II), which, together with [[calcium in biology|calcium]] (IV), forms ''thrombin'', which converts fibrinogen into ''fibrin'' (I).<ref name=Giangrande>{{cite journal |author=Giangrande PL |title=Six characters in search of an author: the history of the nomenclature of coagulation factors |journal=Br.

===Coagulation factors===
The remainder of the biochemical factors in the process of coagulation were largely discovered in the 20th century.

A first clue as to the actual complexity of the system of coagulation was the discovery of ''proaccelerin'' (initially and later called Factor V) by Paul Owren (1905–1990) in 1947. He also postulated its function to be the generation of accelerin (Factor VI), which later turned out to be the activated form of V (or Va); hence, VI is not now in active use.<ref name=Giangrande/>

Factor VII (also known as ''serum prothrombin conversion accelerator'' or ''proconvertin'', precipitated by barium sulfate) was discovered in a young female patient in 1949 and 1951 by different groups.

[[Factor VIII]] turned out to be deficient in the clinically recognised but etiologically elusive [[haemophilia A|hemophilia A]]; it was identified in the 1950s and is alternatively called ''antihemophilic globulin'' due to its capability to correct hemophilia A.<ref name=Giangrande/>

Factor IX was discovered in 1952 in a young patient with [[haemophilia B|hemophilia B]] named [[Stephen Christmas]] (1947–1993). His deficiency was described by Dr. Rosemary Biggs and Professor [[R.G. MacFarlane]] in Oxford, UK. The factor is, hence, called Christmas Factor. Christmas lived in Canada, and campaigned for blood transfusion safety until succumbing to transfusion-related [[AIDS]] at age 46. An alternative name for the factor is ''plasma thromboplastin component'', given by an independent group in California.<ref name=Giangrande/>

Hageman factor, now known as factor XII, was identified in 1955 in an asymptomatic patient with a prolonged bleeding time named of John Hageman. Factor X, or Stuart-Prower factor, followed, in 1956. This protein was identified in a Ms. Audrey Prower of London, who had a lifelong bleeding tendency. In 1957, an American group identified the same factor in a Mr. Rufus Stuart. Factors XI and XIII were identified in 1953 and 1961, respectively.<ref name=Giangrande/>

The view that the coagulation process is a "cascade" or "waterfall" was enunciated almost simultaneously by MacFarlane<ref name="pmid14167839">{{cite journal |author=MacFarlane RG |title=An enzyme cascade in the blood clotting mechanism, and its function as a biochemical amplifier |journal=Nature |volume=202 |issue= 4931|pages=498–9 |year=1964 |pmid=14167839 |doi=10.1038/202498a0}}</ref> in the UK and by Davie and Ratnoff<ref name="pmid14173416">{{cite journal |author=Davie EW, Ratnoff OD |title=Waterfall sequence for intrinsic blood clotting |journal=Science |volume=145 |issue= 3638|pages=1310–2 |year=1964 |pmid=14173416 |doi=10.1126/science.145.3638.1310}}</ref> in the USA, respectively.

===Nomenclature===
The usage of [[Roman numeral]]s rather than eponyms or systematic names was agreed upon during annual conferences (starting in 1955) of hemostasis experts. In 1962, consensus was achieved on the numbering of factors I-XII.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wright IS |title=The Nomenclature of Blood Clotting Factors |journal=Can Med Assoc J |volume=86 |issue= 8|pages=373–4 |year=1962 |pmid=14008442 |doi= |pmc=1848865}}</ref> This committee evolved into the present-day International Committee on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ICTH). Assignment of numerals ceased in 1963 after the naming of Factor XIII. The names Fletcher Factor and Fitzgerald Factor were given to further coagulation-related proteins, namely [[prekallikrein]] and [[high-molecular-weight kininogen]], respectively.<ref name=Giangrande/>

Factors III and VI are unassigned, as thromboplastin was never identified, and actually turned out to consist of ten further factors, and accelerin was found to be activated Factor V.

==Other species==
All mammals have an extremely closely related blood coagulation process, using a combined cellular and serine protease process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In fact, it is possible for any mammalian coagulation factor to "cleave" its equivalent target in any other mammal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The only non-mammalian animal known to use serine proteases for blood coagulation is the [[horseshoe crab]].<ref name="pmid15170505">{{cite journal |author=Osaki T, Kawabata S |title=Structure and function of coagulogen, a clottable protein in horseshoe crabs |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences : CMLS |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=1257–65 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15170505 |doi=10.1007/s00018-004-3396-5 |url=}}</ref>
