[[File:Low Ca2+ buffering and excitotoxicity under physiological stress and pathophysiological conditions in motor neuron (MNs).jpg|thumb|400px|'''Low Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and excitotoxicity under physiological stress and pathophysiological conditions in motor neuron (MNs).''' Low Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) vulnerable hypoglossal MNs exposes mitochondria to higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads compared to highly buffered cells. Under normal physiological conditions, the neurotransmitter opens glutamate, NMDA and AMPA receptor channels, and [[VDCC|voltage dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]] (VDCC) with high glutamate release, which is taken up again by EAAT1 and EAAT2. This results in a small rise in intracellular calcium that can be buffered in the cell. In ALS, a disorder in the glutamate receptor channels leads to high calcium conductivity, resulting in high Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads and increased risk for mitochondrial damage. This triggers the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then inhibit glial EAAT2 function. This leads to further increases in the glutamate concentration at the synapse and further rises in postsynaptic calcium levels, contributing to the selective vulnerability of MNs in ALS.

'''Excitotoxicity''' is the pathological process by which [[neuron|nerve cells]] are damaged and killed by excessive stimulation by [[neurotransmitter]]s such as glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when [[cell surface receptor|receptors]] for the excitatory neurotransmitter [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] ([[glutamate receptor]]s) such as the [[NMDA receptor]] and [[AMPA receptor]] are overactivated by Glutamatergic Storm. Excitotoxins like [[NMDA]] and [[kainic acid]] which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of [[calcium in biology|calcium]] ions<ref name="Manev">Manev H, Favaron M, Guidotti A, and Costa E.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including [[phospholipase]]s, [[endonuclease]]s, and [[proteases]] such as [[calpain]].  These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the [[cytoskeleton]], [[cell membrane|membrane]], and DNA.

Excitotoxicity may be involved in [[spinal cord injury]], [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[hearing loss]] (through [[Noise-induced hearing loss|noise overexposure]] or [[ototoxicity]]) and in [[neurodegenerative disease]]s of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[Parkinson's disease]], [[alcoholism]] or [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]] and especially [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]], and also [[Huntington's disease]].<ref name="Kim">Kim AH, Kerchner GA, and Choi DW.

==History==
The harmful effect of glutamate upon the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] were first observed in 1954 by [[T. Hayashi]], a Japanese scientist who noted that direct application of glutamate to the CNS caused [[seizure]] activity, though this report went unnoticed for several years. The toxicity of glutamate was then observed by [[D. R. Lucas]] and [[J. P. Newhouse]] in 1957, when the subcutaneous injection of [[monosodium glutamate]] to newborn [[mouse|mice]] destroyed the neurons in the inner layers of the [[retina]].<ref name="Lucas">{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = DR | last2 = Newhouse | first2 = JP | title = The toxic effect of sodium L-glutamate on the inner layers of the retina. | journal = A.M.A. Archives of ophthalmology | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–201 | year = 1957 | pmid = 13443577 }}</ref> Later, in 1969, [[John Olney]] discovered the phenomenon was not restricted to the retina, but occurred throughout the [[brain]], and coined the term excitotoxicity. He also assessed that [[cell death]] was restricted to [[postsynaptic]] neurons, that glutamate [[agonist]]s were as neurotoxic as their efficiency to activate glutamate receptors, and that glutamate [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s could stop the neurotoxicity.<ref name="Olney">{{cite journal | last1 = Olney | first1 = JW | title = Brain lesions, obesity, and other disturbances in mice treated with monosodium glutamate. | journal = Science | volume = 164 | issue = 3880 | pages = 719–21 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5778021 | doi=10.1126/science.164.3880.719}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Excitotoxicity can occur from substances produced within the body ([[endogenous]] excitotoxins). Glutamate is a prime example of an excitotoxin in the brain, and it is also the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS.<ref name="Temple">Temple MD, O'Leary DM, and Faden AI.

Co-edited by Newcomb JK.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York. 2001. Pages 87-113.</ref> During normal conditions, glutamate [[concentration]] can be increased up to 1[[molar concentration|mM]] in the [[synaptic cleft]], which is rapidly decreased in the lapse of milliseconds.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=1359647 | year=1992 | last1=Clements | first1=JD | last2=Lester | first2=RA | last3=Tong | first3=G | last4=Jahr | first4=CE | last5=Westbrook | first5=GL | title=The time course of glutamate in the synaptic cleft | volume=258 | issue=5087 | pages=1498–501 | journal=Science | doi=10.1126/science.1359647 }}</ref> When the glutamate concentration around the synaptic cleft cannot be decreased or reaches higher levels, the neuron kills itself by a process called [[apoptosis]].<ref>Derek D. Yang et al, "Absence of excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus of mice lacking the Jnk3 gene" ''Nature'' 389, 865-870 (23 October 1997) {{doi|10.1038/39899}}.</ref> <ref>Maria Ankarcrona, et al, "Glutamate-induced neuronal death: A succession of necrosis or apoptosis depending on mitochondrial function", ''Neuron'', Volume 15, Issue 4, 961-973, 1 October 1995, {{doi|10.1016/0896-6273(95)90186-8}}</ref>

This pathologic phenomenon can also occur after [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]] and [[spinal cord injury]]. Within minutes after spinal cord injury, damaged neural cells within the lesion site spill glutamate into the extracellular space where glutamate can stimulate presynaptic glutamate receptors to enhance the release of additional glutamate.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hulsebosch  ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | month = Apr | title = Mechanisms of chronic central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury | url = | journal = Brain Res Rev | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 202–13 }}</ref>[[Traumatic brain injury|Brain trauma]] or [[stroke]] can cause  [[ischemia]], in which [[blood]] flow is reduced to inadequate levels. Ischemia is followed by accumulation of glutamate and [[aspartate]] in the [[extracellular fluid]], causing cell death, which is aggravated by lack of [[oxygen]] and [[glucose]]. The [[biochemical cascade]] resulting from ischemia and involving excitotoxicity is called the [[ischemic cascade]].  Because of the events resulting from ischemia and glutamate receptor activation, a deep [[induced coma|chemical coma]] may be induced in patients with brain injury to reduce the metabolic rate of the brain (its need for oxygen and glucose) and save energy to be used to remove glutamate [[active transport|actively]]. (The main aim in induced comas is to reduce the [[intracranial pressure]], not brain [[metabolism]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Increased extracellular glutamate levels leads to the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable NMDA receptors on myelin sheaths and [[oligodendrocytes]], leaving oligodendrocytes susceptible to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes and subsequent excitotoxicity. <ref>Nakamura et al, "S-nitrosylation of Drp1 links excessive mitochondrial fission to neuronal injury in neurodegeneration" ''Mitochondrion", 2010 Aug;10(5):573-8</ref> <ref>{{cite journal | author = Dutta  ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | month = Jan | title = Mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Prog Neurobiol | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 1–12 }}</ref> One of the damaging results of excess calcium in the cytosol is initiating apoptosis through cleaved [[caspase]] processing. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Dutta  ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | month = Jan | title = Mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Prog Neurobiol | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 1–12 }}</ref> Another damaging result of excess calcium in the cytosol is the opening of the [[mitochondrial permeability transition]] pore, a pore in the membranes of [[mitochondria]] that opens when the organelles absorb too much calcium.  Opening of the pore may cause mitochondria to swell and release [[reactive oxygen species]] and other proteins that can lead to [[apoptosis]].  The pore can also cause mitochondria to release more calcium.  In addition, production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) may be stopped, and [[ATP synthase]] may in fact begin [[hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] ATP instead of producing it.<ref name="Stavrovskaya">{{cite journal | last1 = Stavrovskaya | first1 = IG | last2 = Kristal | first2 = BS | title = The powerhouse takes control of the cell: is the mitochondrial permeability transition a viable therapeutic target against neuronal dysfunction and death? | journal = Free radical biology & medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 687–97 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15721979 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.11.032 }}</ref>

Inadequate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production resulting from brain trauma can eliminate [[electrochemical gradient]]s of certain ions.  [[Glutamate transporter]]s require the maintenance of these ion gradients to remove glutamate from the extracellular space.  The loss of ion gradients results in not only the halting of glutamate uptake, but also the reversal of the transporters. The Na<sup>+</sup>-glutamate transporters on neurons and astrocytes can reverse their glutamate transport and start secreting glutamate at a concentration capable of inducing excitotoxicity. <ref>Li et al, "Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibition and depolarization induce glutamate release via reverse Na+-dependent transport in spinal cord white matter" ''Neuroscience'' 107, 675–683</ref> This results in a buildup of glutamate and further damaging activation of glutamate receptors.<ref name="siegel">Siegel, G J, Agranoff, BW, Albers RW, Fisher SK, Uhler MD, editors.

On the [[molecular biology|molecular]] level, calcium influx is not the only factor responsible for apoptosis induced by excitoxicity. Recently,<ref name="Hardingham">{{cite journal | last1 = Hardingham | first1 = GE | last2 = Fukunaga | first2 = Y | last3 = Bading | first3 = H | title = Extrasynaptic NMDARs oppose synaptic NMDARs by triggering CREB shut-off and cell death pathways | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 405–14 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11953750 | doi = 10.1038/nn835 }}</ref> it has been noted that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, triggered by both glutamate exposure or hypoxic/ischemic conditions, activate a [[CREB]] ([[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] response element binding) [[protein]] shut-off, which in turn caused loss of [[mitochondrial membrane]] potential and apoptosis. On the other hand, activation of synaptic NMDA receptors activated only the CREB [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]], which activates [[BDNF]] (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), not activating apoptosis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
