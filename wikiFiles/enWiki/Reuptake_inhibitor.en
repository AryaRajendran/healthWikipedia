A '''reuptake inhibitor''' ('''RI'''), also known as a '''transporter blocker''', is a [[drug]] that inhibits the [[plasmalemma]]l [[transporter]]-mediated [[reuptake]] of a [[neurotransmitter]] from the [[synapse]] into the [[Synapse|pre-synaptic neuron]], leading to an increase in the [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of the [[neurotransmitter]] and therefore an increase in [[neurotransmission]]. Various [[drug]]s utilize reuptake inhibition to exert their [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] effects, including many [[antidepressants]] and [[psychostimulant]]s.<ref name="pmid16402124">{{cite journal | author = Iversen L. | title = Neurotransmitter transporters and their impact on the development of psychopharmacology. | journal = Br J Pharmacol. | volume = 147 | issue = 1 | pages = S82–88 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16402124 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706428 | pmc = 1760736 }}</ref>

[[Image:Tiagabine.svg|thumb|right|160px|[[Tiagabine]], a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor used as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of epilepsy and seizures.]]

Standard reuptake inhibitors are believed to act simply as [[competitive inhibition|competitive]] [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s that work by [[binding (molecular)|binding]] directly to the [[plasmalemma]] [[membrane transport protein|transporter]] of the [[neurotransmitter]] in question.<ref name="Norepinephrine and serotonin transporters: molecular targets of antidepressant drugs">{{cite book |last= Barker |first= Eric L. |coauthors= Randy D.

With high enough doses, [[receptor theory|occupation]] becomes as much as 80-90%.

===Vesicular transporter substrates===
[[Image:Reserpine.png|thumb|right|160px|[[Reserpine]], a vesicular reuptake inhibitor that was used in the past to deplete serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine stores as an antipsychotic and antihypertensive. It was notorious for causing anxiety and depression, and as a result, was replaced by newer, more modern drugs instead.]]

A second type of reuptake inhibition affects [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicular]] [[active transport|transport]], and [[receptor antagonist|block]]s the [[intracellular]] [[active transport|repackaging]] of [[neurotransmitter]]s into [[cytoplasmic]] vesicles. In contrast to [[plasmalemmal]] reuptake inhibitors, vesicular reuptake inhibitors do not increase the [[Synapse|synaptic]] [[concentration]]s of a [[neurotransmitter]], only the [[cytoplasmic]] [[concentration]]s; unless, that is, they also act as [[plasmalemmal]] [[transporter protein|transporter]] [[transporter reversal|reverser]]s via [[phosphorylation]] of the [[transporter protein]], also known as a [[releasing agent]]. Pure vesicular reuptake inhibitors tend to actually lower [[Synapse|synaptic]] [[neurotransmitter]] [[concentration]]s, as [[receptor antagonist|blocking]] the [[active transport|repackaging]] of, and [[Synaptic vesicle|storage]] of the [[neurotransmitter]] in question leaves them vulnerable to [[metabolism|degradation]] via [[enzyme]]s such as [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) that exist in the [[cytoplasm]]. With vesicular [[active transport|transport]] [[receptor antagonist|blocked]], [[neurotransmitter]] stores quickly become depleted.

[[Reserpine]] (Serpasil) is an [[irreversibility|irreversible]] and [[competitive inhibition|competitive]] inhibitor of the [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2), and is a classic example of a vesicular reuptake inhibitor.
