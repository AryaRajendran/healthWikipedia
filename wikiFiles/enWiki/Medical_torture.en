'''Medical torture''' describes the involvement and sometimes active participation of medical professionals in acts of [[torture]], either to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments which will enhance torture, or as torturers in their own right. Medical torture may be called '''medical interrogation''' if it involves the use of their expert medical knowledge to facilitate [[interrogation]] or [[corporal punishment]], in the conduct of torturous [[human experimentation]] or in providing professional medical sanction and approval for the torture of prisoners. Medical torture also covers torturous scientific (or pseudo-scientific) experimentation upon unwilling human subjects.

==Medical ethics and international law==
It is generally accepted that medical torture fundamentally violates [[medical ethics]], which all medical practitioners are expected to adhere to.
* The [[Hippocratic Oath]] makes explicit statements against deliberate harm not in the patient's best interests. These statements are often translated as ''"I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgement"'' and ''"to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else's interest."'' (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]].)
* In response to the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on prisoners, which were declared at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] to be "crimes against humanity", the [[World Medical Association]] developed the [[Declaration of Geneva]] to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state "<nowiki>[I, the medical practitioner]</nowiki> will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity".
* The Nuremberg Trials also led to the emergence of the [[Nuremberg code]] which explicitly outlines the boundaries of acceptable medical experimentation.
* Additionally in response to the Nazi atrocities, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] of 1949 outright prohibits the torture of prisoners of war and other protected non-combatants.
* The [[World Medical Association]] [[Declaration of Tokyo (1975)]] [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/tokyo.html] makes a number of specific statements against torture, including "The doctor shall not ''countenance'', ''condone'' or ''participate in'' the practice of torture".
* Also the [[UN Convention Against Torture]], which applies not only to [[medical personnel|medical staff]], prohibits the use of [[torture]] under any circumstance. The text explicitly states there is no exception to this treaty under which torture is allowed.
* The UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UN.1982) applies specifically to medical and other health workers but it has no implementation mechanism to ensure enforcement. It is up to state, provincial, and national bodies to enforce the standards in the document.
* The development of [[command responsibility]] established [[legal liability|criminal liability]] for all people, including physicians, involved in [[crimes against humanity]].

There remain gaps in regulation relating to medical torture in many countries:

*  Government sponsored torture and organized violence, with the complicity and or participation of health personnel, is internationally prohibited yet these violations occur with impunity in a significant amount of cases. An example of this impunity is found in the [[Abu Ghraib|Abu Ghraib prison]] torture and prisoner scandal as well as documented by [[Amnesty International]].
* A higher standard of behaviour is expected of health professionals yet the [[UN Principles of Medical Ethics]] are not enforceable when governments are complicit in violations. This higher standard is reflected in the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence (above all do no harm), autonomy, justice, dignity and informed consent and these aren’t covered comprehensively by the [[UN Convention Against Torture]].

==Asserted instances==
* Between 1937 and 1945, Japanese medical personnel who were part of [[Unit 731]] participated in the torture killings of as many as 10,000 Chinese, Russian, American and other prisoners as well as Allied POWs during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|second Sino-Japanese War]].[http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html]
* During [[World War II]], [[Unit 731]] of the Japanese Imperial Army tried out various biological weapons on Chinese subjects.
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany conducted [[Nazi human experimentation|human medical experimentation]] on large numbers of people held in its concentration camps. In particular, [[Josef Mengele]]'s experiments on prisoners at [[Auschwitz]] earned him the nicknames "the Angel of Death" and "Dr. Death".
* Japanese surgeons also performed [[vivisection]] and other medical experiments to torture [[United States|American]] prisoners of war in several islands of the Pacific. [http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/medical-experiments.html] [http://www.nopukob.com/id27.htm]
* Between 1970 and 1971, mentally disorienting interrogation techniques were used against interned prisoners captured in [[Northern Ireland]], including [[white noise]]. The Irish government complained to the [[European Commission for Human Rights]], who found Britain guilty of torture; however the higher [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the British government's actions were "inhuman and degrading but did not constitute torture". [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/troubles/origins/internment.shtml]
* In Soviet mental hospitals, [[Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|used to hold political prisoners]], very unpleasant medications were given to these "patients" as a means of punishment.  A psychiatric diagnosis was devised to describe people who oppose government policies.
* In 1978, "Pisaot menuh" ("Human Experiments") were performed on seventeen [[political prisoner]]s held at the infamous prison [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]] in [[Phnom Penh]] under the [[Khmer Rouge]].
* A study called "The Aversion Project" found that gay conscripts in the [[South African Defence Force]]s (SADF) during the [[apartheid]] era had been forced to submit to "curing" their homosexuality, both by electroshock therapies and by botched [[sex change]]s.
* There have been numerous claims that [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Leukotomy|prefrontal lobotomies]] and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient's best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic example of this is the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the [[Lake Alice Hospital]]'s open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified electroconvulsive treatment. Some governments (e.g. [[Norway]] and [[New Zealand]]) have since begun paying reparations to patients who suffered such treatments. The [[World Health Organization]] has called for a ban on unmodified ECT, and states no form of it should be used on children.

==Asserted medical or professional complicity==
{{POV-section|date=November 2011}}
According to the [[Center for Constitutional Rights|Center for Constitutional Rights']] When Healers Harm campaign, health professionals were complicit in the torture and abuse of detainees during U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s "[[war on terror]]".  Health professionals, including medical doctors, psychiatrists, medical examiners, psychologists, and nurses, have been implicated in the torture and abuse of prisoners in [[CIA]] secret prisons and military detention centers, such as those in [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].

Among other things, health professionals are accused of:

* crafting abusive tactics and falsely legitimizing their use;
* advised interrogators on methods of abuse that would exploit prisoners’ vulnerabilities;
* using medical procedures to harm prisoners;
* gauging [[pain]] and monitoring interrogations that risked leaving prisoners in need of treatment;
* checking prisoners to certify that they were capable of surviving additional abuse;
* conditioning medical or mental health treatment on cooperation with interrogation;
* sharing confidential patient information that was used to harm patients;
* covering up evidence of torture and abuse; and
* turning a blind eye to cruel treatment.

To date, no state licensing boards or professional associations have investigated – or recognized, in some cases – abusive conduct by individual members of their professions.  In 2009, after years of denial, the [[American Psychological Association]] finally recognized that psychologists had engaged in torture.  However, the [[American Psychological Association]] has not recognized that psychologists were involved in the Bush Administration’s torture policy.  Some criticize the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] for failing to respond to allegations of “collusion between APA officials and the national security apparatus in providing ethical cover for psychologists’ participation in detainee abuse."[http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/]

Although the [[American Medical Association]] has made clear that physicians should not be involved in interrogations of any kind, it continues to insist that it has “no specific knowledge of doctors being involved in abuse or torture,” despite evidence to the contrary, including government documents and [[Office of Legal Counsel]] memos, a report by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and multiple accounts by survivors.[http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf][http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html]

Some other accounts of medical or professional complicity in torture include:
*The [[SERE]] ("Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape") program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for the "behavioral science consultants" who helped to devise [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]]'s interrogation strategy although he has emphatically denied that he had advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. The ''New Yorker'' notes that in November, 2001 Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at [[Bagram Air Base]], "supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters".
* A 2005 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] suggested that torture was routine under the appointed Iraqi government. [http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/ Human Rights Watch Report]
* Dr. [[J.C. Carothers]], British colonial Kenyan psychiatrist, has been implicated by some recent academic historians in designing interrogation of [[Mau Mau]] prisoners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} His advice was published by the Kenya Government as The Psychology of Mau Mau, in 1954.<ref>For discussion of Carothers involvement with [[Mau Mau]] in Kenya in the 1950s: {{cite book |last=McCulloch |first=Jock |year=1995 |title=Colonial Psychiatry and "the African Mind" |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FToFMwnBacQC&pg=PA64 64–74]}}</ref>
*Similarly, it has been implied that Interim [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister Dr. [[Ayad Allawi]] violated his obligation to medical ethics whilst serving as Western European chief of [[secret police]] for the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]]ist government of [[Saddam Hussein]]. However, the same sources allege that Allawi had abandoned his medical education at that point and his medical degree "was conferred upon him by the Baath party."

* The theme of the 2009 horror film [[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]] is that of a sadistic, psychopathic retired surgeon torturing three people by surgically connecting them mouth to rectum, forcing the last two to swallow the excrement of the person in front of them and physically beating all three of them if they try to rebel or escape.
* In the book [[Dearly Devoted Dexter]] by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]] the central antagonist is a character nicknamed 'Dr. Danco' who surgically removes all body parts not necessary for life from his victims as what is revealed to be forfeits in a twisted game of [[hangman (game)|hangman]], carrying out the operations with the victim conscious and watching the procedures in a mirror.
