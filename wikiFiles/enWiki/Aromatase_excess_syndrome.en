'''Aromatase excess syndrome''' ('''AES''' or '''AEXS'''), also sometimes referred to as '''familial hyperestrogenism''' or '''famlilial gynecomastia''', is a rare [[genetic disorder|genetic]] and [[endocrine disease|endocrine syndrome]] of unknown etiology which is characterized by an [[gene expression|overexpression]] of [[aromatase]], the [[enzyme]] responsible for the [[biosynthesis]] of the [[estrogen]] [[sex hormone]]s from the [[androgen]]s, in turn resulting in excessive levels of circulating estrogens and, accordingly, symptoms of [[hyperestrogenism]]. It affects both [[sex|sexes]], manifesting itself in [[male]]s as marked or complete [[phenotype|phenotypical]] [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] (with the exception of the [[genitalia]]; i.e., no [[pseudohermaphroditism]]), in whom it fits the definition of a form of [[intersex]], and in [[female]]s as [[feminization (biology)|hyperfeminization]].<ref name="pmid12843139">{{cite journal | author = Martin RM, Lin CJ, Nishi MY, ''et al.'' | title = Familial hyperestrogenism in both sexes: clinical, hormonal, and molecular studies of two siblings | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 88 | issue = 7 | pages = 3027–34 | year = 2003 | month = July | pmid = 12843139 | doi = | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12843139}}</ref><ref name="pmid9543166">{{cite journal | author = Stratakis CA, Vottero A, Brodie A, ''et al.'' | title = The aromatase excess syndrome is associated with feminization of both sexes and autosomal dominant transmission of aberrant P450 aromatase gene transcription | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 1348–57 | year = 1998 | month = April | pmid = 9543166 | doi = | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9543166}}</ref><ref name="Makowski2011">{{cite book | author = Gregory Makowski | title = Advances in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=u_ksaKq95jkC&pg=PT158 | accessdate = 24 May 2012 | date = 22 April 2011 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-387025-4 | page = 158}}</ref>

To date, 10 families with AES have been fully described in the [[medical literature]], of which 23 males and at least 6 females were characterized as displaying symptoms of the condition.<ref name="pmid12843139" /><ref name="pmid22319526">{{cite journal | author = Fukami M, Shozu M, Ogata T | title = Molecular bases and phenotypic determinants of aromatase excess syndrome | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 2012 | issue = | pages = 584807 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22319526 | pmc = 3272822 | doi = 10.1155/2012/584807 | url = }}</ref>

==Cause==
The root cause of AES is not entirely clear, but it has been elucidated that [[heredity|inheritable]], [[autosomal dominant]] [[genetic mutation]]s affecting ''[[CYP19A1]]'', the [[gene]] which encodes aromatase, are involved in its etiology.<ref name="pmid12843139" /><ref name="Makowski2011" /><ref name="pmid22319526">{{cite journal | author = Fukami M, Shozu M, Ogata T | title = Molecular bases and phenotypic determinants of aromatase excess syndrome | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 2012 | issue = | pages = 584807 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22319526 | pmc = 3272822 | doi = 10.1155/2012/584807 | url = }}</ref>

Observed [[physiological]] abnormalities of the condition include a dramatic overexpression of aromatase and, accordingly, excessive levels of estrogens such as [[estradiol]] and [[estrone]]<ref name="pmid15483104">{{cite journal | author = Binder G, Iliev DI, Dufke A, ''et al.'' | title = Dominant transmission of prepubertal gynecomastia due to serum estrone excess: hormonal, biochemical, and genetic analysis in a large kindred | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 484–92 | year = 2005 | month = January | pmid = 15483104 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2004-1566 | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15483104}}</ref> and a very high rate of peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens; in one study, cellular aromatase [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] expression was found to be at least 10 times higher in a female patient compared to the control, and the estradiol/[[testosterone]] ratio after an injection of testosterone in a male patient was found to be 100 times greater than the control.<ref name="pmid12843139" /> Additionally, in another study, [[androstenedione]], testosterone, and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) were found to be either low or normal in males, and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels were very low (likely due to suppression by estrogen, which has [[antigonadotropic]] effects as a form of [[negative feedback inhibition]] on sex steroid production in sufficiently high amounts),<ref name="pmid10997774">{{cite journal | author = de Lignières B, Silberstein S | title = Pharmacodynamics of oestrogens and progestogens | journal = Cephalalgia : an International Journal of Headache | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–7 | year = 2000 | month = April | pmid = 10997774 | doi = | url = http://cep.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10997774}}</ref> whereas [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels were normal.<ref name="pmid22319526" />

==Symptoms==

The [[symptom]]s of AES, in males, include [[heterosexual precocity]] ([[precocious puberty]] with phenotypically-inappropriate [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s; i.e., a fully or mostly [[feminization (biology)|feminized]] appearance), severe [[prepubertal]] or [[peripubertal]] [[gynecomastia]] (development of [[breast]]s in males before or around [[puberty]]), [[hypogonadism]] (dysfunctional [[gonad]]s), [[oligozoospermia]] (low [[sperm count]]), small [[testes]], [[micropenis]] (an ususually small penis), [[bone age|advanced bone maturation]], an earlier [[peak height velocity]] (an accelerated rate of growth in regards to [[human height|height]]),<ref name="pmid12053085">{{cite journal | author = Meinhardt U, Mullis PE | title = The aromatase cytochrome P-450 and its clinical impact | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 57 | issue = 5-6 | pages = 145–52 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12053085 | doi = 10.1159/000058374| url = }}</ref> and [[short stature|short final stature]] due to early [[epiphysis|epiphyseal closure]], and in females, [[isosexual precocity]] (precocious puberty with phenotypically-appropriate secondary sexual characteristics), [[macromastia]] (excessively large breasts), an [[enlarged uterus]], [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual irregularities]], and, similarly to males, accelerated bone maturation and short final height. [[Fertility]], though usually affected to one degree or another—especially in males—is not always impaired significantly enough to prevent [[sexual reproduction]], as evidenced by [[vertical transmission]] of the condition by both sexes.<ref name="pmid12843139" /><ref name="pmid9543166" /><ref name="Makowski2011" />

Individuals with AES are likely to be at a significantly higher risk for [[Cancer#Hormones|estrogen-sensitive cancer]]s such as [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[endometrial cancer]].<ref name="pmid20205115">{{cite journal | author = Czajka-Oraniec I, Simpson ER | title = Aromatase research and its clinical significance | journal = Endokrynologia Polska | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–34 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20205115 | doi = | url = http://www.endokrynologia.polska.viamedica.pl/en/zamow_art_pdf.phtml?id=35&indeks_art=474}}</ref><ref name="pmid11162945">{{cite journal | author = Persson I | title = Estrogens in the causation of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers - evidence and hypotheses from epidemiological findings | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 357–64 | year = 2000 | month = November | pmid = 11162945 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-0760(00)00113-8| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960-0760(00)00113-8}}</ref> At least one patient, a male with the condition, was reported as having developed [[carcinoma]] of the [[breast]].<ref name="pmid12843139" />

==Treatment==
Several treatments have been found to be effective in managing AES, including [[aromatase inhibitor]]s and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue]]s in both sexes, [[androgen replacement therapy]] with non-aromatizable androgens such as DHT in males, and [[progestogen]]s (which, by virtue of their antigonadotropic properties at high doses, suppress estrogen levels) in females. In addition, male patients often seek [[bilateral mastectomy]], whereas females may opt for [[breast reduction]] if warranted.<ref name="pmid12843139" /><ref name="pmid9543166" /><ref name="Makowski2011" />

Medical treatment of AES is not absolutely necessary, but it is recommended as the condition, if left untreated, can lead to excessively large breasts (which may necessitate surgical reduction), problems with fertility, and possibly an increased risk of estrogen-dependent cancers later in life.<ref name="pmid12843139" />
