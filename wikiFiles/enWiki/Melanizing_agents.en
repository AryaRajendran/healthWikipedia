'''Melanizing agents''' are drugs that increase sensitivity to [[solar radiation]] and promote re-pigmentation of de-pigmented areas of skin. [[Furocoumarin]]s stimulate [[melanocytes]] and induce their proliferation on activation by light. Melanizing agents sensitize the skin to sunlight. As a result, [[erythema]], [[inflammation]] and [[pigmentation]] occurs.

==Drugs==
[[Psoralen]] is a natural drug obtained from the fruit of ''[[Psoralea corylifolia]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of Psoralen|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/psoralen|publisher=The Free Medical Dictionary|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> [[Methoxsalen]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of Methoxsalen|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/methoxsalen|publisher=The Free Medical Dictionary|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> and [[Trioxsalen]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of Trioxsalen|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/trioxsalen|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> are synthetic psoralens. These drugs can be used either topically or orally.

===Topical therapy===
The drug solution is painted on the vitiliginous lesion and exposed to sunlight for around one minute. It is then occluded by a sunscreen ointment. The treatment should be undertaken for many weeks to obtain observable results. Longer exposure to sunlight might cause [[blister]]ing of skin, so the therapy should be undertaken in the direct supervision of a physician.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tripathi|first=J.D|title=Melanizing agents|publisher=Jaypee Publications|isbn=81-8448-085-7}}</ref>

===Oral therapy===
It is done in alternate days. After 2 hours of taking the oral dose of 20&nbsp;mg/day of a psoralen, skin is exposed to sunlight. Eyes, ears and other normally pigmented areas should be protected while spending time in the sun.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parrish|first=John|title=Photochemotherapy of Vitilago|url=http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=536465|work=Archives of Dermatology|publisher=JAMA Network}}</ref>
