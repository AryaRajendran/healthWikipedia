'''Spaghetti plots''' are a method of viewing data to visualize possible flows through systems.  Flows depicted in this manner appear like noodles, hence the coining of this term.<ref name="allen">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ev54lAwS2KIC&pg=PA128&dq=spaghetti+diagram+book&hl=en&ei=PPhbTbSDAcXPgAfJhfWVDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=spaghetti%20diagram%20book&f=false|author=Theodore T.

Visualizing flow in this manner can reduce inefficiency within the flow of a system.  In regards to animal populations and [[weather buoy]]s drifting through the [[ocean]], they are drawn to study distribution and migration patterns.  Within [[meteorology]], these diagrams can help determine confidence in a specific [[weather forecast]], as well as positions and intensities of [[high-pressure area|high]] and [[low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems.  They are composed of deterministic forecasts from [[atmospheric model]]s or their various ensemble members.  Within [[medicine]], they can illustrate the effects of drugs on patients during drug trials.

==Applications==

===Biology===
Spaghetti diagrams have been used to study why [[butterfly|butterflies]] are found where they are, and to see how topographic features (such as mountain ranges) limit their migration and range.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oa5m8gZcGjMC&pg=PA103&dq=spaghetti+diagram+history+book&hl=en&ei=92ldTdWCH5D3gAeTpYSPDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=spaghetti%20diagram%20history%20book&f=false|page=103|title=The Butterflies of North America: A Natural History and Field Guide|author=James A.

===Meteorology===

Within meteorology, spaghetti diagrams are normally drawn from [[ensemble forecasting|ensemble forecast]]s.  A [[meteorological]] variable e.g. [[pressure]], [[temperature]], or [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amount is drawn on a chart for a number of slightly different model runs from an ensemble. The model can then be stepped forward in time and the results compared and be used to gauge the amount of uncertainty in the forecast.  If there is good agreement and the contours follow a recognizable pattern through the sequence, then the confidence in the forecast can be high. Conversely, if the pattern is chaotic i.e. resembling a plate of [[spaghetti]] then confidence will be low.  Ensemble members will generally diverge over time and spaghetti plots are a quick way to see when this happens.

Spaghetti plots can be a more favorable choice compared to the mean-spread ensemble in determining the intensity of a coming [[cyclone]], [[anticyclone]], or upper level ridge or trough.  Because ensemble forecasts naturally diverge as the days progress, the projected locations of meteorological features will spread further apart.  A mean-spread diagram will take a mean of the calculated pressure from each spot on the map as calculated by each permutation in the ensemble, thus effectively smoothing out the projected low and making it appear broader in size but weaker in intensity than the ensemble's permutations had actually indicated.  It can also depict two features instead of one if the ensemble clustering is around two different solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/ens/spaghetti/spag_frame.htm|title=NCEP Medium-Range Ensemble Forecast (MREF) System Spaghetti Diagrams|author=[[Environmental Modeling Center]]|date=2003-08-21|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref>
