On either side of the [[Larynx|laryngeal]] orifice is a recess, termed the '''piriform sinus''' (also '''piriform recess''', '''pyriform sinus''', '''piriform fossa''', or '''smuggler's fossa'''), which is bounded medially by the [[aryepiglottic fold]], laterally by the [[thyroid cartilage]] and [[thyrohyoid membrane]]. The fossae are involved in speech.

The term "piriform," which means "pear-shaped," is also sometimes spelled "pyriform" (as in the diagram on this page.)

Deep to the mucous membrane of the piriform fossa lie the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] as well as the [[internal laryngeal nerve]], a branch of the [[superior laryngeal nerve]].<ref>Moore, K.L., & Agur, A.M.R (2007). ''Essential Clinical Anatomy: Third Edition.'' Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. ISBN 978-0-7817-6274-8</ref> The internal laryngeal nerve supplies sensation to the area, and it may become damaged if the mucous membrane is inadvertently punctured.

The piriform sinus is a subsite of the [[hypopharynx]]. This distinction is important for head and neck [[cancer staging]] and treatment.<ref>AJCC Cancer Staging Handbook: From the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Sixth Edition. Ed. Frederick L. Greene, M.D. page 48.</ref>

==Clinical significance==
It is a common place for food to become trapped; if foreign material becomes lodged in the piriform fossa of an infant, it may be retrieved  nonsurgically. If the area is injured (e.g., by a [[fish bone]]), it can give the sensation of food stuck in the throat.

The persistency of the piriform sinus (especially on the left side) is a common cause of acute thyroiditis in children and adolescents.
Local anesthesia can be given here because of the presence of internal laryngeal nerve underneath the [[mucous membrane]].
