The term '''alkaline diet''' (also known as the '''alkaline ash diet''', '''alkaline acid diet''', '''acid ash diet''', and the '''acid alkaline diet''') describes a group of loosely related diets based on the belief that certain foods can affect the [[acidity]] of bodily fluids, including the [[urine]] or [[blood]], and can therefore be used to treat or prevent diseases. Acidity is measured by the [[pH]] level of the bodily fluids. 

The relationship between diet and [[acid-base homeostasis]], or the regulation of the acid-base status of the body, has been studied for decades, though the medical applications of this theory have largely focused on changing the acidity of urine. Traditionally, this diet has advocated for avoiding [[meat]], [[poultry]], [[cheese]], and [[Food grain|grain]]s in order to make the urine more alkaline (higher pH), changing the environment of the urine to prevent recurrent [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs) and [[kidney stones]] (nephrolithiasis).  However, difficulties in effectively predicting the effects of this diet have led to [[medication]]s, rather than diet modification, as the preferred method of changing urine pH.  The "acid-ash" hypothesis has been considered a risk factor for [[osteoporosis]] by various scientific publications, though more recently, the available weight of scientific evidence does not support this hypothesis.

The term "alkaline diet" has also been used by [[alternative medicine]] practitioners, with the proposal that such diets treat or prevent [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], low energy levels as well as other illnesses. These claims are not supported by medical evidence and make assumptions about how alkaline diets function, contrary to current understandings of human [[physiology]].

==History==

The role of diet and its influence on the acidity of urine has been studied for decades, as [[physiologist]]s have studied the [[kidney]]'s role in the body's regulatory mechanisms for controlling the acidity of body fluids.  The French [[biologist]] [[Claude Bernard]] provided the classical observation of this effect when he found that changing the diet of [[rabbits]] from an [[herbivore]] (mainly plant) diet to a [[carnivore]] (mainly meat) diet changed the [[urine]] from more alkaline to more acid.  Spurred by these observations, subsequent investigations focused on the chemical properties and acidity of constituents of the remains of foods combusted in a [[bomb calorimeter]], described as [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]. The "dietary ash hypothesis" proposed that these foods, when [[metabolism|metabolized]], would leave a similar "acid ash" or "alkaline ash" in the body as those [[oxidized]] in [[combustion]].<ref name=Dwyer>{{cite journal |author=Dwyer J, Foulkes E, Evans M, Ausman L |title=Acid/alkaline ash diets: time for assessment and change |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=841–5 |year=1985 |month=July |pmid=4008836 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Nutrition scientists began to refine this hypothesis in the early 20th century, emphasizing the role of negatively charged particles ([[anion]]s) and positively charged particles ([[cation]]s) in food.  Diets high in [[chloride]], [[phosphates]] and [[sulfates]] (all of which are anions) were presumed to be acid forming, while diets high in [[potassium]], [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] (all of which are cations) were presumed to be alkaline forming.  Other investigations showed specific foods, such as [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[prunes]] and [[plums]] had unusual effects on urine pH. While these foods provided an alkaline ash in the laboratory, they contained a weak organic acid, [[hippuric acid]], which caused the urine to become more acidic instead.<ref name=Dwyer/>

== Medical aspects ==

=== Diet composition ===

According to the traditional theory underlying this diet, acid ash is produced by meat, poultry, cheese, [[fish]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and grains.  Alkaline ash is produced by fruits and vegetables, except cranberries, prunes and plums.  Since the acid or alkaline ash designation is based on the residue left on combustion rather than the acidity of the food, foods such as citrus fruits that are generally considered acidic are actually considered alkaline producing in this diet.<ref name=Cunningham>{{cite journal |author=Cunningham E |title=What impact does pH have on food and nutrition? |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=1816 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19782182 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.08.028 |url=}}</ref>

=== Historical uses ===

Historically, the medical application of this diet has largely focused on preventing recurrence of kidney stones as well as the prevention of recurrent UTIs, by relying on the recognized ability of this diet to affect urinary pH.  Years ago, this diet was used to adjust the acidity of the urinary environment that the stones formed in, and could theoretically help prevent stones from forming or the development of UTIs. However, the analytical methods that attempted to precisely calculate the effects of food on urinary pH were not precise except in very general terms, making effective use of this diet difficult. Therefore, [[medications]], which can more reliably alter the urine pH, rather than diet modification, have been the treatment of choice when trying to alter the pH of the urine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Sue|title=Basic Nutrition & Diet Therapy, 11th ed.|year=2001|publisher=Mosby|location=2001|isbn=0323005691|pages=414}}</ref>  While there have been recent improvements in recognizing different [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] that can affect acid [[excretion]] in the urine, the level of detail needed to predict the urinary pH based on diet is still daunting.  Precise calculations require very detailed knowledge of the nutritional components of every meal as well as the rate of absorption of nutrients, which can vary substantially from individual to individual, making effective estimation of urine pH still not currently feasible.<ref name=Remer>{{cite journal |author=Remer T |title=Influence of diet on acid-base balance |journal=Semin Dial |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=221–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10923348 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

=== Current hypotheses ===

More recently, it has been hypothesized that diets high in "acid ash" (acid producing) elements will cause the body to try to [[buffering agent|buffer]] (or counteract) any additional acid load in the body by [[bone resorption|breaking down bone]], leading to weaker bones and increased risk for [[osteoporosis]]. Conversely, "alkaline ash" (alkaline producing) elements will theoretically decrease the risk of osteoporosis. This theory has been advanced in a Position Statement of the [[American Dietetic Association]],<ref name=Cunningham/> in a publication of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]],<ref>Food and Nutrition Board. ''Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate (2005)'', [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10925&page=189 page 189]. National Academies Press.</ref> as well as other scientific publications,<ref name=Fenton2011NJ>{{cite journal |author=Fenton TR, Tough SC, Lyon AW, Eliasziw M, Hanley DA |title=Causal assessment of dietary acid load and bone disease: a systematic review &amp; meta-analysis applying Hill&#39;s epidemiologic criteria for causality |journal=Nutr J |volume=10 |issue= |pages=41 |year=2011 |pmid=21529374 |pmc=3114717 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-10-41 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/10//41}}</ref> which have stated foods high in potassium and magnesium such as fruits and vegetables may decrease the risk of osteoporosis through increased alkaline ash production. This acceptance of the acid-ash hypothesis as a major modifiable risk factor of osteoporosis by these publications, however, was largely made without significant critical review by high quality systematic analysis.<ref name=Fenton2009NJ/>

Recent [[systematic reviews]] have been published which have methodically analyzed the weight of available scientific evidence, and have found no significant evidence to support the acid-ash hypothesis in regards to prevention of osteoporosis.  A [[meta-analysis]] of studies on the effect of dietary phosphate intake contradicted the expected results under the acid-ash hypothesis with respect to calcium in the urine and bone metabolism. This result suggests use of this diet to prevent calcium loss from bone is not justified.<ref name=Fenton2009NJ>{{cite journal |author=Fenton TR, Lyon AW, Eliasziw M, Tough SC, Hanley DA |title=Phosphate decreases urine calcium and increases calcium balance: a meta-analysis of the osteoporosis acid-ash diet hypothesis |journal=Nutr J |volume=8 |issue= |pages=41 |year=2009 |pmid=19754972 |pmc=2761938 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-8-41 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/8//41}}</ref>  Other meta-analyses which have investigated the effect of total dietary acid intake have also found no evidence that acid intake increases the risk for osteoporosis as would be expected under the acid-ash hypothesis.<ref name=Fenton2011NJ/><ref name=Fenton2009BMR>{{cite journal |author=Fenton TR, Lyon AW, Eliasziw M, Tough SC, Hanley DA |title=Meta-analysis of the effect of the acid-ash hypothesis of osteoporosis on calcium balance |journal=J.

It has also been speculated that this diet may have an effect on [[muscle wasting]], [[growth hormone]] metabolism or [[back pain]], though there is no conclusive evidence to confirm these hypotheses.<ref name=Pizzorno>{{cite journal |author=Pizzorno J, Frassetto LA, Katzinger J |title=Diet-induced acidosis: is it real and clinically relevant? |journal=Br.

==Alternative medicine==

[[Alternative medicine]] practitioners have promoted a diet regimen which they call an "alkaline diet" as well, advocating its use in the treatment of various medical conditions including [[cancer]].<ref name=Cassileth>{{cite book|last=Cassileth|first=Carrie R.|title=Principles and Practice of Gastrointestinal Oncology|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0-7817-7617-1|pages=137}}</ref>   These claims have been mainly promoted on [[websites]], [[magazines]], [[direct mail]], and [[books]], and have been mainly directed at a [[layperson|lay]] audience.<ref name=Fenton2011NJ/>  While it has been proposed that this diet can help increase energy, lose weight, and treat cancer and [[heart disease]], there is no evidence to support any of these claims.<ref name=CCS>{{cite web|title=An alkaline diet and cancer|url=http://www.cancer.ca/Canada-wide/About%20cancer/Cancer%20myths/Alkaline%20diet.aspx?sc_lang=EN|publisher=[[Canadian Cancer Society]]|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>  This version of the diet, in addition to avoiding meats and other proteins, also advocates avoiding processed foods, white sugar, white flour, and caffeine,<ref name=WebMD/> and can involve specific exercise and nutritional supplement regimens as well.<ref name=AND/>

=== Proposed mechanism, effects, and evidence basis ===

Advocates for alternative uses of an alkaline diet propose that since the normal pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, the goal of diet should be to mirror this by eating a diet that is alkaline producing as well.  These advocates propose that diets high in acid producing elements will lead the body in general to become acidic, which can foster disease.<ref name=CCS/><ref name=WebMD/> This proposed mechanism, in which the diet can significantly change the acidity of the blood, goes against "everything we know about the chemistry of the human body" and has been called a "myth" in a statement by the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]].<ref name=AICR>{{cite web|title=Cancer and Acid-Base Balance: Busting the Myth|url=http://preventcancer.aicr.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=13441|publisher=[[American Institute for Cancer Research]]|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>  Unlike the pH level in the urine, a selectively alkaline diet has not been shown to elicit a sustained change in blood pH levels, nor to provide the clinical benefits claimed by its proponents. Because of the body's natural regulatory mechanisms, which do not require a special diet to work, eating an alkaline diet can, at most, change the blood pH minimally and transiently.<ref name="intelihealth">{{cite web | url = http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH?d=dmtHMSContent&c=465747&p=~br,IHW|~st,24479|~r,WSIHW000|~b,* | title = Alkaline Diets and Cancer: Fact or Fiction? | first = Stephanie | last = Vangsness | publisher = Intelihealth | date = December 20, 2010 | accessdate = February 22, 2012}}</ref><ref name=CCS/><ref name=WebMD/><ref name=AICR/>

A similar proposal by those advocating this diet suggests that cancer grows in an acidic environment, and that a proper alkaline diet can change the environment of the body to treat cancer.  This proposal ignores the fact that while cancer tissue does grow in acidic [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], it is the cancer that creates the acidity. The rapid growth of cancer cells creates the acidic environment; the acidic environment does not create cancer.<ref name=Cassileth/>  The proposal also neglects to recognize that it is "virtually impossible" to create a less acidic environment in the body.<ref name=AICR/>  "Extreme" dietary plans such as this diet have more risks than benefits for patients with cancer.<ref name=Cassileth/>

Other proposed benefits from eating an alkaline diet are likewise not supported by scientific evidence.  Although it has been proposed that this diet will increase "energy" or treat [[cardiovascular disease]], there is no evidence to support these assertions.<ref name=CCS/>  A version of this diet has also been promoted by [[Robert O. Young]] as a method of [[weight loss]] in his book ''The pH Miracle''.  According to the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]], portions of his diet such as the emphasis on eating green leafy vegetables and [[exercise]] would likely be healthy. However, the "obscure theory" on which his diet is based and the reliance on complicated [[fasting]] regimens and [[nutritional supplements]] means that this diet "is not a healthy way to lose weight."<ref name=AND>{{cite web|title=The pH Miracle for Weight Loss Book Review|url=http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=10484#.UCWWzvXNlfs|publisher=[[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>  It has also been proposed that acid causes [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[osteoarthritis]], and that an alkaline diet can be used to treat these conditions. There is no evidence to support this proposal.<ref name=WebMDArthritis>{{cite web|last=Skarnulis|first=Leanna|title=Arthritis diets and supplements: Do they work?|url=http://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/guide/arthritis-diets-supplements|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> 

Urinary and/or [[saliva]] testing for acidity has been proposed as a way to measure the body's acidity level and therefore the level of risk for diseases.<ref name=Fenton2011NJ/>  However, there is no correlation between the urinary pH measured in home "test kits" and the acidity of the body.<ref name=AICR/>

=== Diet fraud ===

According to [[WebMD]], internet [[search engine]] results for "alkaline diet" have characteristics of possible diet fraud. Signs of possible [[fraud]]ulent promotion of this diet include subscription fees for information or advertisement of products sold only by that website. Other warning signs include severe restriction on the diet such as elimination of all [[fat]]s or [[carbohydrates]], as well as [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] alleging secrets kept from the public by the [[scientific community]], or a secret or discovery known only to the operator of the website.<ref name=WebMD/>

== Possible disadvantages ==
Because the alkaline diet promotes excluding certain families of foods, it could result in a less-balanced diet with resulting nutrient deficiencies such as [[essential fatty acids]], [[phytonutrients]],<ref name="intelihealth"/> as well as protein and calcium.<ref name=WebMD/>  It has been recommended that patients with a history of [[kidney]] disorders or other medical conditions that require frequent physician monitoring such as severe [[diabetes mellitus]] should not attempt this diet without [[physician]] supervision as you can run the risk of low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]) with this type of diet.<ref name=WebMD/>

[[D. C. Jarvis]], known for his book on [[folk medicine]], promoted the use of apple cider vinegar to keep the acidity of the body more acidic than alkaline, which he believed treated medical problems like [[burn]]s and [[varicose vein]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Ann Lyons|title=The Vermont Encyclopeida|year=2003|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover, N.H.|isbn=1-58465-086-9|pages=170|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&pg=PA170&lpg=PA170&dq=%22d.+c.+jarvis%22+alkaline&source=bl&ots=AKRI1ilCYV&sig=sbE6DaIk5XoZ98XuuRmvIquqaaE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KMD9T-6qDYvU2QXxvPTWCg&ved=0CGoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22d.%20c.%20jarvis%22%20alkaline&f=false}}</ref> Another diet, called the [[Hay diet]], was developed by the American physician [[William Howard Hay]] in the 1920s and popularized in the 1930s.
