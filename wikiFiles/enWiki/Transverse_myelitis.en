'''Transverse Myelitis''' (Latin: ''myelitis transversa'') is a [[neurological]] disorder caused by an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] process of the [[spinal cord]], and can cause [[axonal]] [[demyelination]]. The name is derived from Greek {{transl|el|''myelón''}} referring to the "[[spinal cord]]", and the suffix ''[[wikt:-itis|-itis]]'', which denotes [[inflammation]].<ref name=Chamberlin_2005>{{cite book | editor = Chamberlin SL, Narins B | title = The Gale Encyclopedia of Neurological Disorders | publisher = Thomson Gale | location = Detroit | year = 2005 | pages = 1859–70| isbn = 0-7876-9150-X}}</ref> Transverse implies that the inflammation is across the thickness of the spinal cord.

== Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs as well as motor, sensory, and sphincter deficits. Severe back pain may occur in some patients at the onset of the disease. The [[symptom]]s and signs depend upon the level of the spinal cord involved and the extent of the involvement of the various [[long tracts]]. In some cases, there is almost total [[paralysis]] and sensory loss below the level of the lesion. In other cases, such loss is only partial.

* If the upper cervical cord is involved, all four limbs may be involved and there is risk of [[respiratory paralysis]] (segments C3,4,5 to diaphragm).
* Lesions of the lower cervical (C5–T1) region will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs, and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs.
* A lesion of the [[thoracic spinal cord]] (T1–12) will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs, presenting as a [[spastic diplegia]].
* A lesion of the lower part of the [[spinal cord]] (L1–S5) often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs.

The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts, but there is often a "sensory level" (at the [[sensory segmental level]] of the spinal cord below which sensation to pin or light touch is impaired). This has proven to be a reasonably reliable sign of the level of the lesion.[[Bladder paralysis]] often occurs and urinary retention is an early manifestation. Considerable pain often occurs in the back, extending laterally to involve the sensory distribution of the diseased spinal segments—so-called "radicular pain." Thus, a lesion at the T8 level will produce pain radiating from the spine laterally along the lower [[costal margins]]. These signs and symptoms may progress to severe weakness within hours. (Because of the acuteness of this lesion, signs of [[spinal shock]] may be evident, in which the lower limbs will be flaccid and areflexic, rather than spastic and hyperreflexic as they should be in [[upper motor neuron paralysis]].

Some patients have also described the feeling of their abdominal area being in a binder{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

However, within several days, this spinal shock will disappear and signs of [[spasticity]] will become evident.

==Causes==
Transverse myelitis can appear for several reasons. Sometimes the disorders classified as such can be referred to as "Transverse myelitis spectrum disorders"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pandit L | year = 2009 | month = Mar–Apr | title = Transverse myelitis spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Neurol India | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 126–33 | pmid = 19439840 | doi=10.4103/0028-3886.51278}}</ref>

In some cases, the disease is presumed to be caused by viral infections such as [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) and has also been associated with spinal cord injuries, immune reactions, [[schistosomiasis]] and insufficient blood flow through [[spinal cord]] vessels. Acute myelitis accounts for 4 to 5 percent of all cases of [[neuroborreliosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blanc F, Froelich S, Vuillemet F, ''et al.'' |title=[Acute myelitis and Lyme disease] |language=French |journal=Rev. Neurol. (Paris) |volume=163 |issue=11 |pages=1039–47 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18033042 |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-RN-11-2007-163-11-0035-3787-101019-200703533}}</ref>

A major differentiation or distinction to be made is a similar condition due to compression of the spinal cord in the spinal canal, due to disease of the surrounding vertebral column.

Another possible cause is dissection of the [[aorta]], extending into one or more of the spinal arteries.

Transverse myelitis can be a rare complication following [[cat scratch disease]].<ref>Dr [[Thomas Stuttaford]]; ''Cat nipped;Body And Mind;'' [[The Times]]; 26 August 1993</ref>
As well as it can be associated with : 
Bacterial Infections-Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Lyme borreliosis, syphilis (tabes dorsalis), tuberculosis.
Viral Infections-herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, enteroviruses (poliomyelitis, Coxsackie virus, echovirus), human T-cell, leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, rabies.
Post-Vaccination-Rabies, cowpox.
Multiple Sclerosis.
Paraneoplastic syndromes.
Vascular-Thrombosis of spinal arteries, vasculitis secondary to heroin abuse, spinal Arteriovenous malformations.

==Pathophysiology==
This [[demyelination]] arises [[idiopathic]]ally following [[infection]]s or [[vaccination]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Akkad W, Salem B, Freeman JW, Huntington MK |title=Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis following vaccination with nasal attenuated novel influenza A(H1N1) vaccine |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=67 |issue=8|pages=1018–20 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20697056 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.167|url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20697056}}</ref> or due to [[multiple sclerosis]].
One major theory posits that immune-mediated inflammation is present as the result of exposure to a [[virus|viral]] [[antigen]].

The lesions are [[inflammation|inflammatory]], and involve the [[spinal cord]] typically on both sides.
With acute transverse myelitis, the onset is sudden and progresses rapidly in hours and days.
The lesions can be present anywhere in the spinal cord, though they are usually restricted to only a small portion.

==Differential diagnosis==
The three main conditions to be considered in the [[differential diagnosis]] are: acute [[spinal cord trauma]], acute [[compressive lesion]]s of the spinal cord such as [[epidural metastatic tumour]], and [[infarction]] of the spinal cord, usually due to insufficiency of the [[anterior spinal artery]]. Lyme disease serology is indicated in patients with transverse myelitis keeping in mind that dissociation in Lyme antibody titers between the blood and the CSF is possible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walid MS, Ajjan M, Ulm AJ |title=Subacute transverse myelitis with Lyme profile dissociation |journal=Ger Med Sci |volume=6 |pages=Doc04 |year=2008 |pmid=19675732 |pmc=2703261 |url=http://www.egms.de/en/gms/2008-6/000049.shtml}}</ref>

From the symptoms and signs, it may be very difficult to distinguish acute transverse myelitis from these conditions and it is almost invariably necessary to perform an emergency [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scan or computerised tomographic ([[Computed tomography|CT]]) myelogram. Before doing this, routine [[x-ray]]s are taken of the entire spine, mainly to detect signs of [[metastatic]] disease of the vertebrae, that would imply direct extension into the [[epidural]] space and compression of the spinal cord. Often, such bony lesions are absent and it is only the MRI or CT that discloses the presence or absence of a compressive lesion.

A family physician seeing such a patient for the first time should immediately arrange transfer to the care of a [[neurologist]] or [[neurosurgeon]] who can urgently investigate the patient in hospital. Before arranging this transfer, the physician should be certain that [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] is not affected, particularly in high spinal cord lesions. If there is any evidence of this, methods of [[respiratory assistance]] must be on hand before and during the transfer procedure. The patient should also be [[catheter]]ized to test for and, if necessary, drain an over-distended bladder. A [[lumbar puncture]] can be performed after the MRI or at the time of CT myelography. [[Steroid]]s are often given in high dose at the onset, in hope that the degree of [[inflammation]] and swelling of the cord will be lessened, but whether this is truly effective is still debated.

The prognosis for significant recovery from acute transverse myelitis is poor in approximately 66% of the cases; that is, significant long-term disabilities will remain. Approximately 2% of these patients will, in later months or years, show lesions in other parts of the central nervous system, indicating, in retrospect, that this was a first attack of [[multiple sclerosis]].

==Prognosis==
Recovery from transverse myelitis is variable between individuals and also depends on the underlying cause. Some patients begin to recover between weeks 2 and 12 following onset and may continue to improve for up to 2 years. Other patients may never show signs of recovery.<ref> About one third of patients do not recover at all: These patients are often wheelchair-bound or bedridden with marked dependence on others for basic functions of daily living. [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/transversemyelitis/detail_transversemyelitis.htm Transverse Myelitis Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)]</ref> However, if treated early, some patients experience complete or near complete recovery. Treatment options also vary according to the underlying cause and one treatment option in some cases is plasmapheresis.
