The '''National Incident Management System''' ('''NIMS''') is a system used in the [[United States]] to coordinate [[emergency preparedness]] and [[incident management]] among various federal, state, and local agencies.

==History==
The NIMS is a structured framework used nationwide for both governmental and nongovermental agencies to respond to natural disasters or terrorist attacks at the local, state, and federal levels of government. 

The system's development was instigated on February 28, 2003 by President [[George W. Bush]], who in ''Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-5, Management of Domestic Incidents'' directed the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] to develop and administer the system. <ref>Bush, George W. [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030228-9.html "Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-5, Management of Domestic Incidents"] 28 February 2003</ref> After the proposed system went through a period of vetting and coordination among [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], NIMS was released by Homeland Security Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] on March 1, 2004.<ref>DHS Press Office.[http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0367.shtm "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge Approves National Incident Management System (NIMS)."] 1 March 2004</ref>

The 2003 presidential directive required all federal agencies to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation programs and activities. The directive also required federal departments to make adoption of NIMS by state, tribal, and local organizations a condition for federal preparedness assistance beginning in [[fiscal year]] 2005. In addition, all state, tribal, and local emergency personnel with a direct role in emergency preparedness, incident management or response were to have completed NIMS training by October 1, 2005. After the directive was adopted, all state, tribal and local personnel with any role in emergency response were given until October 1, 2006 to complete training for NIMS compliance.

There has been little empirical research conducted on NIMS. To date, there have only been four publications and one grant report based on original research on the subject: Neal and Webb (2006), Jensen (2011), Jensen and Yoon (2011), Jensen (2009), and Jensen (2008), respectively. Neal and Webb (2006) conducted quick response research in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to assess the degree to which federal and local government agencies used NIMS in the hurricane response. Also conducting quick response research, Jensen (2011) studied county implementation behavior related to NIMS through a survey completed by a national random sample of county emergency managers. Jensen and Yoon (2011) surveyed volunteer fire department chiefs and fire fighters in North Dakota related to their perceptions of ICS and NIMS. Jensen (2008) gathered data on the use and usefulness of NIMS at the local level in the wake of an EF3 tornado. Finally, Jensen (2009) researched county emergency manager interpretations and implementation of NIMS during routine times in three states. However, while there have only been three studies on the subject of NIMS, the findings from the studies overlap with one another significantly. These studies exhibit overlap in three areas including the following: the dependent variable of implementation behavior; the identification of independent variables; and, methodology. The NIMS literature also exhibits overlap with the policy implementation literature in these areas. 

==Concepts and principles==
NIMS is based on an appropriate balance of flexibility and standardization:
===Flexibility===
NIMS provides a consistent, flexible and adjustable national framework within which government and private entities at all levels can work together to manage domestic incidents, regardless of their cause, size, location or complexity.
===Standardization===
NIMS provides a set of standard organizational structures, as well as requirements for processes, procedures and systems designed to improve operability among jurisdictions and disciplines in various areas.

==NIMS components==
===Command and management===
NIMS standard incident command structures are based on three key organizational systems:
*The [[Incident Command System]]
*[[Multi-agency Coordination (MAC) System]]
*Public Information Systems

===Preparedness===
The range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities necessary to build, sustain, and improve the operational capability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. Preparedness is a continuous process. Preparedness involves efforts at all levels of government and between government and private-sector and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and identify required resources. Within the NIMS, preparedness is operationally focused on establishing guidelines, protocols, and standards for planning, training and exercises, personnel qualification and certification, equipment certification, and publication management.

===Resource management===
Efficient incident management requires a system for identifying available resources at all jurisdictional levels to enable timely and unimpeded access to resources needed to prepare for, respond to, or recover from an incident. Resource management under the NIMS includes mutual-aid agreements; the use of special Federal, State, local, and tribal teams; and resource mobilization protocols.

===Communications and information management===
NIMS requires incident management organizations to ensure that effective interoperable communications and information management processes, procedures and systems exist to support a wide variety of incident management activities across agencies and jurisdictions.
