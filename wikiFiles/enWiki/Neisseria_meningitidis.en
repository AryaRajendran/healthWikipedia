'''''Neisseria meningitidis''''', often referred to as '''''meningococcus''''', is a [[bacterium]] that can cause  [[meningitis]]<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | pages = 329&ndash;333 | isbn= 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> and other forms of [[meningococcal disease]] such as [[meningococcal disease#Meningococcemia|meningococcemia]], a life-threatening [[sepsis]]. ''N. meningitidis'' is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during childhood in industrialized countries and has been responsible for epidemics in Africa and in Asia.<ref name= GencoWetzler>{{cite book |author= Genco, C; Wetzler, L (editors)| year=2010 |title=Neisseria: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-51-6}}</ref> Upon [[Gram staining]], it appears as a [[Gram-negative]] [[diplococcus]] and cultures of the bacteria test positive for the enzyme [[cytochrome c oxidase]].<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/lab/Nmen.htm Neisseria meningitidis] at [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].

It exists as normal flora ([[wikt:nonpathogenic|nonpathogenic]]) in the [[nasopharynx]] of up to 5-15% of adults.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Courses/Bio_160/Projects1999/bmenin/nmenin.html |title = Neisseria meningitidis |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref> It causes the only form of bacterial [[meningitis]] known to occur [[epidemic]]ally. ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (aka ''pneumococcus'') is the most common bacterial etiology of meningitis in children beyond 2 months of age(1-3 per 100,000). Meningococci only infect humans and have never been isolated from animals because the bacterium cannot get iron other than from human sources ([[transferrin]] and [[lactoferrin]]).<ref name="Meningococcal Disease 2001">Meningococcal Disease (2001) Humana Press, Andrew J. Pollard and Martin C.J. Maiden</ref>

Meningococcus is spread through the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions during activities like coughing, kissing, and chewing on toys. It infects the host cell by sticking to it using [[Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA)]]. Though it initially produces general symptoms like [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], it can rapidly progress from fever, headache and [[neck stiffness]] to [[coma]] and death. The symptoms of meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other organisms such as ''[[Hemophilus influenzae]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''.<ref name=Mola/> Death occurs in approximately 10% of cases.<ref name="Meningococcal Disease 2001"/> Those with impaired immunity may be at particular risk of meningococcus (e.g. those with [[nephrotic syndrome]] or [[splenectomy]]; vaccines are given in cases of [[asplenia|removed or non-functioning spleens]]).

==History==
[[Anton Weichselbaum]] in 1887 first discovered the disease in patients infected with meningococci.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Deuren M, Brandtzaeg P, van der Meer JW |title=Update on meningococcal disease with emphasis on pathogenesis and clinical management |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=144–66 |month=January |year=2000 |pmc=88937 |pmid=10627495 |doi=10.1128/CMR.13.1.144-166.2000}}</ref>

== Subtypes ==
These are classified according to the [[antigen]]ic structure of their [[polysaccharide]] capsule.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}   Of the 12 groups of N. meningitidis have been identified, six of these (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) are able to cause [[epidemics]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/ |title=Meningococcal meningitis |first= |last= |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |work=who.int |year=2011 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>  Serotype distribution varies markedly around the world,<ref>[http://www.meningitisinfo.com/Epidemiology_ssi.aspx]</ref> with type A being most prevalent in Africa and Asia but practically absent in North America, most of Europe, and Oceania, where type B is the most common.  This variance, along with the technical difficulty to produce an effective type B vaccine, have hindered development of a universal vaccine for meningococcal disease.

==Epidemiology==
Approximately 2500 to 3500 cases of ''N. meningitidis'' infection occur annually in the United States, with a case rate of about 1 in 100,000. Children younger than 5 years are at greatest risk, followed by teenagers of high school age. Rates in sub-Saharan Africa can be as high as 1 in 1000 to 1 in 100.<ref name=Mola>{{cite journal |author=Mola SJ, Nield  LS, and Weisse ME|title=Treatment and Prevention of ''N. meningitidis'' Infection  |journal=Infections in Medicine |date=February 27, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/headache/article/1145625/1403886}}</ref>

== Virulence ==
Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a component of the [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] of ''N. meningitidis'' which acts as an [[endotoxin]] which is responsible for [[septic shock]] and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffiss JM, Schneider H, Mandrell RE, Yamasaki R, Jarvis GA, Kim JJ, Gibson BW, Hamadeh R, Apicella MA. |title=Lipooligosaccharides: the principal glycolipids of the neisserial outer membrane |journal=Rev Infect Dis |volume=10 Suppl 2 |pages=S287–95 |pmid=2460911 |year=1988}}</ref> Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide [[capsule (microbiology)|capsule]] which prevents host [[phagocytosis]] and aids in evasion of the host immune response; and [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbriae]] which mediate attachment of the bacterium to the [[epithelial cells]] of the [[nasopharynx]].<ref name= JarrellK>{{cite book |author= Jarrell, K (editor)| year=2009 |title=Pili and Flagella: Current Research and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-48-6}}</ref><ref name= UllrichM>{{cite book |author= Ullrich, M (editor)| year=2009 |title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-45-5}}</ref>

Recently a hypervirulent strain was discovered in China. Its impact is yet to be determined.<ref name=Mola/>

== Mechanisms of cellular invasion ==
''N. meningitidis'' is an intracellular human-specific pathogen responsible for [[septicemia]] and [[meningitis]]. Like most bacterial intracellular pathogens, ''N. meningitidis'' exploits host cell signaling pathways to promote its uptake by host cells. The signaling leading to bacterial internalization is induced by the [[type IV pili]], which are the main means of meningococcal adhesion onto host cells. The signaling induced following [[Type IV pilus]]-mediated adhesion is responsible for the formation of [[microvilli]]-like structures at the site of the bacterial-cell interaction.<ref name="JarrellK"/> These microvilli trigger the internalization of the bacteria into host cells. A major consequence of these signaling events is a reorganization of the [[actin]] [[cytoskeleton]], which leads to the formation of membrane protrusions, engulfing bacterial pathogens into intracellular [[vacuole]]s. Efficient internalization of ''N. meningitidis'' also requires the activation of an alternative signaling pathway coupled with the activation of the [[tyrosine kinase]] receptor [[ErbB2]]. Beside Type IV pili, other outer membrane proteins may be involved in other mechanism of bacteria internalization into cells.<ref name= Carbonnelle >{{cite book |author= Carbonnelle E et al.|year=2010|chapter=Mechanisms of Cellular Invasion of Neisseria meningitidis|title=Neisseria: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-51-6}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Suspicion of meningitis is a [[medical emergency]] and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis  or [[sepsis|septicaemia]] (infection of the blood) is suspected  intravenous antibiotics should be given  and the ill person admitted to the hospital.<ref>Health Protection Agency Meningococcus Forum (August 2006). Guidance for public health management of meningococcal disease in the UK. Available online at: http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947389261</ref> This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of ''Neisseria meningitidis'' as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced [[Mortality rate|chance of death]].

[[Septicaemia]] caused by ''Neisseria meningitidis'' has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths.<ref>Meningococcal Vaccines (2001) Humana Press, Andrew J. Pollard and Martin C.J. Maiden</ref>  Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a [[purpuric]] rash that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass ("non-blanching") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% [[mortality rate]] over a few hours from initial onset. Many health organizations advise anyone with a non-blanching rash to go to a hospital  as soon as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Note that not all cases of a [[purpura]]-like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia; however, other possible causes need prompt investigation as well (e.g. [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|ITP]] a [[platelet]] disorder or [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]]).

Other severe complications include'' [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]]'' (a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by [[Wiktionary:fulminant|fulminant]] meningococcemia), adrenal insufficiency, and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].<ref name=Mola/>

== Diagnosis ==
The gold standard of diagnosis is isolation of ''N. meningitidis'' from sterile body fluid.<ref name=Mola/> A [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) specimen is sent to the laboratory immediately for identification of the organism. Diagnosis relies on culturing the organism on a [[chocolate agar]] plate. Further testing to differentiate the species includes testing for [[oxidase]], [[catalase]] (all clinically relevant ''Neisseria'' show a positive reaction) and the [[carbohydrates]] [[maltose]], [[sucrose]], and [[glucose]] test in which ''N. meningitidis'' will ferment (that is, utilize) the glucose and maltose. [[Serology]] determines the [[serotype|subgroup]] of the organism.

If the bacteria reach the circulation, then [[blood cultures]] should be drawn and processed accordingly.

Clinical tests that are used currently for the diagnosis of meningococcal disease take between 2 and 48 hours and often rely on the culturing of bacteria from either blood or CSF samples. However, [[polymerase chain reaction]] tests can be used to identify the organism even after antibiotics have begun to reduce the infection. As the disease has a fatality risk approaching 15% within 12 hours of infection, it is crucial to initiate testing as quickly as possible but not to wait for the results before initiating antibiotic therapy.<ref name=Mola/>

== Treatment ==
Persons with confirmed ''N. meningitidis'' infection should be hospitalized immediately for treatment with antibiotics. Indeed, because meningococcal disease can disseminate very rapidly, a single dose of intramuscular antibiotic is often given at the earliest possible opportunity, even before hospitalization, if disease symptoms look suspicious enough.<ref name=Mola/>  Third-generation [[cephalosporin]] antibiotics (i.e. [[cefotaxime]], [[ceftriaxone]]) should be used to treat a suspected or culture-proven meningococcal infection before antibiotic susceptibility results are available.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tunkel AR, Hartman BJ, Kaplan SL, Kaufman BA, Roos KL, Scheld WM, Whitley RJ |title=Practice guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1267–84 |month=November |year=2004 |doi=10.1086/425368 |pmid=15494903}}</ref> Empirical treatment should also be considered if a lumbar puncture, to collect CSF for laboratory testing, cannot be done within 30 minutes of admission to hospital.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Antibiotic treatment may affect the results of microbiology tests,  but a diagnosis may be made on the basis of blood-cultures and clinical examination.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Prevention ==
All recent contacts of the infected patient over the 7 days before onset should receive medication to prevent them from contracting the infection. This especially includes young children and their child caregivers or nursery-school contacts, as well as anyone who had direct exposure to the patient through kissing, sharing utensils, or medical interventions such as [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. Anyone who frequently ate, slept or stayed at the patient's home during the 7 days before the onset of symptom, or those who sat beside the patient on an airplane flight or classroom for 8 hours or longer, should also receive [[chemoprophylaxis]] (the agent of choice is usually oral [[rifampicin]] for a few days).<ref name=Mola/>

===Vaccination===
{{main|Meningococcal vaccine}}
{{globalize|section|date=September 2012}}
There are currently three vaccines available in the U.S. to prevent meningococcal disease for people aged 2 or older. All three vaccines are effective against the same serogroups: A, C, Y, and W-135. Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV4) are licensed for use in the U.S. The first conjugate vaccine was licensed in 2005, the second in 2010. Conjugate vaccines are the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age. A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s and is the only meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. MPSV4 may be used in people ages 2 – 55 years old if the MCV4 vaccines are not available or contraindicated.  Information about who should receive the meningococcal vaccine is available from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).<ref>"Menningococcal Vaccines - What You Need to Know" (2008). Center for Disease Control and Prevention. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-mening.pdf</ref>

On June 14, 2012, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a new combination vaccine against two types of meningococcal diseases and [[Haemophilus influenzae|Hib]] disease for infants and children aged 6 weeks to 18 months old.  The vaccine, Menhibrix, will prevent disease caused by ''Neisseria meningitidis'' [[serotypes|serogroups]] C and Y, and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' type b.  This is the first meningococcal vaccine that can be given to infants as young as six weeks old.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm308350.htm?utm_campaign=Google2&utm_source=fdaSearch&utm_medium=website&utm_term=menhibrix&utm_content=1 ''FDA approves new combination vaccine that protects children against two bacterial diseases''], ''FDA Press Release'', June 14, 2012</ref>
