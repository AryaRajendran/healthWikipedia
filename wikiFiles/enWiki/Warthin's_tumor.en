'''Warthin's tumor''' or '''Warthin tumour''', also known as '''[[wiktionary:Papillary|papillary]] [[cystadenoma]] lymphomatosum''', monomorphic adenoma or adenolymphoma, is a type of [[benign]] [[tumor]] of the [[salivary glands]].

==Etiology==
Its [[etiology]] is unknown, but there is a strong association with cigarette [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]].  Smokers are at 8 times greater risk of developing Warthin's tumor than the general population.<ref name=robbins>{{cite book |author=Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N  |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease, 7 Ed |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, MO |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Locations==
The gland most likely affected is the [[parotid gland]].  Though much less likely to occur than [[pleomorphic adenoma]], Warthin's tumor is the second most common benign parotid tumor.

==Characteristic==

Warthin's tumor primarily affects older individuals (age 60&ndash;70 years). There is a slight female predilection according to recent studies, but historically it has been associated with a strong male predilection. This change is possibly due to the tumor's association with cigarette smoking and the growing use of cigarettes by women. The tumor is slow growing, painless, and usually appears in the tail of the parotid gland near the angle of the [[Human mandible|mandible]]. In 5&ndash;14% of cases, Warthin's tumor is bilateral, but the two masses usually are at different times. Warthin's tumor is highly unlikely to become [[malignant]].

==Histology==
The appearance of this tumor under the [[microscope]] is unique.  There are cystic spaces surrounded by two uniform rows of [[cell (biology)|cells]] with centrally placed [[pyknotic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclei]].  The cystic spaces have epithelium referred to as papillary infoldings that protrude into them.  Additionally, the epithelium has lymphoid stroma with [[germinal center]] formation.

The [[differential diagnosis]] includes [[sebaceous lymphadenoma]] and [[oncocytoma]].

==Treatment==
Most of these tumors are treated with [[surgical excision|surgical removal]]. It is non recurrent
.
