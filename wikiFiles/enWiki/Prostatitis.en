'''Prostatitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[prostate]] gland. Prostatitis is classified into acute, chronic, asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, and chronic pelvic pain syndrome.  

In the [[United States]], prostatitis is diagnosed in 8 percent of all [[urologist]] visits and 1 percent of all primary care physician visits.<ref name="pmid9507840">{{cite journal |author=Collins MM, Stafford RS, O'Leary MP, Barry MJ |title=How common is prostatitis?

==Classification==
The term ''prostatitis'' refers, in its strictest sense, to [[histological]] (microscopic) [[inflammation]] of the tissue of the [[prostate gland]]. Like all forms of inflammation, it can be associated with an appropriate response of the body to an infection, but it also occurs in the absence of infection.

In 1999, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ([[NIDDK]]) devised a new classification system.<ref name="pmid10422990">{{cite journal |author=Krieger JN, Nyberg L, Nickel JC |title=NIH consensus definition and classification of prostatitis |journal=JAMA |volume=282 |issue=3 |pages=236–7 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10422990 |doi= 10.1001/jama.282.3.236|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10422990}}</ref><ref name="Nickel1999">{{cite book|author=J.

| style="text-align: left"  |'''Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis''' patients have no history of genitourinary pain complaints, but [[leukocytosis]] is noted, usually during evaluation for other conditions. Between 6-19% of men have pus cells in their semen but no symptoms.<ref name="pmid18455767">{{cite journal |author=Korrovits P, Ausmees K, Mändar R, Punab M |title=Prevalence of asymptomatic inflammatory (National Institutes of Health Category IV) prostatitis in young men according to semen analysis |journal=Urology |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1010–5 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18455767 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2007.12.082 |url=}}</ref>

In 1968, Meares and Stamey determined a classification technique based upon the culturing of bacteria.<ref name="pmid4870505">{{cite journal |author=Meares EM, Stamey TA |title=Bacteriologic localization patterns in bacterial prostatitis and urethritis |journal=Invest Urol |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=492–518 |year=1968 |month=March |pmid=4870505 |doi= |url=}}</ref> This classification is no longer used.

The conditions are distinguished by the different presentation of pain, [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) in the urine, duration of symptoms and [[bacteria]] [[Microbiological culture|cultured]] from the urine. To help express prostatic secretions that may contain WBCs and bacteria, [[prostate massage]] is sometimes used.<ref name="urlProstatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary_disorders/benign_prostate_disease/prostatitis.html |title=Prostatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>
