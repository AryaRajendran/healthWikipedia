The [[immunochemistry]] of [[triticeae glutens|''Triticeae'' glutens]] is important in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), [[MHC class II|class II]] mediated presentation ([[HLA DQ]]), [[MHC class I|class I]] meditiated stimulation of [[killer cells]], and [[antibody]] recognition. The responses to [[gluten]] [[protein]]s and [[polypeptide]] regions differs according to the type of gluten sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the [[human leukocyte antigen]] genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, [[innate immunity]] (a form of cellular immunity priming), [[HLA-DQ]], and [[antibody]] recognition of [[gliadin]] and [[transglutaminase]]. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In [[wheat allergy]], the response pathways are mediated through [[IgE]] against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.

There is a growing body of evidence that the gluten-sensitive intestine differs from the normal gut, several gluten peptides can enter behind the brush border membrane cells. For example, a "33mer" of α-2 gliadin is a magnitude larger than the size exclusion of the tight junction, ω-5 gliadin peptides have been found in the blood stream of people with exercise-induced anaphylaxis, aided by salicylates. And the innate 25 is capable of reaching mononuclear cells in coeliac gut, but in normal gut is broken down by brush border peptidases. It may be this lower peptidase activity that explains the presence of these peptides behind the brush border membrane. Recently, it was found that an α-9 gliadin peptide was capable of binding the "CXCR3" receptor, increasing zonulin production and weakening tight junctions, this may explain how, generally, larger peptides can enter the gluten-sensitive gut.<ref name="pmid18485912">{{cite journal |author=Lammers KM, Lu R, Brownley J, ''et al.'' |title=Gliadin induces an increase in intestinal permeability and zonulin release by binding to the chemokine receptor CXCR3 |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=194–204.e3 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18485912 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.03.023 |url= |pmc=2653457}}</ref>

[[Innate immunity]] to [[gluten]] refers to an [[immune response]] that works independently of [[T-cell receptor]] or [[antibody]] recognition of the 'innate' peptide. This peptide acts directly on cells, such as monocytes, stimulating their growth and differentiation.<ref name="pmid16766754"/> Innate immunity to gluten is complicated by an apparent role gluten has in bypassing normal host defense and peptide exclusion mechanisms in the gut. While not truly innate, these activities allow gliadin to enter into areas where many lymphocytes patron. In bypassing these filters gliadin alters the normal behavior of both digestive cells, called [[enterocytes]] or epithelial cells, and lymphocytes. This increases the potential of causing sensitivity (see '''Underlying Conditions'''). One potential explanation of why certain people become sensitive is that these individuals may not produce adequate peptidases in some areas of the gut, allowing these peptides to survive. Other explanation for some may be that food chemicals or drugs are weakening the defenses. This can be the case with ω5-gliadin allergy with salicylate sensitivity. There is no clear reasoning, either from genetics or from long term studies of susceptible individuals why these gut peptide restrictions would change.

[[Image:A9-gliadin-innate.png|thumb|left|Illustration of the innate peptide and CXCR3 sites on alpha-9 gliadin]]
Once inside, α-9 gliadin 31-55 shows the ability to activate undifferentiated immune cells that then proliferate and also produce inflammatory hormones notably Interleukin 15.  This produces a number of downstream responses that are pro-inflammatory. The other peptide that may have innate behavior is the "CXCR3" receptor binding peptides, the receptor exists on enterocytes, the brush border membrane cells. The peptide displaces an immune factor and signals the disruption of the membrane seal, the tight junctions, between cells.

===Alpha gliadin 31-43===
Gluten bears an innate response peptide (IRP) found on α-9 gliadin, at positions 31-43 and on α-3, 4, 5, 8, and 11 gliadins. The IRP lies within a 25 amino-acid long region that is resistant to [[Exocrine pancreas|pancreatic protease]]s. The 25mer is also resistant to [[Brush border]] membrane [[peptidase]]s of the [[small intestine]] in coeliacs.<ref name="pmid17544966">{{cite journal |author=Mamone G, Ferranti P, Rossi M, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of a peptide from alpha-gliadin resistant to digestive enzymes: implications for celiac disease |journal=J.

====Intraepithileal lymphocytes and IL15====
The release of IL15 is a major factor in coeliac disease as IL15 has been found to attract '''intraepithelial [[lymphocytes]]''' (IEL) that characterize Marsh grade 1 and 2 coeliac disease.<ref name="pmid11197245">{{cite journal |author=Maiuri L, Ciacci C, Vacca L, ''et al.'' |title=IL-15 drives the specific migration of CD94+ and TCR-gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes in organ cultures of treated celiac patients |journal=Am.

One hypothesis is that IL-15 induces the highly inflammatory Th1 response that activates T-helper cells (DQ2 restricted gliadin specific) that then orchestrate the destructive response, but the reason why inflammatory cells develop prior to gliadin specific helper cells is not known.<ref name="pmid15829281">{{cite journal |author=Londei M, Ciacci C, Ricciardelli I, Vacca L, Quaratino S, Maiuri L |title=Gliadin as a stimulator of innate responses in celiac disease |journal=Mol.

In addition, other [[cytokines]] such as [[Interleukin 12|IL12]] and [[IL2]], which are typically associated with T-helper cell stimulation, are not involved. In these two ways the innate peptide activation of T-cells in celiac disease is strange. IL-15 appears to induce increases in [[MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A|MICA]] and [[NKG2D]] that may increase brush-border cell killing.<ref name="pmid16766754"/>

In addition, innate immunity to IRP peptide is involved in [[coeliac disease]], [[dermatitis herpetiformis]] and possibly [[juvenile diabetes]]. IRP targets [[monocyte]]s and increases the production of IL-15 by an HLA-DQ ''independent'' pathway, a subsequent study showed that both this region and the "33mer" could create the same response, in cells from both treated coeliacs and non-coeliacs. However, unlike the non-coeliacs, the treated coeliac cells produce the disease marker ''[[nitrite]]''.<ref name="pmid17519496">{{cite journal | author = Bernardo D, Garrote JA, Fernández-Salazar L, Riestra S, Arranz E | title = Is gliadin really safe for non-coeliac individuals?

After extensive study, there is no known genetic association for this that appears to stand out at present, and implicates other environmental factors in the defect.

===Infiltrating peptides===
Some alpha gliadin have other ''direct-acting'' properties. Other gliadin peptides, one in a glutamine rich region and another peptide, "QVLQQSTYQLLQELCCQHLW",  bind a chemoattractant receptor, [http://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?hgnc_id=4540 CXCR3]. Gliadin binds to, blocks and displaces a factor, [[I-TAC]], that binds this receptor.<ref name="pmid18485912"/> In the process it recruits more CXCR3 receptor, increases [[MyD88]] and [[Zonulin]] expression.<ref name="pmid16766754"/><ref name="pmid16456012">{{cite journal |author=Thomas KE, Sapone A, Fasano A, Vogel SN |title=Gliadin stimulation of murine macrophage inflammatory gene expression and intestinal permeability are MyD88-dependent: role of the innate immune response in Celiac disease |journal=J.

==HLA Class I restrictions to gliadin==
HLA class I restrictions to gliadin are not well characterized. [[HLA-A2]] presentation has been investigated.
The HLA-A antigens can mediate [[apoptosis]] in autoimmune disease and HLA A*0201 in with the [[HLA-DQ8]] haplotypes has been documented.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gianfrani C, Troncone R, Mugione P, Cosentini E, De Pascale M, Faruolo C, Senger S, Terrazzano G, Southwood S, Auricchio S, Sette A |title=Celiac disease association with CD8+ T cell responses: identification of a novel gliadin-derived HLA-A2-restricted epitope |journal=J Immunol |volume=170 |issue=5 |pages=2719–26 |year=2003 |pmid=12594302}}</ref> The class I sites were found on the carboxyl end of gliadin at positions 123-131, 144-152, and 172-180. The involvement of class I responses may be minor, since antibodies to transglutaminase correlate with pathogenesis and recognition of extracellular matrix and cell surface transglutaminase can explain the destruction within coeliac disease. This process involves [[antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity]]. With regard to a receptor called FOS, euphemistically called the "Death Receptor", enterocytes appear to overexpress the receptor in coeliac lesions, there is speculation that Class I presentation of glaidin, tTG or other peptides that invokes signalling. The role of class I receptor in cell-mediated programmed cell (enterocyte) death is not known.

===MIC===
These proteins are called MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A and B. Discovered by sequence homology analysis these proteins are found on the surface of enterocytes of the small intestine, are believed to play a role in disease. Studies to date have revealed no mutation that would increase risk for MICA.

| '''DQ haplotypes'''
|-
| [[Image:HLA-DQ locus.png|thumb|right|Illustration of DQ antigen genetics, click image for details]] Each individual has 22 pairs of [[autosomes]]. The HLA complex in humans is a large region, ~3 million [[nucleotide]]s, on [[chromosome 6]], within this region there are a large number of [[wikt:gene|gene]]s. The DQ represent 2 genetic [[wikt:locus|loci]] that lie next to each other. One gene is called DQA1 and the other is called DQB1. There are many  [[wikt:allele|alleles]] at each genetic locus. {{further2|[[HLA-DQ]], [[HLA-DQA1]], [[HLA-DQB1]]}}

DQ antigen, a cell surface receptor, is composed of two [[wikt:polypeptide|polypeptide]] [[wikt:subunit|subunits]]. There are dozens of [[wikt:allele|alleles]] at each locus and many create [[wikt:unique|unique]] subunit [[wikt:isoform|isoforms]]. There are a large number of possible combinations. Evolution of humans has limited the most common isoforms. These are more common isoforms encoded by [[wikt:haplotype|haplotypes]], almost all of the time, one passed without change from a persons mother and father from conception. Each allele at each locus has an official name. For the alpha subunit the names are given by the gene-alleles. For example the major DQ'''1''' alleles are given as DQA1*'''01'''01, *'''01'''02, *'''01'''03, *'''01'''04. DQ1 refers to the DQ α1 groups of isoforms (historically by serotype) which is the '''01''' portion of the allele number, the last two digits identify a specific allele in that group. All other DQ serotypes refer to beta chain groups - DQ2, DQ3-(DQ7, DQ8, DQ9), DQ4, DQ5, DQ6.  A common way to write a phenotype (both alleles a person has) as DQA1*0101/*0102. This is not enough information to identify a persons isoforms. We also need information about beta chain, the best way to do this is to refer to common haplotypes.   HLA-DQ haplotypes are commonly written in a style: HLA-DQA1*0101:DQB1*0501. When considering a persons haplo-phenotype the form DQA1*0102:DQB1*0602/DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 is the same as DQA1*0102/*0501 DQB1*0602/*0201. When drawn out the form can be used to identify all potential isoforms. (See image below)
|-
| [[Image:HLA-DQ protein.PNG|thumb|left|Relationship of haplotypes to antigens]] There are many potential DQ isoforms as a result of [[wikt:cis|cis]]- and [[wikt:trans|trans]]-haplotype pairing (see image on left). Of course the cis-haplotypes are more common.  Typically most individuals can produce 4 isoforms, but the 2 isoforms tend to be the most abundant. There are instances where this may not be true, such as when the two betas or two alphas are very similar in structure. Most important with regard to isoforms - ''different subunit isoform pairings can result in the binding of different foreign or self antigens''. From a disease defense perspective the more different kinds of peptides that can be presented, the more likely the immune system will detect pathogens and remove them quickly. As a consequence the HLA genes are kept extremely variable in most mammalian populations relative to other genes.
|-
| '''DQ2.5 and gluten sensitivity'''</br>
[[Image:HLA-DQ2.5-2.5 protein.png|thumb|right|Isoform pairings in DQ2.5 homozygotes result in one isoform]] 
For [[coeliac disease]] however there appears to be one isoform that has a higher role. This isoform is DQ α5-β2 (DQ2.5). Because the beta chain is β2, historically it has been called DQ2. Not all DQ2 isoforms are pathogenic, but at least 2 appear to be more associated with disease. DQ2.5 isoform is not rare, 25% of Americans Caucasians carry the isoform, whereas >90% of people with coeliac disease carry the isoform.  DQ2 is also increased in gluten-sensitive idiopathic neuropathy. The  DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 haplotype is the most frequent source of DQ2.5 isoform called DQ2.5<sub>cis</sub>. It is found in almost all celiacs and the haplotype is frequently called, also, DQ2.5 haplotype.

25% of celiacs are DQ2 [[wikt:homozygote|homozygotes]] (HLA DQB1*02 homozygotes), only a small percent of these do not bear DQ2.5<sub>cis</sub>.<ref name="pmid15014431">{{cite journal |author=van Belzen MJ, Koeleman BP, Crusius JB, ''et al.'' |title=Defining the contribution of the HLA region to cis DQ2-positive coeliac disease patients |journal=Genes Immun. |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=215–20 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15014431 |doi=10.1038/sj.gene.6364061 |url=}}</ref> This minority are invariably DQA1*0201:DQB1*0202 (DQ2.2<sub>cis</sub> homozygotes).<ref name="pmid12651074">{{cite journal |author=Karell K, Louka AS, Moodie SJ, ''et al.'' |title=HLA types in celiac disease patients not carrying the DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DQ2) heterodimer: results from the European Genetics Cluster on Celiac Disease |journal=Hum.

These ''DQ2 homozygotes'' tend to show increased mucosa damage and degradation and are at greatest risk for severe complications of coeliac disease, refractory disease, and enteritis associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). {{further2|[[DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5]], [[DQ2#DQ2.2|DQ2.2]], [[HLA-DQ2#Coeliac_disease_associations|DQ2 and coeliac disease]], [[HLA DR3-DQ2]]}}
</br></br>
Risk for disease tends to be carried in families because of the DQ2.5<sub>cis</sub> encoding haplotypes. Atypically about 3% of coeliacs get DQ2.5 isoform as a result of trans-chromosomal encoding. This can occur because one DQ haplotype, DQA1*0505:DQB1*0301 (DQ7.5) produces an alpha chain in which the variable portion relative to DQA1*0501 is chopped off during processing to DQ heterodymer.[[Image:HLA-DQ2.5trans protein.png|thumb|right|Isoform pairings in DQ7.5/DQ2.2 result in 4 proteins isoforms, DQ2.5trans isoform is one(circled)]] Therefore it can produce the α5 subunit. The DQ2.2 haplotypes provide the β2 subunit, and consequently DQ7.5/DQ2.2 phenotype creates the DQ2.5<sub>trans</sub> isoform.</br></br>
The DQ isoform has a complex genetic involvement in coeliac disease. And these involvements explain the majority of disease. One other haplotype exists that is associated with disease, although not as common in Europe, DQ8 is found to be involved in coeliac disease in peoples where DQ2 is not present. DQ8.1 haplotype encodes the DQA1*0301:DQB1*0302 haplotype and represents the overwhelming majority of all DQ8. DQ2.5 is generally highest in northern, islandic Europe, and the Basque of Northern Spain. Phenotype frequency exceeds 50% in certain parts of Ireland. DQ8 is extremely high in Native Americans of Central America and tribes of Eastern American origin, fortunately most of these peoples have retained a maize based diet.

[[HLA-DQ]] proteins present polypeptide regions of proteins of about 9 amino acids and larger in size (10 to 14 residues in involved in binding is common for gliadin) to T lymphocytes.<ref name="pmid8753854">{{cite journal |author=van de Wal Y, Kooy YM, Drijfhout JW, Amons R, Koning F |title=Peptide binding characteristics of the coeliac disease-associated DQ(alpha1*0501, beta1*0201) molecule |journal=Immunogenetics |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=246–53 |year=1996 |pmid=8753854 |doi= 10.1007/BF02602553|url=}}</ref> 
Gliadin proteins can be adsorbed by [[antigen presenting cells|APC]]. After digestion in the [[lysozome]]s of APCs, glaidin peptides can be recycled to the cell's surface bound to DQ, or they can be bound and presented directly from the cell surface.<ref name="pmid16766754">{{cite journal | author = Qiao SW, Bergseng E, Molberg O, Xia J, Fleckenstein B, Khosla C, and Sollid LM. | title= Antigen presentation to celiac lesion-derived T cells of a 33-mer gliadin peptide naturally formed by gastrointestinal digestion. | journal = J Immunol. | volume = 173 | issue = 3 | pages = 1756–1762 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15265905}}</ref> The major source of inflammatory gluten is dietary gluten. Optimal reactivity of gliadin occurs when the protein is partially digested by small intestinal [[lysozyme]] and [[trypsin]] into proteolytic digests. These polypeptides of gluten can then make their way behind the epithelial layer of cells (membrane), where APCs and T-cells reside in the [[lamina propria]]. (See: '''Underlying conditions''')  

The APC bearing DQ-gliadin peptide on the surface can bind to T-cells that have an ''antibody-like'' T-cell receptor the specifically recognized DQ2.5 with gliadin. The complex (APC-DQ-glaidin) thus stimulates the gliadin specific T-cells to divide. These cells cause [[B-cell]]s that recognize gliadin to [[wikt:proliferate|proliferate]]. The B-cells mature into [[plasma cell]]s producing [[anti-gliadin antibodies]]. This does not cause coeliac disease and is an unknown factor in [[Gluten sensitivity#Idiopathic gluten sensitivity|idiopathic disease]]. [[wikt:enteropathy|Enteropathy]] is believed to occur when [[tissue transglutaminase]](tTG) [[wikt:covelant|covelantly]] links itself to [[gliadin]] [[peptide]]s that enter the [[lamina propria]] of the intestinal [[wikt:villi|villus]]. The resulting structure can be presented by APC (with the same gliadin recognizing DQ isoforms) to T-cells, and B-cells can produce [[anti-transglutaminase antibodies]]. This appears to result in the destruction of the villi. The release of gliadin by transglutaminase does not lessen disease. When tTG-gliadin undergoes [[wikt:hydrolysis|hydrolysis]] (steals a water to cut the two apart), the result is deamidated gliadin. [[wikt:deamidation|Deamidated]] gliadin peptides are more inflammatory relative to natural peptides. Deamidated gliadin is also found in foods that have added gluten, such as wheat bread, food pastes.

The major gluten proteins that are involved in coeliac disease are the α-gliadin isoforms. Alpha gliadin is composed of repeated [[wikt:motif|motifs]] that, when digested, can be presented by HLA-DQ molecules.

===HLA-DQ2.5===
HLA-DQ recognition of gliadin is critical to the pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, it also appears to be involved in idiopathic gluten sensitivity (See:'''Understanding DQ Haplotypes and DQ isoforms''' on the right).
[[HLA-DQ2]] primarily presents gliadins with the HLA-DQ isoform [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5]] (DQ α5-β2) isoform. DQA1*0202:DQB1*0201 homozygotes (DQ α2-β2) also appear to be able to present pathogenic gliadin peptides, but a smaller set with lower binding affinity.</br></br>

====DQ2.5 and α-gliadin====
Many of these gliadin motifs are substrates for [[tissue transglutaminase]] and therefore can be modified by [[wikt:deamidation|deamidation]] in the gut to create more inflammatory peptides. The most important recognition appears to be directed toward the α-/β-[[gliadin]]s. An example of the repetition of a motif across many proteins, the α-2 gliadin (57-68) and (62-75) are also found on α-4, α-9 gliadin.<ref name="Gli_Motif">{{cite journal | author = Vader L, Stepniak D, Bunnik E, Kooy Y, de Haan W, Drijfhout J, Van Veelen P, Koning F | title = Characterization of cereal toxicity for celiac disease patients based on protein homology in grains. | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 125 | issue = 4 | pages = 1105–13 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14517794 | doi = 10.1016/S0016-5085(03)01204-6}}</ref> Many gliadins contain the "α-20 motif", which is found in wheat and other ''Triticeae'' genera.(see also: [[Talk:Gluten_sensitivity#Alpha_gliadin_.22.CE.B1-20.22_motifs|"α-20" gliadin motifs]]).

====DQ2.5 and γ-gliadin====
While gamma glaidin is not as important to DQ2.5 mediated disease as α-2 gliadin there are a number of identified motifs.

====DQ2 and glutelins====
Triticeae glutelins presented by DQ2 is some coeliacs. In wheat, the low molecular weight glutenins often share structural similarity with the prolamins of the similar species of Triticeae. Two motifs, K1-like (46-60), pGH3-like (41-59) and GF1(33-51) have been identified. High molecular weight glutenin has also been identified as a potentially toxic protein<ref name="HMWglt_Toxic">{{cite journal | author = Dewar D, Amato M, Ellis H, Pollock E, Gonzalez-Cinca N, Wieser H, Ciclitira P | title = The toxicity of high molecular weight glutenin subunits of wheat to patients with coeliac disease. | journal = Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 483–91 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16607142 | doi = 10.1097/00042737-200605000-00005}}</ref> Some of the HMW glutenins increase response with transglutaminase treatment, indicating the sites might be similar to alpha-gliadin and gamma gliadin T-cell sites.<ref name="pmid12891534">{{cite journal |author=Molberg Ø, Solheim Flaete N, Jensen T, ''et al.'' |title=Intestinal T-cell responses to high-molecular-weight glutenins in celiac disease |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=337–44 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12891534 |doi= 10.1016/S0016-5085(03)00890-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508503008904}}</ref>

===DQ2.2 restricted gliadin sites===
DQ2.2 can present a fewer number of lower affinity sites relative to DQ2.5.  Some of these sites are found on γ-gliadin the gliadin most similar to [[prolamin]]s of other [[Triticeae]] [[wikt:genera|genera]], a gliadin that appears to similar to ancestral. Antigen presenting cells bearing DQ2.2 can present alpha gliadin sites, for example alpha-II region of the "33mer" and therefore the "33mer" may have a role in DQ2.2 bearing individuals, but the binding capacity is substantially lower.<ref name="pmid15972656"/>

===HLA-DQ8===
[[HLA-DQ8]] confers susceptibility to coeliac disease but in a fashion somewhat similar to DQ2.5.<ref>HLA-DQ8 generally refers to DQ8.1, DQA1*0301:DQB1*0302 but DQA1*0301 and DQA1*0303 can produce the same functional isoform, rarely DQA1*0503 is in the DQ8 haplotype, it has no known association with disease</ref> Homozygotes of DQ8, DQ2.5/DQ8 and DQ8/DQ2.2 are higher than expected based on levels in the general population.(see: '''Understanding DQ haplotypes and DQ isoforms''').<ref name="pmid12651074"/> HLA-DQ8 is generally not as involved in the most severe complications, and it does not recognize the "33mer" of α-2 gliadin to the same degree as DQ2.5. There are a smaller number of gliadin (prolamin) peptides presented by HLA-DQ8. A few studies have been done on the adaptive immune response for DQ8/DQ2- individuals. DQ8 appears to rely much more on adaptive immunity to the carboxyl half of alpha gliadins.<ref>positions (~230-240) and (>241-<255) of alpha gliadin [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&val=7209264 AJ133612]</ref>  In addition, it appear to react with gamma gliadin to a degree comparable to DQ2.5.<ref>For γ-gliadins, γ-M369999 gliadin, reaction occurs at multiple sites (position: (~16-24), (>41-<60), (~79-90), (~94-102), (>101-<120))</ref> T-cell responses to the high molecular weight glutenin may be more important with DQ8 mediated than DQ2.5 mediated celiac disease.<ref name="HMWglt_Toxic"/>

==Antibody recognition==
Antibody recognition of gluten is complex. Direct binding to gluten such as [[anti-gliadin antibodies]] has an ambiguous pathogenesis in coeliac disease. The crosslinking of gliadin with tissue transglutaminase leads to the production of [[anti-transglutaminase antibodies]], but this is mediated through T-cell recognition of gliadin. The [[wheat allergy|allergic recognition of gliadin]] by mast cells, eosinophiles in the presence of IgE has notable direct consequences, such as [[exercise-induced anaphylaxis]].

Anti-gliadin antibodies, like those detected in celiac disease bind to the α-2 gliadin(57-73).<ref name="IgA_GliPeptides">{{cite journal | author = Bateman EA, Ferry BL, Hall A, Misbah SA, Anderson R, and Kelleher P. | title =  IgA antibodies of coeliac disease patients recognise a dominant T cell epitope of A-gliadin. | journal = Gut. | volume = 53 | issue = 9 | pages = 1274–1278  | year = 2004 | pmid = 15306584 | doi =  10.1136/gut.2003.032755 | pmc = 1774203}}</ref>

==Taming Triticeae Immunochemistry==
New immunogenic motifs appear in the literature almost monthly and new gliadin and ''Triticeae'' protein sequences appear that contain these motifs. The HLA DQ2.5 restricted peptide "I I Q P Q Q P A Q" produced approximately 50 hits of identical sequences in NCBI-Blast search is one of a several dozen known motifs<ref name="Gli_Motif"/> whereas only a small fraction of Triticeae gluten variants have been examined. For this reason the immunochemistry is best discussed at the level of ''Triticeae'', because it is clear that the special immunological properties of the proteins appear to have basal affinities to this taxa, appearing concentrated in wheat as a result of its three various genomes. Some current studies claim that removing the toxicity of gliadins from wheat as plausible,<ref name="Gli_nontoxic">{{cite journal | author = Benahmed M, Mention J, Matysiak-Budnik T, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: a future without gluten-free diet?? | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 125 | issue = 4 | pages = 1264–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14517809 | doi = 10.1016/j.gastro.2003.07.002}}</ref> but, as the above illustrates, the problem is monumental. There are many gluten proteins, 3 genomes with many genes each for alpha, gamma, and omega gliadins. For each motif many genome-loci are present, and there are many motifs, some still not known. Different strains of triticeae exist for different industrial applications; durum for pasta and food pastes, 2 types of barley for beer, bread wheats used in different areas with different growing conditions. Replacing these motifs is not a plausible task since a contamination of 0.02% wheat in a GF diet is considered to be pathogenic and would require replacing motifs in all known regional varieties, potentially thousands of genetic modifications.<ref name="Gli_nontoxic"/>  Class I and Antibody responses are downstream of Class II recognition and are of little remedial value in change. The innate response peptide could be a silver bullet, assuming there is only one of these per protein and only a few genome loci with the protein. The bigger question is why late onset gluten sensitivity rapidly rising, is this truly a wheat problem or is it something that being done to wheat, or to those who are eating wheat (for example communicable diseases as trigger)? Some individuals are susceptible by genetics (early onset), but many late onset cases could have variable triggers because there is nothing genetically that separates the 30 to 40% of people that could have ''Triticeae'' sensitivity from the ~1% that, in their lifetime, will have some level of this disease. Another strategy in making wheat less immunogenic is to insert proteolytic sites in the longer motifs (25-mer and 33-mer) facilitating more complete digestion.
