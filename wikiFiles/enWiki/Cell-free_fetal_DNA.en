'''Cell-free fetal DNA''' (cffDNA) was discovered in 1997 by Lo et al. circulating freely in the maternal blood stream. Its discovery is revolutionizing prenatal medicine.  Studies have looked at, and some even optimized, protocols for testing non-compatible [[RhD]] factors, sex determination for [[X-linked genetic disorder]]s and testing for single gene disorders.<ref name=HahnChitty2008>Hahn, S.; Chitty, L.

''Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD)''
NIPD is the use of a simple blood test and subsequent and extraction and analysis of the fetal DNA to determine the health status of the fetus.<ref name=HillBarrett2012>Hill, M.; Barrett, A. N.; White, H.; Chitty, L. S. (2012). "Uses of cell free fetal DNA in maternal circulation". ''Best Practice & Research: Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology'' '''26''' (5): 639-654.</ref> Current NIPD protocols are looking for RhD factor incompatibility, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders, genetic mutations causing monogenic diseases, and detecting aneuploidies in the developing fetus.<ref name=HahnChitty2008/><ref name=FanBlumenfeld2008/><ref name=Lo2007/> The idea of NIPD is to eventually optimize the protocol so that it will replace the currently used methods (CVS & Amniocentesis).

==Chorionic villi sampling (CVS)==
CVS is a current method of prenatal diagnosis which can be performed as early as 9 weeks of gestation.  Chorionic villi are part of the placenta; they sprout off of the chorion and invade the uterine wall.<ref name=YoungEcker2013>Young, B. C.; Ecker, J. L. (2013). "Fetal macrosomia and shoulder dystocia in women with gestational diabetes: risks amenable to treatment?" ''Current Diabetes Reports'' '''13''' (1): 12-18.</ref><ref name=WapnerJackson1988>Wapner, R. J.; Jackson, L. (1988). "Chorionic villus sampling". ''Clinical obstetrics and gynecology'' '''31''' (2): 328-344.</ref> In most cases the chorionic villi share the same genetic makeup as the fetus which is why is it used in prenatal testing.<ref name=WapnerJackson1988/> The method involves the use of an ultrasound to guide the needle. Needle aspiration can be done through the cervix or transabdominal. A sample of the chorionic villi is taken, and the tissue is analyzed.<ref name=YoungEcker2013/> The procedure does pose some risks to the pregnancy; an estimate of 1 in 100 pregnancies results in miscarriage due to the procedure.<ref name=WapnerJackson1988/><ref name=MujezinovicAlfirevic2007>Mujezinovic, F.; Alfirevic, Z. (2007). "Procedure-related complications of amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling: a systematic review". ''Obstetrics and Gynecology'' '''110''' (3): 687-694.</ref>

==Amniocentesis==
An amniocentesis is done as early as 15 weeks gestation. The procedure involves removing a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus.<ref name=YoungEcker2013/> This is the fluid that the baby has been living in, thus the cells in this fluid will match the baby’s genetic makeup. An amniocentesis is done by needle aspiration through the abdomen, with an ultrasound to guide the needle. The sample of amniotic fluid is then analyzed from any chromosomal abnormalities of genetic disorders.<ref name=YoungEcker2013/> This invasive procedure also has risk; about 1 in every 200 pregnancies will result in miscarriage due to the procedure.<ref name=Lo2008>Lo, Y. M. (2008). "Fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''1137''': 140-143.</ref>

It is because of these risks that NIPD is needed. A simple blood test to determine the health of the fetus is non-invasive and proposes no risk to the mother or fetus’ health.<ref name=HillBarrett2012/>

==Cell free fetal DNA==

[[File:Cell free fetal DNA shedding into maternal bloodstream.pdf|thumb|Cell free fetal DNA shedding into maternal bloodstream]]
cffDNA is the free, fragmented DNA that is fetal in origin that is present in the maternal bloodstream. This DNA originates from the trophoblasts making up the placenta.<ref name=Alberry2007>Alberry, M., et al. (2007).

"Detection of paternally inherited fetal point mutations for beta-thalassemia using size-fractionated cell-free DNA in maternal plasma". ''The Journal of the American Medical Association'' '''293''' (7): 843-849.</ref>

==Methods: From Extraction to Diagnosis==
The general procedure is that a sample of the woman’s blood is taken after 10 weeks of pregnancy but can be detected as early as the fifth week.<ref name=Guibert2003>Guibert, J., et al. (2003). "Kinetics of SRY gene appearance in maternal serum: detection by real time PCR in early pregnancy after assisted reproductive technique". ''Human Reproduction'' '''18''' (8): 1733-1736.</ref> The test measures the relative amount of free fetal DNA in the mother’s blood which consists of approximately 2-6% of the total.<ref name=LoLo1998/>
  
Limitations include the concentration of all cell-free DNA in maternal blood is low, the total amount of cell-free DNA varies between individuals, cell free fetal DNA molecules are out-numbered by maternal cell-free DNA molecules, the fetus inherits half the genome from the mother. However, there are ways around these limitations.<ref name=WrightBurton2009>Wright, C. F.; Burton, H. (2009). "The use of cell-free fetal nucleic acids in maternal blood for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis". ''Human Reproduction Update'' '''15''' (1): 139-151.</ref>

===Cell-free DNA purification===
Protocols for isolation of plasma from maternal blood include centrifugation, followed by isolation and purification of cell-free DNA.<ref name=Chiu2001>Chiu, R. W., et al. (2001). "Effects of blood-processing protocols on fetal and total DNA quantification in maternal plasma". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''47''' (9): 1607-1613.</ref> A standardized protocol by Legler et al. was created in 2007 from evaluation of previous primary literature. The highest yield for extraction of cell-free DNA was obtained with QIAamp DSP Virus Kit.<ref name=Legler2007>Legler, T. J., et al. (2007). "Workshop report on the extraction of foetal DNA from maternal plasma". ''Prenatal Diagnosis'' '''27''' (9): 824-829.</ref> 

Addition of formaldehyde to maternal blood samples increases the percentage of free fetal DNA. The purpose of formaldehyde is to stabilize intact cells, and inhibit further release of maternal DNA. The mean percentage of free fetal DNA in maternal bood ranges from 0.32% to 40%, with a mean percentage of 7.7<ref name=Dhallan2004>Dhallan, R., et al. (2004). "Methods to increase the percentage of free fetal DNA recovered from the maternal circulation". ''The Journal of the American Medical Association'' '''291''' (9): 1114-1119.</ref> without formaldehyde-treatment. The mean percentage of free fetal DNA with formaldehyde treatment was 20.2%. However, Benachi et al. in 2005 and Chinnapapagari et al. 2005 have highlighted the range of results from 5% to 96%.<ref name=Benachi2005>Benachi, A., et al. (2005). "Impact of formaldehyde on the in vitro proportion of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and serum". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''51''' (1): 242-244.</ref><ref name=ChinnapapagariHolzgreve2005>Chinnapapagari, S. K.; Holzgreve, W.; Lapaire, O.; Zimmermann, B.; Hahn, S. (2005). "Treatment of maternal blood samples with formaldehyde does not alter the proportion of circulatory fetal nucleic acids (DNA and mRNA) in maternal plasma". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''51''' (3): 652-655.</ref> Another way to increase the fetal DNA is based on physical length of DNA fragments. Fetal DNA is smaller in size, a standardized size fractionation can be<ref name=Li2004/> and can comprise up to 70% of total cell-free DNA.

===Specification of fetal DNA and mutation detection===

To detect fetal DNA, majority of studies focus on detecting paternally inherited sequences.<ref name=Traeger-Synodinos2006>Traeger-Synodinos, J. (2006). "Real-time PCR for prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis of monogenic diseases". ''Molecular Aspects of Medicine'' '''27''' (2-3): 176-191.</ref><ref name=Al-Yatama2001>Al-Yatama, M. K., et al. (2001). "Detection of Y chromosome-specific DNA in the plasma and urine of pregnant women using nested polymerase chain reaction". ''Prenatal Diagnosis'' '''21''' (5): 399-402.</ref><ref name=Boon2007>Boon, E. M., et al. (2007). "Y chromosome detection by Real Time PCR and pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerisation using free fetal DNA isolated from maternal plasma". ''Prenatal Diagnosis'' '''27''' (10): 932-937.</ref> For example, primers can be designed to target the Y chromosome of male fetuses for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A variety of methods have been used for mutation detection in fetal DNA.

====Real-time quantitative PCR====
Fluorescent probes are used to monitor the accumulation of amplicons produced throughout the PCR process. Thus, increase in reporter fluorescent signal is proportional to the number of amplicons generated. The appropriate real-time PCT protocol is designed according to the mutation or genotype to be detected. Point mutations are analysed with qualitative real-time PCR with the use of allele-specific probes. Insertions and deletions are analyzed by dosage measurements using quantitative real-time PCR.

Performance of RT-qPCR was examined by Hill and colleagues in 2010.<ref name=Hill2010>Hill, M., et al. (2010). "Steroid metabolome in fetal and maternal body fluids in human late pregnancy". ''The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'' '''122''' (4): 114-132.</ref> They analyzed SRY or DYS14 gene in cffDNA in 511 pregnancies. There was a high concordance rate of 401/403 for pregnancies at 7 weeks gestation or greater. Real-time PCR assays for single cell analysis have been developed for a Y-chromosome marker;<ref name=PierceRice2000>Pierce, K. E.; Rice, J. E.; Sanchez, J. A.; Brenner, C.; Wangh, L. J. (2000).

"Real-time PCR for single-cell genotyping in sickle cell and thalassemia syndromes as a rapid, accurate, reliable, and widely applicable protocol for preimplantation genetic diagnosis". ''Human Mutation'' '''23''' (5): 513-521.</ref>

====Nested PCR====
Al-Yatama et al 2010 evaluated the use of nested PCR to detect the Y chromosome in fetal DNA of maternal plasma. They detected 53/55 male fetuses. 3/25 women with female fetuses had a Y chromosome-specific signal. Thus, the results show 96% sensitivity and 88% specificity.<ref name=Al-Yatama2001/>

====Digital PCR====
Microfluidic devices have the ability to perform highly parallel analysis in a single PCR step.<ref name=Zimmermann2008>Zimmermann, B. G., et al. (2008). "Digital PCR: a powerful new tool for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis?". ''Prenatal Diagnosis'' '''28''' (12): 1087-1093.</ref> Absolute quantification can be achieves rather than relative quantification compared to RT-PCR. Thus, point mutations, copy number variations, loss of heterozygosity or aneuploidy can be detected.<ref name=Lo2007/><ref name=Quake2007>Quake, S. (2007). "At the interface of physics and biology". ''BioTechniques'' '''43''' (1): 19.</ref> Digital PCR can differentiate between maternal blood plasma and fetal DNA in a multiplex fashion.<ref name=Zimmermann2008/>

====Shotgun sequencing====
High-throughput shotgun sequencing technology from plasma of pregnant women, obtaining about 5 million sequence tags per patient sample can be done. Fan et al 2008, using this method, was able to identify aneuploid pregnancies; trisomy detected at gestational ages as early as 14th week. Shot-gun sequencing can be done with a Solexa/Illumina platform. Whole fetal genome mapping by parental haplotype analysis using sequencing of cell free fetal DNA was done in 2010.<ref name=Lo2008/> Chiu et al in 2010 studied 753 pregnant females, using a 2-plex massively parallel maternal plasma DNA sequencing and trisomy was diagnosed with z-score greater than 3.<ref name=ChiuLo2010>Chiu, R. W.; Lo, Y. M. (2010). "Pregnancy-associated microRNAs in maternal plasma: a channel for fetal-maternal communication?". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''56''' (11): 1656-1657.</ref> The test was 100% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity, positive predictive value of 96.6%, and negative predictive value of 100%.

====Mass spectrometry====
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) combined with base extension after PCR allows cell free fetal  DNA detection with single base specificity and single DNA molecule sensitivity.<ref name=Ding2008>Ding, C. (2008). "Maldi-TOF mass spectrometry for analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma". ''Methods in Molecular Biology'' '''444''': 253-267.</ref> DNA is first amplified by PCR, then linear amplification with base extension reaction (with a third primer) is designed to anneal to the region upstream of the mutation site. Either 1-2 bases are added to the extension primer to produce two extension products from wild-type DNA and mutant DNA. Since single base specificity is achieved, it is better than hybridization-based techniques with Taqman probes. According to Ding et al, no false negatives were found and no false positives were detected when looking for fetal DNA across 16 individuals.<ref name=Ding2008/> A study by Akolekar and colleagues in 2010 genders of 90/91 males babies were confirmed, MALDI-TOF mass spectometry had a 99.1% accuracy with 98.9% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity.<ref name=AkolekarFarkas2010>Akolekar, R.; Farkas, D. H.; VanAgtmael, A. L.; Bombard, A. T.; Nicolaides, K. H. (2010). "Fetal sex determination using circulating cell-free fetal DNA (ccffDNA) at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation". ''Prenatal Diagnosis'' '''30''' (10): 918-923.</ref>

====Epigenetic modifications====
Differences in gene activation between maternal DNA and fetal DNA can be exploited. Most current research is focussed on using epigenetic modifications to detect cffDNA.<ref name=TongChiu2012>Tong, Y. K.; Chiu, R. W.; Chan, K. C.; Leung, T. Y.; Lo, Y. M. (2012).

"Fetal-specific DNA methylation ratio permits noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21". ''Nature Medicine'' '''17''' (4): 510-513.</ref> Hypermethylated RASSF1A promoter has been reported as universal fetal marker to confirm the presence of cffDNA.<ref name=WhiteDent2012>White, H. E., Dent, C. L.; Hall, V. J.; Crolla, J. A.; Chitty, L. S. (2012). "Evaluation of a novel assay for detection of the fetal marker RASSF1A: facilitating improved diagnostic reliability of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis". ''PloS One'' '''7''' (9): e45073.</ref> A new method was proposed by White et al (2012). cffDNA was extracted from the maternal plasma, digested with methylation-sensitive and insensitive restriction enzymes and RT-PCR analysis of RASSF1A, SRY, DYS14 was done.<ref name=WhiteDent2012/> 79/90 (88%) of maternal blood samples were detected for hypermethylated RASSF1A.

====Detection of mRNA derived from genes====
mRNA transcripts from genes expressed in the placenta is detectable in maternal plasma.<ref name=Ng2002>Ng, E. K., et al. (2002). "Presence of filterable and nonfilterable mRNA in the plasma of cancer patients and healthy individuals". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''48''' (8): 1212-1217.</ref> The mixture of plasma is centrifuged and aqueous layer transferred, RNA is extracted. RT-PCR is set up for selected RNA expression. Specifically, hPL and beta-hCG mRNA is stable in maternal blood (Ng et al 2002). This can help to confirm the presence of fetal DNA in the maternal plasma.<ref name=WrightBurton2009/>

==Current use of cffdna==

===Early Identification of Fetal Sex===
The identification of fetal sex for women who are carriers of X-linked diseases is advantageous for the family. X-linked diseases occur 5 in 10,000 live births.<ref name=BairdAnderson1988>Baird, P. A.; Anderson, T. W.; Newcombe, H. B.; Lowry, R. B. (1988). "Genetic disorders in children and young adults: a population study". ''American Journal of Human Genetics'' '''42''' (5): 677-693.</ref> The most commonly published sex-linked diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia Ultrasonography is unreliable during the first trimester of pregnancy, the genitalia are not fully developed. Other methods for sex determination before the use of cffDNA are invasive and performed at 11 weeks of gestation. There is a small risk of miscarriage.<ref name=Scheffer2010>Scheffer, P. G., et al. (2010). "Reliability of fetal sex determination using maternal plasma".

"Optimized real-time quantitative PCR measurement of male fetal DNA in maternal plasma". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''51''' (9): 1598-1604.</ref>

Most X-linked diseases are evident in males because they lack the second X-chromosome that can compensate for the diseases allele. Some X-linked diseases include fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. In the case of X-linked diseases, if cffDNA can determine gender, invasive testing can be eliminated.<ref name=Bustamante-Aragones2010/> In congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the adrenal cortex lacks appropriate corticosteroid synthesis, leading to excess adrenal androgens and affects female fetuses.<ref name=FinningChitty2008>Finning, K. M.; Chitty, L. S. (2008). "Non-invasive fetal sex determination: impact on clinical practice". ''Seminars in Fetal & Neonatal Medicine'' '''13''' (2): 69-75.</ref> There is an external masculinization of the genitalia in the female fetuses.<ref name=MarkeyWadia2005>Markey, C. M.; Wadia, P. R.; Rubin, B. S.; Sonnenschein, C; Soto, A. M. (2005). "Long-term effects of fetal exposure to low doses of the xenoestrogen bisphenol-A in the female mouse genital tract". ''Biology of Reproduction'' '''72''' (6): 1344-1351.</ref> At the moment, at-risk mothers are given dexamethasone at 6 weeks of the pregnancy which suppresses the pituitary to release androgens. Invasive testing is used at 11 weeks of the pregnancy to determine the sex of the fetus. In Europe, tests for sex determination are available as early as 7 weeks of gestation; these tests cost $390.<ref name=SayresCho2011>Sayres, L. C.; Cho, M. K. (2011). "Cell-free fetal nucleic acid testing: a review of the technology and its applications". ''Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey'' '''66''' (7): 431-442.</ref> 
:Lack of the Y chromosome in the maternal plasma suggests that the fetus is female, but could also indicate failure to detect cffDNA in the maternal plasma. Thus, paternal polymorphisms or sex independent markers are further used to detect cffDNA. High heterozygosity of these markers must be detected for them to be application.<ref name=HillBarrett2012/>

===Genetic studies for families at high risk for inherited genetic disorders===
Severe monogenic diseases for which prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia.<ref name=Traeger-Synodinos2006/> Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders have been detected noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA.<ref name=Bustamante-Aragones2010/> Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant muation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences.<ref name=NorburyNorbury2008>Norbury, G.; Norbury, C. J. (2008). "Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of single gene disorders: how close are we?". ''Seminars in Fetal & Neonatal Medicine'' '''13''' (2): 76-83.</ref> cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations.<ref name=LiPage-Christiaens2007>Li, Y.; Page-Christiaens, G. C.; Gille, J. J.; Holzgreve, W.; Hahn, S. (2007). "Non-invasive prenatal detection of achondroplasia in size-fractionated cell-free DNA by MALDI-TOF MS assay". ''Prenatal Diagnosis'' '''27''' (1): 11-17.</ref> Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus was found to have the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation.<ref name=LiPage-Christiaens2007/> Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, Gonzalez et al 2003 was able to detect CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels. However, more research needs to be done on detection of triallelic repeats before the use of cffDNA in diagnostics of this disease.

===Routine prenatal screening for Rhesus factor and aneuploidy===
Mixing of fetal cells carrying paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood may result in the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is used to determine the risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mather and infant during birth, CVS, amniocentesis and accidents.<ref name=WrightBurton2009/> 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens are one of the most important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status.<ref name=Chinen2010>Chinen, P. A., et al. (2010).

In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus for these women (21, 48, 54).<ref name=WrightBurton2009/><ref name=FinningChitty2008/><ref name=KolialexiTounta2010>Kolialexi, A.; Tounta, G.; Mavrou, A.

Aneuploidy, which refers to abnormal number of chromosomes, can also be detected. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and trisomy 21,<ref name=Lo1999b>Lo, Y. M., et al. (1999). "Quantitative and temporal correlation between circulating cell-free Epstein-Barr virus DNA and tumor recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma".

Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers can also be used to detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing.

===Identification of Preeclampsia===
Preeclampsia refers to abnormal placental growth which can cause multiple problems including preterm labor, polyhydramnios, gravidarum, hyperemesis and fetal-maternal hemorrhage.<ref name=WrightBurton2009/> Preeclampsia is the most prevalent pregnancy complication and predominant cause of premature birth, occurring at 2-5% of pregnancies in first world countries and 10% in developing countries.<ref name=WrightBurton2009/> 

Lo et al in 1999 studied quantitative variations of cffDNA in maternal blood for preeclampsia.<ref name=Lo1999c>Lo, Y. M., et al. (1999). "Increased fetal DNA concentrations in the plasma of pregnant women carrying fetuses with trisomy 21". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''45''' (10): 1747-1751.</ref> cffDNA was measured by using PCR to the SRY gene. The levels were fivefold more in preeclampsia pregnancies than normal. This is consistent with subsequent studies.<ref name=LeungZhang2001>Leung, T. N.; Zhang, J.; Lau, T. K.; Chan, L. Y.; Lo, Y. M. (2001). "Increased maternal plasma fetal DNA concentrations in women who eventually develop preeclampsia". ''Clinical Chemistry'' '''47''' (1): 137-139.</ref><ref name=ZhongHolzgreve2002>Zhong, X. Y.; Holzgreve, W.; Hahn, S. (2002). "The levels of circulatory cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma are elevated prior to the onset of preeclampsia". ''Hypertension in Pregnancy: Official Journal of the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy'' '''21''' (1): 77-83.</ref> The largest study compared 120 women with preeclampsia pregnancies and 120 gestational age matched normal women. The cffDNA concentrations were 176 vs 75 genome equivalents/mL at 29 weeks of gestations. cffDNA concentration can be used as a screening tool.

===Ethical Issues with NIPD with cffDNA===
As technology for NIPD advances the most prominent ethical issue that is recurrently brought up is sex selection. Having the ability to accurately and safely determine the sex of the fetus as early as 4–5 weeks gestation will open up the ability for sex selective abortion in certain culture where having a male offspring is prefered.<ref name=HahnChitty2008/>

In Asian countries, particularly India and China, sex selection, in favour of male offspring, as been problem for many years.  Sex selection became noticeably out of control when demographic data was reporting 50 girls to every 100 boys in areas of both China and India.<ref name=George2006>George, S. M. (2006). "Sex ratio in India". ''Lancet'' '''367''' (9524): 1725; author reply 1727.</ref> In fact India banned prenatal sex determination in 1994 in order to control sex determination.<ref name=Jaising2004>Jaising, I.; Lawyers Collective Women's Rights Initiative (New Delhi India) (2004). ''Pre-Conception & Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act: A Users Guide to the Law''. Universal Law Publishing, Delhi. pp xii, 126.</ref> Although, in Western culture, sex determination is used in terms of risk for X-linked disorders; it is important to realize that in other countries this technology may not be used in the right way. Ethical boards and law will need to be put into place prior to NIPD use in countries in which sex determination is practiced.
