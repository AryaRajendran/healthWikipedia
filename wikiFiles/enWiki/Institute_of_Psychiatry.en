The '''Institute of Psychiatry''' (IOP) is a research institution dedicated to discovering what causes [[mental illness]] and diseases of the [[brain]]. In addition, its aim is to help identify new treatments for them and ways to prevent them in the first place. The IOP is a school of [[King's College London]], [[England]]. The Institute works closely with [[South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust]]. Many senior academic staff also work as honorary consultants for the Trust in clinical services such as the [[National Psychosis Unit]] at [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]].

==History==

The IOP shares a great deal of its history with the [[Maudsley Hospital]], with which it shares the location of its main building. Originally the "Maudsley Hospital Medical School", it changed its name to the ''Institute of Psychiatry'' in 1948 with [[Aubrey Lewis]] being appointed to the inaugural Chair of Psychiatry at the institute (which he held until his retirement in 1966). The main Institute building was opened in 1967 and contains lecture theatres, administrative offices, the library, and the "Cafe Diner" canteen. The [[Henry Wellcome]] building was opened in 2001 and houses most of the IOP's [[psychology]] department. In 2002 the Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Research Centre moved into a purpose-built building of their own. In 2004 a new Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences (CNS) was opened which provides offices, lab space, and access to two [[MRI]] scanners for neuroimaging research.

The Institute subscribes to a Statement of Common Purposes which states:
"The Institute of Psychiatry and the [[South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust]] work together to establish the best possible care for people who experience mental health problems. A key joint aim is promoting excellence in research, development and teaching in the sciences and disciplines key to the understanding and treatment of mental disorders and related disorders of the brain. This knowledge and the skills thus gained will be applied to prevention of these disorders, finding the most effective treatments and developing the best service models for the community."

==Departments==
===Academic Health Sciences Centre===
The UK’s largest [http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/departments/?locator=1064 Academic Health Sciences Centre] is being created that integrates world-leading research, teaching and clinical service to deliver improvements in care for both local people and patients from further afield.

===Biostatistics===
This department provides expert advice in the interpretation and use of statistical techniques in psychological research. All academic staff collaborate with researchers within the IOP as well as internationally. The Computing side of the department is responsible for the installation, maintenance, and upgrading of the IOP's [[Information Technology|IT]] infrastructure. This includes desktop and laptop PCs, SUN workstations, ethernet networks, wireless networks, as well as servers and data management. They work closely with members of the Neuroimaging section in their work using brain scanners.

The Biostatistics department opened in 1964, then as the Biometrics Unit by Professor A.E. Maxwell and now headed by Professor Andrew Pickles.  The department holds  particular expertise in multivariate statistical methods for measurement, life-course epidemiology and the analysis of experimental, genetic and neuropsychiatric data.  The department provides both introductory and advanced training in applied statistical methodology, collaborate on studies of mental health based here and internationally, and undertake research in relevant applied methodology.    In the area of Bioinformatics we have growing links to the NHS Specialist Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM/KCL). The Department of Biostatistics also hosts the UKCRN accredited King's Clinical Trials Unit which provides randomisation, data management, analysis and trial management - all of which are available to researchers across King's Health Partners. The CTU provides support to both medicinal and non-medicinal clinical trials assisting researchers in the conduct of carrying out clinical trials safely and to a high scientific standard, by offering a range of services to ensure results are accurate and credible.

===Child and Adolescent Psychiatry===
The department is dedicated to the study of [[developmental disorder]]s such as [[ADHD]], [[clinical depression]], [[autism]] and [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]]. In addition to research, the department offers two taught courses, a diploma in Child & Adolescent Psychiatry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/iopweb/studying/courses/?course_id=3 |title=King's College London - Study at IoP |publisher=Iop.kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> and an [[MSc]] in Child & Adolescent Mental Health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/iopweb/studying/courses/?course_id=12 |title=King's College London - Study at IoP |publisher=Iop.kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> The department has close links with the [[Michael Rutter]] Centre for Children and Young People at the Maudsley Hospital which has a number of specialist services for children and adolescents.

===Computing and Knowledge Management===
The computing team provides supports the computer network, file serving and image processing services. The knowledge management team provides information management support, encompassing library, records management and archive, e-learning, web and audio visual services.

===Forensic Mental Health Science===
[[Forensic Mental Health Science]] is the study of [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]], [[violent]], and [[Crime|criminal]] behaviours among people with [[mental disorder]]s. Clients may have a pattern of [[Anti-social behavior|antisocial behaviour]] that may include violence, crime, and substance abuse. The department's research focuses on antisocial [[Behavior|behaviour]] as it appears in people with either major mental disorders or [[personality disorder]]s. The objectives are to identify the causes of antisocial behaviour, create effective treatments, and prevent it from occurring in the first place. The department is closely allied to the Forensic Psychiatry Teaching Unit, which offers [[MSc]] courses in Clinical Forensic Psychology & Psychiatry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/iopweb/blob/downloads/locator/l_431_Clinical_leaflet.pdf |title=King's College London - Institute of Psychiatry |publisher=Iop.kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> and Forensic Mental Health Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/iopweb/blob/downloads/locator/l_431_Forensic_leaflet.pdf |title=King's College London - Institute of Psychiatry |publisher=Iop.kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref>

===Neuroscience===
[[Neuroscience]] is the study of the nervous system, primarily associated with the brain. Researchers in this department carry out a range of studies into diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[motor neuron disease]]. The Institute of Psychiatry now houses the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] [[Centre for Neurodegeneration Research]], where pioneering research is conducted investigating disease of the [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. This department offers an [[MSc]] course in Neuroscience, open to graduates from a range of backgrounds [http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/sites/neuroscience/?id=53 MSc Neuroscience].

===Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences===
[[Image:Iop cns.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the CNS building.]]
The Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences (CNS) is a joint venture of the King's College London Institute of Psychiatry  and the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM). Completed in early 2004, the centre provides, under one roof, an interdisciplinary research environment that combines the development of contemporary, high resolution structural, functional and metabolic mapping techniques, with expertise in the definition, diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.  The Clinical Neuroimaging Department, situated at the [[Maudsley Hospital]], provides a full range of neuroradiographic imaging services, including Plain [[Radiography]], [[Computed tomography|Computerised Tomography (CT)]], and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging| Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]]. For research studies, the CNS houses a dedicated GE 3.0T HDx MRI scanner (which is also made available for clinical and advanced clinical scanning, where appropriate). Additionally, there is a General Electric SIGNA 1.5T neuro-optimised [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] system housed in an adjacent building. Both machines (along with the clinical 1.5T scanner, also  General Electric HDx system) are capable of performing [[FMRI|functional]], [[Magnetic resonance spectroscopy|spectroscopic]], anatomical and pathological mapping techniques.

===Psychology===
[[Image:HWB.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Henry Wellcome Psychology Building.]]
The IOP Psychology department was founded in 1950 and is currently one of the largest communities of clinical and health psychologists in the world. The department conducts world-class research in [[neuropsychology]], [[forensic psychology]], and [[cognitive behavioural therapy]]. [[Hans Eysenck]] set up the UK's first qualification in [[clinical psychology]] in the department, which has now evolved into a three-year doctoral 'DClinPsych' qualification, with many of the course lectures delivered by leading experts in the field. The course has 20 students in each year, the majority of whom go on to become clinical psychologists in the [[National Health Service|NHS]]. Clinically, members of the department offer expert services to the [[Maudsley Hospital]], [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], [[King's College Hospital]], [[Guy's Hospital]] and community mental health teams in the South London area. Members of the department also teach psychology to undergraduate medical students from the [[United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals]]. Psychiatric geneticist [[Peter McGuffin]] was awarded a fellowship at the Institute.

[[Image:Sgdp.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the SGDP building.]]

===Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP)===
The SGDP centre is a multi-disciplinary research centre devoted to the study of the interplay between “nature” ([[genetics]]) and “nurture” (environment) as they interact in the development of complex human behaviour. Research at the SGDP acknowledges that there is no simple solution to the "[[nature versus nurture]]" debate; instead, expertise is combined across fields such as social [[epidemiology]], child and adult [[psychiatry]], [[developmental disorder|developmental psychopathology]], development in the family, personality traits, [[cognitive]] abilities, statistical genetics, and [[molecular genetics]]. In this way it is hoped that a greater understanding can be achieved in risk factors that might predispose an individual to depression, ADHD, or autism.

===[http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/departments/?locator=324 Section of Neurobiology of Psychosis]===
Our mission is to advance the understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our work on the major psychoses has focused on integrating cognitive measures and neuroimaging techniques, with perinatal, genetic and developmental data. The central aim is to characterize the core pathophysiological dimensions of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the belief that our knowledge of these disorders can eventually become synthesised into a more coherent understanding of mental functioning. Pioneering and evaluating treatment interventions to improve the lives of affected patients and their families. Research into the aetiology and pathophysiology of psychosis is vital for providing a theoretical framework for developing long-term treatment strategies. However, it is also important to contribute to research that has the potential of improving patients’ care and quality of life in the more immediate future. The section has therefore initiated or participated a number of such treatment studies of new atypical antipsychotics and potential mood stabilising medication and is also developing computerised and web-based applications for disease self-management. 
The section head is Dr. Sophia [[Sophia Frangou]] supported by 15 postdoctoral and doctoral researchers.
