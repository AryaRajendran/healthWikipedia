'''Swine influenza''', also called '''pig influenza''', '''swine flu''', '''hog flu''' and '''pig flu''', is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza [[virus]]es. '''Swine influenza virus''' ('''SIV''') or '''swine-origin influenza virus''' ('''S-OIV''') is any strain of the [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza family of viruses]] that is [[endemism|endemic]] in [[pig]]s.<ref name=Merck>{{cite journal|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121407.htm|title=Swine influenza|journal=The Merck Veterinary Manual|year=2008|accessdate=April 30, 2009|isbn=1-4421-6742-4}}</ref> As of 2009, the known SIV strains include [[Influenzavirus C|influenza C]] and the subtypes of [[Influenza A Virus|influenza A]] known as [[H1N1]], [[H1N2]], H2N1, [[H3N1]], [[H3N2]], and [[H2N3]].

Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to [[human flu]], often resulting only in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.

During the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general, namely [[chills]], [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, [[fatigue (medical)|weakness]] and [[malaise|general discomfort]].

In August 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] declared the swine flu [[pandemic]] officially over.

==History==
Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], when pigs became ill at the same time as humans.<ref name=Knobler>{{cite book|editor=Knobler S, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon S|title=The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997–1998, [[H3N2]] strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by [[reassortment]] from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and [[H3N2]] produced [[H1N2]]. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of [[H4N6]] crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm.<ref name="pmid12034486">{{cite journal|author=Olsen CW

Swine flu has been reported numerous times as a [[zoonosis]] in humans, usually with limited distribution, rarely with a widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry, primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market. For example, this disease costs the British meat industry about £65 million every year.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1136/vr.135.9.199|author=Kay RM, Done SH, Paton DJ|title=Effect of sequential porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza on the growth and performance of finishing pigs|journal=Vet.

Two weeks after his death, health officials announced the cause of death was a new strain of swine flu. The strain, a variant of H1N1, is known as <!-- start -->A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1)<!-- end -->.

The [[vaccination]] program was plagued by delays and public relations problems.<ref>Richard E. Neustadt and Harvey V. Fineberg. (1978). [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12660 The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease]. ''National Academies Press''.</ref> On October 1, 1976, immunizations began, and three senior citizens died soon after receiving their injections. This resulted in a media outcry that linked these deaths to the immunizations, despite the lack of any proof the vaccine was the cause. According to science writer Patrick Di Justo, however, by the time the truth was known—that the deaths were not proven to be related to the vaccine—it was too late. "The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu—now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations." This became a strong setback to the program.<ref name=DiJusto>[http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/28/1976_swine_flu/ "The Last Great Swine Flu Epidemic"], ''Salon.com'', April 28, 2009.</ref>

There were reports of [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], a paralyzing [[neuromuscular]] disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. Although if a link exists is still not clear, this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines. As a result, Di Justo writes, "the public refused to trust a government-operated health program that killed old people and crippled young people." In total, 48,161,019 Americans, or just over 22% of the population, had been immunized by the time the [[National Influenza Immunization Program]] was effectively halted on December 16, 1976.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Retailliau HF, Curtis AC, Storr G, Caesar G, Eddins DL, Hattwick MA|title=Illness after influenza vaccination reported through a nationwide surveillance system, 1976-1977|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=111|issue=3|pages=270–8|year=1980|month=March|pmid=7361749|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7361749}}</ref>

The virus was able to spread between people, since one to three health care personnel who had cared for the pregnant woman developed mild, influenza-like illnesses, and antibody tests suggested they had been infected with swine flu, but there was no community outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/key_facts.htm|title=Key Facts About Swine Flu (CDC)|publisher=Cdc.gov|date=|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref><ref name="pmid1845913">{{Cite journal|author=Wells DL|title=Swine influenza virus infections.

===1998 US outbreak in swine===
In 1998, swine flu was found in pigs in four U.S. states. Within a year, it had spread through pig populations across the United States. Scientists found this virus had originated in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans. This outbreak confirmed that pigs can serve as a crucible where novel influenza viruses emerge as a result of the reassortment of genes from different strains.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Stephanie Desmon|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/health/bal-swine-flu-strain0428,0,3165467.story|title=Expert: Swine flu virus more complex than typically seen|journal=Baltimore Sun|date=April 28, 2009|format=}} {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/04/why-the-pork-industry-hates-th.html|title=Pork industry is blurring the science of swine flu - Short Sharp Science|publisher=New Scientist|date=|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic? - 29 April 2009|publisher=New Scientist|date=|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> Genetic components of these 1998 triple-hybrid stains would later form six out of the eight viral gene segments in the 2009 flu outbreak.<ref name="hsus.org">[http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/swine_flu_virus_origin_1998_042909.html CDC Confirms Ties to Virus First Discovered in U.S. Pig Factories]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="hsus.org2">[http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/pubs/swine_flu.html Video Segments 3,4,5 in Flu Factories: Tracing the Origins of the Swine Flu Pandemic]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="video.hsus.org3">[http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=6d7c34894aab86190765da51973379a3438f294b Swine Flu Kept Stable Humans Untouched For 80 Years]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="video.hsus.org">[http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=6f816594cf08612a30048e72b5058afe4aeed401 Triple Hybrid Mutant Pig-Bird-Human Crossbreed Virus ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="North Carolina, 1998 Ground Zero">[http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=a89aa9c8dee6d32ec3dd828fe295222733cc1837 North Carolina, 1998 Ground Zero]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>

On July 27, 2007, the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) raised a hog cholera "red alert" warning over [[Metro Manila]] and five regions of Luzon after the disease spread to backyard pig farms in [[Bulacan]] and [[Pampanga]], even if these tested negative for the swine flu virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/56805/DA-probes-reported-swine-flu-outbreak-in-N-Ecija|title=DA probes reported swine flu 'outbreak' in N.

===2009 Northern Ireland outbreak in swine===

Since November 2009, 14 deaths as a result of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The majority of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12149164|title=New mothers urged to get swine flu vaccine|publisher=BBC News|date=2011-01-10|accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref>

==H1N1 virus pandemic history==
A study conducted in 2011, and published in the journal ''Nature'', has managed to establish the evolutionary origin of the flu strain of swine origin (S-OIV).<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7250/full/nature08182.html|title=Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A epidemic : Article|publisher=Nature|date=|accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>

The phylogenetic origin of the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic swine flu.

The new human H1N1 flu strain of avian origin kept transmitting among human populations until around 1957, when there was a co-infection between this strain and the avian H1N1 in humans. A reassortment event led to the development of a new strain (H2N2). From this point onwards, no outbreaks of H1N1 were reported in humans until around 1976.

New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now.

The mid-1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations.

The critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain.
Finally, the last step in S-OIV history was in 2009, when the virus H1N2 co-infected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain. This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain, which caused the 2009 pandemic.

On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu, which is the highest alert level.<ref name="Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010">Choffnes, Eileen R., Alison Mack, and David A. Relman. The Domestic and International Impacts of the 2009-H1N1 Influenza a Pandemic: Global Challenges, Global Solutions : Workshop Summary. Washington, D.C.: National Academies, 2010. Print.</ref> This alert level means that the swine flu had spread worldwide and there were cases of people with the virus in most countries.  The pandemic level identifies the spread of the disease or virus and not necessarily the severity of the disease.

Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high human-to-human transmission rate and due to the frequency of air travel.<ref name="Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010"/>

==Transmission==

===Transmission between pigs===
Influenza is quite common in pigs, with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US.<ref name=cfsph/> Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries.<ref name=cfsph/>

The main route of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals.<ref name=Kothalawala/> These close contacts are particularly common during animal transport. [[Intensive farming]] may also increase the risk of transmission, as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gilchrist MJ, Greko C, Wallinga DB, Beran GW, Riley DG, Thorne PS|title=The Potential Role of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in Infectious Disease Epidemics and Antibiotic Resistance|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=115|issue=2|pages=313–6|year=2007|month=February|pmid=17384785|pmc=1817683|doi=10.1289/ehp.8837}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Saenz RA, Hethcote HW, Gray GC|title=Confined Animal Feeding Operations as Amplifiers of Influenza|journal=Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases|volume=6|issue=4|pages=338–46|year=2006|pmid=17187567|pmc=2042988|doi=10.1089/vbz.2006.6.338}}</ref> The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses, or through dried mucus.

Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu).

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), in humans the symptoms of the 2009 "swine flu" H1N1 virus are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[sore throat]], body aches, [[headache]], [[chills]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. The 2009 outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/swineflu_you.htm|title=Swine Flu and You|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|date=2009-04-26|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu, as it is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but from person to person.

Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu, a [[differential diagnosis]] of ''probable'' swine flu requires not only symptoms, but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person's recent history. For example, during the [[2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States]], the CDC advised physicians to "consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with [[acute febrile respiratory illness]] who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu, or who were in one of the five U.S. states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the seven days preceding their illness onset."<ref name=CDCguideHD>{{cite web|title=CDC Health Update: Swine Influenza A (H1N1) Update: New Interim Recommendations and Guidance for Health Directors about Strategic National Stockpile Materiel|author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=Health Alert Network|date=April 27, 2009|url=http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/HAN/042609.htm|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}</ref> A diagnosis of ''confirmed'' swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample (a simple nose and throat swab).<ref name=CDCguideHD/>

==Prevention==
Prevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention in swine, prevention of transmission to humans, and prevention of its spread among humans.

===In swine===
Methods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I09|AA03}}). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient.

Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the [[evolution]] of the [[virus]] has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/swine_flu_virus_endemic/|publisher=National Hog Farmer|title=Swine flu virus turns endemic|date=15 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html|publisher=Novartis
|work=Custom Vaccines|title=Swine}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> 
Present [[Influenza vaccine|vaccination]] strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.<ref name="pmid17366454"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gramer MR, Lee JH, Choi YK, Goyal SM, Joo HS|title=Serologic and genetic characterization of North American H3N2 swine influenza A viruses|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=71|issue=3|pages=201–6|year=2007|month=July|pmid=17695595|pmc=1899866}}</ref> The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true/|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic?|date=2009-04-29}}</ref>

Facility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment. They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants.<ref name=Merck/> Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be [[quarantine]]d.<ref name=cfsph/> After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.<ref name=Merck/>

===In humans===
;Prevention of pig-to-human transmission
[[File:AntigenicShift HiRes vector.svg|thumb|]] Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the [[antigenic shift]]s can occur that create new influenza strains.
The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face [[surgical mask|mask]]s when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ramirez A, Capuano AW, Wellman DA, Lesher KA, Setterquist SF, Gray GC|title=Preventing Zoonotic Influenza Virus Infection|journal=Emerging Infect.

Recommendations to prevent spread of the virus among humans include using standard [[Influenza#Infection control|infection control]], which includes frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with [[Hand sanitizer|alcohol-based hand sanitizers]], especially after being out in public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdc.gov/swineflu/investigation.htm|title=CDC - Influenza (Flu) &#124; Swine Influenza (Flu) Investigation|publisher=Cdc.gov|date=|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterandhealth.org/newsletter/new/winter_2005/chlorine_bleach.html

Experts agree hand-washing can help prevent viral infections, including ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu.<ref name="2009 H1N1 Swine Flu and You" /> Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth. [[Hand sanitizer|Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers]] work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough or muscle aches, should stay away from work or public transportation, and should contact a doctor for advice.<ref name="How to protect yourself?">{{cite web| url=http://pn.lifehugger.com/doc/989/Swine_Flu|title=Self protection measures|publisher=LHC|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref>

[[Social distancing]], another tactic, is staying away from other people who might be infected, and can include avoiding large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community. [[Public health]] and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions, depending on the severity of the outbreak.

====Vaccination====
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic vaccine}}
[[Vaccine]]s are available for different kinds of swine flu. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15, 2009.<ref name="Vaccine approval news release">{{cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm182399.htm|title=FDA Approves Vaccines for 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus|publisher=FDA|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref> Studies by the [[National Institutes of Health]] show a single dose creates enough antibodies to protect against the virus within about 10 days.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web| url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_89221.html|title=NIH studies  on Swine flu vaccine|publisher=NIH|accessdate=2009-10-15}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic, several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines.  These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans <ref>Uscher-Pines, Lori, Jurgen Maurer, and Katherine M. Harris. "Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Uptake And Location Of Vaccination For 2009-H1N1 And Seasonal Influenza." American Journal Of Public Health 101.7 (2011): 1252-1255. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 6 Dec. 2011.</ref> This could be due to several factors.  Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans.  Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective.  This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study.  Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor’s offices.  Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.

==Treatment==

===In swine===
As swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required.<ref name=cfsph>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/influenza.pdf|title=Influenza Factsheet|publisher=Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University}}</ref> Instead, veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm, or to other farms.<ref name=Kothalawala/> Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts. Antibiotics are also used to treat this disease, which although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial [[pneumonia]] and other [[secondary infection]]s in influenza-weakened herds.<ref name="cfsph"/>

===In humans===
If a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends the use of [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) or [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs.<ref>http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/faq/en/index.html</ref> The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/antiviral_swine.htm|title=Antiviral Drugs and Swine Influenza|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>

In the U.S., on April 27, 2009, the FDA issued [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s to make available [[Relenza]] and [[Tamiflu]] [[antiviral drug]]s to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they are currently unapproved. The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs, including by  volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm149571.htm|title=''FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of Influenza Medicines, Diagnostic Test in Response to Swine Flu Outbreak in Humans.''
