The '''obturator externus muscle''' (OE) is a flat, triangular muscle, which covers the outer surface of the anterior wall of the [[pelvis]]. 

It is sometimes considered part of the [[medial compartment of thigh]],<ref name="isbn0-7817-5484-4">{{cite book |author=Sauerland, Eberhardt K.; Patrick W., PhD. Tank; Tank, Patrick W. |title=Grant's dissector |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2005 |isbn=0-7817-5484-4 |oclc= |doi= |page=129}}</ref> and sometimes considered part of the [[gluteal]] region.<ref name="titleSummary of Lower Limb">{{cite web |url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm |title=Summary of Lower Limb |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=}}</ref>

==Origin and insertion==
It arises from the margin of bone immediately around the medial side of the [[obturator foramen]], viz., from the rami of the pubis, and the inferior ramus of the [[ischium]]; it also arises from the medial two-thirds of the outer surface of the [[obturator membrane]], and from the tendinous arch which completes the canal for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves. 

The fibers springing from the pubic arch extend on to the inner surface of the bone, where they obtain a narrow origin between the margin of the foramen and the attachment of the obturator membrane. 

The fibers converge and pass posterolateral and upward, and end in a tendon which runs across the back of the neck of the femur and lower part of the capsule of the hip joint and is inserted into the [[trochanteric fossa]] of the femur.

==Relations==
The obturator vessels lie between the muscle and the obturator membrane; the [[anterior branch of the obturator nerve]] reaches the thigh by passing in front of the muscle, and the [[Posterior branch of obturator nerve|posterior branch]] by piercing it.

== Variation ==

In 33% of people a [[Supernumerary body part|supernumerary]] muscle is found between the [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]] and [[Adductor minimus muscle|minimus]].  While this muscle, when present, is similar to its neighbouring adductors, it is formed by separation from the superficial layer of the obturator externus, and is thus not [[ontogeny|ontogentically]] related to the [[adductor muscles of the hip]].  This muscle originates from the upper part of the [[inferior pubic ramus|inferior ramus of the pubis]] from where it runs downwards and laterally. In half of cases, it inserts into the anterior surface of the insertion [[aponeurosis]] of the adductor minimus. In the remaining cases, it is either inserted into the upper part of the [[pectineal line (pubis)|pectineal line]] or the posterior part of the [[lesser trochanter]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1436954 |year=1992 |last1=Nakamura |first1=E |last2=Masumi |first2=S |last3=Miura |first3=M |last4=Kato |first4=S |last5=Miyauchi |first5=R |title=A supernumerary muscle between the adductors brevis and minimus in humans |volume=69 |issue=2–3 |pages=89–98 |journal=Okajimas folia anatomica Japonica}}</ref>

It has been demonstrated by the course of the [[posterior branch of obturator nerve]] that the obturator externus is divided into a superior [[Muscle fascicle|fasciculus]] and a main belly.  The supernumerary muscle described above originates from the superior fasciculus, while an anomalous fasciculus&nbsp;— also derived from the obturator externus&nbsp;— originates from the main belly.  The "original" obturator externus, i.e. without these supernumerary muscular parts, actually occurs in only 20% of cases, and apparently the obturator externus readily undergoes [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] variations.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15134328 |year=2004 |last1=Yatsunami |first1=M |last2=Tai |first2=T |last3=Irie |first3=Y |last4=Ogawa |first4=K |last5=Miyauchi |first5=R |title=A morphological study on the human obturator externus muscle with reference to anomalous muscle and anomalous fasciculus originating from the obturator externus muscle |volume=80 |issue=5–6 |pages=103–14 |journal=Okajimas folia anatomica Japonica}}</ref>
