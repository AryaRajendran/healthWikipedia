'''FRAX''' is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate the 10-year probability of [[bone fracture]] risk. It was developed by the [[World Health Organization]] Collaborating Centre for Metabolic Bone Diseases at [[Sheffield University]].<ref name=FRAX>{{cite web |url= http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/index.jsp|title=WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref> FRAX integrates clinical risk factors and [[bone mineral density]] at the [[femoral neck]] to calculate the 10-year probability of hip fracture and the 10-year probability of a major [[osteoporosis|osteoporotic]] fracture (clinical spine, forearm, hip or shoulder fracture).<ref name=WHO>{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/pdfs/WHO_Technical_Report.pdf|title= WHO Scientific Group Technical Review of FRAX|year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>

FRAX is freely accessible online, and commercially available as a [http://www.who-frax.org/ desktop application], in paper-form as a FRAX Pad, and as an [http://www.doctot.com/doctot-apps/frax-app/ iPhone application]. The tool is compatible with 58 models for 53 countries, and is available in 28 languages.<ref name=FRAX /> 

The models used to develop the FRAX diagnostic tool were derived from studying patient populations in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.<ref name=OI>{{cite journal |pmc= 2267485|title=Osteoporosis International |year=2011 | pmid=18292978 |doi=10.1007/s00198-007-0543-5 |volume=19 |issue=4 |author=Kanis JA, Johnell O, Oden A, Johansson H, McCloskey E |journal=Osteoporos Int |pages=385â€“97}}</ref> Clinical risk factors assessed include a prior fragility fracture, parental history of hip fracture, current tobacco smoking, long-term use of glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis, other causes of secondary osteoporosis and daily alcohol consumption. FRAX assessments are intended to provide guidance for determining access to treatment in healthcare systems.<ref name=IOF>{{cite web |url= http://www.iofbonehealth.org/health-professionals/frax.html|title=International Osteoporosis Foundation |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>

FRAX is incorporated into many national guidelines around the world, including those of Belgium, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, UK (NOGG), and US (NOF).
