'''Monoclonal antibody therapy''' is the use of [[monoclonal antibodies]] (or mAb) to specifically bind to target cells or proteins. This may then stimulate the patient's [[immune system]] to attack those cells. It is possible to create a mAb specific to almost any [[extracellular]]/ cell surface target, and thus there is a large amount of research and development currently being undertaken to create monoclonals for numerous serious diseases (such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and different types of [[cancer]]s). There are a number of ways that mAbs can be used for therapy. For example: mAb therapy can be used to destroy malignant [[tumor]] cells and prevent tumor growth by blocking specific cell receptors. Variations also exist within this treatment, e.g. [[radioimmunotherapy]], where a radioactive dose localizes on target cell line, delivering lethal chemical doses to the target.<ref name=Waldmann>{{cite journal |author=Waldmann, Thomas A.|title=Immunotherapy: past, present and future |journal=Nature Medicine |year=2003 |volume=9 |issue= 3|pages= 269–277 |url=http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nm/journal/v9/n3/full/nm0303-269.html&filetype=pdf|doi=10.1038/nm0303-269 |pmid=12612576

==Structure and function of human and therapeutic antibodies==
{{See|Monoclonal antibodies}}
[[Immunoglobulin]] G ([[IgG]]) antibodies are large [[heterodimer]]ic molecules, approximately 150 [[kDa]] and are composed of two different kinds of [[polypeptide]] chain, called the heavy (~50kDa) and the light chain (~25kDa). There are two types of light chains, kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). By cleavage with enzyme [[papain]], the [[antibody|Fab]] (''fragment-antigen binding'') part can be separated from the [[Fc region|Fc]] (''fragment constant'') part of the molecule (see image). The Fab fragments contain the variable domains, which consist of three antibody [[Hypervariable region|hypervariable amino acid]] domains responsible for the antibody specificity embedded into constant regions. There are four known IgG subclasses all of which are involved in [[Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity]].<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | last = Janeway | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Janeway | coauthors = Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik | title = Immunobiology; Fifth Edition | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2001 | location = New York and London| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10| isbn = 0-8153-4101-6}}</ref>

The immune system responds to the environmental factors it encounters on the basis of discrimination between self and non-self. Tumor [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are not specifically targeted by one's immune system since tumor cells are the patient's own cells.
Tumor cells, however are highly abnormal, and many display unusual [[antigen]]s that are either inappropriate for the cell type, its environment, or are only normally present during the organisms' development (e.g. [[fetus|fetal]] antigens).<ref name=Janeway/>

Other tumor cells display [[cell surface receptor]]s that are rare or absent on the surfaces of healthy cells, and which are responsible for activating cellular [[signal transduction]] pathways that cause the unregulated growth and division of the tumor cell. Examples include [[ErbB2]], a constitutively active cell surface receptor that is produced at abnormally high levels on the surface of approximately 30% of [[breast cancer]] tumor cells. Such breast cancer is known a [[HER2]] positive breast cancer.<ref name=Janeway6>{{cite book | author =  [[Charles Janeway|Janeway CA, Jr.]] ''et al.''  | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 6th | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-443-07310-4}}</ref>

[[Antibody|Antibodies]] are a key component of the [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]], playing a central role in both in the recognition of foreign antigens and the stimulation of an immune response to them. The advent of [[monoclonal antibody]] technology has made it possible to raise antibodies against specific antigens presented on the surfaces of tumors.<ref name=Janeway6/>

[[Immunotherapy]] developed as a technique with the discovery of the structure of [[antibodies]] and the development of [[hybridoma]] technology, which provided the first reliable source of [[monoclonal antibodies]].<ref name=Kohler>{{cite journal |author=Köhler G, Milstein C |title=Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity |journal=Nature |volume=256 |issue=5517 |pages=495–7 |year=1975 |month=August |pmid=1172191 |doi=10.1038/256495a0 |bibcode=1975Natur.256..495K}}</ref> These advances allowed for the specific targeting of tumors both [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]].

Throughout the progression of monoclonal drug development there have been four major antibody types developed: murine, chimeric, humanised and human.

Initial therapeutic antibodies were simple murine [[analog (chemistry)|analogues]], which contributed to the early lack of success. It has since been shown that these antibodies have: a short half-life in vivo (due to [[immune complex]] formation), limited penetration into tumour sites, and that they inadequately recruit host effector functions.<ref name=Stern>{{cite journal |author=Stern M, Herrmann R |title=Overview of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy: present and promise |journal=Crit.

Chimeric and humanized antibodies have generally replaced murine antibodies in modern therapeutic antibody applications. Hybridoma technology has been replaced by [[recombinant DNA technology]], [[transgenic]] mice and [[phage display]].<ref name=Hudson>{{cite journal |author=Hudson PJ, Souriau C |title=Engineered antibodies |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=129–34 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12514726 |doi=10.1038/nm0103-129 }}</ref>  Understanding of [[proteomics]] has proven essential in identifying novel tumour targets.

===Murine monoclonal antibodies (suffix ''-omab'')===
Initially, [[murine]] antibodies were obtained by hybridoma technology, for which Kohler and Milstein received a Nobel prize. However the dissimilarity between murine and human immune systems led to the clinical failure of these antibodies, except in some specific circumstances. Major problems associated with murine antibodies included reduced stimulation of [[cytotoxic]]ity  and the formation complexes after repeated administration, which resulted in mild [[allergic reaction]]s and sometimes [[anaphylactic shock]].<ref name=Stern/>

===Chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies (suffixes ''-ximab'', ''-zumab'' respectively)===
To reduce murine antibody [[immunogenicity]], murine molecules were engineered to remove immunogenic content and to increase their immunologic efficiency.<ref name=Stern/> This was initially achieved by the production of [[chimeric antibody|chimeric]] and [[humanized antibodies]]. Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Human gene sequences, taken from the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain, results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces immunogenicity, and thus increases [[blood serum|serum]] [[half-life]].

Humanised antibodies are produced by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. This results in a molecule of approximately 95% human origin. However it has been shown in several studies that humanised antibodies bind antigen much more weakly than the parent murine monoclonal antibody, with reported decreases in affinity of up to several hundredfold.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carter P, Presta L, Gorman CM, ''et al.'' |title=Humanization of an anti-p185HER2 antibody for human cancer therapy |journal=Proc.

===Human monoclonal antibodies (suffix ''-umab'')===
Human monoclonal antibodies are produced using [[transgenic]] mice or [[phage display]] libraries. Human monoclonal antibodies are produced by transferring human immunoglobulin genes into the murine genome, after which the transgenic mouse is [[vaccinated]] against the desired antigen, leading to the production of monoclonal antibodies.,<ref name=Hudson/> allowing the transformation of murine antibodies in vitro into fully human antibodies.<ref name=Janeway6/>

The heavy and light chains of human IgG proteins are expressed in structural polymorphic (allotypic) forms. Human IgG allotype has been considered as one of the many factors that can contribute to immunogenecity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jefferis|first=Roy|coauthors=Marie-Paule Lefranc|title=Human immunoglobulin allotypes|journal=MAbs|year=2009|month=July/August|volume=1|issue=4|pages=332–338|doi=10.4161/mabs.1.4.9122|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/17/article/9122/|pmid=20073133|pmc=2726606}}</ref> The general scheme of a monoclonal antibody development program is described in.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Kathryn|coauthors=Nick Pullen, Lee Coney, Maggie Dempster, Laura Andrews, Jeffrey Bajramovic, Paul Baldrick, Lorrene Buckley, Abby Jacobs, Geoff Hale, Colin Green, Ian Ragan and Vicky Robinson|title=Preclinical development of monoclonal antibodies|journal=MAbs|year=2009|volume=1|issue=5|doi=10.4161/mabs.1.5.9676|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/17/article/9676/|pages=505–516|pmid=20065651|pmc=2759500}}</ref>

== Targeted conditions ==
===Cancer===
Anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies can be targeted against malignant cells by several mechanisms:

*[[Radioimmunotherapy]] (RIT) involves the use of [[radioactive]]ly conjugated murine antibodies against cellular antigens. Most research currently involved their application to [[lymphomas]], as these are highly radio-sensitive malignancies. To limit radiation exposure, murine antibodies were especially chosen, as their high immunogenicity promotes rapid clearance from the body. [[Tositumomab]] is an exemplar used for non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

*Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy ([[ADEPT (medicine)|ADEPT]]) involves the application of cancer associated monoclonal antibodies which are linked to a drug-activating enzyme. Subsequent systemic administration of a non-toxic agent results in its conversion to a toxic drug, and resulting in a cytotoxic effect which can be targeted at malignant cells. The clinical success of ADEPT treatments has been limited to date.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Francis RJ, Sharma SK, Springer C, ''et al.'' |title=A phase I trial of antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma or other CEA producing tumours |journal=Br J Cancer |volume=87 |pages=600–7 |year=2002 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6600517 |pmid=12237768 |issue=6 |pmc=2364249 }}</ref> However it holds great promise, and recent reports suggest that it will have a role in future oncological treatment.

*[[Immunoliposome]]s are antibody-conjugated [[liposomes]]. Liposomes can carry drugs or therapeutic [[nucleotide]]s and when conjugated with monoclonal antibodies, may be directed against malignant cells. Although this technique is still in its infancy, significant advances have been made.  Immunoliposomes have been successfully used in vivo to achieve targeted delivery of tumour-suppressing genes into tumours, using an antibody fragment against the human [[transferrin]] receptor. Tissue-specific gene delivery using immunoliposomes has also been achieved in brain, and breast cancer tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krauss WC, Park JW, Kirpotin DB, Hong K, Benz CC |title=Emerging antibody-based HER2 (ErbB-2/neu) therapeutics |journal=Breast Dis |volume=11 |pages=113–124 |year=2000 |pmid=15687597 }}</ref>

===Autoimmune diseases===
Monoclonal antibodies used for [[autoimmune disease]]s include [[infliximab]] and [[adalimumab]], which are effective in [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative Colitis]] by their ability to bind to and inhibit [[TNF-α]].<ref name=Rang>{{cite book |author=Rang, H. P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |page=241 |isbn=0-443-07145-4 }}</ref> [[Basiliximab]] and [[daclizumab]] inhibit [[interleukin-2|IL-2]] on activated [[T cells]] and thereby help preventing acute [[organ rejection|rejection]] of kidney transplants.<ref name=Rang/> [[Omalizumab]] inhibits human [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) and is useful in moderate-to-severe allergic [[asthma]].

==FDA approved therapeutic antibodies==
{{Mainlist|List of monoclonal antibodies}}
The first FDA-approved therapeutic monoclonal antibody was a murine IgG2a CD3 specific [[transplant rejection]] drug, [[OKT3]] (also called muromonab), in 1986. This drug found use in solid [[organ transplant]] recipients who became [[corticosteroid|steroid]] resistant.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hooks MA, Wade CS, Millikan WJ |title=Muromonab CD-3: a review of its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical use in transplantation |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=11 |pages=26–37 |year=1991 |pmid=1902291 |issue=1 }}</ref> Hundreds of therapies are undergoing [[clinical trials]]. Most are concerned with immunological and oncological targets.

Recently, the [[bispecific antibodies]], a novel class of therapeutic antibodies, have yielded promising results in clinical trials.

==Economics==
Since 2000, the therapeutic market for monoclonal antibodies has grown exponentially. The current “big 5” therapeutic antibodies on the market are [[bevacizumab]], [[trastuzumab]] (both oncology), [[adalimumab]], [[infliximab]] (both [[autoimmune and inflammatory disorder]]s, ‘AIID’) and [[rituximab]] (oncology and AIID) accounted for 80% of revenues in 2006.
