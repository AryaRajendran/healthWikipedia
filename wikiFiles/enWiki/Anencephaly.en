'''Anencephaly''' is a [[cephalic disorder]] that results from a [[neural tube defect]] that occurs when the rostral (head) end of the [[neural tube]] fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th day of conception,<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Rahilly |first1=M |last2=Muller |first2=F |title=Human Embryology & Teratology |publisher=Wiley-Liss, Inc |location=New York |year=1992 |page=253}}</ref> resulting in the absence of a major portion of the [[brain]], [[skull]], and [[scalp]].<ref name="neurologychannel">{{cite web |url=http://www.neurologychannel.com/cephalicdisorders/index.shtml |title=Cephalic disorders - Overview, Anencephaly, Colpocephaly - neurologychannel |accessdate=May 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080509092319/http://www.neurologychannel.com/cephalicdisorders/index.shtml| archivedate= 9 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Strictly speaking, the translation of the Greek term to English is "no brain" (that is, totally lacking), but it is accepted that [[child]]ren with this disorder are born without a [[telencephalon]], the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] hemispheres, including the [[neocortex]], which is responsible for  [[cognition]]. The remaining brain tissue is often exposed, i.e. not covered by bone or skin.<ref name="NINDS"/> With very few exceptions,<ref name="koaa.com">[http://www.koaa.com/videos/boy-without-a-brain/?fullsite koaa.com], Baby Without A Brain, Nickolas Coke, Update</ref> most babies with this disorder do not survive.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Anencephaly.jpg|thumb|An anencephalic dead newborn|100px]]

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) describes the presentation of this condition as follows: "A baby born with anencephaly is usually [[blindness|blind]], [[deafness|deaf]], [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], and unable to feel [[pain]]. Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a main [[brainstem|brain stem]], the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining [[consciousness]]. [[Reflex]] actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur."<ref name="NINDS">{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anencephaly/anencephaly.htm |title=Anencephaly Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)}}</ref>

==Causes==
The cause of anencephaly is disputed. Generally, neural tube defects do not follow direct patterns of [[heredity]], though there is some indirect evidence of inheritance,<ref name="pmid2333913">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320360119 |title=Evidence for a major gene in familial anencephaly |year=1990 |last1=Shaffer |first1=Lisa G. |last2=Marazita |first2=Mary L. |last3=Bodurtha |first3=Joann |last4=Newlin |first4=Anna |last5=Nance |first5=Walter E. |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=36 |pages=97–101 |pmid=2333913 |issue=1}}</ref> and recent animal models indicate a possible association with deficiencies of the [[transcription factor]] [[TEAD2]].<ref name="pmid17868131">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dvg.20330 |title=Transcription factor TEAD2 is involved in neural tube closure |year=2007 |last1=Kaneko |first1=Kotaro J. |last2=Kohn |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Liu |first3=Chengyu |last4=Depamphilis |first4=Melvin L. |journal=Genesis |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=577–87 |pmid=17868131 |pmc=2765819}}</ref> Studies show that a woman who has had one child with a neural tube defect such as anencephaly has about a 3% risk of having another child with a neural tube defect,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320050314 |title=The recurrence risk for neural tube defects in the United States: A collaborative study |year=1980 |last1=Cowchock |first1=S. |last2=Ainbender |first2=E. |last3=Prescott |first3=G. |last4=Crandall |first4=B. |last5=Lau |first5=L. |last6=Heller |first6=R. |last7=Muir |first7=W.

It is known that women taking certain medications for [[epilepsy]] and women with insulin-dependent diabetes have a higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/anencephaly |title=Anencephaly |publisher=National Institutes of Health |date=22 August 2011 |work=Genetics Home Reference |accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref> [[Genetic counseling]] is usually offered to women at a higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect to discuss available testing.

Recent studies have shown that the addition of [[folic acid]] to the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of women of child-bearing age may significantly reduce, although not eliminate, the incidence of neural tube defects. Therefore, it is recommended that all women of child-bearing age consume 0.4&nbsp;mg of folic acid daily,<ref name="NINDS"/> especially those attempting to conceive or who may possibly conceive, as this can reduce the risk to 0.03%.<ref name="Ratcliffe obstetrics">{{cite book |editor1-first=Stephen D. |editor1-last=Ratcliffe |title=Family medicine obstetrics |year=2008 |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |location=Philadephia |isbn=0-323-04306-2 |edition=3rd}}{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> It is not advisable to wait until pregnancy has begun, since by the time a woman knows she is pregnant, the critical time for the formation of a neural tube defect has usually already passed. A [[physician]] may prescribe even higher dosages of folic acid(4&nbsp;mg/day) for women who have had a previous pregnancy with a neural tube defect.<ref name="Ratcliffe obstetrics" />

Anencephaly and other physical and mental deformities have also been blamed on a high exposure to such toxins as [[lead]], [[chromium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[nickel]].<ref>Goldsmith, Alexander (1996, quoted by Millen and Holtz, "Dying for Growth"){{vs|need more bibliographic info|date=October 2012}}</ref>

=== Relation to genetic ciliopathy ===
Until recently, medical literature did not indicate a connection among many [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their [[genotype|root cause]] despite the widely varying set of medical [[phenotype|symptoms]] that are clinically visible in the [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]]. Anencephaly is one such disease, part of an [[emergence|emerging]] class of diseases called [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary [[cilia]] structures of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[organelle]]s which are present in many cellular types throughout the [[human]] body. The cilia defects adversely affect "numerous critical developmental signaling pathways" essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often [[pleiotropic|multi-symptom]] nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]], and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115610 |title=The Ciliopathies: An Emerging Class of Human Genetic Disorders |year=2006 |last1=Badano |first1=Jose L. |last2=Mitsuma |first2=Norimasa |last3=Beales |first3=Phil L. |last4=Katsanis |first4=Nicholas |journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics |volume=7 |pages=125–48 |pmid=16722803}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 066.jpg|thumb|Ultrasound image of fetus with anencephaly]]
Anencephaly can often be diagnosed before birth through an [[ultrasound]] examination. The maternal serum [[alpha-fetoprotein]] ([[AFP screening]])<ref name="pmid17602445">{{cite journal |author=Joó JG, Beke A, Papp C, ''et al.'' |title=Neural tube defects in the sample of genetic counselling |journal=Prenat. Diagn. |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=912–21 |year=2007 |pmid=17602445 |doi=10.1002/pd.1801}}</ref> and detailed fetal ultrasound<ref name="pmid16862467">{{cite journal |author=Cedergren M, Selbing A |title=Detection of fetal structural abnormalities by an 11-14-week ultrasound dating scan in an unselected Swedish population |journal=Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica |volume=85 |issue=8 |pages=912–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16862467 |doi=10.1080/00016340500448438}}</ref> can be useful for screening for neural tube defects such as [[spina bifida]] or anencephaly.

=== Meroanencephaly ===
Meronanencephaly is a rare form of anencephaly characterized by malformed [[cranial]] bones, a median cranial defect, and a cranial protrusion called area cerebrovasculosa. Area cerebrovasculosa is a section of abnormal, spongy, [[vascular tissue]] admixed with glial tissue ranging from simply a membrane to a large mass of [[connective tissue]], hemorrhagic vascular channels, glial nodules, and disorganized [[choroid plexuses]].<ref name= Meroanencephaly>{{cite journal|doi=10.1159/000263862 |title=Meroanencephaly: Pathology and Prenatal Diagnosis |year=1993 |last1=Isada |first1=Nelson B.|last2=Qureshi |first2=Faisal |last3=Jacques |first3=Suzanne M. |last4=Holzgreve |first4=Wolfgang |last5=Tout |first5=Mary Jo|last6=Johnson |first6=Mark P. |last7=Evans |first7=Mark I. |journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy |volume=8 |issue=6|pages=423–8 |pmid=8286034}}</ref>

=== Holo anencephaly ===
The most common type of anencephaly, in which the brain is completely absent.<ref name= Meroanencephaly/>

=== Craniorachischisis ===

The most severe type of anencephaly where area cerebrovasculosa and area medullovasculosa fill both cranial defects and the [[spinal column]].  Craniorachischisis is characterized by anencephaly accompanied by bony defects in the [[spine]] and the exposure of [[neural tissue]].<ref name= Meroanencephaly/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0976-3147.63108|title=Craniorachischisis totalis |year=2010 |last1=Murlimanju |last2=Vishal |first2=K |last3=Maligi |first3=AM |last4=Naveen|first4=NS |journal=Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice |volume=1 |pages=54–5 |pmid=21799625 |first1=N |issue=1|pmc=3137839}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}

There is no cure or standard treatment for anencephaly and the prognosis for patients is death. Most anencephalic fetuses do not survive birth, accounting for 55% of non-aborted cases. If the infant is not [[stillbirth|stillborn]], then he or she will usually die within a few hours or days after birth from [[cardiorespiratory arrest]].<ref name="NINDS">{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anencephaly/anencephaly.htm |title=Anencephaly Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |accessdate = 2008-05-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080509155348/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anencephaly/anencephaly.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Kinsman |first1=SL |last2=Johnston |first2=MV |editor1-first=RM |editor1-last=Kliegman |editor2-first=RE |editor2-last=Behrman |editor3-first=HB |editor3-last=Jenson |editor4-last=Stanton |title=Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics |edition=18th |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2007 |chapter=Chapter 592: Congenital anomalies of the central nervous system |isbn=1-4377-0755-6 |editor-first=BF }}</ref>

Three recorded cases of anencephalic children surviving for longer periods of time are [[Baby K|Stephanie Keene]] of [[Falls Church, Virginia]], who lived for 2 years 174 days; Vitoria de Cristo, born in Brazil in January 2010 and surviving until July 17, 2012;<ref>{{cite web|title=Beloved Vitoria Blog|url=http://www.belovedvitoria.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/our-beloved-vitoria-is-now-with-christ.html|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref> and Nickolas Coke<ref name="Nickolas Coke">{{cite web |url=http://www.koaa.com/videos/boy-without-a-brain/?fullsite |title=Boy without a brain|accessdate = 2012-07-16| archiveurl=http://www.koaa.com/videos/boy-without-a-brain/?fullsite| archivedate= 12 July 2012 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> of [[Pueblo, Colorado]], who lived for 3 years and 11 months, died October 31, 2012.<ref>http://lmg.letmeget.net/node/493</ref><ref>http://www.koaa.com/news/miracle-child-born-without-brain-dies-in-pueblo/</ref>

In almost all cases, anencephalic infants are not aggressively [[resuscitation|resuscitated]] because there is no chance of the infant ever achieving a conscious existence. Instead, the usual clinical practice is to offer [[Rehydration|hydration]], [[food|nutrition]], and [[comfort measures]] and to "let nature take its course". Artificial ventilation, surgery (to fix any co-existing congenital defects), and drug therapy (such as [[antibiotics]]) are usually regarded as futile efforts.  Some clinicians and medical ethicists view even the provision of nutrition and hydration as medically futile.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Epidemiology==
In the [[United States]], anencephaly occurs in about 1 out of every 10,000 births.<ref name="disease frequency">{{cite web |publisher=PubMed Health |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002547/ |title=Anencephaly |date=May 1, 2011}}</ref> Research has suggested that, overall, female babies are more likely to be affected by the disorder.<ref name="sexratio">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00958926 |title=The sex ratio in anencephaly |year=1970 |last1=Timson |first1=J. |journal=Genetica |volume=41 |pages=457–65 |pmid=4922971 |issue=3}}</ref>

== Ethical issues ==
=== Organ donation ===
One issue concerning anencephalic newborns is [[organ donation]]. Initial legal guidance came from the case of Baby Theresa in 1992, in which the boundaries of organ donation were tested for the first time.<ref name="Bard">{{cite journal |first1=Jennifer S. |last1=Bard |pmid=12774804 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.wne.edu/lawreview/vol21/iss1/3 |year=1999 |title=The diagnosis is anencephaly and the parents ask about organ donation: Now what? A guide for hospital counsel and ethics committees |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=49–95 |journal=Western New England Law Review}}</ref> Infant organs are scarce, and the high demand for pediatric [[organ transplants]] poses a major public health issue. In 1999, it was found that among children who die under the age of two, thirty to fifty percent do so while awaiting transplant.<ref name="Bard"/> In order for infant organs to be viable and used for transplant, they must be removed while the infant still has circulation or very soon after circulation has ceased. However, this poses both legal and ethical issues. In the United States, all states have laws that forbid the removal of organs from a donor until after the donor has died, except in the case of altruistic living donations of a kidney or liver segment.

The goal of those in support of organ donation is that it will further contribute to the pool of suitable organs for transplants while the need for lifesaving organ transplants is so great. It has been estimated that 400-500 infant hearts and kidneys and 500-1,000 infant livers are needed in the United States each year.<ref name="Meinke">{{cite web |last=Meinke |first=Sue |title=Anencephalic Infants as Potential Organ Sources: Ethical and Legal Issues |url=http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/publications/scopenotes/sn12.pdf |publisher=National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature |accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref> Because anencephalic [[neonates]] have partially functioning [[brain stem]]s, they possess some brain stem reflexes such as spontaneous respirations. For this reason, these patients cannot be declared brain dead.

Within the medical community, the main ethical issues with organ donation are a misdiagnosis of anencephaly, the [[slippery slope]] argument, that anencephalic neonates would rarely be a source of organs, and that it would undermine confidence in organ transplantation.<ref name="CEJA">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520440068039 |title=The Use of Anencephalic Neonates as Organ Donors |year=1995 |last1=Glasson |first1=John |last2=Plows |first2=Charles W. |last3=Clarke |first3=Oscar W. |last4=Cosgriff |first4=James H. |last5=Kliger |first5=Craig H. |last6=Ruff |first6=Victoria N. |last7=Tenery |first7=Robert M. |last8=Wilkins |first8=George T. |last9=Orentlicher |first9=David |journal=JAMA |volume=273 |issue=20 |pmid=7745776}}</ref> Slippery slope concerns are a major issue in personhood debates, across the board. In regards to anencephaly, those who oppose organ donation argue that it could open the door for involuntary organ donors such as an elderly person with severe dementia. Another point of contention is the number of children who would actually benefit. There are discrepancies in statistics; however, it is known that most anencephalic children are stillborn.<ref name="CEJA"/>

Proposals have been made to bypass the legal and ethical issues surrounding organ donation. These include waiting for death to occur before procuring organs, expanding the definition of death, creating a special legal category for anencephalic infants, and defining them as non-persons.<ref name="Ahmad">{{cite journal |pmid=1735049 |year=1992 |last1=Ahmad |first1=Ferhaan |title=Anencephalic infants as organ donors: Beware the slippery slope |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=236–41, 244 |pmc=1488368 |journal=CMAJ}}</ref>

=== Brain death ===
There are four different concepts used to determine [[brain death]]: failure of heart and lungs, whole brain death, and [[neocortical]] death. Some argue that anencephalics experience neocortical death, in which there is an irreversible loss of consciousness and self-awareness, two determinants of a person. Brain death is another source of support for organ donation.<ref name="Ryskamp">{{cite web|last=Ryskamp|first=Jessica|title=Anencephaly: Concepts of Personhood, Ethical Questions, and Nursing Care|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&context=honors|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>

Neocortical death, similar to a [[persistent vegetative state]] (PVS), involves loss of cognitive functioning of the brain. A proposal by law professor, David Smith, in an attempt to prove that neocortical death should legally be treated the same as brain death, involved [[PET scans]] to determine the similarities. However this is not a well-received proposal considering the contradicting views on classifying brain death.<ref name= "Beresford">{{cite web|last=Beresford|title=Ethics in Neuroscience: Mind over Matter|url=http://poynter.indiana.edu/publications/m-beresford.pdf|publisher=Indiana University}}</ref>

=== Pregnancy termination ===
Anencephaly can be diagnosed prenatally with a high degree of accuracy. Given that anencephaly is a fatal condition, parents receive the option of [[abortion]] either in the second or [[third trimester]] of pregnancy, depending on the abortion laws in the state.<ref name="Meinke"/> In 2012, Brazil extended the right of abortion to mothers with anencephalic fetuses. This decision is, however, receiving much disapproval by several religious and human rights groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anencephaly in Brazil: A New Decision, Old Issues|url=http://www.genderacrossborders.com/2012/04/13/25308|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Legal proceedings ===

The case of baby Theresa was the beginning of the ethical debate over anencephalic infant organ donation.<ref name="Bard"/> The story of baby Theresa remains a focus of basic moral philosophy. Baby Theresa was born with anencephaly in 1992. Her parents, knowing that their child was going to die, requested that her organs be given for transplantation. Although her physicians agreed, Florida law prohibited the infant's organs from being removed while she was still alive. By the time she died nine days after birth, her organs had deteriorated past the point of being viable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rachels|first=James|title=What is Morality|url=http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Intro_Philosophy_SP_2011/Rachels_Ch_One.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>

[[Baby K]] was an anenecephalic infant that was kept alive for two years and 174 days under intensive care by order of the [[US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]].

==== United States Uniform Acts ====
The Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) is a model bill, adopted by many US states, stating that an individual who has sustained either 1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or 2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. This bill was a result of much debate over the definition of death and is applicable to the debate over anencephaly.  A related bill, the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (UAGA), grants individuals and, after death, their family members the right to decide whether or not to donate organs.  Because it is against the law for any person to pay money for an organ, the person in need of an organ transplant must rely on a volunteer.<ref name="Meinke"/>

There have been two state bills that proposed to change current laws regarding death and organ donation. California Senate Bill 2019 proposed to amend the UDDA to define anencephalic infants as already dead, while New Jersey Assembly Bill 3367 proposed to allow anencephalic infants to be organ sources even if they are not dead.<ref name="Meinke"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Uniform Declaration of Death Act (UDDA)|url=http://www.ascensionhealth.org/index.php?option=com_content|accessdate=19 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

==Research ==

Some genetic research has been conducted to determine the causes of anencephaly. It has been found that cartilage homeoprotein (CART1) is selectively expressed in [[chondrocytes]] (cartilage cells).  The CART1 gene to chromosome 12q21.3–q22 has been mapped. Also, it has been found that mice homozygous for deficiency in the Cart1 gene manifested acrania and meroanencephaly, and prenatal treatment with [[folic acid]] will suppress [[acrania]] and meroanencephaly in the Cart1-deficient mutants.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1028-4559(08)60070-4 |title=Syndromes, Disorders and Maternal Risk Factors Associated with Neural Tube Defects (III) |year=2008 |last1=Chen |first1=Chih-Ping |journal=Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=131–40 |pmid=18603496}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng0796-275 |title=Prenatal folic acid treatment suppresses acrania and meroanencephaly in mice mutant for the Cart1 homeobox gene |year=1996 |last1=Zhao |first1=Qi|last2=Behringer |first2=Richard R. |last3=De Crombrugghe |first3=Benoit |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=13 |issue=3|pages=275–83 |pmid=8673125}}</ref>
