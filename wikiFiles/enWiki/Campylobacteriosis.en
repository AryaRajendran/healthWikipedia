'''Campylobacteriosis''' is an [[infection]] by the ''[[Campylobacter]]'' [[bacterium]],<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/campylobacter/ cdc.gov] Centers for disease Control and Prevention</ref> most commonly ''[[C. jejuni]]''. It is among the most common [[List of infectious diseases|bacterial infections]] of [[human]]s, often a [[foodborne illness]]. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, [[diarrhea]] or [[dysentery]] syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever and pain.

==Cause==
{{Main|Campylobacter}}

[[File:Campylobacter.jpg|thumb|250px|Campylobacter bacteria are the number-one cause of food-related  [[gastrointestinal]] illness in the United States. This scanning electron microscope image shows the characteristic spiral, or corkscrew, shape of ''[[Campylobacter jejuni|C. jejuni]]'' cells and related structures.]]
Campylobacteriosis is caused by ''Campylobacter'' bacteria (curved or spiral, motile, non–spore-forming, [[Gram-negative]] rods). The disease is usually caused by ''[[C. jejuni]]'', a spiral and comma shaped bacterium normally found in cattle, swine, and birds, where it is nonpathogenic, but the illness can also be caused by ''[[Campylobacter coli|C. coli]]'' (also found in cattle, swine, and birds), ''[[Campylobacter upsaliensis|C. upsaliensis]]'' (found in cats and dogs) and ''[[Campylobacter lari|C. lari]]'' (present in seabirds in particular).

One effect of campylobacteriosis is tissue injury in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]]. The sites of tissue injury include the [[jejunum]], the [[ileum]], and the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. ''C jejuni'' appears to achieve this by invading and destroying epithelial cells.

''C. jejuni'' can also cause a latent autoimmune effect on the nerves of the legs, which is usually seen several weeks after a surgical procedure of the adomen. The effect is known as an acute idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), i.e. [[Guillain-Barre syndrome]], in which one sees symptoms of ascending paralysis, dysaesthesias usually below the waist, and, in the later stages, respiratory failure.

Some strains of ''C jejuni'' produce a [[cholera]]-like enterotoxin, which is important in the watery diarrhea observed in infections. The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative enteritis. In a small number of cases, the infection may be associated with [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] through a poorly understood mechanism.

==Transmission==
The common [[routes of transmission]] for the disease-causing bacteria are fecal-oral, person-to-person sexual contact, ingestion of contaminated food (generally unpasteurized (raw) [[milk]] and undercooked or poorly handled [[poultry]]), and waterborne (i.e., through contaminated [[drinking water]]). Contact with contaminated poultry, livestock, or household pets, especially puppies, can also cause disease.<ref name=Saenz_2000>{{cite journal | author=Saenz Y, Zarazaga M, Lantero M, Gastanares MJ, Baquero F, Torres C | title=Antibiotic resistance in ''Campylobacter'' strains isolated from animals, foods, and humans in Spain in 1997-1998 | journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother | year=2000 | pages=267–71 | volume=44 | issue=2 | pmid=10639348 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/44/2/267 | doi=10.1128/AAC.44.2.267-271.2000 | pmc=89669}}</ref>

Animals farmed for meat are the main source of campylobacteriosis. A study published in PLoS Genetics (September 26, 2008) by researchers from Lancashire, England, and Chicago, IL, found that 97 percent of campylobacteriosis cases sampled in Lancashire were caused by bacteria typically found in chicken and livestock. In 57 percent of cases, the bacteria could be traced to chicken, and in 35 percent to cattle. Wild animal and environmental sources were accountable for just three percent of disease.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/544581/ Animals Farmed for Meat Are the Number 1 Source of Food Poisoning Bug] Newswise, Retrieved on September 23, 2008.</ref><ref name=Wilson_2008>{{cite journal | author=Wilson DJ, Gabriel E, Leatherbarrow AJH, Cheesbrough J, Gee S, Bolton E, Fox A, Fearnhead P, Hart CA, Diggle PJ | title=Tracing the source of campylobacteriosis | journal=PLoS Genet | year=2008 | pages=e1000203 | volume=4 | issue=9 | url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000203 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000203 }}</ref>

The infectious dose is 1000-10,000 bacteria (although ten to five hundred bacteria can be enough to infect humans). ''Campylobacter'' species are sensitive to [[hydrochloric acid]] in the [[stomach]], and acid reduction treatment can reduce the amount of [[inoculum]] needed to cause disease.

Exposure to bacteria is often more common during travelling, and therefore campylobacteriosis is a common form of [[travelers' diarrhea]].

==Epidemiology==
''Campylobacter'' one of the most common causes of human bacterial [[gastroenteritis]].<ref>Moore, 2005</ref> For instance, an estimated 2 million cases of ''[[Campylobacter]]'' [[enteritis]] occur annually in the [[United States|U.S.]], accounting for 5-7% of cases of [[gastroenteritis]]. Furthermore, in the [[United Kingdom]] during 2000, ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' was involved in 77.3% in all cases of [[foodborne illness]].<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/science/sciencetopics/microbiology/58736 Food Standards Agency]</ref> About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with campylobacteriosis every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor ''Campylobacter'' in their gut.

A large animal reservoir is present as well, with up to 100% of poultry, including [[chicken]]s, [[turkey]]s, and waterfowl, having asymptomatic infections in their intestinal tracts. Infected [[chicken]] feces may contain up to 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria per 25&nbsp;grams, and due to the installations, the bacteria are rapidly spread to other [[chicken]]s. This vastly exceeds the infectious dose of 1000-10,000 bacteria for humans.

In January 2013, the [[UK]]'s [[Food Standards Agency]] warned that two-thirds of all raw chicken bought from UK shops was contaminated with campylobacter, affecting an estimated half a million people annually and killing approximately 100.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9820838/FSA-warns-that-chicken-bacteria-could-be-next-meat-scandal.html</ref>

==Symptoms==
The [[prodrome]] is fever, headache, and myalgias, lasting as long as 24 hours. The actual [[latent period]] is 2–5 days (sometimes 1–6 days). In other words, it typically takes 1–2 days until actual symptoms develop.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} These are [[diarrhea]] (as many as 10 watery, frequently bloody, bowel movements per day) or [[dysentery]], [[cramps]], [[abdominal pain]], and [[fever]] as high as 40°C (104°F). In most people, the illness lasts for 2–10 days. This is classified as invasive/inflammatory diarrhea, also known as bloody diarrhea or dysentery.

Symptoms may also depend on [[route of transmission]]. In participants of unprotected anal intercourse, campylobacteriosis is more localized to the distal end of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and may be termed a [[proctocolitis]].

There are other diseases showing similar symptoms. For instance, abdominal pain and tenderness may be very localized, mimicking [[acute appendicitis]]. Furthermore, ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' is closely related to [[Campylobacter]] and causes [[peptic ulcer disease]].

===Other factors===
In patients with [[HIV]], infections may be more frequent, may cause prolonged bouts of dirty brown diarrhea, and may be more commonly associated with [[bacteremia]] and antibiotic resistance. The severity and persistence of infection in patients with AIDS and [[hypogammaglobulinemia]] indicates that both cell-mediated and humoral immunity are important in preventing and terminating infection.

==Diagnosis==
''Campylobacter'' organisms can be detected by performing a Gram stain of a stool sample with high [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] and a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of ~60%, but are most often diagnosed by stool culture. Fecal [[leukocytes]] should be present and indicate the diarrhea to be inflammatory in nature. Methods currently being developed to detect the presence of campylobacter organisms include antigen testing via an [[ELISA|EIA]] or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].

==Treatment==
The infection is usually self-limiting, and in most cases, symptomatic treatment by liquid and [[Electrolyte#Nutritional significance|electrolyte replacement]] is enough in human infections.<ref>Sherris</ref>

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment is controversial, and has only a marginal benefit (1.32 days) on the duration of symptoms, and should not be used routinely.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ternhag A, Asikainen T, Giesecke J, Ekdahl K | title=A meta-analysis on the effects of antibiotic treatment on duration of symptoms caused by infection with Campylobacter species | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2007 | volume=44 | pages=696&ndash;700  | doi=10.1086/509924 | pmid=17278062 | issue=5}}</ref>

[[Erythromycin]] can be used in children, and [[tetracycline]] in adults. Some studies show, however, that [[erythromycin]] rapidly eliminates ''Campylobacter'' from the stool without affecting the duration of illness. Nevertheless, children with [[dysentery]] due to ''[[C. jejuni]]'' benefit from early treatment with erythromycin. Treatment with antibiotics, therefore, depends on the severity of symptoms. [[Quinolone]]s are effective if the organism is sensitive, but high rates of quinolone use in livestock means that quinolones are now largely ineffective.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fàbrega A, Sánchez-Céspedes J, Soto S, Vila J|title=Quinolone resistance in the food chain|journal=Int J Antimicrob Agents|year=2008|volume=31|issue=4|pages=307&ndash;15|pmid=18308515|doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.12.010}}</ref>

Antimotility agents, such as [[loperamide]], can lead to prolonged illness or intestinal perforation in any invasive diarrhea, and should be avoided.  [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] and [[ampicillin]] are ineffective against ''Campylobacter''.

===In animals===
In the past, poultry infections were often treated by mass administration of [[enrofloxacin]] and [[sarafloxacin]] for single instances of infection. The FDA banned this practice, as it promoted the development of [[fluoroquinolone]]-resistant populations.<ref name=McDermott_2002>{{cite journal |author=McDermott P, Bodeis S, English L, White D, Walker R, Zhao S, Simjee S, Wagner D |title=Ciprofloxacin resistance in Campylobacter jejuni evolves rapidly in chickens treated with fluoroquinolones |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=185 |issue=6 |pages=837–40 |year=2002 |pmid=11920303 |doi=10.1086/339195}}</ref>
A major broad-spectrum [[fluoroquinolone]] used in humans is [[ciprofloxacin]].

Currently growing resistance of the ''Campylobacter'' to fluoroquinolones and [[macrolide]]s is of a major concern.

==Prognosis==
Campylobacteriosis is usually self-limited without any mortality (assuming proper hydration is maintained). However, there are several possible complications.

===Complications===
Complications include [[toxic megacolon]], [[dehydration]] and [[sepsis]]. Such complications generally occur in young children (< 1 year of age) and immunocompromised people. A chronic course of the disease is possible; this disease process is likely to develop without a distinct acute phase. Chronic campylobacteriosis features a long period of sub-[[febrile]] temperature and [[asthenia]]; eye damage, [[arthritis]], [[endocarditis]] may develop if infection is untreated.

Occasional deaths occur in young, previously healthy individuals because of blood volume depletion (due to dehydration), and in persons who are elderly or immunocompromised.

Some individuals (1-2 in 100,000 cases) develop [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], in which the nerves that join the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body are damaged, sometimes permanently. This occurs only with infection of ''C. jejuni'' and ''C. upsaliensis''.<ref>Medical microbiology,Murray, P.R. and others. 2002 Mosby St. Louis</ref>

==Prevention==
*Pasteurization of milk and chlorination of drinking water destroy the organism.
*Treatment with antibiotics can reduce fecal excretion.
*Infected health care workers should not provide direct patient care.
*Separate cutting boards should be used for foods of animal origin and other foods. After preparing raw food of animal origin, all cutting boards and countertops should be carefully cleaned with soap and hot water.
*Contact with pet saliva and feces should be avoided.

Following are recommendations of the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allcountries.org/health/campylobacter.html |title=Campylobacter |work=Health Topics A TO Z |accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref>
;Recommendations for the public and travellers
:Your food should be properly cooked and hot when served.
:Consume only pasteurized or boiled milk and milk products, never raw milk products.
: Make sure that ice is from safe water.
: If you are not sure of the safety of drinking water, boil it, or disinfect it with chemical disinfectant.
: Wash hands thoroughly and frequently with soap, especially after using the toilet and after contact with pets and farm animals.
: Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially if they are to be eaten raw. Peel fruits and vegetables whenever possible.
;Recommendations for food handlers
: Food handlers, professionals and at home, should observe hygienic rules during food preparation.
: Professional food handlers should immediately report to their employer any fever, diarrhea, vomiting or visible infected skin lesions.
