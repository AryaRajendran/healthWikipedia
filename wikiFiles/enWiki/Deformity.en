A '''deformity''', '''dysmorphism''', or '''dysmorphic feature''' is a major difference in the shape of a body part or organ compared to the average shape of that part.
==Causes==
Deformity may arise from numerous causes:
*Genetic [[mutation]]
*Damage to the [[fetus]] or [[uterus]]
*Complications at [[childbirth|birth]]
*A growth or hormone disorder
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury e.g. [[Third degree burn|burn injury]].
*[[Arthritis]] and other rheumatoid disorders

Deformity can occur in non-humans, as well.  [[Frogs]] can be mutated due to [[Ribeiroia]] ([[Trematoda]]) infection.

==Mortality==
In many cases in which a major deformity is present at birth, it is the result of an underlying condition severe enough that the baby does not survive very long. The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs, structural defects that prevent breathing or eating, and high susceptibility to injuries, abnormal facial appearance, or infections that lead to death.

==In mythology==
[[Mythological]] creatures may have been created due to a deformative syndrome also, for instance, descriptions of [[mermaid]]s may be related to the symptoms of [[sirenomelia]]. The [[Irish Mythology]] includes the [[Fomorians]], who are almost without exception described as being deformed, possessing only one of what most have two of ([[human eye|eye]]s, [[arm]]s, [[Human leg|leg]]s, etc.) or having larger than normal limbs.
