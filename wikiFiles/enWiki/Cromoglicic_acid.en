'''Cromoglicic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (also referred to as '''cromolyn''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), '''cromoglycate''' (former [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), or '''cromoglicate''') is traditionally described as a [[mast cell stabilizer]], and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt '''sodium cromoglicate''' or '''cromolyn sodium'''.  This drug prevents the release of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] chemicals such as [[histamine]] from [[mast cell]]s.

Because of their convenience (and perceived safety), [[leukotriene antagonist|leukotriene receptor antagonist]]s have largely replaced it as the non-[[corticosteroid]] treatment of choice in the treatment of [[asthma]]. Cromoglicic acid requires administration four times daily, and does not provide additive benefit in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fanta CH |title=Asthma |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=360 |issue=10 |pages=1002–14 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19264689 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0804579}} Review.</ref>

==History==
Cromolyn sodium was discovered by [[Roger Altounyan]] who was himself a lifelong asthma sufferer. It is considered a breakthrough drug in management of asthma as the patients can be freed from steroids in many cases, however, it is mainly effective as a prophylaxis for allergic and exercise induced asthma, not as a treatment for acute attacks.  Altounyan was investigating certain plants and herbs which have bronchodilating properties. One such plant was [[Khella]] (''Ammi visnaga'') which had been used as a muscle relaxant since ancient times in Egypt. Altounyan deliberately inhaled derivatives of the active ingredient [[khellin]] to determine if they could block his asthma attacks. After several years of trial he isolated an effective and safe asthma-preventing compound called cromolyn sodium.

==Preparations==
Cromoglicic acid is available in multiple forms:

* as a [[nasal spray]] (Rynacrom(UK), Nasalcrom, Prevalin (Netherlands)) to treat [[allergic rhinitis]].

* in a nebulizer solution for aerosol administration to treat [[asthma]].

* as an [[inhaler]] (Intal) for preventive management of [[asthma]].<ref name="pmid8635375">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz HJ, Blumenthal M, Brady R, ''et al.'' |title=A comparative study of the clinical efficacy of nedocromil sodium and placebo.

Another oral product, Intercron (sodium cromoglicate in distilled water, from [[Zambon]] France), is used for food allergies.

==Mechanism of action==
"Cromolyn works because it prevents the release of mediators that would normally attract inflammatory cells and because it stabilizes the inflammatory cells."<ref>Werner's Pathophysiology page 224</ref>  [[Nedocromil]] is another mast cell stabilizer that also works in controlling asthma.
The underlying [[mechanism of action]] is not fully understood; for while cromoglicate stabilizes mast cells, this mechanism is probably not why it works in asthma.<ref name="rang">H. P. Rang et al., ''Pharmacology'', Fifth Edition. (2003) ISBN 0-443-07145-4</ref>  Pharmaceutical companies have produced 20 related compounds that are equally or more potent at stabilising mast cells and none of them have shown any anti-asthmatic effect.<ref name="rang"/> It is more likely that these work by inhibiting the response of sensory [[C fibers]] to the irritant [[capsaicin]], inhibiting local axon reflexes involved in asthma, and may inhibit the release of preformed T cell cytokines and mediators involved in asthma. (see review by Garland, 1991)

It is known to somewhat inhibit [[chloride channels]] (37% +/- 7%) <ref>{{cite journal

 }}</ref> and thus ''may'' inhibit the:
* exaggerated neuronal reflexes triggered by stimulation of irritant receptors on sensory nerve endings (e.g. exercise-induced asthma)
* release of preformed [[cytokines]] from several type of inflammatory cells ([[T cell]]s, [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]]) in allergen-induced asthma

Note: Another chemical (NPPB: 5-nitro-2(3-phenyl) propylamino-benzoic acid) was shown, in the same study, to be a more effective chloride channel blocker.

Finally it may act by inhibiting calcium influx.<!-- see DrugBank link above-->

Cromoglicate is classified as a [[chromone]].
