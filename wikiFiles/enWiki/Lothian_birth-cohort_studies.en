'''The Lothian birth-cohort studies'''<ref>Deary, I. J., Gow, A. J., Pattie, A., & Starr, J. M. (2011). Cohort Profile: The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936. International Journal of Epidemiology. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyr197</ref> comprise three [[Cohort (statistics)|Cohort]] studies, combining research into [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]] and [[geriatrics]].

==Lothian Birth Cohort Study 1921==
The original '''Lothian Birth Cohort Study 1921'''  investigated childhood [[intelligence]], measured at age 11, and health outcomes in old age. The study comprises a [[cohort]] of 551 adults born in the [[Lothian]] region of [[Scotland]] in 1921. Publications from the study have contributed to the new field of [[cognitive epidemiology]]. One important finding from the LBC1921 study was that children with higher [[IQ]] scores at age 11 were not relatively better protected against cognitive decline in later life. Instead, they had better cogntitive ability in old age because of the high stability of [[intelligence]] across the lifespan.<ref name="Gow 2010">{{Cite journal |author=Gow, A.J. et al. |authorlink=Alan Gow |year=2010 |title=

==Lothian Birth Cohort Study 1936==
The '''Lothian Birth Cohort Study 1936''' is a similar cohort to the 1921 study, but involves 1091 participants who were born in 1936.<ref name="Deary 2007">{{Cite journal |author=Deary, I.J. et al. |authorlink=Ian Deary |year=2007 |title=

==The 6-day sample==
1,208 people born during the first day of alternative months in 1936 (i.e. February, April, June, August, October and December) took additional intelligence tests, and provided detailed information about the home environment. This additional data was collected annually for the following 16 years, and included home visits by a researcher.<ref name="Deary 2004">{{Cite journal |author=Deary, I.J. et al. |authorlink=Ian Deary |year=2004 |title=The impact of childhood intelligence on later life: Following up the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947 |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=130–147 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.130}}</ref><ref>Maxwell, James.

==Aims and objectives==
The Lothian Birth Cohort Studies can provide information about the determinants of cognitive decline, because they have available a measure of premorbid intelligence measured at age 11. They can also be used to provide information about health inequalities in old age, taking childhood factors into consideration.

==Funding==

The LBC1921 study was funded by Several UK research funding councils and other agencies. The LBC1936 study is funded by [[Age UK]] and [[Help the Aged]], latterly as part of the Disconnected Mind project.

==Direction==

Professor [[Ian Deary]] of the Department of Psychology at [[University of Edinburgh]] directs the Lothian Birth Cohort Studies.
