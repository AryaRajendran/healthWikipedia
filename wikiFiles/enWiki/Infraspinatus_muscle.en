In human anatomy, the '''infraspinatus muscle''' is a thick triangular [[muscle]], which occupies the chief part of the [[infraspinatous fossa]].<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', see infobox.</ref>  As one of the four muscles of the [[rotator cuff]], the main function of the infraspinatus is to externally rotate the arm and stabilize the shoulder joint.

==Human anatomy==

===Origin and insertion===
It attaches medially to the [[infraspinous fossa]] of the [[scapula]] and laterally to the middle facet of the [[greater tubercle]] of the [[humerus]].

The muscle arises by fleshy fibers from the medial two-thirds of the infraspinatous fossa, and by tendinous fibers from the ridges on its surface; it also arises from the [[infraspinatous fascia]] which covers it, and separates it from the [[teres major]] and [[teres minor]].<ref name="Gray's" />

The fibers converge to a tendon, which glides over the lateral border of the spine of the scapula, and, passing across the posterior part of the capsule of the shoulder-joint, is inserted into the middle impression on the [[greater tubercle]] of the [[humerus]].<ref name="Gray's" />
The trapezoidal insertion of the infraspinatus onto the humerus is much larger than the equivalent insertion of the supraspinatus, the reason why the infraspinatus is involved in rotarcuff tears about as frequently as the supraspinatus.

===Relations===
The tendon of this muscle is sometimes separated from the capsule of the [[shoulder-joint]] by a [[Bursa (anatomy)|bursa]], which may communicate with the joint cavity.<ref name="Gray's" />

===Innervation===
The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles. These muscles function to abduct and laterally rotate the arm, respectively.

===Action===
The primary functions of the infraspinatus are extension, horizontal (transverse) extension and external rotation of humerus at the shoulder joint.  It is the major external rotator of the shoulder.  When the arm is fixed, it abducts the inferior angle of the scapula. Its synergists are teres minor, subscapularis, and the deltoid.<ref>{{cite web

The infraspinatus and teres minor rotate the [[head of the humerus]] outward (external, or lateral, rotation); they also assist in carrying the arm backward (extension of the glenohumeral joint).<ref name="Gray's" />

Additionally, the infraspinatus reinforces the capsule of the shoulder joint.<ref name="Platzer-2004">{{cite book | ref = harv

===Variation===
The infraspinatus is frequently fused with the teres minor.<ref name="Platzer-2004" />

==Evolutionary variation==
The pectoral muscles&nbsp;— the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] and [[Pectoralis minor muscle|pectoralis minor]]&nbsp;— evolved from a primitive muscle sheet that connected the [[Coracoid process|coracoid]] to the [[humerus]].  In late reptilians and early mammals, this muscle structure was displaced dorsally; while most of its components evolved into the pectoralis major, some fibers eventually attached to the scapula and evolved into the supraspinatus, the infraspinatus, and parts of the subscapularis.
