'''Menorrhagia''' is an abnormally heavy and prolonged [[menstruation|menstrual period]] at regular intervals. Menorrhagia can be caused by abnormal blood clotting, disruption of normal hormonal regulation of periods, or disorders of the [[endometrium|endometrial]] lining of the [[uterus]]. Depending upon the cause, it may be associated with abnormally painful periods ([[dysmenorrhea]]).

==Definition==
A normal menstrual cycle is 25–35 days in duration, with bleeding lasting an average of 5 days and total blood flow between 25 and 80 mL.  A blood loss of greater than 80 ml or lasting longer than 7 days constitutes menorrhagia (also called hypermenorrhea). Some authors use menorrhagia exclusively when describing excessive quantity and hypermenorrhea for prolonged duration (although most use both terms interchangeably in the clinical setting).  In practice this is not usually directly measured by patients or doctors.  Menorrhagia also occurs at predictable and normal (usually about 28 days) intervals, distinguishing it from [[menometrorrhagia]], which occurs at irregular and more frequent intervals. It is possible to estimate the amount of bleeding by the number of tampons or pads a woman uses during her period. As a guide a regular tampon fully soaked will hold about 5ml of blood. One may also have lighter cycles in volume, but blood flow may continue more than seven days thus constituting menorrhagia. An OB/GYN should still be consulted.

==Cause==
Usually no causative abnormality can be identified and treatment is directed at the symptom, rather than a specific mechanism. Most common cause include blood disorder or stress-related disorders. A brief overview of causes is given below, followed by a more formal medical list based on the nature of the menstrual cycle experienced.
 
===Disorders of coagulation===
With the shedding of an endometrial lining's blood vessels, normal [[coagulation]] process must occur to limit and eventually stop the blood flow.  Blood disorders of [[platelets]] (such as [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|ITP]]) or [[coagulation]] (such as [[von Willebrand disease]]) or use of [[anticoagulant]] medication (such as [[warfarin]]) are therefore possible causes, although a rare minority of cases. Platelet function studies pfa col/epi can also be used to ascertain platelet function abnormalities

===Excessive build up in endometrial lining===
Periods soon after the onset of menstruation in girls (the [[menarche]]) and just before [[menopause]] may in some women be particularly heavy.  Hormonal disorders involving the ovaries-pituitary-hypothalamus (the 'ovarian endocrine axis') account for many cases, and hormonal-based treatments may regulate effectively.  

The lining of the uterus builds up naturally under the hormonal effects of pregnancy, and an early  spontaneous [[miscarriage]] may be mistaken for a heavier than normal period. 

As women age and move towards menopause, ovulation is delayed and the remaining follicles in the ovaries become resistant to GnRH (Gonadotropin releasing hormone) secreted by the [[hypothalamus]] gland in the brain. Either that or they don't develop an egg, and thus no [[progesterone]] is produced. Without progesterone, the estrogen is "unopposed" and keeps building up the lining of the uterus. 

During a woman's period, the endometrial lining which is normally shed never gets the signal to stop thickening. It keeps growing and sheds irregularly. Due to the extra thickness, the bleeding is unusually heavy. Less frequently in this age group, too little estrogen causes the irregular bleeding. Most cases of hemorrhagic are due to normal hormonal changes preceding menopause.

Irritation of the endometrium may result in increased blood flow, e.g. from infection (acute or chronic [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]) or the contraceptive [[intrauterine device]] (note the distinction from the [[IntraUterine System]] which is used to treat this condition).

[[Uterine fibroids|Fibroids]] in the wall of the uterus sometimes can cause increased menstrual loss if they protrude into the central cavity and thereby increase endometrium's surface area.

Abnormalities of the endometrium such as [[adenomyosis]] (so called "internal endometriosis") where there is extension into the wall of the uterus gives rise to an enlarged tender uterus. Note, true [[endometriosis]] is a cause of pain ([[dysmenorrhoea]]) but usually not alteration in menstrual blood loss.

[[Endometrial carcinoma]] (cancer of the uterine lining) usually causes irregular bleeding, rather than the cyclical pattern of menorrhagia.  Bleeding in between periods (''intermenstrual bleeding'' or '''IMB''') or after the menopause ([[post-menopausal bleeding]] or '''PMB''') should always be considered suspicious.

===Consideration by nature of the menstrual cycle===
*Excessive menses but normal cycle:
**Painless:
***[[Fibroids]] ( leiomyoma )
***Ovarian endocrine disorder ([[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] or '''DUB''')(the most common cause)
***Coagulation defects (rare)
***[[endometrial cancer]]
***[[endometrial polyp]]
**Painful:
***[[Pelvic inflammatory disease]]
***[[Endometriosis]]
***[[Adenomyosis]]
*Short cycle (<21 days) but normal menses ([[epimenorrhoea]] or [[polymenorrhoea]]).  These are always [[anovulatory cycle]]s due to hormonal disorders.
*Short cycle and excessive menses ([[epimenorrhagia]]) due to ovarian dysfunction and may be secondary to blockage of blood vessels by tumours.
*Excessive menses and long intervals.
**Anovular ovarian disorder due to prolonged estrogen production.
**This may occur following prolonged continuous courses of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] (e.g. where several packets are taken without a withdrawal gap in order to defer menstruation).

===Differential Diagnosis===
* Pregnancy complications:
** [[Ectopic pregnancy]]
** Incomplete abortion
** [[Miscarriage]]
** Threatened abortion
* Nonuterine bleeding:
** Cervical ectropion/erosion
** Cervical neoplasia/polyp
** Cervical or vaginal trauma
** Condylomata
** Atrophic vaginitis
** Foreign bodies
* Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):
** Endometritis
** Tuberculosis
*[[Hypothyroidism]]

===Risk Factors===
* Obesity 
* Anovulation
* Estrogen administration (without progestogens)
* Prior treatment with progestational agents or oral contraceptives increases the risk of endometrial atrophy, but decreases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or neoplasia

==Diagnosis==
* Pelvic and rectal examination
* Pap smear
* Pelvic ultrasound scan is the first line diagnostic tool for identifying structural abnormalities.{{ref|NICE44-2007}} 
* Endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia
* [[Hysteroscopy]]

==Treatment==
Where an underlying cause can be identified, treatment may be directed at this. Clearly heavy periods at [[menarche]] and [[menopause]] may settle spontaneously (the menarche being the start and menopause being the cessation of periods).

If the degree of bleeding is mild, all that may be sought by the woman is the reassurance that there is no sinister underlying cause. If anemia occurs then [[iron]] tablets may be used to help restore normal [[hemoglobin]] levels.

The condition is often treated with hormones, particularly as dysfunctional uterine bleeding commonly occurs in the early and late menstrual years when contraception is also sought. Usually, oral [[Contraception|combined contraceptive]] or [[progesterone only pill|progesterone only]] pills may be taken for a few months, but for longer-term treatment the alternatives of injected [[Depo Provera]] or the more recent [[progesterone]] releasing [[IntraUterine System]] (IUS) may be used. Fibroids may respond to hormonal treatment, and if they do not, then surgical removal may be required.

This may be combined with hormonal medication previously mentioned. [[Anti-inflammatory]] medication like [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|NSAID]]s may also been used, but typically cause only a 30%{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} reduction in flow. 

A definitive treatment for menorrhagia is to perform [[hysterectomy]] (removal of the uterus). The risks of the procedure have been reduced with measures to reduce the risk of [[deep vein thrombosis]] after surgery, and the switch from the front abdominal to vaginal approach greatly minimizing the discomfort and recuperation time for the patient; however extensive fibroids may make the womb too large for removal by the vaginal approach.  Small fibroids may be dealt with by local removal ([[myomectomy]]).  A further surgical technique is [[endometrial ablation]] (destruction) by the use of applied heat ([[thermoablation]]). 

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the use of hysterectomy for menorrhagia has been almost halved between 1989 and 2003{{ref|BMJ2005}}. This has a number of causes: better medical management, endometrial ablation and particularly the introduction of IUS{{ref|JAMA-5yr}}{{ref|FertSteril}} which may be inserted in the community and avoid the need for specialist referral; in one study up to 64% of women cancelled surgery{{ref|BJOG}}.

===Medications===
These have been ranked by the UK's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]:{{ref_label|NICE44-2007|1|a}}
* First line
** [[IntraUterine System]] insertion
*Second Line
** [[Tranexamic acid]] an antifibrinolytic agent 
** [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) 
** [[Combined oral contraceptive pill]]s to prevent proliferation of the endometrium
*Third line
** Oral progestogen (e.g. [[norethisterone]]), to prevent proliferation of the endometrium
** Injected progestogen (e.g. [[Depo provera]])
*Other options
** Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (e.g. [[Goserelin]])

===Surgery===
* Dilation and curettage (D&C) is no longer performed for cases of simple menorrhagia, having a reserved role if a spontaneous abortion is incomplete
* [[Endometrial ablation]]
* [[Uterine artery]] [[embolisation]] (UAE)
* Hysteroscopic [[myomectomy]] to remove fibroids over 3&nbsp;cm in diameter

==Complications==
Aside from the social distress of dealing with a prolonged and heavy period, over time the blood loss may prove to be greater than the body iron reserves or the rate of blood replenishment, leading to [[anemia]].  Symptoms attributable to the anemia may include shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness, tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, headaches, depression, becoming cold more easily, and poor concentration.
