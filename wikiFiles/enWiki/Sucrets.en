==History==
The product was introduced in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] by [[Sharp & Dohme]] in 1932.<ref name=tin/>

In 1966 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] ordered [[Merck and Company]] to discontinue the [[false claim]]s of germ-killing and pain-relieving properties for its Sucrets and Children's Sucrets throat lozenges.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=F.T.C.

SmithKline Beecham, after announcing a merger with GlaxoWellcome to form [[GlaxoSmithKline]], sold the brand in 2000 to [[Insight Pharmaceuticals]]. In 2011, Sucrets reintroduced their product back into the familiar tin due to popular demand and nostalgia.
