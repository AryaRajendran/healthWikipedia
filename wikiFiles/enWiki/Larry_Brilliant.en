From 1973 to 1976, he participated in the successful [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[smallpox]] eradication program.  In April 2009, he was chosen to oversee the "Skoll Global Threats Fund" established by eBay co-founder [[Jeff Skoll]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Google.org director to head 'threats' fund|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/former-googleorg-director-head-urgent/story.aspx?guid={D338D007-D2E1-4D80-9E2A-486C2BF6FEE1}&dist=msr_1}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born in [[Detroit, Michigan]] (May 5, 1944), he received his undergraduate training as well as his MPH degree (Masters in Public Health) from the [[University of Michigan]], where he worked on the staff of the [[Gargoyle Humor Magazine]], and his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]]. He moved to [[California]] for his [[internship]] at the [[California Pacific Medical Center]], and developed [[thyroid cancer]] from which he recovered. Brilliant is board certified in preventive medicine and public health.

In 1969, a group of American Indians from many different tribes, calling themselves Indians of All Tribes, [[Occupation of Alcatraz|occupied the Alcatraz island]] in San Francisco.  A call went out for doctors to help a pregnant woman there give birth and Brilliant joined their occupation as unofficial doctor.<ref name="mindfully">{{cite web |date=24February2006| url = http://www.mindfully.org/Technology/2006/Larry-Brilliant-Technology24feb06.htm| title = Larry Brilliant: Doctor Looks to Use Technology to Aid Global Health Care| publisher = Wall Street Journal| accessdate = 2007-07-26 | author=Hoge, Patrick}}</ref>

==Career==
After the US government forced the Indians of All Tribes off Alcatraz, Brilliant became a media darling which led to a movie company casting him in ''Medicine Ball Caravan''—a sequel to the hit [[Woodstock Nation]]—playing a doctor in a film about a tribe of hippies who follow the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Joni Mitchell]].<ref name="fastcompany">{{cite web |year=2000 | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/online/39/brilliant.html| title = Dr. Brilliant Vs. the Devil of Ambition| publisher = fastcompany.com| accessdate = 2007-07-26 | last=Harriet Rubin  }}</ref>  The cast was paid with airline tickets to [[India]]. Brilliant and some others cashed their tickets in and rented a bus to drive around Europe, which then turned into a relief convoy to help victims of the [[1970 Bhola cyclone|1970 Bhola cyclone in Bangladesh]] (then East Pakistan).

Civil unrest stopped the relief caravan so he spent several years in India studying at a [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[ashram]] with [[Neem Karoli Baba]] (a [[Hindu]] sage) from whom he received the name Subramanyum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramdass.org/RD/a-walk-around-the-lake/ |title=A Walk Around the Lake |first=Larry |last=Brilliant |work=Ram Dass: Love Serve Remember Foundation |date=March 20, 2013}} Excerpted from Ram Dass (1978), ''Miracle of Love: Stories about Neem Karoli Baba''.  ISBN 0-525-47611-3
</ref> After about a year [[Neem Karoli Baba]] told Brilliant to eradicate [[smallpox]] on which he would spend the next several years.  He participated, as a medical officer, in the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[smallpox]] eradication program that in 1980 certified the global eradication of smallpox.<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |year=2000 | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/| title = Smallpox | accessdate = 2007-07-26 | publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] }}</ref>

In December 1978, he became a co-founder and chairman of [[Seva Foundation]], an international, non-profit, health foundation. Seva's projects in places like [[Tibet]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Guatemala]] have given back sight to more than 3 million blind people through surgery, self-sufficient eye care systems, and low cost manufacturing of [[intraocular lense]]s. One important contribution of his was his helping to set up the [[Aravind Eye Hospital]] in [[Madurai]], India.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

When he returned to the United States, he became a professor of international health at the [[University of Michigan]] as well as starting numerous charitable and business ventures.
