==Diseases included in this category==

The list of these diseases depends of the author, but usually are included:

* Standard [[multiple sclerosis]], the most known and extended variant.
* [[Optic-spinal MS]], or '''Opticospinal''', variant which often include visual symptoms and have a more severe course than typical MS. Though multiple scars (scleroses) are present in CNS, and sometimes [[Poser criteria]] classifies it as clinically definite multiple sclerosis,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kalanie H, Kholghie Y, Shamsai GR, Ghorbani M |title=Opticospinal multiple sclerosis in Iran |journal=J Neurol Sci. |year=2008 |month= October|pmid=18962726 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2008.09.038 |volume=276 |issue=1-2 |pages=130–2 }}</ref> currently is considered outside the scope of Multiple Sclerosis and inside the scope of [[Devic's disease]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kira J |title=Neuromyelitis optica and asian phenotype of multiple sclerosis |journal=Ann NY Acad Sci. |volume=1142 |issue= 1|pages=58–71 |year=2008 |month= October|pmid=18990121 |doi=10.1196/annals.1444.002 }}</ref> though is not sure if this applies to all cases.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matsushita | first1 = T | last2 = Isobe | first2 = N | last3 = Matsuoka | first3 = T | last4 = Shi | first4 = N | last5 = Kawano | first5 = Y | last6 = Wu | first6 = XM | last7 = Yoshiura | first7 = T | last8 = Nakao | first8 = Y | last9 = Ishizu | first9 = T | title = Aquaporin-4 autoimmune syndrome and anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-negative opticospinal multiple sclerosis in Japanese. | journal = Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 834–47 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19465451 | doi = 10.1177/1352458509104595 }}</ref>
* [[Devic's disease]], currently considered a separate disease

* [[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]] or ADEM, a closely related disorder in which a known virus or vaccine triggers autoimmunity against myelin.

* [[Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis]], possibly a variant of Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis

* [[Balo concentric sclerosis]], an unusual presentation of plaques forming concentrenic circles, which can sometimes get better spontaneously.

* [[Diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis|Schilder disease]] or diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis: is a rare disease that presents clinically as a pseudotumoural demyelinating lesion; and is more common in children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garrido C, Levy-Gomes A, Teixeira J, Temudo T |title=[Schilder's disease: two new cases and a review of the literature] |language=Spanish|journal=Revista de neurologia |volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=734–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15514902}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Afifi AK, Bell WE, Menezes AH, Moore SA |title=Myelinoclastic diffuse sclerosis (Schilder's disease): report of a case and review of the literature |journal=J.

Some others sources include in the list also other conditions associated with the presence of the scleroses<ref>Paul O'Connor, James Marriott, Differential Diagnosis and Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis: Application and Pitfalls</ref>

*[[Optic neuritis]] (monophasic and recurrent)
*[[Transverse myelitis]] (monophasic and recurrent)

As MS is an active field for research, the list is not closed or definitive. For example, some diseases like [[Susac's syndrome]] (MS has an important vascular component<ref>{{cite journal |author=Minagar A, Jy W, Jimenez JJ, Alexander JS |title=Multiple sclerosis as a vascular disease |journal=Neurol. Res. |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=230–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16687046 |doi=10.1179/016164106X98080}}</ref>), Myalgic encephalomyelitis (aka [[Chronic fatigue syndrome]])<ref>http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/overview.html?WT.z_gsac=1 ; "The following test results... are seen consistently...: Brain MRI showing swelling in the brain or destruction of part of the nerve cells (demyelination)</ref> or autoimmune variants of [[Peripheral neuropathy|peripheral neuropathies]] like [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]] or [[Progressive inflammatory neuropathy]] could be included assuming the autoimmune model. Also [[Leukodystrophy]] (which see) and its sub-conditions: [[Adrenoleukodystrophy]] and [[Adrenomyeloneuropathy]] could be in the list. Venous induced demyelination has also been proposed as a hypothetical MS variant produced by [[CCSVI]].

==Clinical courses inside standard MS==

Also inside standard MS different clinical courses can be separated.

===Progressive variants===

Some authors also think that primary progressive multiple sclerosis should be considered a different entity from standard MS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vukusic S, Confavreux C |title=Primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neurol. Sci. |volume=206 |issue=2 |pages=153–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12559503 |doi=10.1016/S0022-510X(02)00427-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dressel A, Kolb AK, Elitok E, Bitsch A, Bogumil T, Kitze B, Tumani H, Weber F |title=Interferon-beta1b treatment modulates cytokines in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis |journal=Acta Neurol.

===Subclinical, preclinical, CIS and CDMS===

The first manifestation of MS is the so-called Clinically isolated syndrome, or CIS, which is the first isolated attack. The current diagnosis criteria for MS does not allow doctors to give an MS diagnosis until a second attack takes place. Therefore the concept of "clinical MS", for a MS that can be diagnosed has been developed. Until MS diagnosis has been established, nobody can tell whether the disease dealing with is MS. 

Cases of MS before the CIS are sometimes found during other neurological inspections and are referred to as '''subclinical MS'''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hakiki B, Goretti B, Portaccio E, Zipoli V, Amato MP. |title=Subclinical MS: follow-up of four cases |journal= European Journal of Neurology|volume= 15|issue= 8|pages= 858–61|year=2008 |pmid=18507677 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2008.02155.x}}</ref> '''Preclinical MS''' refers to cases after the CIS but before the confirming second attack.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lebrun C, Bensa C, Debouverie M, ''et al.'' |title=Unexpected multiple sclerosis: follow-up of 30 patients with magnetic resonance imaging and clinical conversion profile |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=195–198 |year=2008 |pmid=18202208 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.108274}}</ref> After the second confirming attack the situation is referred to as CDMS (clinically defined multiple sclerosis).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frisullo G, Nociti V, Iorio R, ''et al.'' |title=The persistency of high levels of pSTAT3 expression in circulating CD4+ T cells from CIS patients favors the early conversion to clinically defined multiple sclerosis |journal=J Neuroimmunol. |volume=205 |issue=1-2 |pages=126–34 |year=2008 |month= December|pmid=18926576 |doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2008.09.003 }}</ref>

===Aggressive multiple sclerosis===

Relapsing-Remitting MS is considered aggressive when the frequency of exacerbations is not less than 3 during 2 years. Special treatment is often considered for this subtype.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sazonov | first1 = DV | last2 = Malkova | first2 = NA | last3 = Bulatova | first3 = EV | last4 = Riabukhina | first4 = OV | title = Combined therapy of aggressive remitted multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone in combination with copaxone | journal = Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

===Pediatric and pubertal MS===

MS cases are rare before puberty, but they can happen. Whether they constitute a separate disease is still an open subject. Anyway, even this pubertal MS could be more than one disease, because early-onset and late-onset have different demyelination patterns<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chabas D, Castillo-Trivino T, Mowry EM, Strober JB, Glenn OA, Waubant E |title=Vanishing MS T2-bright lesions before puberty: a distinct MRI phenotype? |journal=Neurology |volume=71 |issue=14 |pages=1090–3 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18824673 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000326896.66714.ae }}</ref>

==Controversy for the definition==

===Clinical vs. pathological definitions===

There is no agreement if MS should refer to a clinical course or to a pathological condition. Even assuming a pathological definition it is not clear if MS should refer to the presence of scars in CNS tissue or to the underlying condition that produces them, characterized by some yet unknown biomarkers.

Probably the most implicitly used definition is clinical, and can be found into the [[McDonald criteria]] proposal. This author state that "MS is a clinical entity and therefore should be diagnosized with clinical and paraclinical criteria".<ref name="pmid11456302">{{cite journal |author=McDonald WI |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis |url=http://www.msdiagnosed.org/McDonald.pdf|journal=[[Ann. Neurol.]] |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=121–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11456302 |doi= 10.1002/ana.1032 |author-separator=, |author2=Compston A |author3=Edan G |display-authors=3 |last4=Goodkin |first4=Donald |last5=Hartung |first5=Hans-Peter |last6=Lublin |first6=Fred D. |last7=McFarland |first7=Henry F. |last8=Paty |first8=Donald W. |last9=Polman |first9=Chris H.}}</ref> Currently the [[McDonald criteria]] are considered a ''clinical definition'' of MS.

Some other authors consider MS as a pathological entity instead, and propose a pathological definition.<ref>Dutta R, Trapp BD. Pathology and definition of multiple sclerosis, PMID 16948216</ref> According to Hans Lassmann, the pathological definition should be preferred because clinical definitions have problems with differential diagnosis.<ref>H. Lassmann, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, {{doi|10.1093/brain/awp342}}, [http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/2/317.extract]</ref> Of course, using a pathological definition would not prevent performing clinical diagnosis, but would require to calibrate any diagnosis criteria against it.

McDonald et al. do not agree with this, and they remark the clinical character of MS. They state that "Whereas it might be said that the only proved diagnosis of MS can be made upon autopsy, or occasionally upon biopsy, where lesions typical of MS can be directly detected through standard histopathological techniques, MS is essentially a clinical problem and can be diagnosed using clinical and paraclinical criteria""<ref name="McDonald">{{cite journal |author=McDonald WI, Compston A, Edan G, ''et al.'' |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis |url=http://www.msdiagnosed.org/McDonald.pdf|journal=[[Ann. Neurol.]] |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=121–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11456302 |doi= 10.1002/ana.1032}}</ref> 

At this moment, both definitions are currently used by each of their supporters and the relationship among them is not well documented.

===Current definitions===

The list of diseases included in the MS-spectrum is not closed because no formal definition of MS is normally given. For example, the [[World Health Organization]] does not give any explicit definition with [[ICD-10]] MS entry [http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gg35.htm+g35]. In [[ICD-9]] it used to say "chronic disease characterized by presence of numerous areas of demyelination in the central nervous system with symptoms such as weakness, incoordination, paresthesis, and speech disturbances"[http://www.icd9data.com/2009/Volume1/320-389/340-349/340/default.htm]. 

The [[Unified Medical Language System]] also gives very loose definitions of MS [http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/umlsdef.asp?glngUserChoice=8412]. The Medline medical dictionary defines it as "a demyelinating disease marked by patches of hardened tissue in the brain or the spinal cord and associated especially with partial or complete paralysis and jerking muscle tremor" [http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwmednlm?book=Medical&va=multiple%20sclerosis]. It uses the anatomical hallmark of the lesions, but also imposes the existence of clinical problems (paralysis and jerking muscle tremor)

Assuming a definition as weak as the previous ones, several diseases could be included inside the MS-spectrum. Other authors use a definition for MS based in its [[Illness|clinical]] course [http://msj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/14/9/1157]. Clinical definitions refer to the lesions and their location, but not to the nature of the lesions and this kind of definitions are potentially heterogeneous. As with any definition, patients have to be considered non-affected until the definition conditions are satisfied.
