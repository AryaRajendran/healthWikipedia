== Benefit of aesthetic medicine ==

The real benefit of practicing Aesthetic Medicine is the type of care that physicians are offering to their patients. These procedures are elective and are performed on patients who do not suffer from illness. They are usually happy and in excellent health. They simply want a quick fix or a preventative procedure to help manage the normal effects of aging.

When performed by a trained physician, non-surgical procedures are safer than plastic surgery as they do not require general anesthesia. They are usually quicker (can be done during lunch breaks) and are preferred by patients as they do not involve a scalpel and an operating table.
