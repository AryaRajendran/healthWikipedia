The term '''science by press conference''' is a phrase referring to scientists who put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the [[Mass media|media]].<ref name="techreview1989">Jerome F (1989). Science by press conference. ''[[Technology Review]]'' July 1989, No. 92, pp. 72-73.</ref> The term is usually used disparagingly.<ref name="hall2004">Hall, Stephen S. (2004). ''Merchants of Immortality: Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, ISBN 978-0-618-49221-3</ref> It is intended to associate the target with people promoting scientific "findings" of questionable scientific merit who turn to the media for attention when they are unlikely to win the approval of the professional scientific community. However, its use as an insult can also be a way that scientists who labor in obscurity can criticize scientists who seek to communicate directly with the public, or scorn scientists whose work for some reason catches the public's interest.

Premature publicity violates a cultural value of most of the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to [[independent review]] with a "thorough examination by the scientific community" before they are widely publicized.<ref name=EMBOreports/> The standard practice is to publish a paper in a [[peer-review]]ed scientific journal. This idea has many merits, including that the scientific community has a responsibility to conduct itself in a deliberative, non-[[attention seeking]] way; and that its members should be oriented more towards the pursuit of insight than fame. Science by press conference in its most egregious forms can be undertaken on behalf of an individual researcher seeking fame, a corporation seeking to sway public opinion or investor perception, or a political or ideological movement.

== History of the term ==

The phrase was coined by Spyros Andreopoulos, a public affairs officer at [[Stanford University Medical School]], in a 1980 letter which appeared in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.<ref name="Andreopoulos1980">Andreopoulos Spyros  (March 27, 1980). Gene Cloning by Press Conference. ''[[N Engl J Med]]'' 1980; 302:743-746</ref> Andreopoulos was commenting specifically on the publicity practices of [[biotechnology]] startups, including [[Biogen]] and [[Genentech]].<ref name=Hall>{{cite book |author=Hall, Stephen K. |title=Merchants of immortality: chasing the dream of human life extension |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-49221-6 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> The journal in which it appeared had implemented a long-standing policy under editor [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]] which prohibited seeking publicity for research prior to its submission or publication, informally called the Ingelfinger Rule.<ref name="angell1991">Angell, Marcia and Kassirer, Jerome P. (November 7, 1991). [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199111073251910 The Ingelfinger Rule Revisited.] ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''</ref>

=== Notable examples of science by press conference ===

* In 1989, chemists [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] held a press conference to claim they had successfully achieved [[cold fusion]].<ref name=EMBOreports/><ref name="wilford1989">Wilford, John Noble (April 24, 1989).

(1992). Cold Fusion and Hot History. Osiris, 2nd series, 7, 135-163.</ref>)
* In 1998, [[Andrew Wakefield]] held a press conference to claim that the [[MMR vaccine]] caused [[autism]].<ref name=EMBOreports/> In January 2011, an article by [[Brian Deer]] and its accompanying editorial in ''[[BMJ]]'' identified Wakefield's work as an "elaborate fraud".<ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ>{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume= 342:c7452 |title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |author= Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}</ref><ref name=NPRWakefield>{{cite news |url= http://www.npr.org/2011/01/05/132692497/journal-study-linking-vaccine-to-autism-was-fraud |publisher=NPR | agency= Associated Press |title= Study linking vaccine to autism was fraud  |date= 2011-01-05 |accessdate= 201-01-06}}</ref><ref name='discredited'>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7012267.ece |title=Lancet journal retracts Andrew Wakefield MMR scare paper |author=Rose, David|date=2010-02-03 |work=Times Online |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nGfAGGJ9 |archivedate=2010-02-03 | location=London}}</ref>
* In 2002, a group called [[Clonaid]] held a press conference to announce they had successfully achieved [[human cloning]].<ref name=EMBOreports/>
* In 2005, the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences (ERF) reported their findings from testing [[aspartame]] on rats. Their studies were widely criticized and later discounted.<ref name=Lofstedt>{{Cite journal | last = Lofstedt | first = Ragnar | authorlink = Ragnar Löfstedt | title = Risk communication, media amplification and the aspartame scare| journal = Risk Management | volume = 10  | issue = 4 | pages = 257–284 | date = Oct 2008 | doi = 10.1057/rm.2008.11}}</ref>

These cases became notorious examples of "science by press conference" precisely because they were widely reported in the press, but were later either rebuffed, debunked, or found to be outright fraud.

== Motivations ==

Competition for publicity, between scientific institutions or just individual researchers, is considered a driving force behind premature press conferences.<ref name=Winsten>{{cite journal |author=J A Winsten |title=Science and the media: the boundaries of truth |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=5–23 |year=1985 |month= |pmid= |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.4.1.5 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/5.citation}}</ref> Pressure to announce research findings quickly enough to "avoid losing credit" for any scientific advances may be enhanced by limited or highly competitive funding.<ref name=Winsten/>

Science by press conference does not have to involve a groundbreaking announcement. A manufacturer may desire to publicize results of research that suggest their product is safe. Science by press conference does not necessarily have to be directed at the general public. In some cases, it may be directed at a target market like opinion leaders, a specific industry, potential investors, or a specific group of consumers. [[Biotechnology]] companies, for example, have financial incentives to utilize premature press conferences to gain favorable media coverage.<ref name=Hall/><ref name="angell1991"/><ref name=Winsten/>

== Responsibility ==

While the phrase tends to criticize scientists involved in creating the publicity, it has also been used to assert that the media bear responsibility in many instances.<ref name=EMBOreports>{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 }}</ref> Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists' difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media's interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent "groundbreaking findings" rather than on the larger context of a research field. Further, when results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, basic journalism skills require skepticism and further investigation; the fact that they often do not can be seen as a problem with the media as much as with scientists who seek to exploit their power.

A common example of science by press conference occurs when the media report that a certain product or activity affects health or safety. For instance, the media frequently report findings that a certain food causes or prevents a disease. These reports sometimes contradict earlier reports. In some cases, it is later learned that a group interested in influencing opinion had a hand in publicizing a specific report.

The phrase also condemns different behavior in different fields. For instance, scientists working in fields that put an emphasis on the value of fast dissemination of research, like [[HIV]] treatment research, often first and most visibly disseminate research results via conferences or talks rather than through printed publication. In these areas of science, printed publication occurs later in the process of dissemination of results than in some other fields. In the case of HIV, this is partly the result of [[AIDS]] [[activism]] in which people with AIDS and their allies criticized the slow pace of research. In particular, they characterized researchers who kept quiet before publication as being more interested in their careers than in the well-being of people with AIDS. On the other hand, over-hyped early findings can inspire activists' ire and even their direct and critical use of the phrase "science by press conference." [[AIDS denialist]] groups have claimed that press conferences announcing findings in HIV and [[AIDS]] research, particularly [[Robert Gallo]]'s April 23, 1984, announcement of the discovery of the probable AIDS virus, inhibited research into non-HIV etiologies of AIDS.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kalichman, Seth C. |title=Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-387-79475-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%22Science+by+press+conference%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22Science%20by%20press%20conference%22%20-wikipedia&f=false |doi= |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

Similarly, clinical trials and other kinds of important medical research may release preliminary results to the media before a journal article is printed. In this case, the justification can be that clinicians and patients will benefit from the information even knowing that the data are preliminary and require further review. For instance, researchers did not wait to publish journal articles about the [[SARS]] outbreak before notifying the media about many of their findings, for obvious reasons. 

Another example might be the termination of a clinical trial because it has yielded early benefit. Publicizing this kind of result has obvious value; a delay of a few months might have terrible consequences when the results concern life-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the latter practice is especially vulnerable to abuse for self-serving ends and thus has drawn criticism similar to that implied by the phrase "science by press conference."<ref name="pmid18165635">{{cite journal |author=Wilcox RA, Djulbegovic B, Moffitt HL, Guyatt GH, Montori VM |title=Randomized trials in oncology stopped early for benefit |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=18–9 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18165635 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6259 |url=}}</ref>

These examples illustrate that the derision in the term "science by press conference" does not necessarily reflect an absolute rule to publish before publicizing. Rather, it illustrates the value that publicity should be a byproduct of science rather than its objective.
