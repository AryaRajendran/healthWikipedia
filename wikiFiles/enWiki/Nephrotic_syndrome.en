{{Distinguish|nephritic syndrome}}
'''Nephrotic syndrome''' is a triad of [[proteinuria]], [[hypoalbuminaemia]] and [[oedema]]. It is a nonspecific disorder in which the [[kidney]]s are damaged, causing them to leak large amounts of [[protein]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000955026|nephrotic syndrome}}</ref> ([[proteinuria]] at least 3.5&nbsp;grams per day per 1.73m<sup>2</sup> body surface area)<ref name="urlELECTRONIC LEARNING MODULE for KIDNEY and URINARY TRACT DISEASES">{{cite web |url=http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap7.html |title=ELECTRONIC LEARNING MODULE for KIDNEY and URINARY TRACT DISEASES |work= |accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref> from the [[blood]] into the [[urine]].

Kidneys affected by nephrotic syndrome have small pores in the [[podocyte]]s, large enough to permit [[proteinuria]] (and subsequently [[hypoalbuminemia]],<25g/L, because some of the protein [[albumin]] has gone from the blood to the urine) but not large enough to allow cells through (hence no [[hematuria]]). By contrast, in [[nephritic syndrome]] [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s pass through the pores, causing [[hematuria]].

==Signs and symptoms==
It is characterized by [[proteinuria]] (>3.5g/day), [[hypoalbuminemia]], [[hyperlipidemia]], and [[edema]] (which is generalized and also known as [[anasarca]] or dropsy) that begins in the face. [[Lipiduria]] (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. [[Hyponatremia]] also occurs with a low [[fractional sodium excretion]].

Hyperlipidemia is caused by two factors:
* Hypoproteinemia stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of lipoproteins.
* Lipid catabolism is decreased due to lower levels of lipoprotein lipase, the main enzyme involved in lipoprotein breakdown.<ref>http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s13c02.html</ref> Cofactors, such as [[Apolipoprotein C2]] may also be lost by increased filtration of proteins.

A few other characteristics seen in nephrotic syndrome are:
* The most common sign is [[excess fluid]] in the body due to the serum hypoalbuminemia. Lower serum oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitial tissues.  Sodium and water retention aggravate the edema.  This may take several forms:
** Puffiness around the [[Human eyes|eyes]], characteristically in the morning.
** [[Edema|Pitting oedema]] over the [[leg]]s.
** Fluid in the [[pleural cavity]] causing [[pleural effusion]]. More commonly associated with excess fluid is pulmonary edema.
** Fluid in the [[peritoneal cavity]] causing [[ascites]].
** Generalized edema throughout the body known as [[anasarca]].
* Most of the patients are normotensive but [[hypertension]] (rarely) may also occur.
* [[Anemia]] (iron resistant microcytic hypochromic type) maybe present due to transferrin loss.
* [[Dyspnea]] may be present due to [[pleural effusion]] or due to diaphragmatic compression with ascites.
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] is increased due to increased fibrinogen & other plasma contents.
* Some patients may notice foamy or frothy [[urine]], due to a lowering of the [[surface tension]] by the severe [[proteinuria]]. Actual urinary complaints such as [[hematuria]] or [[oliguria]] are uncommon, though these are seen commonly in [[nephritic syndrome]].
* May have features of the underlying cause, such as the [[rash]] associated with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], or the [[neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]].
* Examination should also exclude other causes of gross edema&mdash;especially the [[cardiovascular]] and [[hepatic]] system.
* [[Muehrcke's nails]]; white lines (leukonychia) that extend all the way across the nail and lie parallel to the lunula

==Causes==
Nephrotic syndrome has many causes and may either be the result of a disease limited to the kidney, called ''primary'' nephrotic syndrome, or a condition that affects the kidney and other parts of the body, called ''secondary'' nephrotic syndrome.

===Primary===
Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are usually described by the [[histology]], i.e. [[minimal change disease]] (MCD)-like minimal change nephropathy which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, and [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults.

They are considered to be "[[Diagnosis of exclusion|diagnoses of exclusion]]", i.e. they are diagnosed only after secondary causes have been excluded.

===Secondary===
Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome have the same histologic patterns as the primary causes, though may exhibit some difference suggesting a secondary cause, such as [[inclusion bodies]]. They are usually described by the underlying cause.

'''Secondary causes by histologic pattern:'''

Membranous nephropathy (MN):
*[[Hepatitis B]] 
*[[Sjögren's syndrome]]
*[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)
*[[Diabetes mellitus]]
*[[Sarcoidosis]]
*Drugs (such as corticosteroids, gold, intravenous heroin)
*[[Malignancy]] (cancer)
*Bacterial infections, e.g. leprosy & syphilis
*Protozoal infections, e.g. malaria

*Drugs, especially NSAIDs in the elderly
*Malignancy, especially [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]
*Allergy

*Hepatitis C

==Diagnosis==
The gold standard in diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome is 24 hour urine protein measurement.  Aiding in diagnosis are blood tests and sometimes imaging of the kidneys (for structure and presence of two kidneys), and/or a biopsy of the kidneys.

The following are baseline, essential investigations:
* 24 hour bedside urinary total protein estimation.
Urine sample shows [[proteinuria]] (>3.5 g per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per 24 hours). It is also examined for [[urinary casts]], which are more a feature of active nephritis.
* Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) shows [[hypoalbuminemia]]: [[albumin]] level ≤2.5 g/dL (normal=3.5-5 g/dL).
* Lipid profile.
High levels of [[cholesterol]] ([[hypercholesterolemia]]), specifically elevated [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], usually with concomitantly elevated [[Very low density lipoprotein|VLDL]] is typical.
* [[Electrolytes]], [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] (EUCs): to evaluate renal function.

Further investigations are indicated if the cause is not clear:
* Biopsy of [[kidney]].
* [[Auto-immune]] markers ([[Anti-nuclear antibody|ANA]], [[Antistreptolysin O titre|ASOT]], [[C3 (complement)|C3]], [[cryoglobulin]]s, [[Serum protein electrophoresis|serum electrophoresis]]).
* [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] of the whole abdomen.

{{familytree/end}}
</center>

===Differential diagnosis===
When someone presents with generalized edema, the following causes should be excluded:

# [[Heart failure]]: The patient is older, with a history of heart disease. Jugular venous pressure is elevated on examination, might hear heart murmurs. An echocardiogram is the gold standard investigation.
# [[Liver failure]]: History suggestive of hepatitis/ cirrhosis: alcoholism, IV drug use, some hereditary causes.<br/> Signs of liver disease are seen: [[jaundice]] (yellow skin and eyes), dilated veins over umbilicus ([[caput medusae]]), scratch marks (due to widespread itching, known as [[pruritus]]), enlarged spleen, [[spider angiomata]], encephalopathy, bruising, nodular liver.
# [[Acute (medicine)|Acute]] [[Hypervolemia|fluid overload]] in someone with kidney failure: These people are known to have kidney failure, and have either drunk too much or missed their dialysis.
# [[Metastasis|Metastatic cancer]]: when cancer spreads to the lungs or abdomen it causes effusions and fluid accumulation due to obstruction of lymphatics and veins, as well as serous exudation.

==Treatment==
{{Unreferenced section|April 2008|date=August 2008}}

Treatment includes:

===Supportive===
*Monitoring and maintaining euvolemia (the correct amount of fluid in the body):
** Monitoring urine output, BP regularly.
** Fluid restrict to 1 L.
** Diuretics (IV furosemide).

*Monitoring kidney function:
** do EUCs daily and calculating GFR.

*Treat hyperlipidemia to prevent further atherosclerosis.

*Prevent and treat any complications [see below]

*Albumin infusions are generally not used because their effect lasts only transiently.

Prophylactic anticoagulation may be appropriate in some circumstances.<ref name="pmid17599972">{{cite journal |author=Glassock RJ |title=Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome: a clinical conundrum |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=2221–5 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17599972 |doi=10.1681/ASN.2006111300 |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17599972}}</ref>

===Specific===
* Immunosuppression for the glomerulonephritides ([[corticosteroid]]s,<ref name="pmid17943754">{{cite journal |author=Hodson E, Willis N, Craig J |editor1-last=Hodson |editor1-first=Elisabeth M |title=Corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD001533 |year=2007 |pmid=17943754 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001533.pub4}}</ref> [[ciclosporin]]).

* Standard ISKDC regime for first episode: [[prednisolone]] -60&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day in 3 divided doses for 4 weeks followed by 40&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day in a single dose on every alternate day for 4 weeks.

* Relapses by prednisolone 2&nbsp;mg/kg/day till urine becomes negative for protein. Then, 1.5&nbsp;mg/kg/day for 4 weeks.

* Frequent relapses treated by: [[cyclophosphamide]] or nitrogen mustard or ciclosporin or [[levamisole]].

* Achieving better blood glucose level control if the patient is diabetic.

* [[Blood pressure]] control. [[ACE inhibitors]] are the drug of choice. Independent of their blood pressure lowering effect, they have been shown to decrease protein loss.

===Diet===
Reduce sodium intake to 1000–2000&nbsp;mg daily.  Foods high in sodium include salt used in cooking and at the table, seasoning blends (garlic salt, Adobo, season salt, etc.) canned soups, canned vegetables containing salt, luncheon meats including turkey, ham, bologna, and salami, prepared foods, fast foods, soy sauce, ketchup, and salad dressings.  On food labels, compare milligrams of sodium to calories per serving.  Sodium should be less than or equal to calories per serving.

Eat a moderate amount of high protein animal food: 3-5 oz per meal (preferably lean cuts of meat, fish, and poultry)

Avoid saturated fats such as butter, cheese, fried foods, fatty cuts of red meat, egg yolks, and poultry skin.  Increase unsaturated fat intake, including olive oil, canola oil, peanut butter, avocadoes, fish and nuts.  Eat low-fat desserts.

Increase intake of fruits and vegetables.  No potassium or phosphorus restriction necessary.

Monitor fluid intake, which includes all fluids and foods that are liquid at room temperature.  Fluid management in nephrotic syndrome is tenuous, especially during an acute flare.Treatment for nephrotic syndrome depends on the cause and the age of the person who has the condition. Medicines, changes in diet, and care for other conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, are all possible treatments for this syndrome. These treatments may reverse, slow, or prevent further kidney damage.

Most children who have nephrotic syndrome do well with treatment and have a normal life expectancy.

Doctors define complete recovery as living without symptoms or treatment for more than 2 years.







Initial treatment

Treatment of nephrotic syndrome depends on the cause of the disease and may include:

    Corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone, to reduce swelling.
    Diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in the body (edema) and to help with reducing sodium, potassium, and water. Fluid reduction should occur slowly to avoid further kidney damage and low blood pressure.
    Medicines, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), to reduce the amount of protein lost in the urine, lower blood pressure, and slow the progress of the disease.
    In rare cases, salt-free albumin given through a vein (IV). Albumin helps remove extra fluid from the tissues.

First treatments can last from 6 to 15 weeks, often longer in adults. Depending on how severe your symptoms are or whether they return, ongoing treatment may be needed for months to years, or even for the rest of your life.
Ongoing treatment

Ongoing treatment for nephrotic syndrome and complications of the disease include:

    Daily or alternate-day prednisone, if nephrotic syndrome returns.
    Cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil, when treatment with corticosteroids is not successful.
    Steps to lower blood pressure, including medicine, a healthier diet, and exercise. Untreated high blood pressure increases your risk for stroke or heart attack. For more information, see the topics High Blood Pressure, Coronary Artery Disease, and Stroke.
    Changes in diet to replace nutrients lost through the urine, reduce fluid buildup in the body, and reduce the risk of complications. Some doctors prescribe a diet that limits protein, salt (sodium), and fats but is high in carbohydrates. The amount of protein allowed may vary, depending on your condition.
    Anticoagulants, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or heparin, to treat blood clots if they form.
    Early treatment of infections with antibiotics.
    Vaccinations with a pneumococcal vaccine, chickenpox (varicella) vaccine, and a yearly flu shot. Vaccination is not recommended until nephrotic syndrome has responded to treatment with corticosteroids.
    Calcium and vitamin D supplements to protect your bones and help prevent osteoporosis during long-term corticosteroid treatment (for example, prednisone).

You may need emotional support during treatment for nephrotic syndrome. If you or your child has nephrotic syndrome and you are having a hard time handling treatment or the severity of your child's condition, it may help to talk with a doctor or seek counseling.
Treatment if the condition gets worse

Sometimes treatment for nephrotic syndrome is unsuccessful. If this occurs, you may develop chronic kidney disease. Your doctor may recommend that you begin hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or consider a kidney transplant. For more information, see the topic Chronic Kidney Disease.

Clinical trials are ongoing to test more effective medicines for the treatment of steroid-resistant (relapsing) nephrotic syndrome. If treatment has not successfully controlled your nephrotic syndrome, ask your doctor about clinical trials. To take part in a clinical trial, you may need to travel to a large treatment center.

==Complications==
* [[Venous thrombosis]]: due to leak of anti-thrombin 3, which helps prevent thrombosis. This often occurs in the renal veins. Treatment is with oral anticoagulants (not heparin as heparin acts via anti-thrombin 3 which is lost in the proteinuria so it will be ineffective.) Hypercoagulopathy due to extravasation of fluid from the blood vessels (oedema) is also a risk for venous thrombosis.

* [[Infection]]: due to leakage of immunoglobulins, encapsulated bacteria such as ''Haemophilus influenzae'' and ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' can cause infection.

* [[Acute renal failure]] is due to [[hypovolemia]]. Despite the excess of fluid in the tissues, there is ''less'' fluid in the vasculature. Decreased blood flow to the kidneys causes them to shutdown. Thus it is a tricky task to get rid of excess fluid in the body while maintaining circulatory euvolemia.

* [[Pulmonary edema]]: again due to fluid leak, sometimes it leaks into lungs causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[dyspnoea]].

* [[Growth retardation]]: does not occur in MCNS.It occurs in cases of relapses or resistance to therapy. Causes of growth retardation are protein deficiency from the loss of protein in urine, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (reduced protein intake), and steroid therapy (catabolism).

* [[Vitamin D deficiency]] can occur. Vitamin D binding protein is lost.

* [[Hypothyroidism]] can occur. Thyroxine is reduced due to decreased thyroid binding globulin.

* Microcytic [[hypochromic]] anaemia is typical.  It is iron-therapy resistant.

* [[Hypocalcemia]] can occur as a result of nephrotic syndrome. It may be significant enough to cause [[tetany]]. Hypocalcemia may be relative; calcium levels should be adjusted based on the albumin level and ionized calcium should be checked.

* [[Cushing's Syndrome]]

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends on the cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is usually good in children, because [[minimal change disease]] responds very well to [[steroids]] and does not cause [[chronic renal failure]]. However other causes such as [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] frequently lead to [[end stage renal disease]]. Factors associated with a poorer prognosis in these cases include level of [[proteinuria]], [[blood pressure]] control and kidney function ([[Glomerular filtration rate|GFR]]).
