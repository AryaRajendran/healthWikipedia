! Instrument !! Uses
|-
| Instrument sterilizers || Used to sterilize instruments in absence of an autoclave
|-
| Dressing drums || storage of gowns, cotton, linen, etc.
|-
| The [[microscope]] || used for visualising minute structures including [[microbes]].
|-
| Various [[Staining|stains]] || used to stain microscopic slides to get contrast
|-
| [[Hot air oven]] || used in sterilizing instruments for various [[aseptic]] procedures, specially if that can not be autoclaved like powders.
|-
| [[Robert Koch|Koch]]'s or Arnold's [[steam sterilizer]] || used for steam sterilization
|-
| A [[pressure cooker]] || used as a portable autoclave.
|-
| Biological and chemical [[indicators]] || Used to ascertain if a certain process has been completed, e.g. spores used in an autoclave are killed if autoclaving is properly done.''For details, see [[indicators]]''
|-
| [[Filtration|Filters]]: ||
|-

|-
| •[[Disk filter]] or Seitz filter || previously used as bacteriological filters; presently obsolete
|-
| •[[Sintered glass filter]] || used as a good particle filter in laboratories. 
|-
| •[[Membrane technology|Membrane filter]] and [[Syringe filter]] || used as primary bacterial/cell filters in procedures as [[toxin]], [[immunoglobulin]], etc. production, where the product gets denatured on heating.

|-
|[[Inspissator]] || used to produce [[culture media]] for bacteriology that contain egg or serum, which coagulate on heating.
|-
|[[Tyndallizer]] || a process of sterilization from [[spore]] bearing [[bacteria]]; ''vide link''
|-
| Water bath || to heat things uniformly from all sides at a set temperature up to the boiling point of water.
|-
