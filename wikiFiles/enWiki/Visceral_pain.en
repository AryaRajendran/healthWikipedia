'''Visceral pain''' is pain that results from the activation of [[nociceptors]] of the thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal [[viscera]] (organs). Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), [[ischemia]] and [[inflammation]], but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to localize and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomit, changes in vital signs as well as emotional manifestations. The pain may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull <ref>Urch CE & Suzuki R. Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain. In: Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S. Clinical pain management: Cancer pain. 2 ed. London: Hodder Arnold; ISBN 9780340940075. p. 3–12</ref> Distinct structural lesions or biochemical abnormalities explain this type of pain in only a proportion of patients. These diseases are grouped under gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMD). Others can experience visceral pains, often very intense in nature, without any evidence of structural, biochemical or histolopathologic reason for such symptoms. These diseases are grouped under [[functional gastrointestinal disorders]] (FGID) and the pathophysiology and treatment can vary greatly from GINMD. The two major single entities among functional disorders of the gut are [[functional dyspepsia]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].  <ref>Gschossmann JM, Holtmann G, Mayer EA.

==Epidemiology==

In the past viscera were considered insensitive to pain but now it is clear that pain from internal organs is widespread and that its social burden may surpass that of pain from superficial ([[somatic]]) sources. Myocardial ischemia, the most frequent cause of cardiac pain, is the most common cause of death in the United States.<ref>Silverman DHS. Curr Rev Pain 1999; 3(4):291-299</ref> Urinary colic produced from ureteral stones has been categorized as one of the most intense forms of pain that a human being can experience. The prevalence of such stones has continuously increased, reaching values of over 20% in developed countries.<ref>Trinchieri A, et al. Eur Urol 2000; 37(1):23-25</ref><ref>Vasavada PV, et al. In: Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica’s Management of Pain. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2001, pp 1309-1325</ref> Surveys have shown prevalence rates among adults of 25% for intermittent abdominal pain and 20% for chest pain; 24% of women suffer from pelvic pain at any point in time. For over two-thirds of sufferers, pain is accepted as part of daily life and symptoms are self-managed; a small proportion defer to specialists for help. Visceral pain conditions are associated with diminished quality of life, and exert a huge cost burden through medical expenses and lost productivity in the workplace.<ref>Smita L.S. Halder and G.

== Clinical presentation ==

Visceral pain should be suspected when vague midline sensations of [[malaise]] are reported by a patient. True visceral pain is characterized as a vague, diffuse, and poorly defined sensation.<ref name=twelve>Procacci P, et al. In: Cervero F, Morrison JFB (Eds). Visceral Sensation, Progress in Brain Research, Vol. 67. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1986, pp 21-28.</ref><ref name=fourteen>Vecchiet L, et al. Pain 1989; 36:289-295.</ref> Regardless of specific organ of origin, the pain is usually perceived in the midline spanning anywhere from the lower abdomen up to the chest. In the early phases the pain is perceived in the same general area and it has a temporal evolution, making the onset sensation insidious and difficult to identify.<ref name=thirteen>Giamberardino MA. Eur J Pain 1999; 3(2):77-92.</ref> 

The pain is typically associated with involvement of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Some of these symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, vomit, changes in [[vital signs]] including [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]] and/or temperature. Strong emotional reactions are also common presenting signs and may include anxiety, anguish and a sense of impending doom. Visceral pathology may also manifest only through emotional reactions and discomfort where no pain is reported. The intensity of visceral pain felt has no relationship to the extent of internal injury.<ref name=thirteen /><ref name=fifteen>Cervero F. Gut 2000; 47:56-57</ref>

As visceral pain changes in nature as it progresses. Pain from a specific organ can be experienced, or “referred” to different sites of the body. There is no [[pathology]] or no cause for pain at these referred [[somatic]] sites however the pain will be experienced at this location, often with significant intensity. [[Referred pain]] is sharper, better localized, and less likely to be accompanied by autonomic or emotional signs.<ref name=fourteen /><ref name=fifteen />

A good example of visceral pain that is common place and embodies the wide spectrum of clinical presentations discussed above is a [[myocardial infarction]] (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack. This pain is secondary to [[ischemia]] of the cardiac tissue. The most common presenting symptom is [[chest pain]] that is often described as tightness, pressure or squeezing. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, over several minutes and tends to be located in the central chest (overlying the [[sternum]]) although it can be experienced in the left chest, right chest, and even abdominal area. Associated symptoms, which are mostly autonomic in nature, include [[diaphoresis]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[palpitations]], and [[anxiety]] (which often described as a sense of impending doom).<ref>Mallinson, T (2010). "Myocardial Infarction". Focus on First Aid (15): 15. Retrieved 2010-06-08.</ref><ref>National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Heart Attack Warning Signs. Retrieved November 22, 2006</ref> [[Referred pain]] is experienced most commonly radiating down the left arm however it can also radiate to the lower [[jaw]], [[neck]], [[back]] and [[epigastrium]]. Some patients, especially [[elderly]] and [[diabetics]], may present with what is known as a painless myocardial infarction or a “silent heart attack.” A painless MI can present with all of the associated symptoms of a heart attack, including nausea, vomit, anxiety, heaviness, or chocking, but the classic chest pain described above is lacking.<ref name=twelve /><ref>Davis TM, Fortun P, Mulder J, Davis WA, Bruce DG (2004). "Silent myocardial infarction and its prognosis in a community-based cohort of Type 2 diabetic patients: the Fremantle Diabetes Study". Diabetologia 47 (3): 395–9. doi:10.1007/s00125-004-1344-4. PMID 14963648.</ref>

It is always important for not only the physician but also the patient to remember the dissociation between magnitude of injury to internal organs and the intensity of pain and how this can be potentially dangerous if overlooked, for example a silent heart attack.<ref name=main>Carr, D.B. (2005). "Visceral Pain" International Association for the Study of Pain. VXIII, No.6</ref> It is also important to remember that the opposite is also true; sometimes intense visceral pain does not signify a significant [[pathologic]] process, for example intense gas pains.

== Neurobiology ==

The vague and poorly defined sensation as well as its temporal nature, characteristic of visceral pain, is due to the low density of sensory innervation of [[viscera]] and the extensive divergence of visceral input within the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).<ref name=twelve /><ref name=fourteen />
The phenomenon of [[referred pain]] is secondary to the convergence of visceral [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent (sensory) nerve fibers]] entering the [[spinal cord]] at the same level as the superficial, [[somatic]] structures experiencing the pain. This leads to a misinterpretation of incoming signals by higher brain centers.<ref name=fourteen /><ref name=fifteen />

== Treatment ==

There are two goals when treating visceral pain: to alleviate the current experience of pain and to address any underlying [[pathology]], if and when identifiable. Treatment of the pain in many circumstances should be deferred until the origin of the symptoms has been identified. Masking pain may confound the diagnostic process and delay the recognition of life threatening conditions. Once a treatable condition has been identified there is no reason to withhold symptomatic treatment. Also, if cause for the pain is not found in reasonable time then symptomatic treatment of the pain could be of benefit to the patient in order to prevent long-term [[sensitization]] and provide immediate relief.<ref name=thirteen /><ref name=two>Giamberardino MA. In: Devor M, et al. (Eds). Proceedings of the 9th World Congress on Pain, Progress in Pain Research and Management, Vol. 16. Seattle: IASP Press, 2000, pp 523-550.</ref><ref name=fourtyseven>Song SO, Carr DB. Pain: Clin Updates 1999; VII:1.</ref>

Symptomatic treatment of visceral pain relies primarily upon [[pharmacotherapy]]. Since visceral pain can result secondary to a wide variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of [[analgesics]] (ex. [[opiates]], [[NSAIDs]], [[benzodiazepines]]), [[antispasmodics]] (ex. [[loperamide]]), [[antidepressants]] (ex. [[TCA]], [[SSRI]], [[SNRI]]) as well as others (ex. [[ketamine]], [[clonidine]], [[gabapentin]]). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs.<ref name=nine>Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica’s Management of Pain, 3rd ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001.</ref> For example the use of [[nitrates]] can reduce [[Angina pectoris|anginal pain]] by dilating the [[coronary arteries]] and thus reducing the [[ischemia]] causing the pain. The use of spasmolytics (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut.<ref name=twelve /> There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include [[side effect]]s (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), [[chemical dependence]] or [[addiction]], and inadequate pain relief.  

Invasive therapies are in general reserved for patients in whom pharmacological and other non-invasive therapies are ineffective. A wide variety of interventions are available and shown to be effective, a few will be discussed here. Approximately 50-80% of [[pelvic]] [[cancer]] pain patients benefit from [[nerve block]]s.<ref>Patt RB. Cancer pain. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott; 1993</ref><ref>Rodriquez-Bigas M, Petrelli NJ, Herrera L, West C. Intrathecal phenol rhizotomy for management of pain in recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum. Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991;173:41–4.</ref> Nerve blocks offer temporary relief and typically involve injection of a nerve bundle with either a [[local anesthetic]], a [[steroid]], or both. Permanent nerve block can be produced by destruction of nerve tissue. Strong evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials support the use of [[neurolytic]] [[celiac plexus]] block to alleviate pain and reduce opioid consumption in patients with [[malignant]] pain originating from abdominal viscera such as the [[pancreas]].<ref>54. Eisenberg E, et al. Pain: Clin Updates 2005; XIII:5.</ref> [[Neurostimulation]], from a device such as a [[spinal cord stimulator]] (SCS), for refractory angina has been shown to be effective in several randomized controlled trials.<ref>Jessurun GA, et al. Eur J Pain 2003; 7(6):507-512.</ref><ref>Diedrichs H, et al. Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med 2005; 6(1):7.</ref> A SCS may also be used for other chronic pain conditions such as [[chronic pancreatitis]] and [[Familial Mediterranean Fever]]. Other devices that have shown benefit in reducing pain include [[Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator|transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators]] (TENS), targeted field stimulation, both used for somatic [[hyperalgesic]] states, external neuromodulation, [[pulsed radiofrequency|pulsed radiofrequency ablation]] and [[neuraxial blockade|neuraxial]] drug delivery systems.<ref name=main /><ref name=painreview>Knowles C.H., Aziz Q, "Basic and clinical aspects of gastrointestinal pain" PAIN 141 (2009) 191-209</ref>
