'''Estriol''' (also '''oestriol''' or '''E3''') is one of the three main [[estrogen]]s produced by the human body.

==Biosynthesis==
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|300px|left|Human [[steroidogenesis]], showing estriol at bottom right. In essence, it follows the pathway from dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA (at left), but with a modified DHEA with an additional OH-group.]]
Estriol is only produced in significant amounts during [[pregnancy]] as it is made by the placenta from [[16-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (16-OH DHEAS),<ref name="pmid2141460">{{cite journal | author = Raju U, Bradlow HL, Levitz M | title = Estriol-3-sulfate in human breast cyst fluid.

The human placenta produces [[pregnenolone]] and [[progesterone]] from circulating [[cholesterol]]. Pregnenolone is converted in the fetal adrenal gland into [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), a C19 steroid, then subsequently sulfonated to [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (DHEAS). DHEAS is converted to ''16-OH DHEAS'' in the fetal liver. The placenta converts 16-OH DHEAS to estriol, and is the predominant site of estriol synthesis.

==Levels==
Levels of estriol in non-pregnant women do not change much after [[menopause]], and levels are not significantly different from levels in men.

==Therapeutic use==
In pregnant women with [[multiple sclerosis]], estriol reduces the disease's symptoms noticeably,<ref name="pmid12325070">{{cite journal | author = Sicotte NL, Liva SM, Klutch R, Pfeiffer P, Bouvier S, Odesa S, Wu TC, Voskuhl RR | title = Treatment of multiple sclerosis with the pregnancy hormone estriol | journal = Ann.

==Use in screening==
Estriol can be measured in maternal blood or urine and can be used as a marker of fetal health and wellbeing. [[DHEA-S]] is produced by the [[adrenal cortex]] of the fetus. This is converted to estriol by the [[placenta]].

If levels of "unconjugated estriol" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate chromosomal or congenital anomalies like [[Down syndrome]] or [[Edward's syndrome]]. It is included as part of the [[triple test]] & [[quadruple test]] for antenatal screening for fetal anomalies.

Because many pathological conditions in a pregnant woman can cause deviations in estriol levels, these screenings are often seen as less definitive of fetal-placental health than [[non-stress testing]]. Conditions which can create [[false positives]] and [[false negatives]] in estriol testing for fetal distress include [[preeclampsia]], [[anemia]], and impaired [[kidney function]].<ref name="isbn0-323-05747-0">{{cite book | author = Pagana TJ, Pagana KD | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Mosby's Manual of Diagnostic and Laboratory Tests | edition = | language = | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louis | year = 2009 | origyear = | pages = 240 | quote = | isbn = 0-323-05747-0 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>
