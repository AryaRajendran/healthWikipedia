'''''Medical Hypotheses''''' is a [[public health journal|medical journal]] published by [[Elsevier]]. It was originally intended as a forum for unconventional ideas without the traditional filter of scientific [[peer review]], "so long as (the ideas) are coherent and clearly expressed" in order to "foster the diversity and debate upon which the scientific process thrives."<ref name="science daily">{{cite news

The journal's lack of peer review<ref name="science 3.8.10"/> and publication of ideas that are considered clear [[pseudoscience]],<ref name = "nattrass"/> particularly [[AIDS denialism]],<ref name="aidstruth-letter"/> attracted considerable criticism, including calls to remove it from [[PubMed]], the prestigious [[United States National Library of Medicine]] online journal database.<ref name = "nattrass"/> Following the AIDS papers controversy, Elsevier forced a change in the journal's leadership. In June 2010, Elsevier announced that "Submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editor and external reviewers to ensure their scientific merit", suggesting that peer review is now in place.<ref name=companynews>http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authored_newsitem.cws_home/companynews05_01563</ref>

== Founding and editorship ==

''Medical Hypotheses'' was founded in 1975 by physiologist [[David Horrobin]], who was the editor-in-chief of the journal until his death in 2003 as well as the head of the Schizophrenia Association in Britain.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/david-horrobin-730218.html "David Horrobin: Champion of evening primrose oil"]</ref> Horrobin was a controversial figure, a scientist and entrepreneur best known for his promotion of [[oenothera|evening primrose oil]] as a treatment for diseases, leading the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' (BMJ) to predict that he "may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age."<ref name="science 3.8.10">{{cite news

In what [[psychiatrist]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist [[Ben Goldacre]] called an "almost surreally crass paper", two ''Medical Hypotheses'' authors posited "[[mongoloid]]" as an accurate term for people with [[Down syndrome]] because those with Down's share characteristics with people of [[Asian people|Asian]] origin, including a reported interest in crafts, sitting with crossed legs and eating foods containing [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).<ref name=BadScience>{{cite news

== Peer review debate{{Anchor|Coverage and controversy}} ==
Horrobin began the journal in response to what he viewed as the limitations of peer review.<ref name="science 3.8.10"/> According to physiologist [[John Stein (physiologist)|John Stein]], Horrobin believed from his days as an undergraduate that peer review encourages adherence to currently accepted ideas at the expense of innovation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Stein|first1=John |last2= |first2= |year= 2008|title= David Horrobin (1939–2003): a memoir |journal= Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids|volume= 70|issue= 4|pages= 339–344|url=http://www.physiol.ox.ac.uk/~jfs/pdf/horrobin.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.plefa.2004.01.001 |pmid= 15085824}}</ref>  Also neuroscientist [[Vilayanur Ramachandran]], who is on the journal's editorial review board, told ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'': "There are ideas that may seem implausible but which are very important if true. This is the only place you can get them published."<ref name="science 3.8.10"/>

=== AIDS denialism papers and fallout ===
In 2009, the journal's publisher, Elsevier, withdrew two articles written by [[AIDS denialism|AIDS denialists]] that had been accepted for publication. One of the withdrawn<ref name=Withdrawal>[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987709004472 Withdrawal notice.]</ref> articles,<ref name=DuesbergPH>Duesberg PH ''et al'' [http://cdn3.libsyn.com/darrenmain/Final-MED_HYPOTHESES_.pdf?nvb=20100417150508&nva=20100418151508&t=085cd8ede29c32be754c4 HIV-AIDS hypothesis out of touch with South African AIDS – A new perspective]. ''Medical Hypotheses'', (2009), {{doi|10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.024}}</ref> written by [[Peter Duesberg]] and [[David Rasnick]], claimed that there is "yet no proof that HIV causes AIDS" and was not responsible for deaths in South Africa that another paper had attributed to it and misrepresented the results of medical research on [[antiretroviral drug]]s.<ref name=BadScience/> The publisher stated that the articles "could potentially be damaging to global public health. Concern has also been expressed that the article contains potentially libelous material. Given these important signals of concern, we judge it correct to investigate the circumstances in which this article came to be published online."<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619953 Elsevier statement on PubMed]</ref>

The withdrawal followed a campaign by scientists who criticised the articles' factual accuracy and the process behind their acceptance.<ref name=BadScience/><ref>[http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2009/elsevier-retracts-duesberg%E2%80%99s-aids-denialist-article AIDSTruth.org]</ref> A group of 20 HIV scientists and advocates contacted the [[National Library of Medicine]] to request that the journal be removed from the [[MEDLINE]] database alleging that the journal lacked scientific rigor and had become a "tool for the legitimization of at least one pseudoscientific movement [[AIDS denialism]]."<ref name="aidstruth-letter">{{cite web| format = PDF | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/sites/aidstruth.org/files/NLMLetter-2009.08.05.pdf | publisher = Aidstruth.org | author = Abdool Karim SS et al | title = Letter to the National Library of Medicine Literature Selection Technical Review Committee | date = August 5, 2009 | accessdate = December 8, 2009}}</ref> Economist [[Nicoli Nattrass]] wrote in an article in ''AIDS and Behavior'' that "''Medical Hypotheses'' has long been a source of concern in the scientific community because the articles are not peer-reviewed," and that the [[National Library of Medicine]] had been requested to review the journal "for de-selection from PubMed on the grounds that it was not peer-reviewed and had a disturbing track record of publishing pseudo-science."<ref name="nattrass">{{cite journal |author=Nattrass N |title=Still Crazy After All These Years: The Challenge of AIDS Denialism for Science |journal=AIDS Behav |volume= 14|issue= 2|pages= 248–51|year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19937271 |doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9641-z |url=}}</ref>

As a result of the controversy, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reported that Elsevier had asked that the journal's editor either raise the standards of review or resign.<ref name=Enserink>Martin Enserink, [http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/03/elsevier-to-editor-change-contro.html Elsevier to Editor: Change Controversial Journal or Resign]. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', March 8, 2010</ref> A review panel convened by Elsevier recommended that ''Medical Hypotheses'' adopt some form of peer review to avoid publication of "baseless, speculative, non-testable and potentially harmful ideas". Editor Bruce Charlton said that peer review went against the journal's 30-year history and is not supported by either him or the journal's editorial board.<ref name=THE23Jan>{{cite news

Of the journal's 19 editorial board members, 13 wrote to Elsevier to protest the decision to change the journal's editorial policies.<ref name="science 3.8.10"/> The group of scientists wrote that not having peer review "is an integral part of our identity, indeed our very raison d'être," and they would resign their positions if it was instituted.<ref name="science 3.8.10"/> One of the members, [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] of the University of Cardiff School of Medicine, said that the review board members' letter was "a defense of Bruce, not of the Duesberg paper."<ref name="science 3.8.10"/> In contrast, board member [[Antonio Damasio|António Damásio]] said that the paper should not have been published on the journal's website.<ref name="science 3.8.10"/>

In June 2010, Elsevier announced the appointment of [[Mehar Manku]] as the new editor,<ref name=Insider/> and stated that "(s)ubmitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editor and external reviewers to ensure their scientific merit. All reviewers will be fully aware of the Aims and Scope of the journal and will be judging the premise, originality and plausibility of the hypotheses submitted." Manku was previously the Editor of ''[[Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids]]'',<ref name=companynews/> another journal founded by Horrobin.<ref>http://www.bmj.com/content/326/7394/885.1.full</ref>
