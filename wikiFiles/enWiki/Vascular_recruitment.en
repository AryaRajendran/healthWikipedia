'''Vascular recruitment''' is the increase in the number of perfused [[capillaries]] in response to a stimulus. I.e., the more you exercise regularly, the more oxygen can reach your muscles.

==Synonym==
Vascular recruitment may also be called '''capillary recruitment'''.

==Vascular recruitment in skeletal muscle==
The term «vascular recruitment» or «capillary recruitment» usually refers to the increase in the number perfused capillaries in [[skeletal muscle]] in response to a stimulus. The most important stimulus in humans is regular [[exercise]].<ref>Vascular recruitment in forearm muscles during exercise. Palm T, Nielsen SL, Lassen NA. Clin Physiol. 1983 Oct;3(5):445-51.</ref><ref>Capillary recruitment in exercise: rate, extent, uniformity, and relation to blood flow. Honig CR, Odoroff CL, Frierson JL. Am J Physiol. 1980 Jan;238(1):H31-42.</ref> Vascular recruitment in skeletal muscle is thought to enhance the capillary surface area for oxygen exchange and decrease the oxygen diffusion distance.

Other stimuli are possible. [[Insulin]] can act as a stimulus for vascular recruitment in skeletal muscle. This process may also improve glucose delivery to skeletal muscle by increasing the surface area for diffusion. That insulin can act in this way has been proposed based on increases in limb blood flow and skeletal muscle blood volume which occurred after [[hyperinsulinemia]].<ref>Vascular recruitment in skeletal muscle during exercise and hyperinsulinemia assessed by contrast ultrasound. Dawson D, Vincent MA, Barrett EJ, Kaul S, Clark A, Leong-Poi H, Lindner JR. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2002 Mar;282(3):E714-20.</ref><ref>Direct evidence for insulin-induced capillary recruitment in skin of healthy subjects during physiological hyperinsulinemia.

Coggins M, Lindner J, Rattigan S, Jahn L, Fasy E, Kaul S, Barrett E. Diabetes. 2001 Dec;50(12):2682-90.</ref>

The exact extent of capillary recruitment in intact skeletal muscle in response to regular exercise or insulin is unknown, because non invasive measurement techniques are not yet extremely precise.<ref>Non-invasive study of pulmonary vascular recruitment during exercise. Bougaci N, Costes F, Bertoletti L. Rev Pneumol Clin. 2010 Jun;66(3):173-8. French.</ref>

Being [[overweight]] or [[obese]] may negatively interfere with vascular recruitment in skeletal muscle.<ref>Visceral and truncal subcutaneous adipose tissue are associated with impaired capillary recruitment in healthy individuals. de Jongh RT, Ijzerman RG, Serné EH, Voordouw JJ, Yudkin JS, de Waal HA, Stehouwer CD, van Weissenbruch MM.

==Vascular recruitment in the lung==
Vascular recruitment in the lung (i.e., in the pulmonary [[microcirculation]])<ref>Physiology of pulmonary capillary recruitment. Wagner WW Jr, Hervé P. Rev Mal Respir. 1989;6(1):39-44. French.</ref> may be noteworthy to healthcare professionals in [[emergency medicine]], because it may increase evidence of lung injury,<ref>Vascular recruitment increases evidence of lung injury. Ehrhart IC, Orfanos SE, McCloud LL, Sickles DW, Hofman WF, Catravas JD. Crit Care Med. 1999 Jan;27(1):120-9.</ref> and increase pulmonary capillary protein leak.<ref>Effects of pulmonary vascular recruitment on gamma scintigraphy and pulmonary capillary protein leak. Sugerman HJ, Tatum JL, Strash AM, Hirsch JI, Greenfield LJ. Surgery. 1981 Aug;90(2):388-95.</ref>

==Vascular recruitment in the brain==
Vascular recruitment in the brain is thought to lead to new capillaries and increase the [[cerebral blood flow]].<ref>Concurrent vasculogenesis and neurogenesis from adult neural stem cells. Ii M, Nishimura H, Sekiguchi H, Kamei N, Yokoyama A, Horii M, Asahara T. Circ Res. 2009 Oct 23;105(9):860-8.</ref><ref>What is the blood–brain barrier (not)? Bechmann I, Galea I, Perry VH.

Am J Physiol. 1993 May;264(5 Pt 2):H1740-3.</ref>

==Controversy==
The existence of vascular recruitment in response to a stimulus has been disputed by some researchers.<ref>Counterpoint: There is not capillary recruitment in active skeletal muscle during exercise. Poole DC, Brown MD, Hudlicka O. J Appl Physiol. 2008 Mar;104(3):891-3.</ref> However, most researchers accept that vascular recruitment exists.<ref>Point: There is capillary recruitment in active skeletal muscle during exercise. Clark MG, Rattigan S, Barrett EJ, Vincent MA. J Appl Physiol. 2008 Mar;104(3):889-91.</ref>
