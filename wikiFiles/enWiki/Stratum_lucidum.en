The '''stratum lucidum''' (Latin for "clear layer") is a thin, clear layer of dead skin cells in the [[epidermis]] named for its translucent appearance under a [[microscope]]. It is readily visible by light microscopy only in [[Glabrousness#Glabrous_skin|areas of thick skin]], which are found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=80rSnSZWFhMC&pg=PA41</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=wyFYTCus8OgC&pg=PA376</ref> 

Located between the [[stratum granulosum]] and [[stratum corneum]] layers, it is composed of three to five layers of dead, flattened [[keratinocytes]].<ref name="Rooks">McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M.

The thickness of the lucidum is controlled by the rate of [[mitosis]] (division) of the epidermal cells. In addition, [[melanocyte]]s determine the darkness of the stratum lucidum. The cells of the stratum lucidum are flattened. They are surrounded by an oily substance that is the result of the [[exocytosis]] of [[lamellar bodies]] accumulated while the keratinocytes are moving through the [[stratum spinosum]] and stratum granulosum.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
