'''Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma''' ('''ATL''') is a rare [[cancer]] of the immune system's own [[T-cell]]s.<ref name="pmid4544052">{{cite journal |pages=572–3 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197403072901018 |title=Still More on NBT Technic |year=1974 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=290 |issue=10 |pmid=4544052 |last1=Yodoi |first1=J |last2=Takatsuki |first2=K |last3=Masuda |first3=T}}</ref><ref name="pmid301762">{{cite journal |pmid=301762 |year=1977 |last1=Uchiyama |first1=T |last2=Yodoi |first2=J |last3=Sagawa |first3=K |last4=Takatsuki |first4=K |last5=Uchino |first5=H |title=Adult T-cell leukemia: Clinical and hematologic features of 16 cases |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=481–92 |journal=Blood}}</ref><ref name="pmid22068231">{{cite journal |pages=423–8 |doi=10.1007/s12185-011-0957-x |title=The discovery of ATL: an odyssey in restrospect |year=2011 |journal=International Journal of Hematology |volume=94 |issue=5 |pmid=22068231 |last1=Yodoi |first1=J |last2=Maeda |first2=M}}</ref>

Human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type 1 ([[HTLV-1]]) is believed to be the cause of it,<ref name="pmid15726602">{{cite journal |pages=232–9 |doi=10.1002/ajh.20307 |title=Current views in HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma |year=2005 |last1=Nicot |first1=Christophe |journal=American Journal of Hematology |volume=78 |issue=3 |pmid=15726602}}</ref> in addition to several other diseases.

==Signs and symptoms==
ATL is usually a highly aggressive [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] with no characteristic [[histologic]] appearance except for a diffuse pattern and a mature T-cell [[phenotype]]. Circulating [[lymphocyte]]s with an irregular nuclear contour (leukemic cells) are frequently seen. Several lines of evidence suggest that HTLV-1 causes ATL. This evidence includes the frequent isolation of HTLV-1 from patients with this disease and the detection of HTLV-1 proviral [[genome]] in ATL leukemic cells. ATL is frequently accompanied by visceral involvement, [[hypercalcemia]], lytic bone lesions, and [[skin lesion]]s. Most patients die within one year of diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma |title=Treatment and prognosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> 

Infection with HTLV-1, like infection with other [[retroviruses]], probably occurs for life and can be inferred when [[antibody]] against HTLV-1 is detected in the [[blood plasma|serum]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Transmission==
Transmission of [[HTLV-1]] is believed to occur from mother to child; by sexual contact; and through exposure to contaminated blood, either through [[blood transfusion]] or sharing of contaminated needles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Treatment==
Treatment options that have been tried include [[zidovudine]] and the [[CHOP]] regimen.<ref name="pmid16155611">{{cite journal |pages=6047–57 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1208979 |title=Natural history of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and approaches to therapy |year=2005 |last1=Taylor |first1=Graham P |last2=Matsuoka |first2=Masao |journal=Oncogene |volume=24 |issue=39 |pmid=16155611}}</ref> [[Pralatrexate]] has also been investigated.<ref name="pmid19389878">{{cite journal |pages=6338–41 |doi=10.1182/blood-2009-03-210989 |title=Pralatrexate-induced tumor cell apoptosis in the epidermis of a patient with HTLV-1 adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia causing skin erosions |year=2009 |last1=Marneros |first1=A.

Recently, it has been reported that the traditional glucocorticoid-based chemotherapy toward ATL are largely mediated by thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/TXNIP/VDUP1), suggesting the potential use of a TBP-2 inducer as a novel therapeutic target.<ref name="pmid21151022">{{cite journal |pages=440–8 |doi=10.1038/leu.2010.286 |title=Thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2/VDUP1/TXNIP) regulates T-cell sensitivity to glucocorticoid during HTLV-I-induced transformation. |year=2011 |last1=Chen |first1=Z |last2=Lopez-Ramos |first2=D |journal=Leukemia |volume=25 |issue=3 |pmid=21151022}}</ref><ref name=pmid20398702>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Z|coauthors=Yoshihara E|title=Differential roles of Annexin A1 (ANXA1/lipocortin-1/lipomodulin) and thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/VDUP1/TXNIP) in glucocorticoid signaling of HTLV-I-transformed T cells.|journal=Immunology Letters|year=2010|volume=131|issue=1|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/j.imlet.2010.04.003|pmid=20398702}}</ref>

Recently, mogamulizumab (Poteligeo), has been approved for the treatment of ATL in Japan.

==Epidemiology==
HTLV-1 infection in the [[United States]] appears to be rare. Although little [[serologic]] data exist, prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among blacks living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among black intravenous drug abusers in [[New Jersey]], and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in [[New Orleans]]. It is possible that prevalence of infection is increasing in this risk group. Studies of HTLV-1 antibody indicate that the virus is endemic in southern [[Japan]], in the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], and in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

ATL is relatively uncommon among those infected with [[HTLV-1]]. The overall incidence of ATL is estimated at about 1 per 1,500 adult HTLV-1 carriers per year. Those cases that have been reported have occurred mostly among persons from the Caribbean or blacks from the Southeast (National Institutes of Health, unpublished data). There appears to be a long latent period between [[HTLV-1]] infection and the start of ATL.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Research==
Novel approaches to the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed or refractory setting are under investigation. [[Pralatrexate]] is one compound currently under investigations for the treatment of PTCL.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==In pregnancy==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.<ref name=Shapira />  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of [[pregnancy loss]] and [[birth defect]]s, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive [[first trimester]].<ref name=Shapira>{{cite journal
