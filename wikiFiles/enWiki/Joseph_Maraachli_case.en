The '''Joseph Maraachli case''' refers to an international controversy over the life of Joseph Maraachli, commonly known as '''Baby Joseph''', a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[infant]] who was diagnosed with a rare progressive and incurable [[neurologic disorder]] called [[Leigh's disease]]. After Canadian doctors refused to perform a [[tracheotomy]], calling the procedure invasive and futile, Joseph's parents fought to have him transferred to the [[United States]], arguing that while Joseph's disease was terminal, a tracheotomy would extend his life and allow him to die at home. After several months and efforts by American [[pro-life]] groups, Joseph was transferred to a Catholic hospital in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the procedure was performed.

The successfully-obtained procedure extended Joseph's life for several months. Joseph died on Tuesday, September 27, 2011 at his home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/09/28/baby-joseph-reportedly-dies-in-his-canadian-home/ |title='Baby Joseph' Dies in His Canadian Home Surrounded by Family |author= |date=September 28, 2011 |work= |publisher=''FoxNews.com''}}</ref><ref name="abc1028"/>

==History==
===Background===
Joseph Maraachli was born on January 22, 2010.<ref name="cnn">{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/02/24/canada.health.dispute/ |title=Canadian family fights to move baby on life support to U.S. |author=Sabriya Rice |date=February 25, 2011 |publisher=''CNN.com''}}</ref> His parents, Moe Maraachli and Sana Nader, immigrated to [[Canada]] from [[Lebanon]] in the 1990s, settling in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]].<ref name="canadadotcom1">{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=f1deee57-6bec-42a7-9f04-c98aee25caf4&p=1 |title=On god's time |author=Sonja Puzic |date=February 26, 2011 |work= |publisher=''The Windsor Star''}}</ref> 

In 2002, the couple's 18-month-old daughter, Zina, died from a degenerative disorder.<ref name="postdispatch1">{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/fitness/article_6ae0f115-6360-57e6-bfed-c97fbb682317.html |title='Let him breathe,' baby's dad implores |author=Blythe Bernhard |date= March 16, 2011 |work= |publisher=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''}}</ref> After undergoing a [[tracheotomy]], she was taken home and cared for by her parents for her final sixth months.<ref name="postdispatch1" /> Then when she was near death, her parents took her back to the hospital, hoping to make her as comfortable as possible.<ref name="londonfreepress">{{cite web |url=http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2011/02/28/17440436.html |title=Hospital disclosure muddies baby case |author=Jonathan Sher |date=March 1, 2011 |work= |publisher=''London Free Press''}}</ref>

Maraachli once repaired computers, but gave up this work to take care of his wife Sana, who has [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]].<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> The couple depended on Sana's [[disability]] payments and support from her family.<ref name="canadadotcom1" />

===Beginning of medical issues===
When Joseph was around three months old, his parents said they noticed he couldn't eat or breathe properly, and wouldn't open his eyes or cry.<ref name="cnn" /> In June 2010, they took him to a hospital in [[Michigan]] a few miles away from Windsor, which is located directly on the [[Canada – United States border]].<ref name="cnn" /> At the Michigan hospital, he was diagnosed with a metabolic brain disease that the doctor said would make him [[developmental disability|developmentally delayed]], and was treated, his health reportedly improving.<ref name="cnn" /> However, in the car on the way back from a family trip to [[Toronto]] in October 2010, he stopped breathing, so he was rushed to an [[emergency room]] in [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]] and later transferred to the [[London Health Sciences Centre]] (LHSC) in [[London, Ontario|London]].<ref name="canadadotcom1" />

===Parents and doctors disagree===
Tests and examinations on Joseph were carried out by eight specialists over a few weeks following his transfer to the LHSC.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> The doctors concluded that he was suffering from a "severe and progressively deteriorating neurological state" and was in a  [[persistent vegetative state]].<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> They were in "unanimous agreement" that he did not have any chance of recovering and that there were no treatment options available to help him.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> 

The parents disputed the conclusion that Joseph was in a persistent vegetative state, saying he responded to being tickled and jostled when he felt discomfort.<ref name="cnn" /> The family wanted a tracheotomy for him, believing it would allow him to breathe on his own, and thus be taken out of the hospital so he could "die peacefully with mom, dad at home."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/02/17/windsor-maraachli-joseph.html |title=Windsor parents want sick child to die at home |author= |date=February 17, 2011 |work= |publisher=''CBC.ca''}}</ref> They  hoped the procedure could prolong Joseph's life by up to six months because it had extended his older sister Zina's life by six months when she was dying of the same condition.<ref name="londonfreepress" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2014841556_canadianboy22.html |title=Baby returns home to Canada after treatment in U.S. |author=Jim Salter |date=April 21, 2011 |work= |publisher=''Seattle Times''}}</ref> The couple also stated that, if their son was able to live longer due to the procedure, he would die "when God says he should."<ref name="canadadotcom1" />

The doctors at the hospital refused to perform a tracheotomy because they said it would needlessly protract Joseph's death and increase the risk of [[infection]], [[pneumonia]], and other complications.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> Since the time of Zina's tracheotomy, more had been learned about the procedure, leading doctors to conclude it was not appropriate in Joseph's case.<ref name="torontosunsims">{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2011/02/18/17322476.html |title=Judge orders baby off life-support |author=Jane Sims |date=February 18, 2011 |work= |publisher=''Global BC''}}</ref> Dr. Douglas Fraser, a pediatric critical care specialist and the lead doctor handling the case, proposed that Joseph's [[Tracheal tube|breathing tube]] be removed, with the expectation that he would die soon afterward from his inability to breathe unaided.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> His parents refused to agree to this proposal.<ref name="canadadotcom1" />

===Legal challenges===
London Heath Services Centre directed the case to the Consent and Capacity Board of Ontario.<ref name="dailymail">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366107/Right-life-baby-Joseph-Maraachli-taken-U-S-ditch-effort-prolong-life.html |title='Now the real battle begins': First picture of Baby Joseph in U.S. hospital as doctors prepare to carry out last-gasp operation|author= |date=March 15, 2011 |work= |publisher=''The Daily Mail''}}</ref> It explained in a statement that it sought the Board's decision on "whether or not Joseph’s parents were complying with the principles for substitute decision-making under the provincial ''Health Care Consent Act'' in refusing to consent to the proposed treatment plan."<ref name="lhscstatement">{{cite web |url=http://www.lhsc.on.ca/About_Us/Baby_Joseph/index.htm |title=Just the Facts: Medical, Legal and Ethical Issues |author=|date=|work= |publisher=London Health Services Centre}}</ref>

The hearing before the Board took place in January 2011.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> On January 22, the Board released its decision, holding that the course of action in the child's "best interests" would be "removal of the [[endotracheal tube]] without replacement, a [[Do not resuscitate|Do Not Resuscitate]] order and [[palliative care]]."<ref name="lhscstatement" />

The parents were ordered to [[consent]] to the removal of the breathing tube.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> They decided to appeal the Board's decision in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]], retaining a lawyer, Geoff Snow, through [[legal aid]].<ref name="canadadotcom1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/appeal+denied+baby+to+die+in+hospital/96212/story.html |title=Appeal denied: Baby to die in hospital|author=Sonya Puzic |date=February 18, 2011 |work= |publisher=''Toronto Sun''}}</ref> The case was heard by Justice Helen Rady on February 17, 2011.<ref name="canadadotcom2">{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=8231452a-e448-4334-939d-fbbe48c613e8 |title=Couple lose appeal to bring baby home |author=Sonja Puzic |date=February 18, 2011 |work= |publisher=''Edmonton Journal''}}</ref> An hour after the lawyers delivered their arguments, Justice Rady returned with her decision, upholding the Board's decision as "reasonable" and dismissing the family's appeal.<ref name="torontosunsims" /><ref name="canadadotcom2" />

Removal of the breathing tube had been scheduled for the morning of February 18, but Justice Rady moved the date to February 21, stating the intent of giving the family "adequate time to say their good-byes."<ref name="torontosunsims" /><ref name="canadadotcom2" /> The family was ordered to give consent for the breathing tube's removal by February 21.<ref name="torontostar1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/942568--london-family-refuses-to-remove-baby-s-breathing-tube |title=Windsor family refuses court order to let baby die |author=Pat Hewitt |date=February 21, 2011 |work= |publisher=''The Toronto Star''}}</ref> 

On February 20, the family fired Snow, as he did not advise pursuing an appeal of Justice Rady's ruling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2011/02/21/wdr-baby-breathing-tube-story.html |title=Dying baby's breathing tube removal delayed |author=|date=February 21, 2011 |work= |publisher=''CBC News''}}</ref> With the support of Alex Schadenberg of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition, they took on a new lawyer, Mark Handelman.<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> The family refused to consent to the breathing tube's removal, and thus it was not removed on February 21.<ref name="torontostar1" /> Handelman attempted to negotiate Joseph's transfer to the [[Children's Hospital of Michigan]] in [[Detroit]].<ref name="canadadotcom1" /> The Children's Hospital initially accepted the request, but later chose to reject the request after receiving the baby's medical file.<ref name="canadadotcom1" />

On February 28, the London Health Services Centre put out a media release, stating it was willing to transfer Joseph to his home but would remove the ventilator once he was there.<ref name="londonfreepress" /> Handelman confirmed that the hospital had made such an offer, but objected to its public disclosure, stating it had been presented during confidential negotiations.<ref name="londonfreepress" /> He said Joseph's parents had already rejected the offer prior to the media release, considering it "unacceptable."<ref name="londonfreepress" />

On March 1, it was revealed that Handelman was no longer representing the family, though he did not disclose the reason.<ref name="londonfreepress2">{{cite web |url=http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2011/03/01/17454761.html |title=Lawyer off Baby Joseph case |author=Kate Dubinski and Jonathan Sher|date=March 2, 2011 |work= |publisher=''London Free Press''}}</ref> The family retained another lawyer, Claudio Martini, on March 5, and he announced the following week that they planned to file an appeal of the Superior Court decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=6991ebd7-7646-4ff5-b618-0e4423fd53cd |title=Baby's family files new appeal|author=Chris Thompson|date=March 9, 2011 |work= |publisher=''The Windsor Star''}}</ref>

===Transfer to the United States===
Various [[pro-life]] organizations such as [[Priests for Life]], the [[Terri Schiavo]] Life & Hope Network, and the [[American Center for Law and Justice]], among others, began helping the family and began negotiating in March 2011 with hospitals around the [[United States]] to have Joseph transferred. Priests for Life announced it had secured a [[Jet aircraft|jet]] which was standing by to immediately fly the family to any American hospital willing to care for Joseph.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2011/03/05/17505041.html |title= Jet at ready to move Baby Joseph |author=Kate Dubinski |date=March 4, 2011 |work= |publisher=''Toronto Sun''}}</ref>

On March 14, 2011, Priests for Life announced it had secured a transfer to [[SSM Health Care|SSM]] [[Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital|Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center]], a non-profit [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] hospital in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], declaring victory in the "battle against the medical bureaucracy in Canada."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/03/13/baby-joseph-gets-second-chance-life/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Baby Joseph' Gets Second Chance at Life in U.S |author= |date=March 14, 2011 |work= |publisher=''FoxNews.com''}}</ref> Priests for Life also announced it would pay for Joseph's medical care at Cardinal Glennon.

Once Joseph was in Cardinal Glennon, Priests for Life said hospital officials were happy that Joseph was breathing mostly on his own, but the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' reported that "Cardinal Glennon officials said they were 'puzzled' by those claims and said Joseph remained on a ventilator."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bernhard|first=Blythe|title=Dying infant's surgery raises ethical questions|url=http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/fitness/article_5028b80b-028d-5723-ad11-883ff88aac0f.html|accessdate=March 19, 2011|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=March 15, 2011}}</ref>

On March 21, 2011, doctors performed a tracheotomy on Joseph. He was expected to remain in the hospital for seven to ten days, then be transferred to a St. Louis pediatric specialty hospital, then be sent home with his family.<ref name="CNN2">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/03/21/baby.joseph/?hpt=T2 |title='Baby Joseph' receives tracheotomy at St. Louis hospital |author=Sabriya Rice |date=March 21, 2011 |work= |publisher=''CNN.com''}}</ref> Joseph was [[Baptism|baptized]] the week of the tracheotomy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifenews.com/2011/03/23/baby-joseph-maraachli-baptized-family-pleased-with-tracheotomy/ |title=Baby Joseph Maraachli Baptized, Family Pleased with Tracheotomy |author=Steven Ertelt |date=March 23, 2011 |work= |publisher=''LifeNews.com''}}</ref> Maraachli and Nader are an [[interfaith marriage|interfaith couple]], being [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Catholic]], respectively; Maraachli said he wanted his son to be "raised in the religion of his mother."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/baby-josephs-baptism-shows-lifes-eternal-destiny-godfather-says/ |title=Godfather: Baby Joseph's baptism shows life's eternal destiny |author=Benjamin Mann|date=March 25, 2011 |work= |publisher=''Catholic News Agency''}}</ref>

====Diagnosis====
Doctors at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center diagnosed Joseph with [[Leigh's disease]], a rare neurometabolic disorder which causes the degeneration of the [[central nervous system]]. The disease is usually [[genetics|inherited]], but no genetic link for Joseph was found after his parents were tested.<ref name="CNN2"/> The Maraachlis lost an 18-month old child to the same condition eight years before Joseph was diagnosed.<ref name="CBS">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20056434-10391704.html |title= Who has right to tell Baby Joseph to die? |author=Neil Katz |date=April 22, 2011 |work= |publisher=''CBS News''}}</ref> The doctors at the SSM hospital said the tracheotomy they performed gave Joseph a more stable airway, extra mobility and comfort, and protected his lungs.<ref name="CBS"/>

===Going home===
On April 21, 2011, Joseph was transported from the hospital in St. Louis to his home in Windsor, Ontario.<ref name="home">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/20/baby-joseph-return-home-canada/ |title='Baby Joseph' Flying Home to Canada |author= |date=April 21, 2011 |work= |publisher=''FoxNews.com''}}</ref> Priests for Life paid for all of the medical bills incurred and the return flight home.<ref name="home"/>

At home, Joseph was breathing on his own and showed signs of consciousness, such as opening his eyes or moving around in response to his father's touch; his father said Joseph knew when he was holding him.<ref name="vancouversun">[http://www.vancouversun.com/health/feel+victorious+says+Baby+Joseph+father/4669344/story.html 'I feel victorious,' says Baby Joseph's father]</ref> [[Brother (Catholic)|Brother]] Paul O'Donnell, a friend of the Maraachli family, says he had seen Joseph turn his head to his father when his father spoke, and to his mother when his mother spoke, and also said he had seen him throw [[temper tantrums]] such as when his diaper was changed.<ref name="CBS"/> At one point in the presence of a ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' reporter, Joseph's father held out his finger and Joseph grabbed it.<ref name="vancouversun"/> With Joseph home, his father said, "I feel victorious. I feel I won and my baby's alive."<ref name="vancouversun"/> O'Donnell described Joseph's condition at home as a [[miracle]].<ref name="CBS"/> Joseph's father said the fact that he had to travel to St. Louis to get care for his son angered him. However, the ''Vancouver Sun'' reported that he was positive about the outcome of his and others' efforts, and said he didn't think about when his son would die, but left that up to [[God]].<ref name="vancouversun"/>

===Death===
Joseph lived more than 6 months after the tracheotomy, breathing on his own, and died peacefully in his sleep on September 27, 2011 at the age of 20 months.<ref name="CNNdeath"/><ref name="CBCdeath">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2011/09/28/wdr-baby-joseph.html |title=Priest says Baby Joseph 'fulfilled mission |author= |date=September 28, 2011 |work= |publisher=''CBC News''}}</ref> He had been living at home with his family since April 21, 2011.<ref name="CNNdeath">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/28/health/baby-joseph/?hpt=he_c2 |title='Baby Joseph,' focus of treatment dispute, dies in his sleep |author=Maggie Schneider and Sabriya Rice |date=September 29, 2011 |work= |publisher=''CNN.com''}}</ref> Fr. Pavone said, "This young boy and his parents fulfilled a special mission from God. Amidst a Culture of Death where despair leads us to dispose of the vulnerable, [the Maraachli family] upheld a [[Culture of Life]] where hope leads us to welcome and care for the vulnerable."<ref name="CBCdeath"/>

A private funeral for Joseph was held on September 28.<ref name="CBCdeath" /> He was buried beside his sister Zina at a cemetery in Windsor.<ref name="CBCdeath" />

===Aftermath===
On October 4, 2011, the Maraachlis held a press conference with the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network in which Moe Maraachli said he was considering a request for an investigation<ref name="LFP"/> and a lawsuit against the Canadian doctors who refused to treat and release Joseph, noting that the family incurred over $46,000 in legal fees during the ordeal.<ref name="windsorstar">[http://www.windsorstar.com/sports/Baby+Joseph+family+seeks+probe/5502421/story.html Baby Joseph’s family seeks probe]</ref> Maraachli said he was angry at the Canadian doctors but thankful for the Cardinal Glennon "angel doctors".<ref name="LFP">[http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2011/10/05/18787346.html No word on possible lawsuit]</ref> Maraachli said Joseph wasn't suffering or in pain at home.<ref name="windsorstar"/> The family and the Network are exploring ways to work together to promote the pro-life position with respect to end-of-life issues.<ref name="LFP"/> Maraachli said he wants the Canadian medical system to change so that doctors are required to more seriously consider the wishes of the family of a dying family member.<ref name="windsorstar"/> He said he would "go after" the Canadian doctors. Maraachli had a message for Joseph:
{{blockquote|"I made a promise to my son: I will give you back your human rights and dignity if you pass away or not...Fly and tell God about what happened with you and about the doctor that tried to kill you. Your life touched the world."<ref name="windsorstar"/><ref name="CBCpressconference">[http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/10/05/wdr-baby-joseph-family.html Baby Joseph's parents say 'shame on doctors']</ref>}}

==Impact==
The case became a focal point for the ethical debate over the extent to which end-of-life care should be provided.<ref name="abc1028">Hutchison, Courtney. [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/baby-joseph-dies-home-long-treatment-battle/story?id=14623722 'Baby Joseph' Dies at Home After Long Treatment Battle], ''ABC News'' Medical Unit, Sept. 28, 2011. Retrieved 2011-10-12.</ref> The case draws many parallels to the [[Terri Schiavo case]], where a court ordered hydration removed from a woman in a vegetative state, in compliance with the consent authorized by her husband, despite protests from her parents. Schiavo subsequently died of dehydration. The Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network, a foundation founded by Schiavo's family, was involved in the Maraachli case.<ref name="cnn">[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/02/24/canada.health.dispute/ Canadian family fights to move baby on life support to U.S.]</ref> The international pro-life community rallied around the family, offering support and money to help pay for the medical costs.<ref name="vancouversun"/>
