'''Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|l|b|ər|z}}; October 11, 1758 – March 2, 1840) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] and [[astronomer]].

==Life and career==
Olbers was born in Arbergen, today part of [[Bremen]], and studied to be a [[physician]] at [[Göttingen]]. After his graduation in 1780, he began practicing [[medicine]] in Bremen. At night he dedicated his time to [[astronomy|astronomical]] observation, making the upper story of his home into an [[observatory]]. He also devised the first satisfactory method of calculating cometary orbits.

On March 28, 1802, Olbers discovered and named the [[asteroid]] Pallas. Five years later, on March 29, 1807, he discovered the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], which he allowed [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to name.  As the word "asteroid" was not yet coined, the literature of the time referred to these [[minor planets]] as [[planets]] in their own right.  He proposed that the [[asteroid belt]], where these objects lay, was the remnants of a [[Phaeton (planet)|planet that had been destroyed]]. The current view of most scientists is that tidal effects from the planet Jupiter disrupted the planet-formation process in the asteroid belt.

On March 6, 1815, Olbers also discovered a periodic [[comet]], now named after him (formally designated [[13P/Olbers]]).

Olbers was deputed by his fellow citizens to assist at the [[baptism]] of [[Napoleon II of France]] on June 9, 1811, and he was a member of the ''corps legislatif'' in [[Paris]] 1812–1813. He died in Bremen aged 81. He was twice married, and one son survived him.

[[Olbers' paradox]], described by him in 1823 (and then reformulated in 1826), states that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the supposition of an infinite and eternal [[static universe]].

In 1804 he was elected a [[fellow of the Royal Society]] of London <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27olbers%27%29| title = Library and archive catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 2012-03-06}}</ref> and in 1827 was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

==Honors==
The following celestial features are named for him:
* [[13P/Olbers]] is a periodic [[comet]].
* [[Asteroid]] [[1002 Olbersia]].
* The crater [[Olbers (crater)|Olbers]] on the [[Moon]].
* [[4 Vesta#Surface features|Olbers]], a 200-km-diameter dark albedo feature on Vesta's surface
