The '''history of malaria''' predates humanity, as this ancient disease evolved before [[Human evolution|humans did]]. [[Malaria]], a widespread and potentially lethal infectious disease, has afflicted people for much of [[history of the world|human history]], and has affected settlement patterns.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Carter R, Mendis KN | title =Evolutionary and historical aspects of the burden of malaria | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 564–94| year = 2002 | pmid = 12364370 | url =  http://skishore.wikispaces.com/file/view/Evo-Historical+Aspects+of+Malaria.pdf }}</ref> The prevention and treatment of the disease have been investigated in science and medicine for hundreds of years, and, since the discovery of the [[parasite]] which causes it, attention has focused on its biology. These studies have continued up to the present day, since no effective [[Malaria vaccine]] has yet been developed and many of the older [[antimalarial drug]]s are losing effectiveness as the parasite evolves high levels of [[drug resistance]]. As malaria remains a major public health problem, causing 250 million cases of fever and approximately one million deaths annually, understanding its history is key.

==Origin and early history==

Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America, where it is now for all purposes non-existent. The coastal plains of [[southern Italy]], for example, fell from international prominence (the Crusaders going by sea to the [[Holy Land]] took ship at [[Bari]]) when malaria expanded its reach in the sixteenth century.

''''Warburg's Tincture''''

In 1834, in [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]), a German physician, [[Carl Warburg]], invented an [[antipyretic]] medicine: '[[Warburg's Tincture]]'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine and a number of different other [[Herbalism|herbs]]. Trials were made in Europe in the 1840s and 1850s, and it was officially adopted by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1847. Warburg's Tincture gained a high, international reputation. It was considered by many eminent medical professionals to be a more efficacious [[antimalarial]] drug than quinine. It was also more economical. The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in [[India]] and other colonies.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Maclean WC |title= Professor Maclean, C.B., on the true composition and therapeutic value of Warburg's Tincture |journal=Lancet |volume=106|pages=716–718 |year=1875|doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(02)30835-3 |issue= 2724}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Poser CM, Bruyn GW.  |title= An Illustrated History of Malaria, p. 87|journal=New York: Parthenon, ISBN 978-1-85070-068-5 |year=1999  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N4fyLSwLP3MC&dq=%22An+illustrated+history+of+malaria%22&printsec=frontcover&q= |publisher= Informa Health Care |isbn= 978-1-85070-068-5}}</ref>

'''Synthetic drugs'''

[[William Henry Perkin]], a student of [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]]  at the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] in London,  tried in the 1850s to synthesize quinine in a commercially practicable process. The idea was to take two equivalents of N-allyltoluidine (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>13</sub>N) and three atoms of oxygen to produce quinine (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>24</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and water. The experiments were unsuccessful. However, Perkin's [[Mauve]] was produced when attempting [[quinine total synthesis]]  via the oxidation of N-allyltoluidine.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Seeman JI|title= The Woodward-Doering/Rabe-Kindler total synthesis of quinine: setting the record straight|journal=  Angew Chem Int Ed Engl.|volume= 46 |issue= 9 |pages=1378–413 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17294412 |doi= 10.1002/anie.200601551}}</ref> Before Perkin's discovery all [[dye]]s and pigments were derived from roots, leaves, insects, or, in the case of [[Tyrian purple]], [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Perkin's discovery of artificially synthesized dyes led to important advances in medicine, photography, and many other fields.

In 1885 [[Ettore Marchiafava]], [[Angelo Celli]] and [[Camillo Golgi]] studied the reproduction cycles in human blood (Golgi cycles). Golgi observed that all parasites present in the blood divided almost simultaneously at regular intervals and that division coincided with attacks of fever. Golgi also recognized that the three types of malaria are caused by different protozoan organisms. By 1890 Laveran's germ was generally accepted but most of Laveran's initial ideas had been discarded in favor of the taxonomic work and clinical [[pathology]] of the Italian school.  Marchiafava and Celli called the new microorganism ''[[Plasmodium]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Smith DC, Sanford LB.|title= Laveran's germ: the reception and use of a medical discovery|journal= Am J Trop Med Hyg|volume= 34 |issue= 1|pages=2–20 |year= 1985 |pmid= 2578751}}</ref> Pel, presaging its discovery by over 50 years, proposed the first theory of the existence of a tissue stage of the malaria parasite in 1886.

Shortly after this Sakharov in 1889 and Marchiafava & Celli in 1890 independently identified ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' as a species distinct from ''P. vivax'' and ''P. malariae''. In 1890, Grassi and Feletti reviewed the available information and named both ''P. malariae'' and ''P. vivax'' with the following statement: "C'est pour cela que nous distinguons, dans le genre ''Haemamoeba'', trois espèces (''H. malariae'' de la fièvre quarte, ''H. vivax'' de la fièvre tierce et ''H. praecox'' de la fièvre quotidienne avec coutres intermittences etc.)."<ref name=Grassi1890>Grassi B and Feletti R (1890) Parasites malariques chez les oiseaux.

=== Therapeutic uses ===

In the early twentieth century, before [[antibiotics]], patients with [[syphilis]] were intentionally infected with malaria to create a fever. In the 1920s [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]], a Viennese [[psychiatrist]], began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced ''P. vivax'' malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (''Spirochaeta pallida'' also known as ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''). ''P. vivax'' infections were terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wagner-Jauregg J. | title = Verhütung und Behandlung der Progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria | journal = Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, Ergänzungsband München | year = 1931 }}</ref> Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of [[chemotherapeutic]] research and was practised until 1950.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Frankenburg FR, Baldessarini RJ| title = Neurosyphilis, malaria, and the discovery of antipsychotic agents| journal = Harv Rev Psychiatry. | volume = 16 | issue =5 | pages = 299–307| year = 2008 | pmid =18803105 | doi = 10.1080/10673220802432350 }}</ref> Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of [[general paralysis|dementia paralytica]].<ref name="nobel-1927">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1927/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1927 | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation}}</ref>

Starting in World War II, [[DDT]] was used as insecticide to combat [[insect vector]]s carrying [[malaria]], which was endemic in most tropical regions of the world. The first goal was to protect soldiers, but it was widely adopted as a public health device.  In Liberia, for example, the United States had large military operations during the war and the U.S. Public Health Service began the use of DDT for indoor residual spraying (IRS) and as a larvicide, with the goal of controlling malaria in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. In the early 1950s, the project was expanded to nearby villages. In 1953, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) launched an antimalaria program in parts of Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa. However these projects encountered a spate of difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.<ref>James L. A.

''Plasmodium cynomolgi'' in Rhesus monkeys (''[[Macaca mulatta]]'') were used in the 1960s to test drugs active against ''P. vivax''. This model is also still in use.

Genetically modified mice (non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient and BXN) can be engrafted with human stem cells and used as models for ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. Although the model is of variable reproducibility it has been used in some experiments.

Growth of the liver stages in animal free systems has been difficult but was achieved in the 1980s when ''P. berghei'' pre-erythrocytic stages was grown in wI38,a human embryonic lung cell line. This was followed by their growth in the human hepatoma line HepG2. Both ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. vivax'' have been grown in human liver cells; partial development of ''P. ovale'' in human liver cells has also been achieved; and ''P. malariae'' has been grown in chimpanzee and ''[[Night monkey|Aotus]]'' liver cells.

Artemisinin was isolated by Tu Youyou, a Chinese pharmacologist. Tu headed a team of investigators who were tasked by the Chinese government with finding a treatment for choloroquine resistant malaria. Their work was known as Project 523 named after the date it was announced – 23 May 1967. The team investigated >2000 Chinese herb preparations and by 1971 had made 380 extracts from 200 herbs. An extract from qinghao (''[[Artemisia annua]]'') was effective but the results were variable. Tu reviewed the literature including the 340 BC book ''Zhou hou bei ji fang'' (A handbook of prescriptions for emergencies) by the Chinese physician Ge Hong. This book contained the only useful reference to the herb: "A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all." After making a non-toxic, neutral extract, Tu and two team members volunteered to take the extract before antimalarial trials were done in patients. The first studies were published in Chinese with the first English language paper citing successful trials for artemisinin appeared in 1979. The authors of this paper were anonymous according to Chinese custom at the time. Tu presented her findings to a United Nations scientific meeting in Beijing in 1981. Since then artemisinin has become a standard treatment for malaria. 

Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene [[lactone]] containing a [[peroxide]] group, which is believed to be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, in especially, cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance.

As the Rockefeller studies showed in [[Mexico]], DDT remained effective for six to eight weeks if sprayed on the inside walls and ceilings of houses and other buildings.The first field test in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings was carried out in central [[Italy]] in the spring of 1944. The objective was to determine the residual effect of the spray upon anopheline density in the absence of other control measures. Spraying began in [[Castel Volturno]] and, after a few months, in the delta of the [[Tiber]]. The unprecedented effectiveness of the chemical was confirmed: the new [[insecticide]] was able to achieve the eradication of malaria through the eradication of mosquitoes. At the end of World War II a massive malaria control program based on DDT spraying was carried out in Italy. In [[Sardinia]] – the second largest island in the Mediterranean – between 1946 and 1951, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] conducted a large-scale experiment to test the feasibility of the strategy of "species eradication" in an endemic malaria vector.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tognotti E| title = Program to Eradicate Malaria in Sardinia, 1946–1950| journal = Emerg Infect Dis. | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1460–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19788815 |url = http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/9/pdfs/08-1317.pdf | pmc = 2819864 | doi = 10.3201/eid1509.081317 }}</ref> Malaria was effectively eliminated in the United States by the use of DDT in the [[National Malaria Eradication Program]] (1947–52). The concept of eradication prevailed in 1955 in the Eighth [[World Health Assembly]]: DDT was adopted as a primary tool in the fight against malaria.

DDT was banned in the US in 1972, after the discussion opened by the book of the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] which launched the [[Environmental science|environmental]] movement in the West. The book catalogued the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of DDT and suggested that DDT and other [[pesticide]]s may cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to [[wildlife]]. Recently, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], Republicans and Democrats alike, supports [[Indoor residual spraying|indoor DDT spraying]] as a vital component of any successful malaria control program, and the [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in some poor tropical countries.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sadasivaiah S, Tozan Y, Breman JG | title = Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for indoor residual spraying in Africa: how can it be used for malaria control? | journal = Am.

A wide range of other [[insecticide]]s is available for mosquito control in addition to the measures of draining of [[wetland]] breeding grounds and provision of better [[sanitation]]. [[Pyrethrum]] (''[[Chrysanthemum]]'' [or ''[[Tanacetum]]'' ] ''cinerariaefolium'') is an economically important source of natural insecticide. [[Pyrethrin]]s attack the [[nervous system]]s of all insects. A few minutes after application the insect cannot move or fly away and female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Duchon S, Bonnet J, Marcombe S, Zaim M, Corbel V | title = Pyrethrum: a mixture of natural pyrethrins has potential for malaria vector control | journal = J Med Entomol. | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 516–22 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19496422 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/033.046.0316 | doi = 10.1603/033.046.0316 }}</ref> The use of pyrethrum in insecticide preparations dates back to [[Iran|Persia]], about 400 [[Common Era|BCE]]. Pyrethrins are non-persistent, being [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] and also breaking down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of pyrethrin and ''Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium'' comes from [[Kenya]]. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]] during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming and are either dried and powdered or the oils within the flowers are extracted with [[solvent]]s.

=== Cell culture ===
The first successful continuous [[malaria culture]] was established in 1976 by William Trager and James B. Jensen, which facilitated research into the molecular biology of the parasite and the development of new drugs substantially. By using increasing volumes of culture medium, one can grow ''P.falciparum'' to higher parasitemia (above 10%).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Trager W, Jensen JB | title = Human malaria parasites in continuous culture| journal = Science| volume = 193 | issue = 4254 | pages = 673–5 | year = 1976 | pmid = 781840| doi=10.1126/science.781840}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schuster FL | title = Cultivation of Plasmodium spp | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev.| volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–64 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12097244 | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/355 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.3.355-364.2002 | pmc = 118084 }}</ref>

=== Rapid diagnostic tests ===
The use of antigen-based [[Malaria antigen detection tests|malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)]] was pioneered in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ling IT, Cooksley S, Bates PA, Hempelmann E, Wilson RJM | title=Antibodies to the glutamate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum| journal=Parasitology | year=1986 | volume=92 | pages=313–24 | pmid=3086819 | doi=10.1017/S0031182000064088 | issue=2 }}</ref> [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]] [[microscopy]] and RDTs represent the two [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]] most likely to have the largest impact on malaria control today. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria do not require any special equipment and offer the potential to extend accurate malaria diagnosis to areas when microscopy services are not available.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Makler MT, Piper RC| title=Rapid malaria tests: where do we go after 20 years?| journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg| year=2009| volume=81 | pages=921–6 | pmid=19996417|url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/6/921 | doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2009.09-0202 | issue=6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Bisoffi Z, Gobbi F, Angheben A, Van den Ende J| title=The Role of Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Managing Malaria| journal=PLoS Med| year=2009| volume=6 | pages=e1000063 | pmid=19399160|url =http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000063 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000063 | issue=4 | pmc=2667642}}</ref>

==21st century==
Drug resistance poses a growing problem in the treatment of malaria in the 21st century, since resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs, with the exception of the artemisinins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Antimalarial drug resistance |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=113 |issue=8 |pages=1084–92 |year=2004 |pmid=15085184 |pmc=385418 |doi=10.1172/JCI21682}}</ref> This situation has resulted in the treatment of resistant strains becoming increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. However, the artemisinins are expensive, which limits their use in the developing world.<ref name=White2008/> Worrisome evidence is now emerging of malaria on the Cambodia-Thailand border that are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, which raises the possibility that strains of malaria may have evolved that are untreatable with currently available drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wongsrichanalai C, Meshnick SR |title=Declining Artesunate-Mefloquine Efficacy against Falciparum Malaria on the Cambodia–Thailand Border |journal=Emerging Infect.

The application of [[genomics]] to malaria research is now of central importance. With the sequencing of the three [[genome]]s of the malaria parasite ''P.falciparum'', one of its vector ''Anopheles gambiae'', and the [[human genome]], the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can now be studied.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aultman KS, Gottlieb M, Giovanni MY, Fauci AS |title=Anopheles gambiae genome: completing the malaria triad |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5591 |pages=13 |year=2002  |pmid=12364752 |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5591/13 |doi=10.1126/science.298.5591.13}}</ref> This breakthrough is expected to produce advances in the understanding of the interactions between the parasite and its human host—such as between [[virulence factor]]s and the human [[immune system]]—as well as allowing the identification of the factors that restrict one species of parasite to one or a few species of mosquitoes. It is likely that these will eventually lead to new therapeutic approaches.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winzeler EA.|title=Malaria research in the post-genomic era|journal=Nature |volume= 455|issue=7214 |pages= 751–6|year= 2008|pmid=18843360 |doi=10.1038/nature07361 |pmc=2705782 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sahu NK, Sahu S, Kohli DV.|title=Novel molecular targets for antimalarial drug development|journal=Chem Biol Drug Des. |volume= 71|issue= 4 |pages= 287–97|year= 2008|pmid=18298458 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00640.x}}</ref>
Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] mosquitoes that are unable to transmit malaria, allowing [[biological control]] of malaria transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ito J, Ghosh A, Moreira LA, Wimmer EA, Jacobs-Lorena M |title=Transgenic anopheline mosquitoes impaired in transmission of a malaria parasite |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6887 |pages=452–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12024215 |doi=10.1038/417452a}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends [[Indoor residual spraying]] as one of three primary means of malaria control, the others being use of [[Mosquito net|insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs)]] and prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The use of ITNs to prevent malaria has been recommended by [[Giving What We Can]] as one of the most cost-effective means of combating the disease. For example, interventions such as [[Against Malaria Foundation]] are able to prevent malaria-related deaths at $1,600 per person, with one malaria net costing $5.<ref name="Recommended interventions">
{{cite web | title = Recommended interventions by Giving What We Can | url = http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities#amf}}</ref>
In 2000, only 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in stable malaria-endemic conditions were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs by 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Noor AM, Mutheu JJ, Tatem AJ, Hay SI, Snow RW|title= Insecticide-treated net coverage in Africa: mapping progress in 2000–07 |journal=Lancet |volume=373|issue=9657 |pages=58–67|year=2009 |pmid=19019422 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61596-2 |pmc= 2652031}}</ref> An increased percentage of African households (31%) are estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008 (WHO World Malaria Report 2009). Most nets are impregnated with [[pyrethroid]]s, a class of insecticides with particularly low [[toxicity]]. [[Dow AgroSciences]] developed a microencapsulated formulation of the [[organophosphate]] chlorpyrifos methyl as a cost-effective, long-lasting alternative to DDT. As an Indoor residual spraying against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes chlorpyrifos methyl outperformed DDT and [[Cyhalothrin|lambdacyhalothrin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= N'guessan R, Boko P, Odjo A, Chabi J, Akogbeto M, Rowland M|title= Control of pyrethroid and DDT-resistant Anopheles gambiae by application of indoor residual spraying or mosquito nets treated with a long-lasting organophosphate insecticide, chlorpyrifos-methyl |journal=Malar J |volume=9|issue=1 |pages=44|year=2010 |pmid=20141626 |url= http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-9-44.pdf |doi= 10.1186/1475-2875-9-44 |pmc= 2831012}}</ref>  Organizations such as the [[Clinton Foundation]] continue to supply anti-malarial drugs to Africa and other affected areas; according to director [[Inder Singh (philanthropist)|Inder Singh]], in 2011 more than 12 million individuals will be supplied with subsidized anti-malarial drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hst.mit.edu/servlet/ControllerServlet?handler=PublicHandler&action=browse&pageId=2261 |title=BEP grad Inder Singh orchestrates affordable malaria drug development|author=Harvard-MIT Health Sciences|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>  Other organizations, such as [[Malaria No More]] continue distribution of more broad-based prophylaxis.
