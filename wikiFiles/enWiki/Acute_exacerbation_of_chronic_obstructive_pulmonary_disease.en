An '''acute exacerbation of COPD''' is a sudden worsening of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] symptoms (shortness of breath, quantity and color of [[phlegm]]) that typically lasts for several days. It may be triggered by an infection with bacteria or viruses or by environmental pollutants. Typically, infections cause 75% or more of the exacerbations; bacteria can roughly be found in 25% of cases, viruses in another 25%, and both viruses and bacteria in another 25%. Airway inflammation is increased during the exacerbation resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory air flow and worsening of gas transfer.<ref name="pmid17507545">{{cite journal |author=Rabe KF, Hurd S, Anzueto A, ''et al.'' |title=Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: GOLD Executive Summary |journal=Am.

In absence of concomitant presence of [[emphysema]], the underlying condition may be classified as [[chronic bronchitis]] alone, and the exacerbations are then termed "[[acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis]]" (AECB), and shares many characteristics with that of acute exacerbation of COPD.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As COPD progresses, exacerbations tend to become more frequent, the average being about three episodes per year.<ref name=merck>http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec05/ch049/ch049a.html#sec05-ch049-ch049a-423</ref>

== Causes ==

As the lungs tend to be vulnerable organs due to their exposure to harmful particles in the air, several things can cause an acute exacerbation of COPD.

*[[Respiratory infection]], being responsible for approximately half of COPD exacerbations. Approximately half of these are due to viral infections and another half appears to be caused by bacterial infections.<ref name=uppsala>Uppsala Academic Hospital > Guidelines for treatment of acute lung diseases. August 2004. Authors: Christer Hanson, Carl-Axel Karlsson, Mary Kämpe, Kristina Lamberg, Eva Lindberg, Lavinia Machado Boman, Gunnemar Stålenheim</ref>
*[[Air pollution]]
*[[Pulmonary embolism]]
*Failing to follow a [[Drug therapy]] program, e.g. improper use of an [[Inhaler]]

In one-third of all COPD exacerbation cases, the cause cannot be identified.

Although the condition of a patient with COPD can become exacerbated by many other factors as well, the scope is generally restricted to the ones that cause the symptoms below.

== Signs and symptoms ==

For the most part, symptoms of a COPD exacerbation will remain of the same variations experienced in COPD patients, but will be worsened due to environmental and other factors. These may include, but are not limited to: an increased amount of [[cough]] and [[sputum]] productions from usual day-to-day variations. This may be accompanied by a change in the usual appearance of the sputum produced. Other symptoms include increased [[wheezing]], [[fever]] and a sensation of tightness in the chest.

An abrupt worsening in COPD symptoms may cause rupture of the airways in the [[human lungs|lungs]], which in turn may cause a spontaneous [[pneumothorax]].<ref name=merck/>

==Prevention==
Acute exacerbations can be partially prevented. Some infections can be prevented by vaccination against pathogens such as influenza and ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''. Regular medication use can prevent some COPD exacerbations; [[long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist]]s (LABAs), long-acting anticholinergics, [[inhaled corticosteroid]]s and low-dose theophylline have all been shown to reduce the frequency of  COPD exacerbations.<ref name="pmid17314337">{{cite journal |author=Calverley PM, Anderson JA, Celli B, ''et al.'' |title=Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=N.

==Treatment==

===Oxygen===
High flow oxygen may be harmful in those with an acute exacerbation of COPD. In the prehospital environment those given high flow O<sub>2</sub> rather that titrating their O<sub>2</sub> sats to 88% to 92% had worse outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Austin MA, Wills KE, Blizzard L, Walters EH, Wood-Baker R |title=Effect of high flow oxygen on mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in prehospital setting: randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=341 |issue= |pages=c5462 |year=2010 |pmid=20959284 |pmc=2957540 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5462|url=}}</ref>

===Medications===
The symptoms of acute exacerbations are treated using short-acting bronchodilators. A course of corticosteroids, usually in tablet or intravenous rather than inhaled form, can speed up recovery.<ref name="pmid17507545" />  The iv and oral forms of steroids have been found to be equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lindenauer PK, Pekow PS, Lahti MC, Lee Y, Benjamin EM, Rothberg MB |title=Association of corticosteroid dose and route of administration with risk of treatment failure in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=23 |pages=2359–67 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20551406 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.796 |url=}}</ref> Antibiotics are often used but will only help if the exacerbation is due to an infection.<ref>Gibson, et al.

Examples of first-line antibiotics are [[amoxicillin]],<ref name=uppsala/> [[doxycycline]]<ref name=uppsala/> and [[co-trimoxazole]].<ref name=uppsala/>

===Mechanical ventilation===
Severe exacerbations can require hospital care where treatments such as oxygen and [[mechanical ventilation]] may be required.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Quon BS, Gan WQ, Sin DD |title=Contemporary management of acute exacerbations of COPD: a systematic review and metaanalysis |journal=Chest |volume=133 |issue=3 |pages=756–66 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18321904 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-1207}}</ref> Mechanical ventilation can be invasive([[Endotracheal intubation]]) or non-invasive forms of ventilation such as [[Continuous positive airway pressure]].

== Ambiguous definitions ==

The definition of a COPD exacerbation is commonly described as "lost in translation,"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makris D, Bouros D |title=COPD Exacerbtion: Lost in Translation |journal=BMC Pulm Med |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages= 6|year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19178701 |doi=10.1186/1471-2466-9-6 |pmc=2640343}}</ref> meaning that there is no universally accepted standard with regard to defining an acute exacerbation of COPD. Many organizations consider it a priority to create such a standard, as it would be a major step forward in the diagnosis and quality of treatment of COPD.
