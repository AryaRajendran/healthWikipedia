In humans, the '''sacrum''' (plural: ''sacrums'' or ''sacra'') is a large, triangular [[bone]] at the base of the [[vertebral column|spine]] and at the upper and back part of the [[pelvic cavity]], where it is [[Insertion (anatomy)|inserted]] like a wedge between the two [[hip bones]]. Its upper part connects with the last [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar vertebra]], and bottom part with the [[coccyx]] (tailbone).  It consists of usually five initially unfused vertebrae which begin to fuse between ages 16–18 and are usually completely fused into a single bone by age 34.

It is curved upon itself and placed obliquely (that is, tilted forward). It is [[Kyphosis (disambiguation)|kyphotic]]—that is, [[wikt:concave|concave]] facing forward. The base projects forward as the [[sacral promontory]] internally, and articulates with the last lumbar vertebra to form the prominent [[sacrovertebral angle]]. The central part is curved outward toward the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]], allowing greater room for the [[pelvic cavity]]. The two lateral projections of the sacrum are called ala (wings), and articulate with the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] at the L-shaped sacroiliac joints.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''(os) sacrum'', (''sacer, sacra, sacrum'', "[[sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]]"), a translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''hieron (osteon)'', meaning sacred or strong bone.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sacrum Online Etymology Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is called so either because supposedly sacrum was the part of an animal offered in sacrifice ( since the sacrum is the seat of the [[reproductive organs|organs of procreation]]) or because of the belief that the soul of the man resides there . In [[Slavic languages]] and in [[German language|German]] this bone is called the 'cross bone' (Kreuzbein),<ref>[http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&lang=en&searchLoc=0&cmpType=relaxed&sectHdr=on&spellToler=std&search=sacrum&relink=on LEO E-G Results for "sacrum"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in Dutch 'holy bone' (Heiligbeen).

==Parts==
* The [[pelvic surface of sacrum|pelvic surface of the sacrum]] is concave from above downward, and slightly so from side to side.
* The [[dorsal surface of sacrum|dorsal surface of the sacrum]] is convex and narrower than the pelvic.
* The [[lateral surface of sacrum|lateral surface of the sacrum]] is broad above, but narrowed into a thin edge below.
* The [[base of the sacrum]], which is broad and expanded, is directed upward and forward.
* The apex (''apex oss. sacri'') is directed downward, and presents an oval facet for articulation with the [[coccyx]].
* The [[vertebral canal]] (''canalis sacralis''; sacral canal) runs throughout the greater part of the bone; above, it is triangular in form; below, its posterior wall is incomplete, from the non-development of the laminae and spinous processes. It lodges the [[sacral nerve]]s, and its walls are perforated by the anterior and posterior sacral foramina through which these nerves pass out.

== Articulations ==

The sacrum articulates with four bones:
* the last [[lumbar vertebra]] above
* the [[coccyx|coccyx (tailbone)]] below
* the [[Ilium (bone)|illium]] portion of the [[hip bone]] on either side

Rotation of the sacrum infero-posteriorly a few degrees vis-à-vis the [[ilium (bone)|ilia]] is sometimes called "nutation" (from the Latin term [[wikt:nutatio|nutatio]] which means "nodding") and the reverse, antero-superiorly motion, "counter-nutation."<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph D. Kurnik, DC|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/14/26/18.html|title=The AS Ilium Fixation, Nutation, and Respect}}</ref>
In upright vertebrates, the sacrum is capable of slight independent movement along the [[sagittal plane]]. When you bend backward the top (base) of the sacrum moves forward relative to the ilium; when you bend forward the top moves back.<ref>Maitland, J (2001). ''Spinal Manipulation Made Simple.'' Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>

The ''sacrum'' is called so when referred to all of the parts combined. Its parts are called  ''sacral vertebrae'' when referred individually.

== Sexual dimorphism ==

The sacrum is noticeably [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] (differently shaped in males and females).

In the female the sacrum is shorter and wider than in the male; the lower half forms a greater angle with the upper; the upper half is nearly straight, the lower half presenting the greatest amount of curvature. The bone is also directed more obliquely backward; this increases the size of the pelvic cavity and renders the sacrovertebral angle more prominent.

In the male the curvature is more evenly distributed over the whole length of the bone, and is altogether larger than in the female.

== Variations ==

In some cases the sacrum will consist of six pieces [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/akramjfr/sacralization.html&date=2009-10-25+12:10:24] or be reduced in number to four [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/akramjfr/lumbarization.html&date=2009-10-25+12:10:08]. The bodies of the first and second vertebrae may fail to unite.

Sometimes the uppermost transverse tubercles are not joined to the rest of the ala on one or both sides, or the sacral canal may be open throughout a considerable part of its length, in consequence of the imperfect development of the laminae and spinous processes.

The sacrum also varies considerably with respect to its degree of curvature.
