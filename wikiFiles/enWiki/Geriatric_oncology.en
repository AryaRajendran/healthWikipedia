'''Geriatric oncology''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that studies [[Benign tumor|benign]] and [[Cancer|malignant]] [[tumors]] in [[elderly]].

== Origin ==
While anyone can develop [[cancer]], the risk of getting the disease increases with age. Certain cancers, in particular, are linked to aging, such as breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, bladder and stomach cancers. 

For many reasons, older adults (generally age 70 and higher) with cancer have different needs than younger adults with the disease. Treatment for older adults needs to consider many issues. 
For example, older adults:<ref>[http://www.froedtert.com/SpecialtyAreas/CancerCenter/ProgramsandServices/GeriatricOncology.htm Geriatric oncology specialists]</ref><ref>[http://my.clevelandclinic.org/cancer/treatment/department/geriatric_oncology_clinic.aspx Cleveland Clinic,Geriatric oncology clinic]</ref>  
* May be less able to tolerate certain cancer treatments.
* Have a decreased reserve (the capacity to respond to disease and treatment).
* May have other medical problems in addition to cancer.
* May have functional problems, such as the ability to do basic activities (dressing, bathing, eating) or more advanced activities (such as using transportation, going shopping or handling finances).
* May not always have access to transportation, social support or financial resources.

[[Cancer]] and other tumors are common among elderly. Elderly have many peculiarities as regard dosing, complications and tolerance of treatment options of cancer. [[Clinical trials]] that [[guidelines]] for treatment of cancer were based on were mainly applied for young age and rarely in elders, so a lot of research in this area is needed.

Just as a child would see a [[pediatrician]] for medical care, an older patient should go to a [[geriatrician]]. And an older patient with cancer will benefit from the combined expertise of the Geriatric [[Oncology]] Program’s physician experts. Older patients have unique needs because of their often complex medical histories, numerous drugs they are taking, their social situations, possible problems with cognitive dysfunction related to age, and general diminution of organ function that occurs naturally in the older population. An expert in geriatrics, working in conjunction with a medical oncologist sensitive to these problems, can decide on the appropriate treatment for any elderly cancer patient.<ref name=org>[http://www.geriatriconcology.org/ Geriatric oncology org]</ref>

One of a handful of people around the world who created the field of geriatric oncology during the 1980s was Lodovico Balducci. He was co-editor of the first major medial textbook on the subject, ''Geriatric Oncology'', published in 1982, and has been honored with the B.J. Kennedy Award for Scientific Excellence in Geriatric Oncology from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.<ref name=cr>[http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/spring%202009/Pages/PersonalizedMedicine.aspx Kevin Begos, "Personalized Medicine", ''CR Magazine'', Spring 2009]</ref>

== Training & education programs ==
These Programs aims at providing optimal cancer care for senior adults aged 70 and older, and helps patients overcome the special challenges this population faces in battling the disease.<ref name=org/> Separate fellowships for training in geriatric oncology subspeciality is now established.<ref>[http://www.bmc.org/geriatrics/educationFellows_GeriOncology_CurrDesc.htm Fellowship in Geriatric Oncology - Curriculum Description]</ref> Books and curriculum are available for training.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/9057022257 Comprehensive Geriatric Oncology Book]</ref>

All new patients meet with a medical oncologist, a geriatrician, a psychosocial professional, and a nutritionist, all of whom work together to provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s [[physical fitness|fitness]] to withstand the therapy necessary to treat his or her cancer. Patients spend approximately three hours with the Geriatric Oncology Program team. Following the initial assessment, the team meets to evaluate the patient’s fitness for therapy. The team’s decisions and recommendations are then presented to the patient and his or her family as well as to the patient’s primary physician when appropriate. After these discussions, treatment for the patient’s cancer is initiated.<ref name="org"/>

== Organisation & societies ==
Geriatric Oncology [[Consortium]] is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to addressing the age based disparities in research, education and treatment in the older adult cancer population. It is leader in developing and conducting research in older adults and  providing older adult cancer education to medical professionals, patients, caregivers and the general public.<ref>[http://www.thegoc.org/ Geriatric Oncology Consortium]</ref>

The [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] (ASCO) has started a geriatric oncology subspeciality. A webpage didicated to article and resources about geriatric oncology is available.<ref>[http://geriatricsca.asco.org/ Geriatric oncology at ASCO]</ref>

World oncology network has established a directory for geriatric oncology to promote this subspeciality.<ref>[http://www.worldoncology.net/geriatrics.htm World oncology network, Geriatric oncology]</ref>

The '''International Society of Geriatric Oncology'''[http://www.siog.org] or Société Internationale d’Oncologie Gériatrique in French, hence the acronym SIOG, was founded in 2000 and was officially registered as a Not-for-profit organisation under the Swiss law in October 2012. SIOG is a multidisciplinary society, including physicians in the fields of oncology and geriatrics, and allied health professionals and has over 1000 members in more than 40 countries around the world.
The major risk factor for cancer is age, and with the aging of the world population, a major epidemiologic challenge is before us.
The goal of SIOG is to foster the development of health professionals in the field of geriatric oncology, in order to optimize treatment of older adults with cancer.
SIOG promotes efforts in 3 strategic directions:

'''1. Education''' 
- Disseminate knowledge in order to maintain a high common standard of healthcare in older cancer patients
- Integrate geriatric oncology in the curricula for medical and nursing education to ensure a high standard of qualification for healthcare professionals 
- Address the shortage of specialist oncologists/geriatricians & allied health staff in geriatric oncology 
- Increase public awareness of the worldwide cancer in the elderly epidemic

'''2. Clinical practice''' 
- Integrate geriatric evaluation (including co morbidities) into oncology decision-making and guidelines 
- Improve the quality of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of older patients with malignancies 
- Address issues of access to care, including the needs of the caregiver 
- Develop interdisciplinary geriatric oncology clinics 

'''3. Research''' 
- Develop, test and disseminate easy screening tools
- Create a clear and operational definition of vulnerability/frailty applicable to oncology 
- Increase the relevance of clinical trials for older patients 
- Improve research in the field of geriatric oncology 
- Promote multidisciplinary, basic/translational research on the interface of aging and cancer
