'''Sex steroids''', also known as '''gonadal steroids''', are [[steroid hormone]]s that interact with [[vertebrate]] [[androgen]] or [[estrogen]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s.<ref>Guerriero G. :)Vertebrate sex steroid receptors: evolution, ligands, and neurodistribution. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 April; 1163:154-68. Review. PMID 19456336</ref> Their effects are mediated by slow genomic mechanisms through [[nuclear receptor]]s as well as by fast nongenomic mechanisms through membrane-associated receptors and [[signaling cascade]]s.<ref>Thakur MK, Paramanik V. Role of steroid hormone coregulators in health and disease. Horm Res. 2009; 71(4):194-200. Epub 2009 March 4. Review. PMID 19258710</ref> The term '''''sex hormone''''' is nearly always synonymous with ''sex steroid''. The non-steroid hormones [[luteinizing hormone]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] are usually not regarded as sex hormones, although they play major sex-related roles.

==Production==
Natural sex steroids are made by the [[gonad]]s ([[ovary|ovaries]] or [[testes]]),<ref>Brook CG. Mechanism of puberty. Horm Res. 1999;51 Suppl 3:52-4. Review. PMID 10592444</ref> by [[adrenal gland]]s, or by conversion from other sex steroids in other tissue such as liver or fat.

==Synthetic sex steroids==
There are also many synthetic sex steroids. Synthetic androgens are often referred to as [[anabolic steroid]]s. Synthetic estrogens and progestins are used in methods of [[hormonal contraception]]. [[Ethinylestradiol]] is a semi-synthetic estrogen. Specific compounds that have partial agonist activity for [[steroid receptors]], and therefore act in part like natural steroid hormones, are in use in medical conditions that require treatment with steroid in one cell type, but where systemic effects of the particular steroid in the entire organism are only desirable within certain limits.<ref>Copland JA, Sheffield-Moore M, Koldzic-Zivanovic N, Gentry S, Lamprou G, Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F, Zoumpourlis V, Urban RJ, Vlahopoulos SA. Sex steroid receptors in skeletal differentiation and epithelial neoplasia: is tissue-specific intervention possible? Bioessays. 2009 Jun;31(6):629-41. Review. PMID 19382224</ref>

==Types==
In many contexts, the two main classes of sex steroids are androgens and estrogens, of which the most important human derivatives are [[testosterone]] and [[estradiol]], respectively. Other contexts will include [[progestogen]]s as a third class of sex steroids, distinct from androgens and estrogens. [[Progesterone]] is the most important and only naturally-occurring human progestogen. In general, androgens are considered "male sex hormones", since they have masculinizing effects, while estrogens and progestogens are considered "female sex hormones"<ref>[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0765.1974.tb00683.x Comparative metabolism of female sex steroids in normal and chronically inflamed gingiva of the dog] T.
