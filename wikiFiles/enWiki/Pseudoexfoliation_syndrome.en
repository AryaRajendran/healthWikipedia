==History==
[[File:Slit lamp Eye examination by Ophthalmologist.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Lindberg in 1917 built his own slit lamp to study pseudoexfoliation syndrome. A slit lamp in an ophthalmology clinic in recent times.]]
Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) was first described by an [[ophthalmologist]] from [[Finland]] named John Lindberg in 1917.<ref name="KarimFDamji2007">{{cite journal|last=Damji |first=Karim F. |year=2007 |month=October |title=Progress in understanding pseudoexfoliation syndrome and pseudoexfoliation-associated glaucoma |journal=Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=657â€“658 |url=http://pubservices.nrc-cnrc.ca/rp-ps/absres.jsp?jcode=cjo&ftl=i07-158&lang=eng |doi=10.3129/I07-158 |accessdate=2009-04-19|pmid=17891191}}</ref><ref name=twsO17/> He built his own [[slit lamp]] to study the condition and reported "grey flakes on the lens capsule", as well as [[glaucoma]] in 50% of the eyes, and an "increasing prevalence of the condition with age."<ref name=twsE43/> Several decades later, an ocular pathologist named Georgiana Dvorak-Theobald suggested the term ''pseudo''exfoliation to distinguish it from a similar ailment which sometimes affected [[glassblower]]s called ''true exfoliation'' syndrome. The latter ailment is caused by heat or "infrared-related changes in the anterior lens capsule" and is characterized by "lamellar delamination of the lens capsule."<ref name=twsO17/> Sometimes the two terms "pseudoexfoliation" and "true exfoliation" are used interchangeably<ref name=twsE43/> but the more precise usage is to treat each case separately.

==Symptoms==
Patients may have no specific symptoms.<ref name=twsO17/> In some cases, patients may complain of lessened visual acuity or changes in their perceived visual field, and such changes may be secondary to or different from symptoms normally associated with [[cataract]]s or [[glaucoma]].<ref name=twsO17/>

PEX is characterized by tiny microscopic white<ref name="KarimFDamji2007"/> or grey<ref name=twsE43/> granular flakes<ref name=twsO17/> which are clumps of proteins within the eye which look somewhat like [[dandruff]] when seen through a microscope and which are released by cells.<ref name=twsO21>{{cite news

PEX can become problematic when the flakes become enmeshed in a "spongy area" known as the [[trabecular meshwork]] and block its normal functioning,<ref name=twsU112/> and may interact with degenerative changes in the [[Schlemm's canal]] and the juxtacanalicular area.<ref name=twsO17/> The blockage leads to greater-than-normal elevated [[intraocular pressure]]<ref name=twsU112/> which, in turn, can damage the [[optic nerve]].<ref name=twsO21/> The eye produces a clear fluid called the [[aqueous humor]] which subsequently drains such that there is a constant level of safe pressure within the eye, but glaucoma can result if this normal outflow of fluid is blocked.<ref name=twsO21/> [[Glaucoma]] is an umbrella term indicating ailments which damage the neural cable from the eye to the brain called the [[optic nerve]], and which can lead to a loss of vision.<ref name=twsO21/> In most cases of glaucoma, typically called ''primary open-angle glaucoma'', the outflow does not happen normally but doctors can not see what is causing the blockage; with PEX, however, the flakes are believed to be a cause of the blockage.<ref name=twsO21/> PEX flakes by themselves do not directly ''cause'' glaucoma, but can cause glaucoma indirectly by blocking the outflow of aqueous humor, which leads to higher intraocular pressure, and this can cause glaucoma.<ref name=twsO17/> PEX has been known to cause a weakening of structures within the eye which help hold the eye's lens in place, called lens zonules.<ref name=twsU112/>

==Diagnosis==
PEX is usually diagnosed by an eye doctor who examines the eye using a microscope. The method is termed [[slit lamp]] examination and it is done with an "85% sensitivity rate and a 100% specificity rate."<ref name=twsO17/> Since the symptom of increased pressure within the eye is generally painless until the condition becomes rather advanced, it is possible for people afflicted with glaucoma to be in danger yet not be aware of it.<ref name=twsO21/> As a result, it is recommended that persons have regular [[eye examination]]s to have their levels of [[intraocular pressure]] measured, so that treatments can be prescribed before there is any serious damage to the [[optic nerve]] and subsequent loss of [[visual perception|vision]].<ref name=twsO21/>

==Causes==
The cause or [[etiology]] of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is generally unknown.<ref name=twsO21/><ref name=twsO17/><ref name=twsU112/>

PEX is generally believed to be a systemic disorder,<ref name=twsO17/><ref name=twsE43/><ref name=twsU112/> possibly of the basement membrane of the eye.<ref name=twsU112/> Researchers have noticed deposits of PEX material in various parts of the body, including in the skin, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and elsewhere.<ref name=twsE43/> Nevertheless, what is puzzling is that PEX tends to happen in only one eye first, which scientists call ''unilaterality'',<ref name=twsU112>{{cite news

==Prevalence==
Scientists are studying different populations and relationships to try to learn more about the disease. They have found associations with different groups but it is not yet clear what the underlying factors are and how they affect different peoples around the world.

* '''Glaucoma patients'''. While PEX and glaucoma are believed to be related, there are cases of persons with PEX without glaucoma, and persons with glaucoma without PEX.<ref name=twsO17/> Generally, a person with PEX is considered as having a risk of developing glaucoma, and vice versa. One study suggested that the PEX was present in 12% of glaucoma patients.<ref name=twsO17/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Roth M, Epstein DL | year = 1980 | title = Exfoliation syndrome | url = | journal = Am J Ophthalmol | volume = 89 | issue = 4| pages = 477â€“81 |pmid=7369310}}</ref> Another found that PEX was present in 6% of an "open-angle glaucoma" group.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cashwell LF Jr, Shields MB | year = 1988 | title = Exfoliation syndrome in the southeastern United States.

* '''Other diseases'''. Sometimes PEX is associated with the development of medical problems other than merely glaucoma.

==Treatment==
[[File:Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma EDA11.JPG|thumb|right|Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the meshwork. This new opening helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure.]]
While PEX itself is untreatable as of 2011, it is possible for doctors to minimize the damage to vision and to the optic nerves by the same medical techniques used to prevent glaucoma.

* '''Eyedrops'''. This is usually the first treatment method. [[Eyedrops]] can help reduce intraocular pressure within the eye.<ref name=twsO21/> The medications within the eyedrops can include [[beta blocker]]s (such as levobunolol or timolol) which slow the production of the aqueous humor.<ref name=twsO21/> And other medications can increase its outflow, such as prostaglandin analogues (e.g. latanoprost).<ref name=twsO21/> And these medicines can be used in various combinations.<ref name=twsO21/> In most cases of glaucoma, eyedrops alone will suffice to solve the problem.

* '''Laser surgery'''. A further treatment is a type of laser therapy known as [[trabeculoplasty]] in which a high-energy laser beam is pointed at the trabecular meshwork to cause it to "remodel and open" and improve the outflows of the aqueous humor. These can be done as an [[outpatient procedure]] and take less than twenty minutes. One report suggests this procedure is usually effective.<ref name=twsU112/>

[[File:Trabectome Removes Damaged Trabecular Meshwork.jpg|thumb|right|In a surgical procedure called [[trabectome]], the trabecular meshwork is removed to help glaucoma patients.]]
* '''Eye surgery'''. Surgery is the treatment method of last resort if the other methods have not worked. It is usually effective at preventing glaucoma.<ref name=twsU112/> Eye surgery on PEX patients can be subject to [[medical complication]]s if the fibers which hold the lens have become weakened because of a buildup from the flakes; if the lens-holding fibers have weakened, then the lens may become loose, and complications from eye surgery may result.<ref name=twsO21/> In such cases, it is recommended that surgeons act quickly to repair the phacodonesis before the lenses have dropped.<ref name=twsU111>{{cite news

* '''Drug therapy'''. There are speculations that if genetics plays a role in PEX, and if the specific genes involved can be identified, that possibly drugs can be developed to counteract these mutations or their effects.<ref name=twsE43/> But such drugs have not been developed as of 2011.

Patients should continue to have regular eye examinations so that physicians can monitor pressure levels and check whether medicines are working.

==Research==
Scientists and doctors are actively exploring how PEX happens, its causes, and how it might be prevented or mitigated. Research activity to explore what causes glaucoma has been characterized as "intense".<ref name=twsO21/> There has been research into the genetic basis of PEX. One researcher speculated about a possible "two-hit hypothesis" in which a single mutation in the LOXL1 gene puts people at risk for PEX, but that a second still-to-be-found mutation has some effect on the proteins, possibly affecting bonds between chemicals, such that the proteins are more likely to clump together and disrupt the outflow of aqueous humor.<ref name=twsE43/>
