'''Boron trifluoride''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]]  BF<sub>3</sub>.  This pungent colourless [[toxic]] gas forms white fumes in moist air.  It is a useful [[Lewis acid]] and a versatile building block for other [[boron]] compounds.

==Structure and bonding==
The geometry of a  [[molecule]] of BF<sub>3</sub> is [[trigonal planar]].  Its D<sub>3h</sub> [[symmetry group|symmetry]] conforms with the prediction of [[VSEPR theory]].  The molecule has no dipole moment by virtue of its high symmetry.  The molecule is [[isoelectronic]] with the carbonate anion, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>. 

BF<sub>3</sub> is commonly referred to as "[[electron deficiency|electron deficient]]," a description that is reinforced by its [[exothermic]] reactivity toward [[Lewis base]]s.

In the boron trihalides, BX<sub>3</sub>, the length of the B-F bonds (1.30 Å) is shorter than would be expected for single bonds,<ref name=greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref> and this shortness may indicate stronger B-X [[pi bond|π-bonding]] in the fluoride.  A facile explanation invokes the symmetry-allowed overlap of a p orbital on the boron atom with the in-phase combination of the three similarly oriented p orbitals on fluorine atoms.<ref name = greenwood/>

[[File:Boron-trifluoride-pi-bonding-2D.png|100px|Boron trifluoride pi bonding diagram]]

==Synthesis and handling==
BF<sub>3</sub> is manufactured by the reaction of boron oxides with [[hydrogen fluoride]]:
:B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>  +  6 HF  →  2 BF<sub>3</sub>  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O
Typically the HF is produced ''in situ'' from sulfuric acid and [[fluorite]] (CaF<sub>2</sub>).<ref>{{cite book | author = Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-12-352651-5 }}</ref> Approximately 2300-4500 tonnes of boron trifluoride are produced every year.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann | title = Boron Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_309 | author = Brotherton, R. J.; Weber, C. J.; Guibert, C. R.; Little, J. L. }}</ref>

On a laboratory scale, BF<sub>3</sub> is produced by the thermal decomposition of diazonium salts:<ref>{{ OrgSynth | author = Flood, D. T. | title = Fluorobenzene | year = 1933 | volume = 13 | pages = 46 | collvol = 2 | collvolpages = 295 | prep = CV2P0295 }}</ref>
:PhN<sub>2</sub>BF<sub>4</sub>  →  [[Fluorobenzene|PhF]]  +  BF<sub>3</sub>  +  [[nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]]

Anhydrous boron trifluoride has a [[boiling point]] of &minus;100.3 C and a critical temperature of &minus;12.3 C, so that it can be stored as a refrigerated liquid only between those temperatures. Storage or transport vessels should be designed to withstand internal pressure, since a refrigeration system failure could cause pressures to rise to the critical pressure of 49.85 bar (4.985 MPa).<ref>{{cite book | editor = Yaws, C. L. | title = Chemical Properties Handbook | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1999 | page = 25 }}</ref> 

Boron trifluoride is corrosive. Suitable metals for equipment handling boron trifluoride include [[stainless steel]], [[monel]], and [[hastelloy]]. In presence of moisture it corrodes steel, including stainless steel. It reacts with [[polyamide]]s. [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]], [[polychlorotrifluoroethylene]], [[polyvinylidene fluoride]], and [[polypropylene]] show satisfactory resistance. The [[grease (lubricant)#Laboratory grease|grease]] used in the equipment should be [[fluorocarbon]] based, as boron trifluoride reacts with the hydrocarbon-based ones.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Air Liquide]] | url = http://encyclopedia.airliquide.com/encyclopedia.asp?GasID=68 | work = Gas Encyclopedia | title = Boron trifluoride }}</ref>

==Reactions==
Unlike the aluminium and gallium trihalides, the boron trihalides are all monomeric.  They undergo rapid halide exchange reactions:
:BF<sub>3</sub>  +  [[boron trichloride|BCl<sub>3</sub>]]  →  BF<sub>2</sub>Cl  +  BCl<sub>2</sub>F
Because of the facility of this exchange process, the mixed halides cannot be obtained in pure form.

Boron trifluoride is a versatile Lewis acid that forms [[adduct]]s with such [[Lewis base]]s as [[fluoride]] and [[ether]]s:
:[[Caesium fluoride|CsF]]  +  BF<sub>3</sub>  →  CsBF<sub>4</sub>
:[[Diethyl ether|O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]]  +  BF<sub>3</sub>  →  BF<sub>3</sub>O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>

[[Tetrafluoroborate]] salts are commonly employed as [[non-coordinating anion]]s.  The adduct with [[diethyl ether]], '''boron trifluoride diethyl etherate''' or just '''boron trifluoride etherate''' (BF<sub>3</sub> · O(Et)<sub>2</sub>) is a conveniently handled [[liquid]] and consequently is a widely encountered as a laboratory source of BF<sub>3</sub>. It is stable as a solution in ether, but not stoichiometrically. Another common adduct is the adduct with [[dimethyl sulfide]] (BF<sub>3</sub> · S(Me)<sub>2</sub>), which can be handled as a neat liquid.

===Comparative Lewis acidity===
All three lighter boron trihalides, BX<sub>3</sub> (X = F, Cl, Br) form stable adducts with common Lewis bases.  Their relative Lewis acidities can be evaluated in terms of the relative exothermicities of the adduct-forming reaction. Such measurements have revealed the following sequence for the Lewis acidity:

:BF<sub>3</sub> < BCl<sub>3</sub> < BBr<sub>3</sub> (strongest Lewis acid)

This trend is commonly attributed to the degree of [[pi bond|π-bonding]] in the planar boron trihalide that would be lost upon pyramidalization of the BX<sub>3</sub> molecule.<ref>{{Cotton&Wilkinson6th }}</ref> which follows this trend:

:BF<sub>3</sub> > BCl<sub>3</sub> > BBr<sub>3</sub> (most easily pyramidalized)

The criteria for evaluating the relative strength of [[pi bond|π-bonding]] are not clear, however.<ref name = greenwood/> One suggestion is that the F atom is small compared to the larger Cl and Br atoms, and the lone pair electron in p<sub>z</sub> of F is readily and easily donated and overlapped to empty p<sub>z</sub> orbital of boron. As a result, the pi donation of F is greater than that of Cl or Br. 

In an alternative explanation, the low Lewis acidity for BF<sub>3</sub> is attributed to the relative weakness of the bond in the adducts F<sub>3</sub>B-L.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Boorman, P. M.; Potts, D. | title = Group V Chalcogenide Complexes of Boron Trihalides | journal = [[Canadian Journal of Chemistry]] | year = 1974 | volume = 52 | issue = 11 | pages = 2016–2020 | doi = 10.1139/v74-291 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Brinck, T.; Murray, J.

===Hydrolysis===
Boron trifluoride reacts with water to give [[boric acid]] and [[fluoroboric acid]]. The reaction commences with the formation of the aquo adduct, H<sub>2</sub>O-BF<sub>3</sub>, which then loses HF that gives fluoboric acid with boron trifluoride.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wamser, C. A. | title = Equilibria in the System Boron Trifluoride–Water at 25° | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | year = 1951 | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 409–416 | doi = 10.1021/ja01145a134 }}</ref>

:4 BF<sub>3</sub>  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O  →  3 HBF<sub>4</sub>  +  "B(OH)<sub>3</sub>"

The heavier trihalides do not undergo analogous reactions, possibly the lower stability of the tetrahedral ions BX<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> (X = Cl, Br).  Because of the high acidity of fluoroboric acid, the fluoroborate ion can be used to isolate particularly electrophilic cations, such as [[diazonium]] ions, that are otherwise difficult to isolate as solids. {{see also | tetrafluoroborate}}

==Discovery==
Boron trifluoride was discovered in 1808 by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], who were trying to isolate "fluoric acid" (i.e., [[hydrofluoric acid]]) by combining [[calcium fluoride]] with vitrified [[boric acid]].  The resulting vapours failed to etch glass, so they named it ''fluoboric gas''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gay-Lussac, J. L.; Thénard, L.
