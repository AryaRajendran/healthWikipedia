A '''coronary artery dissection''' (also known as '''spontaneous coronary artery dissection''', or '''SCAD''') is a rare, sometimes fatal traumatic condition, with eighty percent of cases affecting women. The [[coronary artery]] develops a tear, causing blood to flow between the layers which [[Dissection (medical)|forces them apart]].<ref>Robert Slight; Ali Asgar Behranwala; Onyekwelu Nzewi; Rajesh Sivaprakasam; Edward Brackenbury; Pankaj Mankad (2003) [http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/116-1181/585/ "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a report of two cases occurring during menstruation"] ''New Zealand Medical Journal'']</ref>  Early studies of the disease placed mortality rates at around 70%, but more recent evidence suggests a figure of around 20%<ref>Umman, Sabahattin; Olcay, Ayhan; Sezer, Murat; Erdogan, Dogan (2006) "Exercise-induced coronary artery dissection treated with an anticoagulant and antiaggregants" ''The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology''</ref><ref>Monika Juszczyk MD; Thomas Marnejon;  David A. Hoffman; (2004) [http://www.invasivecardiology.com/article/3062 "Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Postpartum"] ''Invasive Cardiology''</ref>  The condition is often seen to be related to female hormone levels, as well as other pre-existing [[cardiovascular]] conditions.  In addition to this, a dissection can occur [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenically]], by the surgical inserion of a [[catheter]] into the coronary artery.<ref name="iatrogenesis"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms are often very similar to those of [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), with the most common being persistent chest pain.<ref>[http://www.invasivecardiology.com/article/3062 "Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Postpartum"]</ref>

==Causes==
===SCAD===
There is evidence to suggest that a major cause of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is related to female [[hormone]] levels, as most cases appear to arise in pre-menopausal women, although there is evidence that the condition can have various triggers; other underlying conditions such as [[hypertension]] may sometimes be causes.<ref>Dhawan R, Singh G, Fesniak H. (2002) "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: the clinical spectrum". ''Angiology''</ref>  There is also a possibility that exercise can be a trigger.  However cases sometimes have no obvious cause.<ref>Mark V. Sherrid; Jennifer Mieres; Allen Mogtader; Naresh Menezes; Gregory Steinberg (1995) "Onset During Exercise of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection and Sudden Death. Occurrence in a Trained Athlete: Case Report and Review of Prior Cases" ''Chest''</ref>

===Iatrogenesis===
It has been recognised that some instances are [[iatrogenic]], as it can be caused by the insertion of a [[catheter]] into the coronary artery.<ref name="iatrogenesis">Andrew Boyle; Michael Chan; Joud Dib; Jon Resar (2006) "Catheter-Induced Coronary Artery Dissection: Risk Factors, Prevention and Management" ''Inavasive Cardiology''</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Coronary artery dissection results from a tear in the inner layer of the artery, the [[tunica intima]].  This allows blood to penetrate and cause an intramural [[hematoma]] in the central layer, the [[tunica media]], and a restriction in the size of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], resulting in reduced blood flow which in turn causes [[myocardial infarction]] and can later cause [[sudden cardiac death]].<ref>Virmani R, Forman MB, Rabinowitz M, McAllister HA (1984) "Coronary artery dissections" ''Cardiol Clinics''</ref><ref>Kamineni R, Sadhu A, Alpert JS. (2002) "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: Report of two cases and 50-year review of the literature" ''Cardiol Rev''</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A selective coronary [[angiogram]] is the most common method to diagnose the condition, although it is sometimes not recognised until after death.<ref>C. Basso, G. L. Morgagni, G. Thiene (1996) "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a neglected cause of acute myocardial ischaemia and sudden death" ''BMJ''</ref>  Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is also used as it is able to more easily differentiate the condition from [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic disease]].<ref name="Ultrasound">[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/471327_6 Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging in the Diagnosis and Treatment: The Future: IVUS-Guided DES Implantation?]</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is varied depending upon the nature of the case.  In severe cases, [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] is performed to redirect blood flow around the affected area.<ref>[http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Heart-Disease/Coronary-artery-dissection-treatment/show/866971 MedHelp:Coronary artery dissection treatment]</ref>  [[Drug-eluting stent]]s and [[thrombolytic drug]] therapy are less invasive options for less severe cases.<ref name="Ultrasound"/>

==Epidemiology==
Eighty percent of cases are in women, and a third late in pregnancy or shortly after.{{cite|November}}
