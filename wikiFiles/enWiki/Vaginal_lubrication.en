'''Vaginal lubrication''' is a [[lubrication|lubricating]] fluid that is naturally produced in a [[woman]]'s [[vagina]]. Vaginal lubrication or moistness is always present, but production increases significantly during [[sexual arousal]] in anticipation of [[sexual intercourse]]. '''Vaginal dryness''' is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication sexual intercourse can be painful both to the woman and the man. The vagina has no glands, and therefore must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma seepage from vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the [[Bartholin's gland]]s, located slightly below and to the left and right of the [[introitus]] (opening of the vagina), also secrete [[mucus]] to augment vaginal-wall secretions.

The lubricative fluid contains water, [[pyridine]], [[squalene]], [[urea]], [[acetic acid]], [[lactic acid]], complex [[alcohol]]s and [[glycol]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[aldehyde]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.the-clitoris.com/n_html/female_body_fluids.htm | title = The-Clitoris.com: Female Body Fluids | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> <!-- esp. for pyridine which is mentioned as toxic on its own page --> It can vary in consistency, texture, taste, color, and odor, depending on sexual arousal, the phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], the presence of an infection, certain drugs, genetic factors, and diet.

Vaginal fluid is slightly acidic and can become more acidic with certain [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. The normal [[pH]] of vaginal fluid is between 3.8 and 4.5,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.freshpatents.com/Device-and-method-for-identifying-and-treating-vaginal-affections-dt20070920ptan20070218132.php | title = Device and Method for Identifying and Treating Vaginal Affections | accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref><ref name="Vaginal2000-Moses">{{cite web | author = Moses, Scott, MD | year = 2000 | url = http://www.fpnotebook.com/GYN78.htm | title = Vaginal Fluid pH | work = Family Practice Notebook, LLC | accessdate = 2007-02-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070106010107/http://www.fpnotebook.com/GYN78.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-06}}</ref> whereas male [[semen]] is typically between 7.2 and 8.0 (a neutral substance has a pH of 7.0).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/urology/male_infertility/SEMEN_ANALYSIS.html | title = SEMEN ANALYSIS | accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref>

=== Production ===
The human vagina is innervated by nerves that respond to [[vasoactive intestinal polypeptide]] (VIP). As a consequence, VIP induces an increase in vaginal blood flow accompanied by an increase in vaginal lubrication. The findings suggest that VIP may participate in the control of the local physiological changes observed during sexual arousal: genital vasodilation and increase in vaginal lubrication.<ref>Ottesen B, Pedersen B, Nielsen J, Dalgaard D, Wagner G, Fahrenkrug J. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3432128 Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) provokes vaginal lubrication in normal women] ''[[Peptides (journal)|Peptides]]''. 1987 Sep-Oct;8(5):797-800. PMID: 3432128</ref>

==Vaginal dryness==
Insufficient lubrication or vaginal dryness in women can cause [[dyspareunia]], which is a type of [[sexual pain disorder]]. While vaginal dryness is considered an indicator for [[Female sexual arousal disorder|sexual arousal disorder]], male circumcision exacerbates female vaginal dryness during intercourse.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Gregory Boyle |date=12 September 2003|title=Effects of male circumcision on female arousal and orgasm |journal= Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association |volume=116 |issue=1181 |url=http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/116-1181/595/ |accessdate=2010-01-20 }}</ref> Vaginal dryness may also result from insufficient excitement and stimulation or from hormonal changes caused by [[menopause]] (potentially causing [[atrophic vaginitis]]), [[pregnancy]], or breast-feeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sexual intimacy.

Certain medications, including some over-the-counter [[antihistamine]]s, as well as life events such as pregnancy, [[lactation]], [[menopause]], [[Senescence|aging]] or diseases such as [[diabetes]], will inhibit lubrication.  Medicines with [[anticholinergic]] or [[sympathomimetic]] effects will dry out the mucosal or "wet" tissues of the vagina.  Such medicines include many common drugs for allergic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, and other medical conditions. [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Oral contraceptives]] may also increase or decrease vaginal lubrication.

Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and reduced [[estrogen]] levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness.<ref name="sexualityandu.ca">{{cite web|title=SEXUALITY IN OLDER WOMEN AND THEIR PARTNERS:  AGE-RELATED FACTORS THAT IMPACT SEXUAL FUNCTIONING|url=http://sexualityandu.ca/health-care-professionals/sexuality-in-older-women-and-their-partners/age-related-health-changes|year=2008|publisher=sexualityandu.ca|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>

==Artificial lubricants==
{{Main|Personal lubricant}}
When a woman is experiencing vaginal dryness before sexual activity, during which she produces insufficient vaginal lubrication, sexual intercourse may be uncomfortable or painful for her.  A [[personal lubricant]] can be applied to the vaginal opening, the penis, or both, to augment the naturally produced lubrication and prevent or reduce the discomfort or pain. More rarely, a vaginal [[suppository]] may be inserted prior to intercourse.

[[Personal lubricant#Oil-based|Oil-based lubricant]]s can weaken latex and reduce the effectiveness of [[condom]]s, [[latex glove]]s, or [[dental dam]]s as either forms of [[birth control]] or for protection from sexually transmitted diseases, so [[Personal lubricant#Water-based|water-]] or [[Personal lubricant#Silicone-based|silicone-based]] lubricants are often used instead. The use of an artificial lubricant can make sexual intercourse less painful for a woman, but does not address the underlying cause of the vaginal dryness itself.

==Dry sex==
Some women practice [[dry sex]]. This involves the woman having sexual intercourse after removing vaginal lubrication in some way.<ref name=IFPP>International Family Planning Perspectives, Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998, [http://www.alanguttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2409398.html Vaginal Drying Agents and HIV Transmission] by Karen E. Kun.</ref> The rationale for the practice seems to be for cleansing purposes and to enhance the sexual pleasure of the male.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3775349 Local voices: What some Harare men say about preparation for sex]</ref>  However, besides making sexual intercourse painful for the female and the male,<ref name="cirp.org">[http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/baleta1/ Concern voiced over "dry sex" practices in South Africa<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the practice is believed to increase the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases for both partners.<ref name="cirp.org"/> For instance, the risk of [[HIV]] transmission is increased by lacerations in the vaginal tissue resulting from the lack of lubrication.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/1999/12/10/drysex/ “Dry sex” worsens AIDS numbers in southern Africa - Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
