{{Other uses|Amnios (disambiguation)}} 
The '''amnios''' is a pouch in which an [[embryo]] develops. It is a defining characteristic of [[amniote]]s.<ref name="Laurin00">{{cite journal | last1=Laurin | first1=M. | last2=Girondot | first2=M. | last3=de Ricqlès | first3=A. |title=Early tetrapod evolution | journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages 118-123 | year=2000 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01780-2 | url=

In [[elephant]]s, "The amnios is continued from the base of the umbilical cord upon the [[allantois]], which is of considerable size, and is so interposed between the [[chorion]] and amnios, as to prevent any part of the amnios attaining the inner surface of the [[placenta]]. The amnios consists of two layers:one is the granular layer, continued upon the inner or foetal surface of the allantois, and thence upon the umbilical cord; the other is the smooth outer layer, continued upon the outer or chorional surface of the allantois, and thence upon the inner surface of the chorion."<ref name="Owen57">{{cite journal | last1=Owen | first1=R. | title=Description of the foetal membranes and placenta of the elephant (''Elephas Indicus'', Cuv.), with remarks on the value of placentary characters in the classification of the mammalia | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume=147 | year=1857 | pages=347–353 | jstor=108622}}</ref>{{rp|348}}
