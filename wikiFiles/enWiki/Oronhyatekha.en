'''Oronhyatekha''' (10 August 1841 â€“ 3 March 1907), ('''"Burning Sky"''' or '''"Burning Cloud"''' in the [[Mohawk language]], also carried the baptismal name '''Peter Martin'''), was a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] physician, scholar, and a unique figure in the history of British colonialism.  He was the first known aboriginal Oxford scholar; the second aboriginal medical doctor in [[Canada]];<ref name=dcb>{{cite web | url = http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=6976 | title = Oronhyatekha | work = Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online | author = Gayle M.

While all this would be remarkable in any age, that he achieved it during the [[Victorian era]] when racism and assimilation were official state policies, has made him a figure approaching legend in some aboriginal circles.

==Biography==
Born 10 August 1841 on the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]] near [[Brantford, Ontario]], he attended the Wesleyan Academy in [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts]]. After graduating, he taught for a year among the Indians and then entered [[Kenyon College]].<ref name=dcb/><ref name=acab>{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Oronhyatekha|year=1900}}</ref>

Oronhyatekha was selected at the age of twenty by the Six Nations [[Iroquois]] Confederacy (consisting of the Mohawk, [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] Nations) to give the welcoming address to the [[Prince of Wales]] during his visit to New World. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward]] was sufficiently impressed that he urged the young Oronhyatekha to attend the [[University of Oxford]].  Oronhyatekha matriculated at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] in 1862.

In 1863, Oronhyatekha returned to Canada to marry Ellen Hill, and took a medical degree at the [[University of Toronto]]. As his medical practice grew, he also became a figure of increasing importance in Victorian Canada.  In 1871, be became a member of Canada's [[National Rifle Team]], and in 1874, was elected the President of the [[Assembly of First Nations|Grand Council of Canadian Chiefs]], the highest ranking native statesman in North America.

In 1878, he applied to become a member of the [[Fraternal Forestry|Independent Order of Foresters]], a [[Friendly society|fraternal and financial institution]] associated with the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]].  Although the Foresters' statutes explicitly limited its membership to white men and [[Orange Order|Orangemen]], Oronhyatekha was not only inducted as a member, but rose to become Supreme Chief Ranger of Foresters, the organisation's international CEO, in 1881, a position that he held for a record 26 years.  During his tenure, he transformed the order into one of the wealthiest fraternal financial institutions in the Victorian world; today, it counts more than one-million members in North America and the European Union.

While heading the Foresters, he built one of the first North American museums created by a Native individual.<ref>Michelle A Hamilton, ''Collections and Objections:  Aboriginal Material Culture in Southern Ontario.''

The artifacts were transferred to the Royal Ontario Museum in 1911. 

He was the Worshipful Master of Richardson Masonic Lodge in Stouffville, Ontario in 1894.

Ironically, the one achievement of which Oronhyatekha was most proud was the enterprise his contemporaries regarded as his only significant failure.  In 1904, he created an orphanage on the [[Bay of Quinte]], Ontario, which was universally seen as extravagant and excessive by Victorian standards.  It opened for operations in 1906, and Oronhyatekha described it as his life's crowning achievement.  He did not live to see it burn down the following year, as he died in 1907.

Oronhyatekha has commemorated with several designations, including a plaque erected by the [http://www.heritagetoronto.org/discover-toronto/map/plaque/oronhyatekha-burning-cloud Toronto Historical Board] in Cabbagetown where he lived in Toronto. His house at 211 Carlton is listed in the [http://www.cabbagetownhcd.ca/northwest.html Cabbagetown heritage inventory] but not yet designated under the Ontario Heritage Act. His former home in London, Ontario, at 72 Central Avenue, is currently under consideration for local designation. Parks Canada designated him as a national historic person in 2001, erecting a plaque at Tyendinaga. In 2002, the Royal Ontario Museum and the Woodland Cultural Centre curated an exhibit called [http://woodland-centre.library.cornell.edu/ Mohawk Ideals, Victorian Values] which featured his museum collection, once displayed at the IOF Temple building. His biography is currently being co-authored by Keith Jamieson and [http://www.history.uwo.ca/faculty/hamilton/ Michelle Hamilton] for Dundurn Press.
