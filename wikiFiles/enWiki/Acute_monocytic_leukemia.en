'''Acute monocytic leukemia''' ('''AMoL''', or '''AML-M5''')<ref name="urlAcute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/cancer/leukemia/conditions/aml/signs.html |title=Acute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms |format= |work=}}</ref> is considered a type of [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. 

==Diagnosis==
In order to fulfill [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) criteria for AML-5, a patient must have greater than 20% blasts in the [[bone marrow]], and of these, greater than 80% must be of the [[Monocyte|monocytic]] lineage. A further subclassification (M5a versus M5b) is made depending on whether the monocytic cells are predominantly [[monoblast]]s (>80%) ('''acute monoblastic leukemia''') or a mixture of monoblasts and [[promonocyte]]s (<80% blasts). Monoblasts can be distinguished by having a roughly circular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], delicate lacy [[chromatin]], and abundant, often basophilic [[cytoplasm]]. These cells may also have [[pseudopod]]s. By contrast, promonocytes have a more convoluted nucleus, and their cytoplasm may contain metachromatic granules. Monoblasts are typically [[Myeloperoxidase|MPO]]-negative and promonocytes are MPO variable. Both monoblasts and promonocytes stain positive for [[non-specific esterase]] (NSE), however NSE may often be negative.

Immunophenotypically, M5-AML variably express myeloid ([[CD13]], [[CD33]]) and monocytic ([[CD11b]], [[CD11c]]) markers. Cells may aberrantly express B-cell marker [[CD20]] and the NK marker [[CD56]]. Monoblasts may be positive for [[CD34]].

==Causes==
M5 is associated with characteristic [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]], often involving [[Chromosome 11 (human)|Chromosome 11]] at 11q23 or t(9;11) affecting the [[MLL (gene)|MLL]] locus, however the MLL translocation is also found in other AML subtypes. MLL is believed to be prognostically unfavorable in AML-M5 compared to other genetic alterations involving MLL such as t(9;11). The t(8;16) translocation in MLL is associated with [[hemophagocytosis]].

AML-M5 is thought{{By whom|date=March 2009}} to be associated with exposure to [[Epipodophyllotoxin]].

==Treatment==
AML-M5 is treated with intensive [[chemotherapy]] (such as [[anthracyclines]]) or with [[bone marrow transplantation]].
