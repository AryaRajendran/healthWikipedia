'''Nephrotoxicity''' (from Greek: nephros, "kidney") is a [[poison]]ous effect of some substances, both [[toxic]] chemicals and [[medication]], on the [[kidney]]s. There are various forms of toxicity.<ref name="pmid10815380 ">{{cite journal |author= Galley HF |title=''Can acute renal failure be prevented |journal= J R Coll Surg Edinb |volume=45 |issue= 1 |pages=44–50 |year=2000 |pmid=10815380 |url=http://www.rcsed.ac.uk/journal/vol45_1/4510008.htm }}</ref> Nephrotoxicity should not be confused with the fact that some medications have a predominantly renal excretion and need their dose adjusted for the decreased [[renal function]] (e.g. [[heparin]]).

'''Nephrotoxins''' are chemicals displaying nephrotoxicity.

The nephrotoxic effect of most drugs is more profound in patients who already suffer from renal impairment. Some drugs may affect renal function in more than one way.

==Types of toxicity==
===Cardiovascular===
* General: [[diuretics]], [[Beta blocker|&beta;-blockers]], [[vasodilator]] agents
* Local: [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[cyclosporine]],<ref name="pmid19218475 ">{{cite journal |author=Naesens M, Kuypers DR, Sarwal M |title=Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity |journal=Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=4 |issue= 2 |pages=481–509 |year=2009 |pmid=19218475  |doi=10.2215/CJN.04800908}}</ref> [[tacrolimus]].<ref name="pmid19218475 "/>

===Direct tubular effect===
* [[Proximal convoluted tubule]]: [[Aminoglycoside]] antibiotics (e.g. [[gentamicin]]), [[amphotericin B]], [[cisplatin]], [[radiocontrast]] media, [[immunoglobulin]]s, [[mannitol]]
* [[Distal tubule]]: [[NSAIDs]] (e.g. [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], [[diclofenac]]), [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[cyclosporin]], [[lithium salt]]s, [[cyclophosphamide]], [[amphotericin B]]
* Tubular obstruction: [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], [[methotrexate]], [[aciclovir]], [[polyethylene glycol]], [[triamterene]].

===Acute interstitial nephritis===
* [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|&beta;-lactam antibiotics]], [[vancomycin]], [[rifampicin]], [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[NSAID]]s,  [[ranitidine]], [[cimetidine]], [[furosemide]], [[thiazide]]s, [[phenytoin]].

==Chronic interstitial nephritis==
* Lithium
* cyclosporine <ref>USMLE WORLD QBanks 2009, Step1, Pharmacology, Q74</ref>

===Acute glomerulonephritis===
Drug-induced glomerular disease is not common but there are a few drugs that have been implicated. Glomerular lesions primarily occur through immune mediated pathways rather than through direct drug toxicity.
* [[Heroin]] and [[Pamidronate]] are known to cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
* [[Gold salts]] therapy can cause membranous nephropathy<ref>USMLE WORLD QBanks 2009, Step1, Pharmacology, Q74</ref>
* [[Penicillamine]]

===Causes of diabetes insipidus===
* [[Lithium salt]]s
* [[Amphotericin B]] -- reversible at low doses, irreversible at high doses
* [[Fluoride]]
* [[Demeclocycline]]
* [[Foscarnet]].

===Other nephrotoxins===
* [[Heavy metals]] interfere with enzymes of energy metabolism.
* [[Aristolochic acid]], found in some plants and, more dangerously, in some herbal supplements derived from those plants, has been shown to have nephrotoxic effects on humans.

==Surveillance==
Nephrotoxicity is usually monitored through a simple blood test. A decreased [[creatinine clearance]] indicates poor renal function. Normal [[creatinine clearance]] levels are between 80 - 120 μmol/L. In interventional radiology, a patients' [[creatinine clearance]] levels are all checked prior to a procedure.  Should an elevated creatinine clearance level be found, a special [[contrast medium]] or [[radiocontrast]] is used which is less harmful for the patient.<!-- Will reference ASAP -->

[[Serum creatinine]] is another measure of [[renal function]], which may be more useful clinically when dealing with patients with early kidney disease.
