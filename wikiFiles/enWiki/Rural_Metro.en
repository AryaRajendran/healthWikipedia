==History==
Founder Lou Witzeman, a newspaper reporter, witnessed a house fire near his home just outside the city limits of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1948. There was no fire department established for the area. Witzeman felt something had to be done, went and purchased a [[fire engine]] and proceeded to go door to door asking residents to subscribe to the new fire service by paying an annual membership fee (in lieu of taxes).<ref name=rm-hist /> This was the origin of the Rural Fire Department, later renamed Rural/Metro Fire Department.

==Emergency Medical Services==
In 1969, Rural/Metro began offering ambulance service to customers by placing an ambulance at its fire station in the unincorporated Cave Creek, Arizona.  Rural/Metro continues to operate fire based and EMS based ambulance services.  

Many communities are covered under a master contract in which Rural/Metro is selected as the sole provider for fire services, or 911 ambulance services for a jurisdiction. Additionally, Rural/Metro offers other transport services in areas in which they are not the primary EMS provider. Rural/Metro currently offers ambulance services in 450 communities across 20 states.<ref name=rm-amb>http://www.ruralmetro.com/our-services/emergency-ambulance.html Rural/Metro Ambulance Services</ref>

==Fire Protection Services==
Today, Rural/Metro continues to offer private fire protection services to communities across the Unites States. The company has traditionally offered services in locations in which there are no other fire departments operating. Many of these locations contract directly with subscribers to collect fees. Rural/Metro Fire Department serves under a master contract in a handful of communities and receives operating funds directly from the community (tax based, yet privately provided).<ref name=rm-fire>http://www.ruralmetro.com/our-services/community-fire-protection.html Rural/Metro Community Fire Protection</ref> Rural/Metro Fire Department provides services to nonsubscribers in these communities, billing the property owner after the incident to recoup costs associated with the mitigation of the emergency.<ref name=rm-fire-2>https://www.ruralmetrofire.com/subscriptions/renew-fire-subscription.html Rural/Metro Fire Department Subscription Information</ref>
