'''Reed’s syndrome''' (or '''familial leiomyomatosis cutis et uteri''') is a rare inherited condition characterised by [[multiple cutaneous leiomyoma]]s and, in women, [[Uterine fibroid|uterine leiomyoma]]s. It predisposes for [[renal cell cancer]], an association denominated '''hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer''',<ref name=Tolvanen2012>{{cite pmid|22473397}}</ref><ref name=Toro2003>{{cite pmid|12772087}}</ref> and it is also associated with increased risk of uterine [[leiomyosarcoma]].<ref name=Pithukpakorn2006/> The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the [[fumarate hydratase]] gene, which leads to an accumulation of [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]]. The inheritance pattern is [[Genetic_disorder#Autosomal_dominant|autosomal dominant]].
==History==

The syndrome was first described by Reed ''et al'' in 1973.<ref name=Reed1973>{{cite pmid|4127477}}</ref> The link with the fumerate hydratase gene was uncovered in 2002.<ref name=Tomlinson2002>{{cite pmid|11865300}}</ref>

==Genomics==

The fumarate hydratase gene, located on the long arm of [[chromosome 1]] (1q42.3-43), spans 22 kilobases and has 10 [[exon]]s. The first exon codes for a [[signal peptide]].

==Pathogensis==

While the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the lesions remain unclear, it has been suggested that the accumulation of fumarate may lead to overexpression of the [[aldo-keto reductase]] enzyme, [[AKR1B10]].<ref name=Ooi2011>{{cite pmid|22014576}}</ref> It has also been found that fumerate is present in the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and in the [[cytoplasm]]. The cytoplasmic form appears to have a role in the protection of DNA from molecular injury.<ref name=Yogev2010>{{cite pmid|20231875}}</ref>
Fumarate has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of [[prolyl hydroxylase]]. This inhibition leads to the stabilisation of a number of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] which are thought to predispose to tumorigensis.  
An alternative pathway for the metabolism of fumarate in the presence of these mutations has been described.<ref name=Frezza2011>{{cite pmid|21849978}}</ref> Other genes involved affected by this mutation are [[Keap1]], [[Nrf2]] and [[HMOX1]].<ref name=Kinch2011>{{cite pmid|22014567}}</ref>

==Clinical presentation, symptoms==

Almost all women present with uterine fibroids, approximately 76% with dermal manifestations and 10-16% with renal tumors.<ref name=Pithukpakorn2006/>

The uterine fibroids tend to occur at younger age and larger and more numerous than in general population. They may be distinguishable from sporadic fibroids by special histological features such as prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halos.<ref name=Garg_2011/>

The skin presentation is of asymmetrical, reddish-brown nodules or papules with a firm consistency, predominantly located on the limbs ([[multiple cutaneous leiomyoma]]), although they may occur anywhere, including the face. The lesions, which are typically painful and most often present during the third decade of life, are [[piloleiomyomata]]—a benign [[smooth muscle]] tumour arising from the [[arrectores pilorum]] muscles of the skin. These tumours may also arise in the [[Dartos|tunica dartos]] of the [[scrotum]] and the mammillary muscle of the nipple ([[genital leiomyoma]]), the smooth muscle of blood vessels ([[angioleiomyoma]]) and the lung ([[pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis]]).<ref name=Kogan2001>{{cite pmid|11810925}}</ref> A pseudo-[[Darier sign]] may be present.  

The renal cell carcinoma tends to be of the papillary (type 2) form and tends to occur more commonly in women than men with this syndrome. These cancers present earlier than is usual for renal cell carcinomas (typically in the twenties and thirties) and to be at relatively advanced stages at presentation. Tumours have rarely been reported in children. These tumours occur in ~20% of those with this mutation suggesting that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis. 

===Histology===

The skin lesions may be difficult to diagnose clinically but a [[punch biopsy]] will usually reveal a [[Grenz zone]] [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Grenz+Zone] separating the tumour from the overlying skin. Histological examination shows dense dermal nodules composed of elongated cells with abundant eosinophilic [[cytoplasm]] arranged in [[fascicle]]s ([[spindle cell]]s). The [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] are uniform, blunt-ended and cigar-shaped with only occasional [[mitosis|mitoses]]. Special stains that may be of use in the diagnosis include [[Masson's trichrome]], [[Van Gieson's stain]] and [[phosphotungstic acid]]–[[haematoxylin]].

The renal cell carcinomas have prominent eosinophilic [[nucleolus|nucleoli]] surrounded by a clear halo.

===Associated conditions===

Other relatively rare conditions have been reported in association with this disease. It is not yet known if these associations are fortuitous or manifestations of the condition itself. 

Cerebral [[cavernoma]]s and massive, macronodular adrenocortical disease have also been reported in association with this syndrome.<ref name=Campione2007>{{cite pmid|17476294}}</ref><ref name=Matyakhina2005>{{cite pmid|15741255}}</ref> A case of [[cutis verticis gyrata]], disseminated [[collagenoma]] and [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] in association with a mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene has also been reported.<ref name=Marque2010>{{cite pmid|20560959}}</ref> Two cases of ovarian mucinous cystadenoma have also been reported with this mutation.<ref name=Ylisaukko-oja2006>{{cite pmid|16639410}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis is made either by testing of the fumarate hydratase activity in cultured skin [[fibroblast]]s or lymphoblastoid cells and demonstrating reduced activity (≤60%) or by molecular genetic testing.<ref name=Pithukpakorn2006>{{cite pmid|20301430}}</ref> Special histologic features of fibroids may allow an early diagnosis in absence of other symptoms.<ref name=Garg_2011>{{cite pmid|21753700}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis== 

Differential diagnosis of this condition includes the [[Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome]] and [[tuberous sclerosis]]. As the skin lesions are typically painful, it is also often necessary to exclude other painful tumors of the skin (including [[blue rubber bleb nevus]], [[leiomyoma]], [[eccrine spiradenoma]], [[neuroma]], [[dermatofibroma]], [[angiolipoma]], [[neurilemmoma]], [[endometrioma]], [[glomus tumor]] and [[granular cell tumor]]; the mnemonic "BLEND-AN-EGG" may be helpful). Other skin lesions that may need to be considered include [[dermal cylindroma|cylindroma]], [[lipoma]], [[poroma]] and [[trichoepithelioma]]; these tend to be painless and have other useful distinguishing features.

==Treatment==

[[Uterine fibroid]]s can be treated with the same methods like sporadic uterine fibroids including antihormonal treatment, surgery or [[embolisation]]. Substantially elevated risk of progression to or independent development of uterine leiomyosarcoma has been reported which may influence treatment methods.<ref name=Pithukpakorn2006/>

The predisposition to renal cell cancer calls for screening and, if necessary, [[urologist|urological]] management. 

The skin lesions may be difficult to treat as they tend to recur after excision or destructive treatment.  Drugs which affect smooth muscle contraction, such as [[doxazosin]], [[nitroglycerine]], [[nifedipine]] and [[phenoxybenzamine]], may provide pain relief.

==Notes==
 
A database of the mutations of the fumarate hydratase gene is available.<ref name=Bayley2008>{{cite pmid|18366737}}</ref> Autosomal recessive mutations cause a serious neurological disease known as [[fumarase deficiency]], which is associated with a variety of congenital lesions in the brain.
