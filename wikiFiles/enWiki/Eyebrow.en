The '''eyebrow''' is an area of thick, delicate hairs above the [[Human eye|eye]] that follows the shape of the lower margin of the [[Supraorbital ridge|brow ridges]] of some [[mammal]]s. Their main function is to prevent sweat, water, and other debris from falling down into the eye socket, but they are also important to [[human communication]] and [[facial expression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arielspeaks.com/Psychology/Reading_Body_Language-Building_Rapport.html |title=Body Language, Building Instant Rapport, Reading and Interpreting Body Language |publisher=Arielspeaks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> It is not uncommon for people &ndash; women in particular &ndash; to modify their eyebrows by means of hair addition, removal, makeup, tattoo, or piercings. 

==Functions==
===Physical===
It is popularly believed that the main function of the eyebrow is to prevent moisture, mostly salty [[sweat]] and [[rain]], from flowing into the eye (although this suggestion has never been put in a form of scholarly hypothesis). The typical curved shape of the eyebrow (with a slant on the side) and the direction in which eyebrow hairs are pointed, make sure that moisture has a tendency to flow sideways around the eyes, along the side of the head and along the nose.{{fact|date=August 2011}} The slightly protruding [[brow ridge]]s of modern humans could also be used as a defense structure against the floods of moisture.  Desmond Morris, discussing the possible function of the eyebrow in [[human evolution]], criticized this suggestion as non-effective <ref>[[Desmond Morris]], The Naked Man: A Study of  the Male Body. London: Jonathan Cape, 2008</ref> and suggested that the primary function of the eyebrows is to signal the changing moods of their owners. Together with the brow ridges, the eyebrows also shade the eyes from sunlight.{{fact|date=August 2011}} Eyebrows also prevent debris such as [[dandruff]] and other small objects from falling into the eyes, as well as providing a more sensitive sense for detecting objects being near the eye, like small [[insects]].

===Psychological===
Eyebrows also have an important facilitative function in communication, strengthening expressions, such as [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] or [[anger]]. Many makeup artists view eyebrows as a major feature in defining the face.  The eyebrows shape the human face and give definition to one's eyes and forehead. Depending on the shape of the eyebrows, it sometimes can cause what is known as a false facial expression (such as a person's eyebrows shaped to seem as if the person was angry, but really isn't). Some people can also move their eyebrows up and down alternately.

===Eyebrows as eyespots===
[[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that the primary evolutionary function of clearly visible eyebrows was safety from predators during the vulnerable nighttime sleep, when early hominid groups started sleeping on the ground, away from the trees. Stealth predators (like big cats) as a rule stop hunting if they notice that prey animals are watching them. Cheap plastic masks, placed on the back of the head, saved many human lives in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], where [[Man-eater|man eating tigers]] claimed many victims in [[Sundarbans]] national park. Many predators (particularly [[big cats]]) are very sensitive to eyespots, and all the big cats have eyespots on the back of their own ears. According to Jordania, at night, when hominid eyes were closed, the eyebrows, arched upwards, and [[eyelashes]], arched downwards, formed clearly definable oval [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s on a ‘sleeping’ human face, creating an illusion that the eyes were still open and watching (and therefore could deter predators from attacking sleeping hominids).<ref>[[Joseph Jordania]], [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]], chapter "I Can See you! Eyespots in Humans." Logos, 2011, pg. 96  </ref>

=== Identification ===

In a study published by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where subjects were asked to identify celebrities with either their eyes or their eyebrows digitally edited out, the subjects were able to recognize the celebrity 46% of the time with their eyebrows edited out, compared to 60% of the time with their eyes edited out. The findings indicate the importance of eyebrows in providing clues to an individual's identity.<ref name=MIT>Javid Sadrô, Izzat Jarudi, Pawan Sinha.

==Eyebrow modification==
[[File:Eyebrow5.PNG|thumb|right|A woman's eyebrow that has been modified via waxing]]

Eyebrows are a major facial feature. Cosmetic methods have been developed to alter the look of one's eyebrows, whether the goal is to add or remove hair, change the color, or change the position of the eyebrow.

Several options for removing hair to achieve a thinner or smaller eyebrow, or to "correct" a [[unibrow]], including tweezing, waxing, threading and electronic tweezing. The most common method is to use [[tweezers]] to thin out and shape the eyebrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makeup-product.com/pluck-eyebrow.htm |title=Advanced Tips for Eyebrow Plucking |publisher=Makeup-product.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> [[Waxing]] is becoming more popular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-n-skin-care.com/articles/214/make-up/eyebrow-waxing.html |title=Eyebrow Waxing 101 - Makeup - Skin & Beauty - Daily Glow |publisher=Hair-n-skin-care.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> Lastly, there is [[threading (epilation)|threading]] eyebrows, where a cotton thread is rolled over hair to pull it out. Small scissors are sometimes used to trim the eyebrows, either with another method of [[hair removal]] or alone. All of these methods can be painful for some seconds or minutes due to the sensitivity of the area around the eye but, often, this pain decreases over time as the individual becomes used to it. In time, hair that has been plucked will stop growing back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheilasfashionsense.com/eyebrows.htm |title=What You Should Know About Eyebrows - http |publisher=//www.sheilasfashionsense.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> Some people wax or shave off their eyebrows and leave them bare, stencil or draw them in with [[eye liner]], or [[tattoo]] them on. In Western societies, it has become more common for men to pluck part of their eyebrows.

To create a fuller look, eyebrows can be cloned in an [[eyebrow transplant]]: Individual strands of the eyebrow are mimicked to create a natural-looking eyebrow of the desired shape. Eyebrow brushes and shaders are used to further define the eyebrow. A fairly recent trend in eyebrow modification is in eyebrow tinting: Permanent dye, similar to hair color, is used on the eyebrow, often to darken them. 

An eyebrow lift, a [[cosmetic surgery]] to raise the eyebrow, usually to create a more feminine or youthful appearance, is a new phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/brow_lift_cosmetic_surgery/article.htm |title=Brow Lift Procedure Recovery, Before and After on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> They can be affected during a [[face lift]] or an eye lift. More recently, doctors inject patients' eyebrows with [[botox]] or similar toxins to temporarily raise the eyebrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/573716 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>

From the 8th century, many Japanese noblewomen practiced ''[[hikimayu]]'', shaving or plucking the eyebrow hair and painting smudge-like ones higher on the forehead.  Shaving lines in eyebrows is another cosmetic alteration, more common among younger people in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bruce Ely, The Oregonian |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1209345907235720.xml&coll=7 |title=Teens shaving lines in eyebrows raise gang concerns in schools |publisher=OregonLive.com |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>
