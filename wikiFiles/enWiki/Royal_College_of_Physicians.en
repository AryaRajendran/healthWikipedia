The '''Royal College of Physicians of London''' is a British professional body of doctors of [[internal medicine|general medicine]] and its subspecialties. <br />
It was originally founded as the '''College of Physicians'''. It received a [[royal charter]] in 1518 from [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], affirmed by [[Act of Parliament]] in 1523. <br />
It is a member of the UK [[Academy of Medical Royal Colleges]].

It was the first medical institution in England to become a [[Royal College]], and the first Royal College in the UK and Ireland for [[physicians]]; its charter followed that of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] which received its royal charter in 1506. <br />
The college has been continuously active in improving practice medicine since then, primarily though training and qualifying new physicians. <br />
The {{As of|2012|alt=current}} President of the college is Sir [[Richard Thompson (physician)|Richard Thompson]].

==History==
A small group of distinguished physicians, led by the scholar and humanist [[Thomas Linacre]], petitioned the King to be incorporated into a College similar to those found in a number of other European countries. The main functions of the College, as set down in the founding Charter, were to grant licenses to those qualified to practice and to punish unqualified practitioners and those engaging in malpractice. This included [[pharmacy|apothecaries]] as well as physicians.

The College was based at three sites in the City of London near [[St Paul's Cathedral]], before moving to Pall Mall East (overlooking [[Trafalgar Square]]), and finally on to its current location in [[Regent's Park]].
<br />The first Harveian Librarian was [[Christopher Merret]].<!-- The book in the Further Reading section has lots of details of the RCP around this time, a great source-->

Throughout its history the College has issued advice across the whole range of medical and health matters. College publications include the first ten editions of the London Pharmacopoeia (written in [[Latin]], and used for regulating the composition of medicines from 1618 and, through the College's police the Censors, for enforcing the College's monopoly on medical science, then being challenged by the [[Society of Apothecaries]]), and the `Nomenclature of Diseases' in 1869. The latter created the international standard for the classification of diseases which was to last until the [[World Health Organisation]]'s
[[ICD|Manual of the international classification of diseases]] superseded it in the twentieth century.

The College became the licensing body for medical books in the late seventeenth century, and sought to set new standards in learning through its own system of examinations. The College's great tradition of examining continues to this day and it is still perhaps how the College is best known to the general public.

==Membership and Fellowship==
The MRCP(UK)(www.mrcpexam.com) postnominal is used by doctors who have passed the examinations for the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|Diploma of Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom]], which are held jointly by all of the UK Royal Colleges of Physicians. 
<br/>Holders of the MRCP(UK) may also become "Collegiate Members" of the London College (using the additional post-nominal MRCP(Lond)) and/or of the other two UK colleges. 
<br/>
Affiliate Membership of the Royal College of Physicians is a similar level of membership as Collegiate membership, but is awarded to senior doctors without MRCP(UK). <br/>
Both Collegiate Members and Affiliate Members may be considered for advancement to Fellowship of the College.
<br/>
The College also has Associate, Medical Student and Foundation Doctor levels of membership.

Fellows (who use the postnominal FRCP) are elected mostly from the general Membership (Collegiate or Affiliate), but also occasionally from among the members of the more specialised faculties within the Royal Colleges of Physicians, e.g. Occupational Medicine (MFOM), Pharmaceutical Medicine (MFPM), and Forensic and Legal Medicine (MFLM), etc. 
There are also Fellows who are elected ''de jure'' (usually medical experts from other countries), and ''honoris causa'' (dignitaries, members of the Royal Family, etc.).

The diploma of Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP) is no longer awarded. The LRCP qualification used to be reserved for medical graduates, in practice mainly Bachelors of Medicine from Oxford and Cambridge, but in the mid-nineteenth century became part of a very popular initial qualification in medicine awarded together with the MRCS (Eng) by the [[Conjoint|Conjoint Board]], which, by the end of the twentieth century came to be largely taken by overseas graduates. From 1993 the LRCP was awarded together with the LRCS and LMSSA through the [[United Examining Board]] until this pathway to medical registration was abolished in 1999.

==Library==
The library aims to support the learning and information needs of the RCP's members, students and staff. The unique collections are also used by members of the public interested in researching:
* history of medicine
* genealogy
* health and social policy
* medical education

The enquiry service provides information on the current role and functions of the RCP as well as its history.
Reference access to the library collections is available to all. The reading room is open Monday - Friday, 9 - 5, apart from bank holidays.

===Rare book collections===
The Royal College of Physicians has had a library since its foundation in 1518, although most of the original books were destroyed during the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. The rare books and special collections are diverse in coverage, reflecting the collecting habits of earlier fellows and the need to provide the broad educational base considered suitable for physicians.

Books and journals – new and old – display a continuum of change and development in the RCP's specialties, as well as in the medical profession.
Highlights include:
* approximately 130 books printed before 1502, including some of the earliest printings of the classical medical texts by Greek, Roman and Arabic doctors
* books belonging to and annotated by the [[Elizabethan]] astrologer and occultist [[John Dee]]
* approximately 3,000 books, dated up to 1688, in the [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester|Dorchester]] collection, on a variety of subjects including architecture, science and travel
* over 4,500 tracts from the 17th to the 19th century covering a wide range of subjects, both medical and scientific
* the Evan Bedford collection, which includes almost every significant text in the history of cardiology up to 1970

Highlights of the 20th century collection include:
* books relating to the history of the RCP's specialties
* biographies of fellows and prominent figures in medicine
* books relating to the formation of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) and its continuing history
* books relating to the history of hospitals in the UK
* books relating to medical ethics and the status and role of the physician
* every item published by the RCP, including reports and pamphlets.

The book collections are displayed in regularly changing exhibitions.

==Museum collections==
The collections at the Royal College of Physicians relate to the history of the College, and the history of the Physician’s profession. They help to place the history and development of medicine and health care in its widest context. The collections include: portraits, silver, medical instruments, the Symons Collection, commemorative medals and anatomical tables. Each individual item has a story to tell and can provide insights into a continual movement for the advancement of healthcare.

The collection of c. 250 portraits provides a pictorial and sculptural record of Presidents, Fellows and other physicians associated with it from its foundation in 1518 to the present day. It includes some outstanding pieces by well-known artists, such as a bust of [[Baldwin Hamey Junior]] (1600–1676) by Edward Pierce and one of [[Richard Mead]] (1673–1754) by Louis François Roubiliac. But perhaps of more interest are the portraits by lesser-known artists, revealing their best talents, such as [[Richard Hale]] (1670–1728) by Jonathan Richardson. 

In 1964 a volume about the ''Portraits'' of the College was published by [[Gordon Wolstenholme]] in which the portraits were described by Sir [[David Piper]].

The silver collection reflects events in the College’s history as well as the lives and generosity of its Fellows and Members. Few pieces pre-date the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666) because of a robbery during the previous year. Baldwin Hamey’s inkstand bell and [[William Harvey]]'s demonstration rod are two of the pieces that survive. Many pieces of silver are ‘working’ objects and are used to this day for formal occasions in the College. Special objects include the President’s staff of office, the caduceus and the [[silver-gilt]] College mace.

The College also owns six 17th century anatomical tables, probably made by drying and mounting the actual blood vessels and nerves of the human body onto blocks of wood and then varnishing them. They would have been used as a teaching aid for teaching anatomy, because it was difficult to obtain cadavers for dissection.

The Symons Collection of medical instruments is well displayed within the College building. The collection began as a collection of objects relating to self-care in Georgian times and expanded to include items that would have been used by physicians when treating patients, mostly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The collections are open to the general public Monday to Friday 9&nbsp;am - 5pm. The Royal College of Physicians is a member of [[the London Museums of Health & Medicine]].

==Facility==
The College is now located in St. Andrews Place, which is at the north end of the road running up the east side of [[Regent's Park]], Park Square East. The College building itself is notable. It was designed by architect Sir [[Denys Lasdun]] in 1964 and has since been recognised as a building of national importance: it is a Grade I [[listed building]], one of a very select band of post-war buildings sharing this distinction. Lasdun's use of mosaic clad concrete was extremely influential on many later public buildings. An interesting feature of the building was a 'Moving Wall', weighing five tons (5080&nbsp;kg) and capable of being hydraulically lifted ten feet (3050&nbsp;mm) to unite or sub-divide a hall of sixty-two feet (18.9 m) width, which was the interior width of the building. The hydraulic equipment and the steel framework for the Moving Wall were produced by [[Merryweather & Sons]] Ltd of [[Greenwich]], hydraulic engineers. Although better known for fire fighting equipment it was not the company's first installation of this kind. Technical details of the Moving Wall can be found in Engineering journal, 1 Jan 1965.

The College's previous headquarters, on Pall Mall East/Trafalgar Square, is now [[Canada House]], part of the [[Canadian high commission in London]]. The College had a number of other locations prior to Pall Mall East, in the [[City of London]].

==Publications==
''[[Clinical Medicine]]'' is the College's own [[medical journal]]. It appears once every two months. In addition, the college publishes regular reports, clinical guidelines, and the annual series 'Horizons in Medicine'. The Faculty of Occupational Medicine publishes ''Occupational and Environmental Medicine'', a monthly-published journal that contains studies and articles concerting topics related to human health and environmental topics.

==Training faculties==
The Royal College of Physicians hosts three training faculties: the Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine, the Faculty for Pharmaceutical Medicine and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine.

===Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine===
The [[Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine]] (FPM) of the Royal Colleges of Physicians aims to maintain the highest professional standards in the specialty through activities such as the setting of the Diploma in Pharmaceutical Medicine and other examinations and supervising specialty training in pharmaceutical medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalcareers.nhs.uk/tools_and_resources/spotlight_on_royal_colleges/faculty_of_pharmaceutical_medi.aspx|title= Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine|publisher= NHS|accessdate =20 August 2010}}</ref>

===Faculty of Occupational Medicine===
The [[Faculty of Occupational Medicine]] (FOM) was established to develop and maintain high standards of training and professional integrity in the specialty of occupational medicine. It sets exams, supervises training and supports physicians in their continued professional development. The Faculty also acts as an authoritative body for consultation in matters of education and public interest concerning [[occupational medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalcareers.nhs.uk/tools_and_resources/spotlight_on_royal_colleges/faculty_of_occupational_med.aspx|title = Faculty of Occupational Medicine|publisher = NHS|accessdate =20 August 2010}}</ref>

==College lectures==
The College holds an annual lecture, commonly referred to as the ''[[Lumleian Lectures]]'', which were named in honour of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|Lord Lumley]] and established as part of the Lumleian Trust. The trust and lectures were established in 1582 by Dr. [[Richard Caldwell]], a former president of the college. The subject matter of the lectures was initially in surgery, which was later changed to in medicine.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/heritage/CollegeLectures/Lumleian.htm |title= Heritage Centre : College Lectures |accessdate=3 August 2008 |publisher= Royal College of Physicians }}</ref> The first lecture was given by [[Richard Forster]], and the lectures continue to today.

Other annual lectures are the [[Croonian Lecture]], the [[Goulstonian Lecture]] and the [[Bradshaw Lecture]].

Once a year, traditionally on St Lukes Day, a Fellow is appointed to deliver the [[Harveian Oration]] to the assembled college in memory of [[William Harvey]]. The oration seeks to honour the founders and benefactors of the college and encourage a spirit of experimentation amongst the members.
