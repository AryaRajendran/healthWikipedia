'''Occupational therapy''' (also abbreviated as OT) is the use of treatments to develop, recover, or maintain the daily living and work skills of patients with a physical, mental or developmental condition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics|url=http://www.bls.gov}}</ref>  Occupational therapy is a client-centered practice that places a premium on the progress towards the client’s goals.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Occupational Therapy Association|url=http://www.aota.org}}</ref> Occupational therapy interventions focus on adapting the environment, modifying the task, teaching the skill, and educating the client/family in order to increase participation in and performance of daily activities.

==History of occupational therapy==
{{Hatnote|''See also:'' [[History of occupational therapy in America|History of OT in America]], [[History of occupational therapy in New Zealand|History of OT in New Zealand]], [[Occupational Therapy in the Seychelles]]}}

===Early therapy===
The earliest evidence of using occupations as a method of therapy can be found in ancient times. In c. 100 BCE, Greek physician [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]] initiated humane treatment of patients with mental illness using therapeutic baths, massage, exercise, and music. Later, the Roman [[Celsus]] prescribed music, travel, conversation and exercise to his patients. However by medieval times the concept of humane treatment of people considered to be insane was rare, if not nonexistent.<ref name="quiroga">Quiroga, Virginia A. M., PhD (1995), [http://www1.aota.org/shop_aota/prodview.aspx?TYPE=D&SKU=1132 Occupational Therapy: The First 30 Years, 1900-1930.] Bethesda, Maryland: American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. ISBN 978-1-56900-025-0</ref>

In 18th-century Europe, revolutionaries such as [[Philippe Pinel]] and [[Johann Christian Reil]] reformed the hospital system. Instead of the use of metal chains and restraints, their institutions utilized rigorous work and leisure activities in the late 18th century. This was the era of Moral Treatment, developed in Europe during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], where the roots of occupational therapy lie.<ref name="peloquin">Peloquin, S. (1989). Moral Treatment: Contexts Considered. ''American Journal of Occupational Therapy,43''(8), p. 537-544</ref> Although it was thriving abroad, interest in the reform movement waxed and waned in the United States throughout the 19th century. It re-emerged in the early decades of the 20th century as Occupational Therapy. 

The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] that flourished between 1860 and 1910 also impacted occupational therapy. In a recently industrialized society, the arts and crafts societies emerged against the monotony and lost autonomy of factory work .<ref name="peloquin">Peloquin, S. (2005). The 2005 Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lecture-Embracing our methods, reclaiming our heart. ''American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 59'', 611-625</ref> Arts and crafts were utilized as a way of promoting learning through doing and provided an outlet for creative energy and a way of avoiding the boredom that was associated with long hospital stays, both for mental illness and for tuberculosis.

===Health profession===
The health profession of occupational therapy was conceived in the early 1910s as a reflection of the Progressive Era. Early professionals merged highly valued ideals, such as having a strong work ethic and the importance of crafting with one’s own hands with scientific and medical principles.<ref name="quiroga" /> The National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, now called the [[American Occupational Therapy Association]] (AOTA), was founded in 1917 and the profession of Occupational Therapy was officially named in 1920. 

The emergence of occupational therapy challenged the views of mainstream scientific medicine. Instead of focusing on purely physical etiologies, occupational therapists argued that a complex combination of social, economic, and biological reasons cause dysfunction. Principles and techniques were borrowed from many disciplines—including but not limited to [[nursing]], [[psychiatry]], [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]], [[self-help]], [[orthopedics]], and [[social work]]—to enrich the profession’s scope. Between 1900 and 1930, the founders defined the realm of practice and developed supporting theories. By the early 1930s, AOTA had established educational guidelines and accreditation procedures <ref name="colman">Colman, W. (1992). Maintaining autonomy: The struggle between occupational therapy and physical medicine. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 46, 63-70.</ref> In a short 20-year span, they successfully convinced the public and medical world of the value of occupational therapy and established standards for the profession.<ref name="quiroga" />

World War I forced the new profession to clarify its role in the medical domain and to standardize training and practice. In addition to clarifying its public image, occupational therapy also established clinics, workshops, and training schools nationwide. Due to the overwhelming number of wartime injuries, “reconstruction aides” (an umbrella term for occupational therapy aides and physiotherapy aides, now known as physical therapists) were recruited by the Surgeon General. Between 1917 and 1920, nearly 148,000 wounded men were placed in hospitals upon their return to the states. This number does not account for those wounded abroad. The success of the reconstruction aides, largely made up of women trying to “do their bit” to help with the war effort, was a great accomplishment. Post-war, however, there was a struggle to keep people in the profession. Emphasis shifted from the altruistic war-time mentality to the financial, professional, and personal satisfaction that comes with being a therapist. To make the profession more appealing, practice was standardized, as was the curriculum. Entry and exit criteria were established, and the American Occupational Therapy Association advocated for steady employment, decent wages, and fair working conditions. Via these methods, occupational therapy sought and obtained medical legitimacy in the 1920s.<ref name="quiroga" /> [[File:Occupational therapy psychiatric hospital.jpg|thumb|300px|Occupational therapy. Toy making in psychiatric hospital. World War 1 era.]] 

The profession has continued to grow and expand its scope and settings of practice. Occupational science, the study of occupation, was created in 1989 as a tool for providing evidence-based research to support and advance the practice of occupational therapy, as well as offer a basic science to study topics surrounding "occupation".<ref name="yerxa">Yerxa, E., Clark, F., Jackson, J., Pierce, D., & Zemke, R. (1989). An introduction to occupational science, A foundation for occupational therapy in the 21st century. Haworth Press.</ref>

==Evolution of the philosophy of occupational therapy==
The [[philosophy]] of occupational therapy has changed over the history of the profession. The philosophy articulated by the founders owed much to the ideals of [[romanticism]],<ref name="Hocking">Hocking, C (2004). Making a difference: The romance of occupational therapy. South African Journal of Occupational Therapy, 34(2), 3-5.</ref> [[pragmatism]]<ref name="Breines">Breines, E (1990). Genesis of occupation: A philosophical model for therapy and theory. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, 37(1), 45-49.</ref> and [[humanism]] which are collectively considered the fundamental ideologies of the past century.<ref name ="Yerxa">Yerxa, E J (1983). Audacious values: the energy source for occupational therapy practice in G. Kielhofner (1983) Health though occupation: Theory and practice in occupational therapy. Philadelphia, FA Davis.</ref><ref name="McColl">McColl, M A, Law, M., Stewart D., Doubt, L., Pollack, N and Krupa, T (2003). Theoretical basis of occupational therapy (2nd Ed).

Clinical reasoning in occupational therapy in Higgs J and Jones M (2000) Clinical reasoning in the health professions. 2nd ed. Oxford, Butterworth Heinemann Ltd.</ref>

One of the most widely cited early papers about the philosophy of occupational therapy was presented by [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], a psychiatrist who had emigrated to the United States from Switzerland in the late 19th century and who was invited to present his views to a gathering of the new Occupational Therapy Society in 1922. At the time, Dr. Meyer was one of the leading psychiatrists in the United States and head of the new psychiatry department and Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.<ref name ="Meyer">Meyer, A (1922).

Journal of Occupational Science 14(2),63‐76.</ref>

[[William Rush Dunton]], a supporter of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, now the American Occupational Therapy Association, sought to promote the ideas that occupation is a basic human need, and that occupation is therapeutic. From his statements came some of the basic assumptions of occupational therapy, which include:
* Occupation has a positive effect on health and well-being.
* Occupation creates structure and organizes time.
* Occupation brings meaning to life, culturally and personally.
* Occupations are individual. People value different occupations.<ref name="Townsend">Townsend, Elizabeth A. and Helene J Polatajko. (2007). [http://www.caot.ca/default.asp?pageid=1439 Enabling Occupation II: Advancing an Occupational Therapy Vision for Health, Well-Being & Justice Through Occupation.] Ottawa: CAOT Publications ACE. ISBN 978-1-895437-76-8</ref>

These philosophies have been elaborated on over time in order to form the values that underpin the Codes of Ethics issued by each national association. However, the relevance of occupation to health and well-being remains the central theme. Influenced by criticism from medicine and the multitude of physical disabilities resulting from [[World War II]], occupational therapy adopted a more [[reductionistic]] philosophy for a time. While this approach led to developments in technical knowledge about occupational performance, clinicians became increasingly disillusioned and re-considered these beliefs.<ref name="Turner">Turner, A.

</ref> Over the past century, the underlying philosophy of occupational therapy has evolved from being a diversion from illness, to treatment, to enablement through meaningful occupation.<ref name="Townsend"/> This became evident through the development and widespread adoption of the [[Canadian model of occupational performance|Canadian Model of Occupational Performance]].

The two most commonly mentioned values are that occupation is essential for health and the concept of [[holism]]. However, there have been some dissenting voices. Mocellin in particular advocated abandoning the notion of health through occupation as obsolete in the modern world and questioned the appropriateness of advocating holism when practice rarely supports it.<ref name="Mocellin1">Mocellin, G. (1988). A perspective on the principles and practice of occupational therapy. Generally they need to eat loads of bananas and chocolate.

British Journal of Occupational Therapy, 59(1), 11-16.</ref> The values formulated by the American Occupational Therapy Association have also been critiqued as being therapist centred and not reflecting the modern reality of multicultural practice.<ref name="Kielhofner">Kielhofner, G. (1997). Conceptual Foundations of Occupational Therapy. 2nd Ed. Philadelphia, F.A.Davis.</ref><ref name="Hocking/Whiteford"> Hocking, C and Whiteford, G (1995). Multiculturalism in occupational therapy: A time for reflection on core values. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, 42(4), 172-175.</ref>

Central to the philosophy of occupational therapy is the concept of occupational performance. In considering occupational performance the therapist must consider the many factors that comprise overall performance. This concept is made more tangible using models such as the person-environment-occupation model proposed by Law et al. (1996).<ref>The Person-Environment-Occupation Model, Law et al. (1996), Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy, vol 63 n1 p9-23 Apr 1996</ref> This approach highlights the importance of satisfactions in one's occupations, broadening the aim of occupational therapy beyond the mere completion of tasks to the holistic achievement of personal well-being.

In recent times occupational therapy practitioners have challenged themselves to think more broadly about the potential scope of the profession, and expanded it to include working with groups experiencing [[occupational deprivation]] which stems from sources other than disability.<ref>Occupational Therapy without borders:learning from the spirit of survivors, Kronenburg et al., Churchill Livingstone 2004</ref> Examples of new and emerging practice areas would include therapists working with [[refugee]]s,<ref name="Occupation">Occupation for Occupational Therapists, Matthew Molineux, Blackwell Publishing, 2004</ref> and with people experiencing [[homelessness]].<ref>The Process and Outcomes of a Multimethod needs assessment at a homeless shelter, Finlayson et al. (2002), American Journal of Occupational Therapy</ref>

The expanded version of the [[Canadian model of occupational performance and engagement]] (CMOP-E) encourages occupational therapists to think beyond just occupational performance and address other modes of occupational interaction such as occupational deprivation, competence, and justice. The broader notion of occupational engagement encompasses all that we do to become occupied and is congruent with how occupational therapists address issues of occupational enablement today.<ref name="Townsend"/>

==Enabling occupation==
Best practice in occupational therapy seeks to offer effective, client-centred services that enable people to engage in occupations of life. The Canadian Model of Client Centered Enablement (CMCE) embraces occupational enablement as the core competency of occupational therapy<ref name="Townsend"/> and the Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF)<ref name="Townsend"/> as the core process of occupational enablement.

==Occupational therapy process==
An occupational therapist works systematically through a sequence of actions known as the occupational therapy process. There are several versions of this process as described by numerous writers, although all include the basic components of evaluation, intervention, and outcomes. Creek<ref>Creek 2003 Occupational Therapy Defined as a Complex Intervention, London COT</ref> has sought to provide a comprehensive version based on extensive research which has 11 stages.

The Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF),<ref name="Townsend"/> has eight action points and three contextual elements.

Fearing, Law, and Clark<ref>Fearing,V.G., Law, M. & Clark, J. (1997). An occupational performance process model: Fostering client and therapist alliances. Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy, 64(11)</ref> suggested a 7 stage process. A central element of this process model is the focus on identifying both client and therapists strengths and resources prior to beginning to develop the outcomes and action plan.

The Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process (2nd edition) (AOTA, 2008) presents a 3 stage process, and includes interrelated constructs that define and guide practice.

==Areas of practice in occupational therapy==
The role of occupational therapy allows occupational therapists to work in many different settings, work with many different populations and acquire many different specialties. This broad spectrum of practice lends itself to difficulty categorizing the areas of practice that exist, especially considering the many countries and different health care systems. In this section, the categorization from the American Occupational Therapy Association is used. However, there are other ways to categorize areas of practice in OT, such as physical, mental, and community practice (AOTA, 2009). These divisions occur when the setting is defined by the population it serves. For example, acute physical or mental health settings (e.g.: hospitals), sub-acute settings (e.g.: aged care facilities), outpatient clinics and community settings.

In each area of practice below, an OT can work with different populations, diagnosis, specialities, and in different settings.

===Children and youth===
Occupational therapists work with infants, toddlers, children, and youth and their families in a variety of settings including schools, clinics, and homes.<ref name="aota.org">{{cite web|last=AOTA|title=Children and Youth|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/Pediatrics.aspx|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>  Occupational therapists assist children and their caregivers to build skills that enable them to participate in meaningful occupations.  Occupational therapists also address the psychosocial needs of children and youth to enable them to participate in meaningful life events.  These occupations may include: normal growth and development, feeding, play, social skills, and education.<ref name="Case-Smith 2010">{{cite book|last=Case-Smith|first=J.|title=Occupational Therapy for Children|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Maryland Heights, MO}}</ref>  

Occupational therapy with Children and Youth may take a variety of forms:<ref name="aota.org"/><ref name="Case-Smith 2010"/>

* Promoting a wellness program in schools to prevent childhood obesity
* Facilitating hand writing development in school-aged children
* Promoting functional skills for living in children with developmental disabilities
* Providing individualized treatment for sensory processing difficulties
* Addressing psychosocial needs of a child and teaching effective coping strategies

===Health and wellness===
The practice area of Health and Wellness is emerging steadily due to the increasing need for wellness-related services in occupational therapy. A connection between wellness and physical health, as well as mental health, has been found; consequently, helping to improve the physical and mental health of clients can lead to a general increase in wellness.<ref name="http">{{cite web|last=AOTA|title=Health and Wellness|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/Wellness.aspx}}</ref> 

As a practice area, health and wellness can include a focus on the following:<ref name="http"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brownson|first=C. A.|coauthors=Scaffa, M. E.|title=Occupational therapy in the promotion of health and the prevention of disease and disability statement|journal=American Journal of Occupational Therapy|year=2001|volume=55|issue=6|pages=656–660}}</ref>

* Prevention of disease and injury
* Prevention of secondary conditions
* Promotion of the well-being of those with chronic illnesses
* Reduction of health care disparities
* Enhancement of factors that impact quality of life
* Promotion of healthy living practices, social participation, and occupational justice

===Mental health===
According to the World Health Organization, mental illness is one of the fastest growing forms of disability.<ref>{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Mental Health Atlas 2011|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/publications/mental_health_atlas_2011/en/index.html|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>  There is a focus on prevention and treatment of mental illness in populations including children, youth, the aging, and those with severe and persistent mental health issues.<ref>{{cite web|last=AOTA|title=Mental Health|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/Practice}}</ref> Occupational therapists provide mental health services in a variety of settings including hospitals, day programs, and long-term-care facilities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Champagne|first=T.|title=Occupational therapy’s role in mental health recovery|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/ MentalHealth.aspx|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>   

Occupational therapists help individuals with mental illness acquire the skills to care for themselves or others including the following:<ref>{{cite book|last=Cara|first=E.|title=Psychosocial occupational therapy: a clinical practice|year=2005|publisher=Delmar Publishin|location=Clifton Park, NY}}</ref> 

* schedule maintenance
* routine building
* coping skills
* medication management
* employment
* education
* community access and participation
* social skills development
* leisure pursuits
* money management
* childcare

===Productive aging===
Occupational therapists work with older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives.  Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, continuing to live at home, low vision, and [[dementia]] or [[Alzheimer’s Disease]] (AD).<ref>{{cite web|last=Yamkovenko|first=S.|title=The emerging niche: What is next in your practice area?|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/EmergingAreas.aspx|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>  When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered to determine if drivers are safe behind the wheel.  To enable independence of older adults at home, occupational therapists perform fall screens and evaluate older adults functioning in their homes and recommend specific home modifications.  When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Warren|first=M.|title=Occupational therapy services for persons with visual impairment|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/Aging/Tools/38508.aspx?FT=.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>  While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensure safety, promote independence, and utilize retained abilities.<ref>{{cite web|last=AOTA|title=Alzheimer's Disease FAQ|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/Aging/FAQ/37281.aspx}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation===

Occupational therapists address the needs of rehabilitation, disability, and participation.  Occupational therapists provide treatment for adults with disabilities in a variety of settings including hospitals (acute rehabilitation, in-patient rehabilitation, and out-patient rehabilitation), home health, skilled nursing facilities, and day rehabilitation programs. When planning treatment, occupational therapists address the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and environmental needs involved in adult populations across a variety of settings.  

Occupational therapy with adult rehabilitation, disability, and participation may take a variety of forms: 

* Working with adults with autism at day rehabilitation programs to promote successful relationships and involvement in the community<ref>{{cite web|last=American Occupational Therapy Association|title=Autism in Adults|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/EmergingAreas/RDP/Autism.aspx}}</ref>
* Increasing the quality of life for a cancer survivor or individual with cancer by engaging them in occupations that are meaningful, providing therapy for lymphedema management, implementing anxiety and stress reduction methods, and fatigue management<ref name="Radomski 2008">{{cite book|last=Radomski|first=M.V.|title=Occupational Therapy for Physical Dysfunction|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|edition=6}}</ref>
* Training individuals with hand amputations how to put on and take off a myoelectrically controlled limb as well as training for functional use of the limb<ref name="Radomski 2008"/>
* Using and implementing new technology such as speech to text software and Nintendo Wii video games<ref>{{cite web|last=American Occupational Therapy Association|title=New Technology in Rehabilitation|url=http://www.aota.org/Practitioners/PracticeAreas/EmergingAreas/RDP/NewTech.aspx|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>

===Travel occupational therapy===
Because of the rising need for occupational therapists,<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/occupational-therapists.htm "Occupational Outlook Handbook: Occupational Therapists"]</ref> many facilities are opting for travel occupational therapists—who are willing to travel, often out of state, to work temporarily in a facility.  Assignments may run as short as 8 weeks or as long as 9 months, but typically last 13–26 weeks in length.<ref>[http://www.sunbeltstaffing.com/therapy-jobs/faqs/ "Therapy Frequently Asked Questions"]</ref>

===Work and industry===
Occupational therapists may also work with clients who have had an injury and are trying to get back to work. Testing may be completed to simulate work tasks in order to determine best matches for work, accommodations needed at work, or the level of disability. Work conditioning and hardening are approaches used to restore performance skills needed on the job that may have changed due to an illness or injury. Occupational therapists can also prevent work related injuries through ergonomics and on site work evaluations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clinger|first=Jeff|title=OT Services in Work Rehabilitation|url=http://www.aota.org|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>

==Occupational therapy approaches==
{{Prose|date=August 2009}}
Services typically include:
* Teaching new ways of approaching tasks<ref name="The Independent">The Independent Thursday 26th June 2003 Comment</ref>
* How to break down activities into achievable components e.g. sequencing a complex task like cooking a complex meal<ref name="The Independent"/>
* Comprehensive home and job site evaluations with adaptation recommendations.
* Performance skills assessments and treatment.
* Adaptive equipment recommendations and usage training.
* Environmental adaptation including provision of equipment or designing adaptations to remove obstacles or make them manageable<ref name="The Independent"/>
* Guidance to family members and caregivers.<ref name="AOTA">American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (2005).</ref>
* The use of creative media as therapeutic activity

===Activity analysis===
Activity analysis has been defined as a process of dissecting an activity into its component parts and task sequence in order to identify its inherent properties and the skills required for its performance, thus allowing the therapist to evaluate its therapeutic potential<ref>Creek 2003 Occupational Therapy defined as a complex intervention. London. COT</ref>

==Theoretical frameworks==
Occupational Therapists use a number of theoretical frameworks to frame their practice. Note that terminology has differed between scholars. Theoretical bases for framing a human and their occupation being include the following:

===Frames of reference and generic models===
Frames of reference or generic models are the overarching title given to a collation of compatible knowledge, research and theories that form conceptual practice.<ref>Foster, M. (2002) "Theoretical Frameworks", In: Occupational Therapy and Physical Dysfunction, Eds. Turner, Foster & Johnson.</ref> More generally they can be defined as "those aspects which influence our perceptions, decisions and practice".<ref>Rogers JC (1983), Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lecture. Clinical Reasoning; the ethics, science and art. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 37(9):601-616</ref>

* Person Environment Occupation Performance Model (PEOP) (Charles Christiansen & Carolyn Baum)
* Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model (OTIPM) (Anne Fisher and others)
* Occupational Performance Process Model (OPPM)
* Model of Human Occupation ([[MOHO]]) (Gary Kielhofner and others)
**MOHO was first published in 1980. It explains how people select, organise and undertake occupations within their environment. The model is supported with evidence generated over thirty years and has been successfully applied throughout the world.<ref>Kielhofner, G. (2008) ''Model of Human Occupation: Theory and Application''. 4th edn. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins</ref>
* Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E)
* Occupational Performances Model - Australia (OPM-A) (Chris Chapparo & Judy Ranka)
**The OPM(A) was conceptualized in 1986 with its current form launched in 2006. The OPM(A) illustrates the complexity of occupational performance, the scope of occupational therapy practice, and provides a framework for occupational therapy education.<ref>www.occupationalperformance.com</ref>
* Kawa (River) Model  (Michael Iwama)
* Functional Information-Processing Model
* Biomechanical Frame of Reference
**The Biomechanical Frame of Reference is primarily concerned with motion during occupation. It is used with individuals who experience limitations in movement, inadequate muscle strength or loss of endurance in occupations. The Frame of Reference was not originally compiled by Occupational Therapists, and Therapists should translate it to the Occupational Therapy perspective,<ref>McMillan, R. (2002) 'Assumptions Underpinning a Biomechanical Frame of Reference in Occupational Therapy' in Duncan (ed), Foundations for Practice in Occupational Therapy.

==Occupational therapy and ICF==
The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)]] is a framework to measure health and ability by illustrating how these components impact one’s function. This relates very closely to the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework as it is stated, “The profession’s core beliefs are in the positive relationship between occupation and health and its view of people as occupational beings”.<ref name="AOTA08">American Occupational Therapy Association. (2008). Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process (2nd ed). American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 62, 625-683.</ref> The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] is also built into the 2nd edition of the practice framework. Activities and participation examples from the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] overlap Areas of Occupation, Performance Skills, and Performance Patterns in the framework. The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] also includes contextual factors (environmental and personal factors) that relate to the context in the framework. In addition, body functions and structures classified within the ICF help describe the client factors as described in the OT framework<ref name="AOTA02">American Occupational Therapy Association. (2002). Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process. [[American Journal of Occupational Therapy]], 56, 609–639.</ref>

Further exploration of the relationship between occupational therapy and the components of the ICIDH-2 (revision of the original International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH); later becoming the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]]) was conducted by McLaughlin Gray.<ref name="mclaughlin">McLaughlin Gray, J. (2001). Discussion of the ICIDH-2 in relation to occupational therapy and occupational science. Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy, 8, 19-30.</ref> First, the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] is an international framework and provides an opportunity for the occupational therapy field to become better known across the globe. Second, the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] provides occupational therapists with a global language to describe their expertise to the larger international health care community. The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] uses a positive, holistic language emphasizing skills, capacities, and strengths of an individual rather than focusing on one’s deficits and disabilities. This is similar to the outlook of occupational therapists. Third, the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] includes environmental and personal contextual factors which are incorporated into the theory behind occupational therapy. It is important to take into consideration an individual’s personal, environmental, and occupational factors to develop an effective intervention.<ref name="Christiansen">Christiansen, C.H., & Baum, C.M. (2005). Occupational therapy: performance, participation, and well-being. New Jersey: Slack Inc.</ref> The last notable application of the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] to occupational therapy is the recognition of cultural patterns in occupation. Culture has significance on an individual’s activities and participation and it is important to keep this in mind when treating an individual.

Although the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] can be very useful for occupational therapists, it is noted in the literature that occupational therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary along with the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] in order to ensure correct communication about specific concepts.<ref name="Stamm">Stamm, T.A., Cieza, A., Machold, K., Smolen, J.S., & Stucki, G. (2006). Exploration of the link between conceptual occupational therapy models and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, 53, 9-17.</ref> The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] categories to occupational therapy terms. The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy vocabulary should not be replaced with [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] terminology<ref name="Haglund">Haglund, L., & Henriksson, C. (2003). Concepts in occupational therapy. Occupational Therapy International, 10, 253-268.</ref> The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.

==World Occupational Therapy Day==
October 27 is World Occupational Therapy Day and celebrates the many different ways occupational therapists can change the lives of others.<ref>World Federation of Occupational Therapists. (2010). World Occupational Therapy Day. http://www.wfot.org/aboutus/worldotday.aspx</ref> In honor of World Occupational Therapy Day, occupational therapists from around the world participate in an Occupational Therapy Global Day of Service (OTGDS) <ref>PromotingOT. Occupational Therapy Global Day of Service. promotingot.org</ref> This event gives occupational therapy practitioners and students worldwide the opportunity to give back to their communities through service and to promote the profession through helping others. Through social media, participants were also able to communicate with the global occupational therapy community to discuss their OTGDS activities and learn about how others are celebrating World Occupational Therapy Day. Providing free treatment, volunteering at local organizations, and participating in community events are some of the ways occupational therapists celebrate OTGDS and World Occupational Therapy Day.
