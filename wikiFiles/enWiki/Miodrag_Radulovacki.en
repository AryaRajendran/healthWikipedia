==Early life==
Miodrag Radulovacki was born in 1933, in [[Parage (Bačka Palanka)|Parage]], a village in northwestern [[Serbia]].  Both of his parents were [[elementary school]] [[teachers]].  At the beginning of [[World War II]], Dr. Radulovacki's father was drafted into the [[Royal Yugoslav Army|Yugoslav Army]] and was later taken prisoner by the invading [[Germans]].  From 1941 to 1944, Serbia, then part of [[Yugoslavia]], was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|occupied]] by the [[wehrmacht|German armed forces]].    

In 1943, when Dr. Radulovacki was 10 years old, he moved to [[Sremski Karlovci]]<ref name="sremski-karlovci">[http://www.sremski-karlovci.org.rs/www/index1.php Sremski Karlovci, Serbia]</ref> after his mother accepted a teaching position in the town.  Sremski Karlovci (also known as Karlovci), a historic [[baroque]] Serbian town on the banks of the [[Danube River]], had been home to the Radulovacki family for over 200 years.  Dr. Radulovacki attended [[Gymnasium of Karlovci|Karlovci High School]] or "Gymnasium," which is the oldest high school in Serbia.<ref name="youtube">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aTCYNaDTs0&feature=related "Our Foreigners" Weekly Television Program on Serbian station PTB1, Part 1: Biography of Dr. Miodrag Radulovacki]</ref><ref name="youtube_a">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkXH7HX_Vk "Our Foreigners" Weekly Television Program on Serbian station PTB1, Part 2: Biography of Dr. Miodrag Radulovacki]</ref>  Karlovci High School's famous patron was the [[Russia]]n [[czar]], [[Peter the Great]], who sent the school its first teachers and text books.  Dr. Radulovacki graduated as [[valedictorian]] of the Karlovci High School Class of 1951.  During his high school years, Dr. Radulovacki developed a deep interest in research and discoveries.  And, in order to pursue the best [[clinical research]] opportunities, Dr. Radulovacki enrolled in the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade School of Medicine|School of Medicine]].

==Education and scientific career==
Dr. Radulovacki graduated from the University of Belgrade School of Medicine in 1959.<ref name="medicine">[http://www.medicine.uic.edu/UserFiles/Servers/Server_442934/File/medcomm/FY09%20Contributors%20Report_FINAL.pdf Summary biography of Miodrag Radulovacki, Illinois Medicine Fiscal Year 2009 Report - Honor Roll of Donors, page 27 (Prizing Discovery)]</ref><ref name="uic">[http://www.uic.edu/nursing/CNSHR/NewFiles/radulovackiprofile.html University of Illinois, Dr. Miodrag Radulovacki profile]</ref><ref name="gradprofiles">[http://www.gradprofiles.com/u-ill-chi-pharmacology.html University of Illinois Department of Pharmacology Faculty Profiles]</ref>  He decided to pursue an academic career in basic sciences and went on to obtain a [[PhD]] in [[Neurophysiology]].<ref name="uic" /><ref name="gradprofiles" />  The topic of his PhD thesis was: ”Sleep in Split-Brain Cats,” partly done at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA.

===UCLA - Brain Research Institute (1964 - 1965)===
In order to gain broader experience in the field of sleep research, Dr. Radulovacki spent a year and a half at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) Brain Research Institute <ref>[http://www.bri.ucla.edu/ UCLA Brain Research Institute]</ref> where his mentor was Dr. Ross Adey.<ref>[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/williamrossadey.htm Tribute to Dr. Ross Adey]</ref>  One of the significant findings of his research at UCLA was that the [[electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] (EEG) pattern of sleep in cats with split brain to the [[pons]] is synchronous in both [[brain hemispheres]], indicating the importance of the [[brainstem]] in sleep regulation.<ref name="medicine" /><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fi8OzS0HD3cC&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=adey+radulovacki&source=bl&ots=kKUUVwnhD8&sig=weao22Y2vICu4agJOYCtXNcaXKY&hl=en&ei=4bnkTu_-Iobq0gHtt6DiBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=adey%20radulovacki&f=false Structure and function of the limbic system By W. Ross Adey, Toshihiko Tokizane, Tōkyō Daigaku. Igakubu. Nō Kenkyū Shisetsu, pages 228-229]</ref>

===University of Khartoum, Sudan (1966–1970)===
In 1966, Dr. Radulovacki accepted a teaching position with the [[Physiology]] Department in the College of Medicine at the [[University of Khartoum]], [[Sudan]].<ref name="medicine" />  It was there that he invented an approach for obtaining [[cerebrospinal fluid]] using a [[cannula]] to the [[cisterna magna]] in the brain of cats.  The cannulation method enabled researchers to obtain cerebrospinal fluid during sleep and wakefulness for the analysis of [[monoamine]] [[metabolites]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1197913 |year=1975 |last1=Buckingham |first1=RL |last2=Radulovacki |first2=M |title=The selective effects of alpha-methyl aromatic amino acids on brain monoamine metabolites and behavior in cats |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=255–65 |journal=Research communications in chemical pathology and pharmacology}}</ref>  This approach was of interest since [[Michel Jouvet]]’s [[Monoamine]] Theory of Sleep,<ref>[http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1993/A1993KP58900001.pdf Michel Jouvet's Monoamine Theory of Sleep]</ref> with [[serotonin]] as the sleep inducing agent, was dominant at the time.  Later, from 1970 to 1984, at the University of Illinois, Dr. Radulovacki published a series of papers dealing with the role of monoamines in sleep.<ref name="ncbi" />

===University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Medical School (1970 – present)===
In 1970, Dr. Radulovacki was recruited by Dr. Klaus Unna <ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-07-04/news/8702180843_1_mental-health-brain-sciences-national-institute Dr. Klaus Unna obituary, Chicago Tribune, July 4, 1987]</ref> to join the Department of Pharmacology in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago as an Assistant Professor.<ref name="medicine" />  Dr. Unna was a world authority on [[neuropharmacology]] which coincided with Dr. Radulovacki’s interest in the [[physiology]] and pharmacology of sleep.  Dr. Unna came from a long line of University Professors in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] who had made outstanding contributions to medicine.  His grandfather invented the [[Unna boot]], a special gauze bandage, which can be used for the treatment of [[venous]] insufficiencies of the leg.  And, Dr. Unna's mother discovered and described the [[dermatological]] [[disease]], [[Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis]].  With the benefit of the high caliber research environment created by Dr. Unna, Dr. Radulovacki has gone on to publish more than 170 scientific papers during his long academic career at the UIC.<ref name="ncbi" />

== Scientific achievements ==
=== Adenosine Sleep Theory ===
In 1984, Dr. Radulovacki postulated the Adenosine Sleep Theory, (JPET, 228: 268-274, 1984).<ref>[http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/228/2/268 Adenosine analogs and sleep in rats. M Radulovacki, R M Virus, M Djuricic-Nedelson and R D Green, JPET 1984]</ref>  The idea for adenosine’s role in sleep occurred to him after reading a paper by [[Solomon H. Snyder|Sol Snyder]]’s group (Proc. Natl. Acad.  Sci, 78: 3260-64, 1981)<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/78/5/3260.abstract?sid=db742f1b-ca23-4d89-9393-3d96e7056fdc Adenosine receptors and behavioral actions of methylxanthines,S H Snyder, J J Katims, Z Annau, R F Bruns, and J W Daly, PNAS 1981]</ref> about the importance of adenosine receptors in the behavioral actions of [[methylxanthine]]s. In the article, the authors correlated the behavioral excitation produced by [[theophylline]] in [[micromolar]] concentrations with the blockade of adenosine [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]. 

Dr. Radulovacki reasoned that if the blocking of adenosine receptors produces excitation, then perhaps stimulation of the same receptors could induce sleep.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1McDQwLB6hMC&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=miodrag+radulovacki&source=bl&ots=eY3bQcoFQl&sig=CJp_RTJrLM610ihueEza8oNSjlA&hl=en#v=onepage&q=miodrag%20radulovacki&f=false Role of adenosine in cerebral metabolism and blood flow]</ref>  He knew that experiments by John Phillis and his group (Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 57:1289-1312, 1979),<ref>[http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/y79-194 Effects of adenosine and adenine nucleotides on synaptic transmission in the cerebral cortex J. W. Phillis, J. P. Edstrom, G. K. Kostopoulos, J. R. Kirkpatrick]</ref> which utilized an [[iontophoretic]] application of adenosine in the brain, had demonstrated adenosine's [[depressant]] effect on the responses of [[neuron]]s in several brain regions and that the general [[neurophysiological]] effects of adenosine were shown to be inhibitory.  In addition, the preliminary experiments in dogs by Haulica ''et al.'' (J. Neurochem. 21:,1019–20, 1973)<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.1973.tb07549.x/abstract Preliminary data on the possible hypnogenic role of adenosine† Haulicǎ et al, Journal of Neurochemistry Volume 21, Issue 4, pages 1019–1020, October 1973]</ref> and the administration of adenosine into the brains of rats, cats and fowl suggested that adenosine was able to produce [[behavioral]] [[sleep]].  The explanation of adenosine's [[hypnotic]] effect was through its interaction with [[serotonin]], widely believed to be a sleep inducing agent.  However, since there was no suggestion how this adenosine-serotonin link was achieved, experiments highlighting the potential role of adenosine in sleep had largely been forgotten.

===Research collaboration with Dr. David W. Carley===
In 1993, Dr. Radulovacki started a long and fruitful collaboration with Dr. David W. Carley, a Professor of [[Medicine]], [[Bioengineering]] and Pharmacology at the UIC.  Their research efforts focused on developing pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep apnea.  [[Sleep apnea]], an involuntary cessation of breathing that occurs during sleep, affects at least 3% to 5% of the adult population in the [[United States]].  In addition, the prevalence of sleep-related apnea is dramatically elevated in the elderly, ranging from 28% to 67% of that population.<ref>[http://uic.edu/depts/mcph/lab_radulovacki.htm Radulovacki/Carley lab research.]</ref>  Sleep apnea can lead to [[high blood pressure]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[memory]] problems, [[weight gain]], [[headaches]] and death.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sleep-apnea/DS00148/DSECTION=risk-factors Sleep Apnea, Risk Factors]</ref>  Since there were no medicines to alleviate this condition, Drs. Carley and Radulovacki set out to develop a [[Pharmaceutical drug|drug treatment]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17310863 Efficacy of mirtazapine in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.] Carley DW, Olopade C, Ruigt GS, Radulovacki M.</ref>  Their initial work focussed on an [[experimental]] [[Conceptual model|model]] of sleep apnea in rats, initially testing the effects of adenosine compounds.<ref>[http://www.bookfinder.com/author/miodrag-radulovacki/ Sleep-related Breathing Disorders: Experimental Models And Therapeutic Potential by David W. Carley and Miodrag Radulovacki]</ref>  Eventually, they obtained positive results using serotonin and other compounds.  As a result, the UIC [[patent]]ed their discoveries, obtaining numerous US and international patents.<ref>[http://patent.ipexl.com/inventor/Miodrag_Radulovacki_1.html Patents by the UIC, Pharmacological Treatments for Sleep Disorders.]</ref>

===Inventor of the Year 2010===
Dr. Radulovacki was named the 2010 Inventor of the Year at the University of Illinois, alongside his research collaborator, Dr. David Carley.<ref name="bare_url" />   Drs. Carley and Radulovacki were honored by the University of Illinois for producing a dozen potential treatments for sleep apnea, many of which are now under consideration for commercial development.<ref>[http://usaserbs.net/news-usa/170-serb-is-inventor-of-the-year-in-illinois.html UIC OTM Announces 2010 Inventor of the Year]</ref>  Their ground-breaking results have culminated in an IllinoisVentures-supported startup company, Pier Pharmaceuticals, that focuses on the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.<ref>[http://www.pierpharmaceuticals.com/ Pier Pharmaceuticals web site Home Page]</ref>

===Membership in the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts===

In October 2003, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Belgrade elected Dr. Radulovacki as one of its Foreign Members.  Dr. Radulovacki received this distinction for his significant scientific research contributions in the fields of Neuropharmacology, sleep disorders and sleep-related breathing disorders.<ref name="sanu" /> Other foreign scientists elected to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts that same year were [[Noam Chomsky]] <ref>[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Clan.aspx?arg=1401, Noam Chomsky, Foreign Member, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]</ref>
from [[MIT]] and [[Nobel Laureate]], [[Stanley Prusiner]].<ref>[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Clan.aspx?arg=1206, Stanley Prusiner, Foreign Member, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]</ref>

==Yugoslav Student Summer Program==
In 1990, Dr. Radulovacki initiated the Yugoslav Student Summer Program at the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago (UIC) and the University of Illinois at [[Champagne-Urbana]] (UIUC) after the creation of International Linkage Agreements between the UIC and the Universities of Belgrade and [[Novi Sad]] in Yugoslavia.<ref>[http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/uisp/english/introduction.html The Yugoslav Student Summer Program at the University of Illinois]</ref>  The motivating force behind this program was to bring outstanding students from these Yugoslav Universities to the UIC and the UIUC for one month in order to introduce them to graduate programs and advanced research.  The Yugoslav Student Summer Program was successful due to its strict system of pre-selection and final selection of participants.  Participants were chosen on the basis of their academic success - only students with an average grade of 9.00 and higher (where the top grade was 10.00) were able to apply.  The final selection was done by Dr. Radulovacki on the basis of supplemental [[English language|English]] writing tests that he developed and which were administered every December at the two Yugoslav Universities.<ref>[http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/uisp/english/conditions.html Yugoslav Student Summer Program, Application Requirements]</ref>

The Yugoslav Student Summer Program lasted for 12 years and had 304 participants.<ref>[http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/uisp/english/participants.html Yugoslav Student Summer Program, Participants]</ref>  As a result of the Summer Program, at one point, over 100 students from Yugoslavia had been enrolled at the UIC and the UIUC graduate programs with full teaching assistantships.  More about the Yugoslav Summer Program can be found on the web site: http://mir.cs.uiuc.edu/uisp.

==Philanthropy==
Dr. Radulovacki is also a [[philanthropist]]. In 2005, Dr. Radulovacki established the Miodrag Radulovacki Family Prize for Excellence in Basic Sciences at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago.<ref name="medicine" />  The purpose of the prize, given annually, is to honor a fourth year Medical student who displays a high degree of intellectual integrity and who has demonstrated strong academic achievement.  The prize consists of a plaque and a check for $1,000.

In addition to the establishment of a scholarship at the UIC, Dr. Radulovacki made numerous contributions to his home town of [[Sremski Karlovci]],<ref name="sremski-karlovci" /> a city with a rich history on the banks of the Danube River in Serbia.  Throughout its history, Sremski Karlovci has been a leading Serbian cultural center, home to the first Serbian high school and the first [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] [[Theological Seminary]] (established soon after the founding of the [[Russian Orthodox]] Seminary in [[Kiev]]).  Sremski Karlovci was, for several centuries, the seat of the [[Serbian Patriarch]]y and has also served as the site for a number of important [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian National Assemblies]].<ref>[http://serbianempire.rs/2009/05/25/history-of-sremski-karlovci/ History of Sremski Karlovci]</ref> [[File:Fountain "Four Lions".jpg|250px|thumb|right|Four Lions Fountain, Sremski Karlovci, Serbia]]  

*In 2007, Dr. Radulovacki restored the symbol of Sremski Karlovci, a baroque fountain called the [[Fountain "Four Lions"|Four Lions Fountain]], located in the central square of the city.<ref name="youtube" /><ref name="youtube_a" />   The fountain was built in 1792 by the Italian architect [[Giuseppe Aprile]]. It survived both world wars but was in complete disrepair.  The fountain has been authentically reconstructed and augmented by elegant lighting.
  
*In 2009, Dr. Radulovacki restored the baroque façades of the Ecological Center in Karlovci <ref>[http://wikimapia.org/15049081/Hostel-ECO-CENTER, Ecological Center Karlovci]</ref><ref>[http://www.ekoloskicentar.org/images/kuca/large/011.jpg Picture of renovated baroque facade of the Ecological Center in Karlovci, Ecological Center Karlovci web site]</ref> which occupies a historic building in the center of the town.  The Ecological Center, among other things, serves as a [[youth hostel]] with 24 beds.<ref name="youtube" /><ref name="youtube_a" />  The Ecological Center moved to Karlovci from Novi Sad, the capital of the northern Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] (Voyvodina), in order to accommodate participants in the national and international youth camps held annually in Karlovci.
  
*In 2010, Dr. Radulovacki restored the monument of a popular Serbian poet, [[Branko Radičević]] (Radichevich), at [[Stražilovo]] (Strazhilovo) which is located on a mountain-top surrounded by forests in the [[Fruška Gora]] (Frushka Gora) [[National Park]]  near Karlovci.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH5Jo9ZjkYM News report about the restoration of the Branko Radičević monument by Dr. Miodrag Radulovacki on Serbian TV station PTB1]</ref>  Only two Serbian poets have their graves and monuments on the top of mountains: [[Petar Petrović Njegoš]] (Petar Petrovich Nyegosh) on the top of [[Lovćen]] (Lovchen) mountain in [[Montenegro]] and Branko Radičević at Stražilovo.

*In 2011, Dr. Radulovacki also financed the construction of a self-sustaining ecological building with [[solar panels]] and [[geothermal heat pump]]s in the courtyard of the Karlovci Ecological Center.<ref>[http://www.ekoloskicentar.org/pgv/en/ Ecological Center Karlovci newsletter and update on the new construction project]</ref>  In recognition of Dr. Radulovacki's philanthropy, the ecological center was recently renamed, the Ecological Center Radulovački.

==Personal life==
Dr, Radulovacki lives in [[Chicago]].  He is an avid [[cross country skier]] <ref name="uic" /> and belongs to the Lake Shore Ski and Sports Club.<ref>[http://www.lssc.org/ Lake Shore Ski and Sports Club]</ref>  He participated in several Birkebeiner-Kortelopet cross-country ski marathons in Cable-Hayward, [[Wisconsin]].  He has two sons.
