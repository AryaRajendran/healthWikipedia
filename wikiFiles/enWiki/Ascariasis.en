'''Ascariasis''' is a [[disease]] of humans caused by the [[parasite|parasitic]] [[roundworm]] ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]''. Perhaps as many as one quarter of the world's population are infected, with a prevalence of 45% in Latin America and 95% in parts of Africa.<ref>Berger SA, Marr JS. Human Parasitic Diseases Sourcebook. Jones and Bartlett Publishers: Sudbury, Massachusetts, 2006.</ref>  Ascariasis is particularly prevalent in [[tropics|tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] regions where [[hygiene]] is poor. Other [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Ascaris]]'' can cause disease in domestic animals, such as ''[[Ascaris suum]]'' which infects pigs. Some genes have been identified in humans that may increase susceptibility to infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams-Blangero S |title=Genes on chromosomes 1 and 13 have significant effects on Ascaris infection |journal=Proc.

[[Infection]] occurs by swallowing food contaminated with ''Ascaris'' [[egg (biology)|eggs]] from feces. The [[larvae]] hatch in the [[intestine]], burrow through the gut wall, and migrate to the [[lungs]] through the blood system.<ref name=Crompton1> Crompton, D.W. and Pawlowski, Z. (1985).

Nesheim, M.C. and Pawlowski, Z.S. London: Taylor & Francis </ref>  There they break into the [[alveoli]] and pass up the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[oesophagus]] where they are coughed up and swallowed.  The larvae pass through the stomach for a second time into the intestine where they mature into adult worms.  They maintain their position by swimming against the intestinal flow caused by [[peristalsis]].<ref name=Crompton1/> Adult worms have a life-span of 1-2 years which means that individuals may be infected all their lives as worms die and new worms are acquired.<ref name=Anderson1> Anderson, R.M. & May, R.M. (1991).  Infectious diseases of humans. Dynamics and control. Oxford: Oxford Scientific Publications </ref>

Infections are usually asymptomatic, especially if the number of worms is small, because the degree of disease is related to the number of worms in the intestine as well as to the size and health of the human host.  It is typical to find that most individuals harbour a small number of worms, while a small proportion are heavily infected, something that is characteristic of many worm infections.<ref name=Anderson1/>  The distribution of ''A.lumbricoides'' among human hosts is best described empirically by the [[negative binomial distribution]].<ref name=Hall1>{{cite journal | author = Hall A., Anwar K.S., Tomkins A., Rahman L. | year = 1999 | title = The distribution of Ascaris lumbricoides in human hosts: a study of 1765 people in Bangladesh | url = | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 93 | issue = 5| pages = 503–510 }}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==

As larval stages travel through the body, they may cause visceral damage, [[peritonitis]] and [[inflammation]], enlargement of the [[liver]] or [[spleen]], and a verminous [[pneumonitis]].  The worms in the intestine may cause [[malabsorption]] and [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] which contribute to [[malnutrition]].<ref name=Hall2>{{cite journal | author = Hall A., Hewitt G., Tuffrey V. | year = 2008 | title = A review and meta-analysis of the impact of intestinal worms on child growth and nutrition | url = | journal = Maternal and Child Nutrition | volume = 4 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 118–236 }}</ref>  The malabsorption may be due to a loss of brush border enzymes, erosion and flattening of the villi, and inflammation of the [[lamina propria]].<ref name=Stephenson1> Stephenson, L.S. (1987). The Impact of Helminth Infections on Human Nutrition. London: Taylor & Francis. </ref> The worms can occasionally cause intestinal blockage when large numbers get tangled into a bolus or they may migrate from the small intestine, which may require surgery. More than 796 ''Ascaris lumbricoides'' worms weighing up to 550&nbsp;g [19 ounces] were recovered at autopsy from a 2-year-old South African girl. The worms had caused torsion and gangrene of the [[ileum]], which was interpreted as the cause of death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baird JK, Mistrey M, Pimsler M, Connor DH |title=Fatal human ascariasis following secondary massive infection |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=314–8 |year=1986 |month=March |pmid=3953945 |doi= |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3953945}}</ref>

In many parts of the world ascariasis is a pandemic. Many patients are diagnosed accidentally. Sometimes the worm blocks the Ampulla of Vater or goes into the Main Pancreatic Duct resulting in acute pancreatitis with raised serum levels of Amylase and Lipase. Occassionally they can travel through the Billiary tree and even into the gallbladder causing Acute Cholangitis or Acute Cholecystitis.
''Ascaris'' takes most of its nutrients from the partially digested host food in the [[intestine]]. There is some evidence that it can secrete anti-enzymes, presumably to protect itself from digestion by the hosts' enzymes.

In Canada in 1970, a postgraduate student tainted his roommates' food with ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]''. Four of the victims became seriously ill; two of these suffered acute respiratory failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phills JA, Harrold AJ, Whiteman GV, Perelmutter L |title=Pulmonary infiltrates, asthma and eosinophilia due to ''Ascaris suum'' infestation in man |journal=N.

== Mechanism ==
=== Life cycle ===

[[Image:Ascariasis LifeCycle - CDC Division of Parasitic Diseases.gif|thumb|right|Adult worms (1) live in the lumen of the small intestine. A female may produce approximately 200,000 eggs per day, which are passed with the feces (2). Unfertilized eggs may be ingested but are not infective. Fertile eggs embryonate and become infective after 18 days to several weeks (3), depending on the environmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil). After infective eggs are swallowed (4), the larvae hatch (5), invade the intestinal mucosa, and are carried via the portal, then systemic circulation and/or lymphatics to the lungs . The larvae mature further in the lungs (6) (10 to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed (7). Upon reaching the small intestine, they develop into adult worms (8). Between 2 and 3 months are required from ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female. Adult worms can live 1 to 2 years.]]First appearance of eggs in stools is 60–70 days. In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4–16 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. However there are generally few or no symptoms. A [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause [[pneumonitis]] and [[eosinophilia]].

=== Source ===

The source of transmission is from soil and vegetation on which fecal matter containing eggs has been deposited. Ingestion of infective eggs from soil contaminated with human feces or transmission and contaminated vegetables and water is the primary route of infection. Intimate contact with pets which have been in contact with contaminated soil may result in infection, while pets which are infested themselves by a different type of roundworm can cause infection with that type of worm (Toxocara canis, etc.) as occasionally occurs with groomers.

Transmission also comes through municipal recycling of wastewater into crop fields. This is quite common in emerging industrial economies, and poses serious risks for not only local crop sales but also exports of contaminated vegetables. A 1986 outbreak of ascariasis in [[Italy]] was traced to irresponsible wastewater recycling used to grow [[Balkan]] vegetable exports.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pawlowski | first = ZS | coauthors = Schultzberg K | chapter =Ascariasis and sewage in Europe| editor = Block JC | title=Epidemiological Studies of Risks Associated With the Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge: Knowledge and Needs (EUR) |publisher=Elsevier Science Pub Co |location= |year=1986 |pages=83–93 |isbn=1-85166-035-6 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>

Transmission from human to human by direct contact is impossible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/ascaris/factsht_ascaris.htm#contagious |title=''Ascaris'' Infection Fact Sheet |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==

The diagnosis is usually incidental when the host passes a worm in the stool or vomit.  The eggs can be seen in smear of fresh feces examined on a glass slide under a microscope and there are various techniques to concentrate them first or increase their visibility, such as the ether sedimentation method or the [[Kato technique]]. The eggs have a characteristic shape.  During pulmonary disease larvae may be found in fluids aspirated from the lungs. White blood cells counts may demonstrate peripheral [[eosinophilia]], but this is common in many parasitic infections and is not specific to ascariasis. On [[X-ray]], 15–35&nbsp;cm long filling defects, sometimes with whirled appearance (bolus of worms).

== Prevention ==

Prevention includes: use of [[toilet]] facilities; safe excreta disposal; protection of food from dirt and soil; thorough washing of produce; and hand washing.

Food dropped on the floor should never be eaten without washing or cooking, particularly in endemic areas. Fruits and vegetables should always be washed thoroughly before consumption.

== Treatment ==
{{main|Ascaricide}}

Pharmaceutical drugs that are used to kill roundworms are called [[ascaricide]]s and include:

* [[Mebendazole]] (Vermox) (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>13</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Causes slow immobilization and death of the worms by selectively and irreversibly blocking uptake of glucose and other nutrients in susceptible adult intestine where helminths dwell. Oral dosage is 100&nbsp;mg 12 hourly for 3 days.
* [[Piperazine]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>.C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). A flaccid paralyzing agent that causes a blocking response of ascaris muscle to acetylcholine. The narcotizing effect immobilizes the worm, which prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces. Dosage is 75&nbsp;mg/kg (max 3.5 g) as a single oral dose.
* [[Pyrantel pamoate]] (Antiminth, Pin-Rid, Pin-X) (C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S.C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) Depolarizes ganglionic block of nicotinic neuromuscular transmission, resulting in spastic paralysis of the worm. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular pyrantel pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Dosage is 11&nbsp;mg/kg not to exceed 1 g as a single dose.
* [[Albendazole]] (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S) A broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent that decreases [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production in the worm, causing energy depletion, immobilization, and finally death. Dosage is 400&nbsp;mg given as single oral dose (contraindicated during pregnancy and children under 2 years).
* [[Thiabendazole]]. This may cause migration of the worm into the [[esophagus]], so it is usually combined with piperazine.
* [[Hexylresorcinol]] effective in single dose, mentioned in : Holt, Jr Emmett L, McIntosh Rustin: Holt's Diseases of Infancy and Childhood: A Textbook for the Use of Students and Practitioners. Appleton and Co, New York,11th edition
* [[Santonin]], more toxic than [[hexylresorcinol]], mentioned in : Holt, Jr Emmett L, McIntosh Rustin: Holt's Diseases of Infancy and Childhood: A Textbook for the Use of Students and Practitioners. Appleton and Co, New York, 11th edition
* [[Oil of chenopodium]], more toxic than [[hexylresorcinol]], mentioned in : Holt, Jr Emmett L, McIntosh Rustin: Holt's Diseases of Infancy and Childhood: A Textbook for the Use of Students and Practitioners. Appleton and Co, New York, 11th edition

Also, [[corticosteroids]] can treat some of the symptoms, such as inflammation. In some cases with severe infestation, the sudden death of the worms may cause [[bowel obstruction]], requiring surgical intervention.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/451597_3</ref>

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have traditionally used [[epazote]] (''Chenopodium ambrisioides'') for treatment, which was not as powerful as pharmaceutical compounds, but spontaneous passage of Ascarids provided some proof of efficacy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Roughly 1.5 billion individuals are infected with this worm, primarily in Africa and Asia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crompton DW |title=How much human helminthiasis is there in the world? |journal=J.

One study indicated that the prevalence of ascariasis in the United States at about 4 million (2%) [8]. In a survey of a rural [[Nova Scotia]] ([[Canada]]) community, 28.1% of 431 individuals tested were positive for ''Ascaris'', all of them being under age 20, while all 276 tested in metropolitan [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]] were negative.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Embil JA, Pereira LH, White FM, Garner JB, Manuel FR |title=Prevalence of ''Ascaris'' lumbricoides infection in a small Nova Scotian community |journal=Am.

Deposition of [[ovum|ova]] (eggs) in [[sewage]] hints at the degree of ascariasis incidence. A 1978 study showed about 75% of all sewage [[sludge]] samples sampled in United States urban catchments contained ''Ascaris'' ova, with rates as high as 5 to 100 eggs per litre {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In [[Frankfort, Indiana|Frankfort]], [[Indiana]], 87.5% of the sludge samples were positive with ''Ascaris'', ''[[Toxocara]]'', ''[[trichinosis|Trichuris]]'', and [[hookworm]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

Ascariasis can often be measured by examining food for ova. In one field study in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], where raw sewage is used to fertilize crop fields, ''Ascaris'' eggs were detected at the rate of 0.18 eggs/kg in potatoes, 0.27 eggs/kg in turnip, 4.63 eggs/kg in mint, 0.7 eggs/kg in carrots, and 1.64 eggs/kg in radish.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Habbari K, Tifnouti A, Bitton G, Mandil A |title=Helminthic infections associated with the use of raw wastewater for agricultural purposes in Beni Mellal, Morocco |journal=East.
