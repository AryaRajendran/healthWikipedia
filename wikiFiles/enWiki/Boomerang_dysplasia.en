Osteochondrodysplasias are skeletal disorders that cause malformations of both bone and [[cartilage]].

==Characteristics==
Prenatal and neonatal diagnosis of boomerang dysplasia includes several prominent features found in other osteochondrodysplasias, though the "boomerang" malformation seen in the [[long bone]]s is the delineating factor.<ref name=boom/> 

Featured symptoms of boomerang dysplasia include: [[dwarfism]]<ref name=bd90>{{cite journal |author=Winship I, Cremin B, Beighton P |title=Boomerang dysplasia |journal=Am J Med Genet. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=440–443 |year=1990 |pmid=2202214 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320360413 }}</ref> (a lethal type of [[infant]]ile dwarfism caused by systemic [[osteochondrodysplasia|bone deformities]]),<ref name=ldwarf>{{cite journal |author=Kozlowski K, Tsuruta T, Kameda Y, Kan A, Leslie G |title=New forms of neonatal death dwarfism.

The characteristic "boomerang" malformation presents intermittently among random absences of long bones throughout the skeleton, in affected individuals.<ref name=bd90/><ref name=bd85>{{cite journal |doi=10.1259/0007-1285-58-688-369 |author=Kozlowski K, Sillence D, Cortis-Jones R, Osborn R |title=Boomerang dysplasia |journal=Brit J Radiol. |volume=58 |issue= 688|pages=369–371 |year=1985 |pmid=4063680 }}</ref> For example, one individual may have an absent [[radius]] and [[fibula]], with the "boomerang" formation found in both [[ulna]]s and [[tibia]]s.<ref name=bd85/> Another patient may present "boomerang" [[femur|femora]], and an absent [[tibia]].<ref name=bd90/>

==Cause==

Mutations in the ''Filamin B ([[FLNB]])'' gene cause boomerang dysplasia.<ref name=mutbd/> FLNB is a [[cytoplasm]]ic [[protein]] that regulates intracellular communication and signalling by cross-linking the protein [[actin]] to allow direct communication between the [[cell membrane]] and [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal network]], to control and guide proper skeletal development.<ref name=filb>{{cite journal |author=Lu J, Lian G, Lenkinski R, De Grand A, Vaid RR, Bryce T, Stasenko M, Boskey A, Walsh C, Sheen V |title=Filamin B mutations cause chondrocyte defects in skeletal development |journal=Hum Mol Genet. |volume=16 |issue=14 |pages=1661–1675 |year=2007 |pmid=17510210 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm114 }}</ref> Disruptions in this pathway, caused by FLNB [[mutation]]s, result in the bone and cartilage abnormalities associated with boomerang dysplasia. 

[[Chondrocyte]]s, which also have a role in bone development, are susceptible to these disruptions and either fail to undergo [[ossification]], or ossify incorrectly.<ref name=mutbd/><ref name=filb/> 

FLNB mutations are involved in a spectrum of [[osteochondrodysplasia|lethal bone dysplasias]]. One such disorder, [[atelosteogenesis type I]], is very similar to boomerang dysplasia, and several symptoms of both often overlap.<ref name=bddom/><ref name=lbdys>{{cite journal |author=Greally MT, Jewett T, Smith WL Jr., Penick GD, Williamson RA |title=Lethal bone dysplasia in a fetus with manifestations of Atelosteogenesis type I and Boomerang dysplasia |journal=Am J Med Genet. |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1086–1091 |year=1993 |pmid=8291529 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320470731 }}</ref>

==Genetics==
[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Boomerang dysplasia has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.]]
Early journal reports of boomerang dysplasia suggested [[X-linked]] [[recessive]] [[inheritance]], based on observation and family history.<ref name=bd90/> It was later discovered, however, that the disorder is actually caused by a [[wikt:sporadic|sporadic]] genetic [[mutation]] fitting an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance relationship|dominant]] genetic profile.<ref name=bddom>{{cite journal |author=Nishimura G, Horiuchi T, Kim OH, Sasamoto Y |title=Atypical skeletal changes in otopalatodigital syndrome type II: phenotypic overlap among otopalatodigital syndrome type II, boomerang dysplasia, atelosteogenesis type I and type III, and lethal male phenotype of Melnick-Needles syndrome |journal=Am J Med Genet. |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=132–138 |year=1997 |pmid=9409862 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19971212)73:2<132::AID-AJMG6>3.0.CO;2-W }}</ref>

Autosomal dominant inheritance indicates that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and only one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.

Boomerang dysplasia, although an autosomal dominant disorder,<ref name=bddom/> is ''not'' inherited because those afflicted do not live beyond infancy.<ref name=mutbd/> They cannot pass the gene to the next generation.
