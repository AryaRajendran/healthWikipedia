'''Edwards syndrome''' (also known as '''Trisomy 18''' ['''T18''']) is a [[genetic disorder]] caused by the presence of all or part of an extra [[chromosome 18 (human)|18th chromosome]]. This genetic condition almost always results from [[nondisjunction]] during [[meiosis]]. It is named after [[John Hilton Edwards]], who first described the syndrome in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3438.html|title=Edwards syndrome (John Hilton Edwards)|publisher=WhoNamedIt.com|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> It is the second most common [[autosome|autosomal]] [[trisomy]], after [[Down's syndrome]], that carries to term.

Edwards syndrome occurs in around one in 6,000 live births and around 80 percent of those affected are female.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/edwardssyndrome2.shtml |title=Health: Edwards syndrome |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> The majority of fetuses  with the syndrome die before birth.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The incidence increases as the [[Advanced maternal age|mother's age increases]]. The syndrome has a very low rate of survival, resulting from heart abnormalities, kidney malformations, and other internal organ disorders.

==Signs and symptoms==
Children born with Edwards syndrome may have some or all of the following characteristics: kidney malformations, structural heart defects at birth (i.e., [[ventricular septal defect]], [[atrial septal defect]], [[patent ductus arteriosus]]), intestines protruding outside the body ([[omphalocele]]), [[esophageal atresia]], [[mental retardation]], developmental delays, growth deficiency, [[feeding difficulties]], [[breathing difficulties]], and [[arthrogryposis]] (a muscle disorder that causes multiple joint contractures at birth).<ref name="What is"/><ref name="medline">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/article/001661.htm|title=Trisomy 18|publisher=Medline|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

Some physical malformations associated with Edwards syndrome include small head ([[microcephaly]]) accompanied by a prominent back portion of the head ([[occiput]]); low-set, malformed ears; abnormally small jaw ([[micrognathia]]); [[cleft lip]]/[[cleft palate]]; upturned nose; narrow eyelid folds ([[palpebral fissures]]); widely spaced eyes ([[ocular hypertelorism]]); drooping of the upper eyelids ([[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]); a short breast bone; clenched hands; choroid plexus cysts; underdeveloped thumbs and or nails, [[absent radius]], [[Webbed toes|webbing]] of the second and third [[toes]]; [[clubfoot]] or ''[[Rocker bottom feet]]''; and in [[males]], [[undescended testicles]].<ref name="What is">{{cite web|url=http://www.trisomy18.org/site/PageServer?pagename=parents_whatisT18|title=What is Trisomy 18?|publisher=Trisomy 18 Foundation|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref><ref name="medline" />

In utero, the most common characteristic is cardiac anomalies, followed by central nervous system anomalies such as head shape abnormalities. The most common intracranial anomaly is the presence of [[choroid plexus cysts]], which are pockets of fluid on the brain. These are not problematic in themselves, but their presence may be a marker for trisomy 18.<ref name="pmid17357350">{{cite journal |author=Hurt K, Sottner O, Záhumenský J, ''et al.'' |title=[Choroid plexus cysts and risk of trisomy 18.

==Genetics==

Edwards syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the [[Chromosome 18 (human)|18th chromosome]], either in whole ([[trisomy]] 18) or in part (such as due to [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]). The additional chromosome usually occurs before [[Fertilisation|conception]]. The effects of the extra copy vary greatly, depending on the extent of the extra copy, genetic history, and chance. Edwards syndrome occurs in all human populations but is more prevalent in female offspring.<ref name="emed">{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic652.htm#section~Introduction|title=Introduction to Trisomy 18|last=Chen, MD|first=Harold |publisher=EMedicine|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

A healthy egg and/or sperm cell contains individual chromosomes, each of which contributes to the 23 pairs of chromosomes needed to form a normal cell with a typical human [[karyotype]] of 46 chromosomes. Numerical errors can arise at either of the two [[meiotic]] divisions and cause the failure of a chromosome to segregate into the daughter cells ([[nondisjunction]]). This results in an extra chromosome, making the [[haploid]] number 24 rather than 23. Fertilization of eggs or insemination by sperm that contain an extra chromosome results in trisomy, or three copies of a chromosome rather than two.<ref>For a description of human karyotype see {{cite web |author=Mittleman, A. (editor) |year=1995 |url=http://www.iscn1995.org/ |title=An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomeclature |accessdate = 2006-06-04}}</ref>

Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) is caused by a [[Meiosis|meiotic]] [[nondisjunction]] event. With [[nondisjunction]], a [[gamete]] (''i.e.'', a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 18; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the [[embryo]] has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 18.

A small percentage of cases occur when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in a mixed population of cells with a differing number of chromosomes. Such cases are sometimes called [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] Edwards syndrome. Very rarely, a piece of chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome ([[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]]) before or after conception. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18 plus extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 18, and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical Edwards syndrome.

==Prognosis==
In 2008/2009, there were 495 diagnoses of Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) in [[England]] and [[Wales]], 92% of which were made [[Prenatal development|prenatally]]. There were 339 [[Abortion|abortions]], 49 [[stillbirths]]/[[miscarriages]]/[[Perinatal mortality|fetal deaths]], 72 unknown outcomes, and 35 live births.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/ndscr/|title=National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register Annual Reports 2008/09}}</ref>  Because approximately 3% of cases with unknown outcomes are likely to result in a live birth, the total number of live births is estimated to be 37 (2008/09 data are provisional).  Major causes of death include [[apnea]] and heart abnormalities. It is impossible to predict an exact [[prognosis]] during [[pregnancy]] or the [[Neonate|neonatal period]].<ref name="emed" /> Half of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001661.htm |title=Trisomy 18: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-12-14 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> The [[median]] lifespan is 5–15 days.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodeck|first=Charles H. |coauthors=Whittle, Martin J. |title=Fetal Medicine: Basic Science and Clinical Practice|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=1999|isbn=0-443-05357-X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0BY0hx2l5uoC&pg=PA555&dq=Trisomy+18#PPA555,M1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYD/is_5_38/ai_98830102|title=Trisomy 13 survival can exceed 1 year|last=Zoler|first=Mitchel L. |date= March 1, 2003|publisher=OB/GYN News|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> About 8% of infants survive longer than 1 year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYD/is_5_38/ai_98830102/ |title=Trisomy 13 survival can exceed 1 year &#124; OB/GYN News |publisher=Find Articles |date=2003-03-01 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> One percent of children live to age 10, typically in less severe cases of the [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] Edwards syndrome.<ref name="emed"/> Parents with surviving children who take part in support groups report that these children enriched their family and their couple irrespective of the length of their lives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janvier|first=Annie|coauthors=Farlow Wilfond|title=The experience of families with children with trisomy 13 and 18 in social networks.|journal=Pediatrics|date=July 23, 2012|month=Aug|volume=130|issue=2|pages=293–298|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-0151|pmid=22826570|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22826570}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Edwards syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 6,000 live births, but more conceptions are affected by the syndrome because the majority of those diagnosed with the condition prenatally will not survive the prenatal period.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Edward%27s-Syndrome.htm |title=Edwards' Syndrome &#124; Doctor &#124; Patient UK |publisher=Patient.co.uk |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> Although women in their 20s and early 30s may conceive babies with Edwards syndrome, the risk of conceiving a child with Edwards syndrome increases with a woman's age.
