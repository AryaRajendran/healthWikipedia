'''Perimetry'''  or '''[[Campimeter|campimetry]]''' is one way to systematically test the visual field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visual Field|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003879.htm|work=NIH, US National Library of Medicine|publisher=Medline Plus|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>  It is the systematic measurement of differential light sensitivity in the [[visual field]] by the detection of the presence of test targets on a defined background.  Perimetry more carefully maps and quantifies the visual field, especially at the extreme periphery of the visual field.  The name comes from the method of testing the ''perimeter'' of the visual field.

[[Visual field testing]] can be performed clinically by keeping the subject's gaze fixed while presenting objects at various places within their [[visual field]].  Simple manual equipment can be used such as in the tangent screen test or the [[Amsler grid]].  When dedicated machinery is used it is called a perimeter.

==Uses==
Automated perimeters are used widely, and applications include: diagnosing disease, job selection, visual competence assessment, school or community screenings, military selection, and disability classifications.<ref>{{cite web|title=1990 Perimetry Standards|url=http://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/ips/GEN-INFO/standards/IPS90.HTM|work=First Codicil|publisher=Imaging and Perimetry Society|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>

==Types of perimetry==
[[File:Goldmann Perimeter.png|thumb |alt=Golddmann Perimeter |Goldmann Perimeter]]

===Tangent screen===
The simplest form of perimetry uses a white tangent screen.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  Vision is tested by presenting different sized pins attached to a black wand, which may be moved, against a black background.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  This test stimulus (pins) may be white or colored.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />

===Goldmann perimeter===
The Goldmann perimeter is a hollow white spherical bowl positioned a set distance in front of the patient.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  An examiner presents a test light of variable size and intensity.  The light may move towards the center from the perimeter (kinetic perimetry), or it may remain in one location (static perimetry).  The Goldmann method is able to test the entire range of peripheral vision, and has been used for years to follow vision changes in [[glaucoma]] patients.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  However, now automated perimetry is more commonly used.

===Automated perimetry===
Automated perimetry uses a mobile stimulus moved by an perimetry machine.  The patient indicates whether they see the light by pushing a button.  The use of a white background and lights of incremental brightness is called "white-on-white" perimetry.  This type of perimetry is the most commonly used in clinical practice, and in research trials where loss of visual field must be measured.<ref name=RecentDevPerimetry />  However, the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of white-on-white perimetry is low, and the variability is relatively high; as many as 25-50 percent of the photoreceptive [[retinal ganglion cells]] may be lost before changes in visual field acuity are detected.<ref name=RecentDevPerimetry>{{cite journal|last=McKendrick|first=Allison M|title=Recent developments in perimetry: test stimuli and procedures|journal=Clinical and Experimental Optometry|year=2005|month=March|volume=88|issue=2|pages=73–80|doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2005.tb06671.x|pmid=15807638|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1444-0938.2005.tb06671.x/abstract|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

===Microperimeter===
The microperimeter assesses the macular function in a computerised way.
A 2012 [[observational study]] by Pacella et al.<ref name="Pacella 2012">{{cite journal| last=Pacella| first=E| last2=Pacella| first2=F| last3=Mazzeo| firs3t=F| last4=Turchetti| first4=P| last5=Carlesimo| first5=SC| last6=Cerutti| first6=F| last7=Lenzi| first7=T| last8=De Paolis| first8=G| last9=Giorgi| first9=D| title=Effectiveness of vision rehabilitation treatment through MP-1 microperimeter in patients with visual loss due to macular disease| journal=Clin Ter| date=November 2012| pages=163(6):e423–8| pmid=23306757}}</ref>{{Primary source-inline|date=January 2013}} found a significant improvement in both [[visual acuity]] and [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]] treating [[age-related macular degeneration]] or [[macular myopic degeneration]] with biofeedback treatment through MP-1 microperimeter.

==Methods of stimulus presentation==

===Static perimetry===
Static perimetry tests different locations throughout the field one at a time.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth>{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Emmett T.|coauthor=Paul Riordan-Eva|title=Vaughan & Asbury's general ophthalmology.|chapter=Chapter 2: Ophthalmologic Evaluation - Specialized Ophthalmologic Examinations |year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071634205|url=http://accessmedicine.com/resourceTOC.aspx?resourceID=720|edition=18th}}</ref>  First, a dim light is presented at a particular location.  If the patient does not see the light, it is made gradually brighter until it is seen.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  The minimum brightness required for the detection of a light stimulus is called the "threshold" sensitivity level of that location.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  This procedure is then repeated at several other locations, until the entire visual field is tested.<ref name=VaughanGeneralOphth />  

Threshold static perimetry is generally done using automated equipment.  It is used for rapid screening and follow up of diseases involving deficits such as [[scotoma]]s, loss of [[peripheral vision]] and more subtle vision loss.  Perimetry testing is important in the screening, diagnosing, and monitoring of various [[human eye|eye]], [[retina]]l, [[optic nerve]] and [[human brain|brain]] disorders.

===Kinetic perimetry===
Kinetic perimetry uses a mobile stimulus moved by an examiner (perimetrist) such as in Goldmann kinetic perimetry.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Perimetry?|url=http://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/ips/Perimetr.htm|publisher=Imaging and Perimetry Society|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>  First, a single test light of constant size and brightness is used.  The test light is moved towards the center of vision from the periphery until it is first detected by the patient.  This repeated by approaching the center of vision from different directions.  Repeating this enough will establish a boundary of vision for that target.  The procedure is repeated using different test lights that are larger or brighter than the original test light.  

In this way, kinetic perimetry is useful for mapping visual field sensitivity boundaries.  It may be a good alternative for patients that have difficulty with automated perimetry, either due to difficulty maintaining constant gaze, or due to congnitive impairment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ing|first=Edsel|title=Neuro-Ophthalmic Examination|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1820707-overview#showall|work=Web MD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>
