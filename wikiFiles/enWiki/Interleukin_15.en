'''Interleukin 15''' (IL-15) is a [[cytokine]] with structural similarity to [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]].  Like [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]], IL-15 binds to and signals through a complex composed of IL-2/IL-15 receptor beta chain ([[IL-2 receptor|CD122]]) and the common gamma chain (gamma-C, [[IL2RG|CD132]]).  IL-15 is secreted by [[phagocytes|mononuclear phagocytes]] (and some other cells) following infection by [[virus]](es).  This cytokine induces [[cell proliferation]] of [[natural killer cell]]s; cells of the [[innate immune system]] whose principal role is to kill virally infected cells.

Interleukin - 15 (IL-15) was discovered in 1994 by two different laboratories, and characterized as [[T cell]] [[growth factor]].<ref name="Steel_2012"/> Together with [[interleukin 2]] ([[Interleukin 2|IL-2]]), [[interleukin 4]] ([[Interleukin-4|IL-4]]), [[interleukin 7]] ([[Interleukin 7|IL-7]]), [[interleukin 9]] ([[Interleukin 9|IL-9]]), [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] ([[G-CSF]]), and [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] ([[GM-CSF]]) belonging to the four α-helix bundle family of [[cytokine]].<ref name="Steel_2012"/><ref name="pmid21074481">{{cite journal | author = Di Sabatino A, Calarota SA, Vidali F, Macdonald TT, Corazza GR | title = Role of IL-15 in immune-mediated and infectious diseases | journal = Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–33 | year = 2011 | month = February | pmid = 21074481 | doi = 10.1016/j.cytogfr.2010.09.003 }}</ref>

[[File:Doc 6.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 3.'''  The main mechanism of IL-15 signaling is trans-presentation which is mediated by membrane-bound complex IL-15/IL-15Rα.

Due to sharing of receptor subunits between IL-2 and IL-15, both of these cytokines have similar downstream effects including the induction of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2), MAP (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase pathway and the phosphorylation of Lck (lymphocyte-activated protein tyrosine kinase) and Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) kinases, which leads to cell proliferation and maturation.]]

The prevailing mechanism of IL-15 action seems to be [[juxtacrine signaling]] or also determined as cell-to-cell contact. It also includes intracrine and reverse signaling. IL-15 was initially characterized as a soluble molecule. Later it was shown that IL-15 also exists as a membrane-bound form which represents the major form of IL-15 [[protein]]. In membrane-bound form it could be bound directly to [[cellular membrane]] or presented by [[IL-15 receptor|IL-15Rα receptor]].<ref name = "pmid21531164"/>

In [[mast cells]], the IL-15R [[signaling pathway]] has been found to include Jak2 and STAT5 instead Jak1/3 and STAT3/5. Phosphorylation STATs form transcription factors and activate transcription of appropriate genes. The β chain of IL-15R recruits and also activates protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family including Lck, Fyn and Lyn kinase. It also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT signaling pathway and induce expression of transcription factors including c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myc and NF-κB.<ref name="pmid21531164"/>

IL-15 is also able to bind to the 15Rβγc signaling complex with intermediate affinity without requirement for IL-15Rα rreceptor.

== Function ==

Interleukin 15 (IL-15) regulates [[T cell|T]] and [[natural killer cell|natural killer]] (NK) cell activation and proliferation.  Survival signals that maintain memory T cells in the absence of antigen are provided by IL-15.  This cytokine is also implicated in NK cell development.  In rodent lymphocytes, IL-15 prevents [[apoptosis]]  by inducing an apoptosis inhibitor, [[BCL2-like 1 (gene)|BCL2L1]]/BCL-x(L).<ref name = "entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: IL15 interleukin 15| url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3600}}</ref> In humans with [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]] IL-15 similarly suppresses apoptosis in T-lymphocytes by inducing [[Bcl-2]] and/or [[Bcl-xL]].<ref name="pmid20440074">{{cite journal | author = Malamut G, El Machhour R, Montcuquet N, Martin-Lannerée S, Dusanter-Fourt I, Verkarre V, Mention JJ, Rahmi G, Kiyono H, Butz EA, Brousse N, Cellier C, Cerf-Bensussan N, Meresse B | title = IL-15 triggers an antiapoptotic pathway in human intraepithelial lymphocytes that is a potential new target in celiac disease–associated inflammation and lymphomagenesis | journal = J.

A [[erythropoietin|hematopoietin]] receptor, the [[IL-15 receptor]], that binds IL-15 propagates its function.  Some subunits of the IL-15 receptor are shared in common with the receptor for a structurally related cytokine called [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2) allowing both cytokines to compete for and negatively regulate each other's activity.  [[CD8]]+ memory T cell number is controlled by a balance between IL-15 and IL-2.  When IL-15 binds its receptor, [[Janus kinase|JAK kinase]], [[STAT3]], [[STAT5]], and [[STAT6]] [[transcription factor]]s are activated to elicit downstream signaling events.
