The '''''stratum basale''''' (basal layer, sometimes referred to as '''''stratum germinativum''''') is the deepest layer of the five layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], which is the outer covering of skin in [[mammal]]s.

The ''stratum basale'' is a continuous layer of cells. It is often described as one cell thick, though it may in fact be two to three cells thick in glabrous (hairless) skin and hyperproliferative epidermis (from a skin disease).<ref name="Rooks">McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M. (2004). ''Rook's Textbook of Dermatology'' (Seventh Edition). Blackwell Publishing. Pages 3.7. ISBN 978-0-632-06429-8.</ref> 

The ''stratum basale'' is primarily made up of basal [[keratinocyte]] cells, which can be considered the [[stem cell]]s of the epidermis. They divide to form the keratinocytes of the ''[[stratum spinosum]]'', which migrate superficially.<ref name="Habif">{{cite book |title= Clinical Dermatology, 5th ed. |last= Habif |first= Thomas P. |year= 2010 |publisher= Mosby |isbn= 978-0-7234-3541-9 |page= 1}}</ref> Other types of cells found within the ''stratum basale'' are [[melanocyte]]s (pigment-producing cells), [[Langerhans cell]]s (immune cells), and [[Merkel cell]]s (touch receptors).
