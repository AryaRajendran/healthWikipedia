'''Zinc deficiency''' is insufficient [[zinc]] to meet the needs of biological organisms.  It can occur in both plants and animals. Zinc-deficient [[soil]] is soil in which there is insufficient zinc to allow plants to grow normally.

==Humans==

===Description===
'''Hypozincemia''' is a condition where insufficient zinc is available for [[metabolism|metabolic]] needs.

===Prevalence===
One-third of the world population is at risk of zinc deficiency. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  Countries vary from 4% to 73% in the rate at which their populations are exposed to this risk. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Zinc deficiency is the fifth leading risk factor for disease in the developing world. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Providing micronutrients, including zinc, to humans is one of the four quick-win solutions to major global problems identified in the [http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=953 Copenhagen Consensus] from an international panel of distinguished economists.

Conservative estimates suggest that 25% of the world's population is at risk of zinc deficiency.<ref name="pmid16632171">{{cite journal |author=Maret W, Sandstead HH |title=Zinc requirements and the risks and benefits of zinc supplementation |journal=J Trace Elem Med Biol |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=3–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16632171 |doi=10.1016/j.jtemb.2006.01.006}}</ref>

===Causes===
Hypozincemia is usually a nutritional deficiency, but can also be associated with [[malabsorption]], [[diarrhea]], [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[liver disease]], chronic [[renal disease]], [[sickle-cell disease]], [[diabetes]], [[malignancy]], pyroluria, and other chronic [[illness]]es.<ref>{{GPnotebook|886046736}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Prasad AS |title=Zinc deficiency : Has been known of for 40 years but ignored by global health organisations |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7386 |pages=409–10 |year=2003 |pmid=12595353 |pmc=1125304 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7386.409 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7386/409}}</ref> It can also occur after [[bariatric surgery]], heavy metal exposure<ref>El-Safty, Ibrahim A M, Gadallah, Mohsen, Shafik, Ahmed, Shouman, Ahmed E (2002) Effect of mercury vapour exposure on urinary excretion of calcium, zinc and copper: relationship to alterations in functional and structural integrity of the kidney ''Toxicol Ind Health'' '''18''' (8) 377-388 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15119526?dopt=Abstract]</ref><ref>Funk, Day, Brady (1987) Displacement of zinc and copper from copper-induced metallothionein by cadmium and by mercury: in vivo and ex vivo studies  ''Comp Biochem Physiol C'' '''86''' (1) 1-6 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2881702?dopt=Abstract]</ref> and tartrazine. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Zinc deficiency is typically the result of inadequate dietary intake of zinc, disease states that promote zinc losses, or physiological states that require increased zinc. Populations that consume primarily plant based diets that are low in bioavailable zinc often have zinc deficiencies.<ref>Solomons, N.W.

===Signs and symptoms===
Signs of zinc deficiency include [[diarrhea]], and wasting of body tissues{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. A lack of zinc can contribute to [[acne]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerd Michaelsson |title=Diet and Acne |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=104–106 |year=1981 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1981.tb06740.x |pmid=6451820}}</ref> Eyesight, taste,<ref name="pmid17592661">{{cite journal |author=Ikeda M, Ikui A, Komiyama A, Kobayashi D, Tanaka M |title=Causative factors of taste disorders in the elderly, and therapeutic effects of zinc |journal=J Laryngol Otol |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=155–60 |year=2008 |pmid=17592661 |doi=10.1017/S0022215107008833}}</ref><ref name="pmid17651517">{{cite journal |author=Stewart-Knox BJ |title=Taste acuity in response to zinc supplementation in older Europeans |journal=Br.

A deficiency in zinc can cause malfunctions of these organs and functions. Congenital abnormalities causing zinc deficiency may lead to a disease called [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]].

====Anorexia====
{{Main|Anorexia (symptom)}}

Zinc deficiency may cause a decrease in [[appetite]] which can degenerate into [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]]. {{cite pmid|21846317}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Appetite disorders, in turn, cause [[malnutrition]] and, notably, inadequate zinc intake. Anorexia itself is a cause of zinc deficiency, thus leading to a vicious cycle: the worsening of anorexia worsens the zinc deficiency. The use of zinc in the treatment of anorexia has been advocated since 1979 by Bakan. At least 15 trials showed that zinc improved weight gain in anorexia. A 1994 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that zinc (14&nbsp;mg per day) doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN).
Deficiency of other [[nutrients]] such as [[tyrosine]] and [[tryptophan]] (precursors of the [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]], respectively), as well as vitamin B<sub>1</sub> ([[thiamine]]) could contribute to this phenomenon of malnutrition-induced malnutrition.<ref name="Zincappetitereview">{{cite web|title=Neurobiology of Zinc-Influenced Eating Behavior |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/130/5/1493S|accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>

====Cognitive and motor function impairment====
Cognitive and motor function may also be impaired in zinc deficient children. Zinc deficiency can interfere with many organ systems especially when it occurs during a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high, such as during infancy.<ref>Sanstead, H. H. et al., (2000) Zinc nutriture as related to brain. J. Nutr. 130: 140S-146S</ref> In [[animal studies]], rats who were deprived of zinc during early fetal development exhibited increased emotionality, poor memory, and abnormal response to stress which interfered with performance in learning situations.<ref name="MM">{{cite journal |author=Black MM |title=The Evidence Linking Zinc Deficiency with Children's Cognitive and Motor Functioning, |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=133 |issue=5 Suppl 1 |pages=1473S–6S |year=2003 |pmid=12730446 |doi= |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12730446 |pmc=3137935}}</ref> Zinc deprivation in monkeys showed that zinc deficient animals were emotionally less mature, and also had cognitive deficits indicated by their difficulty in retaining previously learned problems and in learning new problems.<ref name="MM"/>  Human observational studies show weaker results.  Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning.<ref name="Black">{{cite journal |author=Black MM |title=Zinc deficiency and child development |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=68 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=464S–9S |year=1998 |pmid=9701161 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9701161 |pmc=3137936}}</ref>  In some studies, supplementation has been associated with motor development in very low [[birth weight]] infants and more vigorous and functional activity in infants and toddlers.<ref name="Black" /> 

Plasma zinc level has been associated with many psychological disorders. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear in most instances. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that zinc deficiency could play a causal role in the etiology of depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=J|coauthors=Oteiza|title=Zinc and the ERK kinases in the developing brain|journal=Neurotoxicity Research|year=2012|volume=21|pages=128–141|doi=10.1007/s12640-011-9291-6|pmid=22095091|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22095091}}</ref> Indeed zinc supplementation has been reported to improve measures of depression in randomized double blind placebo controlled trials.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20087376 | doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.158 | volume=64 | issue=3 | title=Effect of zinc supplementation on mood states in young women: a pilot study | year=2010 | month=March | author=Sawada T, Yokoi K | journal=Eur J Clin Nutr | pages=331–3}}</ref>

====Sexual Health of Men====
Zinc is required by men to produce testosterone. Thus, Zinc deficiency can lead to less testosterone production in men and hence show up with the symptoms associated with low testosterone.

====Diarrhea and pneumonia====
Zinc deficiency contributes to an increased incidence and severity of diarrhea and pneumonia.<ref>[http://www.eddcontrol.org/files/Role_zinc_child_health.pdf Penny M. Zinc Protects: The Role of Zinc in Child Health. 2004.]</ref> Studies have shown that zinc treatment results in a 25 percent reduction in duration of acute diarrhea and a 40 percent reduction in treatment failure or death in persistent diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhutta ZA |title=Therapeutic effects of oral zinc in acute and persistent diarrhea in children in developing countries: pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=1516–22 |year=2000 |pmid=11101480 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11101480 |author-separator=, |author2=Bird SM |author3=Black RE |display-authors=3 |last4=Brown |first4=KH |last5=Gardner |first5=JM |last6=Hidayat |first6=A |last7=Khatun |first7=F |last8=Martorell |first8=R |last9=Ninh |first9=NX}}</ref> The studies determined that a ten-day therapy of zinc treatment can considerably reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes, decrease stool output, and lessen the need for hospitalization. Zinc may also prevent future diarrhea episodes for up to three months. The current [[World Health Organization]] recommendation for diarrhea control includes the use of 20&nbsp;mg per day of zinc supplementation for 10 to 14 days (10&nbsp;mg per day for infants under the age of six months).<ref>[http://www.eddcontrol.org/files/Implementation_recommendations_WHO.pdf World Health Organization. Implementing the New Recommendations on the Clinical Management of Diarrhoea: Guidelines for Policy Makers and Programme Managers. 2006.]</ref> A zinc taste test may have potential for diagnosing deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garg HK, Singal KC, Arshad Z |title=Zinc taste test in pregnant women and its correlation with serum zinc level |journal=Indian J. Physiol. Pharmacol. |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=318–22 |year=1993 |month=October |pmid=8112809 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

====Hypotonic fluids can exacerbate some symptoms====
Zinc protects cells against hypotonicity. Drinking too much hypotonic fluid (long term, 4+ months) during zinc deficiency can cause shin lesions which are red, scaley, and hairless. These lesions will blister slightly after drinking hypotonic fluids and these same blisters will scab only after restoring osmolarity. Low sodium intakes have also been shown to directly reduce zinc retention
<ref name="pmid7185865">{{cite journal |title=The effect of sodium intake on zinc excretion in patients with sickle cell anemia |pmid=7185865 }}</ref>

====Dysmenorrhea====
High dose of zinc, 30&nbsp;mg 1-3 times a day, prevents [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name="pmid17289285">{{cite journal |author=Eby GA |title=Zinc treatment prevents dysmenorrhea |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=297–301 |year=2007 |pmid=17289285 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.12.009}}</ref>

====Pregnancy====
Zinc deficiency during pregnancy can negatively affect both the mother and fetus. Animal studies indicate that maternal zinc deficiency can upset both the sequencing and efficiency of the birth process. An increased incidence of difficult and prolonged labor, hemorrhage, uterine [[dystocia]] and placental abruption has been documented in zinc deficient animals.<ref name="shah">{{cite journal |author=Shah D, Sachdev HP |title=Zinc deficiency in pregnancy and fetal outcome |journal=Nutr. Rev. |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |year=2006 |pmid=16491666 |doi= 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2006.tb00169.x|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0029-6643&volume=64&issue=1&spage=15&aulast=Shah}}</ref> These effects may be mediated by the defective functioning of estrogen via the estrogen receptor, which contains a zinc finger protein.<ref name="shah"/> A review of pregnancy outcomes in women with acrodermatitis enteropathica, reported that out of every seven pregnancies, there was one abortion and two malfunctions, suggesting the human fetus is also susceptible to the teratogenic effects of severe zinc deficiency. However, a review on zinc supplementation trials during pregnancy did not report a significant effect of zinc supplementation on neonatal survival.<ref name="shah"/>

====Vitamins A and D====
Plasma zinc levels have been found to be dependent upon vitamins A and D. This suggests that a Vitamin A or D deficiency could cause a secondary zinc deficiency and that for treatment of zinc deficiency one should ensure adequate vitamin A and D intake.<ref name="pmid17171460">{{cite journal |author=Potocnik FC, van Rensburg SJ, Hon D, Emsley RA, Moodie IM, Erasmus RT |title=Oral zinc augmentation with vitamins A and D increases plasma zinc concentration: implications for burden of disease |journal=Metab Brain Dis. Pages=139-147 |year=2006 |pmid=17171460 |doi=10.1007/s11011-006-9023-4 |volume=21 |pages=139–47 |issue=2–3}}</ref>

====Hunger====
The influence of zinc on hunger is complex and likely depends upon the status of other nutrients, the developmental stage of the animal, and percentage body fat. Some research groups have argued for a role of zinc deficiency decreasing appetite,  while others have shown zinc ingestion can reduce feelings of hunger by increasing [[leptin]] levels.  There is evidence that the way zinc influences hunger depends on the [[sodium]]/[[osmotic]] status of the organism, with low sodium/low zinc levels increasing hunger and high sodium/low zinc levels decreasing it.  An organism with a low level of zinc has an increased susceptibility to [[hypoosmotic]] stress and cell rupture.  Thus if the osmotic pressure is too low the organism may be inclined to eat to raise [[osmolality]] and prevent [[osmotic shock]]. It should be noted that zinc is known to affect osmolality by increasing sodium retention.

In rats, the "first visible sign" of zinc deficiency is a decreased appetite.<ref>Shay NF, Mangian HF. (2000). [http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/130/5/1493S Neurobiology of Zinc-Influenced Eating Behavior].</ref>

====Cancer====
Zinc deficiency is also implicated in the pathogenesis of [[Esophagus|Esophageal]] [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] (ESCC) in many populations,<ref name=pmid15082451>{{cite journal|author=Kmet J, Mahboubi E.|title= Esophageal cancer in the Caspian littoral of Iran: initial studies|journal= Science|year= 1972|volume= 175|pages= 846–853|pmid=5008604}}</ref> including persons with chronic alcohol consumption.<ref name=pmid5008604>{{cite journal|author=Poschl G, Seitz HK|title= Alcohol and cancer|journal= Alcohol and alcoholism : international journal of the Medical Council on Alcoholism |year=2004|volume= 39|pages= 155–165|pmid=15082451}}</ref> Abnet et al.<ref name=pmid5008604>{{cite journal|author=Kmet J, Mahboubi E.|title= Esophageal cancer in the Caspian littoral of Iran: initial studies.|journal= Science|year= 1972|volume= 175| pages=846–853|pmid=5008604}}</ref> provided the strongest evidence of an association between dietary zinc deficiency and [[Esophagus|Esophageal]] [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] in a high-incidence area by establishing an inverse relationship between [[zinc]] concentration in biopsy samples and the subsequent risk of developing ESCC. In a rat model, chronic zinc deficiency induces an inflammatory gene signature that fuels [[Esophagus|Esophageal]] [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] development.<ref name=pmid22179833>{{cite journal|author=Taccioli C, Chen H, Jiang Y, Liu XP, Huang K, Smalley KJ, Farber JL, Croce CM, Fong LY|title=Dietary zinc deficiency fuels esophageal cancer development by inducing a distinct inflammatory signature|journal= Oncogene|year= 2012|volume=31|issue=42|pages= 4550–4558|pmid=22179833|doi= 10.1038/onc.2011.592}}</ref><ref name=pmid19111725>{{cite journal |author=Taccioli C, Wan SG, Liu CG, Alder H, Volinia S, Farber JL, Croce CM, Fong LY|title=Zinc replenishment reverses overexpression of the proinflammatory mediator S100A8 and esophageal preneoplasia in the rat|journal=Gastroenterology|year= 2009|volume=136|issue=3|pages=953–956|pmid=19111725|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.11.039}}</ref>

===Treatment===
Zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce diarrhea prevalence and mortality in children younger than 5 years of age.<ref name="pmid17582575">{{cite journal |author=Fischer Walker CL, Black RE |title=Micronutrients and diarrheal disease |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=45 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S73–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17582575 |doi=10.1086/518152}}</ref>

To combat zinc deficiency, five intervention strategies can be used:

*Supplementation using medicines
*Food fortification through the incorporation of zinc additives in food
*Dietary modification/diversification
*Agronomic biofortification through zinc fertilization.

These five intervention strategies may be used individually or in combination, depending on the setting, target group and degree of zinc deficiency.

The amount of zinc absorbed by the human body is a function of dietary intake of both zinc and [[phytic acid|phytate]] (a phosphate storage compound that [[chelation|chelates]] zinc), because the ratio between these two substances affects the bioavailability of zinc. Meeting the needs for absorbed zinc requires an increase in the zinc content and/or a decrease in the phytate content.

==Plants, crops, and soils==
Zinc is an essential micronutrient needed not only by people but also by crops. Almost half of the world’s cereal crops are deficient in zinc, leading to poor crop yields.<ref>Effect of zinc fertilization on rice plants and on the population of the rice-root nematodeHirschmanniella oryzae [http://www.springerlink.com/content/h247846304pr6122/ Journal of Pest Science]</ref>
Many agricultural countries around the world are affected by [http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/LIBRARY/Publications.html/Zinc-in-Soils-and-Crop-Nutrition.html zinc deficiencies].
In China, zinc deficiency occurs on around half of the agricultural soils, affecting mainly rice and maize.

In India, zinc-deficient soils occupy almost 50% of the agricultural area{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and are a critical constraint{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} on yield, but crops are highly responsive{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} to zinc fertilization.

In Turkey, major yield and quality benefits in wheat have been obtained with the widespread use of zinc fertilizers, where half of the cereal growing land is zinc-deficient.

Research has shown that areas with zinc-deficient soils are often regions with widespread zinc deficiency in humans.

A basic knowledge of the dynamics of Zn in soils, understanding of the uptake and transport of Zn in plant systems and characterizing the response of plants to Zn deficiency are essential steps in achieving sustainable solutions to the problem of Zn deficiency in plants and humans.<ref name= "IFIA"/>

===Fertilization===
Experiments show that soil and foliar application of zinc fertilizer can effectively increase grain zinc and reduce the phytate:zinc ratio in grain.<ref>[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11104-012-1217-4?LI=true Hussain et al. 2012.

Where zinc deficiency is a limiting factor, zinc fertilization can increase crop yields.<ref name="IFIA">{{ Cite web

Plant breeding, including modern biotechnology, can improve:

Zinc uptake capacity of plants under soil conditions with low chemical availability of zinc;
Zinc translocation, thus elevating zinc content in edible crop parts rather than the rest of the plant;
Zinc bioavailability.
For optimal efficiency, zinc-efficient genotypes should be associated with complementary soil crop management (including fertilization) to ensure adequate zinc uptake by roots and thus enhance zinc nutrition of crops and humans <ref>[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10681-011-0511-1?LI=true Hussain et al. 2012. Euphytica 186:153-163]</ref>

====Turkey====
Central Anatolia, in Turkey, was a region with zinc-deficient soils and widespread zinc deficiency in humans. In 1993, a research project found that yields could be increased by 6 to 8-fold and child nutrition dramatically increased through zinc fertilization.<ref>Enrichment of cereal grains with zinc: Agronomic or genetic biofortification? [http://www.springerlink.com/content/px14153568r06395/ Cakmak Ismail, in Plant and Soil, 2007]</ref>

Through a partnership with Cukurova University, the State and the private company TOROS Agri Industry Group, zinc was added to fertilizers. While the product was initially made available at the same cost, the results were so convincing that Turkish farmers significantly increased the use of the zinc-fortified fertilizer (1 per cent of zinc) within a few short years, despite the repricing of the products to reflect the added value of the content.

Today, nearly 10 years after the identification of the zinc deficiency problem, the total amount of zinc-containing compound fertilizers produced and applied in Turkey reached a record level of 300,000 tonnes per annum. It is estimated that the economic benefits associated with the application of Zn-fertilizers on Zn deficient soils in Turkey is around US$ 100 million per year. Zinc deficiency in children has been dramatically reduced.
