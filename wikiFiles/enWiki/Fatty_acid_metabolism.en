'''[[Fatty acid]]s''' are a family of molecules classified within the [[lipid]] [[macronutrient]] class. One of their roles within [[animal]] metabolism is energy production in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis. Fatty acids play other roles within biological system, as well. These roles include energy storage, phospholipid membrane formation, and signaling pathways. Thus one can see fatty acid metabolism consists of breakdown, [[catabolic]] processes that generate energy and [[primary metabolite]]s from fatty acids, and [[anabolic]] processes that create biologically important molecules from fatty acids and other dietary sources.

== Overview == 

*[[Lipolysis]] is carried out by [[lipases]].
*Once freed from [[glycerol]], free fatty acids can enter blood and muscle fiber by diffusion.
*[[Beta oxidation]] splits long carbon chains of the fatty acid into [[acetyl CoA]], which can eventually enter the [[Citric acid cycle|TCA cycle]].

Briefly, β-oxidation or lipolysis of free fatty acids is as follows:

#Dehydrogenation by [[acyl-CoA dehydrogenase]], yielding 1 [[FAD|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]
#Hydration by [[enoyl-CoA hydratase]]
#Dehydrogenation by [[3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase]], yielding 1 [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]]
#Cleavage by thiolase, yielding 1 [[acetyl-CoA]] and a fatty acid that has now been shortened by 2 carbons ([[acyl-CoA]])

This cycle repeats until the FFA has been completely reduced to [[acetyl-CoA]] or, in the case of fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms, [[acetyl-CoA]] and 1&nbsp;molecule of [[propionyl-CoA]] per mol of fatty acid.

==Fatty acids as an energy source==
Fatty acids, stored as triglycerides in an organism, are an important source of energy because they are both [[redox|reduced]] and [[anhydrous]]. The energy yield from a [[gram]] of fatty acids is approximately 9 [[calorie|Kcal]] (37 kJ), compared to 4 Kcal/g (17 kJ/g) for carbohydrates. Since the [[hydrocarbon]] portion of fatty acids is [[hydrophobic]], these [[molecule]]s can be stored in a relatively [[anhydrous]] (water-free) environment. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are more highly hydrated. For example, 1 g of [[glycogen]] can bind approximately 2 g of [[water]], which translates to 1.33 Kcal/g  (4 Kcal/3 g). This means that fatty acids can hold more than six times the amount of energy per unit of storage mass. Put another way, if the human body relied on carbohydrates to store energy, then a person would need to carry 67.5 [[pound (mass)|lb]] (31&nbsp;kg) of hydrated glycogen to have the energy equivalent  to 10&nbsp;lb (5&nbsp;kg) of [[fat]].
[[Hibernation|Hibernating]] animals provide a good example for utilizing fat reserves as fuel. For example, bears hibernate for about 7 months, and, during this entire period, the energy is derived from degradation of fat stores.

==Digestion and transport==
Fatty acids are usually ingested as [[triglyceride]]s, which cannot be absorbed by the [[intestine]]. They are broken down into free fatty acids and monoglycerides by [[pancreatic lipase]], which forms a 1:1 complex with a protein called [[colipase]], which is necessary for its activity. The activated complex can work only at a water-fat interface. Therefore, it is essential that fatty acids (FA) be emulsified by [[bile salt]]s for optimal activity of these enzymes.  

The digestion products of triglycerides are absorbed primarily as free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides, but a small fraction are absorbed as free glycerol and as diglycerides. Once across the intestinal barrier, they are reformed into triglycerides and packaged into [[chylomicron]]s or [[Lipoprotein|lipoproteins]], which are released into the [[lacteals]], the capillaries of the [[lymph system]] and then into the [[blood]]. Eventually, they bind to the membranes of [[hepatocyte]]s, [[adipocyte]]s or [[muscle fiber]]s, where they are either stored or oxidized for energy. The [[liver]] acts as a major organ for fatty acid treatment, processing chylomicron remnants and liposomes into the various [[lipoprotein]] forms, in particular [[Very-low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]] and  [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]. Fatty acids synthesized by the liver are converted to triglyceride and transported to the blood as [[Very-low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]]. In peripheral tissues, lipoprotein lipase digests part of the VLDL into LDL and free fatty acids, which are taken up for metabolism. This is done by the removal of the triglycerides contained in the VLDL. What is left of the VLDL absorbs cholesterol from other circulating lipoproteins, becoming LDLs. LDL is absorbed via [[LDL receptor]]s. This provides a mechanism for absorption of LDL into the cell, and for its conversion into free fatty acids, cholesterol, and other components of LDL. The liver controls the concentration of cholesterol in the blood by removing LDL. Another type of lipoprotein known as [[High-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein, or HDL]] collects cholesterol, glycerol and fatty acids from the blood and transports them to the liver. In summary: 
* Chylomicrons carry diet-derived lipids to body cells
* VLDLs carry lipids synthesized by the liver to body cells
* LDLs carry cholesterol around the body
* HDLs carry cholesterol from the body back to the liver for breakdown and excretion.

When blood sugar is low, decreasing [[insulin]] levels signal the adipocytes to activate [[hormone-sensitive lipase]], and to convert triglycerides into free fatty acids<ref>{{cite journal|last=STRÅLFORS|first=Peter|coauthors=HONNOR, Rupert C.|title=Insulin-induced dephosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|year=1989|volume=182|issue=2|page=379|pages=385|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14842.x|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14842.x}}</ref>. These have very low solubility in the blood, typically about 1 μM. However, the most abundant protein in blood, [[serum albumin]], binds free fatty acids, increasing their effective solubility to ~ 1 mM. Thus, [[serum albumin]] transports fatty acids to organs such as [[muscle]] and [[liver]] for oxidation when blood sugar is low.

==Transport and oxidation==
{{Main|Fatty acid degradation}}

The neutral lipids stored in [[adipocytes]] (and in steroid synthesizing cells of the adrenal cortex, ovary, and testes) in the form of [[lipid droplet|lipid droplets]], with a core of [[sterol]] esters and triacylglycerols surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids, are coated with [[perilipin]], a protein that acts as a protective coating from the body’s natural [[lipase]]s, such as [[hormone-sensitive lipase]],.<ref name="urlMaking Fat-proof Mice: Scientific American">{{cite web | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=making-fat-proof-mice | title = Making Fat-proof Mice  | author = Wong K | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2000-11-29 | format = | work = | publisher = Scientific American | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-05-22}}</ref> However, when hormones such as [[epinepherine]] are secreted, or when [[insulin]] levels drop in response to low blood glucose levels, this triggers an intracellular secondary messenger cascade that phosphorylates [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] to break [[triglyceride]]s into [[glycerol]] and free [[fatty acid]]s for use in [[metabolism]], a process called lipolysis.

The free fatty acids move into the blood stream where they are bound by [[serum albumin]] and transported to the tissue needing fuel. Once the fatty acids reach the target tissue, they are released by serum albumin and cross into the [[cytosol]]. The enzymes used in fatty acid oxidation in animal cells are located in the mitochondrial matrix (as was demonstrated by Eugene P. Kennedy and Albert Lehninger in 1948). Free fatty acid chains of more than 12 carbons require the help of membrane transporters to cross into the membrane into the mitochondria, where they undergo Fatty acid degradation.

Fatty acid degradation is the process in which [[fatty acids]] are broken down, resulting in release of energy. It includes three major steps: 

*Activation and transport into the [[mitochondria]]
*[[β-oxidation|β-Oxidation]]
*[[Electron transport chain]]

Fatty acids are transported across the [[outer mitochondrial membrane]] by [[carnitine-palmitoyl transferase I]] (CPT-I), and then couriered across the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]] by [[carnitine]].<ref>De Vivo, D. C. ''et al.'' (1998) ''L-Carnitine Supplementation in Childhood Epilepsy: Current Perspectives. ''Epilepsia''. Vol. 39(11), p.1216-1225. [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1998.tb01315.x]</ref> Once inside the [[mitochondrial matrix]], the fatty acyl-carnitine (such as [[palmitoylcarnitine]]) reacts with [[coenzyme A]] to release the fatty acid and produce [[acetyl-CoA]]. CPT-I is believed to be the [[rate-limiting step]] in fatty acid oxidation.

Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, fatty acids undergo [[β-oxidation]]. During this process, two-carbon molecules [[acetyl-CoA]] are repeatedly cleaved from the fatty acid. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the [[citric acid cycle]], which produces [[NADH]] and [[FADH2|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]. NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are subsequently used in the [[electron transport chain]] to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the energy currency of the cell.

Besides β-oxidation, other oxidative pathways are sometimes employed. [[alpha oxidation|α-Oxidation]] is used for branched fatty acids that cannot directly undergo β-oxidation. The smooth ER of the liver can perform [[omega oxidation|ω-oxidation]], which is primarily for detoxification but can become much more prevalent in cases of defective β-oxidation. Fatty acids with very long chains (20 or more carbons) are first broken down to a manageable size in [[peroxisome]]s.

==Regulation and control==

It has long been held that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the enzyme that hydrolyses triacylglycerides to free fatty acids from fats ([[lipolysis]]). However, more recently it has been shown that at most HSL converts triacylglycerides to monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Monoglycerides are hydrolyzed by monoglyceride lipase; adipose triglyceride lipase may have a special role in converting triacylglycerides to diacylglycerides, while diacylglycerides are the best substrate for HSL.<ref>Zechner R., Strauss J.G., Haemmerle G., Lass A., Zimmermann R. (2005) Lipolysis: pathway under construction. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 16, 333-340.</ref>  HSL is regulated by the hormones [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[epinephrine]].

Glucagon is associated with low blood glucose, and epinephrine is associated with increased metabolic demands.  In both situations, energy is needed, and the oxidation of fatty acids is increased to meet that need.  Glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine bind to [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s that activate [[adenylate cyclase]] to produce [[cyclic AMP]]. As a consequence, cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates (and activates) hormone-sensitive lipase. 
 
When blood glucose is high, lipolysis is inhibited by insulin.  Insulin activates [[Protein phosphatase|protein phosphatase 2A]], which dephosphorylates HSL, thereby inhibiting its activity.  Insulin also activates the enzyme [[phosphodiesterase]], which breaks down cAMP and stops the re-phosphorylation effects of protein kinase A.

For the regulation and control of metabolic reactions involving fat synthesis, see [[lipogenesis]].

==Disorders==
Disorders of fatty acid metabolism can be described in terms of, for example, [[hypertriglyceridemia]] (too high level of [[triglyceride]]s), or other types of [[hyperlipidemia]]. These may be familial or acquired.

Familial types of disorders of fatty acid metabolism are generally classified as [[inborn errors of lipid metabolism]]. These disorders may be described as [[fatty oxidation disorder]]s or as a ''[[lipid storage disorder]]s'', and are any one of several [[inborn errors of metabolism]] that result from enzyme defects affecting the ability of the body to [[oxidize]] [[fatty acid]]s in order to produce energy within muscles, liver, and other [[cell (biology)|cell]] types.
