'''Cyanide poisoning''' occurs when a living organism is exposed to a compound that produces [[cyanide]] ions (CN<sup>−</sup>) when dissolved in water.  Common poisonous cyanide compounds include [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas and the crystalline solids [[potassium cyanide]] and [[sodium cyanide]]. The cyanide ion halts cellular respiration by inhibiting an enzyme in the mitochondria called [[cytochrome c oxidase]].

==Acute poisoning==
Cyanide poisoning is a form of [[histotoxic hypoxia]] because the cells of an organism are unable to use oxygen, primarily through the inhibition of [[cytochrome c oxidase]]. If cyanide is inhaled it causes a coma with [[seizures]], [[apnea]], and cardiac arrest, with death following in a matter of minutes.  At lower doses, loss of consciousness may be preceded by general weakness, giddiness, headaches, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], confusion, and perceived difficulty in breathing. At the first stages of unconsciousness, breathing is often sufficient or even rapid, although the state of the victim progresses towards a deep coma, sometimes accompanied by [[pulmonary edema]], and finally cardiac arrest. Skin color goes blue from cyanide-hemoglobin complexes. A fatal dose for humans can be as low as 1.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/cyanide-cyanure/index-eng.php |title=Cyanide [Technical document – Chemical/Physical Parameters] |publisher=Health Canada}}</ref>

==Chronic exposure==
In addition to [[pesticide]] and [[insecticide]], cyanide is contained in tobacco smoke, smoke from building fires and some foods, like [[Almond#Sweet_and_bitter_almonds|almonds]], [[apricot kernel]], apple seeds, and [[cassava]] (also known as yuca or manioc). [[Vitamin B12]] in the form of hydroxycobalamin, or [[hydroxocobalamin]], may reduce the negative effects of chronic exposure, and a deficiency can lead to negative health effects following exposure.<ref name="National Library of Medicine">{{cite journal|pmid=494304|title=Effects of low cobalamin diet and chronic cyanide toxicity in baboons|publisher=National Library of Medicine | volume=12|issue=3|year=1979|author=Crampton RF, Gaunt IF, Harris R, ''et al.''|journal=Toxicology|pages=221–34|doi=10.1016/0300-483X(79)90068-4}}</ref>

Exposure to lower levels of cyanide over a long period (e.g., after use of [[cassava]] roots as a primary food source in tropical Africa) results in increased blood cyanide levels, which can result in weakness and a variety of symptoms, including permanent [[paralysis]], nervous lesions,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soto-Blanco B, Maiorka PC, Gorniak SL. |title=Effects of long-term low-dose cyanide administration to rats |journal=Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=37–41 |year=2002 |pmid=12481854 |doi=10.1006/eesa.2002.2189}}</ref><ref name="Soto-Blanco B, Stegelmeier BL, Pfister JA, et al. 2008 356–63">{{cite journal |author=Soto-Blanco B, Stegelmeier BL, Pfister JA, et al. |title=Comparative effects of prolonged administration of cyanide, thiocyanate and chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) to goats |journal=Journal of Applied Toxicology |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=356–63 |year=2008 |pmid=17631662 |doi=10.1002/jat.1286}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Soto-Blanco B, Maiorka PC, Gorniak SL. |title=Neuropathologic study of long term cyanide administration to goats |journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]] |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages= 1693–1698 |year=2002 |pmid=12176095 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00151-5}}</ref> hypothyroidism,<ref name="Soto-Blanco B, Stegelmeier BL, Pfister JA, et al. 2008 356–63"/> and miscarriages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soto-Blanco B, Gorniak SL. |title=Prenatal toxicity of cyanide in goats—a model for teratological studies in ruminants |journal=Theriogenology |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=1012–26 |year=2004 |pmid=15289044 |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2003.12.023}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Soto-Blanco B, Pereira, Verechia FT, et al. |title=Fetal and maternal lesions of cyanide dosing to pregnant goats |journal=Small Ruminant Research |volume=87 |issue=1–3 |pages=76–80 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.smallrumres.2009.09.029}}</ref> Other effects include mild liver and kidney damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sousa AB, Soto-Blanco B, Guerra JL, Kimura ET, Gorniak SL. |title=Does prolonged oral exposure to cyanide promote hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity? |journal=Toxicology |volume=174 |issue=2 |pages=87–95 |year=2002 |pmid=11985886 |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00041-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Manzano H, de Sousa AB, Soto-Blanco B, et al. |title=Effects of long-term cyanide ingestion by pigs |journal=Veterinary Research Communications |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=93–104 |year=2007 |pmid=17180454 |doi=10.1007/s11259-006-3361-x}}</ref>

==Treatment of poisoning and antidotes==
The United States standard cyanide [[antidote]] kit first uses a small inhaled dose of [[amyl nitrite]], followed by intravenous [[sodium nitrite]], followed by intravenous [[sodium thiosulfate]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|814287|Toxicity, Cyanide|overview}}</ref> [[Hydroxocobalamin]] is newly approved in the US and is available in Cyanokit antidote kits.<ref name=EmedTreat>{{EMedicine|article|814287|Toxicity, Cyanide|treatment}}</ref> [[Sulfanegen TEA]], which could be delivered to the body through an intra-muscular (IM) injection, detoxifies cyanide and converts the cyanide into thiocyanate; a less toxic substance.<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/antidote-cyanide-found-132827160.html{{full}}</ref> Alternative methods of treating cyanide intoxication are used in other countries.

! Agent
! Description
|-
| [[Nitrite]]s
| The nitrites oxidize some of the hemoglobin's iron from the [[ferrous]] state to the [[ferric]] state, converting the hemoglobin into [[methemoglobin]].
Cyanide binds avidly to methemoglobin, forming cyanmethemoglobin, thus releasing cyanide from cytochrome oxidase<ref name="emedicine.medscape.com">{{cite web |first=Inna |last=Leybell |title=Cyanide Toxicity |publisher=Medscape |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-overview}}</ref> Treatment with [[alkyl nitrite|nitrite]]s is not innocuous as methemoglobin cannot carry oxygen, and methemoglobinemia needs to be treated in turn with [[methylene blue]].
|-
| [[Thiosulfate]]
| The evidence for [[Sodium thiosulfate]]'s use is based on animal studies and case reports: the small quantities of cyanide present in dietary sources and in cigarette smoke are normally metabolized to relatively harmless thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme [[Rhodanese]] (thiosulfate cyanide sulfurtransferase), which uses thiosulfate as a substrate. However, this reaction occurs too slowly in the body for thiosulfate to be adequate by itself in acute cyanide poisoning. Thiosulfate must therefore be used in combination with nitrites.<ref name="emedicine.medscape.com"/>
|-cyanide can be found on a silver back lizard frog from the village called Bodelwyddan in the north of Wales.
| [[Hydroxocobalamin]]
|[[Hydroxocobalamin]], a form (or [[vitamer]]) of [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] made by bacteria, and sometimes denoted vitamin B<sub>12a</sub>, is used to bind cyanide to form the harmless [[cyanocobalamin]] form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] is newly approved in the US and is available in Cyanokit antidote kits. Cyanocobalamin is then eliminated through the urine.<ref name=EmedTreat/> Hydroxocobalamin works both within the intravascular space and within the cells to combat cyanide intoxication.  This versatility contrasts with methemoglobin, which acts only within the vascular space as an antidote.  Hydroxocobalamin is superior as a single agent to thiosulfate<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17098327 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=2007 |last1=Hall |first1=AH |last2=Dart |first2=R |last3=Bogdan |first3=G |title=Sodium thiosulfate or hydroxocobalamin for the empiric treatment of cyanide poisoning? |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=806–13 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.09.021 |journal=Annals of emergency medicine}}</ref> however, administration of sodium thiosulfate improves the ability of hydroxocobalamin to detoxify cyanide poisoning.  This treatment is considered so effective and innocuous that it is administered routinely in Paris to victims of smoke inhalation to detoxify any associated cyanide intoxication. However it is relatively expensive and not universally available.
|-
| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]]
| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]] (4-DMAP) has been proposed{{By whom|date=May 2010}} in Germany as a more rapid antidote than nitrites with (reportedly) lower toxicity.  4-DMAP is used currently by the German military and by the civilian population.  In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).
|-
| [[Dicobalt edetate]]
| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnoses of cyanide poisoning. Because of its side effects, it should be reserved only for patients with the most severe degree of exposure to cyanide: otherwise, nitrite/thiosulfate is preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=209160 |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |year=1978 |last1=Nagler |first1=J |last2=Provoost |first2=RA |last3=Parizel |first3=G |title=Hydrogen cyanide poisoning: Treatment with cobalt EDTA |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=414–6 |journal=Journal of occupational medicine}}</ref>
|-
| [[Glucose]]
| Evidence from animal experiments suggests that coadministration of [[glucose]] protects against cobalt toxicity associated with the antidote agent dicobalt edetate.  For this reason, glucose is often administered alongside this agent (e.g. in the formulation 'Kelocyanor').<BR>It has also been anecdotally suggested that glucose is itself an effective counteragent to cyanide, reacting with it to form less toxic compounds that can be eliminated by the body. One theory on the apparent immunity of [[Grigory Rasputin]] to cyanide was that his killers put the poison in sweet pastries and [[madeira wine]], both of which are rich in sugar; thus, Rasputin would have been administered the poison together with massive quantities of antidote. One study found a reduction in cyanide toxicity in mice when the cyanide was first mixed with glucose.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sertox.com.ar/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=120 |title=Valoración de la glucosa como antídoto en la intoxicación por cianuro |trans_title=Rating glucose as an antidote in cyanide poisoning |language=Spanish |first1=I |last1=Gerardo |first2=R |last2=Ilsen |first3=I |last3=Ernesto |first4=S |last4=Egar |first5=T |last5=Magaly |first6=G |last6=Marcelo |author-name-separator= |author-separator=, |journal=Retel |issue=7 |year=2005}}</ref> However, as yet glucose on its own is not an officially acknowledged antidote to cyanide poisoning.
|-
| 3-Mercaptopyruvate prodrugs
| The most widely studied cyanide-metabolizing pathway involves utilization of thiosulfate by the enzyme [[rhodanese]], as stated above. In humans, however, Rhodanese, is concentrated in the kidneys (0.96 Units/mg protein) and liver (0.15 u/mg), with concentrations in lung, brain, muscle and stomach not exceeding 0.03 U/ml.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00580-006-0647-x |title=Cyanide-metabolizing enzyme rhodanese in human tissues: Comparison with domestic animals |year=2006 |last1=Aminlari |first1=Mahmoud |last2=Malekhusseini |first2=Ali |last3=Akrami |first3=Fatemeh |last4=Ebrahimnejad |first4=Hadi |journal=Comparative Clinical Pathology |volume=16 |pages=47–51}}</ref> In all these tissues, it is found in the mitochondrial matrix, a site of low accessibility for ionized, inorganic species, such as thiosulfate.  This compartmentalizatiion of Rhodanese in mammalian tissues leaves major targets of cyanide lethality, namely, the heart and central nervous system unprotected. (Rhodanese is also found in red blood cells, but its relative importance has not been clarified.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baskin SI, Horowitz AM, Nealley EW |title=The antidotal action of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate against cyanide poisoning |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=368–75 |year=1992 |month=April |pmid=1569239 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1992.tb03849.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alexander K, Procell LR, Kirby SD, Baskin SI |title=The inactivation of rhodanese by nitrite and inhibition by other anions in vitro |journal=J.

A different cyanide-metabolizing pathway. 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3-MPST, EC 2.8.1.2), which is more widely distributed in mammalian tissues than Rhodanese, is being explored. 3-MPST converts cyanide to thiocyanate, using the cysteine catabolite, 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP).  However, 3-MP is extremely unstable chemically. Therefore, a [[prodrug]], sulfagene sodium (2, 5-dihydroxy-1,4-[[dithiane]]-2,5-dicarboxylic acid disodium salt), which hydrolyzes into 2 molecules of 3-MP after being administered orally or parenterally, is being evaluated in animal models.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crankshaw DL, Goon DJ, Briggs JE, ''et al.'' |title=A novel paradigm for assessing efficacies of potential antidotes against neurotoxins in mice |journal=Toxicol.

|-
| [[Oxygen therapy]]
| [[Oxygen therapy]] is not a cure in its own right. However, the [[human liver]] is capable of [[metabolizing]] cyanide quickly in low doses (smokers breathe in hydrogen cyanide, but it is such a small amount and metabolized so fast that it does not [[Accumulation|accumulate]]). 

The [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] issued a survey (IPCS/CEC Evaluation of Antidotes Series) that lists the following antidotal agents and their effects: oxygen, sodium thiosulfate, amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, 4-dimethylaminophenol, hydroxocobalamin, and dicobalt edetate ('Kelocyanor'), as well as several others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/antidote/antidote/ant02.htm#PartNumber:6 |title=Antidotes for Poisoning by Cyanide: 6. AMYL NITRITE |work=IPCS/CEC Evaluation of Antidotes Series; Volume 2}}</ref> Other commonly-recommended antidotes are 'solutions A and B' (a solution of [[ferrous sulfate]] in aqueous [[citric acid]], and aqueous [[sodium carbonate]]) and [[amyl nitrite]].

The UK [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) has recommended against the use of solutions A and B because of their limited shelf life, potential to cause iron poisoning, and limited applicability (effective only in cases of cyanide ingestion, whereas the main modes of poisoning are inhalation and skin contact).  The HSE has also questioned the usefulness of amyl nitrite due to storage/availability problems, risk of abuse, and lack of evidence of significant benefits.  It also states that the availability of Kelocyanor at the workplace may mislead doctors into treating a patient for cyanide poisoning when this is an erroneous diagnosis.  The HSE no longer recommends a particular cyanide antidote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc076.htm |title=Cyanide poisoning – New recommendations on first aid treatment |publisher=Health and Safety Executive}}</ref> Qualified UK [[first aid]]ers are now only permitted to apply [[oxygen therapy]] using a [[bag valve mask]], providing they have been trained in its usage.

==Historical cases==
===Burnings===
* On January 27, 2013, a fire at the [[Kiss nightclub fire|Kiss nightclub]] in the city of [[Santa_Maria,_Rio_Grande_do_Sul|Santa Maria]], in the south of [[Brazil]], caused the poisoning of hundreds of young people by cyanide released by the combustion of soundproofing foam made with [[polyurethane]].

===Gas chambers===
* [[Hydrogen cyanide]] gas was the agent used by [[Nazi Germany]] for mass murder in some [[gas chamber]]s during [[the Holocaust]]. It was released from [[Zyklon B]] pellets, which were a commercial [[biocide]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/#iii |title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz: III.

* Hydrogen cyanide gas has also been used for [[judicial execution]] in some states of the United States, where cyanide was generated by reaction between [[potassium cyanide]] dropped into a compartment containing [[sulfuric acid]], directly below the chair in the [[Gas chamber#United States|gas chamber]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://civilliberty.about.com/od/capitalpunishment/ig/Types-of-Executions/Gas-Chamber-Executions.htm |title=Gas Chamber Executions |publisher=About.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=The Holocaust FAQ|title=Nazi Deathcamps| url=http://www.auschwitz.dk/bullseye/new_page_4.htm|accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref>  The State of California so executed [[Caryl Chessman]].

===War===
Cyanides were stockpiled in [[chemical weapon]]s arsenals in both the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  However, as a military agent, hydrogen cyanide was not considered very effective, since it is lighter than air and needs a significant dose to incapacitate or kill.

Although there have been no verified instances of its use as a weapon, hydrogen cyanide may have been employed by [[Iraq]] in the [[Halabja poison gas attack]] against the [[Kurd]]s in the 1980s under [[Saddam Hussein]].  This information has not been verified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp |title=Facts About Cyanide |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>

===Suicide===
Cyanide salts are sometimes used as fast-acting suicide devices. Since cyanide works better with higher stomach [[acidity]], it should, in theory, work best with an empty stomach.

* During the Gunnerside Operation to destroy the Vemork Heavy Water Plant in World War II (an attempt to stop/slow German atomic bomb progress), the Gunnerside men were given cyanide tablets (cyanide enclosed in rubber) kept in the mouth and were instructed to bite into them in case of German capture.  The tablets ensured death within three minutes.  For detailed information on Operation Gunnerside, read the chapter "''Operation Gunnerside''" in the award-winning book ''Bomb: the Race to Build--and Steal--the World's Most Dangerous Weapon''.

* On July 19, 2012, Urooj Khan, 46, cashed in an Illinois lottery ticket for more than $600,000. After taxes, the winnings amounted to about $425,000. Khan fell ill the next day and was pronounced dead at a hospital. No autopsy was done because, at the time, the Chicago Medical Examiner's Office didn't generally perform them on people 45 and older unless the death was suspicious. The cutoff age has since been raised to 50. After the basic toxicology screening for opiates, cocaine and carbon monoxide came back negative, the death was ruled a result of the narrowing and hardening of coronary arteries. Days after the initial cause of death was released, a relative of Khan's asked authorities to look into the case further. The morgue reopened the case and did more expansive toxicology studies. On March 1, 2013, the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] coroner's office  confirmed Khan was the victim of cyanide poisoning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cook County Medical Examiner Confirms $1 Million Lottery Winner Was Poisoned With Cyanide|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/cook-county-medical-examiner-confirms-ill-lottery-winner/story?id=18629454|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>
