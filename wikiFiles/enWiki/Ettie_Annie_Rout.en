'''Ettie Annie Rout''' (24 February 1877 – 17 September 1936) was a [[Tasmania]]n-born [[New Zealanders|New Zealander]] whose work among servicemen in Paris and the [[Somme]] during [[World War I]] made her a war hero among the [[French people|French]], yet through the same events she became ''[[persona non grata]]'' in New Zealand. She married Fred Hornibrook on 3 May 1920, after which she was '''Ettie Hornibrook'''. They had no children and later separated, and she died, and is buried in the [[Cook Islands]].

==Life==
Born in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania, Australia, she was raised in [[Wellington]], New Zealand from 1884. After leaving school, she became a [[shorthand]] typist for commissions of inquiry and the then [[New Zealand#Judiciary|Supreme Court]] (now the High Court, and not to be confused with the present [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]]). Biographers believe this job gave her a wide range of experiences on social issues. She was later a [[journalism|reporter]], businessperson, and writer, but most importantly, she was a campaigner on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].

Ettie Rout's experiences founding a volunteer nursing group during [[World War I]], the New Zealand Volunteer Sisterhood,  made her aware of the prevalence of [[sexually transmitted infections|STI]] among servicemen. By 1917, the [[New Zealand Army]] had made free distribution of her safe sex kit compulsory. It was for work in [[Paris]], inspecting brothels and recommending them to arriving servicemen, and in the [[Somme]], that she was decorated by the French. In 1917 she and several other New Zealand nurses were [[Mentioned in Despatches]] by [[Archibald Murray|General Sir Archibald Murray]]<ref name=""> {{cite web

Ironically, in New Zealand, her exploits were considered such that her name, on pain of a [[New Zealand dollar|£]]100 fine, could not be published. However though, her activities could be published.

Similar ironies were found overseas; her 1922 book, ''Safe Marriage: A Return to Sanity'', was banned in New Zealand, but published in both [[Australia]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. In the latter, it was a best-seller. However, in the [[House of Lords]], a [[bishop]] called her 'the wickedest woman in Britain.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/65866 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Rout, Ettie Annie]</ref><ref>No such quote can be found in http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/search/</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Rout died as the result of a [[quinine]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]] in [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]] following her sole postwar return to New Zealand in 1936. She is interred at an [[Avarua]] church cemetery. In 1992, Jane Tolerton wrote her biography, and more recently, she has been more critically perceived as a "White Australasia" apologist in Phillippa Levine's account of [[contagious disease]] legislation within the late nineteenth century British Empire.<ref>Phillippa Levine (2003), ''Prostitution, Race and Politics: Policing Venereal Disease in the British Empire:'', New York, Routledge, ISBN 0-415-94447-3</ref><ref>Jane Tolerton (1992), ''Ettie: A Life of Ettie Rout'', Auckland, Penguin, ISBN 0-14-017216-5</ref>

In 1983 an episode of the New Zealand television series ''Pioneer Women'' dramatised her story.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pioneer Women - Ettie Rout|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/pioneer-women-ettie-rout-1983|work=Pioneer Women|publisher=TVNZ via NZ On Screen|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref>
