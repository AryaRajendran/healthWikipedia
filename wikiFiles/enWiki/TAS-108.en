'''TAS-108''', also known as '''SR16234''', is a drug discovered by [[Masato Tanabe]] and under development by [[SRI International]] and [[Taiho Pharmaceutical]]. It is a [[steroid hormone]] that has showed signs of treating and preventing [[breast cancer]], even in patients where [[tamoxifen]] has failed.<ref name="pmid14680815">{{cite journal | author = Yamamoto Y, Wada O, Takada I, Yogiashi Y, Shibata J, Yanagisawa J, Kitazato K, Kato S | title = Both N- and C-terminal transactivation functions of DNA-bound ERalpha are blocked by a novel synthetic estrogen ligand | journal = Biochem.

==Development==
Masato Tanabe's team at SRI has focused on the development of steroid hormones. A compound discovered in a previous SRI contract from the [[National Institute of Health]] showed potential - it acted like "anti-estrogen" in the breasts and uterus but like normal estrogen elsewhere in the body, and was more "tissue-selective".<ref name="nielson">{{cite book | last = Nielson | first = Donald | title = A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century | publisher = SRI International | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-9745208-1-0 | location = [[Menlo Park, California]] | pages=10-13 - 10-15}}</ref> A contract was proposed to [[Taiho Pharmaceutical]] in July 1996, and within six years and slightly under $3 million (an unusually short amount of time) two new drugs were discovered and tested on people (particularly people for which [[tamoxifen]] has failed): SR16234 and SR16287.<ref name="nielson"/> 

The first of those, SR16234, also inhibited the growth of blood vessels [[angiogenesis]] and accellerated the death of cancer cells [[apoptosis]] and thus was particularly well suited to be an anti-cancer drug.<ref name="nielson"/> As of August 2010, the drug had been through five Phase I and two Phase II studies,<ref>{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.sri.com/newsroom/press-releases/sri-international-advance-clinical-development-tas-108-late-stage-breast-can|title=SRI International to Advance Clinical Development of TAS-108, a Late-Stage Breast Cancer Drug|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/engage/products-solutions/TAS-108|title=TAS-108: A Better Anti-Estrogen Drug for Treating Breast Cancer|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref> and Phase III studies are being planned.<ref name="pmid15701885">{{cite journal | author = Buzdar AU | title = TAS-108: a novel steroidal antiestrogen | journal = Clin.
