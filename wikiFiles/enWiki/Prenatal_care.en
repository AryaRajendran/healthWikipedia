'''Prenatal care''' (also known as antenatal care) refers to the regular medical and nursing care recommended for women during [[pregnancy]].<ref name="Prenatal Care (nlm.nih.gov)" /><ref name="Prenatal Care (MedicineNet)" /><ref name="Prenatal Care (womenshealth.gov))" /> Prenatal care is a type of [[preventative care]] with the goal of providing regular check-ups that allow doctors or midwives to treat and prevent potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy while promoting healthy lifestyles that benefit both mother and child.<ref name="womenshealth">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/prenatal-care.cfm. Retrieved on 11 March 2012</ref><ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/prenatal+care. Retrieved on 11 March 2012.</ref> During check-ups, women will receive medical information over [[maternal physiological changes in pregnancy]], biological changes, and [[prenatal nutrition]] including [[prenatal vitamins]]. Recommendations on management and healthy lifestyle changes are also made during regular check-ups. The availability of routine prenatal care has played a part in reducing [[maternal death]] rates and [[miscarriage]]s as well as [[birth defects]], [[low birth weight]], and other preventable health problems. 

Prenatal care generally consists of:
* monthly visits during the first two [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimesters]] (from week 1–28)
* fortnightly from 28 to week 36 of pregnancy
* weekly after week 36 (delivery at week 38–40)
* Assessment of parental needs and family dynamic

==Prenatal Examinations==
{{main|Prenatal diagnosis| prenatal screening}} 

Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that "Prenatal Diagnosis" and "Prenatal Screening" refer to two different types of tests) is [[Experiment|testing]] for diseases or conditions in a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] before it is born. [[Obstetricians]] and [[midwives]] have the ability to monitor mother's health and [[prenatal development]] during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups.<ref name="womenshealth"/> 

Physical examinations generally consist of:
* Collection of (mother's) [[medical history]]
* Checking (mother's) [[blood pressure]]
* (Mother's) height and weight
* [[Pelvic exam]]
* [[Doppler fetal heart rate monitor]]ing
* (Mother's) [[blood test|blood]] and [[urine test]]s
* Discussion with caregiver

Ultrasound
[[Obstetric ultrasonography|Obstetric ultrasound]]s are most commonly performed during the second trimester at approximately week 20. Ultrasounds are considered relatively safe and have been used for over 35 years for monitoring pregnancy.
Among other things, ultrasounds are used to:
* Diagnose pregnancy (uncommon)
* Check for multiple fetuses
* Assess possible risks to the mother (e.g., [[miscarriage]], [[blighted ovum]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], or a [[molar pregnancy]] condition)
* Check for fetal malformation (e.g., [[club foot]], [[spina bifida]], [[cleft palate]], clenched fists)
* Determine if an [[intrauterine growth retardation]] condition exists
* Note the development of fetal body parts (e.g., [[heart]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[stomach]], [[human skull|skull]], other [[bone]]s)
* Check the [[amniotic fluid]] and [[umbilical cord]] for possible problems
* Determine due date (based on measurements and relative developmental progress)

Generally an ultrasound is ordered whenever an abnormality is suspected or along a schedule similar to the following:
* 7 weeks — confirm pregnancy, ensure that it's neither molar or ectopic, determine due date
* 13–14 weeks (some areas) — evaluate the possibility of [[Down Syndrome]]
* 18–20 weeks — see the expanded list above
* 34 weeks (some areas) — evaluate size, verify placental position

==In the United States==
{{main|Prenatal care in the United States}}

Proper prenatal care affects all women of various social background. While availability of such services have considerable personal health and social benefits, socioeconomic problems prevent its universal adoption in both developing and developed nations, such as the US. Although women can benefit by utilizing prenatal care services, there exists various levels of health care accessibility between different demographics throughout the United States.
