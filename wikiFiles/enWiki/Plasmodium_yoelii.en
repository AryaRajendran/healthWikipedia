'''''Plasmodium yoelii''''' is a parasite of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' subgenus ''[[Vinckeia]]''. 

Like all ''Plasmodium'' species ''P. yoelii'' has both [[vertebrate]] and [[insect]] hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are [[mammal]]s.

== Description ==

This species was described in 1968 by Landau, Michel and Adam.

== Geographical occurrence ==

This species occurs in [[Africa]].

==Vectors==

The natural vectors of this species are not currently known.

== Clinical features and host pathology ==

This species infects ''[[Thamnonys rutilans]]''

== Notes ==

Three subspecies are recognised: ''P. yoelii killicki'', ''P. yoelii nigeriensis'' and ''P. yoelii yoelli''. 

Its most notable feature is that it is used in the laboratory to infect [[mice]], as a model of human [[malaria]], particularly with respect to the [[immune system|immune response]].

It is advantageous to have a whole-[[animal model]] of malaria because often it is difficult to know which factors to study ''in vitro'', particularly in a complex system like the [[immune system]].  Moreover, for many experiments it is not ethical or practical to use humans.

One of the special things about this particular model is that it has two strains with vastly different pathogenicity.  These are generally referred to as the "lethal" and "non-lethal" strains of the species. Comparison of these two strains can be used to deduce which factors may contribute to more serious malaria infections in humans.
