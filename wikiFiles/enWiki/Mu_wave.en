'''Mu waves''', also known as '''mu rhythms''', comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or [[sensorimotor rhythm]]s, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal]] type, in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement.<ref name=Amzica /> These patterns as measured by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), or [[electrocorticography]] (ECoG) repeat at a frequency of 8–13 [[Hz]] and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest.<ref name=Amzica>{{cite book|title=Niedermeyer's Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-8942-4|pages=33–63|author=Amzica, Florin|edition=6th|coauthors=Fernando Lopes da Silva|editor=Schomer, Donald L.; Fernando Lopes da Silva|chapter=Celluluar Substrates of Brain Rhythms}}</ref> Unlike the [[alpha wave]], which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting [[visual cortex]] at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the [[motor cortex]], in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [[wikt:desynchronization|desynchronization]] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action. Researchers such as [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|V. S.

==History==

Mu waves have been studied since the 1930s, and are referred to as the wicket rhythm because the rounded EEG waves resemble [[Croquet|croquet wickets]]. In 1950, [[Henri Gastaut]] and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects, but also while the subjects observed actions executed by someone else.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/> These results were later confirmed by additional research groups,<ref name=r3/><ref name=r4/><ref name=r5/> including a study using [[wikt:subdural|subdural]] [[electrode]] grids in [[epileptic]] patients.<ref name=r6/>  The latter study showed mu suppression while the patients observed moving body parts in [[somatic]] areas of the cortex that corresponded to the body part moved by the actor. Further studies have shown that the mu waves can also be desynchronized by imagining actions<ref name=r7/><ref name=r8/> and by passively viewing point-light [[biological motion]].<ref name=r9/>

==Mu waves and mirror neurons==

The [[mirror neuron system]] consists of a class of [[neuron]]s that was first studied in the 1990s in [[macaque monkey]]s.<ref name=Williams>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Justin H.G.|coauthors=Waiter, Gordon D.; Gilchrist, Anne; Perrett, David I.; Murray, Alison D.; Whiten, Andrew|title=Neural mechanisms of imitation and 'mirror neuron' functioning in autistic spectrum disorder|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1 January 2006|volume=44|issue=4|pages=610–621|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.010|pmid=16140346|url=http://culture.st-and.ac.uk/whiten/docs/NeuralMechanisms.pdf}}</ref>  Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks.<ref name="di Pellegrino">{{cite journal|last=di Pellegrino|first=G.|coauthors=Fadiga, L.; Fogassi, L.; Gallese, F.; Rizzolatti, G.|title=Understanding motor events: A neurophysiological study|journal=Experimental Brain Research|year=1992|volume=91|issue=1|pages=176–180|pmid=1301372}}</ref> This suggests they play a role in mapping others' movements into the brain without actually physically performing the movements. These sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up the mirror neuron system. Mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire, a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans.<ref name=Rizzolatti>{{cite journal|last=Rizzolatti|first=G|coauthors=Fogassi, L; Gallese, V|title=Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and imitation of action|journal=Nature reviews.

===Mirror neurons and autism===

[[Autism]] is a disorder that is associated with social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself.<ref name=Oberman>{{cite journal|last=Oberman|first=L. M.|coauthors=Pineda, J. A.; Ramachandran, V. S.|title=The human mirror neuron system: A link between action observation and social skills|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=18|year=2006|volume=2|issue=1|pages=62–66|doi=10.1093/scan/nsl022|pmc=2555434|pmid=18985120}}</ref><ref name="Bernier"/> This finding has led some scientists, notably [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|V. S. Ramachandran]] and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' [[intention]]s and [[goal]]s thanks to problems with the mirror neuron system.<ref name=Williams /> This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching [[Cognitive deficit|cognitive]] and [[Social skills|social]] deficits.<ref name=Oberman /><ref name=Bernier />

==Development==
A fruitful conceptualization of mu waves in pediatric use that is independent of their frequency is that mu wave suppression is a representation of activity going on in the world, and is detectable in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] networks.<ref name=Pineda3 /> A resting oscillation becomes suppressed during the observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights, usually within the [[wikt:frontoparietal|frontoparietal]] (motor) cortical region.<ref name=Pineda3 /> Measured in this way, the mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months, when the peak frequency the wave reaches can be as low as 5.4 [[Hz]].<ref name=Nystrom /><ref name=Berchicci /> There is a rapid increase in peak frequency in the first year of life,<ref name=Berchicci>{{cite journal|last=Berchicci|first=M.|coauthors=Zhang, T.; Romero, L.; Peters, A.; Annett, R.; Teuscher, U.; Bertollo, M.; Okada, Y.; Stephen, J.; Comani, S.|title=Development of Mu Rhythm in Infants and Preschool Children|journal=Developmental Neuroscience|date=21 July 2011|volume=33|issue=2|pages=130–143|doi=10.1159/000329095|pmid=21778699|pmc=3221274}}</ref> and by age two frequency typically reaches 7.5&nbsp;Hz.<ref name=Marshall /> The peak frequency of the mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood, when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8–13&nbsp;Hz.<ref name=Nystrom /><ref name=Marshall /><ref name=Berchicci /> These varying frequencies are measured as activity around the [[central sulcus]], within the Rolandic cortex.<ref name=Pineda3>{{cite journal|last=Pineda|first=Jaime A.|title=The functional significance of mu rhythms: Translating "seeing" and "hearing" into "doing"|journal=Brain Research Reviews|date=1 December 2005|volume=50|issue=1|pages=57–68|doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.04.005|pmid=15925412}}</ref>

Mu waves are thought to be indicative of an infant’s developing ability to [[imitate]]. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital role in the development of [[motor skill]]s, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction.<ref name=Marshall /> Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues.<ref name=Nystrom /> Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults.<ref name=Nystrom /> This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life.<ref name=Berchicci /> Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for [[language development]]. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.<ref name=Meltzoff>{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=A.

===Development in individuals with autism===

Based on findings correlating mirror neuron activity and mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals,<ref name=Pineda2>{{cite journal|last=Pineda|first=J.A.|coauthors=Juavinett, A.; Datko, M.|title=Self-regulation of brain oscillations as a treatment for aberrant brain connections in children with autism|journal=Medical Hypotheses|date=1|year=2012|volume=79|issue=6|pages=790–798|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2012.08.031|pmid=22999736}}</ref> studies have examined both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that [[fMRI]] activation magnitudes in the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better [[social functioning]].<ref name=Bastiaansen>{{cite journal|last=Bastiaansen|first=JA|coauthors=Thioux, M; Nanetti, L; van der Gaag, C; Ketelaars, C; Minderaa, R; Keysers, C|title=Age-related increase in inferior frontal gyrus activity and social functioning in autism spectrum disorder|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1|year=2011|volume=69|issue=9|pages=832–838|pmid=21310395|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.11.007}}</ref> Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus is one of the main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism.<ref name=Keuken>{{cite journal|last=Keuken|first=M.

This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain.<ref name=Pineda3 /> Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using [[neurofeedback]] (a type of [[biofeedback]] given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.<ref name=Holtmann>{{cite journal|last=Holtmann|first=Martin|coauthors=Steiner, Sabina; Hohmann, Sarah; Poustka, Luise; Banaschewski, Tobias; Bölte, Sven|title=Neurofeedback in autism spectrum disorders|journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology|date=1|year=2011|volume=53|issue=11|pages=986–993|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2011.04043.x|pmid=21752020}}</ref><ref name=Coben>{{cite journal|last=Coben|first=Robert|coauthors=Linden, Michael; Myers, Thomas E.|title=Neurofeedback for Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Review of the Literature|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|date=24|year=2009|volume=35|issue=1|pages=83–105|doi=10.1007/s10484-009-9117-y|pmid=19856096}}</ref>

==Brain-computer interfaces==

[[Brain-computer interface]]s (BCIs) are a developing technology that clinicians hope will one day bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology has the potential to help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with [[tetraplegia]] (quadriplegia) or advanced [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, [[neuroprostheses]], or robotic grasping tools.<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Machado>{{cite journal|last=Machado|first=S|coauthors=Araújo, F; Paes, F; Velasques, B; Cunha, M; Budde, H; Basile, LF; Anghinah, R; Arias-Carrión, O; Cagy, M; Piedade, R; de Graaf, TA; Sack, AT; Ribeiro, P|title=EEG-based brain-computer interfaces: an overview of basic concepts and clinical applications in neurorehabilitation|journal=Reviews in the neurosciences|year=2010|volume=21|issue=6|pages=451–68|pmid=21438193|doi=10.1515/REVNEURO.2010.21.6.451}}</ref> Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level.<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Pfurtscheller2>{{cite book|title=Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195388855|pages=227–240|author=Pfurtscheller, Gert|coauthors=McFarland, Dennis J.|editor=Wolpaw, Jonathan R.; Wolpaw, Elizabeth Winter|chapter=BCIs that use sensorimotor rhythms}}</ref><ref name=Leuthardt>{{cite journal|last=Leuthardt|first=Eric C.|coauthors=Schalk, Gerwin; Roland, Jarod; Rouse, Adam; Moran, Daniel W.|title=Evolution of brain-computer interfaces: going beyond classic motor physiology|journal=Neurosurgical Focus|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=E4|doi=10.3171/2009.4.FOCUS0979|pmc=2920041|pmid=19569892}}</ref> One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer.<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /> This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the [[cortical homunculus]] and thus distinguishable by an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] (EEG) or [[electrocorticograph]] (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the [[motor cortex]].<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Pfurtscheller2 /> In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD [[contralateral]] to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue.<ref name=Pfurtscheller2 /> This paired pattern intensifies with training,<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Pfurtscheller2 /><ref name=Leuthardt /><ref name=Allison>{{cite journal|last=Allison|first=B Z|coauthors=Leeb, R; Brunner, C; Müller-Putz, G R; Bauernfeind, G; Kelly, J W; Neuper, C|title=Toward smarter BCIs: extending BCIs through hybridization and intelligent control|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|date=1|year=2012|volume=9|issue=1|pages=013001|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/9/1/013001|pmid=22156029}}</ref> and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize [[virtual reality]].<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Pfurtscheller2 /><ref name=Allison /> Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns.<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Allison /> The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.<ref name=Pfurtscheller1 /><ref name=Pfurtscheller2 />
