The low concentration of homeopathic remedies, which often lack even a single [[molecule]] of the diluted substance,<ref name="Ernst2005"/> has been the basis of questions about the effects of the remedies since the 19th century. Modern advocates of homeopathy have suggested that "[[water memory|water has a memory]]"{{spaced ndash}}that during mixing and succussion, the substance leaves an enduring effect on the water, perhaps a "vibration", and this produces an effect on the patient.

Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into German. Being skeptical of Cullen's theory concerning [[cinchona]]'s use for curing [[malaria]], Hahnemann ingested some of the bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and [[arthralgia|joint pain]]: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat, in accord with the "law of similars" that had been proposed by ancient physicians.<ref name="UllmanReichenberg-Ullman1994">{{cite book|author1=Robert W.

====Proving====
Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure that would later become known as "homeopathic proving". These tests required subjects to test the effects of ingesting substances by clearly recording all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.<ref name="Haehl1922">{{cite book|author=Richard Haehl|title=Samuel Hahnemann: His Life and Work : Based on Recently Discovered State Papers, Documents, Letters, Etc|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q80gR6OxDVsC&pg=PA101|accessdate=24 January 2013|year=1922|publisher=B.

Since Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects.<ref name="Dynamization and Dilution" /> Hahnemann believed that this process aroused and enhanced "the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances".<ref name="Organon_5th_269">

In  ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', Hahnemann introduced the concept of "miasms" as "infectious principles" underlying chronic disease.<ref name="ClarkeClarke2001">{{cite book|author1=J. H.

Hahnemann originally presented only three miasms, of which the most important was ''psora'' (Greek for "itch"), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed [[scabies]], and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. 
Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].<ref name="Hahnemann_Chronic">

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements by [[George Vithoulkas]] claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system. 
This conflicts with scientific studies, which indicated [[penicillin]] treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="Birnbaum">{{citation

Campbell described this as "a thoroughly irresponsible statement that could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing orthodox treatment".

The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as [[genetics]], environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.<ref name=Shelton>{{citation |author=Shelton, Jay W. |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it Really Works |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4}}</ref>{{rp|148-9|date=November 2012}}

===19th century: rise to popularity and early criticism===
Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. Dr. [[John Franklin Gray]] (1804&ndash;1882) was the first practitioner of homeopathy in the United States, beginning in 1828 in [[New York City]].  The first homeopathic schools opened in 1830, and throughout the 19th century dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States.<ref name=Julian>

From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science.

In the United States the ''Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act'' of 1938 (sponsored by [[Royal S.

In the 1950s, there were only 75 pure homeopaths practicing in the U.S.<ref>

==Remedies and treatment==
{{see also|List of homeopathic preparations}}
[[File:Rhustox.jpg|thumb|Homeopathic remedy ''Rhus toxicodendron'', derived from [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]].]]

Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies: ''[[materia medica]]'' and repertories. A homeopathic ''materia medica'' is a collection of "drug pictures", organised alphabetically by "remedy," that describes the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. A homeopathic repertory is an index of disease symptoms that lists remedies associated with specific symptoms.<ref name=elixris><!-- replace this by something less commercial! -->

Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. 
Examples include ''[[arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster snake]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]). 
Homeopaths also use treatments called "nosodes" (from the Greek ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.<ref name="pmid16322800"/> Homeopathic remedies prepared from healthy specimens are called "sarcodes".

Some modern homeopaths have considered more esoteric bases for remedies, known as "imponderables" because they do not originate from a substance, but from [[electromagnetic energy]] presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or [[lactose]].<!--See next two sources, and the rest of the journal issue they came from for more information--> Examples include [[X-ray]]s<ref>

Today, about 3,000 different remedies are commonly used in homeopathy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
Some homeopaths also use techniques that are regarded by other practitioners as controversial. 
These include "paper remedies", where the substance and dilution are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, as well as the use of [[radionics]] to prepare remedies. 
Such practices have been strongly criticised by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.<ref>

===Preparation===
[[File:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|[[Mortar and pestle]] used for grinding insoluble solids, including quartz and oyster shells, into homeopathic remedies]]

In producing remedies for diseases, homeopaths use a process called "dynamisation" or "potentisation", whereby a substance is diluted with alcohol or [[distilled water]] and then vigorously shaken by 10 hard strikes against an elastic body in a process homeopaths call "succussion".<ref>{{citation

}}</ref> Hahnemann advocated using substances that produce symptoms like those of the disease being treated, but found that undiluted doses intensified the symptoms and exacerbated the condition, sometimes causing dangerous toxic reactions.

===Dilutions===
{{Main|Homeopathic dilutions}}

Three [[logarithm]]ic potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the "centesimal" or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. 
A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in 100, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of 100. 
This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.<ref>
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.</ref> A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100<sup>−6</sup>=10<sup>−12</sup> (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. 
In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies.<ref>

Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a "pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans",<ref name=Bambridge/><ref name=Andrews/> which is approximately correct.<ref>
A 12C solution produced using [[sodium chloride]] (also called ''natrum muriaticum'' in homeopathy) is the equivalent of dissolving 0.36&nbsp;mL of table salt, weighing about 0.77&nbsp;g, into a volume of water the size of the Atlantic Ocean, since the volume of the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas is 3.55×10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> or 3.55×10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;L :

Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally used lower dilutions such as "3X" or "6X", rarely going beyond "12X". 
The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines.  
Those favoring low dilutions stressed [[pathology]] and a strong link to conventional medicine, while those favoring high dilutions  emphasised vital force, miasms and a [[spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of disease.<ref>

At first Hahnemann used undiluted doses for provings, but he later advocated provings with remedies at a 30C dilution,<ref name = "Organon_6th_128"/> and most modern provings are carried out using ultradilute remedies in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain.<ref>

The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. 
They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation. 
After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings have been described as important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.<ref>

For [[James Tyler Kent]]'s 1905 ''Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica'', 217 remedies underwent provings and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.

Though the proving process has superficial similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different in that the process is subjective, not blinded, and modern provings are unlikely to use pharmacologically active levels of the substance under proving.<ref name=Creighton>[http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/science/validity.htm Are the principles of Homeopathy scientifically valid?], Creighton University School of Medicine</ref> As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not repeatable among different subjects.<ref name=Holmes />

From these symptoms, the homeopath chooses how to treat the patient. A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings, supplemented with clinical data, is known as a "homeopathic ''materia medica''". 
But because a practitioner first needs to explore the remedies for a particular symptom rather than looking up the symptoms for a particular remedy, the "homeopathic repertory", which is an index of symptoms, lists after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it. 
Repertories are often very extensive and may include data extracted from multiple sources of ''materia medica''. 
There is often lively debate among compilers of repertories and practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion.

The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic ''materia medica'' was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students, [[Clemens Maria Franz von Bönninghausen|Clemens von Bönninghausen]], created the ''Therapeutic Pocket Book'', another homeopathic repertory.<ref>

The first such homeopathic repertory was Georg Jahr's ''Symptomenkodex'', published in German (1835), which was then first translated to English (1838) by Constantine Hering as the ''Repertory to the more Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica''.

It consisted of three large volumes. Such repertories increased in size and detail as time progressed.

Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. "Classical homeopathy" generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms, while "clinical homeopathy" involves combinations of remedies to address the various symptoms of an illness.<ref name=pmid12614092/>

===Homeopathic pills===
[[File:DoseOscillococcinum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Homeopathic pills, homeopathic remedy ''[[oscillococcinum]]'']]

==="Active" ingredients===
The list of ingredients seen on remedies may confuse consumers into believing the product actually contains those ingredients. According to normal homeopathic practice, remedies are prepared starting with [[active ingredient]]s that are often serially diluted to the point where the finished product no longer contains any biologically "active ingredients" as that term is normally defined. 

[[James Randi]] and the [[10:23 campaign]] groups have demonstrated the lack of active ingredients in homeopathic products by taking large overdoses.<ref name=Jones/> None of the hundreds of demonstrators in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US were injured and "no one was cured of anything, either".<ref name=Coghlan>{{cite web |author=Coghlan A|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18455-mass-drug-overdose--none-dead.html |title=Mass drug overdose – none dead |date=1 February 2010|publisher= New Scientist |work= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>

While the lack of active compounds is noted in most homeopathic products, there are some exceptions such as [[Zicam|Zicam Cold Remedy]], which is marketed as an "unapproved homeopathic" product.<ref name=label_data>[http://www.labeldataplus.com/detail.php?c=16034 Label data]</ref> It contains a number of highly diluted ingredients that are listed as "inactive ingredients" on the label.  Some of the homeopathic ingredients used in the preparation of Zicam are galphimia glauca,<ref>{{Citation |last1=Teut |first1=Michael |last2=Dahler |first2=JÖrn |last3=Schnegg |first3=Christoph |title=A Homoeopathic Proving of Galphimia glauca |journal=Forschende Komplementärmedizin / Research in Complementary Medicine |volume=15 |pages=211–7 |year=2008 |doi=10.1159/000148825 |issue=4}}</ref> histamine dihydrochloride (homeopathic name, ''histaminum hydrochloricum''),<ref>[http://www.remedysource.com/store/remedy_detail.php?remedy_id=690 Description of Histaminum Hydrochloricum]</ref> [[luffa operculata]],<ref>[http://www.bioforceusa.com/pflant-encyclopaedia/luffa_operculata.php Luffa operculata L. COGN Sponge Cucumber]</ref> and [[sulfur]]. 
Although the product is marked "homeopathic", it does contain two ingredients that are only "slightly" diluted: [[zinc acetate]] (2X = 1/100 dilution) and [[zinc gluconate]] (1X = 1/10 dilution),<ref name=label_data/> which means both are present in a concentration that contains biologically active ingredients. In fact, they are strong enough to have caused some people to lose their sense of smell,<ref name=NYT1>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/health/policy/17nasal.html?hp | title=FDA Warns Against Use of Zicam | publisher=New York Times | author=Harris, Gardinier | date=June 16, 2009 }}</ref> a condition termed [[anosmia]]. This illustrates why taking a product marked "homeopathic", especially an [[drug overdose|overdose]],<ref name=Jones>Sam Jones, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/29/sceptics-homeopathy-mass-overdose-boots "Homeopathy protesters to take 'mass overdose' outside Boots"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 January 2010></ref> can still be dangerous because it may contain biologically active ingredients, though as discussed previously, most homeopathic preparations contain no active ingredients. Because the manufacturers of Zicam label it as a homeopathic product (despite the relatively high concentrations of active ingredients), it is exempted from FDA regulation by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).

====Isopathy====
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s. Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies, known as "nosodes", are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]] or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]].<ref name="pmid16322800"/><ref>{{citation

====Flower remedies====
Flower remedies can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the physician and homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. Although the proponents of these remedies share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the remedies are claimed to act through the same hypothetical "vital force" as homeopathy, the method of preparation is different. Bach flower remedies are prepared in "gentler" ways such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and the remedies are not succussed.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Vanhaselen |first1=R |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: A critical appraisal |journal=British Homoeopathic journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052 |doi=10.1054/homp.1999.0308}}</ref> There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower remedies being effective.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title="Flower remedies": a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift |volume=114 |issue=23–24 |pages=963–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12635462}}</ref>

====Veterinary use====
The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals, termed "veterinary homeopathy", dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.<ref name=Saxton2007>{{Citation |last1=Saxton |first1=J |title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17227741 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010}}</ref> The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the U.S. In the UK, [[veterinary surgeon]]s who use homeopathy belong to the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]] and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons. Animals may be treated only by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy. The use of homeopathy in veterinary medicine is controversial; the little existing research on the subject is not of a high enough scientific standard to provide reliable data on efficacy.<ref name=Hektoen>{{Citation |last1=Hektoen |first1=L |title=Review of the current involvement of homeopathy in veterinary practice and research |journal=[[Veterinary Record]] |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=224–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16113167}}</ref> Other studies have also found that giving animals placebos can play active roles in influencing pet owners to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.<ref name=Hektoen/>

[[Electrohomeopathy]] was a 19th century practice combining homeopathy with electric treatment.

===Plausibility===
The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations often leave none of the original substance in the final product. The modern mechanism proposed by homeopaths, [[water memory]], is considered implausible in that short-range order in water only persists for about 1 [[picosecond]].<ref name=Teixeira>{{Citation |last1=Teixeira |first1=J |title=Can water possibly have a memory?

====High dilutions====
The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy preclude a biologically plausible mechanism of action. Homeopathic remedies are often diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.<ref name=Milgrom>{{Citation |last1=Milgrom |first1=L |title=Conspicuous by its absence: the Memory of Water, macro-entanglement, and the possibility of homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=209–19 |year=2007 |pmid=17678819 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.002}}</ref> Homeopaths contend that the methodical dilution of a substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active remedy, in contrast to therapeutically inert water.

Furthermore, since water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, critics point out that water is therefore an extreme dilution of almost any conceivable substance. By drinking water one would, according to this interpretation, receive treatment for every imaginable condition.<ref>

===Efficacy===
[[File:Hepar.jpg|thumb|Old bottle of ''Hepar sulph'' made from [[calcium sulfide]]]]

The effectiveness of homeopathy has been in dispute since its inception. One of the earliest double blind studies concerning homeopathy was sponsored by the British government during World War II in which volunteers tested the efficacy of homeopathic remedies against diluted mustard gas burns.<ref name="Mustard">{{Citation|publisher=James Lind Library|year=2003|author=Dean, M.E.|title=The homeopathic mustard gas trials of 1941–42|url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/illustrating/articles/the-homeopathic-mustard-gas-trials-of-1941-42}}</ref>

====Publication bias and other methodological issues====
{{Further|Statistical hypothesis testing|P-value|Publication bias}}
The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contradiction with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false-positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a [[statistical significance|"statistically significant"]] positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%—a level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect.<ref name="Sterne2001">{{Citation |last1=Sterne |first1=J.

<blockquote>The evidence of bias [in the primary studies] weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most "original" subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results.

In 2002, a systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic remedy exerts clinical effects different from placebo.<ref name="pmid12492603" />

In 2005, ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]]'s [[Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine]], or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are nothing more than placebo effects.<ref name="shang" />

A 2006 meta-analysis of six trials evaluating homeopathic treatments to reduce [[Oncology|cancer therapy]] side-effects following [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] found that there was "insufficient evidence to support clinical efficacy of homeopathic therapy in cancer care".<ref name="pmid16376071">{{Citation |last1=Milazzo |first1=S |last2=Russell |first2=N |last3=Ernst |first3=E |title=Efficacy of homeopathic therapy in cancer treatment |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=282–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16376071 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.09.025}}</ref>

A 2007 systematic review of homeopathy for children and adolescents found that the evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhea was mixed. No difference from placebo was found for adenoid vegetation, asthma, or upper respiratory tract infection. Evidence was not sufficient to recommend any therapeutic or preventative intervention, and the delay in medical treatment may be harmful to the patient.<ref name=pmid17285788 />

In 2012, a systematic review evaluating evidence of homeopathy's possible [[adverse effect]]s concluded that "homeopathy has the potential to harm patients and consumers in both direct and indirect ways".<ref name="sr2012">{{cite doi|10.1111/ijcp.12026}}</ref> One of the reviewers, [[Edzard Ernst]], supplemented the article on his blog, writing: "I have said it often and I say it again: if used as an alternative to an effective cure, even the most 'harmless' treatment can become life-threatening."<ref>{{cite web

Clinical studies of the medical efficacy of homeopathy have been criticised by some homeopaths as being irrelevant because they do not test "classical homeopathy".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4183916.stm |title=Homoeopathy's benefit questioned  |periodical =[[BBC News]]  |date=2005-08-26 |accessdate =2009-01-09 }}</ref>  There have, however, been a number of clinical trials that have tested individualized homeopathy. A 1998 review<ref>{{Citation |last1=Linde |first1=Klaus |last2=Melchart |first2=Dieter |title=Randomized Controlled Trials of Individualized Homeopathy: A State-of-the-Art Review |journal=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=371–88 |year=1998 |pmid=9884175 |doi=10.1089/acm.1998.4.371}}</ref> found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favor of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded "that the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies." Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations.<ref name=Shelton/>{{rp|209|date=November 2012}}

In a 2012 article published in the [[Skeptical Inquirer]],<ref name=EdzardE>{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Edzard|title=Homeopathy: A Critique of Current Clinical Research|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=36|issue=November/December|pages=39–42|year=2012|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]}}</ref> Edzard Ernst reviewed the publications of the research group that has published most of the clinical studies of homeopathic treatment from 2005 to 2010.  A total of 11 articles, published in both conventional and alternative medical journals, describe three randomized clinical trials (one article), prospective cohort studies without controls (seven articles) and comparative cohort studies with controls (three articles).  The diseases include a wide range of conditions from knee surgery, eczema, migraine, insomnia to "any condition of elderly patients".  Ernst's evaluation found numerous flaws in the design, conduct and reporting of the clinical studies. Examples include: little detail of the actual homeopathic treatment administered, misleading presentation of controls (comparison of homeopathic plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment, but presented as homeopathic versus conventional treatment); and similar data in multiple articles.  He concluded that the misinterpreted weak data made the homeopathy appear to have clinical effects which can be attributed to bias or confounding, and that the "casual reader can be seriously misled".<ref name=EdzardE/>

===Explanations of perceived effects===
Science offers a variety of explanations for how homeopathy may appear to cure diseases or alleviate symptoms even though the remedies themselves are inert:<ref name=Shelton/>{{rp|155-167|date=November 2012}}
* The [[placebo effect]] — the intensive consultation process and expectations for the homeopathic preparations may cause the effect
* Therapeutic effect of the consultation — the care, concern, and reassurance a patient experiences when opening up to a compassionate caregiver can have a positive effect on the patient's well-being
* Unassisted [[natural healing]] — time and the body's ability to heal without assistance can eliminate many diseases of their own accord
* Unrecognized treatments — an unrelated food, exercise, environmental agent, or treatment for a different ailment, may have occurred
* [[Regression toward the mean]] — since many diseases or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary over time and patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; they may feel better anyway but because the timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the remedy taken
* Non-homeopathic treatment — patients may also receive standard medical care at the same time as homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement
* Cessation of unpleasant treatment — often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient.

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]], a type of [[white blood cell]], released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were "statistically ill-controlled", "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported."<ref name="delusion">

Referring specifically to homeopathy, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:
{{quote|
In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice - which the Government claims is very important - as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.<ref name=inquiry_cfm/>}}

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] of the United States' [[National Institutes of Health]] states:

{{quote|
Homeopathy is a controversial topic in complementary medicine research. A number of the key concepts of homeopathy are not consistent with fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics. For example, it is not possible to explain in scientific terms how a remedy containing little or no active ingredient can have any effect. This, in turn, creates major challenges to rigorous clinical investigation of homeopathic remedies. For example, one cannot confirm that an extremely dilute remedy contains what is listed on the label, or develop objective measures that show effects of extremely dilute remedies in the human body.<ref name="nih-homeo">{{cite web

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements made by [[George Vithoulkas]] to promote his homeopathic treatments. Vithoulkas stated that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]]. Campbell described this as a thoroughly irresponsible statement that could mislead an unfortunate layperson into refusing conventional medical treatment. This claim echoes the idea that treating a disease with external medication used to treat the symptoms would only drive it deeper into the body and conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="Birnbaum"/>

A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine.<ref>

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries.<ref name=WHO /> Regulations vary in Europe depending on the country. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training program, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.<ref name=WHO/> Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and [[Luxembourg]]. In other countries, such as Belgium, homeopathy is not covered. In Austria, the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and homeopathy is listed as not reimbursable,<ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]], MPs inquired into homeopathy to assess the Government's policy on the issue, including funding of homeopathy under the [[National Health Service]] and government policy for licensing homeopathic products. The decision by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee follows a written explanation from the Government in which it told the select committee that the licensing regime was not formulated on the basis of scientific evidence. "The three elements of the licensing regime (for homeopathic products) probably lie outside the scope of the ... select committee inquiry, because government consideration of scientific evidence was not the basis for their establishment," the Committee said. The inquiry sought written evidence and submissions from concerned parties.<ref name=THE29thOct2009>{{Citation|publisher=Times Higher Education|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408852&c=1|title=News in brief: Homeopathic assessment|date=29 October 2009}}, timeshighereducation.co.uk</ref><ref name=091020_cfm>[http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_technology/s_t_pn05_091020.cfm Evidence check: Homeopathy], House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, 20 October 2009, parliament.uk</ref>

In February 2010 the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee concluded that:
{{quote|
... the NHS should cease funding homeopathy. It also concludes that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ([[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]]) should not allow homeopathic product labels to make medical claims without evidence of efficacy. As they are not medicines, homeopathic products should no longer be licensed by the MHRA.

The Committee concurred with the Government that the evidence base shows that homeopathy is not efficacious (that is, it does not work beyond the placebo effect) and that explanations for why homeopathy would work are scientifically implausible.

The Committee concluded – given that the existing scientific literature showed no good evidence of efficacy – that further clinical trials of homeopathy could not be justified.

In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice – which the Government claims is very important – as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.<ref name=inquiry_cfm/>}}

The Committee also stated:

In July 2010 the newly appointed UK [[Secretary of State for Health]] deferred to local NHS on funding homeopathy.

[[CBC News]] reporter [[Erica Johnson]] for ''Marketplace'' conducted an investigation on the homeopathy industry in Canada, her findings were that it is "based on flawed science and some loopy thinking". [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) Vancouver skeptics participated in a mass overdose outside an emergency room in Vancouver, B.C., taking entire bottles of "medications" that should have made them sleepy, nauseous or dead, after 45 minutes of observation no ill effects were felt. Johnson asked homeopaths and company representatives about cures for cancer and vaccine claims, all reported positive results.  None could offer any science backing up their statements, only that "it works". Johnson was unable to find any evidence that homeopathic preparations contain any active ingredient. [[University of Toronto]]'s chemistry department found that the active ingredient is so small "it is equivalent to 5 billion times less than the amount of aspirin... in a single pellet".  Belladonna and ipeca "would be indistinguishable from each other in a blind test."<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Erica|title=CBC Marketplace - Homeopathy: Cure or Con?
