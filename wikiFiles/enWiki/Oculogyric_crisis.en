'''Oculogyric crisis (OGC)''' is the name of a [[dystonia|dystonic]] reaction to certain drugs or medical conditions. The term "oculogyric" refers to rotating of [[human eyeball|eyeball]]s,<ref>{{eMedicineDictionary|oculogyric}}</ref> but several other responses are associated with the crisis.
[[Epilepsy]] can manifest as '''oculogyric seizures''', also called versive seizures.<ref>Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia:Second Edition

==Causes==
Drugs that can trigger an oculogyric crisis include [[neuroleptic]]s (such as [[olanzapine]]),<ref name="pmid19910730">{{cite journal |author=Praharaj SK, Jana AK, Sarkar S, Sinha VK |title=Olanzapine-induced tardive oculogyric crisis |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=604–6 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19910730 |doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e3181c00b08 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0271-0749&volume=29&issue=6&spage=604}}</ref> [[carbamazepine]], [[cetirizine]],<ref name="pmid14962433">{{cite journal |last=Fraunfelder |first=Frederick W. |coauthors=Fraunfelder, Frederick T. |title=Oculogyric crisis in patients taking cetirizine |journal=Am J Ophthalmol |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14962433 |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=355–357 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9394(03)00869-9 |url=http://www.ajo.com/article/S0002-9394%2803%2900869-9/abstract|accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref> [[chloroquine]], [[cisplatin]], [[diazoxide]], [[levodopa]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[lithium carbonate|lithium]], [[metoclopramide]], [[domperidone]], [[nifedipine]], [[pemoline]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  [[phencyclidine|phencyclidine ("PCP")]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[reserpine]]. 

Other causes can include [[Parkinson's Disease|postencephalitic Parkinson's]], [[Tourette syndrome|Tourette's syndrome]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[neurosyphilis]], head trauma, [[bilateral thalamic infarction]], lesions of the [[fourth ventricle]], [[cystic glioma]] of the [[third ventricle]], [[herpes]] [[encephalitis]], kernicterus and [[Parkinson's Disease|juvenile Parkinson's]].

==Symptoms and signs==
Initial symptoms include restlessness, agitation, malaise, or a fixed stare.  Then comes the more characteristically described extreme and sustained upward deviation of the eyes.  In addition, the eyes may converge, deviate upward and laterally, or deviate downward.  The most frequently reported associated findings are backwards and lateral flexion of the neck, widely opened mouth, tongue protrusion, and ocular pain.  However it may also be associated with intensely painful jaw spasm which may result in the breaking of a tooth.  A wave of exhaustion may follow an episode.  The abrupt termination of the psychiatric symptoms at the conclusion of the crisis is most striking.

Other features that are noted during attacks include [[mutism]], [[palilalia]], eye blinking, [[lacrimation]], [[pupil]] dilation, drooling, respiratory [[dyskinesia]],  increased blood pressure and heart rate, facial flushing, headache, vertigo, anxiety, agitation, compulsive thinking, paranoia, depression, recurrent fixed ideas, depersonalization, violence, and obscene language.

It is often not realized that in addition to the acute presentation, OGC can develop as a recurrent syndrome, triggered by stress, and exposure to the above drugs.

==Treatment==
Immediate treatment of drug induced OGC can be achieved with [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[antimuscarinic]] [[benzatropine]] or [[procyclidine]]; which usually are effective within 5 minutes, although may take as long as 30 minutes for full effect. Further doses of procyclidine may be needed after 20 minutes. Any causative new medication should be discontinued. Also can be treated with 25&nbsp;mg [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl).
