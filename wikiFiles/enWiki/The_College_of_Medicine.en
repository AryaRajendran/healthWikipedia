In support of this connection with Prince Charles, [[alternative medicine]] critic and pharmacologist [[David Colquhoun]] has argued that the College (originally called "The College of Integrated Health") is extremely well-funded<ref name=Buckinghamgate>{{cite web | url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263 | title=Buckinghamgate: the new "College of Medicine" arising from the ashes of the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health | date=July 25, 2010 | author=David Colquhoun | publisher=DC's Improbable Science}}</ref> and seemed from the beginning to be very confident of the Prince's support, explicitly describing its mission as "to take forward the vision of HRH the Prince of Wales" in an early presentation.<ref name=Delusion>{{cite news|url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632|title=Don’t be deceived.
