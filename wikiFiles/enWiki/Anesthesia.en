'''Anesthesia''', or '''anaesthesia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αν-}}, ''an-'', "without"; and {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις}}, ''aisthēsis'', "sensation"),<ref name=Merriam>{{cite dictionary|title=Anesthesia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anesthesia|accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> traditionally meant the condition of having [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] (including the feeling of [[pain]]) blocked or temporarily taken away. It is a [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] induced and reversible state of [[amnesia]], [[Analgesic|analgesia]], loss of responsiveness, loss of [[skeletal muscle]] [[reflexes]], decreased [[Fight-or-flight response|stress response]], or all of these simultaneously. These effects can be obtained from a single drug which alone provides the correct combination of effects, or occasionally a combination of drugs (such as [[hypnotics]], [[sedatives]], [[paralytic]]s and [[analgesics]]) to achieve very specific combinations of results. This allows patients to undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. An alternative definition is a "reversible lack of awareness," including a total lack of [[awareness]] (e.g. a general anesthetic) or a lack of awareness of a part of the body such as a spinal anesthetic. The pre-existing word ''anesthesia'' was suggested by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] in 1846 as a word to use to describe this state.<ref name=Perkins2005>{{cite web|last=Perkins|first=W|title=How does anesthesia work?|work=Scientific American: Ask the Experts|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group|Nature America, Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=2005-02-07|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-does-anesthesia-work|accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref>

Types of anesthesia include [[local anesthesia]], [[regional anaesthesia|regional anesthesia]], [[general anaesthesia|general anesthesia]], and [[Dissociative|dissociative anesthesia]]. Local anesthesia inhibits [[Sensory receptor|sensory perception]] within a specific location on the body, such as a tooth or the urinary bladder. Regional anesthesia renders a larger area of the body insensate by blocking transmission of nerve impulses between a part of the body and the [[spinal cord]]. Two frequently used types of regional anesthesia are [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal anesthesia]] and [[epidural|epidural anesthesia]]. General anesthesia refers to inhibition of sensory, motor and sympathetic nerve transmission at the level of the brain, resulting in [[unconsciousness]] and lack of [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]]. Dissociative anesthesia uses agents that inhibit transmission of nerve impulses between higher centers of the brain (such as the [[cerebral cortex]]) and the lower centers, such as those found within the [[limbic system]].

Doctors specializing in perioperative care, development of an anesthetic plan, and the administration of anesthetics are known in the US as ''anesthesiologists'' and in the UK, Canada, Australia, and NZ as ''anaesthetists'' or ''anaesthesiologists''. All anesthetics in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan are administered by doctors. Nurse anesthetists also administer anesthesia in 109 nations.<ref name=IFNA>{{cite web|last=McAuliffe|first=MS|last2=Henry|first2=B|title=Nurse anesthesia worldwide: practice, education and regulation|work=Downloads|publisher=International Federation of Nurse Anesthetists|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|year=2010|url=http://ifna-int.org/ifna/e107_files/downloads/Practice.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> In the US, 35% of anesthetics are provided by physicians in solo practice, about 55% are provided by anesthesia care teams (ACTs) with anesthesiologists medically directing anesthesiologist assistants or certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and about 10% are provided by CRNAs in solo practice.<ref name=Physician2007>{{cite journal|last=Abenstein|first=JP|last2=Long|first2=KH|last3=McGlinch|first3=BP|last4=Dietz|first4=NM

[[File:Anesthesia patient simulator.jpg|thumb|Anesthesia students training with a patient simulator]]

In the strict sense, the term ''anesthetist'' refers to any individual who administers anesthesia. In the US, however, the term is most commonly employed to refer to registered nurses who have completed specialized education and training in anesthesia to become certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). In the US and Canada, medical doctors who specialize in anesthesiology are called ''anesthesiologists''. Such physicians in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand are called ''anaesthetists''.

In the US, a physician specializing in anesthesiology typically completes four years of college, four years of medical school, and four years of postgraduate medical training or residency<ref name=ACGME2011>{{cite web|author=ACGME Residency Review Committee: Anesthesiology|title=ACGME Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education in Anesthesiology, Effective: 1 July 2008|work=Review Committees: Anesthesiology|publisher=Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=2011-07-01|url=http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/downloads/RRC_progReq/040_anesthesiology_f07012011.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> According to the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]], [[anesthesiologist]]s provide or participate in more than ninety percent of the forty million anesthetics delivered annually.<ref name=ASAHQ>{{cite web|title=ASA Fast Facts: Anesthesiologists Provide Or Participate In 90 Percent Of All Annual Anesthetics|publisher=ASA|url=http://www.asahq.org/For-the-Public-and-Media/Press-Room/Anesthesia-Fast-Facts.aspx|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> In the UK, this training lasts a minimum of seven years after the awarding of a medical degree and two years of basic residency, and takes place under the supervision of the [[Royal College of Anaesthetists]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In Australia and New Zealand, it lasts five years after the awarding of a medical degree and two years of basic residency, under the supervision of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists.<ref name=ANZCA>{{cite web|title=Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists|url=http://www.anzca.edu.au|work=College website}}</ref> Other countries have similar systems, including Ireland (the Faculty of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland), Canada and South Africa (the College of Anaesthetists of South Africa).

In the US, satisfactory completion of the written and oral Board examinations allows an anesthesiologist to be called a "Diplomate" of the [[American Board of Anesthesiology]] or of the [[American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology]]. This is often referred to colloquially as being "Board Certified". In the UK, Fellowship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FRCA) is conferred upon medical doctors following satisfactory completion of the written and oral parts of the Royal College's examination.

The role of the anesthesiologist is no longer limited to the operation itself. Many anesthesiologists function as perioperative physicians, ensuring optimal analgesia and maintenance of physiologic [[homeostasis]] throughout the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. Anesthesiologists may elect to subspecialize in anesthesia for particular types of surgery (cardiothoracic, obstetrical, neurosurgical, pediatric), regional anesthesia, acute or chronic pain medicine, or Intensive Care Medicine.

Anesthesia providers are often trained using full scale human simulators. The field was an early adopter of this technology and has used it to train students and practitioners at all levels for the past several decades. Notable centers in the United States can be found at the Johns Hopkins Medicine Simulation Center,<ref name=Hopkins>{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins Medicine Simulation Center|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/simulation_center/index.html|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> Harvard's Center for Medical Simulation,<ref name=Harvard2009>{{cite web|title=The Center for Medical Simulation|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=2009|url=http://www.harvardmedsim.org/|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> Stanford,<ref name=stanford>{{cite web|title=MedSim-Eagle Patient Simulator – Simulation Center|publisher=Stanford University School of Medicine|url=http://med.stanford.edu/VAsimulator/medsim.html|accessdate=2010-11-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110104160100/http://med.stanford.edu/VAsimulator/medsim.html|archivedate=4 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The Mount Sinai School of Medicine HELPS Center in New York,<ref name=Sinai>{{cite web|title=Mount Sinai Simulation HELPS Center|url=http://msmc.affinitymembers.net/simulator/intro2.html|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> Duke University,<ref name=duke>{{cite web|title=Simcenter|url=http://simcenter.duke.edu/|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>and the University of Utah. <ref name=Utah>{{cite web|title=Center for Patient Simulation (Department of Anesthesiology)|url=http://medicine.utah.edu/anesthesiology/Education/patsim/index.htm |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

===Nurse anesthetists===
{{Main|Nurse anesthetist}}

In the United States, [[advanced practice nurse]]s specializing in the provision of anesthesia care are known as certified registered [[nurse anesthetist]]s (CRNAs). According to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, the 39,000 CRNAs in the US administer approximately 30 million anesthetics each year, roughly two thirds of the US total. 34% of nurse anesthetists practice in communities of less than 50,000. CRNAs start school with a bachelors degree in nursing and at least 1 year of acute care nursing experience, and gain a masters degree in nurse anesthesia before passing the mandatory Certification Exam. Masters-level CRNA training programs range in length from 24 to 36 months.

CRNAs may work with [[podiatrist]]s, dentists, [[anesthesiologist]]s, [[surgeons]], [[obstetricians]] and other professionals requiring their services. CRNAs administer anesthesia in all types of surgical cases, and are able to apply all the accepted anesthetic techniques—general, regional, local, or [[sedation]]. 34 states require physician supervision of a CRNA's practice, and hospitals can regulate what CRNAs can or can not do based on local laws.

In the United States, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS), a federal agency within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], determines the conditions for payment for all anesthesia services provided under the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) programs. For the purposes of payment for anesthesiology services, CMS defines an ''anesthesia practitioner'' as a physician who performs the anesthesia service alone, a CRNA who is not medically directed, or a CRNA or AA who is medically directed.<ref name=CMS2010>{{cite book|author=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services|title=Medicare Claims Processing Manual|chapter=Chapter 12, Section 50: Payment for Anesthesiology Services|pages=116–23|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|year=2010|url=http://www.cms.gov/manuals/downloads/clm104c12.pdf|accessdate=2010-11-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110108082532/http://www.cms.gov/manuals/downloads/clm104c12.pdf|archivedate=8 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Under the ''QZ'' Anesthesia Claims Modifier, CMS allows payment to a CRNA for anesthesiology services provided under these programs without medical direction by a physician.<ref name=CMS2010/> Furthermore, under CMS regulations, anesthesia must be administered only by:
* a qualified [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor of medicine]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic medicine]], dentist, [[oral surgeon]], or [[podiatrist]];
* a CRNA who, unless exempted, is under the supervision of the operating practitioner or of an anesthesiologist;
* an anesthesiologist's assistant who is under the supervision of an anesthesiologist.<ref name=CMS2002>{{cite book|author=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42|volume=3|chapter=IV: 42CFR482.52: Condition of participation: Anesthesia services|pages=490–1|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|year=2002|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2002/octqtr/42cfr482.52.htm|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

The aforementioned exemption for CRNAs is the ''State exemption'' (also referred to as an "opt-out"). Under the State exemption, if the State in which the hospital is located submits a letter to CMS requesting exemption from physician supervision of CRNAs, and that letter has been signed by the Governor of that State, then hospitals within that State may be exempted from the requirement for physician supervision of CRNAs.<ref name=CMS2002/> In 2001, CMS established this exemption for CRNAs from the physician supervision requirement by recognizing a Governor's written request to CMS attesting that it is in the best interests of the State's citizens to exercise this exemption.<ref name=CMSweb2010/> As of September 2010, sixteen states (California, Iowa, Nebraska, Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Kansas, North Dakota, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana and Colorado) have chosen to opt-out of the CRNA physician supervision regulation.<ref name=CMSweb2010>{{cite web|author=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|authorlink=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|title=Conditions for Coverage (CfCs) & Conditions of Participations (CoPs): Spotlight|publisher=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|location=Washington, DC|year=2010|url=http://www.cms.gov/CFCsAndCoPs/02_Spotlight.asp|accessdate=2010-11-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101105070704/http://www.cms.gov/CFCsAndCoPs/02_Spotlight.asp|archivedate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Anesthesiologist assistants===
{{Main|Anesthesiologist assistant}}
In the United States, anesthesiologist assistants (AAs) are graduate-level trained specialists who have undertaken specialized education and training to provide anesthesia care under the direction of an anesthesiologist. AAs typically hold a masters degree and practice under anesthesiologist supervision in 18 states and the District of Columbia through licensing, certification or physician delegation.<ref name=Five>{{cite web|title=Five facts about AAs|publisher=American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060926091707/http://www.anesthetist.org/content/view/14/38/|archivedate=2006-09-26|url=http://www.anesthetist.org/content/view/14/38/|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

In the UK, a similar group of assistants are currently being evaluated. They are referred to as "[[physician assistant]] (anaesthesia)" (PAA). Their background can be nursing, operating department practice, another of the allied medical professions, or even one of the natural sciences.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.nova.edu/chcs/healthsciences/anesthesia/forms/brochure.pdf</ref> Training is in the form of a postgraduate diploma and takes 27 months to complete.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

===Operating department practitioners===
{{Main|Operating Department Practitioners}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}

In the United Kingdom, [[Operating Department Practitioners|operating department practitioners]] provide assistance and support to the anesthetist or anesthesiologist. They can also assist the surgeon with surgical procedures and provide postoperative care to patients emerging from anesthesia. ODPs can be found in the operating department, accident and emergency department, intensive care unit, high dependency unit and in radiology, cardiology and endoscopy suites which require anesthesia support. They may also work with [[organ transplantation]] teams, as well as provide pre-hospital care to trauma victims. They are state-registered in the UK. The ODP is a [[Mid-level practitioner|mid-level]] [[medical practitioner|practitioner]] of [[perioperative medicine]]. ODPs also function as lecturers and trainers in [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], and work in management positions in operating departments.

===Veterinary anesthetists===
{{Main|Veterinary anesthesia}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}

Much of the equipment and drugs utilized by veterinary anesthetists is similar or identical to that used in anesthesia for human patients. There are vast differences in the physiology of different animal species, which may influence the choice of anesthetic agents and delivery systems in organisms ranging in diversity from (for example) [[annelid]]s to elephants. For many wild animals, anesthetic drugs must often be delivered from a distance by means of remote projector systems ("dart guns") before the animal can even be approached. Large domestic livestock can often be anesthetized for certain types of surgery in the standing position using only local anesthetics and sedative drugs. While most clinical veterinarians and veterinary technicians routinely function as anesthetists in the course of their professional duties, veterinary anesthesiologists in the U.S. are veterinarians who have completed a three year residency in anesthesia and have qualified for certification by the American College of Veterinary Anesthesiologists.

==Other personnel==
{{Further|Anaesthetic technician|Biomedical Equipment Technician|Surgical technologist}}

[[Anaesthetic technician|Anesthesia technicians]] are specially trained Anaesthetic Assistants,equivalent to Operating Department Practitioners in Great Britain. They do not administer anesthesia, but rather they assist anesthesia providers similar to the way in which [[Surgical technologist|scrub technicians]] assist surgeons. Commonly these services are collectively called perioperative services, and thus the term perioperative service technician (PST) is used interchangeably with anesthesia technician. In the United States, an anesthesia technician can become a [[Certified Anesthesia Technician]] (Cer.A.T.), followed by becoming a [[Certified Anesthesia Technologist]] (Cer.A.T.T.) through [[American Society of Anesthesia Technologists & Technicians]] (ASATT).<ref name=ASATT>{{cite web|title=ASATT Certification Information|publisher=American Society of Anesthesia Technologists & Technicians|url=http://www.asatt.org/cert.html|accessdate=2010-11-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101121182917/http://asatt.org/cert.html|archivedate=21 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In New Zealand, an anesthetic technician completes a course of study recognized by the [[NZATS|New Zealand Anaesthetic Technicians Society]].<ref name=nzats>[http://www.nzats.co.nz New Zealand Anaesthetic Technicians Society]</ref>

==Agents==
{{Further|Anesthetic|General anesthetic|Inhalational anesthetic|Local anesthetic}}

An anesthetic agent is a drug that brings about a state of anesthesia. A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice. Many are rarely used outside of anesthesia, although others are used commonly by all disciplines. Anesthetics are categorized into two categories: [[general anesthetic]]s cause a reversible loss of consciousness ([[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]]), while [[local anesthetic]]s cause reversible [[local anesthesia]] and a loss of [[nociception]].

==Equipment==
{{Further|Instruments used in anesthesiology|Anaesthetic machine}}

In modern anesthesia, a wide variety of medical equipment is desirable depending on the necessity for portable field use, surgical operations or intensive care support, and the type(s) of anesthetic(s) to be administered. Anesthesia practitioners must possess a comprehensive and intricate knowledge of the production and use of various medical gases, anesthetic agents and vapors, medical breathing circuits and the variety of [[anesthetic machine]]s (including vaporizers, ventilators and pressure gauges) and their corresponding safety features, hazards and limitations of each piece of equipment, for the safe, clinical competence and practical application for day to day practice.

The risk of transmission of infection by anesthetic equipment has been a problem since the beginnings of anesthesia. Although most equipment that comes into contact with patients is disposable, there is still a risk of contamination from the anesthetic machine itself<ref name=Baillie2007>{{cite journal|last=Baillie|first=JK|coauthors=P. Sultan, E. Graveling, C. Forrest, C. Lafong|title=Contamination of anesthetic machines with pathogenic organisms|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=62|issue=12|pages=1257–61|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2007.05261.x|pmid=17991263|url=}}</ref> or because of bacterial passage through protective filters.<ref name=Scott2010>{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=DHT|coauthors=S Fraser, P Willson, G B Drummond, J K Baillie|title=Passage of pathogenic microorganisms through breathing system filters used in anaesthesia and intensive care|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=65|issue=7|pages=670–3|year=2010|pmid=20374232|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2010.06327.x|url=}}</ref>

==Monitoring==
[[File:Maquet Flow-I anesthesia machine.jpg|thumb|An [[anesthetic machine]] with integrated systems for [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of several vital parameters.]]
Patients under general anesthesia must undergo continuous physiological [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] to ensure safety. In the US, the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation of the blood (pulse oximetry), and temperature.<ref name=ASAHQ>[http://asahq.org/For-Healthcare-Professionals/~/media/For%20Members/documents/Standards%20Guidelines%20Stmts/Basic%20Anesthetic%20Monitoring%202011.ashx STANDARDS FOR BASIC ANESTHETIC MONITORING]. Committee of Origin: Standards and Practice Parameters (Approved by the ASA House of Delegates on 21 October 1986, and last amended on 20 October 2010 with an effective date of 1 July 2011)</ref> In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of [[heart rate]], [[oxygen saturation]], [[blood pressure]], and inspired and expired concentrations for [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, [[central venous pressure]], [[pulmonary artery pressure]] and [[pulmonary wedge pressure|pulmonary artery occlusion pressure]], [[cardiac output]], cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, as well as for accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.

Effective July 1, 2011 the ASA implemented updated standards for patient monitoring.<ref name=beckershospitalreview>[http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/anesthesia/asas-standards-revision-focusing-on-ventilation-methods-goes-into-effect-july-1.html ASA's Standards Revision Focusing on Ventilation Methods Goes Into Effect July 1|Anesthesia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Record==
The anesthesia record is the medical and legal documentation of events while a patient is under anesthesia.<ref name=Stoelting1994>Stoelting RK, Miller RD: Basics of Anesthesia, 3rd edition, 1994.</ref> It should contain a detailed and continuous account of all drugs, fluids, and blood products administered and procedures undertaken, and also includes the observation of cardiovascular responses, estimated blood loss, urine output and data from physiologic monitors while a patient is under anesthesia.

Traditionally handwritten on paper, the anesthesia record is increasingly being replaced by an electronic record as part of an Anesthesia Information Management System (AIMS), especially since 2007.<ref name=0b013e31818322d2>{{cite journal|title=Adoption of Anesthesia Information Management Systems by Academic Departments in the United States|pages=1323|doi=10.1213/ane.0b013e31818322d2|year=2008|last1=Egger Halbeis|first1=Christoph B.|last2=Epstein|first2=Richard H.|last3=MacArio|first3=Alex|last4=Pearl|first4=Ronald G.|last5=Grunwald|first5=Zvi|journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia|volume=107|issue=4}}</ref> An AIMS is any [[information system]] that is used as an automated electronic anesthesia record keeper (i.e., connection to patient physiologic monitors and/or the [[anesthetic machine]]) and which also may allow the collection and [[analysis]] of anesthesia-related perioperative patient data gathered from monitors and/or the anesthesia machine. These systems typically run on medical-grade hardware in the operating room. AIMS can be stand-alone systems or integrated modules of a [[hospital information system]]. AIMS have several benefits to the anesthesia departments as well to the hospital administration as documented in the scientific literature:

===Plant derivatives===
Throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas a variety of ''[[Solanum]]'' species containing potent [[tropane alkaloid]]s were used, such as [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]], [[Hyoscyamus niger|henbane]], [[Datura metel]], and [[Datura inoxia]]. Ancient Greek and Roman medical texts by [[Hippocrates]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], and [[Pliny the Elder]] discussed the use of opium and ''Solanum'' species. In 13th century Italy, [[Theodoric Borgognoni]] used similar mixtures along with opiates to induce unconsciousness, and treatment with the combined alkaloids proved a mainstay of anesthesia until the nineteenth century. In the Americas [[coca]] was also an important anesthetic used in [[Trepanning|trephining]] operations. [[Inca civilization|Incan]] [[Shamanism|shamans]] chewed coca leaves and performed operations on the skull while spitting into the wounds they had inflicted to anesthetize the site.<ref name=Ruetsch2001>{{cite journal|last=Ruetsch|first=YA|last2=Böni|first2=T|last3=Borgeat|first3=A|title=From Cocaine to Ropivacaine: The History of Local Anesthetic Drugs|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=175–82|year=2001|doi=10.2174/1568026013395335|pmid=11895133}}</ref> [[Ethanol|Alcohol]] was also used, its [[vasodilation|vasodilatory]] properties being unknown. Ancient herbal anesthetics have variously been called [[Hypnotic|soporifics]], [[anodyne]]s, and [[narcotic]]s, depending on whether the emphasis is on producing unconsciousness or relieving pain.

The use of herbal anesthesia had a crucial drawback compared to modern practice—as lamented by [[Gabriele Falloppio|Fallopius]], "When soporifics are weak, they are useless, and when strong, they kill." To overcome this, production was typically standardized as much as feasible, with production occurring from specific locations (such as opium from the fields of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in ancient Egypt). Anesthetics were sometimes administered in the "spongia somnifera", a sponge into which a large quantity of drug was allowed to dry, from which a saturated solution could be trickled into the nose of the patient. At least in more recent centuries, trade was often highly standardized, with the drying and packing of [[opium]] in standard chests, for example. In the 19th century, varying aconitum alkaloids from a variety of species were standardized by testing with [[guinea pig]]s. Trumping this method was the discovery of [[morphine]], a purified alkaloid that could be injected by [[hypodermic needle]] for a consistent dosage. The enthusiastic reception of morphine led to the foundation of the modern pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=Kaadan>{{cite journal|last=Kaadan|first=A|last2=Ghafeer|first2=B|title=History of Anesthesia|journal=Chronicles of Anesthesia|pages=34|url=http://www.docs.google.com|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

The first effective local anesthetic was [[cocaine]]. Isolated in 1859, it was first used by [[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]], at the suggestion of [[Sigmund Freud]], in [[eye surgery]] in 1884.<ref name=Koller1884>{{cite journal|last=Koller|first=K|authorlink=Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|title=Über die verwendung des kokains zur anästhesierung am auge|trans_title=On the use of cocaine for anesthesia on the eye|language=German|journal=Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift|volume=34|pages=1276–1309|year=1884}}</ref> German surgeon [[August Bier]] (1861–1949) was the first to use cocaine for [[intrathecal]] anesthesia in 1898.<ref name=Bier1899>{{cite journal|last=Bier|first=A|authorlink=August Bier|title=Versuche über cocainisirung des rückenmarkes|trans_title=Experiments on the cocainization of the spinal cord|language=German|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift für Chirurgie|volume=51|issue=3–4|pages=361–9|year=1899|doi=10.1007/BF02792160}}</ref> Romanian surgeon Nicolae Racoviceanu-Piteşti (1860–1942) was the first to use [[opioid]]s for intrathecal analgesia; he presented his experience in Paris in 1901.<ref name=Brill2003>{{cite journal|last=Brill|first=S|last2=Gurman|first2=GM|last3=Fisher|first3=A|title=A history of neuraxial administration of local analgesics and opioids|journal=European Journal of Anaesthesiology|volume=20|issue=9|pages=682–9|year=2003|issn=0265-0215|pmid=12974588|doi=10.1017/S026502150300111X|url=}}</ref> A number of newer local anesthetic agents, many of them derivatives of cocaine, were synthesized in the 20th century, including eucaine (1900), [[amylocaine]] (1904), [[procaine]] (1905), and [[lidocaine]] (1943).

===Early inhalational anesthetics===

[[File:Southworth & Hawes - First etherized operation (re-enactment).jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary re-enactment of Morton's 16 October 1846, [[diethyl ether|ether]] operation; [[daguerrotype]] by [[Southworth & Hawes]]]]

Early Arab writings mention anesthesia by inhalation. This idea was the basis of the "soporific sponge" ("sleep sponge"), introduced by the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|Salerno school of medicine]] in the late twelfth century and by [[Ugo Borgognoni]] (1180–1258) in the thirteenth century. The sponge was promoted and described by Ugo's son and fellow surgeon, [[Theodoric Borgognoni]] (1205–1298). In this anesthetic method, a sponge was soaked in a dissolved solution of opium, [[mandragora]], hemlock juice, and other substances. The sponge was then dried and stored; just before surgery the sponge was moistened and then held under the patient's nose. When all went well, the fumes rendered the patient unconscious.

In 1275, Spanish physician [[Raymond Lullus]], while experimenting with chemicals, made a volatile, flammable liquid he called sweet vitriol.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Sweet vitriol, or sweet oil of vitriol, was the first inhalational anesthetic used for surgical anesthesia. It is no longer used often because of its flammability. In the 16th century, a Swiss-born physician commonly known as [[Paracelsus]] made chickens breathe sweet vitriol and noted that they not only fell asleep but also felt no pain. Like Lullus before him, he did not experiment on humans. In 1730, German chemist [[Frobenius]] gave this liquid its present name, [[Diethyl ether|ether]], which is Greek for “heavenly.” But 112 more years would pass before ether’s anesthetic powers were fully appreciated.

Meanwhile, in 1772, English scientist [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered the gas [[nitrous oxide]]. Initially, people thought this gas to be lethal, even in small doses. However, in 1799, British chemist and inventor [[Humphry Davy]] decided to find out by experimenting on himself. To his astonishment he found that nitrous oxide made him laugh, so he nicknamed it laughing gas. Davy wrote about the potential anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide, but nobody at that time pursued the matter any further.

American physician [[Crawford W. Long]] noticed that his friends felt no pain when they injured themselves while staggering around under the influence of ether. He immediately thought of its potential in surgery. Conveniently, a participant in one of those “ether frolics,” a student named James Venable, had two small tumors he wanted excised. But fearing the pain of surgery, Venable kept putting the operation off. Hence, Long suggested that he have his operation while under the influence of ether. Venable agreed, and on 30 March 1842 he underwent a painless operation. However, Long did not announce his discovery until 1849.<ref name=Long1849>{{cite journal|last=Long|first=CW|authorlink=Crawford Long|title=An account of the first use of Sulphuric Ether by Inhalation as an Anesthetic in Surgical Operations|journal=Southern Medical and Surgical Journal|volume=5|pages=705–713|year=1849}}</ref>

[[William T. G. Morton|William Thomas Green Morton]], a Boston dentist, conducted the first public demonstration of the inhalational anesthetic. Morton, who was unaware of Long's previous work, was invited to the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] to demonstrate his new technique for painless surgery. After Morton had induced anesthesia, surgeon [[John Collins Warren]] removed a tumor from the neck of [[Edward Gilbert Abbott]]. This occurred in the surgical amphitheater now called the [[Ether Dome]]. The previously skeptical Warren was impressed and stated "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." In a letter to Morton shortly thereafter, physician and writer [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] proposed naming the state produced "anesthesia", and the procedure an "anesthetic".<ref name=Fenster2001>{{cite book|last=Fenster|first=JM|title=Ether Day: The Strange Tale of America's Greatest Medical Discovery and the Haunted Men Who Made It|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|year=2001|chapter=Power Struggle|pages=106–16|isbn=978-0-06-019523-6|url=}}</ref>

Morton at first attempted to hide the actual nature of his anesthetic substance, referring to it as Letheon. He received a [[US patent]] for his substance, but news of the successful anesthetic spread quickly by late 1846. Respected surgeons in Europe including [[Robert Liston|Liston]], [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach|Dieffenbach]], [[Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov|Pirogov]], and [[James Syme|Syme]], quickly undertook numerous operations with ether. An American-born physician, Boott, encouraged London dentist James Robinson to perform a dental procedure on a Miss Lonsdale. This was the first case of an operator-anesthetist. On the same day, 19 December 1846, in Dumfries Royal Infirmary, Scotland, a Dr. Scott used ether for a surgical procedure.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first use of anesthesia in the Southern Hemisphere took place in [[Launceston, Tasmania]], that same year. Drawbacks with ether such as excessive vomiting and its [[flammability]] led to its replacement in England with [[chloroform]].

Discovered in 1831, the use of chloroform in anesthesia is linked to [[James Young Simpson]], who, in a wide-ranging study of organic compounds, found chloroform's efficacy on 4 November 1847. Its use spread quickly and gained royal approval in 1853 when [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] gave it to [[Queen Victoria]] during the birth of [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Prince Leopold]]. Unfortunately, chloroform is not as safe an agent as ether, especially when administered by an untrained practitioner ([[medical school|medical students]], nurses, and occasionally members of the public were often pressed into giving anesthetics at this time). This led to many deaths from the use of chloroform that (with hindsight) might have been preventable. The first fatality directly attributed to chloroform anesthesia was recorded on 28 January 1848 after the death of Hannah Greener.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

John Snow of London published articles from May 1848 onwards "On Narcotism by the Inhalation of Vapours" in the London Medical Gazette. Snow also involved himself in the production of equipment needed for the administration of [[inhalational anesthetics]].
