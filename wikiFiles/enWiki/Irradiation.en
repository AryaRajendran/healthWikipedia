{{selfref|This article is about the [[physics]] of irradiation. See [[irradiation illusion]] for information about a visual illusion.}}

'''Irradiation''' is the process by which an object is exposed to [[radiation]]. The exposure can originate from various sources, including natural sources. Most frequently the term refers to [[ionizing radiation]], and to a level of radiation that will serve a specific purpose, rather than [[radiation]] exposure to normal levels of [[background radiation]]. The term irradiation usually excludes the exposure to non-ionizing radiation, such as microwaves from cellular phones or electromagnetic waves emitted by radio and TV receivers and power supplies.

== Applications ==

===Sterilization===

If administered at appropriate levels, all of these forms of radiation can be used to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] objects, a technique used in the production of medical instruments and disposables, such as [[syringe]]s as well as in the disinfestation and [[Food irradiation|sterilization of food]]. Small doses of ionizing radiation ([[electron beam processing]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/rad_in_food/irradfoodqa/ |title=Food Standards Agency - Irradiated food |accessdate=2008-01-26 |format= |work=}}</ref> may be used to kill bacteria in food, or other organic material, including blood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Irradiation also includes (by the principle) [[microwave heating]]. [[Food irradiation]], while effective, is seldom used due to public relations problems.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html "Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation"] article by [[Andrew Marin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''  February 1, 2009</ref>

===Medicine===

It is also used in [[Diagnostic Imaging]], [[radiation therapy|cancer therapy]] and [[blood transfusion]]. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html "Information for patients needing irradiated blood"] by [[National Blood Service]]</ref>

In 2011 researchers found that irradiation was successful in the novel [[theranostic]] technique involving the co-treatment with [[heptamethine dyes]] to elucidate tumor cells and attenuate growth with minimal side effects.<ref name=Tan>Tan X, Luo S, Wang D, et al.

Courtine, A. Cariou, J.P. Mira.  Toward theranostics.  Crit Care Med, 37 (2009), pp. S50–S58</ref>

===Ion implantation===
{{Main|Ion implantation}}

Ion irradiation is routinely used to implant impurity [[atom]]s into materials, especially
[[semiconductor]]s, to modify their properties. This process, usually known
as [[ion implantation]], is a very important step in the manufacturing of silicon 
[[integrated circuit]]s.

===Ion irradiation===

The irradiation of solids by [[swift heavy ions]] from [[particle accelerators]] induces [[ion tracks]] which can be used for [[nanotechnology]].

===Industrial chemistry===

Irradiation can furthermore be used in [[cross-link]]ing of [[plastics]] or to improve material qualities of [[semi-precious stones]]. Due to its efficiency, [[electron beam processing]] is often used in the irradiation treatment of polymer-based products to improve the mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and often adding unique properties. [[Cross-linked polyethylene]] pipe (PEX), high-temperature products such as tubing and gaskets, wire and cable jacket curing, curing of composite materials, and crosslinking of tires are a few examples.

===Security===

During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], the [[US Postal Service]] [[irradiated mail]] to protect members of the US government and other possible targets.  This can be of some concern to people, including artists; according to the ART in Embassies program "incoming mail is irradiated, and the process destroys slides, transparencies and disks."[http://aiep.state.gov/submit.html]

=== Agriculture ===

After its discovery by Lewis Stadler at the [[University of Missouri]], irradiation of [[seed]] and plant [[germplasm]] has resulted in creating many of the most widely grown strains of [[food crop]]s worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  The process, which consists of striking plant seeds or germplasm by radiation in the form of [[X-ray]]s, [[UV radiation|UV waves]], [[ion beam|heavy-ion beams]], [[gamma ray]]s, essentially "mixes" the genes already existing in [[genome]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.  The UN has been active in this through the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.  Irradiation is also employed to prevent sprouting of certain [[cereal]]s, [[onion]]s, [[potato]]es and [[garlic]].<ref>Bly, J.H. "Electron Beam Processing", Yardley, PA: International Information Associates, 1988.</ref>  Appropriate irradiation doses are also used to produce sterile insects to be used in the [[sterile insect technique]].<ref>[http://www-ididas.iaea.org/IDIDAS/default.htm International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization], Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture website, [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], plus the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].</ref>

{{main|Food irradiation}}

The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recognizes irradiation as an important technology to [[food safety|protecting consumers]]. Fresh [[meat]] and [[poultry]] including whole or cut up birds, skinless poultry, [[pork chop]]s, [[roast]]s, [[stew meat]], liver, [[hamburger]]s, [[ground meat]], and ground poultry are approved for irradiation.<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Irradiation_and_Food_Safety/index.asp Irradiation and Food Safety], U.S. Drug and Food Administration. Retrieved Jan. 5, 2010.</ref>

===Assassination===

[[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] died of lung cancer in Bucharest on March 19, 1965. Some claim that he was intentionally irradiated during a visit to Moscow, due to his political stance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefinalphaseforum.invisionzone.com/lofiversion/index.php/t1487-50.html|title=TFP > Alexander Litvinenko Assassination|accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

In 1999, an article in [[Der Spiegel]] alleged that the East German [[Stasi|MfS]] intentionally irradiated political prisoners with high-dose radiation, possibly to provoke cancer in them.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13395385.html ''STASI: In Kopfhöhe ausgerichtet.''] Article by Peter Wensierski in [[Der Spiegel]] 20/1999, May 17, 1999</ref><ref>[http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv00/160yy47.htm ''Tödliche Strahlung. Die Staatssicherheit der DDR steht im Verdacht, Regimegegner radioaktiv verseucht zu haben.''] Article by Paul Leonhard in ''Junge Freiheit'' April 14, 2000</ref>

[[Alexander Litvinenko]] was intentionally poisoned with Po-210 which subsequently killed with the very large internal doses of radiation he was receiving.
