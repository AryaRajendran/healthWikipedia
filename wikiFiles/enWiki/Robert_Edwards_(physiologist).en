==Early career==
Edwards was born in [[Batley]], [[Yorkshire]].<ref name="kolataobit">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/us/robert-g-edwards-nobel-winner-for-in-vitro-fertilization-dies-at-87.html?hpw |title=Robert G.

After a year as a research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]] he joined the scientific staff of the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] at Mill Hill. After a further year at [[Glasgow University]], in 1963 he moved to [[Cambridge University]] as Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology, and a member of [[Churchill College]]. He was appointed Reader in physiology in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|author=6:23PM BST 10 Apr 2013 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/9984988/Professor-Sir-Robert-Edwards.html |title=Professor Sir Robert Edwards |publisher=Telegraph |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref>

==Human fertilisation==
{{further|in vitro fertilisation}}
Circa 1960 Edwards started to study human [[fertilisation]], and he continued his work at Cambridge, laying the groundwork for his later success. In 1968 he was able to achieve fertilisation of a human egg in the laboratory and started to collaborate with [[Patrick Steptoe]], a [[gynecologic]] surgeon from [[Oldham]]. Edwards developed human culture media to allow the fertilisation and early [[embryo]] culture, while Steptoe utilized [[laparoscopy]] to recover [[ovocyte]]s from patients with tubal [[infertility]]. Their attempts met significant hostility and opposition,<ref name="pz_opposition">{{cite web| author=Myers, PZ | url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/a_surprising_nobel.php |title=A surprising Nobel | date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> including a refusal of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] to fund their research and a number of lawsuits.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=New York Times | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/research/05nobel.html | title=Pioneer of in Vitro Fertilization Wins Nobel Prize | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | date=October 4, 2010 | accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref> Additional historical information on this controversial era in the development of IVF has been published.<ref>Joseph D. Schulman, M.D., 2010. "Robert G. Edwards – A Personal Viewpoint"</ref> 

The birth of [[Louise Brown]], the world's first 'test-tube baby', at {{Nowrap|11:47 pm}} on {{Nowrap|25 July}} 1978 at the [[Oldham General Hospital]] made medical history: in vitro fertilisation meant a new way to help infertile couples who formerly had no possibility of having a baby.

Refinements in technology have increased pregnancy rates and it is estimated that in 2010 about {{Nowrap|4 million}} children have been born by IVF,<ref name="nobelpr"/> with approximately 170,000 coming from donated [[oocyte]] and [[embryos]].<ref>http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm/pdf/first_live_birth_donation.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm.asp?id=5030 |title=Home — OBG Management |publisher=Obgmanagement.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theafa.org/library/article/talking_with_children_about_ovum_donation_2009 |title=Library |publisher=TheAFA.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref> Their breakthrough laid the groundwork for further innovations such as intracytoplasmatic sperm injection [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]], embryo biopsy ([[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|PGD]]), and [[stem cell]] research.

Edwards and Steptoe founded the [[Bourn Hall Clinic]] as a place to advance their work and train new specialists. Steptoe died in 1988. Edwards continued on in his career as a scientist and an [[editing|editor]] of medical journals.
