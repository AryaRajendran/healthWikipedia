==Signs and symptoms==
Most infections are light and [[asymptomatic]]. In heavy infections, symptoms can include [[abdominal pain]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[diarrhea]], [[anemia]], [[ascites]], [[Bacteremia|toxemia]], [[allergy|allergic responses]], sensitization caused by the absorption of the worms' allergenic metabolites (may eventually cause death of patient), and intestinal obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bhattacharjee HK, Yadav D, Bagga D. |title=Fasciolopsiasis presenting as intestinal perforation: a case report |journal=Trop Gastroenterol |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=40–1 |year=2001|pmid=19624087}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Microscopic identification of eggs, or more rarely of the adult [[trematoda|flukes]], in the [[feces|stool]] or [[vomitus]] is the basis of specific diagnosis. The eggs are indistinguishable from those of ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]''.

==Cause==

The parasite infects an amphibic [[snail]] (''[[Segmentina nitidella]], [[Segmentina hemisphaerula]], [[Hippeutis schmackerie]], [[Gyraulus]], [[Lymnaea]], Pila, [[Planorbis]] ([[Indoplanorbis]])'') after being released by infected feces; from this [[intermediate host]], [[cercaria|metacercaria]] infest on [[aquatic plant]]s like [[water spinach]], which are eaten raw by pigs and humans. Also, the water is possibly infective when drunk unheated ("''Encysted cercariae exist not only on [[aquatic plant]]s, but also on the surface of the water.''")<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weng YL, Zhuang ZL, Jiang HP, Lin GR, Lin JJ |title=Studies on ecology of Fasciolopsis buski and control strategy of fasciolopsiasis |language=Chinese|journal=Zhongguo Ji Sheng Chong Xue Yu Ji Sheng Chong Bing Za Zhi |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=108–11|year=1989 |pmid=2805255 }}</ref>

==Prevention==
Prevention can be easily achieved by immersion of vegetables in boiling water for a few seconds to kill the infective metacercariae,  avoiding the use of feces ("nightsoil") as a fertilizer, and maintenance of proper sanitation and good hygiene. Additionally, [[snail]] control should be attempted.

==Treatment==
[[Praziquantel]] is the [[drug]] of choice for treatment. Treatment is effective in early or light infections. Heavy infections are more difficult to treat. Studies of the effectiveness of various drugs for treatment of children with ''F. buski'' have shown [[tetrachloroethylene]] as capable of reducing faecal egg counts by up to 99%. Other [[anthelmintics]] that can be used include [[thiabendazole]], [[mebendazole]], [[levamisole]] and [[pyrantel pamoate]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rabbani GH, Gilman RH, Kabir I, Mondel G | year = 1985 | title = The treatment of ''Fasciolopsis buski'' infection in children: a comparison of thiabendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, pyrantel pamoate, hexylresorcinol and tetrachloroethylene | journal = Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 513–5 | doi = 10.1016/0035-9203(85)90081-1 | pmid = 4082261 }}</ref> [[oxyclozanide]], [[hexachlorophene]] and nitroxynil are also highly effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Probert AJ, Sharma RK, Singh K, Saxena R. |title=The effect of five fasciolicides on malate dehydrogenase activity and mortality of ''Fasciola gigantica'', ''Fasciolopsis buski'' and ''Paramphistomum explanatum''|journal=J Helminthol |volume=55 |pages=115–22 |year=1981 |doi=10.1017/S0022149X0002558X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=5155408 |pmid=7264272|issue=2}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Mapfbuski1.jpg|thumb|Distribution of ''Fasciolopsis buski'']]
''F. buski'' is endemic in [[Asia]] including [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South-East Asia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[India]]. It has a prevalence of up to 60% in [[India]] and mainland [[China]] and has an estimated 10 million human infections. Infections occur most often in school-age children or in impoverished areas with a lack of proper sanitation systems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Keiser J, Utzinger J. |title=Food-borne trematodiases |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev. |volume=22 |issue=3|pages=466–83 |year=2009 |pmid=19597009 |pmc=2708390 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00012-09}}</ref>

A study revealed that ''F. buski'' was endemic in central [[Thailand]], affecting approximately 2,936 people due to infected aquatic plants called [[water caltrop]]s and the snail hosts which were associated with them. The infection, or the eggs which hatch in the aquatic environment were correlated with the water pollution in different districts of [[Thailand]] such as Ayuthaya Province. The high incidence of infection was prevalent in females and children ages 10–14 years of age.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Sadun EH, Maiphoom C | year = 1953 | title = Studies on the epidemiology of the human intestinal fluke, ''Fasciolopsis Buski'' in Central Thailand | journal = American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 2 | issue = 6| pages = 1070–84 | pmid = 13104816 }}</ref>
