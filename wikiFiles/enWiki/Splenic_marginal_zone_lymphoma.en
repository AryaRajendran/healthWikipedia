'''Splenic marginal zone lymphoma''' (SMZL) is a [[lymphoma]] made up of [[B-cells]] that replace the normal architecture of the [[white pulp]] of the [[spleen]]. The neoplastic cells are both small [[lymphocytes]] and larger, transformed [[blasts]], and they invade the [[mantle zone]] of [[splenic]] [[lymph follicle|follicles]] and erode the [[marginal zone]], ultimately invading the red pulp of the spleen. Frequently, the bone marrow and [[splenic]] [[hilum (anatomy)|hilar]] [[lymph nodes]] are involved along with the peripheral [[blood]]. The neoplastic cells circulating in the peripheral blood are termed [[villous lymphocytes]] due to their characteristic appearance.<ref name="who1">{{cite book |author=Elaine Sarkin Jaffe, Nancy Lee Harris, World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Harald Stein, J.W.

==Cause==
The cell of origin is postulated to be a post-germinal center B-cell with an unknown degree of differentiation.<ref name="who1"/>

==Diagnosis==
With splenic involvement a requirement for a diagnosis of SMZL, [[splenomegaly]] is seen in almost all patients, commonly without lymphadenopathy.<ref name="who1"/>  Aside from the uniform involvement of the [[spleen]], the [[bone marrow]] is frequently positive in patients with SMZL. Nodal and extranodal involvement are rare.<ref name="who1"/> 

Circulating [[lymphoma]] cells are sometimes present in peripheral [[blood]], and they occasionally show short villi at the poles of cells and plasmacytoid differentiation.<ref name="mel1">{{cite journal |author=Melo JV, Hegde U, Parreira A, Thompson I, Lampert IA, Catovsky D |title=Splenic B cell lymphoma with circulating villous lymphocytes: differential diagnosis of B cell leukaemias with large spleens |journal=J.

[[Autoimmune thrombocytopenia]] and [[anemia]] sometimes seen in patients with SMZL.

[[Reactive germinal centers]] in [[splenic]] [[white pulp]] are replaced by small neoplastic [[lymphocytes]] that efface the [[mantle zone]] and ultimately blend in with the [[marginal zone]] with occasional larger neoplastic cells that resemble [[blasts]].<ref name="mol1"/><ref name="jaf1">

The [[red pulp]] is always involved, with both nodules of larger neoplastic cells and sheets of the small neoplastic [[lymphocytes]]. Other features that may be seen include [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] invasion, [[epithelial histocytes]], and plasmacytic differentiation of neoplastic cells.

Involved hilar [[lymph nodes]] adjacent to the [[spleen]] show an effaced architecture without preservation of the [[marginal zone]] seen in the spleen.<ref name="who1"/> 

SMZL in [[bone marrow]] displays a nodular pattern with morphology similar to what is observed in the splenic [[hilum (anatomy)|hilar]] [[lymph nodes]].<ref name="fra1">{{cite journal |author=Franco V, Florena AM, Campesi G |title=Intrasinusoidal bone marrow infiltration: a possible hallmark of splenic lymphoma |journal=Histopathology |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=571–5 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8971565 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2559.1996.d01-536.x }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Three-quarters of patients survive five or more years; more than half of patients with SMZL survive more than a decade after diagnosis.<ref name="Arcaini2006">{{cite journal|last=Arcaini|first=L.|year=2006|title=Splenic marginal zone lymphoma: a prognostic model for clinical use|journal=Blood|volume=107|issue=12|pages=4643–4649|issn=0006-4971|doi=10.1182/blood-2005-11-4659}}</ref>

Patients who have a hemoglobin level of less than 12 g/dL, a [[lactate dehydrogenase]] level higher than normal, and/or a blood serum [[albumin]] levels of less than 3.5 g/dL are likely to have more a aggressive disease course and a shorter survival.<ref name="Arcaini2006" />  However, even high-risk patients have even odds of living for five years after diagnosis.<ref name="Arcaini2006" />

Some genetic mutations, such as mutations in ''NOTCH2'', are also correlated with shorter survival.

The  lack of [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]] expression is helpful in the discrimination between SMZL and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]/[[small lymphocytic lymphoma]], and the lack of [[CD10]] expression argues against [[follicular lymphoma]]. [[Mantle cell lymphoma]] is excluded due to the lack of [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]] and [[cyclin-D1]] expression.<ref name="sav1">
