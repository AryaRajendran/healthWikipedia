The conception of a '''maternal impression''' rests on the belief that a powerful mental (or sometimes physical) influence working on the mother's mind may produce an impression, either general or definite, on the child she is carrying.<ref>Havelock Ellis, ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', vol. 5 p. 218</ref>  The child might be said to be "marked" as a result.

==Medicine==
Maternal impression, according to a [[obsolete scientific theory|long-discredited]] [[medicine|medical]] theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of [[birth defect]]s and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an [[emotion]]al [[stimulation|stimulus]] experienced by a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman could influence the development of the [[fetus]]. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] was frightened by an [[elephant]] during her pregnancy, thus "imprinting" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a [[pregnant]] woman who experienced great sadness might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her [[uterus]].

The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern [[genetics|genetic theory]].

==Folklore==
In [[folklore]], maternal imprinting, or '''Versehen'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "inadvertance" or as a verb "to provide") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.

[[Oswald Spengler]] understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called "blood feeling" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:
<blockquote>What is called the ''Versehen'' of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would "prove" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on ''one bodily ideal'', so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.<ref>Spengler, Oswald, The Decline of the West, Knopf, NYC, 1928, vol. 2 p. 126</ref></blockquote>

[[Pliny the Elder]] also comments at length about the phenomenon of ''postpartum'' maternal impression in bears.<ref>Pliny Natural History VIII:126</ref>
