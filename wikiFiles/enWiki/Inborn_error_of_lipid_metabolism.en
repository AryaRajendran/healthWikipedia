Numerous [[genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in '''[[fatty acid]] [[metabolism]]'''. These disorders may be described as [[fatty oxidation disorder]]s or as a ''[[lipid storage disorder]]s'', and are any one of several [[inborn errors of metabolism]] that result from enzyme defects affecting the ability of the body to [[oxidize]] [[fatty acid]]s in order to produce energy within muscles, liver, and other [[cell (biology)|cell]] types.

Some of the more common fatty acid metabolism disorders are:

==Coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiencies==
* [[Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (VLCAD) - [[Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]
* [[Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (LCHAD) - [[Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A]]
* [[Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (MCAD) - [[Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]
* [[Short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (SCAD) - [[Short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]
* [[3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (HADH) - [[3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]

==Other Coenzyme A enzyme deficiencies==
* [[2,4 Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency]] - [[2,4 Dienoyl-CoA reductase]]
* [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency]] - [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase]]
* [[Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency]] - [[Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase]]

==Carnitine related==
* [[Primary carnitine deficiency]] - [[SLC22A5]] (carnitine transporter)
* [[Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency]] - [[Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase]]
* [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency]] (CPT) - [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]]
* [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency]] (CPT) - [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]]

==Lipid storage==

**[[Cholesteryl ester storage disease]]
*[[Gaucher disease]]
*[[Niemann-Pick disease]]
*[[Fabry disease]]
*[[Farber’s disease]]
*[[Gangliosidoses]]

* [[Electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase deficiency|Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) dehydrogenase deficiency]] (GAII & MADD)
