'''Spray-on skin''' is a [[patent]]ed [[skin]] culturing treatment for burns victims, developed by scientist Marie Stoner and [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] [[Fiona Wood|Dr Fiona Wood]] of [[Perth, Western Australia]].
Wood's treatment is under ongoing development. Where previous techniques of skin culturing required 21 days to produce enough cells to cover major burns, Wood has reduced the period to five days. Through research, she found that scarring is greatly reduced if replacement skin could be provided within 10 days. Dr Wood's reported goal is "scarless woundless healing".<ref>[http://www.australianoftheyear.gov.au/pages/page59.asp Australian of the Year recipient profile]</ref>

Wood established a company called [[Clinical Cell Culture]] (C3) in 1993 to commercialise the procedure. Her business came about after a schoolteacher arrived at Royal Perth Hospital in 1992 with petrol burns to 90% of his body. Wood turned to the emerging US-invented technology of cultured skin to save his life, working nights in a laboratory along with scientist Marie Stoner. The two women began to explore tissue engineering and moved from growing skin sheets to spraying skin cells. <ref>[http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/pharmaceuticals/spray_on_skin.html Spray on Skin]</ref>

As well as receiving praise from both her own patients and the media,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} she also attracted controversy among other burns surgeons because spray-on skin had not yet been subjected to clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Jury-still-out-over-sprayon-skin/2005/01/28/1106850110963.html | title=Jury still out over 'spray-on skin' | work = [[The Age]] | date = January 29, 2005 | author = Carol Nader | accessdate = 2007-12-19}}</ref> A clinical trial is planned at Queen Victoria Hospital, England.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4208746.stm | title = Spray-on cells treat severe burns | date = 5 September 2005 | work = bbc.co.uk | accessdate = 2007-12-19}}</ref>
