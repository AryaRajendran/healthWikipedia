'''Dracunculiasis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|d|r|ə|ˌ|k|ʌ|ŋ|k|j|ʉ|ˈ|l|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɪ|s}}), also called '''guinea worm disease''' ('''GWD'''), is a nodular [[dermatosis]] produced by the development of [[Dracunculus (animal)|Dracunculus]] [[parasite]] in the subcutaneous tissue of mammals. ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'' has been reported in humans, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and other animals in Africa and Asia. A similar species of the ''Dracunculus'' genus, ''D. insignis'', is a parasite which causes Dracunculiasis in dogs, raccoons, minks, foxes, otters, and skunks of North America.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.mckeevervetderm.com/media/a64feeb0eefd8b52ffff80bbffffd502.pdf | title = Dracunculiasis}}</ref> ''Dracunculus medinensis'' is a long and very thin [[nematode]] (roundworm).<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |last = James | first = WD |title= Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |page=437 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |author-separator = , |author2 = Berger TG }}</ref> The parasite enters a host by way of host ingestion of [[Water stagnation|stagnant water]] contaminated with [[copepod]]s (water fleas) infested with guinea worm [[larva]]e. Approximately one year later, the disease presents with a painful, burning sensation as the female worm forms a blister, usually on the lower limb. 

Once prevalent in 20 nations in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], the disease remains [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] among humans in only four countries in [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://blog.google.org/2011/08/no-more-guinea-worm-in-ghana.html | title = No more Guinea worm in Ghana! | publisher = google.org}}</ref>

The guinea worm is one of the best historically documented human parasites, with tales of its behaviour reaching as far back as the 2nd century BC in accounts penned by Greek chroniclers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Piper R |year=2007 |title = Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=[[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]] |isbn=978-0-313-33922-6 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=eqegRf2UstIC&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false 189–91]}}</ref> It is also mentioned in the Egyptian medical [[Ebers Papyrus]], dating from 1550&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = International Society of Radiology | title = Guinea Worm Infection (Dracunculiasis)|author = Palmer and Reeder | url = http://www.isradiology.org/tropical_deseases/tmcr/chapter27/intro.htm}}</ref> The name dracunculiasis is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] "affliction with little dragons"<ref name="Barry">{{cite journal |author=Barry M |title=The tail end of guinea worm — global eradication without a drug or a vaccine |journal=N.

The [[Carter Center]] has predicted that guinea worm disease "will be the first [[parasitic disease]] to be [[disease eradication|eradicated]] and the first disease to be eradicated without the use of [[vaccine]]s or medical treatment".<ref name="GWEP">{{cite web |publisher = [[Carter Center]] |title=Guinea Worm Eradication Program |work= The Carter Center | url = http://www.cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/mini_site/facts.html | accessdate = 2011-03-01}}</ref> 

The primary mode of prevention is through behaviour change, alongside the provision of clean water sources and the treatment of contaminated drinking water with larvicides. There is no animal or environmental [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] of ''D. medinensis'' and thus the parasite must pass through a host each year to survive.<ref name="GWEP"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Dracunculiasis2 DPDx.jpg|thumb|Dracunculiasis can migrate to the foot.]]
As the worm moves downwards, usually to the lower leg, through the [[subcutaneous tissue]]s it leads to intense pain localized to its path of travel. The painful, burning sensation experienced by infected people has led to the disease being called "the fiery serpent". Other symptoms include [[fever]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]].<ref name=WHO2010/>

==Cause and life cycle==
[[File:Drac life cycle.gif|thumb|left|Life cycle of ''Dracunculus medinensis'']]
Guinea worm disease is caused by drinking water contaminated by water fleas (microscopic [[arthropod]]s known as [[copepods]]) that host the Dracunculus larva.<ref name=WHO2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/dracunculiasis/en/ |title=Dracunculiasis | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2010-07-12}}</ref> Guinea worm disease used to thrive in some of the world's poorest areas, particularly those with limited or no access to clean water.<ref name="CDC"/> In these areas, stagnant water sources may still host [[copepod]]s, which can carry the larvae of the guinea worm.

The larvae develop for approximately two weeks inside the copepods. At this stage the larvae can cause guinea worm disease if the infected copepods are not filtered from drinking water.<ref name="TropMed"/> The male guinea worm is typically much smaller ({{convert|12|-|29|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) than the female, which, as an adult, can grow to {{convert|2|-|3|ft|m}} long and be as thick as a [[spaghetti]] noodle.<ref name="TropMed"/><ref name="CDC"/>

Once inside the body, [[stomach acid]] [[digestion|digests]] the water flea, but not the guinea worm larvae that are sheltered inside. These larvae find their way to the body cavity where the female mates with a male guinea worm. This takes place approximately three months after infection. The male worm dies after mating and is absorbed.<ref name="TropMed"/>

The female, which contains larvae, burrows into the deeper [[connective tissue]]s or adjacent to [[long bone]]s or joints of the extremities.<ref name="TropMed"/>

Approximately one year after the infection began, the worm creates a [[blister]] in the human host's skin—usually on the leg or foot.<ref name="MMWR">{{cite journal |title=Progress toward global eradication of dracunculiasis, January 2005-May 2007 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=56 |issue=32 |pages=813–7 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17703170 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5632a1.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Within 72 hours the blister ruptures, exposing one end of the emergent worm. This blister causes a very painful burning sensation as the worm emerges. Infected persons often immerse the affected limb in water to relieve the burning sensation. Once the blister or open sore is submerged in water, the adult female releases hundreds of thousands of guinea worm larvae, contaminating the water supply.

During the next few days, the female worm is capable of releasing more larvae whenever it comes in contact with water as it extends its posterior end through the hole in the host's skin. These larvae contaminate the water supply and are eaten by [[copepod]]s, thereby repeating the life-cycle of the disease. Infected copepods can live in the water for only two to three weeks if they are not ingested by a person. Infection does not create immunity, so people can repeatedly experience guinea worm disease throughout their lives.<ref name="CDC"/>

In drier areas just below the Sahara desert, cases of the disease often emerge during the rainy season, which for many agricultural communities is also the planting or harvesting season. Elsewhere, the emerging worms are more prevalent during the dry season, when ponds and lakes are smaller and copepods are thus more concentrated in them. Guinea worm disease outbreaks can cause serious disruption to local food supplies and school attendance .<ref name="CDC"/>

==Prevention==
[[File:Guinea worm prevention.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sudanese]] boys using pipe filters to prevent guinea worm disease]]
Guinea worm disease can be transmitted only by drinking contaminated water, and can be completely prevented through two relatively simple measures:<ref name=WHO2010/> 

1. Preventing people from drinking [[Cyclops (copepod)|Cyclops]]-contaminated water. The [[Cyclops (copepod)]] (water fleas) can be seen in clear water as swimming white specks.
*Drinking water drawn only from sources that are free from contamination, such as a [[borehole]] or [[water well|wells]].
*[[water filter|Filtering]] drinking water, using a fine-mesh [[cloth filter]] like [[nylon]], to remove the guinea worm-containing crustaceans. Even folding regular cotton cloth over a few times is an effective filter.
*Filtration through ceramic or sand filters
*Boiling
*Developing new sources of drinking water that lack the parasites, or repairing dysfunctional ones.
*Treating water sources with [[larvicide]]s to kill the [[Cyclops (copepod)|Cyclops]]<ref>{{cite pmid | 17954680}}</ref>

2. Preventing people with emerging Guinea worms from entering water sources used for drinking.
*Community-level case detection and containment is key.  This requires staff going door to door looking for cases and a population willing to help and not hide their cases.
*Controlled immersion of emerging worms in buckets of water to reduce the number of larva in the individual worms, followed by discarding the water on dry ground.
*Discouraging all members of the community from setting foot in the drinking water source
*Employing guards at local water sources to prevent people with emerging worms from entering

==Treatment==

There is no vaccine or medicine to treat or prevent Guinea worm disease.<ref name=WHO2010/> Once a Guinea worm begins emerging, the first step is to do a controlled submersion of the affected area in a bucket of water. This causes the worm to discharge many of its larva, making it less infectious. The water is then discarded on the ground far away from any water source. Submersion results in subjective relief of the burning sensation and makes subsequent extraction of the worm easier. To extract the worm, a person must wrap the live worm around a piece of gauze or a stick. The process can be long, taking anywhere from hours to months. Gently massaging the area around the blister can help loosen the worm up a bit.<ref name="GWEP"/> This is nearly the same treatment that is noted in the famous ancient Egyptian medical text, the [[Ebers papyrus]] from [[1550 BC]]<ref name="TropMed"/> Some people have said that extracting a Guinea worm feels like the afflicted area is on fire.<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=World moves closer to eradicating ancient worm disease |date=2007-03-27 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2007/np15/en/index.html |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref><ref name="NYT">{{cite news |title=Dose of Tenacity Wears Down a Horrific Disease |work = [[The New York Times|New York Times]] |date=2006-03-26 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/international/africa/26worm.html |accessdate= 2008-07-15 |last =McNeil | first = DG}}</ref> However, if the infection is identified before an ulcer forms, the worm can also be surgically removed by a trained doctor in a medical facility.<ref name = "CDC">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/dracunculiasis/factsht_dracunculiasis.htm| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] | date =2008-07-15 | accessdate = 2010-07-12 | title = Fact Sheet:Dracunculiasis — Guinea Worm Disease}}</ref>

Although Guinea worm disease is usually not fatal, the wound where the worm emerges could develop a secondary [[bacterial infection]] such as [[tetanus]], which may be life-threatening—a concern in endemic areas where there is typically limited or no access to health care.<ref name="ITFDE">{{cite journal |title=Recommendations of the International Task Force for Disease Eradication |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=42 |issue=RR–16 |pages=1–38 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=8145708 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00025967.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> [[Analgesic]]s can be used to help reduce swelling and pain and [[antibiotic]] ointments can help prevent secondary infections at the wound site.<ref name="CDC"/> At least in the Northern region of Ghana, the Guinea worm team found that antibiotic ointment on the wound site caused the wound to heal too well and too quickly making it more difficult to extract the worm and more likely that pulling would break the worm. The local team preferred to use something called "Tamale oil" (after the regional capital) which lubricated the worm and aided its extraction. As a practical matter, many patients were also given prophylactic oral antibiotics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

It is of great importance not to break the worm when pulling it out. Broken worms have a tendency to putrefy or petrify. Putrefaction leads to the skin sloughing off around the worm. Petrification is a problem if the worm is in a joint or wrapped around a vein or other important area.

Use of [[metronidazole]] or [[thiabendazole]] may make extraction easier, but also may lead to migration to other parts of the body.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|997617|Dracunculiasis: Treatment & Medication|treatment}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
In 1986, there were an estimated 3.5&nbsp;million cases of Guinea worm in 20 endemic nations in Asia and Africa.<ref name="GWEP"/> Ghana alone reported 180,000 cases in 1989. The number of cases has since been reduced by more than 99.98% to 542 in 2012<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/216.pdf</ref> - in the four remaining endemic nations of Africa: [[South Sudan]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]]. This is the lowest number of cases since the eradication campaign began. As of 2010, however, the WHO predicted it will be "a few years yet" before eradication is achieved, on the basis that it took 6–12 years for the countries that have so far eliminated Guinea worm transmission to do so after reporting a similar number of cases to that reported in southern [[Sudan]] (now South Sudan) in 2009.<ref name="WHO_WER_85-19">{{cite journal |author=WHO |title=Dracunculiasis eradication – global surveillance summary, 2009 |journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec |volume=85 |issue=19 |pages=166–175 |date=7 May 2010 |url=http://www.who.int/entity/wer/2010/wer8519.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] }}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] is the international body that certifies whether a disease has been eliminated from a country or eradicated from the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=WHO certifies seven more countries as free of guinea-worm disease |url=http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/guineaworm_press_note/en/index.html |accessdate=2010-05-14 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> The [[Carter Center]] also reports the status of the Guinea worm eradication program by country.<ref name="GWEP Activities">{{cite web |publisher =[[Carter Center]] |title=Activities by Country - Guinea Worm Eradication Program |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/countries/activities_gw.html |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref>

===Certified free===
Endemic countries must report to the International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication and document the absence of [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] cases of Guinea worm disease for at least three consecutive years to be [[certify|certified]] as Guinea worm-free by the World Health Organization.<ref name="ICFDE2">{{cite journal |author=CDC |title=Progress Toward Global Dracunculiasis Eradication, June 2000 |journal=MMWR Morb.

The results of this certification scheme have been remarkable: by 2007, [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Kenya]], [[Mauritania]], [[Togo]], and [[Uganda]] had stopped transmission, and [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic|CAR]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Senegal]], [[Yemen]] were WHO certified.<ref name="GWEP Activities">{{Cite web |author=The Carter Center |title=Activities by Country - Guinea Worm Eradication Program |work= The Carter Center |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/countries/activities_gw.html |accessdate=2010-03-16 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}</ref>

===Endemic===
At the end of 2012, South Sudan, Mali, Ethiopia and Chad still had endemic transmission. The major focus is South Sudan (independent after 2011, formerly the southern region of [[Sudan]]), which reported 96% of all cases in 2012.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/217.pdf</ref>

| Sudan increased its efforts at eradication from 2005 when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, ending a more than two-decade long civil war. 2006 saw an increase to 15,539 cases of Guinea Worm disease, from 5,569 cases in 2005, as a result of reporting from endemic areas that were no longer war-torn. The Southern Sudan Guinea Worm Eradication Program (SSGWEP) has deployed over 28,000 village volunteers, supervisors and other health staff to work on the program full-time. The SSGWEP was able to slash the number of cases reported in 2006 by 63% to 5,815 cases in 2007. Since 2011, at the time that South Sudan became independent, its northern neighbor Sudan had reported no endemic cases of dracunculiasis .<ref name="Hopkins 2008"/>

| In Ghana, after a decade of frustration and stagnation, in 2006 a decisive turnaround was achieved. Multiple changes can be attributed to the improved containment and lower incidence of dracunculiasis: better supervision and accountability, active oversight of patients daily by paid staff, and an intensified public awareness campaign. After Jimmy Carter's visit to Ghana in August 2006, the government of Ghana declared Guinea worm disease to be a public health emergency. The overall rate of contained cases has increased in Ghana from 60% in 2005, to 75% in 2006, 84% in 2007, 85% in 2008, 93% in 2009, and 100% in 2010.<ref name="Wrap-up 202"/><ref name="Hopkins 2008"/><ref name="wrap-up195"/>

===2011===
Ghana appears to have eradicated guinea worm. In August 2011, their public health officials reported that the country was free of reported cases for over 14 months.<ref>http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/west/Ghana-joins-14-other-African-Nations-in-Eradicating-Guinea-Worm-126700018.html</ref> While promising, given the incubation period, it will be some time before the WHO certifies Ghana as free of this disease.

To the end of June 2011 the number of cases were: Chad 2 cases; Ethiopia 6 cases; Mali 3 cases: and South Sudan 806 cases. After the separation of South Sudan from Northern Sudan, the territory of Northern Sudan has been free of guinea worm disease for several years and it has been certified free of this disease by the WHO.

To the end of August 2011 the number of cases reported were: Chad 7 cases; Ethiopia 8 cases; Mali 9 cases: and South Sudan 944 cases. These occurred in a total of 440 villages. One possible case has been reported from India: investigation into this is ongoing. India has been certified free since 2000 and it is suspected that this possible case may be an imported one. The majority of cases (78%) in South Sudan were located in adjacent two counties of the [[Eastern Equatoria]] state: [[Kapoeta East County]] (561 cases) and [[Kapoeta North County]] (146 cases). Aside from 2 cases imported from South Sudan, no cases were reported in Ethiopia in July and August from the single focus ([[Gog District]]) from which all cases in the last few years have been found. Although it is now possible that transmission in Ethiopia has been interrupted official confirmation will not be forthcoming for several months.<ref>http://cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/207.pdf</ref>

Up to September 2011 the number of uncontained cases were: South Sudan - 241; Chad - 6; Mali - 6; Ethiopia - 1. Of the 70 counties in South Sudan, 56 (80%) are considered free of dracunculiasis.

The total number of cases in 2011 was 1060. Of these 1030 were reported from South Sudan. Mali reported 12; Chad reported 10; and Ethiopia 8. The cases in Chad were part of an outbreak that was originally identified in 2010 as part of a pre certification process. Chad had not reported any cases between 2001 and 2009. Two of the cases in Ethiopia were imported from South Sudan.

===2012===
According to the [[WHO]] the number of reported cases of dracunculiasis has continued to drop to 143 cases between 1 January and 30 April 2012 compared with 382 cases during the same period in 2011. South Sudan alone reported 142 cases, or 99% of the global total, and Ethiopia reported 1 case.<ref>http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis/en/</ref>

The July 16 report from the WHO Collaborating Center for Research, Training and Eradication of Dracunculiasis states that the number of reported cases between 1 January and 30 June 2012 has dropped to 391 from 807 cases in the same period in 2011 - a 52% improvement. By country the number of reported cases are South Sudan 387, Ethiopia 2, Mali 1 and Chad 1.  In the same period of 2011 the number of reported cases were South Sudan 794, Ethiopia 8, Mali 3 and Chad 2.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/213.pdf</ref>

The September 12 report from the WHO Collaborating Center for Research, Training and Eradication of Dracunculiasis states that the number of reported cases between 1 January and 31 August 2012 has dropped to 484 from 944 cases in the same period in 2011 - a 49% improvement. By country the number of reported cases are South Sudan 494, Ethiopia 3, Mali 4 and Chad 7. In the same period of 2011 the number of reported cases were South Sudan 944, Ethiopia 6, Mali 9 and Chad 8.  However, since March 2012, Mali’s Guinea Worm Eradication Program workers have had limited access to the rebel–held regions in northern Mali, and are not able to investigate cases there. [[Médecins du Monde]] have reported rumours of a further 5 cases in northern Mali since March, but these have not been confirmed, nor included in the figures.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/214.pdf</ref>

The October 18 report from the WHO Collaborating Center for Research, Training and Eradication of Dracunculiasis states that the number of reported cases between 1 January and 30 September 2012 has dropped to 521 from 1004 cases in the same period in 2011 - a 48% improvement. By country the number of reported cases are South Sudan 502, Ethiopia 3, Mali 7 and Chad 9. In the same period of 2011 the number of reported cases were South Sudan 980, Ethiopia 6, Mali 10 and Chad 8.   Again, Mali’s Guinea Worm Eradication Program workers have limited access to northern Mali, and are not able to investigate or confirm all cases there.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/215.pdf</ref>

The provision figures for all of 2012 are: total 542; South Sudan 521; Chad 10; Mali 7; and Ethiopia 4.  This is a 49% improvement of the total compared to 2011.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/216.pdf</ref>

===2013===
Up to the end of March, six cases have been reported, all in South Sudan, compared to 61 cases in  2012 in the same period - a 90% reduction in cases.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/218.pdf</ref>  The February WHO report goes on to say after recording no new cases in January "This is not the end of Guinea worm disease - there will be cases later in 2013 - but we can see the end from here."<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/217.pdf</ref> The report also compares the 521 cases in South Sudan in 2012 ( out of 542 globally ) with Ghana's 501 cases in 2008, and says it took 18 more months to subsequently eliminate Dracunculiasis from Ghana, with the last case in May 2010.

By 22nd April, three cases have been confirmed in Chad.  After 10 years without any reported cases the reporting of 10 cases in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012 is a very unusual pattern.  There are concerns that surveillance vigilance has decreased, and renewed efforts are being made to increase monitoring.  This includes coordinating monitoring with its neighbors Nigeria and Cameroon.<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/218.pdf</ref>

==History of the eradication program==
The global campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease began at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in 1980. In 1986, former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and his not-for-profit organization, [[Carter Center|The Carter Center]], began leading the global campaign, in conjunction with CDC, [[UNICEF]], and [[WHO]].<ref name="ICFDEmem">{{Cite web |publisher=Carter Center |title=International Task Force for Disease Eradication — Original Members (1989–1992). |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/itfde/original_members.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> At this time India, Pakistan, Yemen and 17 countries in Africa were endemic for this disease and reported a total of 3.5&nbsp;million cases per year.

Carter made a personal visit to a Guinea worm endemic village in 1988. He said: "Encountering those victims first-hand, particularly the teenagers and small children, propelled me and [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]] to step up the Carter Center's efforts to eradicate Guinea worm disease."<ref name="TIME">{{Cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=Jimmy |last2=Lodge |first2=Michelle |title=A Village Woman's Legacy. |journal=[[TIME]] |date=2008-03-31 |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/time_village_womans_legacy_mar31_08.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>

President Carter also recruited two African former heads of state to the battle against Guinea worm disease. Then-former head of state of Mali, General [[Amadou Toumani Toure]] (since elected [[President of Mali]]) has been a strong advocate of Guinea worm eradication in Mali and all other French-speaking African endemic countries since 1992.<ref name="Toure">{{Cite document |author=[[Jimmy Carter]] |title="Remarks of Mr Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States of America, at the World Health Assembly". |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2004/wha57/carter/en/ |date=2004-05-19 |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref><ref name="Toure2">{{Cite web |publisher=Carter Center |first=Carter |title=Mali's President Touré, Southern Sudan Program Director Logora Honored With The Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Award. |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/toure_honored.html |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Since 1999, former [[Nigerian head of state]] General (Dr.) [[Yakubu Gowan]] has played a similar role in Nigeria, which at the eradication campaign's start had more cases than any other country.<ref name="Gowon">{{Cite web |publisher=Carter Center |title=Jimmy Carter and General Dr. Yakubu Gowon Encourage Nigerian Officials to Control Schistosomiasis, Other Diseases. |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/nigeria_021507.html |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>

Since humans are the principal host for Guinea worm, and there is no evidence that ''D. medinensis'' has ever been reintroduced to humans in any formerly endemic country as the result of non-human infections, the disease can be controlled by identifying all cases and modifying human behavior to prevent it from recurring.<ref name="GWEP"/><ref name=BIMI>{{cite journal|last=BIMI|first=L.|coauthors=A.

In 1991, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) agreed that Guinea worm disease should be eradicated.<ref name="ITFDE"/> At this time there were 400,000 cases reported each year. The Carter Center has continued to lead the eradication efforts, primarily through its Guinea Worm Eradication Program.<ref name="GATES">{{Cite web |publisher=Carter Center |title=2006 Gates Award for Global Health: The Carter Center |year=2006 |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/nondatabase/speech_gates.html |accessdate=2010-03-08 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In December 2008, The Carter Center announced new financial support totaling US$55&nbsp;million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom [[Department for International Development]].<ref name="CC2008">{{Cite web |publisher=Carter Center |title=Guinea Worm Cases Hit All-Time Low: Carter Center, WHO, Gates Foundation, and U.K. Government Commit $55 Million Toward Ultimate Eradication Goal |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/gates_120508.html |accessdate=2008-12-08 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}</ref> The funds will help address the higher cost of identifying and reporting the last cases of Guinea worm disease. According to The Carter Center, surveillance of countries, including the smallest communities in the most remote areas, needs to be intensified to prevent outbreaks and setbacks. In the case of Guinea worm disease, which has a one-year incubation period, there is a very high cost of maintaining a broad and sensitive monitoring system and providing a rapid response when necessary.<ref name="CC2008"/>

===Barriers===
The eradication of Guinea worm disease has faced several challenges:
*Inadequate security in some endemic countries
*Lack of political will from the leaders of some of the countries in which the disease is endemic
*The need for change in behavior in the absence of a magic bullet treatment like a vaccine or medication
*Inadequate funding at certain times<ref name="Barry"/>

One of the most significant challenges facing Guinea worm eradication has been the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war in southern Sudan]], which was largely inaccessible to health workers due to violence.<ref name="Barry"/><ref name="Sudan">{{Cite web |publisher=Carter Center |title=Sudan |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/countries/sudan.html |accessdate=2008-07-15 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}</ref>

Public health officials cite the formal end of the war in 2005 as a turning point in Guinea worm eradication because it has allowed health care workers greater access to southern Sudan's endemic areas.<ref name="DHop"/> One remaining area in West Africa outside of Ghana remains challenging to ending Guinea worm: [[northern Mali]], where [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] rebels have made some affected areas unsafe for health workers.

One of the greater challenges in eradicating dracunculiasis has been and will continue to be in South Sudan (formerly southern Sudan), particularly political uncertainty in the country with national elections in 2009 and the referendum on the status of southern Sudan in 2011 resulting in South Sudan's independence. Sporadic insecurity or widespread civil conflict could at any time ignite, thwarting eradication efforts.<ref name="Hopkins 2008">{{cite journal |author=Hopkins DR, Ruiz-Tiben E, Downs P, Withers PC, Roy S |title=Dracunculiasis eradication: neglected no longer |journal=[[Am.

Moreover, residents in these communities are nomadic, moving seasonally with cattle in pursuit of water and pasture, making it very difficult to know where and when transmission occurred. The peak transmission season coincides with the rainy season, hampering travel by public health workers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO |title=Dracunculiasis eradication |journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec |volume=83 |issue=18 |pages=159–167 |date=2 May 2008 |doi= |url=http://www.who.int/entity/wer/2008/wer8318.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |pmid= 18453066 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==
The pain caused by the worm's emergence—which typically occurs during planting and harvesting seasons—prevents many people from working or attending school for as long as three months. In heavily burdened agricultural villages fewer people are able to tend their fields or livestock, resulting in food shortages and lower earnings.<ref name="GWEP"/><ref name="DHop">{{Cite journal |title=Dracunculiasis Eradication: The Final Inch |journal=[[American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=669–675 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/73/4/669 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |author=Donald R.

==History==
Dracunculiasis has been a recognized disease for thousands of years:
* Guinea worm has been found in calcified [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]].<ref name="GWEP"/>
* An [[Old Testament]] description of "fiery serpents" may have been referring to Guinea Worm: "And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died." ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:4–9).<ref name="TropMed"/>
* The 2nd century BC, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] writer [[Agatharchides]], described this affliction as being endemic amongst certain nomads in what is now Sudan and along the Red Sea.<ref name="TropMed"/>
* The traditional (and still current) method of extracting guinea worm by twisting the worm around a stick may have inspired the [[rod of Asclepius]], a symbol of medicine since Ancient Greek times which portrays a snake winding around a staff.<ref>{{cite web |author=Keith Blayney |year=2002 |title=Caduceus vs Staff of Asclepius |accessdate=2009-06-24 |url=http://www.drblayney.com/Asclepius.html}}</ref>
* The unusually high [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of dracunculiasis in the city of [[Medina]] led to it being included in part of the disease's scientific name "medinensis." A similar high incidence along the Guinea coast of West Africa gave the disease its more commonly used name.<ref name="TropMed"/> Guinea worm is no longer endemic in either location.

The Russian scientist [[Aleksej Fedchenko]] (1844 - 1873) during the 1860s while living in [[Samarkand]] was provided with a number of specimens of the worm by a local doctor which he kept in water. While examining the worms Fedchenko noted the presence of water fleas with embryos of the guinea worm within them.

In modern times, the first to describe dracunculiasis and its pathogenesis was the Bulgarian physician [[Hristo Stambolski]], during his exile in [[Yemen]] (1877–1878).<ref>Христо Стамболски: Автобиография, дневници и mспомени. (Autobiography of Hristo Stambolski. Sofia : Dŭržavna pečatnica, 1927–1931)</ref> His theory was that the cause was infected water which people were drinking.
