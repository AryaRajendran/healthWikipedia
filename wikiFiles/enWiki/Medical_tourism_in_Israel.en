'''Medical tourism in Israel''' is a subset of the [[medical tourism]] industry in which patients travel to other countries to have procedures performed at a lower cost. [[Israel]] is emerging as a popular destination for medical tourists.<ref name="Haaretz">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/952294.html Welcoming the world's ills], [[Haaretz]], Feb 8, 2008</ref> In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue.<ref name="Haaretz"/>

==Overview==
Medical tourists come to Israel because surgery and [[IVF|in-vitro fertilization]] treatments cost considerably less than in their home countries.<ref>[http://www.dmedical.org/medicine_israel.html Medicine in Israel]</ref>Israel is the world leader in this procedure.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/world/middleeast/18israel.html?pagewanted=all Where Families Are Prized, Help Is Free]</ref> 
Some seek relief for a variety of medical conditions at treatment centers and spas at the [[Dead Sea]], a world-famous therapeutic resort.<ref name="Haaretz"/> Israel’s facilities are recognized throughout the world, with regular contacts maintained on a reciprocal basis with major medical and scientific research centers abroad. Another factor in choosing Israel is the comfortable climate and scenic locations which have a calming effect on patients. <ref>Health tourism in Israel: A developing industry 
Niv, Amiad (Adi) Tourism Review. Vol. 44, no. 4, pp. 30-32. 1989</ref>

Israel is frequently the host venue for international medical conferences.

==Treatment options==
Patients come to Israel for procedures such as bone marrow transplants, heart surgery and catheterization, oncological and neurological treatments, car accident rehabilitation and more.
Israel has become a major destination for residents of Cyprus in need of bone marrow transplants because the procedure is unavailable in their home country. [[Psoriasis]] patients come to Israel for treatments at the Dead Sea. 

==Lower costs==
A patient with no health insurance who needs bypass surgery in the United States would spend approximately $120,000, while the same procedure performed in Israel would cost approximately $30,000. [[In vitro fertilization]] (IVF) is known for its high success rates and considerably lower costs. IVF costs $3,000-$3,500 in Israel, compared to $16,000-$20,000 in the U.S.


== Dead Sea medical tourism ==

The Dead Sea area has become a major center for [[health]] [[research]] and treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the very low content of [[pollen]]s and other [[allergen]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the reduced [[ultraviolet]] component of [[Sunlight|solar radiation]], and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each have specific [[health effect]]s. For example, persons suffering reduced [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] function from [[disease]]s such as [[cystic fibrosis]] seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadsea-health.org/new_html/diseases_respiratory.html |title=Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease |accessdate=2007-05-22 |work=Dead Sea Research Center}}</ref>

Sufferers of the skin disorder [[psoriasis]] also benefit from the ability to sunbathe for long periods in the area due to its position below sea level and subsequent result that many of the sun's harmful UV rays are reduced.<ref>S. Halevy et al. ''Dead sea bath salt for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris: a double-blind controlled study''. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, Volume 9, Issue 3: 237-242.</ref>

The region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for several types of therapies:
* [[Climatotherapy]]: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as  [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[Sunlight|sunshine]], [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] and special atmospheric constituents.
* [[Light therapy|Heliotherapy]]: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the [[sun|sun's]] radiation.
* [[Thalassotherapy]]: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea [[water]].

Mud from the Dead Sea is believed to have therapeutic benefits for skin disorders and other physical ailments.

==Medical tourism brokers==
The medical tourism industry in Israel has created a need for medical tourism brokers. These agents are something between travel agents and medical coordinators. They facilitate the process of receiving medical care in a foreign country by aiding in everything from the purchase of plane tickets, to the facilitation of the whole medical process. They also specialize in organizing entertainment by offering trips/tours all over Israel. Usually, they earn their pay by receiving a brokerage fee from the doctors and do not cost anything to the patient. If one does not have family or close friends in Israel, this is the easiest way to benefit from medical tourism in Israel.
