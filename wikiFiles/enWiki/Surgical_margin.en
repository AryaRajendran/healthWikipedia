'''Surgical margin''', also known as '''tumor free margin''', '''free margin''', '''normal skin margin''', and '''normal tissue margin''', usually refers to the visible normal tissue or skin margin that is removed with the [[biopsy|surgical excision]] of a [[tumor]], growth, or [[malignancy]].

==Definition==
Surgical margin in a surgery reports define the visible margin or free edge of "normal" tissue seen by the [[surgeon]] with the naked eye.  Surgical margin as read in a [[pathology]] report define the histological measurement of normal or unaffected tissue surrounding the visible [[tumor]] under a [[microscope]] on a glass mounted histology section.<ref>Maloney, ME., et al.  Surgical Dermatopathology.  Blackwell Science, 1999.  pp. 107-121.</ref>  A "narrow" surgical margin implies that the tumor exists very close to the surgical margin, and a "wide" surgical margin implies the tumor exists far from the cut edge or the surgical margin.  Narrow surgical margin using the [[bread loafing]] technique suggests that residual cancer might be left due to [[false negative]] error.  A surgeon often will perform a second surgery if a narrow surgical margin is noted on a pathology report.

==Associated errors and recurrence rate==
This determination is made with the full understanding of "[[false negative]] error" intrinsic in the [[bread loafing]] technique of histology (also known as POMA - a term used by the NCCN).<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://wwwu.tsgh.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/commcpc/images/nccn/Non-Melanoma%20Skin%20Cancer-2007.pdf Tri-Service General Hospital] {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>  The higher is the false negative error, the higher is the recurrence rate of a cancer or tumor at the surgical margin.  This is due to the misreading of a pathology specimen as being clear of residual tumor, when there is actually residual tumor left where the specimen was not cut and mounted on the histology slide.  The "[[false negative]] error" is very low in the [[CCPDMA]] method of histology processing, and can be very high in the [[bread loafing]] (POMA) method of histology processing.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  In the bread loafing method of processing, one will note a high [[false negative]] error rate with narrow surgical margin; and one will note a low [[false negative]] error with a wide surgical margin<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118489417/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Margin Involvement after the Excision of Melanoma In Situ: The Need for Complete En Face Examination of the Surgical Margins - KIMYAI-ASADI - 2007 - Dermatologic Surgery - Wil...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Surgical margin has a much less significant effect on the [[false negative]] error rate of [[CCPDMA]] methods, allowing the surgeon to routinely use very narrow surgical margins (1 to 2&nbsp;mm for non-melanoma skin cancer).<ref name=autogenerated2 />
