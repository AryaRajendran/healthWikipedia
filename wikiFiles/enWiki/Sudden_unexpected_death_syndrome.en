'''Sudden unexpected death syndrome''',  or '''Sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome''' ('''SUNDS'''), or '''Sudden Unknown Death Syndrome''' is sudden unexpected death of adolescents and adults, often during [[sleep]].<ref> Also known as SUDS.

==Causes==
SUNDS has been cloaked in superstition. Filipinos believe ingesting high levels of carbohydrates just before sleeping causes ''bangungot''. 

It has only been recently that the scientific world has begun to understand this syndrome. Victims of ''bangungot'' have not been found to have any organic heart diseases or structural heart problems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

However, cardiac activity during SUNDS episodes indicates irregular heart rhythms and ventricular fibrillation. The victim survives this episode if the heart's rhythm goes back to normal. Older Filipinos recommend wiggling the big toe of people experiencing this to encourage their heart to snap back to normal.<ref name="ramos">{{cite book |last=Ramos |first=Maximo D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology |year=1971 |publisher=University of the Philippines Press |location=Philippines |isbn= }}</ref>

In the Philippines, most cases of ''bangungot'' have been linked with [[acute pancreatitis|acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis]] by Filipino medical personnel although the effect might have been due to changes in the pancreas during [[post-mortem]] [[autolysis]].<ref name="bangungutmanila">{{cite journal|last=Munger|first=Ronald G.|coauthors=Elizabeth A.

==Features==
The condition appears to affect primarily young [[Hmong people|Hmong]] men from [[Laos]] (median age 33)<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.9.1187|journal=Am J Public Health|year=1987|volume=77|issue=9|pages=1187&ndash;90|title=Sudden death in sleep of Laotian-Hmong refugees in Thailand: a case-control study|author=Munger RG}}</ref> and northeastern Thailand (where the population are mainly of Laotian descent).<ref name="Tatsanavivat">{{cite journal|journal=Int J Epidemiol|year=1992|volume=21|issue=5|pages=904&ndash;10|title=Sudden and unexplained deaths in sleep (Laitai) of young men in rural northeastern Thailand|author=Tatsanavivat P, Chiravatkul A, Klungboonkrong V, Chaisiri S, Jarerntanyaruk L, Munger RG, Saowakontha S|pmid=1468851|doi=10.1093/ije/21.5.904}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Int J Epidemiol|year=1993|volume=22|issue=1|pages=81&ndash;7|title=Sudden unexplained death syndrome in north-east Thailand|author=Tungsanga K, Sriboonlue P|pmid=8449651|doi=10.1093/ije/22.1.81}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The only proven way to prevent death is by implantation of a [[defibrillator|cardiovertor defibrillator]].  Oral antiarrhythmics such as [[propranolol]] are ineffective.<ref name="DEBUT">{{cite journal|journal=Circulation|year=2003|volume=107|issue=17|pages=2221&ndash;6|title=Defibrillator Versus beta-Blockers for Unexplained Death in Thailand (DEBUT): a randomized clinical trial|author=Nademanee K, Veerakul G, Mower M, ''et al.''|pmid=12695290|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000066319.56234.C8}}</ref>

==Folk beliefs==
This phenomenon is well known among the Hmong people of Laos,<ref name="Alder1995">{{cite journal|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1995|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1623&ndash;9|title=Refugee stress and folk belief: Hmong sudden deaths|author=Adler SR|pmid=7660175|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)00347-V}}</ref> who ascribe these deaths to a malign spirit, ''dab tsuam'' (pronounced "da cho"), said to take the form of a jealous woman.  Hmong men may even go to sleep dressed as women so as to avoid the attentions of this spirit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

''Bangungot'' is depicted in the Philippines as a mythological creature called [[batibat]]. This [[hag|hag-like]] creature sits on the victim's face or chest so as to immobilize and suffocate him.
