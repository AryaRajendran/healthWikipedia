'''Mark R. Geier''' (born 1948, [[Washington, D.C.]]) is a [[self-employment|self-employed]] [[United States|American]] [[physician]], [[Geneticist]]<ref>http://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/medicaldevices/medicaldevicesadvisorycommittee/dentalproductspanel/ucm236373.pdf</ref> and controversial [[professional witness]] who has testified in more than 90 cases regarding allegations of [[vaccine injury|injury or illness caused by vaccines]].<ref name=Harris>{{cite news |work= New York Times |url=http://nytimes.com/2005/06/25/science/25autism.htm |date=2005-06-25 |title= On autism's cause, it's parents vs. research |author= Harris G, O'Connor A |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Deer"/>

Geier and his son, David Geier, are frequently cited by proponents of the claim that vaccines cause [[autism]].
Geier's credibility as an [[expert witness]] has been questioned in 10 court cases.<ref>http://www.casewatch.org/civil/geier.shtml</ref> In 2003, a judge ruled that Geier presented himself as an expert witness in "areas for which he has no training, expertise and experience."<ref name="Harris"/> In other cases in which Geier has testified, judges have labeled his testimony "intellectually dishonest," "not reliable" and "wholly unqualified."<ref name="Harris"/> Another judge wrote that Geier "may be clever, but he is not credible."<ref name="arizona">{{cite news | title = Critics balk at doctor-son team's claims of autism solution | work = [[Arizona Daily Star]] | publisher = [[McClatchy Newspapers]] | date = May 21, 2009 | accessdate = November 19, 2009 | url = http://azstarnet.com/news/national/article_a10cefb4-1503-5c6b-93c4-899b8de6171b.html}}</ref>

Geier's scientific work has also been criticized; when the [[Institute of Medicine]] reviewed vaccine safety in 2004, it dismissed Geier's work as seriously flawed, "uninterpretable", and marred by incorrect use of scientific terms.<ref name="Harris"/> In 2003, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] criticized one of Geier's studies, which claimed a link between vaccines and autism, as containing "numerous conceptual and scientific flaws, omissions of fact, inaccuracies, and misstatements."<ref  name='AAP_thimerosal'>{{cite web |url=http://aap.org/profed/thimaut-may03.htm  |title= Study fails to show a connection between thimerosal and autism. |author=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2010-08-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030604060812/http://aap.org/profed/thimaut-may03.htm |archivedate = 2003-06-04}}</ref> ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that the [[institutional review board]] which approved some of Geier's experiments with autistic children was located at Geier's business address and included Geier, his son and wife, a business partner of Geier's, and a plaintiff's lawyer involved in vaccine litigation.<ref name="new-scientist">{{cite news | work = [[New Scientist]] | date = June 21, 2007 | accessdate = November 19, 2009 | first = Jim | last = Giles | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426094.200-us-vaccines-on-trial-over-link-to-autism.html?page=1 | title = US vaccines on trial over link to autism}}</ref> In January 2007, a paper by the Geiers was retracted by the journal ''Autoimmunity Reviews''.<ref name=Deer/> Since 2011, Geier's medical license has been suspended or revoked in several states over concerns about his autism treatments.<ref>[https://www.mbp.state.md.us/bpqapp/Orders/D2425004.271.PDF Order for Summary Suspension of License to Practice Medicine], Maryland State Board of Physicians, Retrieved 4 May 2011</ref>

==Career==
Geier while at the Laboratory of General and Comparative Biochemistry, [[National Institutes of Health]] in the 1970s and 1980s was a student researcher from 1969–1970, a research geneticist from 1971–1973, a staff fellow from 1973–1974, on the professional staff from 1974–1978, and a guest worker from 1980-1982. He has been examining vaccine safety issues since then.<ref name=Harris/> He is a Fellow of the [[American College of Medical Genetics]].<ref>{{Cite web

He is currently a self-employed geneticist and along with his son David Geier he operates several organizations from his private address in Maryland, including the Institute for Chronic Illness and the Genetic Centers of America.<ref name=Deer>{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |year=2007 |volume=334 |issue=7595 |pages=666–7 |author= Deer B |title= Autism research: What makes an expert? |doi=10.1136/bmj.39146.498785.BE |pmid=17395945 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7595/666 |pmc=1839225}}</ref> As a professional witness he has testified in more than 90 vaccine cases, in support of the view that there is a clear link between [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal and autism]].<ref name=Harris/>

==Research==

In 1970, while at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], Geier co-authored a paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reporting the first successful [[genetic engineering]] experiment in which [[bacteriophage]] Lambda carrying the [[galactose]] operon corrected the inability of cells in tissue culture from a patient with [[galactosemia]] to metabolise the milk sugar galactose.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Merril CR, Geier MR, Petricciani JC |title=Bacterial virus gene expression in human cells |journal=Nature |volume=233 |issue=5319 |pages=398–400 |year=1971 |pmid=4940436 |doi=10.1038/233398a0}}</ref> This work received a great deal of attention, and the research team was profiled in stories in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'' as a result.<ref name="abc-news">{{cite news | publisher = [[ABC News]] | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3317576&page=1 | title = Researchers Raise Eyebrows With Autism Findings | date = June 26, 2007 | accessdate = November 19, 2009 | first = John | last = Donovan | coauthors = Katie Hinman, Leigh Simons}}</ref>

Geier cowrote the article, "The true story of pertussis vaccination: a sordid legacy?",<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Hist Med Allied Sci |year=2002 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=249–84 |title= The true story of pertussis vaccination: a sordid legacy? |author= Geier D, Geier M |pmid=12211972 |doi= 10.1093/jhmas/57.3.249}}</ref> which won the 2003 Stanley Jackson award for papers published in the ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/jalsci/jacksonprize.html |title= Jackson Prize |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>

Geier has published several speculative articles with his son David Geier, suggesting a relation between [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] exposure during infancy and the onset of [[neurodevelopmental disorders]].<ref name="mh">{{cite journal | author = Geier M, Geier D | title = The potential importance of steroids in the treatment of autistic spectrum disorders and other disorders involving mercury toxicity. | journal = Med Hypotheses | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 946–54 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15780490 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.11.018}}</ref>

==Controversies==
Geier and his son have published several speculative articles about a possible link between [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and TCVs,<ref name="mh"/> generating some controversy.<ref>{{cite news |work=Slate |date=2007-05-28 |accessdate=2008-01-30 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2166939/ |title= Thiomersal on trial: the theory that vaccines cause autism goes to court |author= Allen A}}</ref> The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] dispute the conclusion of the Geiers' paper claiming a correlation between thimerosal and autism, and criticized it for "numerous conceptual and scientific flaws, omissions of fact, inaccuracies, and misstatements".<ref name='AAP_thimerosal' />

===Limited access to Vaccine Safety Datalink records===

The Geiers have been granted access to the Vaccine Safety Datalink records,<ref name="VSD">[http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/rsch/geier.shtml Warning letter re: Dr. Mark Geier.] Casewatch.org.  Retrieved on 2007-11-10.</ref> but the [[National Immunization Program]] found that "during the first visit the researchers conducted unapproved analysis on their datasets and on the second visit attempted to carry out unapproved analyses but did not complete this attempt. This analysis, had it been completed, could have increased the risk of a [[confidentiality]] breach. Before leaving, the researchers renamed files for removal which were not allowed to be removed. Had it gone undetected, this would have constituted a breach of the rules about confidentiality."<ref name="VSD"/>

===Lupron===
The Geiers have developed a protocol for treating autism that uses the drug [[Lupron]]. Mark Geier has called Lupron "the miracle drug" and the Geiers have marketed the protocol across the U.S.<ref name=Tsouderos>{{cite news |author= Tsouderos T |title= 'Miracle drug' called junk science |work= Chicago Tribune |date=2009-05-24 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-lupron-may21,0,242705.story |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> The Geiers filed three U.S. [[patent application]]s on the use of Lupron in combination with [[chelation therapy]] as a treatment protocol for autism based on the hypothesis that "[[testosterone]] mercury" along with low levels of [[glutathione]] blocks the conversion of [[Dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA]] to DHEA-S and therefore raises [[androgens]] which in turn further lower glutathione levels, ultimately providing a connection between autism, mercury exposure, and [[hyperandrogenicity]], specifically [[precocious puberty]].<ref>"[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=geier.IN.&s2=autism.AB.&OS=IN/geier+AND+ABST/autism&RS=IN/geier+AND+ABST/autism Methods of treating autism and autism spectrum disorders]" US [[Patent application]] 20070254314, November 1, 2007</ref><ref name="p1">"[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=2&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=geier.IN.&s2=autism.AB.&OS=IN/geier+AND+ABST/autism&RS=IN/geier+AND+ABST/autism Methods for screening, studying and treating disorders with a component of mercurial toxicity]" US [[Patent application]]20060058271, March 16, 2006</ref><ref name="p2">"[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=geier.IN.&s2=autism.AB.&OS=IN/geier+AND+ABST/autism&RS=IN/geier+AND+ABST/autism Methods of treating disorders having a component of mercury toxicity ]" US [[Patent application]] 20060058241, March 16, 2006</ref>

According to expert pediatric endocrinologists, the Lupron protocol for autism is supported only by junk science.<ref name=Tsouderos/> The reaction of mercury and testosterone which the therapy is intended to treat is actually based on a protocol used to create testosterone crystals for use in X-ray crystallography rather than a physiological process that occurs in the human body.<ref>Offit, Paul.  2008.  Autism's False Prophets, p. 141</ref> Although [[Abbott Laboratories]] sells Lupron in the U.S. and cooperated with the Geiers in one of the patent applications, it is no longer pursuing work with them, citing the nonexistence of scientific evidence to justify further research.<ref>{{cite news |title= Physician team's crusade shows cracks |author= Mills S, Jones T |work= Chicago Tribune |date=2009-05-21 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-lupron-geiers-may21,0,983359.story |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

When treating an autistic child, the Geiers order several dozen lab tests, costing $12,000: if at least one testosterone-related result is abnormal, the Geiers consider Lupron treatments, using 10 times the daily dose ordinarily used to treat precocious puberty. The therapy costs approximately $5,000 per month. The Geiers recommend starting treatment on children as young as possible, and say that some need treatment through adulthood.<ref name=Tsouderos/>

===Expert witness testimony===
Geier has been qualified as an expert witness in Federal Court<ref>United States District Court, Western District of Washington at Seattle in James E. Franics, Plaintiff, v. Maersk Lines, Limited, ''et al.'', Defendants (Case No. C03-2898C)</ref> and has been accepted as an expert witness in approximately 100 hearings for parents seeking compensation from the [[National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]] for alleged vaccine injuries to their children. In 10 of these cases, "Dr. Geier's opinion testimony has either been excluded or accorded little or no weight based upon a determination that he was testifying beyond his expertise."<ref name="ortho">"[http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Jul06/03cv669op.pdf John and Jane Doe v. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc]", US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, July 6, 2006</ref><ref>"[http://www.casewatch.org/civil/geier.shtml Dr. Mark Geier Severely Criticized]", Stephen Barrett, M.D., ''[[Casewatch.org]]''</ref>

=== Medical licenses revoked ===

On April 27, 2011, the [[Maryland]] State Board of Physicians suspended Mark Geier's medical license as an "emergency action", saying he "endangers autistic children and exploits their parents by administering to the children a treatment protocol that has a known substantial risk of serious harm and which is neither consistent with evidence-based medicine nor generally accepted in the relevant scientific community."<ref>[https://www.mbp.state.md.us/bpqapp/Orders/D2425004.271.PDF court order]</ref>  The board ruled that Geier misdiagnosed patients, diagnosed patients without sufficient tests, and recommended risky treatments without fully explaining the risks to the parents.  They also ruled that he misrepresented his credentials, including during an interview with the board.  Geier's lawyer, Joseph A. Schwartz III said the basis of the complaint was a "bona fide dispute over therapy", and hoped for a fair hearing to challenge the board's accusations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chibrknews-maryland-suspends-license-of-autism-doctor-20110504,0,2545323.story |title=Trib Update: Md. suspends autism doctor's license - chicagotribune.com |first=Steve |last=Mills |first2=Patricia |last2=Callahan |work=chicagotribune.com |year=2011 [last update] |quote=bona fide dispute over therapy |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, his son David Geier was charged by the Maryland State Board of Physicians of practicing as a licensed physician, when he only has a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in biology,<ref>[http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/geier/d_geier_charges.pdf Charges Under the Maryland Medical Practices Act], Maryland State Board of Physicians, p. 2, point #1 of chapter "Allegations of Fact"</ref> and was fined $10,000 in July 2012.<ref name=davidg/>
