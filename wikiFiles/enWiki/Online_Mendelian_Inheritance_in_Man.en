'''Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man''' ('''OMIM''') is a [[database]] that catalogues all the known [[disease]]s with a [[genetic disorder|genetic component]], and — when possible — links them to the relevant [[genes]] in the [[human genome]] and provides references for further research and tools for genomic analysis of a catalogued gene.<ref name="Hamosh">{{cite pmid|15608251}}</ref>  OMIM is one of the databases housed in the U.S. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI) and included in its search menus.<ref name="urlNational Center for Biotechnology Information">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ |title=National Center for Biotechnology Information |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref>

== Collection process and use ==
The information in OMIM was collected and processed from its inception under the leadership of Dr. [[Victor A. McKusick]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], assisted by a team of [[science]] writers and editors. Relevant articles are identified, discussed and written up in the relevant entries in the MIM database.

The database has been used as a resource for locating literature relevant to inherited conditions.<ref>{{cite pmid|8911353}}</ref>

== The MIM code ==
Every disease and [[gene]] is assigned a six digit number of which the first number classifies the method of inheritance.

If the initial digit is 1, the trait is deemed [[autosomal dominant]]; if 2, [[autosomal recessive]]; if 3, [[X-linked]]. Wherever a trait defined in this dictionary has a MIM number, the number from the 12th edition of MIM, is given in square brackets with or without an asterisk (asterisks indicate that the mode of inheritance is known; a number symbol (#) before an entry number means that the phenotype can be caused by mutation in any of two or more genes) as appropriate e.g., [[Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease]] [MIM #312080] is an X-linked recessive disorder.

* 300000–399999: [[X-linked]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or [[phenotypes]]
* 400000–499999: [[Y-linked]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or [[phenotypes]]
* 500000–599999: [[Mitochondria]]l [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or [[phenotypes]]
* 600000–above : [[Autosomal]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or [[phenotypes]] (created after May 15, 1994)

These codes have been used in the medical literature to provide a unified index to genetic diseases.<ref>{{cite pmid|8592332}}</ref>
