This is a list of notable people who have, or had, the medical condition [[epilepsy]]. Following from that, there is a short list of people who have received a speculative, [[retrospective diagnosis]] of epilepsy. Finally there is a substantial list of people who are often wrongly believed to have had epilepsy.</onlyinclude>

A possible link between epilepsy and greatness has fascinated biographers and physicians for centuries. In his ''Treatise on Epilepsy'', the French 17th century physician Jean Taxil refers to [[Aristotle]]'s "famous epileptics". This list includes [[Hercules]], [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], [[Bellerophon]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Empedocles]], Maracus of Syracuse, and the [[Sibyl]]s.<ref name="Taxil">{{cite web

| '''[[Edward Lear]]'''
| 1812–1888
| An artist, illustrator and writer known for his nonsensical poetry and limericks. His epilepsy, which he developed as a child, may have been inherited (his elder sister Jane had frequent seizures and died young). Lear was ashamed of his epilepsy and kept it a secret. He did, however, record each seizure in his diary.

| '''[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'''
| 1821–1881
| A Russian writer whose epilepsy was probably inherited (both his father and his son had seizures). He incorporated his experiences into his novels &ndash; creating four different characters with epilepsy. Dostoyevsky's epilepsy was unusual in that he claimed to experience an ecstatic [[aura (symptom)|aura]] prior to a seizure, whereas most people experience unpleasant feelings.

==Misdiagnosis==

Many famous people are incorrectly recorded as having epilepsy. In some cases there is no evidence at all for a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In others, the symptoms have been misinterpreted.

===Similar conditions===

There are many conditions that produce [[paroxysm]]al attacks or events. These events (especially in historical, non-medical literature such as biographies) are often called fits, seizures or convulsions. Those terms are not exclusive to epilepsy and such events are sometimes categorised as [[non-epileptic seizures]]. When studied in detail, the attacks were more fully described as "fits of spleen", "seized by pain", "convulsed with anguish", etc.

| '''[[Gustave Flaubert]]'''
| 1821–1880
| In 1984, [[Henri Gastaut]] proposed a very specific retrospective diagnosis of a particular form of complex partial epilepsy. More recent biographical information led John Hughes, in 2005, to conclude that Flaubert had psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, and migraine.

| '''[[Vincent van Gogh]]'''
| 1853–1890
| Over 150 physicians have produced nearly 30 different diagnoses for [[Vincent van Gogh's medical condition|van Gogh's illness]]. [[Henri Gastaut]]'s posthumous diagnosis was "temporal lobe epilepsy precipitated by the use of absinthe in the presence of an early limbic lesion". This agrees with that of van Gogh's own doctor, Felix Rey, who prescribed [[potassium bromide]]. That van Gogh's personality closely matches the [[Geschwind syndrome]] is seen as further evidence by some. Not everyone agrees – a recent review by John Hughes concluded that van Gogh did not have epilepsy. He certainly was mentally ill at times and had "fainting fits" after heavy drinking.

| 1904–1991
| Greene was diagnosed with epilepsy as a young man, after several episodes of loss of consciousness. His impending marriage was at risk and he considered suicide. Treatment consisted of good walks and Kepler's Malt Extract. Greene eventually distrusted the diagnosis and it is now considered likely that the episodes were fainting spells.
