The '''lateral ventricles''' are part of the [[ventricular system]] of the [[brain]]. Classified as part of the [[telencephalon]], they are the largest of the ventricles. 

The lateral ventricles connect to the central [[third ventricle]] through the [[Interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|interventricular foramen of Monro]].

== Clinical significance ==
The volume of the lateral ventricles are known to increase with age. They are also enlarged in a number of neurological conditions and are on average larger in patients with [[schizophrenia]],<ref name="pmid10618008">{{cite journal |author=Wright IC, Rabe-Hesketh S, Woodruff PW, David AS, Murray RM, Bullmore ET |title=Meta-analysis of regional brain volumes in schizophrenia |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10618008 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10618008}}</ref> [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>Kempton, M.J., Geddes, J.R, Ettinger, U. et al.

== Divisions ==
Each lateral ventricle has three horns:
* the ''anterior'' or ''frontal'' horn extends into the [[frontal lobe]]
* the ''posterior'' or [[posterior horn of lateral ventricle|''occipital'' horn]] into the [[occipital lobe]]
* the ''inferior'' or ''temporal'' horn into the [[temporal lobe]]

The body of the lateral ventricle is the central portion, just posterior to the frontal horn. The trigone of the lateral ventricle is a triangular area defined by the temporal horn inferiorly, the occipital horn posteriorly, and the body of the lateral ventricle anteriorly. The cella media is the central part of the lateral ventricle. [[Ependyma]] cover the inside of the lateral ventricles and are [[epithelial cells]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Neuroanatomy|last= Crossman |first= A R|authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Elsevier|location= |isbn=978-0-443-10036-9 |page=32 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Development ==
The lateral ventricles, similarly to other parts of the ventricular system of the brain, develop from the central canal of the neural tube. Specifically, the lateral ventricles originate from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing prosencephalon, and subsequently in the developing telencephalon.<ref>

If its production is bigger than reabsorption or its circulation is blocked- the enlargement of the ventricles may appear and cause a [[hydrocephalus]].
