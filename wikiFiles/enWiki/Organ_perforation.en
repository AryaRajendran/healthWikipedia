'''Organ perforation''' is a complete penetration of the wall of a [[hollow organ]] in the body, such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]] in the case of [[gastrointestinal perforation]]. It mainly refers to accidental or pathologic perforation, rather than intentional penetration during surgery.

Types include [[Gastrointestinal perforation]] and [[Uterine perforation]].
