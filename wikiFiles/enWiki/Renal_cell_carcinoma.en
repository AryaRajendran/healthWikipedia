'''Renal cell carcinoma''' ('''RCC''', also known as '''hypernephroma''') is a [[kidney cancer]] that originates in the lining of the [[Proximal tubule|proximal convoluted tubule]], the very small tubes in the kidney that transport GF (glomerular filtrate) from the glomerulus to the descending limb of the nephron. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 80% of cases.<ref name="m">{{cite journal |author=Mulders PF, Brouwers AH, Hulsbergen-van der Kaa CA, van Lin EN, Osanto S, de Mulder PH |title=[Guideline 'Renal cell carcinoma'] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=152 |issue=7 |pages=376–80 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18380384 |doi=}}</ref> It is also known to be the most lethal of all the genitourinary tumors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramana|first=Jayashree|title=RCDB: Renal Cancer Gene Database|journal=BMC Research Notes|year=2012|volume=5|issue=1|pages=246|doi=10.1186/1756-0500-5-246}}</ref> Initial treatment is most commonly a radical or partial [[nephrectomy]] and remains the mainstay of curative treatment.<ref name="r">{{cite journal |author=Rini BI, Rathmell WK, Godley P |title=Renal cell carcinoma |journal=Curr Opin Oncol |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=300–6 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18391630 |doi=10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f9782b}}</ref> Where the tumor is confined to the renal parenchyma, the 5-year survival rate is 60-70%, but this is lowered considerably where [[metastases]] have spread.

== History ==
Daniel Sennert made the first reference suggesting a [[tumour]] arising in the [[kidney]] in his text ''Practicae Medicinae'', first published in 1613.<ref name=history>{{cite journal|last=Delahunt|first=Brett|title=History of Renal Neoplasia|journal=United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology 2009 Annual Meeting|date=March 8, 2009|url=http://www.uscap.org/site~/98th/pdf/companion09h02.pdf}}</ref> 

Miril published the earliest unequivocal case of renal [[carcinoma]] in 1810.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Delahunt|first=Brett|coauthors=Thornton A|title=Renal cell carcinoma. A historical perspective|journal=J Urol Pathol|year=1996|volume=4|pages=31–49}}</ref> He described the case of Françoise Levelly, a 35 year old woman, who presented to Brest Civic Hospital on April 6, 1809, supposedly in the late stages of pregnancy.<ref name=history />

Koenig published the first classification of renal tumours based on macroscopic morphology in 1826. Koenig divided the tumors into scirrhous, steatomatous, fungoid and medullary forms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Delahunt|first=Brett|coauthors=Eble JN|title=History of the Development of the classification of renal cell neoplasia|journal=Clin Lab Med|year=2005|volume=25|pages=231–246|doi=10.1016/j.cll.2005.01.007|pmid=15848734|issue=2}}</ref>

=== The Hypernephroma Controversy ===

Following the classification of the tumour, researchers attempted to identify the tissue of origin for renal carcinoma. 

The [[pathogenesis]] of renal epithelial tumours has provided one of the most enduring controversies of modern surgical pathology. The debate was initiated by [[Paul Grawitz]] when in 1883, he published his observations on the morphology of small, yellow renal [[tumors|tumours]]. [[Paul Grawitz|Grawitz]] concluded that only alveolar tumours were of [[adrenal]] origin, whereas papillary tumours were derived from [[renal]] tissue.<ref name=history />

In 1893, Paul Sudeck challenged the theory postulated by [[Paul Grawitz|Grawitz]] by publishing descriptions of renal tumours in which he identified atypical features within [[Renal_tubules#Renal_tubule|renal tubules]] and noted a gradation of these atypical features between the tubules and neighboring [[malignant tumour]]. In 1894, [[Otto Lubarsch]], who supported the theory postulated by [[Paul Grawitz|Grawitz]] coined the term ''hypernephroid tumor'', which was amended to ''hypernephroma'' by [[Felix Victor Birch-Hirschfeld]] to describe these tumours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=JUDD|first=E. STARR|coauthors=JOHN R. HAND|title=CARCINOMA OF THE RENAL CORTEX WITH FACTORS BEARING ON PROGNOSIS|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=1 November 1929|volume=44|issue=5|pages=746–771|doi=10.1001/archinte.1929.00140050123011}}</ref>  

Vigorous criticism of Grawitz was provided by Oskar Stoerk in 1908, who considered the [[adrenal]] origin of renal tumours to be unproved. Despite the compelling arguments against the theory postulated by Grawitz, the term hypernephroma, with its associated adrenal connotation, persisted in the literature.<ref name=history /> 

Foot and Humphreys, and Foote et al. introduced the term ''Renal Celled Carcinoma'' to emphasize a [[Renal_tubular#Renal_tubule|renal tubular]] origin for these [[tumors|tumours]]. Their designation was slightly altered by Fetter to the now widely accepted term ''Renal Cell Carcinoma''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=FOOT|first=NC|coauthors=HUMPHREYS, GA; WHITMORE, WF|title=Renal tumors: pathology and prognosis in 295 cases|journal=The Journal of urology|year=1951|volume=66|issue=2|pages=190–200|pmid=14861941}}</ref> 

Convincing evidence to settle the debate was offered by Oberling et al. in 1959 who studied the [[ultrastructure]] of clear cells from eight renal [[carcinomas]]. They found that the tumour cell [[cytoplasm]] contained numerous [[mitochondria]] and deposits of [[glycogen]] and fat. They identified [[cytoplasmic membrane]]s inserted perpendicularly onto [[basement membrane]] with occasional cells containing [[microvilli]] along the free borders. They concluded that these features indicated that the tumours arose from the [[epithelial]] cells of the [[Renal tubule|renal convoluted tubule]], thus finally settling one of the most debated issues in [[tumour]] pathology.<ref name=history /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Oberling|first=C|coauthors=Riviėre M, Haguenan F|title=Ultrastructure of the clear cells in renal carcinomas and its importance for the determination of their renal origin|journal=Nature|year=1960|volume=168|pages=402–403|doi=10.1038/186402a0|issue=4722}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==

Historically medical practitioners would expect a person to present with what is known as the classic triad of symptoms.<ref name="cohen">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Herbert T.|coauthors=McGovern, Francis J.|title=Renal-Cell Carcinoma|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=8 December 2005|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2477–2490|doi=10.1056/NEJMra043172|pmid=16339096}}</ref>  This triad of symptoms includes: 1 [[hematuria]] which is when there is blood present in the urine. 2 Flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs. 3 An abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger. It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10-15% of cases, and can be indicative of the Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in an advanced stage.<ref name="cohen" /> Today RCC is fairly asymptomatic (meaning little to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.<ref name ="motzer">{{cite journal|last=Motzer|first=Robert J.|coauthors=Bander, Neil H.; Nanus, David M.|title=Renal-Cell Carcinoma|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=19 September 1996|volume=335|issue=12|pages=865–875|doi=10.1056/NEJM199609193351207|pmid=8778606}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
The Epidemiology of RCC is complex. It is known that the incidence of the disease varies according to geographic, demographic and, to a lesser extent, hereditary factors. There are some known risk factors, however the significance of other potential risk factors remains more controversial. The incidence of the cancer has been increasing in frequency worldwide at a rate of approximately 2-3% per decade<ref name="DoictrvMissing">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2007.12.001|title=Epidemiologic and socioeconomic burden of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC): A literature review|year=2008|last1=Gupta|first1=Kiran|last2=Miller|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Li|first3=Jim Z.|last4=Russell|first4=Mason W.|last5=Charbonneau|first5=Claudie|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=34|issue=3|pages=193–205|pmid=18313224}}</ref> until the last few years where the number of new cases has stabilised.<ref name="sciencedirect">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.049|title=The Epidemiology of Renal Cell Carcinoma|year=2011|last1=Ljungberg|first1=Börje|last2=Campbell|first2=Steven C.|last3=Cho|first3=Han Yong|last4=Jacqmin|first4=Didier|last5=Lee|first5=Jung Eun|last6=Weikert|first6=Steffen|last7=Kiemeney|first7=Lambertus A.|journal=European Urology|volume=60|issue=4|pages=615–21|pmid=21741761}}</ref>

Occupational exposure to some chemicals such as asbestos, cadmium, lead, chlorinated solvents, petrochemicals and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has been examined by multiple studies with inconclusive results.<ref name="sciencedirect" /><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410x.2000.00708.x|title=Risk factors for adult renal cell carcinoma: A systematic review and implications for prevention|year=2007|last1=Dhôte|first1=R.|last2=Pellicer-Coeuret|first2=M.|last3=Thiounn|first3=N.|last4=Debré|first4=B.|last5=Vidal-Trecan|first5=G.|journal=BJU International|volume=86|pages=20–7|pmid=10886077|issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/oem.2010.056341|title=Occupational exposure to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel, and renal cell carcinoma: A case-control study from Central and Eastern Europe|year=2011|last1=Boffetta|first1=P.|last2=Fontana|first2=L.|last3=Stewart|first3=P.|last4=Zaridze|first4=D.|last5=Szeszenia-Dabrowska|first5=N.|last6=Janout|first6=V.|last7=Bencko|first7=V.|last8=Foretova|first8=L.|last9=Jinga|first9=V.|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=68|issue=10|pages=723–8|pmid=21217163}}</ref> 
Another suspected risk factor is the long term use of non-aspirin anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.356|title=Prospective Evaluation of Analgesic Use and Risk of Renal Cell Cancer|year=2011|last1=Cho|first1=Eunyoung|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=171|issue=16|pages=1487–93|pmid=21911634|last2=Curhan|first2=G|last3=Hankinson|first3=SE|last4=Kantoff|first4=P|last5=Atkins|first5=MB|last6=Stampfer|first6=M|last7=Choueiri|first7=TK}}</ref> 

Finally, studies have found that women who have had a hysterectomy are at more then double the risk of developing RCC than those who have not.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ijc.23750|title=Reproductive, menstrual, and other hormone-related factors and risk of renal cell cancer|year=2008|last1=Zucchetto|first1=Antonella|last2=Talamini|first2=Renato|last3=Dal Maso|first3=Luigino|last4=Negri|first4=Eva|last5=Polesel|first5=Jerry|last6=Ramazzotti|first6=Valerio|last7=Montella|first7=Maurizio|last8=Canzonieri|first8=Vincenzo|last9=Serraino|first9=Diego|journal=International Journal of Cancer|volume=123|issue=9|pages=2213}}</ref> The reason for this remains unclear

== Diagnosis ==
An accurate diagnosis may be difficult to establish given that the early stages of renal cancer are asymptomatic. [[Renal]] [[Tumor|tumours]] are often discovered incidentally on radiologic imaging performed for an unrelated reason. Renal cancers are graded on a scale of 1 to 4, based upon the [[TNM]] criterion. The prevalence of various radiological imaging procedures such as [[intravenous pyelography]] (IVP), [[ultrasonography]], or [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanning have revolutionised the way abnormal renal masses are detected for early stage renal cancer in patients who are asymptomatic.

The first steps taken in order to diagnose this condition are observing any of the signs and symptoms, and an [[anamnesis]] (the detailed medical review of past health state) to evaluate any risk factors. Based on the symptoms presented, a range of [[biochemical]] tests (using blood and/or urine samples) are generally also considered as part of screening process to provide sufficient quantitative analysis of any differences in [[electrolytes]], renal and liver function, and blood clotting times.<ref name=Rini /> Upon physical examination, palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or an organ enlargement.<ref name=Tjaden>{{cite journal|last=Tjaden|first=C|coauthors=Werner, J; Buechler, MW; Hackert, T|title=Reactive hypertrophy of an accessory spleen mimicking tumour recurrence of metastatic renal cell carcinoma|journal=Asian journal of surgery / Asian Surgical Association|date=2011 Jan|year=2011|volume=34|issue=1|pages=50–2|pmid=21515214|doi=10.1016/S1015-9584(11)60019-5}}</ref>  

Although this disease lacks characterisation in the early stages of tumour development, considerations based on diverse clinical manifestations, as well as resistance to [[radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]] are important. The main diagnostic tools for detecting renal cell carcinoma are [[ultrasound]], [[Computed Tomography]] (CT) scanning and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) of the kidneys.<ref name=agabegi2nd>{{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Tumour staging (using the [[TNM staging system]]) of RCC are determined mainly with CT. If the ultrasound shows a mass or [[cyst]], a subsequent CT or MRI with [[intravenous]] contrast is the optimal test for diagnosis and staging.

=== Laboratory Tests ===
Laboratory tests are generally conducted when the patient presents signs and symptoms that may be characteristic of kidney impairment. They are not primarily used to diagnose kidney cancer, due to its [[asymptomatic]] nature and are generally found incidentally during tests for other illnesses such as [[gallbladder]] disease.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Laura S.|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma|journal=Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing|date=30 November 2009|volume=13|issue=0|pages=3–7|doi=10.1188/09.CJON.S2.3-7}}</ref>  In other words, these cancers are not detected usually because they do not cause pain or discomfort when they are discovered. Laboratory analysis can provide an assessment on the overall health of the patient and can provide information in determining the staging and degree of [[metastasis]] to other parts of the body (if a renal [[lesion]] has been identified) before treatment is given.

==== Urinalysis (Urine analysis)====
The presence of blood in urine is a common presumptive sign of renal cell carcinoma. The [[haemoglobin]] of the blood causes the urine to be rusty, brown or red in colour. Alternatively, [[urinalysis]] can test for [[sugar]], [[protein]] and [[bacteria]] which can also serve as indicators for [[cancer]]. A complete blood cell count can also provide additional information regarding the severity and spreading of the [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonn|first=Dorothy|title=Urine test for renal-cell carcinoma|journal=The Lancet Oncology|date=31 Jan|year=2004|volume=5|issue=2|pages=72|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(04)01368-3|pmid=14974475}}</ref>

==== Complete Blood Cell (CBC) count with differential ====
The CBC test provides a quantified measure of the different cells in the whole blood sample from the patient. Such cells examined for in this test include red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]), white blood cells ([[leukocytes]]) and [[platelets]] ([[thrombocytes]]). A common sign of renal cell carcinoma is [[anaemia]] whereby the patient exhibits deficiency in red blood cells.<ref name=Johann>{{cite journal|last=Johann DJ|first=Jr|coauthors=Wei, BR; Prieto, DA; Chan, KC; Ye, X; Valera, VA; Simpson, RM; Rudnick, PA; Xiao, Z; Issaq, HJ; Linehan, WM; Stein, SE; Veenstra, TD; Blonder, J|title=Combined blood/tissue analysis for cancer biomarker discovery: application to renal cell carcinoma|journal=Analytical chemistry|date=Mar 1|year=2010|volume=82|issue=5|pages=1584–8|pmid=20121140|doi=10.1021/ac902204k|pmc=3251958}}</ref> CBC tests are vital as a screening tool for examination the health of patient prior to surgery. Inconsistencies with platelet counts are also common amongst these cancer patients and further coagulation tests, including [[Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate]] (ESR), Prothrombin Time (PT), [[Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time]] (APTT) should be considered.

==== Blood Chemistry Tests ====
Blood chemistry tests are conducted if renal cell carcinoma is suspected as [[cancer]] has the potential to elevate levels of particular chemicals in blood. For example, liver [[enzymes]] such as [[aspartate aminotransferase]] [AST] and [[alanine aminotransferase]] [ALT] are found to be at abnormally high levels.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hatzaras|first=I|coauthors=Gleisner, AL; Pulitano, C; Sandroussi, C; Hirose, K; Hyder, O; Wolfgang, CL; Aldrighetti, L; Crawford, M; Choti, MA; Pawlik, TM|title=A multi-institution analysis of outcomes of liver-directed surgery for metastatic renal cell cancer|journal=HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association|date=Aug|year=2010|volume=14|issue=8|pages=532–8|pmid=22762401|doi=10.1111/j.1477-2574.2012.00495.x|pmc=3406350}}</ref> The staging of the cancer can also be determined by abnormal elevated levels of calcium, which suggests that the cancer may have metastasised to the bones.<ref name=Motzer>{{cite journal|last=Motzer|first=RJ|title=Renal cell carcinoma: a priority malignancy for development and study of novel therapies|journal=Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology|date=Apr 1|year=2003|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1193–4|pmid=12663704|doi=10.1200/JCO.2003.12.072}}</ref> In this case, a doctor should be prompted for a CT scan. Blood chemistry tests also assess the overall function of the kidneys and can allow the doctor to decide upon further radiological tests.

=== Radiology ===
The characteristic appearance of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a solid renal lesion which disturbs the renal contour. It will frequently have an irregular or lobulated margin and may be seen as a lump on the lower pelvic or abdomen region. Traditionally, 85 to 90% of solid renal masses will turn out to be RCC but [[cystic]] renal mass mass may also be due to RCC.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sahni|first=V.A.|title=REVIEW: Biopsy of renal masses: when and why|journal=Cancer Imaging|date=1 January 2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=44–55|doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2009.0005}}</ref> However, the advances of diagnostic modalities are able to incidentally diagnose a great proportion of patients with renal lesions that may appear to be small in size and of benign state. Ten percent of RCC will contain [[calcification]]s, and some contain [[macroscopic]] fat (likely due to invasion and encasement of the perirenal fat.<ref name=Nakada>{{cite journal|last=Nakada|first=G|coauthors=Machida, T; Masuda, F; Onishi, T; Yamazaki, H; Kiyota, H; Suzuki, M; Goto, H|title=[A case of arteriovenous fistulae secondary to renal cell carcinoma accompanied by congestive heart failure]|journal=Hinyokika kiyo. Acta urologica Japonica|date=Aug|year=1983|volume=29|issue=8|pages=901–5|pmid=6675440}}</ref> 
Deciding on the [[benign]] or [[malignant]] nature of the renal mass on the basis of its localised size is an issue as renal cell carcinoma may also be [[cystic]]. As there are several benign cystic renal lesions (simple renal cyst, [[hemorrhage|haemorrhagic]] renal cyst, [[multilocular cystic nephroma]], [[polycystic kidney disease]]), it may occasionally be difficult for the radiologist to differentiate a [[benign]] cystic lesion from a malignant one.<ref name=Pattamapaspong>{{cite journal|last=Pattamapaspong|first=N|coauthors=Muttarak, M; Sivasomboon, C|title=Tuberculosis arthritis and tenosynovitis|journal=Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology|date=Nov|year=2011|volume=15|issue=5|pages=459–69|pmid=22081281|doi=10.1055/s-0031-1293492}}</ref>  The Bosniak classification system for cystic renal [[lesions]] that classifies them based specific imaging features into groups that are [[benign]] and those that need [[surgical resection]] is available.<ref name=Israel>{{cite journal|last=Israel|first=GM|coauthors=Bosniak, MA|title=How I do it: evaluating renal masses|journal=Radiology|date=Aug|year=2005|volume=236|issue=2|pages=441–50|pmid=16040900|doi=10.1148/radiol.2362040218}}</ref> 

The main imaging tests performed in order to identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (ultrasonography), MRI scan, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography.<ref name=Jubelirer>{{cite journal|last=Jubelirer|first=SJ|coauthors=Rubin, M|title=The use of modern radiologic methods in identifying incidental renal cell carcinoma|journal=The West Virginia medical journal|date=Jan|year=1993|volume=89|issue=1|pages=21–3|pmid=8421912}}</ref> Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as excretory [[urography]], [[positron-emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, [[ultrasonography]], [[arteriography]], [[venography]], and bone scanning can also used to aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.

==== Computed Tomography Scanning ====
Contrast-enhanced [[Computed Tomography]] (CT) scanning is a routinely used imaging procedure in determining the stage of the renal cell carcinoma in the [[abdominal]] and [[pelvic]] regions of the patient. CT scans have the potential to distinguish solid masses from cystic masses and may provide information on the localisation, stage or spread of the cancer to other organs of the patient. Key parts of the human body which are examined for [[metastatic]] involvement of renal cell carcinoma may include the [[renal vein]], [[lymph node]] and the involvement of the [[inferior vena cava]].<ref name=Beck>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=AD|title=Renal cell carcinoma involving the inferior vena cava: radiologic evaluation and surgical management|journal=The Journal of urology|date=Oct|year=1997|volume=118|issue=4|pages=533–7|pmid=916043}}</ref>  According to a study conducted by Sauk et al, multidetector CT imaging characteristics have applications in diagnosing patients with clear renal cell carcinoma by depicting the differences of these cells at the cytogenic level.<ref name=Sauk>{{cite journal|last=Sauk|first=SC|coauthors=Hsu, MS; Margolis, DJ; Lu, DS; Rao, NP; Belldegrun, AS; Pantuck, AJ; Raman, SS|title=Clear cell renal cell carcinoma: multiphasic multidetector CT imaging features help predict genetic karyotypes|journal=Radiology|date=Dec|year=2011|volume=261|issue=3|pages=854–62|pmid=22025734|doi=10.1148/radiol.11101508}}</ref>

==== Ultrasound or Ultrasonography ====
Ultrasonographic examination can be useful in evaluating questionable [[asymptomatic]] kidney [[tumours]] and cystic renal [[lesions]] if [[Computed Tomography]] imaging is inconclusive. This radiologic procedure is a safe and non-invasive which uses high frequency sound waves to generate an interior image of the body on a computer monitor. The image generated by the [[ultrasound]] can help diagnose renal cell carcinoma based on the differences of sound reflections on the surface of organs and the abnormal tissue masses. Essentially, ultrasound tests can determine whether the composition of the kidney mass is mainly solid or filled with fluid.<ref name="Jubelirer" />

[[Percutaneous biopsy]] can be performed by a radiologist using ultrasound or computed tomography to guide sampling of the tumour for the purpose of diagnosis by [[pathology]]. However this is not routinely performed because when the typical imaging features of renal cell carcinoma are present, the possibility of an incorrectly negative result together with the risk of a medical complication to the patient may make it unfavourable from a risk-benefit perspective.<ref name=Lane>{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=BR|coauthors=Samplaski, MK; Herts, BR; Zhou, M; Novick, AC; Campbell, SC|title=Renal mass biopsy--a renaissance?|journal=The Journal of urology|date=Jan|year=2008|volume=179|issue=1|pages=20–7|pmid=17997455|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2007.08.124}}</ref>  However, biopsy tests for molecular analysis to distinguish benign from malignant renal tumours is of investigative interest.<ref name="Lane" />

==== Magnetic Resonance Imaging ====
[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) scans provide an image of the soft tissues in the body using radio waves and strong magnets. MRI can be used in replacement of CT if the patient exhibits an allergy to the contrast media cannot be administered.<ref name=Hricak>{{cite journal|last=Hricak|first=H|coauthors=Demas, BE; Williams, RD; McNamara, MT; Hedgcock, MW; Amparo, EG; Tanagho, EA|title=Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and staging of renal and perirenal neoplasms|journal=Radiology|date=Mar|year=1985|volume=154|issue=3|pages=709–15|pmid=3969475}}</ref><ref name=Janus>{{cite journal|last=Janus|first=CL|coauthors=Mendelson, DS|title=Comparison of MRI and CT for study of renal and perirenal masses|journal=Critical reviews in diagnostic imaging|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=69–118|pmid=1863349}}</ref> Sometimes prior to the MRI scan, an [[intravenous]] injection of a contrasting material called [[gadolinium]] to allow for a more detailed image. Patients on dialysis or have renal insufficiency should avoid this contrasting material as it may induce a rare, yet severe, side effect known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.<ref name=Nishimura>{{cite journal|last=Nishimura|first=K|coauthors=Hida, S; Okada, K; Yoshida, O; Nishimuara, K|title=Staging and differential diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma: a comparison of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)|journal=Hinyokika kiyo. Acta urologica Japonica|date=Aug|year=1988|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1323–31|pmid=3195400}}</ref>  A bone scan or brain imaging is not routinely performed unless signs or symptoms suggest potential metastatic involvement of these areas. 
MRI scans should also be considered to evaluate [[tumor|tumour]] extension which has grown in major blood vessels, including the [[vena cava]], in the abdomen. MRI can be used to observe the possible spread of cancer to the [[brain]] or [[spinal cord]] should the patient present symptoms that suggest this might be the case.

==== Intravenous pyelogram  ====
[[Intravenous pyelogram]] (IVP) is a useful procedure in detecting the presence of abnormal renal mass in the [[urinary tract]]. This procedure involves the injection of a contrasting dye into the arm of the patient. The dye travels from the blood stream and into the kidneys which in time, passes into the kidneys and bladder. This test is not necessary if a CT or MRI scan has been conducted.<ref name=Reznek>{{cite journal|last=Reznek|first=RH|title=CT/MRI in staging renal cell carcinoma|journal=Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society|date=Feb 14|year=2004|volume=4 Spec No A|pages=S25–32|pmid=18215972|doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2004.0012|pmc=1435344|issue=Spec No A}}</ref>

==== Renal Angiography ====
Renal [[angiography]] uses the same principle as IVP, as this type of [[X-ray]] also uses a contrasting dye. This radiologic test serves importance in diagnosing renal cell carcinoma as an aid for examining [[blood vessels]] in the kidneys. This diagnostic test relies on the contrasting agent which is injected in the renal artery to be absorbed by the cancerous cells.<ref name=Kocak>{{cite journal|last=Kocak|first=M|coauthors=Sudakoff, GS; Erickson, S; Begun, F; Datta, M|title=Using MR angiography for surgical planning in pelvic kidney renal cell carcinoma|journal=AJR. American journal of roentgenology|date=Sep|year=2001|volume=177|issue=3|pages=659–60|pmid=11517066|doi=10.2214/ajr.177.3.1770659}}</ref> The contrasting dye provides a clearer outline of abnormally-oriented blood vessels believed to be involved with the tumour.  This is imperative for surgeons as it allows the patient’s blood vessels to be mapped prior to operation.<ref name="Beck" />

===Staging===
The [[Cancer staging|staging]] of renal cell carcinoma is the most important factor in predicting its prognosis.<ref name=cornellurology>[http://www.cornellurology.com/kidney/gi/rcc.shtml Kidney Cancer / General Information] at Weill Cornell Medical College, James Buchanan Brady Foundation, Department of Urology</ref> Staging can follow the [[TNM staging system]], where the size and extent of the tumour (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N) and metastases (M) are classified separately. Also, it can use overall stage grouping into stage I-IV, with the 1997 revision of AJCC described below:<ref name=cornellurology/>
{|class="wikitable"
| '''Stage I''' || Tumour of a diameter of 7&nbsp;cm (approx. 23⁄4 inches) or smaller, and limited to the kidney. No lymph node involvement or metastases to distant organs.
|-
| '''Stage II''' || Tumour larger than 7.0&nbsp;cm but still limited to the kidney. No lymph node involvement or metastases to distant organs.
|-
|rowspan=2| '''Stage III''' <br> any of the following || Tumor of any size with involvement of a nearby lymph node but no metastases to distant organs. Tumour of this stage may be with or without spread to fatty tissue around the kidney, with or without spread into the large veins leading from the kidney to the heart.

|-
| Involvement of more than one lymph node near the kidney
|-
| Involvement of any lymph node not near the kidney
|-
| Distant metastases, such as in the lungs, bone, or brain.
|}

At diagnosis, 30% of renal cell carcinomas have spread to the ipsilateral renal vein, and 5-10% have continued into the inferior vena cava.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oto A, Herts BR, Remer EM, Novick AC |title=Inferior vena cava tumor thrombus in renal cell carcinoma: staging by MR imaging and impact on surgical treatment |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol. |volume=171 |issue=6 |pages=1619–24 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9843299 |doi= 10.2214/ajr.171.6.9843299|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9843299}}</ref>

=== Histopathology ===
[[Image:Renal cell carcinoma.jpg|thumb|Renal cell carcinoma]]
[[Image:Kidney cancer.jpg|thumb|Renal cell carcinoma]]

The gross and microscopic appearance of renal cell carcinomas is highly variable. The renal cell carcinoma may present reddened areas where [[blood vessels]] have bled, and [[cysts]] containing watery fluids.<ref name="Brit">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497921/renal-carcinoma |title=Clear-cell Carcinoma, Hypernephroid Tumour, or Hypernephroma |accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> The body of the tumour shows large blood vessels that have walls composed of cancerous cells.
[[Gross examination]] often shows a yellowish, multilobulated tumor in the [[renal cortex]], which frequently contains zones of [[necrosis]], [[hemorrhage|haemorrhage]] and [[scarring]]. In a microscopic context, there are four major histologic subtypes of renal cell cancer: clear cell (conventional RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Sarcomatoid changes (morphology showing spindle cells) can be observed within any RCC subtype.  Under light microscopy, these [[tumour]] cells can exhibit [[papillae]], tubules or nests, and are quite large, atypical, and polygonal.

Recent studies have brought attention to the close association of the type of cancerous cells to the aggressiveness of the condition. Some studies suggest that these cancerous cells accumulate glycogen and lipids, their cytoplasm appear "clear", the nuclei remain in the middle of the cells, and the cellular membrane is evident.<ref name=Vasileva>{{cite journal|last=Vasil'eva|first=NN|coauthors=Koriakina, RF|title=[Morphological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Histo-cytological parallels]|journal=Arkhiv patologii|year=1976|volume=38|issue=12|pages=12–7|pmid=1016084}}</ref>  Some cells may be smaller, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, resembling normal tubular cells. The stroma is reduced, but well vascularized. The tumour compresses the surrounding parenchyma, producing a pseudocapsule.<ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/renal-cell-carcinoma-grawitz-tumor-kidney-pathology.php |title=pathologyatlas.ro |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format= |work=}}</ref>

The most common cell type exhibited by renal cell carcinoma is the [[clear cell]], which is named by the dissolving of the cells high lipid content in the cytoplasm. The clear cells are thought to be the least likely to spread and usually respond more favourably to treatment. However, most of the tumours contain a mixture of cells. The most aggressive stage of renal cancer is believed to be the one in which the [[tumor|tumour]] is mixed, containing both clear and granular cells.<ref name=Lopez>{{cite journal|last=López|first=JI|title=Renal tumors with clear cells. A review|journal=Pathology, research and practice|date=Mar|year=2013|volume=209|issue=3|pages=137–46|pmid=23433880|doi=10.1016/j.prp.2013.01.007}}</ref> 

The recommended histologic grading schema for RCC is the Fuhrman system (1982), which is an assessment based on the microscopic morphology of a [[neoplasm]] with [[haematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] (H&E staining). This system categorises renal cell carcinoma with grades 1, 2, 3, 4 based on nuclear characteristics. The details of the Fuhrman grading system for RCC are shown below:<ref name=Rioux>{{cite journal|last=Rioux-Leclercq|first=N|title=[The Fuhrman grading system for kidney cancer prognosis]|journal=Progres en urologie : journal de l'Association francaise d'urologie et de la Societe francaise d'urologie|date=Nov|year=2006|volume=16|issue=4 Suppl FMC|pages=5–8|pmid=17183964}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for renal cell carcinoma is largely influenced by a variety of factors, including tumour size, degree of invasion and metastasis, histologic type, and nuclear grade.<ref name=Rini/> For metastatic renal cell carcinoma, factors which may present a poor prognosis include a low Karnofsky performance-status score (a standard way of measuring functional impairment in patients with cancer), a low [[hemoglobin]] level, a high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, and a high corrected level of serum calcium.<ref name=Motzer1>{{cite journal|last=Motzer|first=R. J.|title=Prognostic Factors for Survival in Previously Treated Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=22 December 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=454–463|doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.06.132|pmid=14752067|last2=Bacik|first2=J|last3=Schwartz|first3=LH|last4=Reuter|first4=V|last5=Russo|first5=P|last6=Marion|first6=S|last7=Mazumdar|first7=M}}</ref><ref name=Motzer2>{{cite journal|last=Motzer|first=RJ|coauthors=Mazumdar, M; Bacik, J; Berg, W; Amsterdam, A; Ferrara, J|title=Survival and prognostic stratification of 670 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma|journal=Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology|date=Aug|year=1999|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2530–40|pmid=10561319}}</ref>  

Renal cell carcinoma is a potential source of [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] hormone production and presents “great mimic” effects. Few patients with prominent sarcomatoid features survive for more than 1 year. By contrast, 1-year overall survival after [[nephrectomy]] for clear cell renal cell carcinoma is 50%. The papillary and chromophobe types have a better prognosis than the clear cell type. The 5-year survival rate if the RCC has not extended beyond the renal capsule; survival drops to 30% if there are distant [[Metastasis|metastases]].<ref name=Oosterwijk /> Tumour spreads most frequently to the lungs and bones.<ref name=Lee>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=LS|coauthors=Yuen, JS; Sim, HG|title=Renal cell carcinoma in young patients is associated with poorer prognosis|journal=Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore|date=2011 Sep|volume=40|issue=9|pages=401–6|pmid=22065033}}</ref> 

A study in [[Turkey]] that used the 1997 AJCC staging system estimated the [[five-year survival rate]] to be 90% for stage I, 51% for stage II, 22% for stage III and 4.6% for stage IV.<ref name=Erdogan2004>{{cite DOI|10.1111/j.1368-5031.2004.00008.x}}</ref> The same study estimated the median [[survival time]] to be 7.7 years for stage I, 5.0 years for stage II, 3.1 years for stage III and 1.1 years for stage IV.<ref name=Erdogan2004/>

For those that have tumour recurrence after surgery, the prognosis is generally poor.  Renal cell carcinoma does not generally respond to chemotherapy or radiation.  Immunotherapy, which attempts to induce the body to attack the remaining cancer cells, has shown promise.  Recent trials are testing newer agents, though the current complete remission rate with these approaches are still low, around 12-20% in most series. Most recently, treatment with [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]]s including [[nexavar]], [[pazopanib]], and [[rapamycin]] have shown promise in improving the prognosis for advanced RCC.<ref name=Oosterwijk>{{cite journal|last=Oosterwijk-Wakka|first=Jeannette C.|coauthors=Kats-Ugurlu, Gürsah; Leenders, William P.J.; Kiemeney, Lambertus A.L.M.; Old, Lloyd J.; Mulders, Peter F.A.; Oosterwijk, Egbert|title=Effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment of renal cell carcinoma on the accumulation of carbonic anhydrase IX-specific chimeric monoclonal antibody cG250|journal=BJU International|date=1 January 2011|volume=107|issue=1|pages=118–125|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09314.x|pmid=20346054}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
The type of treatment depends on multiple factors and the individual, some of which include:<ref name=cohen /><ref name="simmons">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management.|publisher=Humana Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=105–118|author=Simmons|coauthors=Campbell|chapter=Assessment of Oncologic Risk for Clinical Stage T1 Renal Tumours}}</ref> 
* Which stage the renal cell carcinoma is in
* Which organs and parts of the body are affected or unaffected
* What type of Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
* Any pre-existing or comorbid conditions the person has
* Overall health and Age of the person
Every form of treatment does have both risks and benefits involved, a health care professional will provide the best options that suit the individual circumstances.

=== Active Surveillance ===
Active surveillance or "Watchful waiting" is becoming more common as small renal masses or tumours are being detected and also within the older generation surgery is not always suitable.<ref name="smaldone" /> Active surveillance involves completing various diagnostic procedures, tests and imaging to monitor the progression of the RCC before embarking on a more high risk treatment option like surgery.<ref name="smaldone">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management.|year=2013|publisher=Humana Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=167–196|author=Smaldone|coauthors=Canter, Kutikov, Uzzo|chapter=Active Surveillance of the Small Renal Mass}}</ref> In the elderly, patients with co-morbidities and in poor surgical candidates, this is especially useful.

=== Surgery ===
''Radical Nephrectomy'' involves the removal of the affected kidney including [[Renal fascia|Gerota's fascia]], the [[adrenal gland]] which is on the same side as the affected kidney, and the regional lymph nodes all at the same time.<ref name="cohen" /> This method although severe is effective. But it is not always appropriate, as it is a major surgery that contains the risk of complication both during and after the surgery and can have a longer recovery time.<ref name="casey">{{cite journal|last=Casey|first=R.G.|coauthors=Raheem, O.A.; Elmusharaf, E.; Madhavan, P.; Tolan, M.; Lynch, T.H.|title=Renal cell carcinoma with IVC and atrial thrombus: A single centre's 10 year surgical experience|journal=The Surgeon|date=NaN undefined NaN|year=2013|pages=1–5|doi=10.1016/j.surge.2013.02.007}}</ref>  It is important to note that the other kidney must be fully functional, and this technique is  most often used when there is a large tumour present in only one kidney. <br />
''Nephron Sparing Partial Nephrectomy'' is used when the tumour is small (less than 4&nbsp;cm in diameter) or when the patient has other medical concerns such as [[diabetes]] or [[hypertension]].<ref name="cohen" /> The partial nephrectomy involves the removal of the affected tissue only, sparing the rest of the kidney, Gerota's fascia and the regional lymph nodes. This allows for more renal preservation as compared to the radical nephrectomy, and this can have positive long term health benefits. <br />
''Laprascopic Nephrectomy.'' Uses [[Laparoscopic surgery|Laprascopic]] surgical or minimally invasive surgical techniques. Commonly referred to as key hole surgery, this surgery does not have the large incisions seen in the Radical or Partial Nephrectomy. But still successfully removes either all or part of the kidney. Laprascopic surgery is associated with shorter stays in hospital and quicker recovery time. But there are still risks associated with the surgical procedure.<br />
''Surgery for Metastatic disease'' If metastatic disease is present surgical treatment is still a viable option. Radical and partial nephrectomies can still occur, and in some cases if the metastasis is small this can be surgically removed.<ref name=cohen /> This depends again on what stage of growth and how far spread the disease is.

=== Targeted Ablative Therapies ===
(Targeted Ablative Therapies can also be known as [[Percutaneous]] Ablative Therapies )Although the development of laprascopic surgical techniques that are used to complete nephrectomies has reduced some of the risks associated with surgery,<ref name="russo">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management.|year=2013|publisher=Humana Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=119–132|author=Russo|chapter=Radical Nephrectomy for Localised Renal Tumours: Oncological and Renal Functional Considerations}}</ref> surgery of any sort in some cases will still not be feasible. For example the elderly, people already suffering from severe renal dysfunction or people who have several [[Comorbidities]] surgery of any sort is not warranted.<ref name="matin">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management.|year=2013|publisher=Humana Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=155–166|author=Matin|coauthors=Ahrar|chapter=Thermal Ablation}}</ref> Instead there are targeted therapies which do not involve the removal of any organs or serious surgery. Rather these therapies involve the [[ablation]] of the tumour or the affected area. Two main types of ablation techniques are used for Renal cell carcinoma and they are [[Cryoablation]] and [[Radio frequency ablation]] or thermal ablation.<ref name="matin" /> Ablative treatments use imaging such as [[Computed tomography]] (CT) or [[MRI|Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) to identify the location of the tumours, which ideally are smaller than 3.5&nbsp;cm in size and to guide the treatment. However there are some cases where ablation can be used on tumours that are larger.<ref name="matin" />
[[Radio frequency ablation]] uses radio frequencies to generate heat through the friction of water molecules which in turn destroys the tumour tissue.<ref name="cohen" /> An electrode is inserted into the affected tissue and the radio frequencies are generated. Cell death will generally occur within minutes of being exposed to temperatures of or above 50°C.
Similar to radio frequency ablation, [[Cryoablation]] involves the insertion of a probe in to the affected area.<ref name="cohen" /> However in this case instead of heat being used to kill the tumour cold is. The probe is cooled with chemical fluids which are very cold. The freezing temperatures cause the tumour cells to die by causing [[osmotic dehydration]], which pulls the water out of the cell destroying the [[enzyme]],[[organelle]]s, [[cell membrane]] and freezing the [[cytoplasm]].<ref name="matin" />

=== Immunotherapy and Medications ===
[[Immunomodulatory|Immunotherapy]] is a method that targets the persons immune system and uses it to their own advantage, this was developed after the observation was made that in some cases there was spontaneous regression.<ref name="davar">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management.|year=2013|publisher=Humana Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=279–302|author=Davar|coauthors=Fenton, Appleman|chapter=Immunotherapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma}}</ref>  That is the renal cell carcinoma improved or reverted to a lower phase with no other therapies. Immunotherapy capitalises on this phenomenon and aims to build up a persons immune response to particular cancer cells or agents.<ref name="davar" /> Other medications that have been developed target things such as growth factors that have been shown to promote the growth of tumours.<ref name="serova">{{cite journal|last=Serova|first=Maria|coauthors=Gramont, Armand; Tijeras-Raballand, Annemilaï; Santos, Célia; Riveiro, Maria Eugenia; Slimane, Khemaies; Faivre, Sandrine; Raymond, Eric|title=Benchmarking effects of mTOR, PI3K, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma models developing resistance to sunitinib and sorafenib|journal=Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology|date=12|year=2013|month=March|pages=1–11|doi=10.1007/s00280-013-2129-6}}</ref> They inhibit the growth factor which promotes the growth of tumours to prevent tumours from forming.<ref name="stroup">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management.|year=2013|publisher=Humana Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=219–230|author=Stroup|chapter=Neoadjuvant Targeted Therapy and Concolodative Surgery}}</ref> There have been many different medications developed and most have only been approved in the last 7 or so years.<ref name="sternberg">{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Cora N.|coauthors=Hawkins, Robert E.; Wagstaff, John; Salman, Pamela; Mardiak, Jozef; Barrios, Carlos H.; Zarba, Juan J.; Gladkov, Oleg A.; Lee, Eunsik; Szczylik, Cezary; McCann, Lauren; Rubin, Stephen D.; Chen, Mei; Davis, Ian D.|title=A randomised, double-blind phase III study of pazopanib in patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma: Final overall survival results and safety update|journal=European Journal of Cancer|date=NaN undefined NaN|year=2013|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1287–1296|doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2012.12.010|pmid=23321547}}</ref>
Some of the most recently developed treatments are listed below:
* [[Axitinib]]
* [[Bevacizumab]]
* [[Carfilzomib]]
* [[Everolimus]]
* [[Interferon]]/[[Interferon-α]]
* [[Interleukin 2|Interleukin-2]]
* [[Revlimid|Lenalidomide/Revlimid]]
* [[Pazopanib]]
* [[Rapamycin|Sirolimus/Rapamycin]]
* [[Sorafenib]]
* [[Sunitinib]]
* [[Temsirolimus]]
* [[Thalomid]]
* [[Tivozanib]]
Each of the treatments listed above are slightly different, some only work for a little while and others need to be used in conjunction with other therapies.There are also different side effects and risks associated with different forms of medication. As always the advice of a Health Care professional should be sought if considering any of the therapies mentioned

=== Chemotherapy ===
[[Chemotherapy]] and [[Radiotherapy]] are not as successful in the case of RCC. RCC is resistant in most cases but there is about a 4-5% success rate sometimes, but this is often short lived with more tumours and growths developing later.<ref name=cohen />

=== Vaccine ===
[[Cancer vaccines]] are being developed but so far have been found to be effective for only certain forms of the RCC.<ref name="cohen" /> The vaccines are being designed to "prime" the immune system to provide tumour specific immunity.<ref name="davar" /> They are still being developed but the present another treatment possibility.

=== Advjuvant Therapy ===
[[Adjuvant therapy]] is a form of treatment that is given after a primary treatment has already been administered. In the example of RCC the adjuvant therapies tend to be the medications such as [[Interleukin 2|Interleukin-2]] which are given after the renal nephrectomy surgery.<ref name=stroup /> The idea behind this method is that the adjuvant therapy will prevent the cancer from returning as sometimes cancerous cells can remain in the body after the primary tumour has been removed.,ref name="cohen" />. A newer form of adjuvant therapy is [[Neoadjuvant therapy]] this is similar to adjuvant therapy but in this case the treatment is administered before the intended primary or main treatment. In some cases neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to decrease the size and stage of the RCC to then allow it to be surgically removed.<ref name="stroup" /> This is a very new form of treatment and the effectiveness is still being assessed. There are not RCC specific Adjuvant or Neoadjuvant therapies, but trials are still ongoing.

== Metastatic renal cell carcinoma ==
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is the spread of the primary renal cell carcinoma from the kidney to other organs. 25-30% of sufferers have this metastatic spread by the time they are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma.<ref name="DoisMissing">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00345-004-0466-0|title=Novel approaches in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma|year=2005|last1=Lam|first1=John S.|last2=Leppert|first2=John T.|last3=Belldegrun|first3=Arie S.|last4=Figlin|first4=Robert A.|journal=World Journal of Urology|volume=23|issue=3|pages=202–12|pmid=15812574}}</ref> This high proportion is explained by the fact that clinical signs are generally mild until the disease progresses to a more severe state.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2007.03.035|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Guideline|year=2007|last1=Ljungberg|first1=Börje|last2=Hanbury|first2=Damian C.|last3=Kuczyk|first3=Marcus A.|last4=Merseburger|first4=Axel S.|last5=Mulders|first5=Peter F.A.|last6=Patard|first6=Jean-Jacques|last7=Sinescu|first7=Ioanel C.|journal=European Urology|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1502–10|pmid=17408850|author8=European Association of Urology Guideline Group for renal cell carcinoma}}</ref> The most common sites for metastasis are the lymph nodes, lung, bones, liver and brain.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM199609193351207|title=Renal-Cell Carcinoma|year=1996|last1=Motzer|first1=Robert J.|last2=Bander|first2=Neil H.|last3=Nanus|first3=David M.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=335|issue=12|pages=865–75|pmid=8778606}}</ref> How this spread affects the staging of the disease and hence prognosis is discussed in the “Diagnosis” and “Prognosis” section. 

MRCC has a poor prognosis compared to other cancers although average survival times have increased in the last few years due to treatment advances. Average survival time in 2008 for the metastatic form of the disease was under a year<ref name="DoictrvMissing" /> and by 2013 this improved  to an average of 22 months.<ref name="DoiCADbeecMissing">{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283609ec1|title=Chemotherapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma today?

The available treatments for RCC discussed in the “Treatment” section are also relevant for the metastatic form of the disease. The most relevant of these is  Interleukin-2 which is the standard therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma.<ref name="nejm" /> In the past six years, seven new treatments have been approved specifically for mRCC (Sunitinib, Temsirolimus, Bevacizumab, Sorafenib, Everolimus, Pazopanib and Axitiniband).<ref name=singer /> These new treatments are based on the fact that renal cell carcinomas are very vascular tumors – they contain a large number of blood vessels. The drugs aim to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the tumors, hence slowing growth and in some cases reducing the size of the tumors.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.06.010|title=What is the optimal therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who progress on an initial VEGFr-TKI?|year=2013|last1=Calvo|first1=Emiliano|last2=Ravaud|first2=Alain|last3=Bellmunt|first3=Joaquim|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=39|issue=4|pages=366–74|pmid=22832091}}</ref> 
Side effects unfortunately are quite common with these treatments and include:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.12.006|title=A contemporary update on rates and management of toxicities of targeted therapies for metastatic renal cell carcinoma|year=2013|last1=Alasker|first1=Ahmed|last2=Meskawi|first2=Malek|last3=Sun|first3=Maxine|last4=Ismail|first4=Salima|last5=Hanna|first5=Nawar|last6=Hansen|first6=Jens|last7=Tian|first7=Zhe|last8=Bianchi|first8=Marco|last9=Perrotte|first9=Paul|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=39|issue=4|pages=388–401|pmid=23317510}}</ref> 
* Gastrointestinal effects - nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia
* Respiratory effects  - coughing, dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
* Cardiovascular effects -hypertension(high blood pressure)
* Neurological effects - intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), thrombosis (blood clots) in the brain
* Effects on the skin and mucus membranes - rashes, hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis
* Bone marrow suppression -resulting in reduced white blood cells, increasing the risk of infections plus anemia and reduced platelets
* Renal effects - impaired kidney function 
* Fatigue.

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are more commonly used in the metastatic form of RCC to target the secondary tumors in the bones, liver, brain and other organs. While not curative, these treatments do provide relief for suffers from symptoms associated with the spread of tumors.<ref name="DoiCADbeecMissing" />  
Other potential treatments are still being developed, including tumor vaccines and small molecule inhibitors.<ref name="DoisMissing" />
