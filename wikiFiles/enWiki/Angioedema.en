'''Angioedema''' ([[British English|BE]]: '''angiooedema''') or '''Quincke's edema''' is the rapid swelling ([[edema]]) of the [[dermis]], [[subcutaneous tissue]],<ref name="Dorlands">{{DorlandsDict|one/000004995|angioedema}}</ref> [[mucosa]] and submucosal tissues.  It is very similar to [[urticaria]], but urticaria, commonly known as hives, occurs in the upper dermis.<ref name="Dorlands"/> The term '''angioneurotic oedema''' was used for this condition in the belief that there was [[nervous system]] involvement, but this is no longer thought to be the case.
 
Cases where angioedema progresses rapidly should be treated as a [[medical emergency]], as [[airway obstruction]] and [[suffocation]] can occur. [[Epinephrine]] may be life-saving when the cause of angioedema is allergic. In the case of hereditary angioedema, treatment with [[epinephrine]] has not been shown to be helpful.

==Classification==
Angioedema is classified as either hereditary or acquired. 

'''Acquired angioedema''' can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic.<ref name=Axelrod2011>{{cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=S|coauthors=Davis-Lorton, M|title=Urticaria and angioedema|journal=The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York|year=2011|volume=78|issue=5|pages=784–802|pmid=21913206|doi=10.1002/msj.20288}}</ref> It is usually caused by [[allergy]] and occurs together with other allergic symptoms and [[urticaria]]. It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly [[ACE inhibitor]]s.

'''[[Hereditary angioedema]]''' (HAE) exists in three forms, all of which are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]] form. They are distinguished by the underlying genetic abnormality. Types I and II are caused by mutations in the ''SERPING1'' gene, which result in either dimished levels of the [[C1-inhibitor]] protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE). Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the ''F12'' gene, which encodes the coagulation protein [[factor XII]]. All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the [[complement system]], and all forms can cause swelling elsewhere in the body, such as the [[digestive tract]]. If HAE involves the [[larynx]], it can cause life-threatening [[asphyxiation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zuraw BL |title=Clinical practice. Hereditary angioedema |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=10 |pages=1027–36 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18768946 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp0803977}}</ref> The pathogenesis of this disorder is suspected to be related to unopposed activation of the contact pathway by the initial generation of kallikrein and/or clotting factor XII by damaged endothelial cells. The end product of this cascade, bradykinin, is produced in large amounts and is believed to be the predominant mediator leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation that induces typical angioedema "attacks".<ref>{{cite web|last=Loew|first=Burr|title=A 68-Year-Old Woman With Recurrent Abdominal Pain, Nausea, and Vomiting|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/743937_2|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Angioedema2013.JPG|thumb|Angioedema of half of the tongue]]
The skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the [[tongue]], swell up over the period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands.  The swelling can be [[itch]]y or painful.  There may also be slightly decreased sensation in the affected areas due to compression of the nerves. [[Urticaria]] (hives) may develop simultaneously.

In severe cases, [[stridor]] of the airway occurs, with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and decreasing [[oxygen]] levels. [[Tracheal intubation]] is required in these situations to prevent [[respiratory arrest]] and risk of death.

Sometimes, the cause is recent exposure to an [[allergen]] (e.g. [[peanut]]s), but more often it is either [[idiopathic]] (unknown) or only weakly correlated to allergen exposure.

In hereditary angioedema, often no direct cause is identifiable, although mild [[Physical trauma|trauma]], including dental work and other stimuli, can cause attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bork K, Barnstedt Se |title=Laryngeal edema and death from asphyxiation after tooth extraction in four patients with hereditary angioedema |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=134 |issue=8 |pages=1088–94 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12956349 |doi= |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12956349}}</ref> There is usually no associated itch or urticaria, as it is not an allergic response.  Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes (often called "attacks") of [[abdominal pain]], usually accompanied by intense vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, watery diarrhea, and an unraised, nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash.  These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average, and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration. Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause a significant increase in the patient's white blood cell count, usually in the vicinity of 13,000 to 30,000.  As the symptoms begin to diminish, the white count slowly begins to decrease, returning to normal when the attack subsides. As the symptoms and diagnostic tests are almost indistinguishable from an [[acute abdomen]] (e.g. perforated [[appendicitis]]) it is possible for undiagnosed HAE patients to undergo [[laparotomy]] (operations on the abdomen) or [[laparoscopy]] (keyhole surgery) that turns out to have been unnecessary.

HAE may also cause swelling in a variety of other locations, most commonly the limbs, genitals, neck, throat and face. The pain associated with these swellings varies from mildly uncomfortable to agonizing pain, depending on its location and severity. Predicting where and when the next episode of edema will occur is impossible. Most patients have an average of one episode per month, but there are also patients who have weekly episodes or only one or two episodes per year. The triggers can vary and include infections, minor injuries, mechanical irritation, operations or stress. In most cases, edema develops over a period of 12–36 hours and then subsides within 2–5 days.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made on the clinical picture. Routine blood tests ([[complete blood count]], [[electrolyte]]s, [[renal function]], [[liver enzyme]]s) are typically performed. [[Tryptase|Mast cell tryptase]] levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic (anaphylactic) reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; [[complement system|complement]] levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of ''[[C1-inhibitor]]''. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed angioedema along with normal C1 levels and function.

The hereditary form (HAE) often goes undetected for a long time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to [[antihistamines]] or [[glucocorticoid|steroids]], a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides a family history of the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive due to the lack of regulation by C1-INH.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Bradykinin]] plays a critical role in all forms of hereditary angioedema.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bas M, Adams V, Suvorava T, Niehues T, Hoffmann TK, Kojda G |title=Nonallergic angioedema: role of bradykinin |journal=Allergy |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=842–56 |year=2007 |pmid=17620062 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01427.x}}</ref> This [[peptide]] is a potent [[vasodilator]] and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. This is most obvious in the face, where the skin has relatively little supporting [[connective tissue]], and edema develops easily. Bradykinin is released by various cell types in response to numerous different stimuli; it is also a [[pain]] mediator.  Dampening or inhibiting [[bradykinin]] has been shown to relieve HAE symptoms.

Various mechanisms that interfere with bradykinin production or degradation can lead to angioedema. ACE inhibitors block [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme|ACE]], the enzyme that among other actions, degrades bradykinin. In [[hereditary angioedema]], bradykinin formation is caused by continuous activation of the [[complement system]] due to a deficiency in one of its prime inhibitors, C1-esterase (aka: C1-inhibitor or C1INH), and continuous production of [[kallikrein]], another process inhibited by C1INH. This [[serine protease inhibitor]] (serpin) normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which - in turn - activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the [[coagulation]] cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of [[hemorrhage]] and [[thrombosis]] appear to be limited.

The three types of hereditary angioedema are:
* Type I - decreased levels of C1INH (85%);
* Type II - normal levels, but decreased function of C1INH (15%);
* Type III - no detectable abnormality in C1INH, occurs in an [[X-linked]] dominant fashion and therefore mainly affects women; it can be exacerbated by [[pregnancy]] and use of [[hormonal contraception]] (exact frequency uncertain).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bork K, Barnstedt SE, Koch P, Traupe H |title=Hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor activity in women |journal=Lancet |volume=356 |issue=9225 |pages=213–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10963200 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02483-1}}</ref> It has been linked with mutations in the [[factor XII]] gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cichon S, Martin L, Hennies HC, ''et al.'' |title=Increased activity of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) causes hereditary angioedema type III |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=1098–104 |year=2006 |pmid=17186468 |doi=10.1086/509899 |pmc=1698720}}</ref>

Angioedema can be due to [[antibody]] formation against C1INH; this is an [[autoimmune disorder]]. This acquired angioedema is associated with the development of [[lymphoma]].

Consumption of foods which are themselves vasodilators, such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[cinnamon]], can increase the probability of an angioedema episode in susceptible patients.  If the episode occurs at all after the consumption of these foods, its onset may be delayed overnight or by some hours, making the correlation with their consumption somewhat difficult. In contrast, consumption of [[bromelain]] in combination with [[turmeric]] may be beneficial in reducing symptoms.<ref>University of Maryland Medical Center.  ''Angioedema.'' http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/angioedema-000011.htm</ref>

The use of [[ibuprofen]] or [[aspirin]] may increase the probability of an episode in some patients.  The use of [[acetaminophen]] typically has a smaller, but still present, increase in the probability of an episode.

==Management==

=== Allergic ===
In allergic angioedema, avoidance of the allergen and use of antihistamines may prevent future attacks. [[Cetirizine]] is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for angioedema.  Some patients have reported success with the combination of a nightly low dose of cetirizine to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear.  Severe angioedema cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require [[glucocorticoid|steroid]] therapy, which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, [[epinephrine]] may be life-saving.

=== Hereditary ===
In [[hereditary angioedema]], specific stimuli that have previously led to attacks may need to be avoided in the future. It does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. Acute treatment consists of C1-INH concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously. In an emergency, fresh frozen blood plasma, which also contains C1-INH, can also be used. However, in most European countries, C1-INH concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programmes. 

Future attacks of hereditary angioedema can be prevented by the use of androgens such as [[danazol]], [[oxandrolone]] or [[methyltestosterone]]. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Metallopeptidase activities in hereditary angioedema: effect of androgen prophylaxis on plasma aminopeptidase P|author=Drouet C, Désormeaux A, Robillard J, Ponard D, Bouillet L, Martin L, et al.|pmid=18158172|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol|volume=121|issue=2|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.10.048|pages=429–33}}</ref> kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema.

=== Acquired ===
In acquired angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as [[tranexamic acid]] or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. [[Cinnarizine]] may also be useful because it blocks the activation of C4 and can be used in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot [http://www.iaari.hbi.ir/journal/archive/articles/v4n3mor.pdf].

==History==
[[Heinrich Quincke]] first described the clinical picture of angioedema in 1882,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Quincke H|title=Über akutes umschriebenes Hautödem|journal=Monatsh Prakt Derm|year=1882|volume=1|pages=129–131}}</ref> though there had been some earlier descriptions of the condition.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|482}}</ref><ref>Marcello Donati. De medica historia mirabili. Mantuae, per Fr. Osanam, 1586</ref><ref>J. L. Milton. On giant urticaria. Edinburgh Medical Journal, 1876, 22: 513-526.</ref>

[[William Osler]] remarked in 1888 that some cases may have a hereditary basis; he coined the term "hereditary angio-neurotic edema".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Osler W|title=Hereditary angio-neurotic oedema|journal=Am J Med Sci|year=1888|volume=95|pages=362–67|doi=10.1097/00000441-188804000-00004|pmid=20145434|issue=2}}</ref>

The link with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency was proved in 1963.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Donaldson VH, Evans RR |title=A biochemical abnormality in hereditary angioneurotic edema: absence of serum inhibitor of C' 1-esterase |journal=Am.
