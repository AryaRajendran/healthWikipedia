[[File:Prepulse Inhibition schematically.png|thumb|300px|Prepulse inhibition: preceding stimulus attenuates the [[Startle reaction|startle response]].]]

'''Prepulse Inhibition''' ('''PPI''') is a neurological phenomenon in which a weaker prestimulus ('''prepulse''') inhibits the reaction of an [[organism]] to a subsequent strong startling stimulus ('''pulse'''). The stimuli are usually acoustic, but tactile stimuli (e.g. via air puffs onto the skin) <ref name="Braff_1992_PPI_schizophrenia_tactile">{{cite journal |pmid=1567275 |year=1992 |last1=Braff |first1=DL |last2=Grillon |first2=C |last3=Geyer |first3=MA |title=Gating and habituation of the startle reflex in schizophrenic patients |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=206–15 |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1992.01820030038005}}</ref> and light stimuli <ref name="Weber_Swerdlow_ligth">{{cite journal |pmid=17900675 |year=2008 |last1=Weber |first1=M |last2=Swerdlow |first2=NR |title=Rat strain differences in startle gating-disruptive effects of apomorphine occur with both acoustic and visual prepulses |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=306–11 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2007.08.014 |pmc=2266874 |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior}}</ref> are also used.

The reduction of the amplitude of startle reflects the ability of the nervous system to temporarily adapt to a strong sensory stimulus when a preceding weaker signal is given to warn the organism. PPI is detected in numerous species ranging from mice to human. Although the extent of the adaptation affects numerous systems, the most comfortable to measure are the muscular reactions, which are normally diminished as a result of the nervous inhibition.

Deficits of prepulse inhibition manifest in the inability to filter out the unnecessary information; they have been linked to abnormalities of sensorimotor gating. Such deficits are noted in patients suffering from illnesses like [[schizophrenia]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], and in people under the influence of drugs, surgical manipulations, or mutations. Human studies of PPI have been summarised in reviews by Braff et al. (2001)<ref name="Braff_2001_review">{{cite journal |pmid=11549226 |year=2001 |last1=Braff |first1=DL |last2=Geyer |first2=MA |last3=Swerdlow |first3=NR |title=Human studies of prepulse inhibition of startle: Normal subjects, patient groups, and pharmacological studies |volume=156 |issue=2–3 |pages=234–58 |journal=Psychopharmacology |doi=10.1007/s002130100810}}</ref> and Swerdlow et al.

== Procedure ==
[[File:Matt's PhD Study.jpg|thumb|PPI measurement in human.]]
The main three parts of the procedure are prepulse, startle stimulus, and startle reflex. Different ''prepulse-to-pulse intervals'', or ''lead intervals'', are used: 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 ms. Lead interval counts from the start of prepulse to the start of the pulse.
With the interval exceeding 500 ms, '''prepulse facilitation''' - increased response - is most likely to follow.<ref name="Geyer_2002_Mouse_models_review">{{cite journal |pmid=12476318 |year=2002 |last1=Geyer |first1=MA |last2=McIlwain |first2=KL |last3=Paylor |first3=R |title=Mouse genetic models for prepulse inhibition: An early review |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=1039–53 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001159 |journal=Molecular psychiatry}}</ref>

Burst of [[white noise]] is usually used as acoustic startle stimulus. Typical durations are 20 ms for prepulse and 40 ms for pulse. Background noise with 65-70 dB is used in human studies, and 30-40 dB in rodent experiments. Prepulse is typically set 3-12 dB louder than background. Startle response is measured in rodents using the so-called automated "startle chambers" or "stabilimeter chambers", with detectors recording whole-body reaction.<ref name="Geyer_2002_Mouse_models_review" />

In humans, the movements of [[oculomotor muscles]] ("''eye-blink reflex''" or "''eye-blink response''" assessed using electromyographic recording of [[orbicularis oculi]] muscle and by [[oculography]]) could be used as a measure.
Pulse-alone results are compared to prepulse-plus-pulse, and the percentage of the reduction in the startle reflex represents prepulse inhibition.
Possible hearing impairment must be taken into account, as, for example, several strains of mice develop high frequency hearing loss when they mature.<ref name="Geyer_2002_Mouse_models_review" />

== Major features ==
* The magnitude of PPI is often significant, reaching as much as 65% in healthy subjects.
* Maximum inhibition is typically observed at 120 ms interval.<ref name="Graham_1975">{{cite journal |pmid=1153628 |year=1975 |last1=Graham |first1=FK |title=Presidential Address, 1974.

* The opposite reaction, '''Prepulse Facilitation''' ('''PPF'''), is typically noted when the interval between stimuli lasts longer than 500 ms.  PPF is thought to reflect, at least partially, sustained attention.
* There is noted sex difference in prepulse inhibition, with men having higher PPI, while women having higher PPF.<ref name="Aasen_2005_sex_PPI">{{cite journal |pmid=15671127 |year=2005 |last1=Aasen |first1=I |last2=Kolli |first2=L |last3=Kumari |first3=V |title=Sex effects in prepulse inhibition and facilitation of the acoustic startle response: Implications for pharmacological and treatment studies |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=39–45 |doi=10.1177/0269881105048890 |journal=Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)}}</ref>

* Even the very first prepulse of the test session induces inhibition, which indicates that conditioning and learning are not necessary for this effect to occur. However, the lack of conditionality has been questioned.<ref name="Distraction and action">Amsterdam; New York : Elsevier, 2001 ''Attraction, Distraction and Action: multiple perspectives on attentional capture''; By Charles L.

* It is thought that the short intervals used in PPI task do not give enough time for the activation of a [[volition (psychology)|volition]]al response.
* Prepulses could be attended or ignored, and attention affects the outcome. In one study, normal college students were instructed to attend to one of the kind of prepulses, high- or low-pitched, and ignore the other. Attended prepulse caused significantly greater inhibition at the 120 ms interval compared to the ignored one, and significantly greater facilitation at the 2000 ms interval.<ref name="Filion_1993_attention">{{cite journal |pmid=8218613 |year=1993 |last1=Filion |first1=DL |last2=Dawson |first2=ME |last3=Schell |first3=AM |title=Modification of the acoustic startle-reflex eyeblink: A tool for investigating early and late attentional processes |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=185–200 |journal=Biological Psychology |doi=10.1016/0301-0511(93)90001-O}}</ref>
* Louder background noise increases the amplitude of the startle response.
* Increased prepulse duration leads to increase in PPI.
* Steady background noise facilitates the startle response, while pulsed background produces inhibition.<ref name="Hoffman_1963_steady_vs_pulse">{{cite journal |pmid=14043340 |year=1963 |last1=Hoffman |first1=HS |last2=Fleshler |first2=M |title=Startle Reaction: Modification by Background Acoustic Stimulation |volume=141 |issue=3584 |pages=928–30 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.141.3584.928}}</ref>

== Disruption of PPI ==
Disruptions of PPI are studied in humans and many other species. The most studied are deficits of PPI in schizophrenia, although this disease is not the only one to cause such deficits. They have been noted in [[panic disorder]] (Ludewig, et al., 2005), [[schizotypal personality disorder]],<ref name="Cadenhead_1993_Schizotypal">{{cite journal |pmid=8238643 |year=1993 |last1=Cadenhead |first1=KS |last2=Geyer |first2=MA |last3=Braff |first3=DL |title=Impaired startle prepulse inhibition and habituation in patients with schizotypal personality disorder |volume=150 |issue=12 |pages=1862–7 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref> [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]](Swerdlow et al., 1993), [[Huntington's disease]],<ref name="Swerdlow_1995_Huntington">{{cite journal |pmid=7876851 |year=1995 |last1=Swerdlow |first1=NR |last2=Paulsen |first2=J |last3=Braff |first3=DL |last4=Butters |first4=N |last5=Geyer |first5=MA |last6=Swenson |first6=MR |title=Impaired prepulse inhibition of acoustic and tactile startle response in patients with Huntington's disease |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=192–200 |pmc=1073317 |journal=Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry |doi=10.1136/jnnp.58.2.192}}</ref> [[nocturnal enuresis]] and [[attention deficit disorder]] (Ornitz et al. 1992), and [[Tourette's syndrome]] (Swerdlow et al. 1994; Castellanos et al. 1996). According to one study, people who have [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] with [[psychosis]] also show decreases in PPI, unlike those who have TLE without psychosis.<ref name="Morton_1994_TLE">Morton, N., Gray, N.S., Mellers, J., Toone, B., Lishman, W.A., & Gray, J.A. (1994). ''Prepulse inhibition in temporal lobe epilepsy.'' Schizophrenic Research, 15, 191.</ref> Therefore, PPI deficits are not typical to specific disease, but rather tell of disruptions in a specific brain circuit.

=== PPI deficit in schizophrenia ===

In theory, PPI disruption in schizophrenia may be related to the processes of sensory flooding and cognitive fragmentation.

Antipsychotic medication have been shown to increase PPI in patients, with atypical antipsychotics having more effect. Patients display the same gender difference in PPI as healthy people: males have higher PPI compared to females. One notable finding is that patients are specifically deficient in PPI with 60 ms prepulse intervals relative to intervals of other lengths; this remains so even under antipsychotic treatment.<ref name="Swerdlow_2006_large_cohort"/>

The other fact is the influence of cigarette smoking. Non-smoking patients have lower PPI compared to smokers, and heavy smokers have the highest PPI.<ref name="Swerdlow_2006_large_cohort">{{cite journal |pmid=17146007 |year=2006 |last1=Swerdlow |first1=NR |last2=Light |first2=GA |last3=Cadenhead |first3=KS |last4=Sprock |first4=J |last5=Hsieh |first5=MH |last6=Braff |first6=DL |title=Startle gating deficits in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia: Relationship to medications, symptoms, neurocognition, and level of function |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=1325–35 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.12.1325 |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="Kumari_2001">{{cite journal |pmid=12404567 |year=2001 |last1=Kumari |first1=V |last2=Soni |first2=W |last3=Sharma |first3=T |title=Influence of cigarette smoking on prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response in schizophrenia |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=321–326 |doi=10.1002/hup.286 |journal=Human psychopharmacology}}</ref> This finding runs in accord with the high rates of smoking among schizophrenic patients, estimated at 70%,<ref name="Leonard_2001_smoking_1">{{cite journal |pmid=11796154 |year=2001 |last1=Leonard |first1=S |last2=Adler |first2=LE |last3=Benhammou |first3=K |last4=Berger |first4=R |last5=Breese |first5=CR |last6=Drebing |first6=C |last7=Gault |first7=J |last8=Lee |first8=MJ |last9=Logel |first9=J |title=Smoking and mental illness |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=561–70 |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior |doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(01)00677-3}}</ref> with many patients smoking more than 30 cigarettes a day.<ref name="DeLeon_2002_smoking_2">{{cite journal |pmid=12084420 |year=2002 |last1=De Leon |first1=J |last2=Tracy |first2=J |last3=McCann |first3=E |last4=McGrory |first4=A |last5=Diaz |first5=FJ |title=Schizophrenia and tobacco smoking: A replication study in another US psychiatric hospital |volume=56 |issue=1–2 |pages=55–65 |journal=Schizophrenia research |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(01)00192-X}}</ref> Thus, smoking may be a way of self-medication.

=== Disruption of PPI in rodents ===
Murine models are widely used to test hypotheses linking genetic components of various diseases with sensorimotor gating. While some of the hypotheses stand to the test, others are not, as some mice models show unchanged or increased PPI contrary to the expectations, as in the tests of [[COMT]]-deficient mice.<ref name="Gogos_1998_COMT_no_effect">{{cite journal |pmid=9707588 |year=1998 |last1=Gogos |first1=JA |last2=Morgan |first2=M |last3=Luine |first3=V |last4=Santha |first4=M |last5=Ogawa |first5=S |last6=Pfaff |first6=D |last7=Karayiorgou |first7=M |title=Catechol-O-methyltransferase-deficient mice exhibit sexually dimorphic changes in catecholamine levels and behavior |volume=95 |issue=17 |pages=9991–6 |pmc=21449 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.17.9991}}</ref>

Certain surgical procedures also disrupt PPI in animals, helping to unravel the underlying circuitry.

Many animal studies of PPI are undertaken in order to understand and model the pathology of schizophrenia.<ref name="Swerdlow_1998_review_animal_models">{{cite journal |pmid=9613626 |year=1998 |last1=Swerdlow |first1=NR |last2=Geyer |first2=MA |title=Using an animal model of deficient sensorimotor gating to study the pathophysiology and new treatments of schizophrenia |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=285–301 |journal=Schizophrenia bulletin}}</ref> Schizophrenia-like PPI disruption techniques in rodents have been classified in one review<ref name="Geyer_Krebs_Thomson_2001" >{{cite journal |pmid=11549216 |year=2001 |last1=Geyer |first1=MA |last2=Krebs-Thomson |first2=K |last3=Braff |first3=DL |last4=Swerdlow |first4=NR |title=Pharmacological studies of prepulse inhibition models of sensorimotor gating deficits in schizophrenia: A decade in review |volume=156 |issue=2–3 |pages=117–54 |journal=Psychopharmacology |doi=10.1007/s002130100811}}</ref> into four models:
* PPI impairment driven by [[dopamine]]-receptor agonists, most validated for [[antipsychotic]] studies;
* PPI impairment by [[5-HT2 receptor]] agonists;
* PPI impairment by [[NMDAR]] antagonists;
* PPI impairment by developmental intervention (isolation rearing, maternal deprivation).
Diverse chemical compounds are tested on animals with such deficits. Compounds that are able to restore PPI could be further investigated for their potential antipsychotic role.

An updated summary of both preclinical and clinical findings with PPI can be found in a recent comprehensive review.<ref name="Swerdlow_2008_review_PPI_schizophrenia" />
