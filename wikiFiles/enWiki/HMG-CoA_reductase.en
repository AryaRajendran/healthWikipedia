'''HMG-CoA reductase''' (or '''3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase''' or '''HMGCR''') is the rate-controlling [[enzyme]] ({{EC number|1.1.1.88}}) of the [[mevalonate]] pathway, the [[metabolic pathway]] that produces [[cholesterol]] and other isoprenoids. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor as well as oxidized species of cholesterol. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol, an important determinant of atherosclerosis.<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: HMGCR 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3156| accessdate = }}</ref> This enzyme is thus the target of the widely available cholesterol-lowering drugs known collectively as the [[statins]]. HMG-CoA reductase is anchored in the membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and was long regarded as having seven transmembrane domains, with the active site located in a long carboxyl terminal domain in the cytosol. More recent evidence shows it to contain eight transmembrane domains.<ref name="pmid1374417">{{cite journal | author = Roitelman J, Olender EH, Bar-Nun S, Dunn WA, Simoni RD | title = Immunological evidence for eight spans in the membrane domain of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase: implications for enzyme degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum | journal = J.

The enzyme commission designation is EC 1.1.1.34 for the NADPH-dependent enzyme, whereas 1.1.1.88 links to an NADH-dependent enzyme.

In humans, the gene for HMG-CoA reductase is located on the long arm of the fifth [[chromosome]] (5q13.3-14).<ref name="pmid3866240">{{cite journal | author = Lindgren V, Luskey KL, Russell DW, Francke U | title = Human genes involved in cholesterol metabolism: chromosomal mapping of the loci for the low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase with cDNA probes | journal = Proc.

Drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, known collectively as [[HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor]]s (or "statins"), are used to lower serum [[cholesterol]] as a means of reducing the risk for [[heart disease|cardiovascular disease]].<ref name="pmid9790411">{{cite journal | author = Farmer JA | title = Aggressive lipid therapy in the statin era | journal = Prog.

These drugs include [[rosuvastatin]] (CRESTOR), [[lovastatin]] (Mevacor), [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor), [[pravastatin]] (Pravachol), [[fluvastatin]] (Lescol), [[pitavastatin]] (Livalo), and [[simvastatin]] (Zocor).<ref name="pmid14983817">{{cite journal | author = | title = Is there a "best" statin drug? | journal = Johns Hopkins Med.

=== Hormones ===
HMG-CoA reductase is active when blood glucose is high. The basic functions of [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]] are to maintain glucose homeostasis. Thus, in controlling blood sugar levels, they indirectly affect the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, but a decrease in activity of the enzyme is caused by an [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], which responds to an increase in [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] concentration, and also to [[leptin]] (see 4.4, Phosphorylation of reductase).

== Importance ==
HMG-CoA reductase is a polytopic, transmembrane protein that catalyzes a key step in the mevalonate pathway [http://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-922 (MetaCyc mevalonate pathway)], which is involved in the synthesis of sterols, isoprenoids and other lipids. In humans, HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis and represents the sole major drug target for contemporary cholesterol-lowering drugs.

The medical significance of HMG-CoA reductase has continued to expand beyond its direct role in cholesterol synthesis following the discovery that statins can offer cardiovascular health benefits independent of cholesterol reduction.<ref name=pmid15853754>{{cite journal | author = Arnaud C, Veillard NR, Mach F | title = Cholesterol-independent effects of statins in inflammation, immunomodulation and atherosclerosis | journal = Curr.

== Regulation ==
[[Image:HMGCOA-1DQA.png|thumb|HMG-CoA reductase-[[substrate (biochemistry)|Substrate]] complex (Blue:[[Coenzyme A]], red:HMG, green:[[NADPH|NADP]])]]
Regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is achieved at several levels: transcription, translation, degradation and phosphorylation.
NO
===Transcription of the reductase gene===
[[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]] of the reductase [[gene]] is enhanced by the ''[[sterol regulatory element binding protein]]'' (SREBP). This protein binds to the ''[[sterol regulatory element]]'' (SRE), located on the 5' end of the reductase gene. When [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] is inactive, it is bound to the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] or [[nuclear membrane]]. When [[cholesterol]] levels fall, SREBP is released from the membrane by [[proteolysis]] and migrates to the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it binds to the SRE and transcription is enhanced. If cholesterol levels rise, proteolytic cleavage of SREBP from the membrane ceases and any proteins in the nucleus are quickly degraded.

=== Translation of mRNA ===
[[Translation (genetics)|Translation]] of [[mRNA]] is inhibited by a [[mevalonate]] derivative, which has been reported to be [[farnesol]],<ref name="pmid8626470">{{cite journal | author = Meigs TE, Roseman DS, Simoni RD | title = Regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation by the nonsterol mevalonate metabolite farnesol in vivo | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 271 | issue = 14 | pages = 7916–22 | year = 1996 | month = April | pmid = 8626470 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.14.7916| url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/271/14/7916 }}</ref><ref name="pmid9281305">{{cite journal | author = Meigs TE, Simoni RD | title = Farnesol as a regulator of HMG-CoA reductase degradation: characterization and role of farnesyl pyrophosphatase | journal = Arch.

Biophys. | volume = 345 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 1997 | month = September | pmid = 9281305 | doi = 10.1006/abbi.1997.0200 | url = }}</ref>although this role has been disputed.<ref name="pmid8645011">{{cite journal | author = Keller RK, Zhao Z, Chambers C, Ness GC | title = Farnesol is not the nonsterol regulator mediating degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in rat liver | journal = Arch.

=== Degradation of reductase ===
Rising levels of [[sterol]]s increase the susceptibility of the reductase enzyme to ER-associated degradation ([[ERAD]]) and [[proteolysis]]. Helices 2-6 (total of 8) of the HMG-CoA reductase transmembrane domain sense the higher levels of cholesterol, which leads to the exposure of Lysine 248. This lysine residue can become ubiquinated by the E3 ligase [[AMFR]], serving as a signal for proteolytic degradation.

=== Phosphorylation of reductase ===
Short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is achieved by inhibition by [[phosphorylation]] (of Serine 872, in humans<ref name="pmid10698924">{{cite journal | author = Istvan ES, Palnitkar M, Buchanan SK, Deisenhofer J | title = Crystal structure of the catalytic portion of human HMG-CoA reductase: insights into regulation of activity and catalysis | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 819–30 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10698924 | pmc = 305622 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/19.5.819 | url = }}</ref>). Decades ago it was believed that a cascade of enzymes controls the activity of HMG-CoA reductase: an HMG-CoA reductase kinase was thought to inactivate the enzyme, and the kinase in turn was held to be activated via phosphorylation by HMG-CoA reductase kinase kinase. An excellent review on regulation of the mevalonate pathway by Nobel Laureates Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown adds specifics: HMG-CoA reductase is phosphorylated and inactivated by an [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], which also phosphorylates and inactivates [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis.<ref name="pmid1967820">{{cite journal | author = Goldstein JL, Brown MS | title = Regulation of the mevalonate pathway | journal = Nature | volume = 343 | issue = 6257 | pages = 425–30 | year = 1990 | month = February | pmid = 1967820 | doi = 10.1038/343425a0 | url = }}</ref> Thus, both pathways utilizing acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis are inactivated when energy charge is low in the cell, and concentrations of [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] rise. There has been a great deal of research on the identity of upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate the [[AMP-activated protein kinase]].<ref name="pmid12829246">{{cite journal | author = Hardie DG, Scott JW, Pan DA, Hudson ER | title = Management of cellular energy by the AMP-activated protein kinase system | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 546 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–20 | year = 2003 | month = July | pmid = 12829246 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00560-X | url = }}</ref>

Fairly recently, LKB1 has been identified as a likely AMP kinase kinase,<ref name="pmid16356723">{{cite journal | author = Witters LA, Kemp BE, Means AR | title = Chutes and Ladders: the search for protein kinases that act on AMPK | journal = Trends Biochem.

This pathway likely transduces signals from [[leptin]], [[adiponectin]], and other signaling molecules.<ref name="pmid12829246"/>
