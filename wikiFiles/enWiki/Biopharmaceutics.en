:''The term '''[[biopharmacology]]''' describes a field of research closely related to [[pharmacokinetics]], sometimes called biopharmacy.''

'''Biopharmaceutics''' is the field of study concerning biopharmaceuticals, medical drugs (see [[pharmacology]]) produced using [[biotechnology]]. They include [[proteins]] (including [[antibody|antibodies]]), [[nucleic acids]] ([[DNA]], [[RNA]] or [[antisense]] [[oligonucleotide]]s) and living microorganisms like [[virus]] and [[bacteria]] where the virulence of viruses and bacteria is reduced by the process of attenuation, they can be used for therapeutic or ''[[in vivo]]'' diagnostic purposes, and are produced by means other than direct extraction from a native (non-engineered) [[organism|biological]] source. [[Biologics]] are technically a subset of biopharmaceuticals, though the latter term is more likely to be used to refer to macromolecular products like protein-based and nucleic-acid-based drugs, while the term ''biologic'' is used more often when the medical product is composed of ''cellular or tissue'' based products (e.g. stored packed Red Blood Cell units).

==History==
The first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic 'human' [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]] technology.  Sometimes referred to as rHI, under the trade name [[Humulin]], was developed by [[Genentech]], but licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company]], who manufactured and marketed the product starting in 1982.

==Description==
The large majority of biopharmaceutical products are pharmaceuticals that are derived from life forms. Small molecule drugs are not typically regarded as biopharmaceutical in nature by the industry. However members of the press and the business and financial community often extend the definition to include pharmaceuticals not created through biotechnology. That is, the term has become an often-used [[buzzword]] for a variety of different companies producing new, apparently high-tech pharmaceutical products. Research and development investment in new medicines by the biopharmaceutical industry stood at $65.2bn in 2008.<ref>{{cite web

==Commercialization==
When a biopharmaceutical is developed, the company will typically apply for a patent, which is a grant for exclusive manufacturing rights. This is the primary means by which the developer of the drug can recover the investment cost for development of the biopharmaceutical. The patent laws in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] differ somewhat on the requirements for a patent, with the European requirements are perceived as more difficult to satisfy. The total number of patents granted for biopharmaceuticals has risen significantly since the 1970s. In 1978 the total patents granted was 30. This had climbed to 15,600 in 1995, and by 2001 there were 34,527 patent applications.<ref>{{cite web

==Regulation==
Within the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) exerts strict control over the commercial distribution of a pharmaceutical product, including biopharmaceuticals. Approval can require several years of clinical trials, including trials with human volunteers. Even after the drug is released, it will still be monitored for performance and safety risks.

The manufacture of the drug must satisfy the "current Good Manufacturing Practices" regulations of the FDA. They are typically manufactured in a [[clean room]] environment with set standards for the amount of airborne particles.

== Major kinds of biopharmaceuticals ==
*Blood factors ([[Factor VIII]] and [[Factor IX]])
*Thrombolytic agents ([[tissue plasminogen activator]])
*[[Hormones]] ([[insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, gonadotrophins)
*Haematopoietic growth factors ([[Erythropoietin]], [[colony stimulating factors]])
*[[Interferons]] (Interferons-α, -β, -γ)
*[[Interleukin]]-based products (Interleukin-2)
*[[Vaccines]] ([[Hepatitis B]] surface [[antigen]])
*[[Monoclonal antibodies]] (Various)
*Additional products ([[tumour necrosis factor]], therapeutic enzymes)

== Uses ==
*[[Erythropoietin]] - Treatment of [[anaemia]]
*[[Interferon-α]] - Treatment of [[leukaemia]]
*[[IFNB1|Interferon-β]] - Treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]]
*[[Monoclonal antibody]] - Treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
*Colony stimulating factors - Treatment of [[neutropenia]]
*[[Glucocerebrosidase]] - Treatment of [[Gaucher's disease]]

== Large scale production ==
Biopharmaceuticals may be produced from microbial cells (e.g. [[Escherichia coli|recombinant ''E. coli'']] or yeast cultures), mammalian cell lines (see [[cell culture]]) and plant cell cultures (see [[plant tissue culture]]) and [[moss]] plants in [[bioreactor]]s of various configurations, including [[photo-bioreactors]].<ref>Eva L. Decker und [[Ralf Reski]] (2008): Current
achievements in the production of complex biopharmaceuticals with moss bioreactor. Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering 31, 3-9. {{DOI|10.1007/s00449-007-0151-y}}</ref>

Important issues of concern are cost of production (a low volume, high purity product is desirable) and microbial contamination (by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[mycoplasma]], etc.). Alternative platforms of production which are being tested include whole plants ([[plant-made pharmaceuticals]]).

===Transgenics===
{{main|Pharming (genetics)}}
A potentially controversial method of producing biopharmaceuticals involves [[transgenic]] organisms, particularly plants and animals that have been genetically modified to produce drugs. The production of these organisms represents a significant risk on the part of the investor, both in terms of the risk of failure to produce the required organism, and in the risk of non-acceptance by government bodies due to the perceived risks and from ethical issues. Biopharmaceutical crops also represent a risk of cross-contamination with non-engineered crops, or crops engineered for non-medical purposes.

One potential approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk (or blood or urine). Once an animal is produced, typically using the [[pronuclear microinjection]] method, it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome.<ref>{{cite journal
