The '''cardiac skeleton''', sometimes called the '''fibrous skeleton of the heart''', is the structure of [[dense connective tissue]] in the [[heart]] that separates the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] from the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. The cardiac skeleton establishes electrically impermeable boundaries to autonomic influence within the heart. The anchored [[Collagen]] framework of four valves in a plane has the unique property of being electrically inert. In normal anatomy the AV node is the only electrical conduit from the atria to the ventricles through the cardiac skeleton.

==General form and anatomy==
The cardiac skeleton consists of four dense bands of dense connective tissue that encircle the bases of the pulmonary trunk, aorta, and heart valves.<ref>''Martini Anatomy and Physiology, 5th ed.''
</ref> While not a "true" [[skeleton]], it does provide structure and support for the heart, as well as isolating the atria from the ventricles. In youth, this collagen structure is free of calcium adhesions and is quite flexible. With aging some calcium  can accumulate on this skeleton. This accumulation contributes to the [[AV node]] and [[AV bundle]] delay of the depolarisation wave in geriatric patients.<ref name="Gray">{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Henry|title=Gray's Anatomy|edition=1918|year=1918|publisher=Longmans|location=London|chapter=The Heart|isbn=613-0-24743-5}}</ref>

The right and left '''fibrous rings of heart''' (''anulus fibrosus cordis'') surround the [[atrioventricular]] and arterial orifices, and are decidedly stronger upon the left than on the right side of the [[heart]]. Physiologically, this is readily appreciated in light of the pressure differential between the right and left circuits. The right fibrous ring is known as the ''anulus fibrosus dexter cordis'', and the left is known as the ''anulus fibrosus sinister cordis''.<ref name="Gray" />

The upper chambers ([[Atrium (heart)|atria]]) and lower ([[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]) are electrically divided by the properties of [[collagen]] proteins within the rings. The valve rings, central body and skeleton of the heart consisting of collagen are impermeable to electrical propagation. The only channel allowed (barring accessory/rare preexcitation channels) through this collagen barrier is represented by a sinus that opens up to the [[Atrioventricular node]] and exits to the [[Bundle of His]]. The muscle origins/insertions of many of the [[cardiomyocyte]]s are anchored to opposite sides of the valve rings.<ref name="Gray" />

The atrioventricular rings serve for the attachment of the muscular fibers of the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], and for the attachment of the [[bicuspid]] and [[tricuspid valve]]s.<ref name="Gray" />

The left atrioventricular ring is closely connected, by its right margin, with the aortic arterial ring; between these and the right atrioventricular ring is a triangular mass of fibrous tissue, the Fibrous trigone, which represents the ''os cordis'' seen in the heart of some of the larger animals, as the [[ox]] and [[elephant]].<ref name="Gray" />

Lastly, there is the tendinous band, already referred to, the posterior surface of the [[conus arteriosus]].<ref name="Gray" />

The fibrous rings surrounding the arterial orifices serve for the attachment of the great vessels and [[semilunar valves]], they are known as The ''aortic annulus''.<ref name="Gray" />

Each ring receives, by its ventricular margin, the attachment of some of the muscular fibers of the ventricles; its opposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, to which the middle coat of the [[artery]] is firmly fixed.<ref name="Gray" />

The attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring is strengthened by the external coat and serous membrane externally, and by the [[endocardium]] internally.<ref name="Gray" />

From the margins of the semicircular notches the fibrous structure of the ring is continued into the segments of the valves.<ref name="Gray" />

The middle coat of the artery in this situation is thin, and the vessel is dilated to form the sinuses of the aorta and pulmonary artery.<ref name="Gray" />
