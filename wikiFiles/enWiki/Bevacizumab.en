'''Bevacizumab''' (trade name '''Avastin''', [[Genentech]]/[[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]]) is an [[angiogenesis inhibitor]], a drug that slows [[angiogenesis|the growth of new blood vessels]]. It is licensed to treat various cancers, including colorectal, lung, breast (outside the USA), glioblastoma (USA only), kidney and ovarian.

Bevacizumab is a humanized [[monoclonal antibody]] that inhibits [[vascular endothelial growth factor A]] (VEGF-A).<ref name=Los>{{cite journal |pages=443–50 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.12-4-443 |title=Target Practice: Lessons from Phase III Trials with Bevacizumab and Vatalanib in the Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer |year=2007 |last1=Los |first1=M. |last2=Roodhart |first2=J.

Bevacizumab was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for certain  [[metastasis|metastatic]] cancers. It received its first approval in 2004, for combination use with standard [[chemotherapy]] for metastatic [[colon cancer]].<ref>http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/pdf/avastin-prescribing.pdf</ref> It has since been approved for use in certain lung cancers, renal cancers, and [[glioblastoma multiforme]] of the brain.

FDA approval is required for Genentech to market a drug for that indication. Doctors may sometimes prescribe it for that indication, although insurance companies are less likely to pay for it.<ref name="NYT2011"/> The drug remains approved for breast cancer use in other countries including Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/22/2960728.htm|title=Breast cancer drug 'still safe' for Aussie women|word=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=July 22, 2010}}</ref> 

Clinical trials are underway for many other indications including ovarian cancer, pediatric osteosarcoma, and certain non-malignant eye diseases. In the curative setting ([[adjuvant therapy]]), clinical studies are underway in breast cancer and lung cancer.

==Background==

Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and was the first commercially available angiogenesis inhibitor. Its main action is the inhibition of the function of a natural protein called [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) that stimulates new blood vessel formation. Because most malignant tumors are highly dependant on angiogenesis it was expected that Bevacizumab can stop or delay growth of tumors.  Bevacizumab binds directly to VEGF to form a protein complex which is incapable of further binding to VEGF receptor sites (which would initiate vessel growth) effectively reducing available VEGF.  The Bevacizumab/VEGF complex is both metabolized and excreted directly.

==Indications==

=== Colorectal cancer ===
Bevacizumab was approved by the FDA in February 2004 for use in metastatic [[colorectal cancer]] when used with standard chemotherapy treatment (as first-line treatment) and with 5-fluorouracil-based therapy for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. This recommendation was based on the E3200 trial — addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin/5-FU/leucovorin (FOLFOX4) therapy.

In adjuvant colon cancer, data from two large randomized studies have shown no significant benefit and a potential to cause harm in this setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/29/1/1.full |title=Lessons From the Adjuvant Bevacizumab Trial on Colon Cancer: What Next? |publisher=Jco.ascopubs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>

It was approved by the [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]] in January 2005 for use in [[colorectal cancer]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Lung cancer ===
In 2006, the FDA approved bevacizumab for use in first-line advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. The approval was based on the pivotal study E4599 (conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), which demonstrated a 2-month improvement in overall survival in patients treated with bevacizumab (Sandler, et al. NEJM 2004). A preplanned analysis of histology in E4599 demonstrated a 4-month median survival benefit with bevacizumab for patients with adenocarcinoma (Sandler, et al. JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.

A subsequent European clinical trial, AVAiL, was first reported in 2009 and confirmed the significant improvement in progression-free survival shown in E4599 (Reck, et al. Ann. Oncol. 2010). An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). As an anti-angiogenic agent, there is no mechanistic rationale for stopping bevacizumab before disease progression. Stated another way, the survival benefits achieved with bevacizumab can only be expected when used in accordance with the clinical evidence: continued until disease progression or treatment-limiting side effects.

Another large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al. ECCM 2011). First-line patients were treated with bevacizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles, and then randomized to receive maintenance treatment with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed demonstrated a 50% reduction in risk of progression vs bevacizumab alone (median PFS: 10.2 vs 6.6 months, HR 0.50, p<0.001).

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends bevacizumab as standard first-line treatment in combination with any platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab until disease progression. Bevacizumab is given as an intravenous infusion every three weeks at the dose of either 15&nbsp;mg/kg or 7.5&nbsp;mg/kg. The higher dose is usually given with carboplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas the lower dose is usually given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

=== Breast cancer ===
In December 2010, the FDA removed the breast cancer indication from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in breast cancer patients. The combined data from four different clinical trials showed that bevacizumab neither prolonged overall survival nor slowed disease progression sufficiently to outweigh the risk it presents to patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer. Doctors are free to prescribe bevacizumab off label, although insurance companies are less likely to approve off-label treatments.<ref name="FDA breast1">{{cite press release

A panel of cancer experts ruled for a second time that Avastin, the best-selling cancer drug in the world, should no longer be used in breast cancer patients, clearing the way for the U.S. government to remove its endorsement from the drug. The June 2011 meeting of the FDA's oncologic drug advisory committee was the last step in an appeal by the drug's maker.  The committee concluded that breast cancer clinical studies of patients taking Avastin have shown no advantage in survival rates, no improvement in quality of life, and significant side effects.

On October 11, 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that the agency is revoking the agency’s approval of the breast cancer indication for Avastin  (bevacizumab) after concluding that the drug has not been shown to be safe and effective for that use.
 
Avastin will still remain on the market as an approved treatment for certain types of colon, lung, kidney and brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme).<ref>{{cite press release |title=FDA Commissioner announces Avastin decision Drug not to be safe and effective in breast cancer patients |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm280536.htm |date=November 18, 2011 }}</ref>

==== History relating to breast cancer ====
In 2010, before the FDA announcement, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Breast Cancer to affirm the recommendation regarding the use of bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech/Roche) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2008, the FDA approved Bevacizumab for use in [[breast cancer]]. A panel of outside advisers voted 5 to 4 against approval, but their recommendations were overruled. The panel expressed concern that data from the clinical trial did not show any increase in quality of life or prolonging of life for patients — two important benchmarks for late-stage [[cancer]] treatments. The [[clinical trial]] did show that bevacizumab reduced tumor volumes and showed an increase in [[Progression Free Survival|progression free survival time]].  It was based on this data that the FDA chose to overrule the recommendation of the panel of advisers. This decision was lauded by patient advocacy groups and some oncologists. Other oncologists felt that granting approval for late-stage cancer therapies that did not prolong or increase the quality of life for patients would give license to [[pharmaceutical companies]] to ignore these important benchmarks when developing new late-stage cancer therapies.<ref name=nytimesref />

===Uses in eye disease===

Many diseases of the eye, such as [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD) and [[diabetic retinopathy]], damage the [[retina]] and cause blindness when blood vessels around the retina grow abnormally and leak fluid, causing the layers of the retina to separate. This abnormal growth is caused by VEGF, so bevacizumab has been successfully used to inhibit VEGF and slow this growth.

Bevacizumab has recently been used by ophthalmologists in an [[off-label use]] as an [[vitreous humour|intravitreal agent]] in the treatment of proliferative (neovascular) eye diseases, particularly for [[choroidal neovascularization|choroidal neovascular membrane]] (CNV) in AMD. Although not currently approved by the FDA for such use, the injection of 1.25-2.5&nbsp;mg of bevacizumab into the vitreous cavity has been performed without significant intraocular toxicity.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Arevalo, JF et al. | year = 2008 | title = Primary intravitreal bevacizumab for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degenation: results of the Pan-American Collaborative Retina Study Group at 12 months follow up | journal = Retina | volume = 10 | pages = 1387–94 | pmid = 18827735 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.1097/IAE.0b013e3181884ff4}}</ref> Many retina specialists have noted impressive results in the setting of CNV, proliferative [[diabetic retinopathy]], [[neovascular glaucoma]], diabetic [[macular edema]], [[retinopathy of prematurity]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.33057 |title=Intravitreal bevacizumab in aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity |year=2007 |last1=Azad |first1=Rajvardhan |last2=Chandra |first2=Parijat |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=55 |issue=4 |page=319 |pmid=17595491}}</ref> and macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusions.

[[Ranibizumab]], a [[Fragment antigen binding|Fab fragment]] derived from the same parent molecule as bevacizumab, has been developed by Genentech (by the same scientist [[Napoleone Ferrara]]) for intraocular use. This drug, under the trade name '''Lucentis''', now has FDA approval. It has undergone extensive clinical trials. Reports{{who|date=April 2012}} indicate substantially better outcomes in patients treated with intravitreal Lucentis than conventional treatments in people with [[choroidal neovascularization]] (wet age related macular degeneration). Most patients with choroidal neovascularization lose vision or at best maintain vision despite treatment with laser, photodynamic therapy or Macugen. A much larger proportion (up to 70%) gained vision with Lucentis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

When bevacizumab is used in the treatment of macular degeneration, only tiny and relatively inexpensive doses (compared to amounts used in colon and other cancers)  are required.  Some investigators believe that bevacizumab at a cost of around $42 a dose is as effective as ranibizumab at a cost of over $1,593 a dose.<ref>{{cite news |title=Medicare Eye Study Finds Untapped Savings |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703513604575311070894017154.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.c2459 |title=Bevacizumab for neovascular age related macular degeneration (ABC Trial): multicentre randomised double masked study |year=2010 |last1=Tufail |first1=A. |last2=Patel |first2=P.

The primary pharmacokinetic difference between intraocular Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab is the very large difference in systemic half-lives, i.e. 2 hours for Ranibizumab versus 20 days for Bevacizumab.  Since Bevacizumab was designed as a cancer treatment, the long systemic half-life is considered to be a positive feature (allowing greater exposure time of the tumor to the drug), while the same long half-life is a negative feature in intraocular treatment, since it has no benefit outside of the eye and may in fact be detrimental.  Although the systemic exposure with both drugs is very low, Ranibizumab has a much lower average systemic exposure ([[area under the curve]]), so it may be conjectured to have a commensurately lesser chance of systemic adverse events.  

The [[National Eye Institute]] (NEI) of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) announced in October 2006 that it would fund a comparative study trial of ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin) to assess the relative safety and effectiveness in treating AMD.<ref>http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/wais/bold032001.pl?A_08-EI-0061.html</ref> This study, called the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trials (CATT Study), enrolled about 1,200 patients with newly diagnosed wet AMD, randomly assigning the patients to one of four treatment groups.<ref>http://irvaronsjournal.blogspot.com/2007/09/catt-study-update-3-avastin-vs-lucentis.html{{Unreliable medical source|date=July 2011}}</ref> The CATT Study was conducted at 47 clinical sites throughout the United States, following the patients for 2 years.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00593450|Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials: Lucentis-Avastin Trial}}</ref> Initial results of the study showing essentially similar outcomes using either drug at one year were formally published after peer review in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' on May 19, 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1102673|title=Ranibizumab and Bevacizumab for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration|year=2011|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=364|issue=20|pages=1897–1908|pmid=21526923|last1=Martin|first1=DF|last2=Maguire|first2=MG|last3=Ying|first3=GS|last4=Grunwald|first4=JE|last5=Fine|first5=SL|last6=Jaffe|first6=GJ|pmc=3157322|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1102673#t=articleBackground|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}</ref> Similar results in this cohort were maintained at two years, with bevacizumab showing no inferiority to ranibizumab, although a statistically non-significant trend to improved visual outcomes from injections given monthly rather than as required was noted with both drugs.<ref>{{Cite PMID|22555112}}</ref>

==Drug administration==
Bevacizumab is usually given intravenously every 14 days. In colon cancer, it is given in combination with the chemotherapy drug 5-FU ([[5-fluorouracil]]), [[leucovorin]], and [[oxaliplatin]] or [[irinotecan]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Clinical trials are underway to test an intra-arterial technique for delivering the drug directly to brain tumors, bypassing the blood–brain barrier.<ref name = "BBB" /><ref>{{cite news |title=World's first delivery of intra-arterial Avastin directly into brain tumor |newspaper=SAWF News |date=November 17, 2009 |url=http://www.sawfnews.com/Health/61214.aspx}}</ref> For treatment of eye diseases it is injected intravitreously.

==Concerns==

===Adverse effects===
Bevacizumab inhibits the growth of blood vessels, which is part of the body's normal healing and maintenance. The body grows new blood vessels in [[wound healing]], and as [[collateral circulation]] around blocked or [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] blood vessels. One concern is that bevacizumab will interfere with these normal processes, and worsen conditions like [[coronary artery disease]] or [[peripheral artery disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Semenza GL |title=A new weapon for attacking tumor blood vessels |journal=N.

The main side effects are [[hypertension]] and heightened risk of [[bleeding]]. [[Bowel perforation]] has been reported.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803880|last1=Sliesoriaitis|first1=S|last2=Tawfik|first2=B|title=Bevacizumab-induced bowel perforation. |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume=111 |issue=7 |pages=437-44 |year=2011 |month=July |pmid=21803880}}</ref> In advanced lung cancer, less than half of patients qualify for treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01243894-200606000-00023 |title=The Proportion of Patients with Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Potentially Eligible for Treatment with Bevacizumab: A Single Institutional Survey |year=2006 |last1=Velcheti |first1=Vamsidhar |last2=Viswanathan |first2=Avinash |last3=Govindan |first3=Ramaswamy |journal=Journal of Thoracic Oncology |volume=1 |issue=5 |page=501 |pmid=17409907}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=86–91 |doi=10.1007/s11912-008-0013-z |title=Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in cancer |year=2008 |last1=Vaughn |first1=Christopher |last2=Zhang |first2=Louann |last3=Schiff |first3=David |journal=Current Oncology Reports |volume=10 |pmid=18366965 |issue=1}}</ref> [[Nasal septum perforation]] and renal [[thrombotic microangiopathy]] have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0707330 |title=VEGF Inhibition and Renal Thrombotic Microangiopathy |year=2008 |last1=Eremina |first1=Vera |last2=Jefferson |first2=J.

In 2013, Hoffmann-La Roche announced that the drug was associated with 52 cases of [[necrotizing fasciitis]] from 1997 to 2012, of which 17 patients died.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2013/05/02/avastin-flesh-eating-disease.html|title=Cancer drug Avastin tied to 2 cases of flesh-eating disease in Canada|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2 May 2013|accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref> About 2/3 of cases involved patients with [[colorectal cancer]], or patients with [[gastrointestinal perforation]]s or [[fistula]]s.

These effects are largely avoided in [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] use since the drug is introduced directly into the eye thus minimizing any effects on the rest of the body.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Costs===
The media have criticized the high cost of a drug that does not cure cancer{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} but only prolongs life{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In countries with national health care systems (such as the UK and Canada), many of those national health services have restricted on the basis of cost-benefit calculations; in the U.K., for example, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] has taken the public position that bevacizumab should not be funded by the NHS because it costs nearly £21,000 per patient but has only limited usage in cancer treatment because it merely extends life rather than providing a cure.<ref name="BBCReport">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11060968 |title=Critics condemn bowel cancer drug rejection| author=Briggs, Helen (BBC News Health Reporter)| accessdate=2010-08-24|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> In 2006 the Scottish Medicines Consortium recommended against the NHS funding Avastin for first-line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, due to estimated costs of £24,000 to £93,000 per [[quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bevacizumab|url=http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/files/bevacizumab__Avastin__Resubmissionn_May_06_FINAL_for_website.pdf|publisher=Scottish Medicines|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> 

Though Genentech has adjusted the price for patients in certain situations,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Genentech continues to insist that the benefit is worth the cost, and the medication's high cost helps cover the cost of the expensive and risky research needed to develop new drugs.

The addition of bevacizumab to standard treatment can prolong the lives of breast and lung cancer patients by several months, at a cost of $100,000 a year in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |author=Berenson, Alex |title=A Cancer Drug Shows Promise, at a Price That Many Can't Pay |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 15, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/business/15drug.html}}</ref> For [[colorectal cancer]], Robert J. Mayer wrote in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] that bevacizumab extended life by 4.7 months (20.3 months vs. 15.6 months) in the initial study, at a cost of $42,800 to $55,000.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMe048098 |title=Two Steps Forward in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer |year=2004 |last1=Mayer |first1=Robert J. |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=350 |issue=23 |pages=2406–8 |pmid=15175443}}</ref> Costs in other countries vary; in Canada it is reported to cost $40,000 CAD per year.<ref>{{cite news |title=P.E.I. sole holdout on cancer drug |newspaper=CBC News |date=November 26, 2009 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2009/11/26/pei-avastin-stein-currie-584.html}}</ref>

==Counterfeit==
On Tuesday, February 14, 2012 Roche and its U.S. biotech unit Genentech announced that counterfeit Avastin had been distributed in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/us-counterfeits-cancer-drug-avastin-foun-idUSTRE81E1TK20120215 | work=Reuters | title=Counterfeits of cancer drug Avastin found in U.S | date=February 15, 2012}}</ref>  The investigation is ongoing, and differences in the outer packaging make identification of the bogus drugs simple for medical providers.  Roche analyzed three bogus vials of Avastin and found they contained [[salt]], [[starch]], [[citrate]], [[isopropanol]], [[propanediol]], [[t-butanol]], [[benzoic acid]], di-fluorinated benzene ring, [[acetone]] and [[phthalate]] moiety, but no active ingredients of the cancer drug.   According to Roche, the levels of the chemicals were not consistent therefore whether the chemicals were at harmful concentrations could not be determined.  The counterfeit Avastin has been traced back to Egypt and it entered the legitimate supply chains via Europe to United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/27/us-avastin-idUKTRE81Q29X20120227|title=Fake Avastin had salt, starch, chemicals:Roche|author=Berkrot, Bill|publisher=Reuters|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/phony-avastin-vials-contained-chemicals-no-drugs/2012-02-28|title=Phony Avastin vials contained chemicals, but no drugs|author=Staton, Tracy|publisher=FiercePharma.com|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>
