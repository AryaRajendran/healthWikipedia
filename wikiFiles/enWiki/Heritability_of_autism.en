The '''heritability of autism''' is the proportion of [[autism]] that can be explained by [[genetic variation]]; if the [[heritability]] of a condition is high, then the condition is considered to be primarily genetic.

==Twin studies==
[[Twin studies]] are a helpful tool in determining the [[heritability]] of disorders and human traits in general. They involve determining concordance of characteristics between identical ([[monozygotic]] or MZ) twins and between fraternal ([[dizygotic]] or DZ) twins. Possible problems of twin studies are: (1) errors in diagnosis of monozygocity, and (2) the assumption that social environment sharing by DZ twins is equivalent to that of MZ twins.

A condition that is environmentally caused without genetic involvement would yield a concordance for MZ twins equal to the concordance found for DZ twins.  In contrast, a condition that is completely genetic in origin would theoretically yield a concordance of 100% for MZ pairs and usually much less for DZ pairs depending on factors such as the number of genes involved and [[assortative mating]].

An example of a condition that appears to have very little if any genetic influence is [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), with a concordance of 28% vs. 27% for MZ and DZ pairs respectively.<ref name=genetics1>{{vcite journal |author=Mohammed I, Cherkas LF, Riley SA, Spector TD, Trudgill NJ |title=Genetic influences in irritable bowel syndrome: a twin study |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=100 |issue=6 |pages=1340–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15929767 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.41700.x}}</ref> An

Notable twin studies have attempted to shed light on the
heritability of autism.

A small scale study in 1977 was the first of its kind to look into the heritability of autism. It involved 10 DZ and 11 MZ pairs in which at least one twin in each pair showed infantile autism. It found a concordance of 36% in MZ twins compared to 0% for DZ twins. Concordance of "cognitive abnormalities" was 82% in MZ pairs and 10% for DZ pairs. In 12 of the 17 pairs discordant for autism, a biological hazard was believed to be associated with the condition.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Folstein S, Rutter M |title=Infantile autism: a genetic study of 21 twin pairs |journal=Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=297–321 |year=1977 |pmid=562353 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1977.tb00443.x}}</ref>

A 1979 case report discussed a pair of identical twins concordant for autism. The twins developed similarly until the age of 4, when one of them spontaneously improved. The other twin, who had suffered infrequent seizures, remained autistic. The report noted that genetic factors were not "all important" in the development of the twins.<ref name=genetics3>{{vcite journal |author=Wessels WH, Pompe van Meerdervoort M |title=Monozygotic twins with early infantile autism.

In 1985, a study of twins enrolled with the UCLA Registry for Genetic Studies found a concordance of 95.7% for autism in 23 pairs of MZ twins, and 23.5% for 17 DZ twins.<ref name=genetics4>{{vcite journal |author=Ritvo ER, Freeman BJ, Mason-Brothers A, Mo A, Ritvo AM |title=Concordance for the syndrome of autism in 40 pairs of afflicted twins |journal=The American journal of psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=74–7 |year=1985 |pmid=4038442 |doi=}}</ref>

In a 1989 study, [[Nordic countries]] were screened for cases of autism. Eleven pairs of MZ twins and 10 of DZ twins were examined. Concordance of autism was found to be 91% in MZ and 0% in DZ pairs. The concordances for "cognitive disorder" were 91% and 30% respectively. In most of the pairs discordant for autism, the autistic twin had more perinatal stress.<ref name=genetics5>{{vcite journal |author=Steffenburg S, Gillberg C, Hellgren L, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=A twin study of autism in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden |journal=Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=405–16 |year=1989 |pmid=2745591 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1989.tb00254.x}}</ref>

A British twin sample was reexamined in 1995 and a 60% concordance was found for autism in MZ twins vs. 0% concordance for DZ. It also found 92% concordance for a broader spectrum in MZ vs. 10% for DZ. The study concluded that "obstetric hazards usually appear to be consequences of genetically influenced abnormal development, rather than independent aetiological factors."<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bailey A, Le Couteur A, Gottesman I, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Autism as a strongly genetic disorder: evidence from a British twin study |journal=Psychological medicine |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=63–77 |year=1995 |pmid=7792363 |doi=10.1017/S0033291700028099}}</ref>

A 1999 study looked at social cognitive skills in general-population children and adolescents.

In 2000, a study looked at reciprocal social behavior in general-population identical twins. It found a concordance of 73% for MZ, i.e. "highly heritable", and 37% for DZ pairs.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Constantino JN, Todd RD |title=Genetic structure of reciprocal social behavior |journal=The American journal of psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=12 |pages=2043–5 |year=2000 |pmid=11097975 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.12.2043}}</ref>

A 2004 study looked at 16 MZ twins and found a concordance of 43.75% for "strictly defined autism". Neuroanatomical differences (discordant cerebellar white and grey matter volumes) between discordant twins were found.  The abstract notes that in previous studies 75% of the non-autistic twins displayed the broader [[phenotype]].<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kates WR, Burnette CP, Eliez S, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Neuroanatomic variation in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the narrow phenotype for autism |journal=The American journal of psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=3 |pages=539–46 |year=2004 |pmid=14992981 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.3.539}}</ref>

Another 2004 study examined whether the characteristic symptoms of autism (impaired social interaction, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors) show decreased variance of symptoms among [[monozygotic]] twins compared to siblings in a sample of 16 families. The study demonstrated significant aggregation of symptoms in twins. It also concluded that "the levels of clinical features seen in autism may be a result of mainly independent genetic traits."<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kolevzon A, Smith CJ, Schmeidler J, Buxbaum JD, Silverman JM |title=Familial symptom domains in monozygotic siblings with autism |journal=Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet |volume=129 |issue=1 |pages=76–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15274045 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.30011}}</ref>

==Sibling studies==
The importance of sibling studies lies in contrasting their results to those of fraternal (DZ) twin studies, plus their sample sizes can be much larger. Environment sharing by siblings is presumably different enough to that of DZ twins to shed some light on the magnitude of environmental influence. This should even be true to some extent regarding the prenatal environment. Unfortunately DZ twin study findings have yielded a very large range of variance and are error prone because of the apparent low concordance and the fact that they typically look at a small number of DZ pairs. For example, in studies involving 10 DZ pairs, a concordance below 10% would be impossible to determine precisely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

A study of 31 siblings of autistic children, 32 siblings of children with developmental delay, and 32 controls.

A 2005 Danish study looked at "data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and the Danish Civil Registration System to study some risk factors of autism, including place of birth, parental place of birth, parental age, family history of psychiatric disorders, and paternal identity."  It found an overall prevalence rate of roughly 0.08%. Prevalence of autism in siblings of autistic children was found to be 1.76%. Prevalence of autism among siblings of children with [[Asperger syndrome]] or [[PDD]] was found to be 1.04%. The risk was twice as high if the mother had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. The study also found that "the risk of autism was associated with increasing degree of urbanisation of the child's place of birth and with increasing paternal, but not maternal, age."<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Lauritsen MB, Pedersen CB, Mortensen PB |title=Effects of familial risk factors and place of birth on the risk of autism: a nationwide register-based study |journal=Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=963–71 |year=2005 |pmid=16108999 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00391.x}}</ref>

A study in 2007 looked at a database containing pedigrees of 86 families with two or more autistic children and found that 42 of the third-born male children showed autistic symptoms, suggesting that parents had a 50% chance of passing on a mutation to their offspring. The mathematical models suggest that about 50% of autistic cases are caused by spontaneous mutations. The simplest model was to divide parents into two risk classes depending on whether the parent carries a pre-existing mutation that causes autism; it suggested that about a quarter of autistic children have inherited a [[copy number variation]] from their parents.<ref name=Zhao>{{vcite journal |author=Zhao X, Leotta A, Kustanovich V, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=A unified genetic theory for sporadic and inherited autism |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=104 |issue=31 |pages=12831–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17652511 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0705803104|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/31/12831|laysummary=http://www.cshl.edu/public/releases/07_new_autism_model.html|laysource=CSHL|laydate=2007-07-23}}</ref>

in the development of autism, presumably due to perinatal factors.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Greenberg DA, Hodge SE, Sowinski J, Nicoll D |title=Excess of twins among affected sibling pairs with autism: implications for the etiology of autism |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=1062–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11590546 |doi=10.1086/324191}}</ref>  However, three large-scale epidemiological studies have refuted this idea.<ref name=Freitag>{{vcite journal |author= Freitag CM |title= The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal= Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 |url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n1/full/4001896a.html}}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal |author=Hallmayer J, Glasson EJ, Bower C, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=On the twin risk in autism |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=941–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12297988 |doi=10.1086/342990}}</ref>

==Proposed models==
Twin and family studies show that autism is a highly heritable condition, but they have left many questions for researchers, most notably

* Why is fraternal twin concordance so low considering that identical twin concordance is high?
* Why are parents of autistic children typically non-autistic?
* Which factors could be involved in the failure to find a 100% concordance in identical twins?
* Is profound mental retardation a characteristic of the [[genotype]] or something totally independent?

Some researchers{{Who|date=April 2012}} have speculated that what we currently refer to as "autism" may be a catch-all description for many yet unknown conditions with different genetic and/or environmental etiologies. This would appear to make the effort to find a [[genotype]] model a lot more difficult, and perhaps even pointless.  Nevertheless, a number of genetic models have been proposed to try to explain the results of twin and sibling studies.

===Single genes===

Autism sometimes arises from rare single-gene neurodevelopmental disorders such as [[fragile X syndrome]] and [[22q13 deletion syndrome]]. These syndromes are associated with different gene mutations and, it is assumed, different mechanisms.<ref name=Levitt-Campbell>{{vcite journal |author= Levitt P, Campbell DB |title= The genetic and neurobiologic compass points toward common signaling dysfunctions in autism spectrum disorders |journal= J Clin Invest |volume=119 |issue=4 |pages=747–54 |year=2009 |pmid=19339766 |doi=10.1172/JCI37934}}</ref>

===Multigene interactions===

In this model, autism often arises from a combination of common, functional variants of genes. Each gene contributes a relatively small effect in increasing the risk of autism. In this model, no single gene directly regulates any core symptom of autism such as social behavior. Instead, each gene encodes a protein that disrupts a cellular process, and the combination of these disruptions, possibly together with environmental influences, affect key developmental processes such as [[synapse]] formation. For example, one model is that many mutations converge on disruption of [[MAPK/ERK pathway|ERK]] and [[PI3K]] signaling, which in turn affect [[c-MET|MET]] and other [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s.<ref name=Levitt-Campbell/>

===Two family types===
In this model most families fall into two types: in the majority, sons have a low risk of autism, but in a small minority their risk is near 50%. In the low-risk families, sporadic autism is mainly caused by spontaneous [[mutation]] with poor [[penetrance]] in daughters and high penetrance in sons. The high-risk families come from (mostly female) children who carry a new causative mutation but are unaffected and transmit the dominant mutation to grandchildren.<ref name=Zhao/>

===Epigenetic===
Several [[epigenetic]] models of autism have been proposed.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Jiang YH, Sahoo T, Michaelis RC, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=A mixed epigenetic/genetic model for oligogenic inheritance of autism with a limited role for UBE3A |journal=Am J Med Genet A |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2004 |pmid=15389703 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.30297}}</ref> These are suggested by the occurrence of autism in individuals with fragile X syndrome, which arises from epigenetic mutations, and with Rett syndrome, which involves epigenetic regulatory factors. An epigenetic model would help explain why standard genetic screening strategies have so much difficulty with autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Hum Mol Genet |date=2006 |volume=15 |issue= Review 2 |pages=R138–50 |title= Epigenetics of autism spectrum disorders |author= Schanen NC |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl213 |pmid=16987877 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/suppl_2/R138}}</ref>

===Genomic imprinting===
[[Genomic imprinting]] models have been proposed; one of their strengths is explaining the high male-to-female ratio in ASD.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Skuse DH |title=Imprinting, the X-chromosome, and the male brain: explaining sex differences in the liability to autism |journal=Pediatr Res |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |year=2000 |pmid=10625077 |doi=10.1203/00006450-200001000-00006}}</ref> One hypothesis is that autism is in some sense diametrically opposite to [[schizophrenia]] and other psychotic-spectrum conditions, that alterations of genomic imprinting help to mediate the development of these two sets of conditions, and that ASD involves increased effects of paternally expressed genes, which regulate overgrowth in the brain, whereas schizophrenia involves maternally expressed genes and undergrowth.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Behav Brain Sci |date=2008 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=241–61 |title= Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain |author= Crespi B, Badcock C |doi=10.1017/S0140525X08004214 |pmid=18578904}}</ref>

===Environmental interactions===
Though autism's genetic factors explain most of autism risk, they do not explain all of it. A common hypothesis is that autism is caused by the interaction of a genetic predisposition and an early environmental insult.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Trottier G, Srivastava L, Walker CD |title= Etiology of infantile autism: a review of recent advances in genetic and neurobiological research |journal= J Psychiatry Neurosci |year=1999 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=103–115 |pmid=10212552 |pmc=1188990}}</ref> Several theories based on environmental factors have been proposed to address the remaining risk. Some of these theories focus on prenatal environmental factors, such as agents that cause birth defects; others focus on the environment after birth, such as children's diets. All known [[teratogen]]s (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.<ref name=Arndt>{{vcite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |date=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–99 |title= The teratology of autism |author= Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245}}</ref> Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies,<ref>{{vcite journal |author= [[Professor Sir Michael Rutter|Rutter M]] |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |date=2005 |pages=2–15 |pmid=15858952 |doi= 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x}}</ref> extensive searches are underway.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |date=2006 |volume=114 |issue=7 |pages=A412–8 |title= Tracing the origins of autism: a spectrum of new studies |author= Szpir M |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/114-7/focus.html |pmid=16835042 |doi=10.1289/ehp.114-a412 |pmc=1513312}}</ref>

==Candidate gene loci==
Known genetic syndromes, mutations, and metabolic diseases account for up to 20% of autism cases.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Benvenuto A, Manzi B, Alessandrelli R, Galasso C, Curatolo P |title=Recent advances in the pathogenesis of syndromic autisms |journal=Int J Pediatr |volume=2009 |issue= |pages=198736 |year=2009 |pmid=19946417 |pmc=2778501 |doi=10.1155/2009/198736 |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijped/2009/198736.html }}</ref> A number of [[allele]]s have been shown to have strong linkage to the autism [[phenotype]]. In many cases the findings are inconclusive, with some studies showing no linkage. Alleles linked so far strongly support the assertion that there is a large number of [[genotype]]s that are
manifested as the autism [[phenotype]]. At least some of the alleles associated with autism are fairly prevalent in the general population, which indicates they are not rare pathogenic mutations. This also presents some challenges in identifying all the rare allele ''combinations'' involved in the etiology of autism.

A 2008 study compared genes linked with autism to those of other neurological diseases, and found that more than half of known autism genes are implicated in other disorders, suggesting that the other disorders may share molecular mechanisms with autism.<ref>{{vcite journal |author= Wall DP, Esteban FJ, Deluca TF ''et al.'' |author.= |title= Comparative analysis of neurological disorders focuses genome-wide search for autism genes |journal=Genomics |volume= 93|issue=2 |pages= 120–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18950700 |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2008.09.015}}</ref>

Mutations in the SHANK3 gene have been strongly associated with the autism spectrum disorders. If the SHANK3 gene is not adequately passed to a child from the parent ([[haploinsufficiency]]) there will possibly be significant neurological changes that are associated with yet another gene, 22q13, which interacts with SHANK3. Alteration or deletion of either will effect changes in the other.<ref name="orpha"/>

A deletion of a single copy of a gene on [[Chromosome 22 (human)|chromosome 22q13]] has been correlated with global developmental delay, severely delayed speech or social communication disorders and moderate to profound delay of cognitive abilities. Behavior is described as "autistic-like" and includes high tolerance to pain and habitual chewing or mouthing<ref name="orpha"/> (see also [[22q13 deletion syndrome]]). This appears to be connected to the fact that signal transmission between nerve cells is altered with the absence of 22q13.

SHANK3 proteins also interact with neuroligins at the synapses of the brain further complicating the widespread effects of changes at the genetic level and beyond.<ref name="SHANK3">{{vcite journal |author=Durand CM, Betancur C, Boeckers TM, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are associated with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Nat Genet |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=25–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17173049 |doi=10.1038/ng1933|laysummary=http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science_news/shank3_mutations.php|laysource= [[Autism Speaks]]|accessdate=2007-11-07 |pmc=2082049}}</ref>

The objective of the study was to locate specific brain cells involved in autism to find regions in the [[genome]] linked to autism susceptibility [[genes]]. The focus of the research was [[copy number variation]]s (CNVs), extra or missing parts of genes. Each person does not actually have just an exact copy of genes from each parent. Each person also has occasional multiple copies of one or more genes or some genes are missing altogether. The research team attempted to locate CNVs when they scanned the DNA.

Neurexin 1 is one of the genes that may be involved in  communication between nerve cells ([[neurons]]).  Neurexin 1 and other genes like it are very important in determining how the brain is connected from cell to cell, and in the chemical transmission of information between nerve cells.  These genes are particularly active very early in brain development, either in utero or in the first months or couple of years of life. In some families their autistic child had only one copy of the neurexin 1 gene.

Besides actually locating yet another possible genetic influence (the findings were statistically insignificant), the research also reinforced the theory that autism involves many forms of genetic variations.

A 2008 study implicated the neurexin 1 gene in two independent subjects with ASD, and suggested that subtle changes to the gene might contribute to susceptibility to ASD.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal= Am J Hum Genet |date=2008 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=199–207 |title= Disruption of neurexin 1 associated with autism spectrum disorder |author= Kim HG, Kishikawa S, Higgins AW ''et al.'' |author.= |pmid=18179900 |url=http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297(07)00017-1 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.09.011}}</ref>
