The '''National Brain Tumor Society''' (NBTS) is a [[non-profit organization]] with offices in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. It was formed in 2008 by the merger of the [[National Brain Tumor Foundation]] and the [[Brain Tumor Society]]. Both organizations had been formed in the 1980s by parents and other individuals who wanted to increase both research funding and access to resources specific to brain tumors.

NBTS brings together [[research]] and patient services to be a resource for patients, families, caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals. In research, NBTS seeks new therapeutic targets, as well as to improve existing treatments, and encourages research that connects directly to patient care and enhances quality of life for all [[brain tumor]] patients. NBTS also provides education and information to help patients, families, and caregivers make informed decisions and develop strong support systems.

==Mission==
National Brain Tumor Society is a nonprofit organization inspiring hope and providing leadership within the [[brain tumor]] community. NBTS exists to find a cure and improve the quality of life for those affected by brain tumors. NBTS funds strategic research, delivers support services, and promotes collaboration.<ref name="National Brain Tumor Society" />
