{{For|the documentary film|Refrigerator Mothers}}
The term '''refrigerator mother''' was coined around 1950 as a label for mothers of children diagnosed with [[autism]] or [[schizophrenia]].  These mothers were often blamed for their children's atypical behavior, which included rigid [[ritual]]s, speech difficulty, and self-isolation.

The "refrigerator mother" label was based on the assumption that autistic behaviors stem from the emotional frigidity of the children's mothers.  As a result, mothers of some children on the [[autistic spectrum]] suffered from blame, guilt, and self-doubt from the 1950s throughout the 1970s and beyond,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} when the prevailing medical belief that autism resulted from inadequate parenting was widely assumed to be correct.  Some present-day proponents of the [[psychogenic]] theory of autism continue to maintain that the condition is a result of poor parenting.  However, others merely point out that some conditions are perhaps [[psychological]] in origin rather than [[physiological]], and that this is not necessarily a reflection on parenting skills.

==Origins of theory==
In his 1943 paper that first identified autism, [[Leo Kanner]] called attention to what appeared to him as a lack of warmth among the fathers and mothers of autistic children.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kanner L |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 |authorlink= Leo Kanner}} Reprinted in {{cite journal |year=1968 |journal= Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460 |quote= One other fact stands out prominently. In the whole group, there are very few really warmhearted fathers and mothers.... The children's aloneness from the beginning of life makes it difficult to attribute the whole picture exclusively to the type of the early parental relations with our patients. |last1=Kanner |first1=L |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact.}}</ref> In a 1949 paper, Kanner suggested autism may be related to a "genuine lack of maternal warmth", noted that fathers rarely stepped down to indulge in children's play, and observed that children were exposed from "the beginning to parental coldness, obsessiveness, and a mechanical type of attention to material needs only.... They were left neatly in refrigerators which did not defrost.  Their withdrawal seems to be an act of turning away from such a situation to seek comfort in solitude."<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x |journal= Am J Orthopsychiatry |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=416–26 |year=1949 |author= Kanner L |title= Problems of nosology and psychodynamics in early childhood autism |pmid=18146742}}</ref>  In a 1960 interview, Kanner bluntly described parents of autistic children as "just happening to defrost enough to produce a child."<ref>{{cite news |title= The child is father |work=TIME |date=1960-07-25 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826528,00.html |accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>

In the absence of any biomedical explanation for what causes autism after the telltale symptoms were first described by scientists, [[Bruno Bettelheim]], a [[University of Chicago]] professor and child development specialist, and other leading [[psychoanalyst]]s championed the notion that autism was the product of mothers who were cold, distant and rejecting, thus deprived of the chance to "bond properly".  The theory was embraced by the [[medical establishment]] and went largely unchallenged into the mid-1960s, but its effects have lingered into the 21st century.  Many articles and books published in that era blamed autism on a maternal lack of [[affection]], but by 1964, [[Bernard Rimland]], a [[psychologist]] who had a son with autism, published a book that signaled the emergence of a counter-explanation to the established misconceptions about the causes of autism.  His book, ''Infantile Autism:  The Syndrome and its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior'', attacked the refrigerator mother hypothesis directly.

Soon afterwards, Bettelheim wrote ''The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self'', in which he compared autism to being a prisoner in a [[concentration camp]]:

<blockquote>"The difference between the plight of prisoners in a concentration camp and the conditions which lead to autism and [[schizophrenia]] in children is, of course, that the child has never had a previous chance to develop much of a [[personality psychology|personality]]."</blockquote>

Some authority was granted to this as well, because Bettelheim had himself been interned at the [[Dachau concentration camp]] before World War II. The book was immensely popular and he became a leading public figure on autism until his death, but he became controversial after a biography, written 7 years after his death by a disgruntled cousin of a patient, claimed that he exaggerated his credentials and Dachau experiences.  Also, three ex-patients questioned his work, characterizing him as a cruel tyrant.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= First Things |issue=74 |pages=44–8 |author= Finn M |title= In the case of Bruno Bettelheim |year=1997 |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3709}}</ref>

Although Kanner was instrumental in framing the refrigerator mother theory, it was Bettelheim who facilitated its widespread acceptance by the public and the medical establishment [[cognoscenti]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1969, Kanner addressed the refrigerator mother issue at the first annual meeting of what is now the [[Autism Society of America]], stating:

<blockquote>From the very first publication until the last, I spoke of this condition in no uncertain terms as "[[innate]]."  But because I described some of the characteristics of the parents as persons, I was misquoted often as having said that "it is all the parents' fault."<ref>{{cite web|title='Refrigerator mother' tosh must go into cold storage|author=Feinstein A|publisher=autismconnect|url=http://autismconnect.org/news.asp?section=00010001&itemtype=adam&page=9&id=4540 |accessdate=2007-07-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927200621/http://autismconnect.org/news.asp?section=00010001&itemtype=adam&page=9&id=4540 |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref></blockquote>

==Other notable psychiatrists==
For [[Silvano Arieti]], who wrote his major works from the 1950s through the 70s, the terms ''autistic thought'' and what he called ''paleologic thought'' are apparently the same phenomenon.  Paleologic thought is a characteristic in both present-day schizophrenics and [[Human evolution|primitive men]], a type of thinking that has its foundations in non-[[Organon|Aristotelian logic]].  An autistic child speaks of himself as "you" and not infrequently of the mother as "I."  The "you" remains a "you" and is not transformed into "I".<ref>{{cite book

For [[Margaret Mahler]] and her colleagues, autism is a defense of children who cannot experience the mother as the living primary-object.  According to them, autism is an attempt at dedifferentiation and deanimation.<ref>{{cite book

  | year = 1959}}</ref> The symbiotic autistic syndrome used to be called the "Mahler syndrome" because Mahler first described it:  The child is unable to differentiate from the mother.

Arieti warned that an autistic tendency is a sign of a kind of disorder in the process of [[socialization]], and that when autistic expressions appear it should be assumed that there is a sort of difficulty between the child and his parents, especially [[Theodore_Lidz#.E2.80.9CSchizophrenogenic.E2.80.9D_parents|the schizogenic mother]].  Children who use autistic expressions, Arieti observes, are children who cannot bond socially.

In ''[[Interpretation of Schizophrenia]]'' Arieti maintained that for a normal process of socialization, it is necessary for the parent-child relations to be normal.  Loving or non-anxiety parental attitudes favor socialization.  Arieti not only maintained that the parent-child relations are the first social act and the major drive of socialization, but also a stimulus to either accept or reject society.  The child's [[self (psychology)|self]] in this view is a reflection of the sentiments, thoughts, and attitudes of the parents toward the child.  Autistic children show an extreme socializing disorder and do not want any sort of relationship with people.  They "eliminate" people from their consciousness.  For Arieti the fear of the parents is extended to other adults: a tendency to cut off communication with human beings.

==Persistence of the theory==
According to [[Peter Breggin]]’s ''Toxic Psychiatry'', the psychogenic theory of autism was abandoned for political pressure from parents' organizations, not for scientific reasons.  For example, some case reports have shown that profound institutional privation can result in quasi-autistic symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rutter M, Andersen-Wood L, Beckett C, et al. | title = Quasi-autistic patterns following severe early global privation. English and Romanian Adoptees (ERA) Study Team | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–49 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10357161 | doi = 10.1017/S0021963099003935}}</ref> Clinician Frances Tustin devoted her life to the theory. She wrote:

<blockquote>One must note that autism is one of a number of children's neurological disorders of psychogenic nature, i.e., caused by abusive and traumatic treatment of infants.… There is persistent denial by American society of the causes of damage to millions of children who are thus traumatized and brain damaged as a consequence of cruel treatment by parents who are otherwise too busy to love and care for their babies.<ref>{{vcite journal

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]], one of the best-known authors of the consequences of [[child abuse]], has maintained that autism is [[psychogenic]], and that fear of the truth about child abuse is the leitmotif of nearly all forms of autistic therapy known to her.  When Miller visited several [[autism therapy]] centers in the United States, it became apparent to her that the stories of children "inspired fear in both doctors and mothers alike":

<blockquote>I spent a day observing what happened to the group.  I also studied close-ups of children on video.  What became clearer and clearer as the day went on was that all these children had a serious history of suffering behind them.  This, however, was never referred to.…  In my conversations with the therapists and mothers, I inquired about the life stories of individual children.  The facts confirmed my hunch.  No one, however, was willing to take these facts seriously.<ref>{{cite book

  | publisher = Dutton
  | year = 1991
  | isbn = 0-525-93357-3
  | pages = 48–49}}</ref></blockquote>

Like Arieti and Tustin, Miller believes that only empathetic parental attitudes lead to the complete blossoming of the child’s personality.

The refrigerator mother theory, widely discarded in the United States, still has some support in France<ref>{{cite web|last=Heurtevent|first=David|title=Introduction to Autism in France: A Really Silly Psychiatric System !|url=http://www.supportthewall.org/2012/01/introduction-to-autism-in-france-a-really-silly-psychiatric-system/|work=Support The Wall - Autism|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=January 2, 2012}}</ref> and Europe and is largely believed in South Korea to be the cause of autism.<ref>{{cite news |work= The Guardian |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1996213,00.html |accessdate=2007-07-29 |date=2007-01-23 |title= Breaking down barriers |author= Cohen D}}</ref> The academic psychologist [[Tony Humphreys]] of [[University College Cork]] is a leading Irish proponent of the theory of frigid parenting, despite censure by the [[Psychological Society of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news |work= The Journal.ie |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/controversial-autism-article-should-be-retracted-psychological-society-of-ireland-350914-Feb2012/ |date=2012-02-09 |title= Controversial autism article should be retracted - Psychological Society of Ireland}}</ref>

== Modern alternatives ==

The modern consensus is that autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and are not well understood.<ref name=Abrahams>{{cite journal |journal= Nat Rev Genet |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=341–55 |title= Advances in autism genetics: on the threshold of a new neurobiology |author= Abrahams BS, Geschwind DH |doi=10.1038/nrg2346 |pmid=18414403 |pmc= 2756414}}</ref>  Although recent studies have indicated that maternal warmth, praise, and quality of relationship are associated with reductions of behavior problems in adolescents and adults with autism, and that maternal criticisms are associated with maladaptive behaviors and symptoms, these ideas are distinct from the refrigerator mother hypothesis.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Am J Ment Retard |year=2008 |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=387–402 |title= Symptoms and behavior problems of adolescents and adults with autism: effects of mother-child relationship quality, warmth, and praise |author= Smith LE, Greenberg JS, Seltzer MM, Hong J |doi=10.1352/2008.113:387-402 |pmid=18702558 |pmc= 2826841}}</ref>

==Documentaries==
In 2003, [[Kartemquin Films]] released ''[[Refrigerator Mothers]]'', a documentary that takes a look at American mothers of the 1950s and 1960s and the blame leveled by the medical establishment for the mothers causing their children's autism.  The documentary gives voice to women who no longer accept the blame that was once common for mothers of autistic children.<ref>[http://www.kartemquin.com/films/refrigerator-mothers Refrigerator Mothers :: Kartemquin Films]</ref>  Making its television premiere on [[PBS|PBS's]] ''[[P.O.V.]]'' series, ''Refrigerator Mothers'' was featured in a January 2010 issue of ''[[Psychology Today]]'' that focused on the racial and class stereotyping of autism.<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/aspergers-diary/201001/bias-bettelheim-and-autism-is-history-repeating-itself-0/ "Bias, Bettelheim and Autism: Is History Repeating Itself?".]  Soraya, Lynne.
