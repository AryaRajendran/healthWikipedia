The '''contraceptive sponge''' combines [[barrier contraception|barrier]] and [[Spermicide|spermicidal]] methods to prevent [[fertilisation|conception]].  Three brands are marketed: Pharmatex, Protectaid and Today. Pharmatex is marketed in [[France]] and the province of [[Quebec]]; Protectaid in the rest of [[Canada]] and [[Europe]]; and Today in the [[United States]].<ref name="CBAS">{{cite web |title=Sponges |work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |year=2004 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/sponges.cfm |accessdate=2006-09-17 }}</ref>

Sponges work in two ways.  First, the sponge is inserted into the vagina, so it can cover the cervix and prevent any sperm from entering the uterus. Secondly, the sponge is produced with spermicide already inside of it, which is used to prevent the sperm from moving.<ref>[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-sponge-today-sponge-4224.htm Planned Parenthood.] (2011).  Retrieved February 3, 2010.</ref>

The sponges are inserted [[vagina]]lly prior to intercourse and must be placed over the [[cervix]] to be effective.
Sponges provide no protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

==Effectiveness==
The manufacturer of the Today sponge reports effectiveness for prevention of pregnancy of 89% to 91% when used correctly and consistently. When packaging directions are not followed for every act of intercourse, effectiveness rates of 84% to 89% are reported.<!--

==Use==
To use the Today sponge, it must be run under water until thoroughly wet, about 2 tablespoons.<ref name="mfg" /> The water is used as a mechanism to activate the spermicide inside the sponge.<ref name="Mayo Clinic">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/contraceptive-sponge/MY00989/DSECTION=what-you-can-expect Mayo Clinic.] (2010). Retrieved February 3, 2011</ref>  No extra spermicide is needed.<ref name="Mayo Clinic"/>  The Protectaid<ref name=CBAS />
and Pharmatex<ref name="GHO" /> sponges come ready to use.

The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse. It must be left in place for at least six hours after intercourse. It should not be worn for more than 30 hours in a row.<ref>[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-sponge-today-sponge-4224.htm]</ref>

The sponge should never be reused once it has been removed after having sexual intercourse.<ref name="Mayo Clinic"/>

==History==
The devices have had periods of unavailability in some markets since being introduced. All three brands are currently available outside their normal marketing areas through internet retailers.

===Today sponge===
{{main|Today sponge}}
The Today Sponge was developed beginning in 1976 and introduced in the United States in 1983. Today was removed from the market in 1994. Following several delays, the Today brand became available again in Canada in March 2003, and in the U.S. in September 2005. After the manufacturer's parent company declared bankruptcy in 2007, the brand was off the market until relaunched in 2009.

===Pharmatex sponge===
The Pharmatex sponge was introduced in France and the Quebec province in Canada in 1984.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |author=Menard F |title=The health of women and contraception in Quebec | journal = IPPF Eur Reg Inf | volume = 13 | issue = 1 |pages=18–20 |year=1984 | pmid = 12178356}}</ref>

===Protectaid sponge===
The Protectaid sponge was introduced in Canada in 1996, and in Europe in 2000.<ref name=CBAS />

==Spermicide==
Sponges are a physical barrier, trapping sperm and preventing their passage through the cervix into the female reproductive system.  The [[spermicide]] is an important component of pregnancy prevention; each brand offers a different formula.

The Today sponge contains 1,000&nbsp;[[milligram]]s (mg) of [[nonoxynol-9]].<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |last=Best |first=Kim |title=New Devices May Be Easier to Use | journal = Network | volume = 20 | issue = 2|publisher=Family Health International |year=2000 |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/6read/6issues/6network/v20-2/nt2023.html |accessdate=2006-10-01 }}</ref>  Protectaid contains 5,000&nbsp;mg of the F-5 gel, with three active ingredients (6.25&nbsp;mg of nonoxynol-9, 6.25&nbsp;mg of [[benzalkonium chloride]], and 25&nbsp;mg of sodium cholate).<ref name="GHO" />  Pharmatex contains 60&nbsp;mg of benzalkonium chloride.<ref name=CBAS />

==Side effects==
Some people are allergic to the spermicide used in the sponge.  Women who use contraceptive sponges have an increased risk of [[yeast infection]] and [[urinary tract infection]].  Improper use, such as leaving the sponge in too long, can result in [[toxic shock syndrome]].

The Today sponge contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9, which may contain certain risks for those using the sponge multiple times a day, or for those at risk for HIV. In these cases, nonoxynol-9 can irritate the tissue, which leads to an increased risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.<ref>[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-sponge-today-sponge-4224.htm Planned Parenthood] (2011).

==In U.S.A popular culture==
*Shortly after they were taken off the U.S. market, the sponge was featured in an episode of the [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' titled "[[The Sponge (Seinfeld episode)|The Sponge]]". In the episode, the character [[Elaine Benes]] conserves her remaining [[Today sponge]]s by refusing [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] unless she is certain her partner is "sponge-worthy".<ref name="lavery2006">Lavery, David and Sara Lewis Dunne (2006). ''Seinfeld, master of its domain: revisiting television's greatest sitcom'', p. 247. Continuum International Publishing Group, ISBN 978-0-8264-1803-6</ref>
*The film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' features a scene where the characters [[List of Clueless characters#Dionne Davenport|Dionne]] and [[List of Clueless characters#Tai Frasier|Tai]] are discussing sex and Dionne is heard to ask Tai if the sponge would still work if the user has sex in water.
*On the TV series "[[My So-Called Life]]," the doctor tells Angela to use a sponge if she's thinking of having sex.
