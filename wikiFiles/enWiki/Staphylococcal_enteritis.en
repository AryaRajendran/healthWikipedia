'''Staphylococcal enteritis''' is an inflammation that is usually caused by eating or drinking substances contaminated with staph enterotoxin. The toxin, not the bacterium, settles in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling.  This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, dehydration, diarrhea and fever.<ref name=vorvick>{{cite web|last=Vorvick|first=L.|title=Enteritis|url=http://averaorg.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&pid=1&gid=001149|publisher=Avera Health|accessdate=15 May 2012|coauthors=Longstreth, G., & Zieve, D|date=12 April 2010}}</ref>  

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is a gram-positive, [[facultative]] anaerobe, [[coccal]] (round shaped) bacteria that appears in grape-like clusters that can thrive in high salt and low water activity habitats. ''S. aureus'' bacteria can live on the skin which is one of the primary modes of transmission. ''S. aureus'' can cause a range of illnesses from minor skin infections to Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning enteritis. Since humans are the primary source, cross-contamination this is the most common way the [[microorganism]] is introduced into foods. Foods at high risks are those prepared in large quantities. 
Staphylococcus aureus is a true food poisoning organism. It produces a heat stable toxin [[enterotoxin]] when allowed to grow for several hours in foods such as cream-filled baked goods, poultry meat, gravies, eggs, meat salads, puddings and vegetables. It is important to note that the toxins may be present in dangerous amounts in foods that have no signs of spoilage, such as a bad smell, any off color, odor, or textural or flavor change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Disease Listing, Staphylococcal Food Poisoning, General Info CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases.|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/staphylococcus_food_g.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=29 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BBB - Staphylococcus aureus|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070015.htm.|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=4 May 2009}}</ref>

[[Enteritis]] is the inflammation of the small intestine. It is generally caused by eating or drinking substances that are contaminated with bacteria or viruses. The bacterium and/or toxin settles in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling.  This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, fever, and dehydration.<ref name=vorvick/> There are other types of enteritis, the types include: bacterial gastroenteritis, [[Campylobacter]] enteritis, ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' enteritis, radiation enteritis, [[Salmonella]] enteritis and [[Shigella]] enteritis.

== Pathogensis==
''S. aureus'' is an enterotoxin producer. Enterotoxins are chromosomally encoded exotoxins that are produced and secreted from several bacterial organisms. It is a heat stable toxin and is resistant to digestive [[protease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vesterlund|first=S.|title=Staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria|journal=Microbiology|date=1 June 2006|volume=152|issue=6|pages=1819–1826|doi=10.1099/mic.0.28522-0}}</ref><ref name=NCZVED>{{cite web|title=CDC - Staphylococcal Food Poisoning - NCZVED|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/staphylococcal/#what|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=7 June 2010}}</ref>  It is the ingestion of the toxin that causes the inflammation and swelling of the intestine.

== Symptoms==

Common symptoms of Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning include: a rapid onset which is usually 1–8 hours, nausea, explosive vomiting for up to 24 hours, abdominal cramps/pain, headache, weakness, diarrhea and usually a subnormal body temperature. Symptoms usually start one to six hours after eating and last less than 12 hours. The duration of some cases may take two or more days to fully resolve.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enteritis - PubMed Health|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002134/|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=12 April 2010}}</ref>

== Tests and Exams==

For the detection of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' food poisoning which can lead to Staphylococcal enteritis a stool culture may be required. A stool culture is used to detect the presence of disease-causing bacteria (pathogenic) and help diagnose an infection of the digestive tract. In the case of Staphylococcal enteritis it is conducted to see if the stool is positive for a [[pathogenic]] bacterium.<ref name=vorvick/>

== Treatment and Diet==
Treatment is supportive and based upon symptoms, with fluid and electrolyte replacement as the primary goal. Dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting is the most common complication. To prevent dehydration, it is important to take frequent sips of a rehydration drink (like Gatorade) or try to drink a cup of water or rehydration drink for each large, loose stool. 

Dietary management of enteritis consists of starting with a clear liquid diet until vomiting and diarrhea end and then slowly introduce the [[BRATT diet]]. The BRATT diet consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, tea, and toast. It is also important to avoid foods that are high in fiber or are possibly difficult to digest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enteritis Diet|accessdate=9 April 2012|url=http://www.rd411.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227:enteritis-diet&catid=91:diseases-and-medical-conditions&Itemid=385|date=1 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>

== Prevention ==

Staphylococcal enteritis may be avoided by using proper hygiene and sanitation with food preparation. This includes thoroughly cooking all meats. If food is to be stored longer than two hours, keep hot foods hot (over 140°F) and cold foods cold (40°F or under).<ref name="NCZVED"/> Ensure to refrigerate leftovers promptly and store cooked food in a wide, shallow container and refrigerate as soon as possible.  [[Sanitation]] is very important.  Keep kitchens and food-serving areas clean and sanitized. Finally, as most Staphylococcal food poisoning are the result of food handling, hand washing is critical.  Food handlers should use hand sanitizers with alcohol or through hand washing with soap and water.<ref>Lalla, F., & Dingle, P. (2004). The efficacy cleaning products on food industry surfaces.

Tips for Hand Washing

1. Wash hands with warm, soapy water before and after handling raw foods

:a. First, wet your hands
:
:b. Add soap to your hands
:
:c. Rub both sides for at least 20 seconds
:
:d. Rinse thoroughly

:e. Air dry, or dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel

2. Always wash your hands after using the toilet, after changing a baby’s diaper, after touching pets or other animals, and after sneezing or coughing

3. Properly dress or glove
