A '''barbiturate overdose''' results when a person takes a larger-than-prescribed dose of [[barbiturate]]s. Symptoms of an overdose typically include sluggishness, incoordination, difficulty in thinking, slowness of speech, faulty judgment, drowsiness, shallow breathing, and staggering. In severe cases, coma and death can result.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000951.htm |title= Barbiturate intoxication and overdose |accessdate= 15 July 2008 | publisher = MedLine Plus }}</ref> The lethal dosage of barbiturates varies greatly with [[Drug_tolerance|tolerance]] and from one individual to another.<ref>Keltner, Norman."Psychiatric Nursing 4th Edition" Evolve Press,2003.</ref>

Barbiturate overdose with other CNS (central nervous system) depressants, such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[opiates]] or [[benzodiazepines]], is even more dangerous due to additive CNS and respiratory depressant effects. In the case of benzodiazepines, barbiturates also increase the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine [[Binding_site|binding sites]] thus leading to an exaggerated effect of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller LG, Deutsch SI, Greenblatt DJ, Paul SM, Shader RI |title=Acute barbiturate administration increases benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=385â€“90 |year=1988 |pmid=2906155 |doi= 10.1007/BF00216067|url=}}</ref>

The treatment of barbiturate abuse or overdose is generally supportive. The amount of support required depends on the person's symptoms. 
If the patient is drowsy but awake and can swallow and breathe without difficulty, the treatment can be as simple as monitoring the patient closely.
If the patient is not breathing, it may involve mechanical ventilation until the drug has worn off.

Supportive treatment often includes the following:
* Activated charcoal may be given via nasogastric tube. 

* Intravenous administration of saline, [[naloxone]], [[thiamine]], and/or [[glucose]].

* [[Sodium bicarbonate|NaHCO<sub>3</sub>]] to alkalize the urine to increase rate of excretion

* Observation in the Emergency Department for a number of hours or admission to the hospital for several days of observation if symptoms are severe.

* Advise the patient about drug misuse or refer for psychiatric consult.
