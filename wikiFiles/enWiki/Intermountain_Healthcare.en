'''Intermountain Health Care, Inc.''', officially [[doing business as]]  '''Intermountain Healthcare''', is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Health care|healthcare]] system and is the largest healthcare provider in the [[Intermountain West]]. Until 2005 it was known as '''Intermountain Health Care''' or more commonly '''IHC'''; it is now often referred to as simply '''Intermountain''' for short.  Intermountain Healthcare provides hospital and other medical services in [[Utah]] and [[Idaho]] and also offers [[integrated managed care]] under the insurance brand '''SelectHealth'''. Intermountain Healthcare is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and currently employs over 32,000 people.

==History==
[[File:Intermountain Health Care 1975 logo.svg|thumb|'''Intermountain Health Care, Inc. (IHC)''' logo 1975-2005|left]]
Intermountain Healthcare was founded on 1 April 1975. Prior to Intermountain, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] operated many of the hospitals in the region. The church decided in 1974 it would no longer operate the hospitals and decided it would donate its fifteen hospitals as a system to the intermountain community. The church did this on the condition that a not-for-profit organization would be formed to operate the hospitals on behalf of the communities they served.

Since its inception, board members of Intermountain Healthcare have been unpaid volunteers. Raising funds was done through the bond market and within just a few years, several additional hospitals asked to join the Intermountain organization. Intermountain's hospital market share (about 45 percent of Utah's hospital beds) has remained consistent since the organization was formed.

In 1982, Intermountain Healthcare began providing non-hospital services such as clinics and home healthcare. Four additional hospitals were added from 1982 to 1990. In 1991, Intermountain was recipient of [[The Healthcare Forum/Witt]] award.

In the mid-1990s, Intermountain Healthcare restructured into three major groups: hospitals, physicians, and health plans.

In 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, Intermountain Healthcare was ranked No. 1 (among nearly 600 evaluated) integrated healthcare systems in the U.S. by [[Modern Healthcare]] magazine and the Verispan research firm.  The rankings measured efficiency, communication cost and quality of care. Intermountain is the only organization to have been ranked No. 1 five times. Intermountain has been named the No. 2 integrated health system in the country in 2001, 2006 and 2007. Intermountain has also received several other awards for the organization's pioneering use of electronic medical records and evidence-based medical care guidelines.

In 2002, Intermountain served as the Medical Services Provider for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City.

In November 2005, Intermountain implemented a new logo and slightly changed the spelling of its name from Intermountain Health Care to Intermountain Healthcare. The purpose was to reflect today's more common spelling of "healthcare." Up until this time, Intermountain was well known as "IHC." In April 2006, Intermountain renamed its health insurance plan "SelectHealth" and formalized the separate management of the insurance side of the organization.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3669782&itype=NGPSID|title=IHC Health Plans changing name|last=Fantin|first=Linda|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=4 Apr 2006|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref> The move helped to appease some critics who complained about the difficulty of competing against an organization that offered insurance, hospitals, and clinics through one system.

Intermountain has sometimes been subject to review by the [[Utah State Legislature]] because of the hospital organization's nonprofit mission and because they own 20 of Utah's 60 hospitals. However, proposals by competitors to force Intermountain to sell off either the insurance or hospital components of the organization have been fruitless.

In 2005 the Utah State Legislature hired an outside research company to review Utah's healthcare marketplace.  While the independent experts did not address all of the challenges facing Utah's healthcare industry, the researchers did conclude that "considerable evidence exists to support the conclusion that Utah's health-care markets are performing competitively. . . Intervention by the Utah Legislature to promote competition in these markets is not necessary."  The six-month study recommended that the Utah legislature refrain from creating more regulations for Utah's healthcare marketplace stating, "Competitive markets are more likely to be harmed than helped by regulatory directives."

In 2009, Intermountain Healthcare was identified as a healthcare model by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], ""We have long known that some places, like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah. . ., offer high-quality care at cost below average."<ref name="Obama">{{cite news|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=7873613|title=Obama singles out Intermountain Healthcare as model system|last=Daley|first=John|work=[[KSL-TV|ksl.com]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=10 Sep 2009|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref> According to the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], Utah's per capita spending on healthcare is 44 percent below the national average.<ref name="Obama"/>

Intermountain Healthcare announced that beginning in 2011 it would offer health insurance benefits for its employees' domestic partners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=12916550&pid=1|title=Intermountain Healthcare offers benefits to domestic partners|last=Giauque|first=Marc|work=[[KSL-TV|ksl.com]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=21 Oct 2010|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref>

As of 2013, Intermountain Healthcare operates 22 hospitals in Utah and 1 hospital in Idaho. Intermountain also operates clinics, and urgent care facilities that are run by physicians as part of the Intermountain Medical Group. In total, Intermountain Healthcare operates over 160 healthcare facilities, employs about 700 of Utah's 4,600 physicians and provides insurance to about 19 percent of Utah.

==Life Flight==
[[File:Intermountain Healthcare Life Flight logo.svg|thumb|'''Intermountain Healthcare Life Flight''' logo (since 2005)|left]]
Intermountain Life Flight, Intermountain Healthcare's [[air ambulance]] unit, provides emergency air transportation as well as non-emergency transport for victims particularly in remote areas, as well as emergency scenes where time is critical. In addition to transport, Life Flight also provides [[search-and-rescue]] services to the region. It currently consists of five [[helicopters]] and three [[fixed-wing aircraft]].

Life Flight originally began service in 1972 with just fixed-winged aircraft, but on 6 July 1978 it performed its first patient transport by helicopter, becoming the seventh helicopter (rotor wing) [[Air medical services|air medical service]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.helimx.com/article/intermountain-life-flight-adult-and-children%E2%80%99s-critical-care-specialists|title=Intermountain Life Flight - Adult and Children’s Critical Care Specialists|work=HeliMx|date=1 Oct 2012|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref>

Intermountain currently operates two [[Agusta]] [[AgustaWestland AW109#Variants|A109K2]] helicopters, one Agusta [[AgustaWestland AW109#Variants|AW109 SP Grand]], and two [[Bell 407]] helicopters. The helicopters are based at [[McKay-Dee Hospital Center]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Odgen]], [[Utah Valley Regional Medical Center]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Intermountain Medical Center]] in [[Murray, Utah|Murray]], [[Primary Children's Medical Center]] in [[Salt Lake City]], and [[Dixie Regional Medical Center]] in [[St. George, Utah|St. George]]. Life Flight also operates three [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft B200 King Air]] twin-turboprop aircraft. Two are based at Life Flight's operations center at the [[Salt Lake City International Airport]], and the third is based at [[St. George Municipal Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/lifeflight/about/aircraft/|title=Life Flight > About Life Flight > Aircraft|publisher=Intermountaion Healthcare|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref>  The helicopters generally service an area 150 mile around their base, but can travel 1,000 miles without refueling.  In addition to servicing Utah, Life Flight transports patients from [[Arizona]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[Wyoming]], and other locations in the [[Western United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/lifeflight/about/bases/|title=Life Flight > About Life Flight > Bases|publisher=Intermountaion Healthcare|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref>

Life Flight and its staff are [[Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems]] (CAMTS) certified.  All of Life Flight's helicopters routinely use [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]] (NVG) and its Agusta Grands can operate in high-altitude situations. Life Flight can can provide a [[Emergency medical services in the United States#Medical control|medical control physician]] [[24/7]] so it staff does not have to rely solely on standing orders or [[Medical protocol|protocol]]s, as do many other similar air medical services.  Life Flight has six teams:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/lifeflight/about/teams/|title=Life Flight > About Life Flight > Teams|publisher=Intermountaion Healthcare|accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}</ref>

*Neonatal Team - Life Flight performs about 1,200 neonatal transports each year
*Respiratory Team
*LVAD Team - Assisting those patients in need of a [[ventricular assist device]]
*Hoist / Search & Rescue Team - Life Flight has performed hoist rescues since 2001; in fact, it is the first and only ''civilian'' air ambulance service in the United States that conducts hoist rescues<ref name="Helihub"/> and the only such service in the intermountian region.
