'''Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia''' ('''HIT''') is the development of [[thrombocytopenia]] (a low [[platelet]] count), due to the administration of various forms of [[heparin]], an [[anticoagulant]]. HIT predisposes to [[thrombosis]], the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a [[blood vessel]], and when thrombosis is identified the condition is called '''heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis''' ('''HITT'''). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal [[antibody|antibodies]] that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific [[blood test]]s.<ref name=Ahmed>{{cite journal |author=Ahmed I, Majeed A, Powell R |title=Heparin induced thrombocytopenia: diagnosis and management update |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=83 |issue=983 |pages=575–82 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17823223 |pmc=2600013 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2007.059188 |url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/83/983/575}}</ref>

The treatment of HIT requires both protection from thrombosis and choice of an agent that will not reduce the platelet count further. Several agents exist for this purpose, mainly [[lepirudin]] and [[argatroban]].<ref name=Ahmed/> While heparin was discovered in the 1930s, HIT was not reported until the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin>{{cite journal |author=Kelton JG, Warkentin TE |title=Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a historical perspective |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=7 |pages=2607–16 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18809774 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-02-078014 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/112/7/2607}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

Heparin may be used for both prevention and the treatment of thrombosis. It exists in two main forms: an "unfractionated" form that can be [[subcutaneous injection|injected under the skin]] or through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous infusion]], and a "low molecular weight" form that is generally given [[subcutaneous|subcutaneously]] (administered under the skin). Commonly used low molecular weight heparins are [[enoxaparin]], [[dalteparin]], and [[tinzaparin]].<ref name=Hirsh>{{cite journal |author=Hirsh J, Bauer KA, Donati MB, Gould M, Samama MM, Weitz JI |title=Parenteral anticoagulants: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition) |journal=Chest |volume=133 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=141S–159S |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18574264 |doi=10.1378/chest.08-0689}}</ref>

In HIT, the platelet count in the blood falls below the normal range, a condition called [[thrombocytopenia]]. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the platelet count will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.<ref name=Ahmed/> 

The most common symptom of HIT is enlargement or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or the development of a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in [[artery|arteries]] or [[vein]]s, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]] ("heart attack"), and [[peripheral vascular disease|acute leg ischemia]]. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and in the [[lung]] in the form of a [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Warkentin2006>{{cite journal | author=Warkentin TE | title=Think of HIT | journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program | year=2006 | pages=408–14 | pmid=17124091 | doi=10.1182/asheducation-2006.1.408 | volume=2006}}</ref>

In those receiving heparin through an intravenous infusion, a complex of symptoms ("systemic reaction") may occur when the infusion is started. These include [[fever]], [[Rigor (medicine)|chills]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|a fast heart rate]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], and [[chest pain]]. This happens in about a quarter of people with HIT. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of [[erythema|red spots]].<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Warkentin2006/>

==Mechanism==
Heparin occurs naturally in the human body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin sulfate may act as a [[hapten]], and thus be targeted by the [[immune system]]. In HIT, the immune system forms [[antibody|antibodies]] against heparin when it is bound to a protein called [[platelet factor 4]] (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the [[immunoglobulin G|IgG]] class and their development usually takes about five days. However, those who have been exposed to heparin in the last few months may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months.<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Warkentin2006/> HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin sulfate, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.<ref name=WarkentinMakris>{{cite journal | author=Warkentin TE, Makris M, Jay RM, Kelton JG | year=2008 | title=A spontaneous prothrombotic disorder resembling heparin-induced thrombocytopenia | journal=Am J Med | volume = 121 | pages=632–6 | doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.03.012 | pmid=18589060 | issue=7}}</ref>

The IgG antibodies form a complex with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The tail of the antibody then binds to the [[FCGR2A|FcγIIa receptor]], a protein on the surface of the platelet. This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Warkentin2006/>

Formation of PF4-heparin antibodies is common in people receiving heparin, but only a proportion of these develop thrombocytopenia or thrombosis.<ref name=Ahmed/> This has been referred to as an "iceberg phenomenon".<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/>

==Diagnosis==
HIT may be suspected if blood tests show a falling platelet count in someone receiving heparin, even if the heparin has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving heparin have a [[complete blood count]] (which includes a platelet count) on a regular basis while receiving heparin.<ref name=Hirsh/><ref name=Keeling>{{cite journal |author=Keeling D, Davidson S, Watson H |title=The management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=133 |issue=3 |pages=259–69 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16643427 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06018.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118607806/HTMLSTART}}</ref>

However, not all people with a falling platelet count while receiving heparin turn out to have HIT. The timing, severity of the thrombocytopenia, the occurrence of new thrombosis, and the presence of alternative explanations, all determine the likelihood that HIT is present. A commonly used score to predict the likelihood of HIT is the "4 Ts" score introduced in 2003.<ref name=4Toriginal/> A score of 0–8 points is generated; if the score is 0-3, HIT is unlikely. A score of 4–5 indicates intermediate probability, while a score of 6–8 makes it highly likely. Those with a high score may need to be treated with an alternative drug while more sensitive and specific tests for HIT are performed, while those with a low score can safely continue receiving heparin as the likelihood that they have HIT is extremely low.<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Warkentin2006/><ref name=Warkentin2003>{{cite journal |author=Warkentin TE, Aird WC, Rand JH |title=Platelet-endothelial interactions: sepsis, HIT, and antiphospholipid syndrome |journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program |pages=497–519 |year=2003 |pmid=14633796 |doi=10.1182/asheducation-2003.1.497 |url=http://asheducationbook.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/2003/1/497}}</ref> In an analysis of the reliability of the 4T score, a low score had a [[negative predictive value]] of 0.998, while an intermediate score had a [[positive predictive value]] of 0.14 and a high score a positive predictive value of 0.64; intermediate and high scores therefore warrant further investigation.<ref name=Cuker2012>{{cite journal |author=Cuker A, Gimotty PA, Crowther MA, Warkentin TE |title=Predictive value of the 4Ts scoring system for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Blood |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=4160–4167 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22990018 |doi=10.1182/blood-2012-07-443051 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/120/20/4160.full}}</ref>

The first screening test in someone suspected of having HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the [[ELISA]] (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also [[Type I and type II errors|falsely identify]] antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested for the release of [[serotonin]], a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Warkentin2006/>

If someone has been diagnosed with HIT, some recommend routine [[Medical ultrasonography#Doppler sonography|Doppler sonography]] of the leg veins to identify deep vein thromboses, as this is very common in HIT.<ref name=Warkentin2006/><ref name=Warkentin2003/>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Argatroban.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of argatroban, a [[direct thrombin inhibitor]] used as an alternative to heparin in HIT.]]

Given the fact that HIT predisposes strongly to new episodes of thrombosis, it is not sufficient to simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, [[warfarin]], should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of [[warfarin necrosis]] in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar [[Vitamin K antagonist|vitamin K inhibitor]]. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with [[vitamin K]].<ref name=Ahmed/><ref name=Keeling/> Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.<ref name=Keeling/>

Three agents are used to provide anticoagulation in patients with strongly suspected or proven HIT: [[danaparoid]], [[lepirudin]], and [[argatroban]]. These are alternatives to heparin therapy. Not all agents are registered in all countries. For instance, argatroban is not used in the United Kingdom<ref name=Keeling/> and danaparoid is not available in the United States.<ref name=WarkentinMakris/> Lepirudin production stopped on May 31, 2012.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} A fourth agent acting as a Factor Xa inhibitor also has an off label use for HIT treatment known as fondaparinux and is available and commonly used in the United States.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[systematic review]], patients treated with [[lepirudin]] for HIT showed a [[relative risk reduction]] of clinical outcome (death, amputation, etc.) to be 0.52 and 0.42 when compared to patient controls. In addition, patients treated with [[argatroban]] for HIT showed a [[relative risk reduction]] of the above clinical outcomes to be 0.20 and 0.18.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirsh J, Heddle N, Kelton J |title=Treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a critical review |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=164 |issue=4 |pages=361–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14980986 |doi=10.1001/archinte.164.4.361 | url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/164/4/361}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The exact number of cases of HIT in the general population is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly [[cardiothoracic surgery]], have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.<ref name=Warkentin2006/>

==History==
While heparin was introduced for clinical use in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Weismann RE, Tobin RW |title=Arterial embolism occurring during systemic heparin therapy |journal=AMA Arch Surg |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=219–25; discussion 225–7 |year=1958 |month=February |pmid=13497418}}</ref> The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Natelson EA, Lynch EC, Alfrey CP, Gross JB |title=Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. An unexpected response to treatment of consumption coagulopathy |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1121–5 |year=1969 |month=December |pmid=5391254}}</ref> prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/> A 1973 report established HIT as a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features were the result of an immune process.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rhodes GR, Dixon RH, Silver D |title=Heparin induced thrombocytopenia with thrombotic and hemorrhagic manifestations |journal=Surg Gynecol Obstet |volume=136 |issue=3 |pages=409–16 |year=1973 |month=March |pmid=4688805}}</ref>

Initially, various theories existed about the exact cause of the low platelets in HIT. Gradually, evidence accumulated on the exact underlying mechanism, and diagnostic tests for the condition emerged in the 1980s.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/> Treatment was initially limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw the introduction of a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/> Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and self-limiting fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a modifier to describe the immune-mediated severe form.<ref name=KeltonWarkentin/>
