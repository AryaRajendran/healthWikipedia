==Signs and symptoms==
Individuals with PBC may present with the following:
*[[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
*[[Pruritus]] (itchy skin)
*[[Jaundice]] (yellowing of the eyes and skin), due to increased [[bilirubin]] in the blood.
*[[Xanthoma]] (local collections of [[cholesterol]] in the skin, especially around the eyes ([[xanthelasma]]))
* Complications of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]]:
** Fluid retention in the abdomen ([[ascites]])
** [[Hypersplenism]]
** [[Esophageal varices]]
** [[Hepatic encephalopathy]], including coma in extreme cases.
* Association with an extrahepatic autoimmune disorder such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] or [[Sjögren's syndrome]] (in up to 80% of cases).

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Primary biliary cirrhosis intermed mag.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Intermediate magnification [[micrograph]] of '''PBC''' showing bile duct inflammation and periductal [[granuloma]]s. [[Liver]] [[biopsy]]. [[H&E stain]].]] [[File:ANA NUCLEAR DOT AND AMA.jpg|thumb|[[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of [[sp100 nuclear antigen|sp100]] antibodies (nuclear dots) and [[anti-mitochondrial antibody|AMA]].]]
To diagnose PBC, distinctions should be established from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as [[autoimmune hepatitis]] or [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] (PSC).

Diagnostic [[blood test]]s include:
* Deranged [[liver function test]]s (elevated [[gamma-glutamyl transferase]] and [[alkaline phosphatase]])
* Presence of certain [[antibodies]]: [[antimitochondrial antibody]] (AMA), [[antinuclear antibody]] (ANA)

Abdominal [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or a [[CT scan]] is usually performed to rule out blockage to the bile ducts. Previously most suspected sufferers underwent a [[liver biopsy]], and — if uncertainty remained  — [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP, an [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] investigation of the [[bile duct]]). Now most patients are diagnosed without invasive investigation since the combination of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (see below) and typical (cholestatic) liver function tests are considered diagnostic.  However, a liver [[biopsy]] is necessary to determine the stage of disease.

'''Anti-nuclear antibodies''' appear to be prognostic agents in PBC. [[Anti-glycoprotein-210 antibodies]], and to a lesser degree [[anti-p62 antibodies]] correlate with progression toward end stage liver failure. [[Anti-centromere antibodies]] correlate with developing portal hypertension.<ref name="pmid17187436">{{cite journal | author=Nakamura M, Kondo H, Mori T, ''et al.'' | title=Anti-gp210 and anti-centromere antibodies are different risk factors for the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis | journal=Hepatology | volume=45 | issue=1 | pages=118–127 | year=2007 | pmid=17187436 | doi=10.1002/hep.21472}}</ref> Anti-np62<ref name="pmid11303304">{{cite journal | author=Nesher G, Margalit R, Ashkenazi YJ | title=Anti-nuclear envelope antibodies: Clinical associations | journal=Semin.

===Biopsy===
Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by interlobular bile duct destruction.  [[Histopathologic]] findings of primary biliary cirrhosis include:<ref name=pmid10976014>{{cite journal | pmid = 10976014 | doi=10.1053/bega.2000.0103 | volume=14 | issue=4 | title=Destruction of bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis | year=2000 | month=August | author=Nakanuma Y, Tsuneyama K, Sasaki M, Harada K | journal=Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | pages=549–70}}</ref>
*Inflammation of the bile ducts, characterized by intraepithelial [[lymphocyte]]s, and
*Periductal [[epithelioid]] [[granulomata]].

===Summary of stages===
*''Stage 1 — Portal Stage'': Normal sized triads; portal inflammation, subtle [[bile duct]] damage.  [[Granulomas]] are often detected in this stage.

*''Stage 2 — Periportal Stage'': Enlarged triads; periportal [[fibrosis]] and/or [[inflammation]]. Typically characterized by the finding of a proliferation of small bile ducts.

*''Stage 3 — Septal Stage'': Active and/or passive fibrous septa.

*''Stage 4 — Biliary Cirrhosis'': Nodules present; garland

==Etiology==
The cause of the disease is unknown at this time, but research indicates that there is an [[immunological]] basis for the [[disease]], making it an [[autoimmune disorder]].  Most of the patients (>90%) seem to have anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) against [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]]  (PDC-E2), an enzyme complex that is found in the [[mitochondria]].

Primary biliary cirrhosis is considerably more common in those with [[Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions#Diseases of the pancreas.2C gall bladder.2C bile duct|gluten sensitive enteropathy]] than the normal population.<ref name="pmid74661">{{cite journal | author = Logan RF, Ferguson A, Finlayson ND, Weir DG | title = Primary biliary cirrhosis and coeliac disease: an association? | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8058 | pages = 230–3 | year = 1978 | pmid = 74661 | doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(78)90480-4 }}</ref><ref name="pmid12385447">{{cite journal | author = Volta U, Rodrigo L, Granito A, ''et al.'' | title = Celiac disease in autoimmune cholestatic liver disorders | journal = Am.

A genetic predisposition to disease has been thought important for some time, as evident by cases of PBC in family members, concordance in identical twins, and clustering of autoimmune diseases.  In 2009 a Canadian led group of investigators reported in the New England Journal of Medicine results from the first PBC [[genome-wide association study]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirschfield GM, Liu X, Xu C, ''et al.'' |title=Primary biliary cirrhosis associated with HLA, IL12A, and IL12RB2 variants |journal=N.

In 2012, two independent PBC association studies increased the total number of genomic regions associated to 26, implicating many genes involved in [[cytokine]] regulation such as ''[[TYK2]]'', ''[[SH2B3]]'' and ''[[TNFSF11]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liu JZ, Almarri MA, Gaffney DJ, ''et al.'' |title=Dense fine-mapping study identifies new susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis |journal=Nat.

==Therapy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
There is no known cure, but medication may slow the progression so that a normal lifespan and quality of life may be attainable for many patients. Specific treatment for fatigue, which may be debilitating in some patients, is limited and currently undergoing trials.

* Ursodeoxycholic acid ([[Ursodiol]]) is the most frequently used treatment. This helps reduce the cholestasis and improves blood test results ([[liver function tests]]). It has a minimal effect on symptoms and whether it improves prognosis is controversial.

* To relieve itching caused by bile acids in circulation, which would normally be removed by the liver, [[cholestyramine]] (a [[bile acid sequestrant]]) may be prescribed to absorb bile acids in the gut and be eliminated, rather than re-enter the blood stream. Alternative agents include [[naltrexone]] and [[rifampicin]].

* To relieve fatigue associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, current studies indicate that Provigil (modafinil) may be effective without damaging the liver.<ref>[[Modafinil#Primary_biliary_cirrhosis]]<br/>{{cite journal |author=Ian Gan S, de Jongh M, Kaplan MM |title=Modafinil in the treatment of debilitating fatigue in primary biliary cirrhosis: a clinical experience |journal=Dig.

Screening and treatment of these complications is an important part of the management of PBC.

As in all liver diseases, excessive consumption of [[alcohol]] is contraindicated.

In advanced cases, a [[Liver transplantation|liver transplant]], if successful, results in a favorable prognosis.

==Epidemiology==
The female:male ratio is at least 9:1.  In some areas of the US and UK the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 1 in 4000. This is much more common than in South America or Africa, which may be due to better recognition in the US and UK.  First-degree relatives may have as much as a 500 times increase in prevalence, but there is debate if this risk is greater in the same generation relatives or the one that follows.<ref name="k&c-p155"/>

==Prognosis==
The serum [[bilirubin]] level is an indicator of the prognosis of primary biliary cirrhosis, with levels of 2–6&nbsp;mg/dL having a mean [[survival time]] of 4.1 years, 6–10&nbsp;mg/dL having 2.1 years and those above 10&nbsp;mg/dL having a mean survival time of 1.4 years.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|171117|Primary Biliary Cirrhosis|followup}}</ref>

After liver transplant, the recurrence rate may be as high as 18% at 5 years, and up to 30% at 10 years. There is no consensus on risk factors for recurrence of the disease.<ref name="k&c-p429">{{harvnb|Clavien|Killenberg|2006|p=429}}</ref>

Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have an increased risk of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].

==History==

Addison and Gull in 1851 described the clinical picture of progressive obstructive jaundice in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the large bile ducts. Ahrens ''et al'' in 1950 coined the term primary biliary cirrhosis for this disease. The association with anti mitochondrial antibodies was first reported in 1986.<ref name=Mitchison1986>{{cite journal |author=Mitchison HC, Bassendine MF, Hendrick A, ''et al.'' |title=Positive antimitochondrial antibody but normal alkaline phosphatase: is this primary biliary cirrhosis? |journal=Hepatology |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1279–84 |year=1986 |pmid=3793004 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840060609}}</ref>
