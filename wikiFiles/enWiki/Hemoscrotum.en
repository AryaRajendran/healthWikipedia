'''Hemoscrotum''' (or '''haemoscrotum''' in [[British English]]) is a condition in which blood accumulates inside the [[scrotum]].

Hemoscrotum can follow [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] (such as a [[straddle injury]]) or can be a complication of surgery. It cais often accompanied by [[testicular pain]]. It has been reported in patients with [[Haemophilia|hemophilia]] and following [[arterial catheter|catheterization]] of the [[femoral artery]]. If the diagnosis is not clinically evident, [[Transillumination#Medicine|transillumination]] (with a penlight against the scrotum) will show a non-translucent fluid inside the scrotum. [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound imaging]] may also be useful in confirming the diagnosis. In severe or non-resolving cases, surgical [[incision and drainage]] may be required. To prevent recurrence following surgical drainage, a [[drain (surgery)|drain]] may be left at the surgical site.
