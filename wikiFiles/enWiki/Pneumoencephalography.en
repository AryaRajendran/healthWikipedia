'''Pneumoencephalography''' (sometimes abbreviated PEG) was a [[medical procedure]] in which most of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] is drained from around the [[brain]] and replaced with air, oxygen, or helium to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an [[X-ray]] image. It was derived from [[ventriculography]], an earlier and more primitive method where the air is injected through holes drilled in the skull.

The procedure was introduced in 1919 by the American neurosurgeon [[Walter Dandy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Dandy|url=http://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=23991|work=Walter Dandy|publisher=Society of Neurological Surgeons|accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> 

Pneumoencephalography was performed extensively throughout the early 20th century, but it was extremely painful. The test was generally not well tolerated by patients. [[Headaches]] and severe vomiting were common side effects. Replacement of the drained spinal fluid is by slow natural production, and therefore required recovery for as long as 2â€“3 months before normal fluid volumes were restored. Video of the procedure is documented in a BBC documentary of an early EMI installation.  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_R47LDdlZM].     

Modern imaging techniques such as [[MRI]] and [[Computed tomography]] have rendered pneumoencephalography obsolete.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Mark|title=Handbook of Neurosurgery|year=2010|publisher=Thieme}}</ref> Today, pneumoencephalography is limited to the research field and is used under rare circumstances. A related procedure is [[pneumomyelography]], where gas is used similarly to investigate the [[spinal canal]]. 

Pneumoencephalography appears in popular culture in the movie ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), when Linda Blair's Regan MacNeil character undergoes the procedure. It is also referred to in Episode 7, Season 7 of House M.D. as an example of a dangerous procedure.
