'''Norman Rupert Barrett'''  (1903-1979) was an Australian-born British [[chest|thoracic]] [[surgeon]] who is primarily remembered for describing [[Barrett’s esophagus|Barrett’s oesophagus]].

==Early life==
Norman Barrett was born on 16 May 1903 in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], to Alfred and Catherine Barrett. His great uncle, James Barrett, was a doctor, and four of James's children became doctors. One of these children, Norman's uncle Sir James Barrett, was a founder of the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]] and a [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Melbourne University]].<ref>Norman Barrett and the esophagus by Reginald VN Lord, chapter from Barrett’s Esophagus, edited by HW Tilanus and SEA Attwood, 2001 ISBN 978-1-4020-0102-4</ref> He moved to England at the age of 10, and was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. He was given his lifelong nickname, Patsy, while at Eton.

==Career==
He trained at [[St Thomas' Hospital|St. Thomas’ Hospital]], and graduated in 1928. He continued as resident assistant surgeon at St. Thomas’ Hospital, and was elected as [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1930. He was awarded the postgraduate degree [[M Chir]] in 1931. In 1935, he became a [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant Surgeon]] at St. Thomas’, where he remained for the rest of his career.

He travelled to the United States of America on a [[Rockefeller Fellowship|Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship]] from 1935-6, working at the [[Mayo Clinic]], and visiting [[Boston]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Michigan]]. It was during this time that he decided to focus on [[thoracic surgery]], rather than gastrointestinal surgery as he had initially intended.

In 1946, he wrote a paper for the first issue of ''Thorax'' on spontaneous rupture of the [[esophagus|oesophagus]] ([[Boerhaave syndrome]]), in which he commented that ''"in the byways of surgery there can be few conditions more dramatic in their presentation and more terrible in their symptoms than spontaneous perforation of the oesophagus. No case has yet been treated successfully, and diagnosis has only been achieved in a very few before death"''.<ref>Barrett NR. Spontaneous perforation of the oesophagus. Review of the literature and report of three new cases Thorax 1946.1:103-6</ref> A year later, on 7 March 1947, he performed the first successful repair of a ruptured oesophagus.<ref>Barrett NR. Report of a case of spontaneous perforation of the oesophagus successfully treated by operation. Br J Surg 1947,35:218</ref>

In 1950, he published a paper in which he described the oesophagus as ''"that part of the [[foregut]], [[distal]] to the cricopharyngeal sphincter, which is lined by [[squamous epithelium]]"''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=BARRETT NR |title=Chronic peptic ulcer of the oesophagus and 'oesophagitis' |journal=Br J Surg |volume=38 |issue=150 |pages=175–82 |year=1950 |month=October |pmid=14791960 |doi= 10.1002/bjs.18003815005|url= |accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref>  In this paper, Barrett suggested that the finding of an oesophagus lined with [[Simple columnar epithelium|columnar epithelium]] (rather than the usual squamous epithelium) was due to the presence of a congenitally shortened oesophagus leading to a tubular portion of stomach being trapped in the chest. In this article Barrett also introduced the term [[esophagitis|reflux oesophagitis]], and described the development of benign [[esophageal stricture|oesophageal strictures]] in patients with this condition.

Allison and Johnstone argued that this [[columnar epithelium]]–lined structure was oesophagus and not stomach, and suggested that [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s in this structure be called "Barrett's ulcers".<ref>{{cite journal |author=ALLISON PR, JOHNSTONE AS |title=The oesophagus lined with gastric mucous membrane |journal=Thorax |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=87–101 |year=1953 |month=June |pmid=13077502 |pmc=1019247 |doi= 10.1136/thx.8.2.87|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13077502 |accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> Seven years after his initial article Barrett accepted this view, suggesting that it be called the ''"lower oesophagus lined by columnar epithelium"''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=BARRETT NR |title=The lower esophagus lined by columnar epithelium |journal=Surgery |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=881–94 |year=1957 |month=June |pmid=13442856 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref>  The columnar epithelium surrounding the chronic Barrett's ulcers has subsequently become known as Barrett's oesophagus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spechler SJ, Goyal RK |title=The columnar-lined esophagus, intestinal metaplasia, and Norman Barrett |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=614–21 |year=1996 |month=February |pmid=8566611 |doi= 10.1053/gast.1996.v110.agast960614|url= |accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref>

In addition to his work on oesophageal disease, Barrett also worked with Leonard Dudgeon, Professor of [[Pathology]] at the [[University of London]], on the [[Cytopathology|cytology]] of [[sputum]] in the diagnosis of [[Lung cancer|pulmonary malignancy]].<ref>Barrett NR. Examination of sputum for malignant cells and particles of malignant growth. J Thorac Surg, 1938;8:169-83</ref> He is also noted for his treatment of [[Echinococcosis|hydatid cysts]].<ref>Barrett NR. The treatment of pulmonary hydatid disease. Thorax 1947;2:21-57</ref>

Barrett was a lecturer in surgery for the [[University of London]] (1935-1970), Surgeon to [[King Edward VII]] [[Sanatorium]] in [[Midhurst]], [[Sussex]] (1938-1970), and Consulting Thoracic Surgeon to both the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance|Ministry of Social Security]] (1944-1970).<ref>[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=5587&inst_id=6 AIM25 archive of Norman Barrett]</ref> He edited ''Thorax'', the journal of thoracic surgery, from its inception in 1946 until 1971.

==Personal life==
Norman Barrett married Annabel Elizabeth "Betty" Warington Smyth on 21 April 1931. She was the sister of a school friend, and they had met six years previously. Betty had studied English and Art, and later became a novelist. They had two children, Julia and Althea. After Norman had been appointed a Consultant at St. Thomas’ Hospital, the Barrett family lived at 2 Dorset Street, [[Marylebone]], London for about 20 years. In 1954 they moved to [[Richmond Green]].

Outside his medical interests, he was also interested in the [[history of medicine]], drawing and painting, and was a keen sailor.

He was awarded the [[CBE]] in 1969, and retired in 1970. He died in London on 8 January 1979.
