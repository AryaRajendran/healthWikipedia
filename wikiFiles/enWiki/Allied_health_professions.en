'''Allied health professions''' are [[health care]] professions distinct from [[dentistry]], [[optometry]], [[nursing]], [[medicine]], and [[pharmacy]].<ref name='Association of Allied Health Schools'>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahp.org/definition.htm |title=Association of Allied Health Schools, Definition of Allied Health Professionals |publisher=Asahp.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> One estimate reported allied health professionals make up 60 percent of the total [[health workforce]].<ref name='University of California San Francisco'>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurehealth.ucsf.edu/Public/Center-Research/Home.aspx?pid=88 |title=University of California San Francisco, Advancing the Allied Health Professions |publisher=Futurehealth.ucsf.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> They work in health care teams to make the [[health care system]] function by providing a range of diagnostic, technical, therapeutic and direct [[patient]] care and support services that are critical to the other health professionals they work with and the patients they serve.

==Professions==
Definitions of allied health professions vary across countries and contexts, but generally indicate that they are health professions distinct from medicine, dentistry, optometry and nursing. Some definitions only include [[health care providers]] that require [[healthcare provider requisites|registration by law]] to practice, but usually all allied health professions that require a post-secondary degree or higher qualification are included.

Depending on the country and local health care system, a limited subset of the following professions (professional areas) may be represented, and may be regulated:

All professional areas ascribed before belong to the ever-growing group of allied health professionals and their subspecialties. The precise titles, roles, and [[Healthcare provider requisites|requisites]] of the allied health professions may vary considerably from country to country. For example, the National Council for Homeopathy of Pakistan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nchpakistan.com/ |title=National Council for Homeopathy of Pakistan |publisher=Nchpakistan.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> and the Central Council of Homeopathy of India<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cchindia.com |title=Central Council of Homeopathy of India |publisher=Cchindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> recognize as allied health professionals those who qualify with a four-year university degree in the discipline, whereas in other countries the practice of homeopathy is not subject to [[regulation and prevalence of homeopathy|professional regulation]].

However, it is more and more recognized that other professionals have a role to play in regard to healthcare. These include professionals such as youth workers, social workers, sexual health workers and school nurses. Not only do these practitioners have a key role to play due to their interaction with a wide range of the population but they may also have that opportunistic 'teachable' moment that allows them to impart health advice in a non-threatening manner.

==Training and education==

Some allied health professions are more specialized, and so must adhere to national training and education standards and their professional scope of practice. Often they must prove their skills through degrees, [[diplomas]], certified credentials, and continuing education. Other allied health professions require no special training or credentials and are trained for their work by their employer through on-the-job training (which would then exclude them from consideration as an Allied Health Profession in a country like Australia). Many allied health jobs are considered [[career ladder]] jobs because of the opportunities for advancement within specific fields.<ref name="BLS">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs035.htm#training|title=United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2010-04-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100420045930/http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs035.htm| archivedate= 20 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Allied health professions can include the use of many skills. Depending on the profession, these may include [[basic life support]]; medical [[terminology]], [[acronym]]s and [[spelling]]; basics of medical law and [[ethics]]; understanding of human relations; [[interpersonal communication]] skills; [[counseling]] skills; computer literacy; ability to document healthcare information; [[interviewing]] skills; and proficiency in [[word processing]]; [[database]] management and electronic dictation.<ref name="NHS AHP">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/ahp.shtml|title=Allied Health Professionals at NHS Careers|accessdate=2008-02-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080209223318/http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/ahp.shtml| archivedate= 9 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==History==
The explosion of scientific knowledge that followed [[World War II]] brought increasingly sophisticated and complex [[medicine|medical]] diagnostic and treatment procedures. Increasing public demand for medical services combined with higher health care costs provoked a trend toward expansion of service delivery from treating patients in hospitals to widespread provision of care in physician's private and group practices, ambulatory medical and emergency clinics, and mobile clinics and community-based care. In the developing world, international development assistance led to numerous initiatives for strengthening [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] capacity to deliver essential health care services. What followed has been an increase in the need for skilled health care delivery personnel worldwide.

Changes in the health industry and emphasis on cost-efficient solutions to health care delivery will continue to encourage expansion of the allied health workforce. The World Health Organization estimates there is currently a worldwide shortage of about 2 million allied health professionals (considering all health workers aside from medical and nursing personnel) needed in order to meet [[global health]] goals.<ref>World Health Organization (2006), ''The World Health Report 2006''. Geneva: World Health Organization.</ref>

In recognition of the growth of the number and diversity of allied health professionals in recent years, the newly adopted 2008 version of the [[International Standard Classification of Occupations]] has increased the number of groups dedicated to allied health professions. Depending on the presumed skill level, they may either be identified as “health professionals” or “health associate professionals”. For example, new categories have been created for delineating “paramedical practitioners” — grouping professions such as [[clinical officer]]s, [[clinical associates]], [[physician assistant]]s, [[Feldsher]]s, and [[Assistant Medical Officer|assistant medical officers]] — as well as for [[community health worker]]s; [[dietitian]]s and [[nutritionist]]s; audiologists and speech therapists; and others.<ref>Dal Poz MR et al. (2009), Boundaries of the health workforce: definition and classifications of health workers. In: ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health''. Geneva: World Health Organization.</ref>

==Allied health employment projections==

Projections in the United States and many other countries have shown an expected long-term shortage of qualified workers to fill many allied health positions. This is primarily due to expansion of the health industry due to demographic changes (a growing and aging population), large numbers of health workers nearing retirement, the industry’s need to be cost efficient, and a lack of sufficient investment in training programs to keep pace with these trends.<ref name="National Skills Coalition">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/assets/reports-/americasforgottenmiddleskilljobs_2007-11.pdf|title=National Skills Coalition, America's Forgotten Middle Skills Jobs Report|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref name="AAHC">{{cite web|url=http://www.aahcdc.org/policy/outoforderoutoftime.php|title=Association of Academic Health Centers Out of Order Out of Time Report|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>

Studies have also pointed to the need for increased [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in the allied health workforce to realize a [[Cultural competence|culturally competent]] health system in the United States<ref name="California Endowment">{{cite web|url=http://www.calendow.org/Collection_Publications.aspx?coll_id=30&ItemID=320|title=California Endowment, Workforce Diversity|accessdate=2010-04-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100525011153/http://www.calendow.org/Collection_Publications.aspx?coll_id=30&ItemID=320| archivedate= 25 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and elsewhere.

Workforce and health care experts anticipate that health services will increasingly be delivered via ambulatory and nursing care settings rather than in hospitals. According to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the health care industry consists of three main sub-sectors, divided by the types of services provided at each facility:<ref name="NAICS">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=62&search=2007%20NAICS%20Search|title=North American Industry Classification System|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>
* [[Hospital]]s: Primarily provides [[inpatient]] health services and may provide some [[outpatient]] services as a secondary activity. 
* [[Ambulatory care|Ambulatory health care]] settings: Primarily provides outpatient services at facilities such as doctors’ offices, outpatient [[clinic]]s and clinical laboratories. 
* [[Nursing home|Nursing and residential care facilities]]: Provides residential care, such as community care for the elderly or [[mental health]] and substance abuse facilities. 

In the US, a larger proportion of the allied health care workforce is already employed in ambulatory settings. In California, nearly half (49.4 percent) of the allied health workforce is employed in ambulatory health care settings, compared with 28.7 percent and 21.9 percent employed in hospital and nursing care, respectively.<ref name="California Health Jobs">{{cite web|url=http://www.calhealthjobs.org|title=California Health Jobs, Help Wanted Report, page 13|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>

Advancements in medical technology also allow for more services that formerly required expensive hospital stays to be delivered via ambulatory care. For example, in California, research has predicted the total consumption of hospital days per person will decline from 4 days in 2010 to 3.2 days in 2020 to 2.5 days in 2030. In contrast, the number of ambulatory visits per person will increase from 3.2 visits per person in 2010 to 3.6 visits per person in 2020 to 4.2 visits in 2030.<ref name="California Health Jobs">{{cite web|url=http://www.calhealthjobs.org|title=California Health Jobs, Help Wanted Report, page 14|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>  

In developing countries, many national [[Health Human Resources|human resources for health]] strategic plans and international development initiatives are focusing on scaling up training of allied health professions, such as HIV/AIDS counsellors, [[clinical officer]]s and [[community health worker]]s, in providing essential preventive and treatment services in ambulatory and community-based care settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepfar.gov/documents/organization/116294.pdf |title=PEPFAR Country Profile |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>

With this growing demand for ambulatory health care, researchers expect to witness a heavier demand for professions that are employed within the ambulatory sector and other non-hospital settings — in other words, allied health.<ref name="California Health Jobs">{{cite web|url=http://www.calhealthjobs.org|title=California Health Jobs, Help Wanted Report|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>
