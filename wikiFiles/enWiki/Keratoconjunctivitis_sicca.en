There may also be a stringy discharge from the eyes.<ref name=FDA-1/> Although it may seem strange, dry eye can cause the eyes to water.<ref name=FDA-1/> This can happen because the eyes are irritated.<ref name=FDA-1/> One may experience excessive tearing in the same way as one would if something got into the eye.<ref name=FDA-1/> These reflex tears will not necessarily make the eyes feel better.<ref name=FDA-1/> This is because they are the watery type that are produced in response to injury, irritation, or emotion.<ref name=FDA-1/> They do not have the lubricating qualities necessary to prevent dry eye.<ref name=FDA-1/>

Because blinking coats the eye with tears,<ref name=FDA-1/> symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes.<ref name=Merck-1/> These activities include prolonged reading,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> computer usage,<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=FDA-1/> driving,<ref name=Merck-1/> or watching television.<ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=FDA-1/> Symptoms increase in windy,<ref name=FDA-1/> dusty<ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=FDA-1/> or smoky (including cigarette smoke<ref name=FDA-1/>) areas,<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/> in dry environments,<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/> high altitudes including airplanes,<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> on days with low humidity,<ref name=Merck-1/> and in areas where an air conditioner<ref name=FDA-1/> (especially in a car<ref name=Merck-1/>), fan,<ref name=Merck-1/> heater,<ref name=Merck-1/> or even a hair dryer<ref name=FDA-1/> is being used. Symptoms reduce during cool, rainy, or foggy weather and in humid places, such as in the shower.<ref name=Merck-1/>

Most people who have dry eyes experience mild irritation with no long-term effects.<ref name=FDA-1/> However, if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe, it can produce complications that can cause eye damage,<ref name=FDA-1/> resulting in impaired vision or (rarely<ref name=Merck-1/>) in the loss of vision.<ref name=FDA-1/>

Symptom assessment is a key component of dry eye diagnosis - to the extent that many believe dry eye syndrome to be a symptom-based disease. Several questionnaires have been developed to determine a score that would allow for dry eye diagnosis. The [http://www.dipolarhosting.net/agingeye/dryeye.asp McMonnies & Ho dry eye questionnaire] is often used in clinical studies of dry eyes. It has 14 questions, resulting in a score from 0 to 45. Scores above 14.5 are consistent with dry eyes.

==Pathophysiology==
Having dry eyes for a while can lead to tiny [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on the surface of the eyes.<ref name=MedlinePlus-1/> In advanced cases, the [[epithelium]] undergoes pathologic changes, namely [[squamous metaplasia]] and loss of [[goblet cell]]s.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Some severe cases result in thickening of the corneal surface,<ref name=Merck-1/> corneal erosion,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> punctate [[Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy|keratopathy]],<ref name=eMedicine-1/> [[epithelium|epithelial]] defects,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> [[corneal ulcer]]ation (sterile and infected),<ref name=eMedicine-1/> corneal [[neovascularization]],<ref name=eMedicine-1/> corneal scarring,<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/> corneal thinning,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> and even corneal [[perforation]].<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

==Causes==
Any abnormality of any one of the three layers of [[tears]] produces an unstable tear film, resulting in symptoms of keratitis sicca.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

===Deficient tear production===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is usually due to inadequate tear production.<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/> The aqueous tear layer is affected, resulting in aqueous tear deficiency (ATD) or lacrimal hyposecretion.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> The [[lacrimal gland]] does not produce sufficient tears to keep the entire [[conjunctiva]] and [[cornea]] covered by a complete layer.<ref name=Merck-1/> This usually occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. Increased age is associated with decreased tearing.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> This is the most common type found in postmenopausal women.<ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=PE-1>{{cite journal | author=Sendecka M, Baryluk A, Polz-Dacewicz M | title=Prevalence and risk factors of dry eye syndrome | journal=Przegl Epidemiol | volume=58 | issue=1 | pages=227–33 | year=2004 | pmid=15218664}}</ref>

Causes include [[idiopathic]], congenital [[alacrima]], xerophthalmia, lacrimal gland [[ablation]], and sensory denervation.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> In rare cases, it may be a symptom of collagen vascular diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref name=Merck-1/> [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], and [[lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]].<ref name=eMedicine-1/> [[Sjögren's syndrome]]<ref name=Merck-1/> and [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]] associated with [[Sjögren's syndrome]] are also conditions associated with aqueous tear deficiency.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Drugs such as [[isotretinoin]],<ref name=Merck-1/> sedatives,<ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=MayoClinic-1/> diuretics,<ref name=Merck-1/> tricyclic [[antidepressants]],<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> [[antihypertensive]]s,<ref name=Merck-1/> [[oral contraceptive]]s,<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/> antihistamines,<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=FDA-1/> nasal decongestants,<ref name=FDA-1/> beta-blockers,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> phenothiazines,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> atropine,<ref name=eMedicine-1/> and pain relieving opiates such as morphine<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> can cause or worsen this condition. Infiltration of the lacrimal glands by [[sarcoidosis]] or tumors, or postradiation fibrosis of the lacrimal glands can also cause this condition.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

===Abnormal tear composition===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can also be caused by abnormal tear composition resulting in rapid evaporation<ref name=Merck-1/> or premature destruction of the tears.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> When caused by rapid evaporation, it is termed evaporative dry eyes.<ref name=Merck-1/> In this, although the tear gland produces a sufficient amount of tears, the rate of evaporation of the tears is too rapid.<ref name=Merck-1/> There is a loss of water from the tears that results in tears that are too "salty" or [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]]. As a result, the entire conjunctiva and cornea cannot be kept covered with a complete layer of tears during certain activities or in certain environments.<ref name=Merck-1/>

===Additional causes===
Aging is one of the most common causes of dry eyes.<ref name=FDA-1/> This is because tear production decreases with age.<ref name=FDA-1/> It may be caused by thermal or chemical burns, or (in epidemic cases) by [[adenovirus]]es. A number of studies have found that [[diabetes|diabetics]] are at increased risk for the disease.<ref name=Diabetic-1>{{cite journal | author=Kaiserman I, Kaiserman N, Nakar S, Vinker S | title=Dry eye in diabetic patients | journal=Am J Ophthalmol | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=498–503 | year=2005 | pmid=15767060 | doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2004.10.022}}</ref><ref name=Diabetic-2>{{cite journal | author=Li H, Pang G, Xu Z | title=Tear film function of patients with type 2 diabetes | journal=Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao | volume=26 | issue=6 | pages=682–6 | year=2004 | pmid=15663232}}</ref>

About half of all people who wear contact lenses complain of dry eyes.<ref name=FDA-1/> There are two potential connections between contact usage and dry eye.  Traditionally, it was believed that soft contact lenses, which float on the tear film that covers the cornea, absorb the tears in the eyes.<ref name=FDA-1/> However, it is also now known that contact usage damages corneal nerve sensitivity, which subsequently may lead to decreased lacrimal gland tear production and dry eye.  The effect of contact on corneal nerve sensitivity is well established for hard contacts as well as soft and rigid gas permeable.<ref name=Lenses-1>{{cite journal | author=Millodot M | title=Effect of long term wear of hard contact lenses on corneal sensitivity | journal=Arch Ophthalmol | volume=96 | issue=7 | pages=1225–7 | year=1978 | pmid=666631}}</ref><ref name=Lenses-2>{{cite journal | author=Macsai MS, Varley GA, Krachmer JH | title=Development of keratoconus after contact lens wear.

Dry eyes also occurs or gets worse after [[LASIK]] and other [[refractive surgery|refractive surgeries]], in which the corneal nerves are cut during the creation of a corneal [[flap (surgery)|flap]].<ref name=FDA-1/> The corneal nerves stimulate tear secretion.<ref name=FDA-1/> Dry eyes caused by these procedures usually resolves after several months, but it can be permanent.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Persons who are thinking about refractive surgery should consider this.<ref name=FDA-1/>

An eye injury or other problem with the eyes or [[eyelid]]s, such as bulging eyes or a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]] can cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca.<ref name=MedlinePlus-1/> Disorders of the eyelid can impair the complex blinking motion required to spread tears.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/>  Eye injury or disease leading to [[Boehm Syndrome]] may be exacerbated by dry eyes.

Abnormalities of the lipid tear layer caused by [[blepharitis]] and [[rosacea]], and abnormalities of the mucin tear layer caused by [[vitamin A]] deficiency, [[trachoma]], [[diphtheric keratoconjunctivitis]], mucocutaneous disorders and certain topical medications are causes of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

Persons with keratoconjunctivitis sicca have elevated levels of tear [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF).<ref name=eMedicine-1/> It is possible that this [[human eye|ocular]] surface NGF plays an important role in ocular surface inflammation associated with dry eyes.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

==Diagnosis==
Dry eyes can usually be diagnosed by the symptoms alone.<ref name=Merck-1/> Tests can determine both the quantity and the quality of the tears.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> A [[slit lamp]] examination can be performed to diagnose dry eyes and to document any damage to the eye.<ref name=eMedicine-1/><ref name=Merck-1/>

A [[Schirmer's test]] can measure the amount of moisture bathing the eye.<ref name=Merck-1/> This test is useful for determining the severity of the condition.<ref name=FDA-1/> A five-minute Schirmer's test with and without anesthesia using a Whatman #41 filter paper 5&nbsp;mm wide by 35&nbsp;mm long is performed.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> For this test, wetting under 5&nbsp;mm with or without anesthesia is considered diagnostic for dry eyes.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

If the results for the Schirmer's test are abnormal, a Schirmer II test can be performed to measure reflex secretion.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> In this test, the nasal mucosa is irritated with a cotton-tipped applicator, after which tear production is measured with a Whatman #41 filter paper.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> For this test, wetting under 15&nbsp;mm after five minutes is considered abnormal.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

A tear breakup time (TBUT) test measures the time it takes for tears to break up in the eye.<ref name=FDA-1/> The tear breakup time can be determined after placing a drop of [[fluorescein]] in the cul-de-sac.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

A tear protein analysis test measures the [[lysozyme]] contained within tears.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> In tears, lysozyme accounts for approximately 20 to 40 percent of total protein content.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

A lactoferrin analysis test provides good correlation with other tests.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

The presence of the recently described molecule Ap4A, naturally occurring in tears, is abnormally high in different states of ocular dryness. This molecule can be quantified biochemically simply by taking a tear sample with a plain Schirmer test. Utilizing this technique it is possible to determine the concentrations of Ap4A in the tears of patients and in such way diagnose objectively if the samples are indicative of dry eye.<ref>A.

Ophthalmol Vis Sci.47 (9):4053–4058 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pubmed]</ref>

More recently the Tear Osmolarity Test has been determined as the “gold standard” test for dry eye disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tomlinson|first=A|title=DEWS Report, Ocular Surface April 2007 Vol 5 No 2|year=2007|month=April|url=http://www.tearfilm.org/dewsreport/pdfs/TOS-0502-DEWS-noAds.pdf}}</ref> Tear osmolarity has been shown to be a more sensitive method of diagnosing and grading the severity of dry eye compared to corneal and conjunctival staining, tear break-up time, Schirmer test, and meibomian gland grading.<ref>{{cite journal|title=American Academy of Ophthalmology Cornea/External Disease Panel. 2011 Preferred Practice Pattern® (PPP) guidelines|year=2011|month=October|url=http://one.aao.org/CE/PracticeGuidelines/PPP_Content.aspx?cid=127dbdce-4271-471a-b6d9-464b9d15b748}}</ref> The TearLab Osmolarity System is the first objective and quantitative test for diagnosing and managing Dry Eye patients. The Tear Lab Osmolarity System, a lab-on-a-chip test that requires 50 nl of tears, is commercially available (Tear Lab Corp., San Diego, CA).

==Treatment==
A variety of approaches can be taken to treatment. These can be summarised as: avoidance of exacerbating factors, tear stimulation and supplementation, increasing tear retention, and eyelid cleansing and treatment of eye inflammation.<ref name=AJMC-1>

===General measures===
Dry eyes can be exacerbated by smoky environments, dust and air conditioning and by our natural tendency to reduce our blink rate when concentrating. Purposefully blinking, especially during computer use and resting tired eyes are basic steps that can be taken to minimise discomfort.<ref name=AJMC-1/> Rubbing one's eyes can irritate them further, so should be avoided.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Conditions such as [[blepharitis]] can often co-exist<ref name=AJMC-1/> and paying particular attention to cleaning the eyelids morning and night with mild shampoos and warm compresses can improve both conditions.

===Environmental control===
Dry, drafty environments and those with smoke and dust should be avoided.<ref name=Merck-1/> This includes avoiding hair dryers, heaters, air conditioners or fans, especially when these devices are directed toward the eyes.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Wearing glasses or directing gaze downward, for example, by lowering computer screens can be helpful to protect the eyes when aggravating environmental factors cannot be avoided.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Using a [[humidifier]],<ref name=Merck-1/><ref name=MedlinePlus-1/> especially in the winter,<ref name=MedlinePlus-1/> can help by adding moisture to the dry indoor air.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/><ref name=AJMC-1/>

===Rehydration===
For mild and moderate cases, supplemental lubrication is the most important part of treatment.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

====Artificial tears====
{{Main|Artificial tears}}

<!-- Expanding this section much is not recommended. Expand the main article instead. -->
Application of artificial tears every few hours<ref name=Merck-1/> can provide temporary relief.

==== Autologous serum eye drops ====
None of the commercially available artificial tear preparations include essential tear components such as [[epidermal growth factor]], [[hepatocyte growth factor]], [[fibronectin]], [[nerve growth factor|neurotrophic growth factor]], and [[vitamin A]]&mdash;all of which have been shown to play important roles in the maintenance of a healthy ocular surface epithelial milieu. Autologous serum eye drops contain these essential factors. However, there is some controversy regarding the efficacy of this treatment. At least one study<ref>{{cite PMID|18813071}}</ref> has demonstrated that this modality is more effective than artificial tears in a randomized control study.

====Additional options====
Lubricating tear ointments can be used during the day, but they generally are used at bedtime due to poor vision after application.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> They contain [[Petroleum jelly|white petrolatum]], [[mineral oil]], and similar lubricants.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> They serve as a lubricant and an [[emollient]].<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Application requires pulling down the eyelid and applying a small amount (0.25&nbsp;in) inside.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Depending on the severity of the condition, it may be applied from every hour to just at bedtime.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> It should never be used with contact lenses.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Specially designed glasses that form a moisture chamber around the eye may be used to create additional humidity.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/>

===Medication===
Inflammation occurring in response to tears film hypertonicity can be suppressed by mild topical [[steroid]]s or with topical [[immunosuppressant]]s such as [[Restasis]] ([[ciclosporin]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Tatlipinar S, Akpek E | title=Topical cyclosporine in the treatment of ocular surface disorders | journal=Br J Ophthalmol | volume=89 | issue=10 | pages=1363–7 | year=2005 | pmid=16170133 | doi=10.1136/bjo.2005.070888 | pmc=1772855}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Barber L, Pflugfelder S, Tauber J, Foulks G | title=Phase III safety evaluation of cyclosporine 0.1% ophthalmic emulsion administered twice daily to dry eye disease patients for up to 3 years | journal=Ophthalmology | volume=112 | issue=10 | pages=1790–4 | year=2005 | pmid=16102833 | doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2005.05.013}}</ref> Elevated levels of tear NGF can be decreased with 0.1% [[prednisolone]].<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

In each eye, there are two [[Lacrimal punctum|puncta]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980600ap/carter.html|title=Eyelid Disorders: Diagnosis and Management|publisher=American Academy of Family Physicians|accessdate=2011-01-07|author=Carter, Susan R.|year=1998}}</ref> — little openings that drain tears into the tear ducts.<ref name=FDA-1/> There are methods to partially or completely close the tear ducts.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> This blocks the flow of tears into the nose, and thus more tears are available to the eyes.<ref name=Merck-1/> Drainage into either one or both puncta in each eye can be blocked.

=====Punctal plugs=====

{{Main|Punctal plug}}
Punctal plugs are inserted into the puncta to block tear drainage.<ref name=FDA-1/> For people who have not found dry eye relief with drugs, punctal plugs may help.<ref name=FDA-1/> They are reserved for people with moderate or severe dry eye when other medical treatment has not been adequate.<ref name=FDA-1/>

=====Cauterization=====
If punctal plugs are effective, thermal<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> or electric<ref name=eMedicine-1/> [[cauterization]] of puncti can be performed. In thermal cauterization, a local anesthetic is used, and then a hot wire is applied.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> This shrinks the drainage area tissues and causes scarring, which closes the tear duct.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/>

====Customized contact lenses====
Persons with severe dry eyes may benefit from the Boston Scleral Lens which is a customized contact lens.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Resting on the [[sclera]], it creates a fluid filled layer over the cornea, thus preventing it from drying.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/>

====Surgery====
In severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, [[tarsorrhaphy]] may be performed where the eyelids are partially sewn together. This reduces the [[palpebral fissure]] (eyelid separation), ideally leading to a reduction in tear evaporation.<ref name=Merck-1/>

==Prognosis==
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca usually is a chronic problem.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Its [[prognosis]] shows considerable variance, depending upon the severity of the condition.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Most patients have mild-to-moderate cases, and can be treated symptomatically with lubricants.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> This provides an adequate relief of symptoms.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

When dry eyes symptoms are severe, they can interfere with quality of life.<ref name=FDA-1/> People sometimes feel their vision blurs with use,<ref name=Merck-1/> or severe irritation<ref name=Merck-1/> to the point that they have trouble keeping their eyes open<ref name=FDA-1/> or they may not be able to work or drive.<ref name=FDA-1/>

==Prevention==
There is no way to prevent keratoconjunctivitis sicca.<ref name=MedlinePlus-2>

==Epidemiology==
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is relatively common within the United States, especially so in older patients.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> Specifically, the persons most likely to be affected by dry eyes are those aged 40 or older.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/>

While persons with autoimmune diseases have a high likelihood of having dry eyes, most persons with dry eyes do not have an autoimmune disease.<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> Instances of Sjögren syndrome and keratoconjunctivitis sicca associated with it are present much more commonly in women, with a ratio of 9:1.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> In addition, milder forms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca also are more common in women.<ref name=eMedicine-1/> This is partly because hormonal changes,<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> such as those that occur in pregnancy, menstruation, and menopause,<ref name=MayoClinic-1/> can decrease tear production.<ref name=FDA-1/>

In areas of the world where malnutrition is common, vitamin A deficiency is a common cause.<ref name=MedlinePlus-2/> This is rare in the United States.<ref name=MedlinePlus-2/>

Racial predilections do not exist for this disease.<ref name=eMedicine-1/>

==Occurrence in animals==
Among animals, keratoconjunctivitis sicca occurs in dogs, cats, and horses.<ref name=Merck-2/>

===Dogs===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is common in [[dog]]s.  Most cases are caused by a [[genetics|genetic]] predisposition, but chronic [[conjunctivitis]], [[canine distemper]], and drugs such as [[sulfasalazine]] and [[co-trimoxazole|trimethoprim-sulfonamide]] also cause the disease.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N. (ed.)|title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}</ref>  Symptoms include eye redness, a yellow or greenish discharge, [[Corneal ulcer|ulceration of the cornea]], [[pigment]]ed cornea, and blood vessels on the cornea.  Diagnosis is made by measuring tear production with a [[Schirmer's test|Schirmer tear test]].  Less than 15 millimeters of tears produced in a minute is abnormal.<ref name=Gelatt_1999/>

Tear replacers are a mainstay of treatment, preferably containing [[methylcellulose]] or [[carboxymethyl cellulose]].<ref name=Gelatt_1999/>  Ciclosporin stimulates tear production and acts as a suppressant on the [[immune system|immune-mediated]] processes that cause the disease.  Topical [[antibiotic]]s and [[corticosteroid]]s are sometimes used to treat secondary infections and inflammation.  A surgery known as [[parotid duct]] transposition is used in some extreme cases where medical treatment has not helped.  This redirects the duct from the [[parotid gland|parotid salivary gland]] to the eye.  [[Saliva]] replaces the tears.  Dogs suffering from [[cherry eye]] should have the condition corrected to help prevent this disease.

Commonly affected breeds include:
*[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]]
*[[Bulldog]]
*[[Chinese Shar-Pei]]
*[[Lhasa Apso]]
*[[Shih Tzu]]
*[[West Highland White Terrier]]
*[[Pug]]
*[[Bloodhound]]
*[[Cocker Spaniel]]
*[[Pekingese]]
*[[Boston Terrier]]
*[[Miniature Schnauzer]]
*[[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]]<ref name=Gelatt_1999/>

===Cats===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is uncommon in [[cat]]s.  Most cases seem to be caused by chronic conjunctivitis, especially secondary to [[feline herpesvirus]].<ref name=Gelatt_1999/>  Diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment are similar to those for dogs.
