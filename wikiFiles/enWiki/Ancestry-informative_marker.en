[[Image:Bauchet European clusters.png|thumb|300px|AIMS can be used to identify five European "clusters"]]An '''ancestry-informative marker''' (AIM) is a set of polymorphisms for a locus, generally from humans, which exhibits substantially different frequencies between populations from different geographical regions.  

By using a number of AIMs one can estimate the geographical origins of the ancestors of an individual and ascertain what proportion of ancestry is derived from each geographical region.  By using a suite of these markers more or less evenly spaced across the genome, they can be used in a cost-effective way to discover novel genes underlying complex diseases in a technique called [[admixture mapping]] or mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium.  

There are an estimated 15 million SNP sites  (out of roughly 3 billion base pairs, or about 0.4%)   from among which AIMs may potentially be selected.<ref>Elizabeth Pennisi, Human Genetic Variation, ''Science'' 21 December 2007:
Vol. 318. no. 5858, pp. 1842 - 1843 {{doi|10.1126/science.318.5858.1842}} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5858/1842]</ref>

As one example, the [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]] Null allele (FY*0) has a frequency of almost 100% of Sub-Saharan Africans, but occurs very infrequently in populations outside of this region.  A person having this gene is thus more likely to have Sub-Saharan African ancestors.  

Collections of AIMs have been developed that can estimate the geographical origins of ancestors from within Europe.<ref name="Bauchet">Bauchet M, McEvoy B, Pearson L, Quillen E, Sarkisian T, Hovhannesyan K, Deka R, Bradley D, Shriver M. 2007.

Charles Rotimi, of [[Howard University]]'s National Human Genome Center, is among those who have highlighted the methodological flaws in such research &mdash; that "the nature or appearance of [[human genetic clustering]] (grouping) is a function of how populations are sampled, of how criteria for boundaries between clusters are set, and of the level of resolution used" all bias the results &mdash; and concluded that people should be very cautious about relating genetic lineages or clusters to their own sense of identity.<ref>Charles Rotimi (2003) "Genetic Ancestry Tracing and the African identity: A Double-Edged Sword?" in ''Developing World Bioethics'' 3(2): 153-154.</ref> (see also [[Race (classification of humans)|Race]])
