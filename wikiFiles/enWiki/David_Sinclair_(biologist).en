''' David A. Sinclair''' is a [[biologist]] best known for his research on the biology of lifespan extension and driving research towards treating diseases of aging.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12207953 | work=BBC News | title=Stop, rewind: the scientists slowing the ageing process | date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>

==Current position==
Sinclair is Professor of Pathology and Co-Director of the [[Paul F. Glenn]] Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard Medical School.  Sinclair obtained a Bachelors of Science (Honors Class I) at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, and received the Australian Commonwealth Prize. In 1995, he received a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT with [[Leonard Guarente]] before being recruited in 1999 to [[Harvard Medical School]].

==Research==
One of Sinclair's discoveries was in the lab of [[Leonard Guarente]] where he identified the key role of [[Extrachromosomal rDNA circle|rDNA circles]] or "ERCs" in determining the lifespan of yeast.<ref>(Guarente and Sinclair, Cell, 1997)</ref> Subsequent research showed that ERCs are unique to aging in a particular yeast strain, and not involved in aging in any other organisms. ERCs were subsequently shown to be suppressed by the [[SIR2]] gene, the founding member of the [[sirtuin]] gene family, as well as deletion of the [[senescence|FOB1]] gene. With Kevin Mills and Lenny Guarente, he also showed that the Sir2 protein relocalizes to DNA breaks and mediates repair.<ref>

 | quote = The yeast [[sirtuin|Sir2/3/4p]] complex is found in abundance at [[telomeres]], where it participates in the formation of silent heterochromatin and telomere maintenance. Here, we show that Sir3p is released from telomeres in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), binds to DSBs, and mediates their repair, independent of cell mating type. Sir3p relocalization is S phase specific and, importantly, requires the DNA damage checkpoint genes MEC1 and RAD9. MEC1 is a homolog of ATM, mutations in which cause [[ataxia telangiectasia]] (A-T), a disease characterized by various neurologic and immunologic abnormalities, a predisposition for cancer, and a cellular defect in repair of DSBs. This novel mode by which preformed DNA repair machinery is mobilized by DNA damage sensors may have implications for human diseases resulting from defective DSB repair
 }}</ref>  These two discoveries led his lab to discover that genomic instability induces changes in gene regulation  may drive the aging process in mammals.<ref>(Oberdoerffer, Cell, 2008)</ref>

In 2002, Sinclair's lab at Harvard discovered a key role of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis in aging.<ref>(Anderson, JBC, 2002)</ref> In 2003, his lab published that nicotinamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of Sir2 and [[SIRT1]], and proposed the molecule as a physiological regulator of Sirtuins.<ref>(Bitterman et al., JBC, 2003)</ref> 

Sinclair is also credited with the "[[Mitochondrial Oasis Hypothesis]]" which states that the energetics and NAD<sup>+</sup> content of mitochondria determines cell survival in the face of genotoxic stress (i.e. DNA damage), independent of the state of the cytoplasm or nucleus.<ref>(Yang et al., Cell, 2007)</ref> He is also known for his hypothesis developed with Konrad Howitz called the "[[Xenohormesis]] Hypothesis" which states that animals have evolved to sense stress signalling molecules in other species, in order to gain advance warning of a deteriorating environment.<ref>(Howitz and Sinclair, Cell, 2008)</ref> 

Sinclair is credited with co-discovering [[Sirtuin]] activating compounds [[sirtuin activating compound|STACs]] with Konrad Howitz of Biomol Inc. In September 2003, Howitz and Sinclair et al., published a highly cited paper reporting that polyphenols such as [[resveratrol]] activate human [[SIRT1]] and extend the lifespan of budding yeast (Howitz et al., Nature, 2003). In collaboration with two Drosophila aging experts, Marc Tatar and Stephen Helfand (Brown University), he co-published that resveratrol extends the lifespan of worms and flies in a SIR2-dependent manner.<ref>(Wood et al., Nature, 2004)</ref> This effect was found not reproducible by other investigators ([[Linda Partridge]] and [[David Gems]]). In a more recent study by Sinclair, published in November 2006 by the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] indicated that [[resveratrol]] had life-extending activity in mice fed a high fat Western diet (60% fat). These obese mice lived considerably shorter than normally fed mice, and that obese mice treated with resveratrol lived an average of 15% longer than obese mice not treated with resveratrol. A later study showed that resveratrol mimics the diets known as calorie restriction (CR) in normally fed mice and slowed down diseases of aging such as cardiovascular disease, cataracts, and diabetes (however, no effect on overall lifespan was evident). Molecules that are orders of magnitude more potent that resveratrol have been developed and shown efficacy in mouse models of obesity and diabetes (Milne et al., Nature, 2007; Feige et al., Cell Metabolism, 2008). However, key results from these studies have proved irreproducible by independent investigators. When queried on these, Sinclair questioned the ability of these independent investigators to synthesize these compounds.  The first of these potent [[sirtuin activating compound|STACs]] is in Phase I human trials.

==Awards and recognition==
Dr. Sinclair has received several awards including a [[Helen Hay Whitney Foundation|Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Award]], and a Special Fellowship from the Leukemia Society, a Ludwig Scholarship, a Harvard-Armenise Fellowship, an American Association for Aging Research Fellowship, and a Scholarship from the [[Ellison Medical Foundation]]. In 2003, one of his papers was considered a "Discovery of the Year" by Discover magazine. In 2004, he won the Genzyme Outstanding Achievement in Biomedical Science Award. In 2006 he was awarded the [[Telluride Tech Festival]] Award of Technology and voted one of Australia's Top 10 scientists under 45, and co-authored the cover article of the March '06 issue of Scientific American. In 2007, he won an award for teaching excellence at Harvard Medical School. His work has appeared in most major newspapers, radio, and television including ABC, CNN, CNBC, Nova, Barbara Walters' Special, and 60 Minutes Australia.-->

== Sirtris Pharmaceuticals==
In 2004, Sinclair co-founded [[Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]] with [[Christoph Westphal]],<ref>[http://www.sirtrispharma.com/about.html About Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]</ref> to develop drugs that harness the body's own defenses against diseases of ageing. Sirtris was featured on the cover of Fortune magazine in Jan 2007.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/02/05/8399158/index.htm Fortune archive]</ref>

[[Michelle Dipp]] since led the acquisition of Sirtris by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in 2008 for $720 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/2008/04/22/sirtris-exec-says-acquisition-by-glaxosmithkline-is-great-for-boston/ |title=Michelle Dipp’s interview with Xconomy.com regarding the GSK acquisition of Sirtris|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>
