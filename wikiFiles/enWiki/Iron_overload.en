In [[medicine]], '''iron overload''' indicates accumulation of [[iron]] in the body from any cause. The most important causes are [[hereditary haemochromatosis]] (HHC), a genetic disorder, and [[Transfusion hemosiderosis|transfusional iron overload]], which can result from repeated [[blood transfusion]].

==Terminology==
===Haemochromatosis or haemosiderosis===
Historically, the term '''haemochromatosis''' (spelled '''hemochromatosis''' in [[American English]]) was initially used to refer to what is now more specifically called [[haemochromatosis type 1]] (or [[HFE (gene)|HFE]]-related hereditary haemochromatosis). Currently, haemochromatosis (without further specification) is mostly defined as iron overload with a hereditary/primary cause,<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hemochromatosis thefreedictionary.com > hemochromatosis], citing: 
*''The American Heritage Medical Dictionary'', 2004 by Houghton Mifflin Company
*''McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine''. 2002
</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/hemochromatosis Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary > hemochromatosis] Retrieved on Dec 11, 2009</ref> or originating from a metabolic disorder.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hemochromatosis thefreedictionary.com], citing: 
*''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers'', 2007
*''Mosby's Medical Dictionary'', 8th edition. 2009
*Jonas: ''Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine''. 2005.
</ref> However, the term is currently also used more broadly to refer to any form of iron overload, thus requiring specification of the cause, for example, ''hereditary haemochromatosis''.  Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with estimated prevalence in the population of 1 in 200 among patients with European ancestry, with lower incidence in other ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hemochromatosis | url = http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hemochromatosis/index.htm}}</ref> The gene responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis (known as HFE gene) is located on chromosome 6; the majority of hereditary haemochromatosis patients have mutations in this HFE gene. Hereditary haemochromatosis is characterized by an accelerated rate of intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron deposition in various tissues that typically begins to be expressed in the third to fifth decades of life, but may occur in children. The most common presentation is hepatic [[cirrhosis]] in combination with [[hypopituitarism]], [[cardiomyopathy]], [[diabetes]], [[arthritis]], or [[hyperpigmentation]]. Because of the severe sequelae of this disorder if left untreated, and recognizing that treatment is relatively simple, early diagnosis before symptoms or signs appear is important.<ref name="pmid20542038">{{cite journal |last1=Pietrangelo |first1=Antonello |title=Hereditary Hemochromatosis: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=139 |issue=2 |pages=393–408 |year=2010 |pmid=20542038 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2010.06.013}}</ref><ref name="pmid10488796">{{cite journal |last1=Brandhagen |first1=D J |last2=Fairbanks |first2=V F |last3=Batts |first3=K P |last4=Thibodeau |first4=S N |title=Update on hereditary hemochromatosis and the HFE gene |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=917–21 |year=1999 |pmid=10488796 |doi=10.4065/74.9.917}}</ref> 
In general, the term '''[[haemosiderosis]]''' is used to indicate the pathological effect of iron accumulation in any given organ, which mainly occurs in the form of [[haemosiderin]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/hemosideroses Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary > hemosideroses] Retrieved on Dec 11, 2009</ref><ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hemosiderosis thefreedictionary.com > hemosiderosis], citing:

*''Mosby's Medical Dictionary'', 8th edition.</ref> Sometimes, the simpler term '''[[siderosis]]''' is used instead.

==Clinical presentation==
Organs commonly affected by haemochromatosis are the [[liver]], [[heart]], and endocrine glands.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Nancy C. |title=Disorders of Iron Metabolism |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=341 |issue=26 |pages=1986–95 |year=1999 |pmid=10607817 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199912233412607}}</ref>

Haemochromatosis may present with the following clinical syndromes:<ref>{{Cite book|title=General Practice|author=John Murtagh|publisher=McGraw Hill Australia|year=2007|isbn=0-07-470436-2}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>

==Causes==
The causes can be distinguished between primary cases (hereditary or genetically determined) and less frequent secondary cases (acquired during life).<ref name="pmid12651879">{{cite journal |last1=Pietrangelo |first1=A |title=Haemochromatosis |journal=Gut |volume=52 |pages=ii23–30 |year=2003 |pmid=12651879 |pmc=1867747 |doi=10.1136/gut.52.suppl_2.ii23 |issue=90002}}</ref> People of [[Celts|Celtic]] (Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish, Breton etc.), [[British people|British]], and [[Scandinavia]]n origin<ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/the-iron-in-our-blood-that-keeps-and-kills-us/266936/?single_page=true The Atlantic: "The Iron in Our Blood That Keeps and Kills Us" by Bradley Wertheim] January 10, 2013</ref> have a particularly high incidence of whom about 10% are carriers of the gene and 1% sufferers from the condition.

Most types of hereditary haemochromatosis have [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance, while type 4 has [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance.<ref name="pmid16493621">{{cite journal |last1=Franchini |first1=Massimo |title=Hereditary iron overload: Update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment |journal=American Journal of Hematology |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=202–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16493621 |doi=10.1002/ajh.20493}}</ref>

===Secondary haemochromatosis===
* Severe chronic [[haemolysis]] of any cause, including intravascular haemolysis and [[ineffective erythropoiesis]] (haemolysis within the [[bone marrow]]).
* Multiple frequent [[blood transfusion]]s (either whole blood or just [[red blood cell]]s), which are usually needed either by individuals with hereditary [[anaemia]]s (such as [[Thalassemia#Beta (?) thalassemias|beta-thalassaemia major]], [[sickle cell anaemia]], and [[Diamond&ndash;Blackfan anaemia]]) or by older patients with severe acquired anaemias such as in [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]s.
* Excess parenteral iron supplements, such as what can acutely happen in [[iron poisoning]]
* Excess dietary iron
* Some disorders do not normally cause haemochromatosis on their own, but may do so in the presence of other predisposing factors. These include [[cirrhosis]] (especially related to [[alcohol abuse]]), [[steatohepatitis]] of any cause, [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], prolonged [[haemodialysis]], post-[[portacaval shunt]]ing.

==Diagnosis==
There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring iron loading including:
*	[[Serum ferritin]]
*	[[Liver biopsy]]
*	[[HFE (gene)|HFE]]
*	[[MRI]]

Serum ferritin is a low-cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of iron overload is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer. Also, [[total iron binding capacity]] may be low, but can also be normal.<ref>[http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/tibc/test.html labtestsonline.org > TIBC & UIBC, Transferrin] Last reviewed on October 28, 2009.</ref>

The standard of practice in diagnosis of haemochromatosis was recently reviewed by Pietrangelo.<ref name="pmid20542038"/> Positive HFE analysis confirms the clinical diagnosis of haemochromatosis in asymptomatic individuals with blood tests showing increased iron stores, or for predictive testing of individuals with a family history of haemochromatosis. The alleles evaluated by HFE gene analysis are evident in ~80% of patients with haemochromatosis; a negative report for HFE gene does not rule out haemochromatosis.  In a patient with negative HFE gene testing, elevated iron status for no other obvious reason, and family history of liver disease, additional evaluation of liver iron concentration is indicated.  In this case, diagnosis of haemochromatosis is based on biochemical analysis and histologic examination of a liver biopsy. Assessment of the hepatic iron index (HII) is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosis of haemochromatosis.

MRI is emerging as an alternative to liver biopsy for measuring liver iron loading. For measuring liver iron concentrations, '''R2-MRI''' (also known as '''FerriScan''')<ref>http://www.ferriscan.com/</ref><ref name="pmid15256427">{{cite journal |last1=St. Pierre |first1=T.

Family members of those diagnosed with primary haemochromatosis may be advised to be screened genetically to determine if they are a carrier or if they could develop the disease. This can allow preventative measures to be taken.

==Prognosis==
A third of those untreated develop [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref>{{Fitzpatrick 6|184}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Routine treatment in an otherwise-healthy person consists of regularly scheduled phlebotomies ([[bloodletting]]). When first diagnosed, the phlebotomies may be fairly frequent, perhaps as often as once a week, until iron levels can be brought to within normal range.  Once iron and other markers are within the normal range, phlebotomies may be scheduled every other month or every three months depending upon the patient's rate of iron loading.

For those unable to tolerate routine blood draws, there is a [[chelating]] agent available for use. The drug [[Deferoxamine]] binds with iron in the bloodstream and enhances its elimination via urine and faeces. Typical treatment for chronic iron overload requires subcutaneous injection over a period of 8–12 hours daily.  Two newer iron chelating drugs that are licensed for use in patients receiving regular blood transfusions to treat thalassaemia (and, thus, who develop iron overload as a result) are [[deferasirox]] and [[deferiprone]].
