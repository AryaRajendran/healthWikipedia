{{For|his son of the same name|Britton Chance, Jr.}}
'''Britton Chance''' (July 24, 1913 – November 16, 2010) was the Eldridge Reeves Johnson University Professor Emeritus of [[Biochemistry]] and [[Biophysics]], as well as [[Professor Emeritus]] of Physical Chemistry and Radiological Physics at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].

At the 1952 Summer Olympics, Chance won a gold medal in sailing.

==Early life and education==
Chance was born in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (1935), [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] (1936), and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[Physical Chemistry]] 1940 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was a member of [[St. Anthony Hall]].

Chance earned a second Ph.D. at [[Cambridge University]] in 1942 in Biology/[[Physiology]].

==Career==
During World War II, Chance worked for the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] which was working on the development of radar. In 1952, he received his [[D.Sc.]] from Cambridge.

His research interests were diverse. He was promoted as the Professor of Biophysics at [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] and appointed the second director of the Johnson Foundation, a position he held until 1983. He was then appointed E. R. Johnson Professor of Biophysics and Physical Biochemistry (later renamed as Biochemistry and Biophysics) in 1964 and University Professor in 1977. 

In his early career, he was mainly working on enzyme structure and function. He had invented the now standard stopped flow device to measure the existence of the enzyme-substrate complex in enzyme reaction.<ref>[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/279/50/e10 Kresge N, Simoni RD, Hill RL. Britton Chance: Olympian and Developer of Stop-Flow Methods. J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 279, Issue 50, 10, December 10, 2004.]</ref> In later years, while retaining his interest in those fields, he also focused on metabolic control phenomena in living tissues as studied by noninvasive technique such as phosphorus NMR and optical spectroscopy and fluorometry, including the use of [[infrared]] light to characterize the properties of various [[biological tissue|tissues]] and breast [[tumor]]s.<ref>[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/chance_britton.html University of Pennsylvania Archival Collection]</ref> 

===Olympic===
He won a gold medal for the United States at the [[Sailing at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]] in the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5½ Meter Class]], alongside [[Edgar White]] and [[Sumner White]].<ref>[http://www.ussailing.org/Olympics/usmedals.htm US Sailing Medalists]</ref>

==Awards and recognitions==
Chance joined the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 1952. He received the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1974.<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=72 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref> He was also previously elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], Medical Sciences, in 1968, as well as a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]] (London) in 1981.  He died in the [[Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania]], Philadelphia in November 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title = Britton Chance, Olympian and Biophysics Researcher, Dies at 97|last=Weber| first=Bruce|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/us/29chance.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries|newspaper =The New York Times|publisher =|date = 2010-11-28|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5udny0RCG| archivedate = 2010-11-30| accessdate =2010-11-30}}</ref>

===Awards named after Britton Chance===
*The International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue ([[ISOTT]]) established The Britton Chance Award in honor of Professor Chance's long-standing commitment, interest and contributions to the science and engineering aspects of oxygen transport to tissue and to the society.  This award was first presented in 2004 during the annual conference of ISOTT in Bari, Italy.<ref>[http://www.isott.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24&Itemid=67 ISOT Awards]</ref>
*SPIE has established Britton Chance Biomedical Optics Award, honoring his significant contribution to biomedical optics. The award will be presented annually to recognize outstanding contributions to the field of biomedical optics through the development of innovative, high-impact biophotonic technologies. In particular, the award will acknowledge pioneering contributions to biophotonic methods and devices that have significant promise to accelerate or have already facilitated new discoveries in biology or medicine, and will target achievements that span disciplines and may include elements of basic research, technology development, and clinical translation.<ref>[http://spie.org/x43410.xml SPIE honors Britton Chance with new biomedical optics award]</ref>
