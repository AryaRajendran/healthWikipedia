Some degree of fusion of the [[labioscrotal folds]] and [[urogenital folds]] and [[clitoromegaly|clitoral enlargement]] can occur if exposure occurs from the 8th through the 12th week of [[gestational age|gestation]], but only clitoral enlargement can occur if exposure occurs after the 12th week.<!--

This can in some cases result in [[ambiguous genitalia]].<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/>

Fetal masculinization of female external genitalia is usually due to enzyme abnormalities involved in [[adrenal cortex|adrenal]] [[steroid hormone|steroid biosynthesis]], resulting in [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH); fetal masculinization of female external genitalia is much less frequently due to maternal use of androgenic steroids.<!--
 --><ref name="Jaffe 2004"/><!--
 --><ref name="Forest 2006"/>

Fetal masculinization of female external genitalia due to maternal use of androgenic steroids is generally less advanced than that due to CAH, and unlike CAH, does not cause progressive virilization.<!--

Affected females [[puberty|mature]] normally with normal [[fertility]], there is almost total regression of the genital anomaly in cases of simple clitoral enlargement, and in even the most severe cases, [[genital reconstructive surgery|surgical]] correction of labioscrotal fusion is relatively simple.<!--
  --><ref name="Schardein 1980"/>

== Dosage ==

The incidence of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia varies with the drug and dosage.<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/>

=== Androgens ===

The only [[sex steroid]] currently utilized in women that can cause virilization of female fetuses when administered in usually administered doses is the androgen [[danazol]], a derivative of [[ethisterone]] (17α-ethinyl-testosterone).<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/>

Fetal masculinization of female external genitalia has resulted from doses of danazol as low as 200 mg/day, whereas 800 mg/day is the usual initial dose when danazol is used to treat severe [[endometriosis]].<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/>

=== Progestogens ===

In general, [[pregnane]] derivatives ([[progesterone]], [[dydrogesterone]], [[17-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate|17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate]], [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]], [[megestrol acetate]], etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; [[testosterone]] derivatives ([[ethisterone]]) and 19-nortestosterone ([[norethisterone]], [[norethindrone acetate|norethisterone acetate]], etc.) generally virilize, but there are exceptions (e.g. [[norethynodrel]]) that do not.<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/>

The only progestogens currently used during pregnancy (for [[luteal support]] in [[in vitro fertilisation|IVF]] protocols or for prevention of [[premature birth|preterm birth]] in pregnant women with a history of at least one spontaneous preterm birth) are:  progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, and dydrogesterone.<!--

Doses of 19-nortestosterones required for virilization are 10-20 mg/day, far in excess of that associated with inadvertent [[hormonal contraception|contraceptive]] exposure during pregnancy.<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/>
Genital ambiguity due to progestogen exposure is thus mostly a topic of historical concern.<!--
 --><ref name="Simpson 1998"/><!--

== History ==

=== Androgens ===

The first drugs reported to cause fetal masculinization were the androgens methandriol and [[methyltestosterone]] in the mid 1950s.<!--

On June 21, 1976, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved the androgen danazol (''Danocrine''), a derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethinyl-testosterone), for treatment of endometriosis, with a warning that its use in pregnancy is contraindicated because of the risk of masculinization of external genitalia of female fetuses.<!--

The first case report of fetal masculinization of the external genitalia of a female infant born to a mother inadvertently treated in pregnancy with danazol was published in 1981.<!--

Between 1975 and 1990, ''Danocrine'''s manufacturer, [[Sterling Drug|Winthrop Laboratories]], received reports worldwide of 129 pregnant women exposed to danazol, with 94 completed pregnancies and the birth of 57 female infants — 23 (40%) of whom were virilized with a pattern of clitoromegaly, fused labia and urogenital sinus formation, with genital reconstructive surgery usually, but not always, required in childhood.
It is likely that the true rate of occurrence is much less than 40%, as many cases with a normal outcome would not be reported. No genital anomalies were reported where danazol therapy was discontinued before the 8th week of pregnancy.<!--

The warnings against use of danazol were progressively strengthened in the 1980s. In 1991 the FDA required a [[black box warning]] that use of danazol in pregnancy is contraindicated because exposure to danazol in utero may result in androgenic effects on the female fetus causing external genitalia masculinization. The black box warning recommends a sensitive [[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]]-beta-subunit [[pregnancy test]] immediately prior to starting danazol therapy and use of a nonhormonal method of [[contraception]] during therapy.<!--

As of 2000, there had been published reports of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia in:<!--
 --><ref name="Schardein 2000"/>
* 23 cases associated with danazol (all from inadvertent use from 1975-1990)
* 13 cases associated with methandriol (all from use in the 1950s and 1960s)
* 11 cases associated with methyltestosterone (all from use in the 1950s and 1960s)

=== Progestogens ===

==== Past use for prevention of miscarriage ====

In the 1940s, some studies suggested that progesterone could prevent [[Miscarriage#Forms and types|threatened abortion]] and might prevent [[habitual abortion]], but oral [[bioavailability]] of progesterone is low and injections of progesterone can be painful, so orally active progestins were tried beginning with [[ethisterone]], followed by other progestins as they became available: northynodrel (''Enovid'') and norethisterone (''Norlutin'') in 1957, medroxyprogesterone acetate (''Provera'') in 1959, norethisterone acetate (''Norlutate'') in 1961, and dydrogesterone (''Duphaston'') in 1962.<!--

The first case reports of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born to mothers treated in pregnancy with high-dose ethisterone (17α-ethinyl-testosterone) and high-dose norethisterone (17α-ethinyl-19-nor-testosterone) to prevent miscarriage were published in 1957 and 1958, respectively.<!--

In a March 1960 ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'' article, [[pediatric endocrinology|pediatric endocrinologist]] [[Lawson Wilkins]] at [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins]] reported on 34 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1950 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (20-250 mg/day) ethisterone to prevent miscarriage, and 35 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1957 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (10-40 mg/day) norethisterone to prevent miscarriage.<!--

In 1961, [[Novartis|Ciba]] and [[Parke-Davis]] added the reported association of ethisterone and norethisterone with masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus to the precautions section of their advertisements to physicians and physician prescribing information.<!--

A clinical trial published in the October 1962 ''American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology'' reported fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 14 of 59 female infants (24%) born to mothers who began high-dose (10-40 mg/day) norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (11 infants had slight clitoral enlargement, 1 had marked clitoral enlargement, 2 infants had marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds); fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 1 of 23 female infants born to mothers who began high-dose (10-40 mg/day) norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage after the 12th week of pregnancy (1 infant with slight clitoral enlargement was born to a mother who began norethisterone treatment in week 13).<!--

In 1964, Parke-Davis revised the physician prescribing information for ''Norlutin'' (norethisterone) and ''Norlutate'' (norethisterone acetate) to remove their indications for use in infertility, habitual abortion and threatened abortion, and add pregnancy as a contraindication to their use because of the possibility of masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus.<!--

In 1977, the FDA determined that there was no adequate evidence that progestogens (including progesterone, dydrogesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate) were effective in treating threatened abortion or preventing habitual abortion and withdrew approval for those indications.<!--

On January 12, 1989, after determining that progestogens did ''not'' cause non-genital birth defects, the FDA published a notice revising the black box warning on all progestogen drugs (except contraceptives) to warn against their use during the first four months of pregnancy because of past reports of genital birth defects (an increased risk of [[hypospadias]] in male fetuses and mild virilization of the external genitalia in female fetuses).<!--
