'''Klazomania''' (from the Greek κλάζω ("klazo")—to scream) refers to compulsive shouting;<ref name=Jankovic>{{cite journal |author=Jankovic J, Mejia NI |title= Tics associated with other disorders |journal=Adv Neurol |year=2006 |volume=99 |page=66 |pmid= 16536352}}</ref> it has features resembling the complex [[tic]]s such as [[echolalia]], [[palilalia]] and [[coprolalia]] seen in [[tic disorder]]s, but has been seen in people with [[encephalitis lethargica]], alcohol abuse and [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].<ref name=wohlfart /> It was first reported by L. Benedek in 1925 in a patient with [[postencephalitic parkinsonism]].<ref name=bates />  Little is known about the condition, and few cases have been reported.<ref name=bates/>

==Classification==
Klazomania shares some features with vocal [[tic]]s seen in [[tic disorder]]s including [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS).<ref name=bates/><ref name=Jankovic/> Klazomania was described in a 2006 journal review as a cause of tics differentiated from TS ([[tourettism]]), attributed to infectious processes (encaphalitis) rather than TS.<ref name=Jankovic/> A 1996 case report on one patient by Bates ''et al'' suggested klazomania was a vocal tic.<ref name=bates/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Klazomania is similar to other complex tics including [[echolalia]], [[palilalia]] and [[coprolalia]].<ref name=Jankovic/> It is defined as compulsive shouting, which can be in the form of swearing, grunting or barking.<ref name=bates /> The subject may appear flushed, and klazomania can occur with increasing frequency if the person is agitated.<ref name=bates /> The duration of the incident depends on the individual, but it can be characterized by a peak period, followed by intermittent remissions of less intensity.<ref name=wohlfart /> Although the individual may sound like they are in pain, there does not appear to be any actual physical discomfort.<ref name=bates /> The shouting can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as [[oculogyric crisis|oculogyric crises]] or other involuntary movements.<ref name=wohlfart /> The presentation of klazomania has been compared to [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], although the two can be distinguished by the duration of the attack and the fact that the patient experiencing klazomania appears to retain consciousness.<ref name=wohlfart /> 

A 1961 report by Wohlfart described a postman known as K.R. who contracted [[encephalitis lethargica]] at the age of 12.<ref name=wohlfart /> While he reported no significant ill effects from the disease, he was irritable and complained of fatigue for years after recovering. At 22, the patient received a head injury, though he did not sustain a concussion or cranial fracture from the incident.  Six months later, he developed oculogyric spasms, as well as [[dyskinesia]]s of the mouth and tongue.<ref name=wohlfart /> At the age of 44, the patient experienced his first bout of klazomania.<ref name=wohlfart /> He remained conscious for the entire incident, while he shouted for about half an hour and appeared "crazy" for hours after the shouting ended. The next day, he felt better, though he did report being tired.  The patient continued to suffer from the attacks for the next few years before coming under observation of Wohlfart and colleagues. He subsequently served as a model to describe klazomania from beginning to end.<ref name=wohlfart /> 

According to Wohlfart's account of one patient, onset is sometimes characterized by absentmindedness:  the patient K.R. stared straight ahead and only responded in monosyllables in the minutes leading up to the incident.<ref name=wohlfart /> An oculogyric spasm then developed, during which he demonstrated [[echolalia]]. After 15 minutes, further motor symptoms arose, with the patient making small jerky motions with his arms that developed into larger, circular movements. At 20 minutes, the attack reached its peak, with the patient becoming bright red and making large compulsive movements with his arms and kicking his legs. He began swearing, shouting, screaming, grunting and barking loudly, with intermittent bouts of heavy panting. He remarked upon the people present, with his comments being related to the situation in question. He attempted at times to excuse his behavior. Afterwards the patient was able to provide an account of what had happened. Wohlfart ''et al.'' concluded that the patient was aware of his surroundings during the attack, with the patient even expressing concern over missing a scheduled appointment; the patient demonstrated some ability to control his behavior when spoken to in a sharp tone, but he would inevitably return to his shouting and movements after a few seconds of stillness. The episode lasted an hour and a half and was accompanied by salivation, sweating, and [[tachycardia]]. The peak of the attack lasted 30 minutes; the intensity then started to subside, though the patient still exhibited bouts of shouting and movement after several minutes of remission.<ref name=wohlfart /> The remission periods between the shouting episodes became longer, until the entire attack was over in about an hour and a half.<ref name=wohlfart />

==Causes==
Although the cause of klazomania is unknown, it is considered to be associated with encephalitis lethargica; a 2006 journal review by Jankovic and Mejia attributes klazomania to [[tourettism]] (tics not due to Tourette syndrome), widely seen after the [[1918 flu pandemic|encephalitic lethargica pandemic]] of 1916 to 1927.<ref name= Jankovic/>

Wohlfart (1961) hypothesized that klazomania is caused by an irritating lesion in the [[mesencephalon]] and a malfunction in the control of the motor circuit from the [[substantia nigra]] in the mesencephalon to the [[globus pallidus]] in the [[striatum]] (mesostraital pathway). This circuit becomes overstimulated during a mesencephalic "fit".<ref name=wohlfart /> 

In a 1996 report of one case, Bates ''et al.'' postulated that klazomania is similar to the vocal tics of [[Tourette syndrome]], although patients with klazomania may not have the motor tics necessary for a diagnosis of TS.<ref name=bates/> Bates and colleagues observed a case where alcoholism and [[encephalitis]] were accompanied by vocal tics and occasionally klazomania.<ref name=bates /> They hypothesized that the cause of klazomania is linked to the combined effects of brain damage due to alcoholism or encephalitis.<ref name=bates />

==Pathophysiology==
Jankovic and Mejia's 2006 review indicated that autopsies of victims of the 1917 to 1926 encepahlitis lethargica pandemic revealed "neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss in the [[globus pallidus]], [[hypothalamus]], midbrain [[tegmentum]], [[periaqueductal gray]] matter, [[striatum]], and the [[substantia nigra]]".<ref name=Jankovic/>

Wohlfart ''et al'' hypothesized that klazomania originates in the periaqueductal gray matter in the mesencephalon.<ref name=wohlfart /> The vocalizing center in animals is located in the periaqueductal gray matter and a klazomania-like episode involving grunts and animal sounds can be evoked by electrical stimulation of this region.<ref name=wohlfart /> Wohlfart and colleagues hypothesized that the stimulation of the autonomic nervous system by the posterior hypothalamus is involved in klazomania, adding that klazomania resembles [[sham rage]] in animals, which is controlled by stimulation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. During klazomania, a person may experience [[pupil dilation]], [[tachycardia]], [[salivation]], increased blood pressure, retraction of lips, barking, grunting, and rage just as an animal would if presenting sham rage.<ref name=wohlfart /> Bates and colleagues (1996) say that neuroimaging and pathology results do not support evidence of hypothalamic involvement similar to that found in sham rage.<ref name=bates/>

== Diagnosis ==
Jankovic and Mejia describe klazomania as due to [[tourettism]] (tics having Tourette syndrome-like features but not due to TS).  According to the revised fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), Tourette's may be diagnosed when the other diagnostic criteria are met and symptoms cannot be attributed to another general medical condition.<ref name=BehaveNet>[[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000). [http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/touretteTR.htm DSM-IV-TR: Tourette's Disorder.] ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', 4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), ISBN 0-89042-025-4. Available at BehaveNet.com Retrieved on August 10, 2009.</ref>   Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as [[tourettism]]—must be ruled out before a TS diagnosis can be conferred. There are no specific tests; the diagnosis is based on history and symptoms.<ref name=phenomenology>{{cite journal|author= Leckman JF, Bloch MH, King RA, Scahill L |title= Phenomenology of tics and natural history of tic disorders |journal=Adv Neurol |year= 2006 |volume=99 |pages=1–16 |pmid= 16536348}}</ref>

According to Bates (1996), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) abnormalities are not observed during klazomania, and a link between klazomania and [[seizure]]s is not likely.<ref name=bates/>

==Treatment==
In large doses, [[atropine sulfate]] helped control the involuntary movements associated with klazomania in one patient; attempts to treat with a combination of [[phenobarbital]] and [[trihexyphenidyl]] (also known as Artane) were also made. Phenobarbital acts as an anticonvulsant and is generally used to treat seizures, while Artane is used to treat involuntary movements in [[Parkinson's disease]]; however, this combination was found to have no beneficial effect in treating klazomania.<ref name=wohlfart /> Klazomania does not respond to anti-epileptic medications.<ref name=bates/>

==History==
The word "klazomania" comes from the Greek κλάζω ("klazo"), meaning "to scream".<ref name=bates>{{cite journal|author=Bates GDL, Lampert I, Prendergast M, Van Woerkom AE |year=1996 |title=Klazomania: the screaming tic |journal=Neurocase |volume=2  |issue=1 |pages=31–34 |doi=10.1080/13554799608402386}}</ref> The term was coined by L. Benedek in 1925 when he witnessed bouts of compulsive shouting in a patient with [[postencephalitic parkinsonism]].<ref name=bates /> He reported that the attacks would last for up to several hours and seemed to be outside of the patient's control. He characterized the shouting as extremely loud, noting that it could be in the form of syllables, vowels or even animal noises. In addition, he observed that while the nature of the shouting could suggest that the patient was in pain, the sounds themselves were unrelated to any physical discomfort. He stated that the patient appeared to have the ability to anticipate an incident and could even prevent it through deep and rapid breathing. However, he noted that the effort required to suppress klazomania could be even more tiring than enduring it. He said that though anxiety could increase the frequency of klazomania, it did not affect the overall presentation.<ref name=bates /> 

Two of Benedek’s colleagues, E. Von Thurzó and T. Katona, recorded two further instances of klazomania in 1927.<ref name=bates /> They expanded upon Benedek’s earlier observations, describing the angry flushed face of one patient, as well as extreme restlessness and agitation. They noted that afterwards the patient apologized for the incident, suggesting awareness of the behavior. From this, Thurzó and Katona proposed that there is no loss of consciousness during klazomania and that individuals may remain fully aware of their surroundings.<ref name=bates />
 
One of the first instances in which an infectious disease was associated with klazomania was the notable pandemic of the encephalitis lethargica from 1916 to 1927.<ref name=Jankovic/> This pandemic also gave rise to observations of other tics that came to be associated with encephalitis lethargica such as complex vocalizations of blocking, echolalia, palilalia, and oculogyric crises.<ref name=Jankovic/> 

In 1961, Wohlfart ''et al.'' reported a case of klazomania accompanied by [[oculogyric crises]], another symptom of postencephalitic Parkinsonian syndrome.<ref name="wohlfart">{{cite journal |author=Wohlfart G, Ingvar DH, Hellberg AM |title=Compulsory shouting (Benedek's "klazomania") associated with oculogyric spasms in chronic epidemic encephalitis |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=36 |issue= |pages=369–77 |year=1961 |pmid=13786189 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1961.tb01051.x}}</ref> Klazomania was proposed to be associated with chronic alcohol abuse and carbon monoxide poisoning in 1996.<ref name=bates /> Bates ''et al.'' reported on a 63-year-old who was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with a two-year history of sudden episodes of shouting.  The man claimed to have no memory of the attacks, which he could anticipate by a few seconds. The episodes were characterized by shouting of "aagh" or "help" and he was reported to appear angry during the incidents. At the end of the outbursts he would appear surprised, though he was able to continue a conversation. The patient remained fully oriented between attacks. The episodes themselves occurred at a frequency of one or two a month, generally taking place in the evening and they got progressively worse from the time of their first presentation.<ref name=bates />

The observation of klazomania in encephalitis patients helped establish the neurological underpinning of tics in other conditions, including Tourette syndrome.<ref>{{cite book| author= Larner AJ |publisher= Springer Netherlands |title= A Dictionary of Neurological Signs |chapter=K| year= 2002 |pages= 121–23 |doi= 10.1007/0-306-47505-7_11}}</ref>
