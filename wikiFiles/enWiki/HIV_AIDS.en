<!--Signs and symptoms -->
'''Human immunodeficiency virus infection''' / '''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome''' ('''HIV/AIDS''') is a [[disease]] of the human [[immune system]] caused by infection with [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV).<ref name="pmid11396444">{{Cite journal|author=Sepkowitz KA|title=AIDS—the first 20 years|journal=N.

This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including [[opportunistic infection]]s and [[tumors]] that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems.

<!--Transmission and prevention -->
HIV is [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] primarily via unprotected [[sexual intercourse]] (including [[anal sex|anal]] and even [[oral sex]]), contaminated [[blood transfusion]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and [[vertical transmission|from mother to child]] during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.<ref name=CDCtransmission>{{cite web|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|year=2003|url=http://www.cdc.gov/HIV/pubs/facts/transmission.htm|title=HIV and Its Transmission|accessdate=May 23, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204141148/http://www.cdc.gov/HIV/pubs/facts/transmission.htm|archivedate=February 4, 2005}}</ref> Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through [[safe sex]] and [[needle-exchange program]]s, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease.<!--Treatment -->
There is no cure or [[HIV vaccine|vaccine]]; however, [[antiretroviral|antiretroviral treatment]] can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and may be associated with side effects.

<!--History and Epidemiology -->

{{Main|Signs and symptoms of HIV/AIDS}}
There are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency and AIDS.<ref name=M121>Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010).

=== Acute infection ===
[[File:Symptoms of acute HIV infection.svg|thumb|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of an acute HIV infection|275px|Main symptoms of acute HIV infection]]
The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.<ref name=M121/><ref name=WHOCase2007/> Many individuals develop an [[influenza-like illness]] or a [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis-like illness]] 2–4 weeks post exposure while others have no significant symptoms.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diseases and disorders.|year=2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=Tarrytown, NY|isbn=978-0-7614-7771-6|page=25|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=-HRJOElZch8C&pg=PA25}}</ref><ref name=M118/> Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy|large tender lymph nodes]], [[pharyngitis|throat inflammation]], a [[rash]], headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.<ref name=WHOCase2007/><ref name=M118/> The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is [[maculopapular]], classically.<ref name=Deut2010/> Some people also develop [[opportunistic infections]] at this stage.<ref name=WHOCase2007/> Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or [[diarrhea]] may occur, as may neurological symptoms of [[peripheral neuropathy]] or [[Guillain-Barre syndrome]].<ref name=M118/> The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.<ref name=M118/>

Due to their [[Nonspecific_symptoms#Types|nonspecific]] character, these symptoms are not often [[Medical_diagnosis#Pattern_recognition|recognized]] as signs of HIV infection.<!--<ref name=M118/> --> Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common [[infectious disease]]s with overlapping symptoms.<!--<ref name=M118/> --> Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in patients presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.<ref name=M118>Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010). Chapter 118.</ref>

=== Clinical latency ===
The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.<ref name=AIDS2010GOV/> Without treatment, this second stage of the [[Natural history of disease|natural history]] of HIV infection can last from about three years<ref>{{cite book|last=Evian|first=Clive|title=Primary HIV/AIDS care: a practical guide for primary health care personnel in a clinical and supportive setting|year=2006|publisher=Jacana|location=Houghton [South Africa]|isbn=978-1-77009-198-6|page=29|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=WauaC7M0yGcC&pg=PA29|edition=Updated 4th}}</ref> to over 20&nbsp;years<ref>{{cite book|first=J.

Although most [[HIV-1]] infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells ([[T helper cell]]s) without [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]] for more than 5 years.<ref name=M118/><ref name=LT2010/> These individuals are classified as HIV controllers or [[long-term nonprogressors]] (LTNP).<ref name=LT2010>{{cite journal|last=Blankson|first=JN|title=Control of HIV-1 replication in elite suppressors|journal=Discovery medicine|date=2010 Mar|volume=9|issue=46|pages=261–6|pmid=20350494}}</ref> Another group is those who also maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment who are known as "elite controllers" or "elite suppressors".<!--<ref name=Walker2007/> --> They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.<ref name=Walker2007>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=BD|title=Elite control of HIV Infection: implications for vaccines and treatment.|journal=Topics in HIV medicine : a publication of the International AIDS Society, USA|date=2007 Aug–Sep|volume=15|issue=4|pages=134–6|pmid=17720999}}</ref>

=== Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome===
[[File:Symptoms of AIDS.svg|thumb|275px|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of AIDS|Main symptoms of AIDS.]]

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined in terms of either a CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection.<ref name=M118/> In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.<ref name=M118/> The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] (40%), [[cachexia]] in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%) and [[esophageal candidiasis]].<ref name=M118/> Other common signs include recurring [[respiratory tract infection]]s.<ref name=M118/>

<!--Opportunistic infections -->
[[Opportunistic infections]] may be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]] and [[parasite]]s that are normally controlled by the immune system.<ref name=Holmes>{{Cite journal|author=Holmes CB, Losina E, Walensky RP, Yazdanpanah Y, Freedberg KA|title= Review of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-related opportunistic infections in sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Clin.

<!--AIDS related cancers -->
People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral induced cancers including: [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], [[primary central nervous system lymphoma]], and [[cervical cancer]].<ref name=Deut2010/> Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV.<ref name=M169>Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010). Chapter 169.</ref> The second most common cancer is lymphoma which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%.<ref name=M169/> Both these cancers are associated with [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|human herpesvirus 8]].<ref name=M169/> Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS due to its association with [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).<ref name=M169/>

<!--Systemic symptoms -->
Additionally, people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers, [[Night sweats|sweats]] (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, and [[weight loss]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AIDS|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000594.htm|work=MedlinePlus|publisher=A.D.A.M.|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> Diarrhea is another common symptom present in about 90% of people with AIDS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sestak K |title=Chronic diarrhea and AIDS: insights into studies with non-human primates |journal=Curr.

== Transmission ==
{{Risk of acquiring HIV}}
HIV is transmitted by three main routes: [[human sexual activity|sexual contact]], exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as [[vertical transmission]]).<ref name=TransmissionM2007>{{cite book|last=Markowitz|first=edited by William N.

=== Sexual ===
<!--Overview -->
The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> The majority of all transmissions occur through [[heterosexual]] contacts (i.e. sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex);<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> however, the pattern of transmission varies significantly among countries. In the United States, as of 2009, most sexual transmission occurred in [[men who had sex with men]],<ref name=TransmissionM2007/> with this population accounting for 64% of all new cases.<ref name=TransmissionCDC2012>{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: An Overview|url=http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/us_overview.htm|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|date=March 2012}}</ref>

<!--Per act risk -->
As regards [[unprotected sex|unprotected]] heterosexual contacts, estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.<ref name=Boily2009/> In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission.<ref name=Boily2009/> The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.4{{ndash}}1.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts.<ref name=Boily2009/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beyrer|first=C|coauthors=Baral, SD; van Griensven, F; Goodreau, SM; Chariyalertsak, S; Wirtz, AL; Brookmeyer, R|title=Global epidemiology of HIV infection in men who have sex with men.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Jul 28|volume=380|issue=9839|pages=367–77|pmid=22819660|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60821-6}}</ref> While the risk of transmission from [[oral sex]] is relatively low, it is still present.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=M|coauthors=Vajdy, M|title=Mucosal HIV transmission and vaccination strategies through oral compared with vaginal and rectal routes|journal=Expert opinion on biological therapy|date=2010 Aug|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1181–95|pmid=20624114|doi=10.1517/14712598.2010.496776|pmc=2904634}}</ref> The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as "nearly nil"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stürchler|first=Dieter A.|title=Exposure a guide to sources of infections|year=2006|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781555813765|page=544|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=MWa5or3Xa9EC&pg=PA544}}</ref> however a few cases have been reported.<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by Richard Pattman ...

Two [[Subtypes of HIV|types of HIV]] have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more [[virulence|virulent]], more [[infectivity|infective]],<ref>{{cite journal | title=Comparison of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infectivity from a prospective cohort study in Senegal | last=Gilbert | first=PB |journal=Statistics in Medicine | date=28 February 2003| volume=22 | issue=4 | pages=573–593 | pmid=12590415 |doi=10.1002/sim.1342 | last2=McKeague | first2=IW | last3=Eisen | first3=G | last4=Mullins | first4=C | last5=Guéye-Ndiaye| first5=A | last6=Mboup | first6=S | last7=Kanki | first7=PJ | display-authors=1}}</ref> and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally.

===Classifications of HIV infection===
Two main clinical staging systems are used to classify HIV and HIV-related disease for [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] purposes: the [[WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease]],<ref name=WHOCase2007/> and the [[CDC classification system for HIV infection]].<ref name=CDCCase2008/> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.<ref name=M121/><ref name=WHOCase2007/><ref name=CDCCase2008/>

The World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.<ref name=WHOCase2007/> Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.<ref name=WHOCase2007>{{cite book|title=WHO case definitions of HIV for surveillance and revised clinical staging and immunological classification of HIV-related disease in adults and children.|pages=6–16|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/HIVstaging150307.pdf|format=PDF|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-159562-9}}</ref> The WHO system uses the following categories:
* Primary HIV infection: May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage I: HIV infection is [[asymptomatic]] with a CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500/uL.<ref name=WHOCase2007/> May include generalized lymph node enlargement.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage II: Mild symptoms which may include minor [[Mucous membrane|mucocutaneous]] manifestations and recurrent [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s. A CD4 count of less than 500/uL.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage III: Advanced symptoms which may include unexplained [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[diarrhea]] for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/uL.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>
* Stage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms which include [[toxoplasmosis]] of the brain, [[candidiasis]] of the [[esophagus]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchus|bronchi]] or [[lung]]s and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. A CD4 count of less than 200/uL.<ref name=WHOCase2007/>

The United States [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] also created a classification system for HIV, and updated it in 2008.<ref name=CDCCase2008>{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=E|coauthors=Whitmore, S; Glynn, KM; Dominguez, K; Mitsch, A; McKenna, MT; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC)|title=Revised surveillance case definitions for HIV infection among adults, adolescents, and children aged <18 months and for HIV infection and AIDS among children aged 18 months to <13 years--United States, 2008|journal=MMWR.

Recommendations and reports / Centers for Disease Control|date=2008-12-05|volume=57|issue=RR–10|pages=1–12|pmid=19052530}}</ref> This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms,<ref name=CDCCase2008/> and describes the infection in three stages:

*Stage 3: CD4 count ≤ 200&nbsp;cells/µl or AIDS defining conditions
*Unknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications

For surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.<ref name="M121"/>

By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for [[government spending|public expenditure]]s such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.<ref name=Greener />

At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households with an HIV/AIDS patient, spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.<ref name="WBank">

=== Religion and AIDS ===
{{Main|Religion and HIV/AIDS}}
The topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial in the past twenty years, primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/AIDS-Stigma.aspx |title=AIDS Stigma |publisher=News-medical.net |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Thirty years after AIDS discovery, appreciation growing for Catholic approach">{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/thirty-years-after-aids-discovery-appreciation-growing-for-catholic-approach/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+catholicnewsagency%2Fdailynews+%28CNA+Daily+News%29 |title=Thirty years after AIDS discovery, appreciation growing for Catholic approach |publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com |date=June 5, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref> The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled ''The Catholic Church and the Global Aids Crisis'' argues that cultural changes are needed including a re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it.<ref name="Thirty years after AIDS discovery, appreciation growing for Catholic approach"/>

Some religious organisations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to a number of deaths.<ref name=BBC18102011>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertise an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication.<ref name=BBC18102011 />

One of the first high-profile cases of AIDS was the American [[Rock Hudson]], a gay actor who had been married and divorced earlier in life, who died on 2 October 1985 having announced that he was suffering from the virus on 25 July that year.

There are many [[misconceptions about HIV and AIDS]]. Three of the most common are that AIDS can spread through casual contact, that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS, and that HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users. Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to HIV infection, and that open discussion of homosexuality and HIV in schools will lead to increased rates of homosexuality and AIDS.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Blechner MJ| title=Hope and mortality: psychodynamic approaches to AIDS and HIV| publisher=Analytic Press| location=Hillsdale, NJ| year=1997| isbn=0-88163-223-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kirby DB, Laris BA, Rolleri LA |title=Sex and HIV education programs: their impact on sexual behaviors of young people throughout the world |journal=J Adolesc Health |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=206–17 |year=2007|month=March |pmid=17321420 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.11.143 |url=}}</ref>

== Research ==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}
HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of [[HIV]] as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

HIV/AIDS research includes following the usual advice given by doctors in responding to HIV. The most universally recommended method for the [[prevention of HIV/AIDS]] is to avoid blood-to-blood contact between people and to otherwise practice [[safe sex]]. The most recommended method for treating HIV is for [[HIV-positive people]] to receive attention from a doctor who would coordinate the patient's [[management of HIV/AIDS]]. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS.

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]] such as [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccines]], and [[antiretroviral drugs]]. Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], and [[Circumcision and HIV]].
