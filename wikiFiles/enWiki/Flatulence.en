'''Flatulence''' is defined in the medical literature as "flatus expelled through the anus" or the "quality or state of being flatulent",<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flatulence Flatulence]</ref> which is defined in turn as "marked by or affected with gases generated in the intestine or stomach; likely to cause digestive flatulence."<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/flatulent Flatulent]</ref> The root of these words is from the Latin ''flatus'' - "a blowing, a breaking wind".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=flatulent Flatulent]</ref> Flatus is also the medical word for gas generated in the stomach or bowels.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/flatus Flatus]</ref> These standard definitions do not reflect the fact that a proportion of intestinal gas may be composed of swallowed environmental air, and hence flatus is not totally generated in the stomach or bowels. The scientific study of this area of medicine is termed '''flatology'''.<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /> 

It is normal for humans to pass flatus per rectum, although the amount and the frequency may vary greatly between individuals. It is also normal for intestinal gas passed per rectum to have a characteristic [[wiktionary:feculent|feculent]] odor, although this too may vary in concentration. Flatus is brought to the rectum by specialized contractions of the muscles in the intestines and colon. The noises commonly associated with flatulence ("[[Blowing a raspberry]]") are caused by the vibration of the [[Anus|anal]] [[sphincter]], and occasionally by the closed [[buttocks]]. Both the noise and odor associated with flatus leaving the anus can be sources of embarrassment or comedy in many cultures.

There are 4 general symptoms related to intestinal gas, pain, bloating and abdominal distension, excessive flatus volume, excessive flatus odor and gas incontinence. Furthermore, [[eructation]] ("an act or instance of belching", colloquially known as "burping") is sometimes included under the topic of flatulence.<ref name="K C clinical medicine">{{cite book|last=Clark]|first=[edited by Parveen Kumar, Michael|title=Kumar & Clark clinical medicine|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0702027634|pages=266|edition=6th ed.}}</ref> 

Non medical definitions of the term include "the uncomfortable condition of having gas in the stomach and bowels", "A state of excessive gas in the alimentary canal". These definitions highlight that many people consider "bloating", [[abdominal distension]] or increased volume of intestinal gas to be synonymous with the term flatulence (although this is technically inaccurate). Colloquially, flatulence may be referred to as "farting", "passing gas", "breaking wind" or simply (in [[American English]]) "gas" or ([[British English]]) "wind".

==Physiology==

===Production, composition, and odor===
Flatus (intestinal gas) is mostly produced as a byproduct of bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the colon.<ref name="Tomlin 1991" /> There are reports of aerophagia (excessive air swallowing) causing excessive intestinal gas, but this is considered rare.<ref name="Hemmink 2009">{{cite journal|last=Hemmink|first=GJ|coauthors=Weusten, BL; Bredenoord, AJ; Timmer, R; Smout, AJ|title=Aerophagia: excessive air swallowing demonstrated by esophageal impedance monitoring.|journal=Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association|date=2009 Oct|volume=7|issue=10|pages=1127–9|pmid=19602452|doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2009.06.029}}</ref> >99% of the volume of flatus is composed of non-odorant gases.<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /> These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Nitrogen is not produced in the gut, but a component of environmental air. Patients who have excessive intestinal gas that is mostly composed of nitrogen may have aerophagia.<ref name="Levitt 1998" /> Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are all produced in the gut and contribute 74% of the volume of flatus in normal subjects.<ref name="Suarez 1997" /> [[Methane]] and [[hydrogen]] are [[flammable]], and so flatus containing adequate amounts of these can be [[Fart lighting|ignited]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} However, not all humans produce flatus that contains methane. For example, in one study of the [[feces]] of nine adults, only five of the samples contained [[archaea]] capable of producing methane.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Miller TL| coauthors=Wolin MJ, de Macario EC, Macario AJ| title=Isolation of Methanobrevibacter smithii from human faeces| journal=Appl Environ Microbiol| year=1982| volume=43| pages=227–32 |pmid=6798932 |pmc=241804 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6798932| issue=1}}</ref>

The remaining trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its odor. Historically, compounds such as [[indole]], [[skatole]], [[ammonia]] and [[short chain fatty acids]] were thought to cause the odor of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the odor of flatus comes from a combination of volatile [[sulfur compounds]] (VSC).<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /><ref name="Suarez 1998">{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=FL|coauthors=Springfield, J; Levitt, MD|title=Identification of gases responsible for the odour of human flatus and evaluation of a device purported to reduce this odour.|journal=Gut|date=1998 Jul|volume=43|issue=1|pages=100–4|pmid=9771412|pmc=1727181}}</ref> It is known that [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S), [[methyl mercaptan]] (MM, methanethiol, MT), [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS), [[dimethyl disulfide]] (DMDS) and [[dimethyl trisulfide]] (DMTS) are present in flatus. The Benzopyrrole volatiles indole & skatole actually have a mothball type odor,<!-- <ref name="Moore 1987" /> ref name not defined--> and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic odor of flatus.

In one study, H<sub>2</sub>S concentration was shown to correlate convincingly with perceived malodor of flatus, followed by MM and DMS.<ref name="Levitt 1998" /> This is supported by the fact that H<sub>2</sub>S may be the most abundant VSC present. However, these results were generated from subjects who were eating a diet high in [[pinto beans]] to stimulate flatus production. Others report that MM was the greatest contributor to the odor of flatus in patients not on under any specific dietary alterations.<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /><!-- <ref name="Moore 1987" /> no ref name defined --> It has now been demonstrated that MM, DMS and H<sub>2</sub>S (described as decomposing vegetables, unpleasantly sweet/wild radish and rotten eggs respectively) are all present in human flatus in concentrations above their odor perception thresholds.<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /> Furthermore, it is known that increased dietary sulfur containing amino acids significantly increases the odor of flatus. It is therefore likely that the odor of flatus is created by a combination of VSC, with minimal contribution from non sulfur volatiles.<ref name="Levitt 1998" />

The incidence of odoriferous compounds in flatulence emissions increases from [[herbivores]], such as [[cattle]], through [[omnivores]] to [[carnivorous]] [[species]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. Such odor can also be caused by the presence of large numbers of microflora [[bacteria]] and/or the presence of feces in the rectum. Diets high in protein, especially sulfur containing amino acids have been demonstrated to significantly increase the odor of flatus.

===Normal flatus volume and intestinal gas dynamics===
Normal flatus volume range is around 476 to 1491ml per 24 hours.<ref name="Tangerman 2009">{{cite journal|last=Tangerman|first=Albert|title=Measurement and biological significance of the volatile sulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide in various biological matrices|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|date=1 October 2009|volume=877|issue=28|pages=3366–3377|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2009.05.026|pmid=19505855}}</ref><ref name="Tomlin 1991">{{cite journal|last=Tomlin|first=J|coauthors=Lowis, C; Read, NW|title=Investigation of normal flatus production in healthy volunteers.|journal=Gut|date=1991 Jun|volume=32|issue=6|pages=665–9|pmid=1648028|pmc=1378885}}</ref> This variability between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet.

This process it thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.<ref name="Azpiroz 2005" />

Researchers investigating the role of sensory nerve endings in the anal canal did not find them to be essential for retaining fluids in the anus, and instead speculate that their role may be to distinguish between flatus and feces, thereby helping detect a need to defecate or to signal the end of defecation.<ref>{{cite journal

The sound varies depending on the tightness of the sphincter [[muscle]] and [[velocity]] of the [[gas]] being propelled, as well as other factors, such as water and body fat. The auditory pitch (sound) of the flatulence outburst can also be affected by the anal [[embouchure]]. Among humans, flatulence occasionally happens accidentally, such as incidentally to [[cough]]ing or [[sneezing]] or during [[orgasm]]; on other occasions, flatulence can be voluntarily elicited by tensing the rectum or "bearing down" on stomach or bowel muscles and subsequently relaxing the anal sphincter, resulting in the expulsion of flatus.

==Pathology==

===Symptoms related to intestinal gas===

Generally speaking, there are 4 different types of complaint that relate to intestinal gas, which may present individually or in combination.

* '''Bloating, abdominal distension and pain'''
Patients may complain of bloating as abdominal distension, discomfort and pain from "trapped wind". In the past, functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) which produced symptoms of bloating were attributed to increased production of intestinal gas. However, 3 significant pieces of evidence refute this theory. First, in normal subjects, even very high rates of gas infusion into the small intestine (30 ml/min) are tolerated without complaints of pain or bloating and harmlessly passed as flatus per rectum.<ref name="Azpiroz 2005" /> Secondly, studies aiming to quantify the total volume of gas produced by IBS patients (some including gas emitted from the mouth by eructation) have consistently failed to demonstrate increased volumes compared to healthy subjects. The proportion of hydrogen produced by IBS patients may be increased in a subset of IBS patients, but this does not effect the total volume.<ref name="King 1998">{{cite journal|last=King|first=TS|coauthors=Elia, M; Hunter, JO|title=Abnormal colonic fermentation in irritable bowel syndrome.|journal=Lancet|date=1998 Oct 10|volume=352|issue=9135|pages=1187–9|pmid=9777836|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)02146-1}}</ref> Thirdly, it is known that the total volume of flatus produced by IBS patients who complain of pain and abdominal distension would be tolerated in normal subjects without any complaints of pain.
 
Patients who complain of bloating frequently can be shown to objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined with the fact that the total volume flatus is not increased lead to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients, there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension.<ref name="Azpiroz 2005" /> In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.

* '''Excessive flatus volume/production'''
As mentioned above, the normal range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476-1491ml/24h).<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /> All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs whilst eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is a normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and has been shown in a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g. carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gasses make up 74% of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition.<ref name="Azpiroz 2005" /> The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor which dictates the volume of flatus produced.<ref name="Azpiroz 2005" /> Diets which aim to reduce the amount of undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasized that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.

* '''Excessive flatus odor'''
Although flatus possesses physiological odor, this may be abnormally increased in some patients and cause social distress to the patient. Increased odor of flatus presents a distinct clinical issue from other complaints related to intestinal gas.<ref name="Bailey 2009">{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=J|coauthors=Carter, NJ; Neher, JO|title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries: Effective management of flatulence.|journal=American family physician|date=2009 Jun 15|volume=79|issue=12|pages=1098–100|pmid=19530642}}</ref> Some patients may exhibit over-sensitivity to physiological flatus malodor, and in extreme forms, [[olfactory reference syndrome]] may be diagnosed.

* '''Incontinence of flatus'''
"Gas incontinence" could be defined as loss of voluntary control over the passage of flatus. It is a recognized subtype of [[fecal incontinence]], and is usually related to minor disruptions of the continence mechanisms. Some consider gas incontinence to be the first, sometimes only, symptom of fecal incontinence.<ref name="ASCRS textbook">{{cite book|last=al.]|first=senior editors, Bruce G. Wolff ... [et|title=The ASCRS textbook of colon and rectal surgery|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0-387-24846-3}}</ref>

===Etiology===
Intestinal gas is composed of varying quantities of exogenous sources (air that is ingested through the nose and mouth) and endogenous sources (gas produced within the digestive tract).<ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gas/ Gas in the Digestive Tract - National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The exogenous gases are swallowed ([[aerophagia]]) when eating or drinking or increased swallowing during times of excessive salivation (as might occur when nauseated or as the result of [[gastroesophageal reflux]] disease). The [[endogenous]] gases are produced either as a by-product of digesting certain types of food, or of incomplete [[digestion]]. Anything that causes food to be incompletely digested by the [[stomach]] and/or [[small intestine]] may cause flatulence when the material arrives in the large intestine, due to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] by [[yeast]] or [[prokaryotes]] normally or abnormally present in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

Flatulence-producing foods are typically high in certain [[polysaccharide]]s, (especially [[oligosaccharides]] such as [[inulin]]).  Those foods include [[bean]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[dairy product]]s, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[scallion]]s, [[leek]]s, [[turnip]]s, [[rutabagas]], [[radish]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[potatoes]], [[cashew]]s, [[Jerusalem artichoke]]s, [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], and [[yeast]] in [[bread]]s. [[Cauliflower]], [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]], [[Brussels sprouts]] and other [[cruciferous vegetables]] that belong to the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' are commonly reputed to not only increase flatulence, but to increase the pungency of the flatus.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In beans, endogenous gases seem to arise from complex oligosaccharides ([[carbohydrate]]s) that are particularly resistant to digestion by mammals, but which are readily digestible by [[gut flora]] – [[microorganisms]] (methane-producing archaea; ''[[Methanobrevibacter smithii]]'') that inhabit the [[digestive tract]]. These oligosaccharides pass through the upper intestine largely unchanged, and when they reach the lower intestine, [[bacteria]] feed on them, producing copious amounts of flatus.<ref name="McGee">{{cite book| last=McGee| first=Harold| title=[[On Food and Cooking]]| publisher=Scribner| year=1984| isbn=0-684-84328-5| pages=257–8}}</ref>

In the case of people who have [[lactose intolerance]], intestinal bacteria feeding on lactose can give rise to excessive gas production when [[milk]] or lactose-containing substances have been consumed.

Interest in the causes of flatulence was spurred by high-altitude [[flight]] and the [[space program]]; the low [[atmospheric pressure]], confined conditions, and stresses peculiar to those endeavours were cause for concern.<ref name="McGee"/> In the field of mountaineering, the phenomena of [[high altitude flatus expulsion]] was first recorded over two hundred years ago.

Some infections, such as [[giardiasis]], are also associated with flatulence.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2272232 | pmid=1499664 | volume=109 | issue=1 | title=Giardia--diagnosis, clinical course and epidemiology. A review | year=1992 | month=August | author=Flanagan PA | journal=Epidemiol. Infect. | pages=1–22}}</ref>

===Management===

Since problems involving intestinal gas presents as different (but sometimes combined) complaints, the management is cause related.

====Pain, bloating and abdominal distension====
{{main|Abdominal distension}}
{{main|Bloating}}
While not affecting the production of the gases themselves, [[surfactants]] (agents which lower [[surface tension]]) can reduce the disagreeable sensations associated with flatulence, by aiding the dissolution of the gases into liquid and solid fecal matter.
<ref name="brecevic">{{cite journal |author=Brecević L, Bosan-Kilibarda I, Strajnar F |title=Mechanism of antifoaming action of simethicone |journal=J Appl Toxicol |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=207–11 |year=1994 |pmid=8083482 |doi= 10.1002/jat.2550140311|url=}}
</ref> Preparations containing [[simethicone]] reportedly operate by promoting the coalescence of smaller bubbles into larger ones more easily passed from the body, either by [[burp]]ing or flatulence. Such preparations do not decrease the total amount of gas generated in or passed from the colon, but make the bubbles larger and thereby allowing them to be passed more easily.<ref name="brecevic" />

Other drugs including [[prokinetics]], [[lubiprostone]], antibiotics and probiotics are also used to treat bloating in patients with functional bowel disorders such as IBS, and there is some evidence that these measures may reduce symptoms.<ref name="Schmulson 2011">{{cite journal|last=Schmulson|first=M|coauthors=Chang, L|title=Review article: the treatment of functional abdominal bloating and distension.|journal=Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics|date=2011 May|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1071–86|pmid=21488913|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04637.x}}</ref>

====Volume====
{{main|Antiflatulent}}
{{main|Carminative}}
One method of reducing the volume of flatus produced is dietary modification, reducing the amount of fermentable carbohydrates. This is the theory behind diets such as the low [[FODMAP diet]] (low fermentable oligosaccharide, dissacharide, monosaccharide and polyols).<ref name="Staudacher 2011">{{cite journal|last=Staudacher|first=HM|coauthors=Whelan, K; Irving, PM; Lomer, MC|title=Comparison of symptom response following advice for a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) versus standard dietary advice in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.|journal=Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association|date=2011 Oct|volume=24|issue=5|pages=487–95|pmid=21615553|doi=10.1111/j.1365-277X.2011.01162.x}}</ref>  

Certain [[spice]]s have been reported to counteract the production of intestinal gas, most notably the closely related [[cumin]], [[coriander]], [[caraway]] and others such as [[ajwain]], [[turmeric]], [[asafoetida]] (hing), [[epazote]], and [[kombu]] [[kelp]] (a Japanese [[seaweed]]). Most starches, including potatoes, corn, noodles, and wheat, produce gas as they are broken down in the large intestine. Rice is the only starch that does not cause gas.<ref>''[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gas/index.htm Gas in the Digestive Tract]'' a publication of National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, part of the US National Institute of Health</ref> The amount of water-soluble [[oligosaccharide]] in beans that may contribute to production of intestinal gas is reputed to be reduced by a long period of soaking followed by boiling, but at a cost of also leaching out other water-soluble nutrients.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Also, intestinal gas can be reduced by fermenting the beans, and making them less gas-inducing, and/or by cooking them in the liquor from a previous batch. Some [[legume]]s also stand up to prolonged cooking, which can help break down the oligosaccharides into simple sugars. On the other hand, fermented bean products such as [[miso]] are less likely to produce as much intestinal gas.  Fermentative lactic acid bacteria such as ''[[Lactobacillus casei]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' reduce flatulence in human intestinal tract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Study shows secret to gas-free beans|url=http://reuters.myway.com/article/20060426/2006-04-26T170153Z_01_N25328545_RTRIDST_0_ODD-BEANS-DC-DC.html |date=2006-04-26|accessdate=2007-09-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060502110835/http://reuters.myway.com/article/20060426/2006-04-26T170153Z_01_N25328545_RTRIDST_0_ODD-BEANS-DC-DC.html |archivedate = 2006-05-02}}</ref>

[[Probiotic]]s ([[yogurt|live yogurt]], [[kefir]], etc.) are reputed to reduce flatulence when used to restore balance to the normal [[intestinal flora]].<ref>Rubin J. and J. Brasco, ''Restoring Your Digestive Health'' (2003).</ref> Live (bioactive) yogurt contains, among other lactic bacteria, ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'' which may be useful in reducing flatulence. ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus|L. acidophilus]]'' may make the intestinal environmnent more acidic,  supporting a natural balance of the fermentative processes.  ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus|L. acidophilus]]'' is available in supplements (some believe non-dairy is best{{who|date=September 2012}}). [[Prebiotics]], which generally are non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as [[fructooligosaccharide]], generally increase flatulence in a similar way as described for lactose intolerance.

[[Digestive enzyme]] supplements may significantly reduce the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large [[intestines]]. It has been suggested that [[alpha-galactosidase]] [[enzymes]], which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ganiats TG| coauthors=Norcross WA, Halverson AL, Burford PA, Palinkas LA| title=Does Beano prevent gas?

The [[antibiotic]] [[rifaximin]], often used to treat [[diarrhea]] caused by the [[microorganism]] ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', may reduce both the production of intestinal gas and the frequency of flatus events.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Di Stefano M| coauthors=Strocchi A, Malservisi S, Veneto G, Ferrieri A, Corazza GR| title=Non-absorbable antibiotics for managing intestinal gas production and gas-related symptoms| journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther| year=2000| volume=14| pages=1001–8| doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00808.x |pmid=10930893 | issue=8}}</ref>

====Odor====

'''Bismuth'''

[[Odor]] from flatulence is commonly treated with [[bismuth subgallate]], available over-the-counter as Devrom. Bismuth subgallate is commonly used by individuals who have had [[ostomy]] surgery, [[bariatric surgery]], [[fecal incontinence]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Turnbull G| title=The Ostomy Files:The Issue of Oral Medications and a Fecal Ostomy| journal=Ostomy/Wound Management|year=2005| volume=51| pages=14–16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_Colostomy.asp|title=Colostomy Guide|date=2006-01-04|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> Bismuth suvsalicylate is a compound that binds H<sub>2</sub>S, and one study reported a dose of 524&nbsp;mg four times a day for 3–7 days bismuth subsalicylate yielded a >95% reduction in fecal H<sub>2</sub>S release in both humans and rats.<ref name="Suarez 1998">{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=FL|coauthors=Furne, JK; Springfield, J; Levitt, MD|title=Bismuth subsalicylate markedly decreases hydrogen sulfide release in the human colon.|journal=Gastroenterology|date=1998 May|volume=114|issue=5|pages=923–9|pmid=9558280}}</ref> Another bismuth compound, bismuth subnitrate was also shown to bind with H<sub>2</sub>S.<ref name="Levitt 2002">{{cite journal|last=Levitt|first=MD|coauthors=Springfield, J; Furne, J; Koenig, T; Suarez, FL|title=Physiology of sulfide in the rat colon: use of bismuth to assess colonic sulfide production.|journal=Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)|date=2002 Apr|volume=92|issue=4|pages=1655–60|pmid=11896034|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00907.2001}}</ref> Another study showed that bismuth acted synergistically with various antibiotics to inhibit sulfate-reducing gut bacteria and sulfide production.<ref name="Ohge 2003">{{cite journal|last=Ohge|first=H|coauthors=Furne, JK; Springfield, J; Sueda, T; Madoff, RD; Levitt, MD|title=The effect of antibiotics and bismuth on fecal hydrogen sulfide and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the rat.|journal=FEMS microbiology letters|date=2003 Nov 7|volume=228|issue=1|pages=137–42|pmid=14612249}}</ref>  Some authors proposed a theory that H<sub>2</sub>S was involved in the development of ulcerative colitis and that bismuth might be helpful in the management of this condition.<ref name="Furne 2000">{{cite journal|last=Furne|first=JK|coauthors=Suarez, FL; Ewing, SL; Springfield, J; Levitt, MD|title=Binding of hydrogen sulfide by bismuth does not prevent dextran sulfate-induced colitis in rats.|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=2000 Jul|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1439–43|pmid=10961726}}</ref> However, bismuth administration in rats did not prevent them from developing ulcerative colitis despite reduced H<sub>2</sub>S production.<ref name="Furne 2000" /> Also, new evidence suggests that colonic H<sub>2</sub>S is largely present in bound forms, probably sulfides of iron and other metals.<ref name="Tangerman 2009" /> Rarely, serious bismuth toxicity may occur with higher doses.<ref name="Gordon 1995">{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=MF|coauthors=Abrams, RI; Rubin, DB; Barr, WB; Correa, DD|title=Bismuth subsalicylate toxicity as a cause of prolonged encephalopathy with myoclonus.|journal=Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society|date=1995 Mar|volume=10|issue=2|pages=220–2|pmid=7753066|doi=10.1002/mds.870100215}}</ref>

''' Activated charcoal'''

Despite being an ancient treatment for various digestive complaints, activated charcoal did not produce reduction in both the total flatus volume nor the release of sulfur containing gasses, and there was no reduction in abdominal symptoms (after 0.52g activated charcoal four times a day for 1 week).<ref name="Suarez 1999">{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=FL|coauthors=Furne, J; Springfield, J; Levitt, MD|title=Failure of activated charcoal to reduce the release of gases produced by the colonic flora.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=1999 Jan|volume=94|issue=1|pages=208–12|pmid=9934757|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.00798.x}}</ref> The authors suggested that saturation of charcoal binding sites during its passage through he gut was the reason for this. A further study concluded that activated charcoal (4g) does not influence gas formation in vitro or in vivo.<ref name="Potter 1985">{{cite journal|last=Potter|first=T|coauthors=Ellis, C; Levitt, M|title=Activated charcoal: in vivo and in vitro studies of effect on gas formation.|journal=Gastroenterology|date=1985 Mar|volume=88|issue=3|pages=620–4|pmid=3917957}}</ref> Other authors reported that activated charcoal was effective. A study in 8 dogs concluded activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) reduced H<sub>2</sub>S by 71%. In combination with yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate, this was increased to an 86% H<sub>2</sub>S reduction, although total flatus volume and number of flatus events was unchanged.<ref name="Giffard 2001">{{cite journal|last=Giffard|first=CJ|coauthors=Collins, SB; Stoodley, NC; Butterwick, RF; Batt, RM|title=Administration of charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate to reduce malodorous flatulence in dogs.|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=2001 Mar 15|volume=218|issue=6|pages=892–6|pmid=11294313}}</ref> An early study reported activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) prevented a large increase in the number of flatus events and increased breath hydrogen concentrations that normally occur following a gas-producing meal.<ref name="Hall 1981">{{cite journal|last=Hall RG|first=Jr|coauthors=Thompson, H; Strother, A|title=Effects of orally administered activated charcoal on intestinal gas.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=1981 Mar|volume=75|issue=3|pages=192–6|pmid=7015846}}</ref> 

'''Garments & external devices'''

In 1998, Chester "Buck" Weimer of [[Pueblo, Colorado]] received a patent for the first [[undergarment]] that contained a replaceable [[Activated carbon|charcoal filter]]. The undergarments are [[Hermetic seal|air-tight]] and provide a pocketed [[path of least resistance|escape hole]] in which a charcoal filter can be inserted.<ref name="weimer">{{cite web |last=Weimer |first=Chester |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?TERM1=5593398&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=0&l=50&f=S&d=PALL|title= Protective underwear with malodorous flatus filter|date=1997-01-14|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> In 2001 Mr Weimer received the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Biology for his invention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2001|title=The 2001 Ig Nobel Prize Winners|accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref>

A similar product was released in 2002, but rather than an entire undergarment, consumers are able to purchase an insert similar to a [[pantiliner]] that contains activated charcoal.<ref>{{cite web |last= Conant |first= Brian J. |coauthors= Myra M.

====Incontinence====
{{main|Fecal incontinence}}
"Flatus incontinence" where there is involuntary passage of flatus, is a type of [[fecal incontinence]], and is managed similarly.

==Societal & Cultural aspects==
In many [[culture]]s, human flatulence in public is regarded as embarrassing, but, depending on context, can also be considered humorous.  People will often strain to hold in the passing of gas when in polite company, or position themselves to conceal the noise and scent.  In other cultures{{Examples|date=January 2011}}, it may be no more embarrassing than [[cough]]ing.

While the act of passing flatus in said cultures is generally considered to be an unfortunate occurrence in public settings, flatulence may, in casual circumstances and especially among children, be used as either a humorous supplement to a joke ("[[pull my finger]]"), or as a comic activity in and of itself.  The social acceptability of flatulence-based humor in entertainment and the mass media varies over the course of time and between cultures.  The humorous insult "I fart in your general direction" from the comedy film [[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] has been reprinted on several posters, t-shirts, and hats.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The [[Whoopee cushion]] is a joking device invented in the early 20th century for simulating a fart. In 2008, a farting application for the [[iPhone]] raked in nearly $10,000 in one day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/12/iphone-fart-app/|title=iPhone Fart App Rakes in $10,000 a Day|last=Chen|first=Brian X.|date=December 24, 2008|work=[[Wired News]]}}</ref>

A farting game named ''Touch Wood'' was documented by [[John Gregory Bourke]] in the 1890s.<ref name="pennlive essay on farting">{{cite web | url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/06/penn_state_professors_essay_on.html | title=Penn State professor's essay on farting takes the prize | publisher=pennlive | date=June 8, 2011 | accessdate=December 28, 2011 | author=Fishlock, Diana | quote=Trevor Blank [...] found Pennsylvania boys playing “Safety,” a farting game, the same as Blank had as a kid in Maryland, and the same game John Bourke documented in the 1890s, when it was called “Touch Wood.” Basically, a boy who farts must say “Safety” or touch wood before his friends say another key phrase. If not, they’re allowed to punch him. (It usually is boys who make farting a game or a weapon.)}}</ref> It existed under the name of ''Safety'' in the 20th century in the US, and has been found being played in 2011.<ref name="pennlive essay on farting" />

In January 2011, the [[Malawi]] Minister of Justice, [[George Chaponda]], said that [[2011 Malawian Air Fouling Legislation|Air Fouling Legislation]] would make public farting illegal in his country. The media had a field day with punning headlines when they reported the story. Later, the minister withdrew his statement.<ref name=MaraviPost>{{cite web

==Environmental impact==
[[Image:Cow female black white.jpg|thumb|200px|The flatulence of [[cattle|cows]] is only a small portion of cows' methane release. Cows also ''[[belching|burp]]'' methane, due to the physiology of their digestive systems.]]

Flatulence is often blamed as a significant source of [[greenhouse gas]]es, owing to the erroneous belief that the methane released by [[livestock]] is in the flatus.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/southqld/stories/s1560903.htm?backyard ABC Southern Queensland: "Could skippy stop cows farting and end global warming?"] Friday, 3 February  2006. Example of error. Although the article doesn't specify whether the methane is released by flatulence or eructation, it appears the headline-writer assumes it's through flatulence.</ref> While livestock account for around 20% of global [[methane]] emissions,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431| title=Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas| first=Rachel| last=Nowak| date=September 24, 2004| work=New Scientist}}</ref> 90–95% of that is released by [[breath|exhaling]] or [[burping]].<ref>[http://www.mycattle.com/health/dsp_health_article.cfm?storyid=10045 "Bovine belching called udderly serious gas problem—Global warming concerns spur effort to cut methane."] By Gary Polakovic. ''Los Angeles Times'', Sunday, July 13, 2003.</ref> 

Since [[New Zealand]] produces large amounts of agricultural product, it is in the unique position of having high methane emissions from livestock compared to other greenhouse gas sources.  The New Zealand government is a signatory to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and therefore attempts are being made to reduce greenhouse emissions. To achieve this, an [[agricultural emissions research levy]] was proposed, which promptly became known as a "[[Agricultural emissions research levy|fart tax]]" or "flatulence tax".  It encountered opposition from farmers, farming lobby groups and opposition politicians.

In [[Fresno, California]], a system to harvest methane by-product from dairy cattle and convert it to usable bio-gas is being used, in a partnership with [[Pacific Gas & Electric]] (PG&E) and BioEnergy Solutions, in which BioEnergy Solutions sells the methane harvested from cows to PG&E, who then converts the methane to usable bio-gas, which is very similar to natural gas. (It should be recognized, however, that this has nothing to do with flatulence. The gas in question is produced by anaerobic fermentation of cattle waste in an enclosed lagoon.)<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3334856/California-converting-cow-dung-into-biogas.html "California converting cow dung into biogas."] By Catherine Elsworth. ''Telegraph Media Group Limited'', March 5, 2008.</ref>

==Farting at will==
{{Main|Flatulist}}

Historical comment on the ability to fart at will is observed as early as [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' (5th century AD). Augustine mentions men who "have such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing". The fact that mankind in general has lost this ability he attributes to the first sin of [[Adam and Eve]] and its consequences with respect to body control.<ref>''The City of God Against the Pagans'', ed and trans Philip Levine, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1966, XIV.24.</ref> Intentional passing of gas and its use as entertainment for others appear to have been somewhat well known in pre-modern Europe, according to mentions of it in medieval and later literature, including Rabelais.

[[Le Pétomane]] ("the Fartomaniac") was a famous French performer in the 19th century who, as well as many [[Flatulist|professional farter]]s before him, did flatulence impressions and held shows. The performer [[Mr. Methane]] carries on le Pétomane's tradition today. Also, a 2002 film ''[[Thunderpants]]'' revolves around a boy named Patrick Smash who has an ongoing flatulence problem since he was a newborn baby. He eventually overcame his problems and fulfilled his dreams including being an [[astronaut]].
