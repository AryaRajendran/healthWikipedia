'''Elixir sulfanilamide''' was an improperly prepared [[sulfanilamide]] medicine that caused mass [[poison]]ing in the United States in 1937.  It caused the deaths of more than 100 people. The public outcry caused by this incident and other similar disasters  led to the passing of the 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].<ref name=FDA>[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm The 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Medicine: Post-Mortem |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758704,00.html |quote=Then, two months ago, fatality knocked at its door.

== History ==
Aside from the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906 and the [[Harrison Act]] of 1914 banning the sale of some narcotic drugs, there was no federal regulatory control ensuring the safety of new drugs until Congress enacted the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in response to the elixir sulfanilamide poisoning crisis.

In 1937, [[S. E. Massengill Company]], a pharmaceutical manufacturer, created a preparation of [[sulfanilamide]] using [[diethylene glycol]] (DEG) as a [[solvent]], and called the preparation "Elixir Sulfanilamide".<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wallace Reveals How Federal Agents Traced Elixir to Halt Fatalities |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C15F93B59177A93C4AB178AD95F438385F9 |quote=A graphic story of a race against death from "elixir sulfanilamide," carried on by the Food and Drug Administration in fifteen States from Virginia to California, a race not won until ninety-three persons had died after taking the lethal dose, was told by Secretary Wallace today in a report responding to Senate and House resolutions. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 26, 1937 |accessdate=2009-07-20 }}</ref> DEG is poisonous to humans, but Harold Watkins, the company's chief pharmacist and chemist, was not aware of this. (Though the first case of a fatality from ethylene glycol occurred in 1930 and studies had been published in medical journals stating DEG could cause kidney damage or failure, its toxicity was not widely known prior to the incident.)<ref name=FDA/><ref name="The clinical toxicology laboratory">{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Leslie M.|title=The clinical toxicology laboratory : contemporary practice of poisoning evaluation|year=2001|publisher=AACC Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1890883530|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pXvFGqz44pYC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=ethylene+glycol+toxicity+1930&source=bl&ots=T0wT4wUAmp&sig=KwlnK_oWMJuwtUjMB05KM5lcrvc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4GqQULL4BsHaqgHN7YG4BQ&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ethylene%20glycol%20toxicity%201930&f=false}}</ref>  Watkins simply added raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug which he had dissolved in DEG and the company then marketed the product. Although [[animal testing]] should have been routine in most drug company operations, Massengill performed none and there were no regulations requiring premarket safety testing of new drugs.

The company started selling and distributing the medication in September 1937. By October 11, the [[American Medical Association]] received a report of several deaths caused by the medication. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] was notified, and an extensive search was conducted to recover the distributed medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel|title=Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-14180-0}}</ref>  [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] assisted on a research project that verified that the [[excipient]] DEG was responsible for the fatal [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]s. At least 100 deaths were blamed on the medication.

The owner of the company, when pressed to admit some measure of culpability, infamously answered, "We have been supplying a legitimate professional demand and not once could have foreseen the unlooked-for results. I do not feel that there was any responsibility on our part."<ref name=mihm>{{cite web

A woman wrote to U.S. President Roosevelt and described the death of her daughter:
"The first time I ever had occasion to call in a doctor for [Joan] and she was given Elixir of Sulfanilamide. All that is left to us is the caring for her little grave. Even the memory of her is mixed with sorrow for we can see her little body tossing to and fro and hear that little voice screaming with pain and it seems as though it would drive me insane. ... It is my plea that you will take steps to prevent such sales of drugs that will take little lives and leave such suffering behind and such a bleak outlook on the future as I have tonight."

Congress responded to public outrage by passing the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which required companies to perform animal safety tests on their proposed new drugs and submit the data to the FDA before being allowed to market their products.  The Massengill Company paid a minimum fine under provisions of the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, which prohibited labeling the preparation an "[[elixir]]" if it had no alcohol in it.
