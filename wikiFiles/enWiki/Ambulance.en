An '''ambulance''' is a [[vehicle]] for transportation of sick or injured people to, from or between places of treatment for an [[illness]] or [[injury]],<ref>[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, "The Origin of Medical Terms". Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins</ref> and in some instances will also provide out of hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road going ''emergency ambulances'' which form part of an [[emergency medical service]], administering [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] to those with acute medical problems.

The term ''ambulance'' does, however, extend to a wider range of vehicles other than those with flashing [[emergency vehicle lighting|warning lights]] and [[siren (noisemaker)|sirens]].  The term also includes a large number of non-urgent ambulances which are for transport of patients without an urgent acute condition (see [[#Functional types|functional types]], below) and a wide range of urgent and non-urgent vehicles including trucks, vans, bicycles, [[Motorcycle ambulance|motorbikes]], station wagons, buses, [[helicopter]]s, [[fixed-wing aircraft]], boats, and even [[hospital ship]]s (see [[#Vehicle types|vehicle types]], also below).

The term ''ambulance'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''ambulare'', meaning to walk or move about<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/ambulance|title=How Products Are Made: Ambulance|publisher=How products are made|accessdate=2 June 2007}}</ref> which is a reference to early medical care where patients were moved by lifting or wheeling. The word originally meant a moving hospital, which follows an army in its movements.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' ambulance definition 1</ref> During the [[American Civil War]] vehicles for conveying the wounded off the field of battle were called ambulance wagons.<ref>[http://www.civilwarhome.com/ambulancewagons.htm Civil War Ambulance Wagons]</ref> [[Field hospital]]s were still called ambulances during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]<ref>The memoirs of Charles E. Ryan ''With An Ambulance Personal Experiences And Adventures With Both Armies 1870–1871'' [http://www.ourstory.info/library/1-roots/Ryan/ambTC.html#TC] and of [[Emma Maria Pearson]] and [[Louisa McLaughlin]] ''Our Adventures During the War of 1870'' [http://www.ukchnm.org/uploads/file/ouradventures.pdf]</ref> of 1870 and in the Serbo-Turkish war of 1876<ref>[[Emma Maria Pearson]] and [[Louisa McLaughlin]] ''Service in Servia Under the Red Cross'' [http://www.ukchnm.org/uploads/file/serviceinservia.pdf]</ref> even though the wagons were first referred to as ambulances about 1854 during the [[Crimean War]].<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' ambulance definition 2a</ref>

There are other types of ambulance, with the most common being the ''patient transport ambulance'' (sometimes called an [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ambulette ambulette]). These vehicles are not usually (although there are exceptions) equipped with life-support equipment, and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances.  Their purpose is simply to transport patients to, from or between places of treatment. In most countries, these are not equipped with flashing lights or sirens. In some jurisdictions there is a modified form of the ambulance used, that only carries one member of ambulance crew to the scene to provide care, but is not used to transport the patient.<ref name=essexcar>{{cite web|url=http://www.carpages.co.uk/honda/honda_essex_ambulance_chooses_honda_power_24_07_04.asp|title=Essex Ambulance Response Cars|publisher=Car Pages|date=24 July 2004|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref> Such vehicles are called [[fly-car]]s. In these cases a patient who requires transportation to hospital will require a patient-carrying ambulance to attend in addition to the fast responder.

{{Main|History of the ambulance}}

The history of the ambulance begins in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], with the use of [[cart]]s to transport incurable patients by force. Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish, and civilian variants were put into operation during the 1830s.<ref name=Ambulance>{{cite book | author=Katherine T. Barkley | year=1990 | title=The Ambulance | publisher=Exposition Press}}</ref> Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered ambulances.

==Functional types==
Ambulances can be grouped into types depending on whether or not they transport patients, and under what conditions. In some cases, ambulances may fulfil more than one function (such as combining emergency ambulance care with patient transport).
*'''Emergency ambulance''' – The most common type of ambulance, which provide care to patients with an acute illness or injury.  These can be road-going vans, boats, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft (known as [[air ambulance]]s) or even converted vehicles such as [[golf cart]]s.
*'''Patient transport ambulance''' – A vehicle, which has the job of transporting patients to, from or between places of medical treatment, such as hospital or [[dialysis]] center, for non-urgent care. These can be vans, buses or other vehicles.
*'''Response unit''' – Also known as a '''[[fly-car]]''' or a '''[Quick Response Vehicle]''', which is a vehicle which is used to reach an acutely ill patient quickly, and provide on scene care, but lacks the capacity to transport the patient from the scene. Response units may be backed up by an emergency ambulance which can transport the patient, or may deal with the problem on scene, with no requirement for a transport ambulance. These can be a wide variety of vehicles, from standard cars, to modified vans, motorcycles, [[Bicycle|pedal cycles]], [[quad bike]]s or horses. These units can function as a vehicle for officers or supervisors (similar to a [[fire chief's vehicle]], but for ambulance services).
*'''Charity ambulance''' – A special type of patient transport ambulance is provided by a charity for the purpose of taking sick children or adults on trips or vacations away from hospitals, hospices or care homes where they are in long term care. Examples include the United Kingdom's 'Jumbulance' project.<ref name=jumbulance>{{cite web|url=http://www.jumbulance.org.uk/faq.html|title=Questions and Answers|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Jumbulance Travel Trust| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070702165512/http://www.jumbulance.org.uk/faq.html| archivedate= 2 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> These are usually based on a bus.
*'''[[Bariatric ambulance]]''' – A special type of patient transport ambulance designed for extremely obese patients equipped with the appropriate tools to move and manage these patients.

==Vehicle types==
Ambulances can be based on many types of vehicle, although emergency and [[disaster]] conditions may lead to other vehicles serving as makeshift ambulances:

*'''Van''' or '''[[pickup truck]]''' – A typical ambulance is based on either the chassis of a van (vanbulance) or pickup truck. This chassis is then modified to the designs and specifications of the purchaser.
*'''Car'''/'''[[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]''' – Used either as a [[fly-car]] for rapid response<ref name=essexcar/> or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted to the requirements of the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a [[stretcher]] with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) [[hearse]]s, as these were some of the few vehicles able to accept a human body in a [[supine position]].

[[File:English ambulance.JPG|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz Sprinter ambulance typically used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland]]
*'''Motorcycle''' – In developed areas, these are used for rapid response in an emergency<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcentralambulance.nhs.uk/dynamicpage.php?pagerec=60|title=South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust – About Us|accessdate=18 October 2009|publisher=South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust}}</ref> as they can travel through heavy traffic much faster than a car or van. [[Trailer (vehicle)|Trailer]]s or [[sidecar]]s can make these patient transporting units.<ref name=motor1>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnn.co.uk/WorldwideNews/plonearticle.2006-07-04.2967165399|title=News Reference to Motorcycle Trailer Ambulance|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=TNN}}</ref><ref name=motor2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ittransport.co.uk/documents/Bicycleambulance.pdf|title=Motorcycle Trailer-Ambulance Brochure|publisher=IT Transport LTD|accessdate=2 June 2007|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070614021104/http://www.ittransport.co.uk/documents/Bicycleambulance.pdf| archivedate= 14 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  See also [[motorcycle ambulance]].
*'''Bicycle''' – Used for response, but usually in pedestrian-only areas where large vehicles find access difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/news/news_releases_and_statements/two-wheeled_medics_cover_more.aspx|title=Two-wheeled medics cover more ground in the capital|accessdate=18 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/news/news_releases_and_statements/square_mile_cycle-paramedics_b.aspx|title=Square-Mile cycle paramedics become the new City-Slickers|accessdate=18 October 2009}}</ref> Like the motorcycle ambulance, a bicycle may be connected to a trailer for patient transport, most often in the developing world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designfordevelopment.org/activities/bike_ambulance.html|title=Bike Ambulance Project|publisher=Design for Development|date=20 July 2005|accessdate=14 July 2007}}</ref>  See also [[cycle responder]].
*'''[[All-terrain vehicle]]''' (ATV) – for example quad bikes; these are used for response off road,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quadtech.co.uk/index.php?section_id=100|title=Information on Quadtech EMS quad|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Quadtech}}</ref> especially at events. ATVs can be modified to carry a stretcher, and are used for tasks such as [[mountain rescue]] in inaccessible areas.
*'''[[Golf cart]]''' or '''[[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]''' – Used for rapid response at events<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diversifiedgolfcars.com/standardambulance.htm|title=EMS golf cart brochure|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Diversified Golf Cars |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070405122944/http://www.diversifiedgolfcars.com/standardambulance.htm |archivedate = 5 April 2007}}</ref> or on campuses.  These function similarly to ATVs, with less rough terrain capability, but with less noise.
*'''[[Helicopter]]''' – Usually used for emergency care, either in places inaccessible by road, or in areas where speed is of the essence, as they are able to travel significantly faster than a road ambulance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/15658.aspx|title=Highways Agency – Air Ambulance|accessdate=18 October 2009}}</ref>  Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at [[air ambulance]].
*'''[[Fixed-wing aircraft]]''' – These can be used for either acute emergency care in remote areas (such as in Australia, with the '[[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|Flying Doctors]]'<ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|title=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070612073357/http://www.flyingdoctor.net/| archivedate= 12 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairambulance.com/repatriation.html|title=Heathrow Air Ambulance Service|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Heathrow air ambulance| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070617031304/http://heathrowairambulance.com/repatriation.html| archivedate= 17 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>), or transportation between distant hospitals.  Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at [[air ambulance]].
*'''Boat''' – Boats can be used to serve as ambulances, especially in island areas<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/3181602.stm|title=Islanders to get Ambulance Boat|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2009 | date=10 October 2003}}</ref> or in areas with a large number of canals, such as the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[water ambulance]]s. Some [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s or [[lifeguard]] vessels may fit the description of an ambulance as they are used to transport a casualty.
*'''Ship''' – Ships can be used as [[hospital ship]]s, mostly operated by national military services,<ref name=ship1>{{cite web|title=US Navy Military Sealift Command – Hospital Ships|url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/inventory.asp?var=Hospitalship|accessdate=17 June 2007|publisher=US Navy Military Sealift Command| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629172753/http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/inventory.asp?var=Hospitalship| archivedate= 29 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> although some ships are operated by charities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercyships.org.uk/mission-vision|title=Mission and Vision|publisher=Mercy Ships|accessdate=18 October 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091002013751/http://www.mercyships.org.uk/mission-vision| archivedate= 2 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> They can meet the definition of ambulances as they provide transport to the sick and wounded (along with treatment). They are often [[Disaster response|sent to disaster]] or war zones to provide care for the casualties of these events.
*'''Bus''' – In some cases, buses can be used for multiple casualty transport, either for the purposes of taking patients on journeys,<ref name=jumbulance/> in the context of [[Disaster response|major incidents]], or to deal with specific problems such as drunken patients in town centres.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=London Ambulance Service|title=Ambulance crews prepare for party night pressure|url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/news/news_releases_and_statements/ambulance_crews_prepare_for_p.aspx|date=18 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Aboard the 'Booze Bus'|publisher=BBC News|date=17 December 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7147646.stm | accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>  [[Ambulance bus]]ses are discussed at greater length in [[Ambulance bus|their own article]].
*'''Trailer''' – In some instances a trailer, which can be towed behind a self-propelled vehicle can be used. This permits flexibility in areas with minimal access to vehicles, such as on small islands.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Isle of Sark Government|title=General Information – Medical Services|url=http://www.sark.info/index.cfm?fuseaction=gov.content&cmid=552}}</ref>
*'''Horse and cart''' – Especially in developing world areas, more traditional methods of transport include transport such as horse and cart, used in much the same way as motorcycle or bicycle stretcher units to transport to a local clinic.
*'''[[Hospital train]]''' – Early hospital trains functioned to carry large numbers of wounded soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=GreatWarDifferent.com; journal entry  – originally appeared in "The War Illustrated"|title=On the Great White Hospital Train|url=http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Hospital_Train/Hospital_Train_01.htm|accessdate=20111-07-19}}</ref>  Similar to other ambulance types, as Western medicine developed, hospital trains gained the ability to provide treatment.  In some rural locations, hospital trains now function as mobile hospitals, traveling by rail from one location to the next, then parking on a siding to provide hospital services to the local population.<ref name="TSMH">{{cite news|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 February 2009|title=Passage through India is a lifeline to rural poor|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/passage-through-india-is-a-lifeline-to-rural-poor-20090220-8dmb.html|accessdate=20111-07-19}}</ref>  Hospital trains also find use in [[disaster response]]<ref name="TSMH"/>

==Design and construction==
Ambulance design must take into account local conditions and infrastructure. Maintained roads are necessary for road going ambulances to arrive on scene and then transport the patient to a hospital, though in rugged areas [[four-wheel drive]] or all-terrain vehicles can be used. [[Fuel]] must be available and service facilities are necessary to [[Auto mechanic|maintain the vehicle]].

Methods of summoning (e.g. telephone) and [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatching]] ambulances usually rely on [[Electronics|electronic]] equipment, which itself often relies on an intact [[power grid]]. Similarly, modern ambulances are equipped with [[two-way radio]]s<ref>{{cite web|url="http://www.zetron.com/data/site/templates/ZetronTemplate.asp? resolutionfile=templatespath|ZetronTemplate.asp&area_0=pages/Menus/NewsNewsletter&area_1=pages/News/Newsletter/2002/0801-7315"|title=Hospitals H.E.A.R the Call for Emergency Communications|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=radio1>{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencyambulance.com/news-handheldradios.html|title=Handheld radios for Emergency Ambulance Service|date=16 January 2003|accessdate=28 June 2007|publisher=Emergency Ambulance.com}}</ref> or [[Mobile phone|cellular telephones]] to enable them to contact hospitals, either to notify the appropriate hospital of the ambulance's pending arrival, or, in cases where physicians do not form part of the ambulance's crew, to confer with a physician for medical oversight.<ref name=radio2>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9904/07/lifelink.idg/index.html|title=New technology closes gap between accident victims and ER|publisher=CNN News|date=7 April 1999|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref>

Ambulances often have two manufacturers. The first is frequently a manufacturer of light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Nissan]], [[Toyota]], or [[Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demers-ambulances.com/index.php?productId=50&sectionId=95|title=Mystere – Chassis|publisher=Demers Ambulances|accessdate=18 October 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The second manufacturer (known as [[second stage manufacturer]]) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased [[Cutaway van chassis|incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat]]) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, [[emergency vehicle equipment]], and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either [[coachbuilding]], where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty [[chassis]] of the ambulance, and then finished off.

Modern ambulances are typically powered by [[internal combustion engine]]s, which can be powered by any conventional fuel, including [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], gasoline or [[liquefied petroleum gas]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Royal Air Force Motor Sports Association utilizes an LPG-powered ambulance|url=http://www.rafmsa.raf.mod.uk/rafmsa-text/rescue/rescue-front.htm |date=24 November 2005|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=RAFMSA| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070701142554/http://www.rafmsa.raf.mod.uk/rafmsa-text/rescue/rescue-front.htm| archivedate= 1 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The United States Air Force lists an LPG-powered ambulance on a 2001 vehicle roster|url=https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/Library/AFV/Reports/af_afv_report01.doc|date=13 November 2001|accessdate=2 June 2007|format=DOC| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070614021105/https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/Library/AFV/Reports/af_afv_report01.doc| archivedate= 14 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> depending on the preference of the operator and the availability of different options. Colder regions often use gasoline powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold.  Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] in comparison to diesel fuel.<ref>{{cite web|title=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], see campaign ID #s 87V111000 & 87V113000|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=NHTSA| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070530213217/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/| archivedate= 30 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ford Ambulance/Van Fuel-Fed Fires|url=http://www.autosafety.org/ford-ambulancevan-fuel-fed-fires|accessdate=2010, 13 Feb|publisher=Center for Auto Safety}}</ref> The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, [[Ford]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/specialty_vehicles/Ambulance_DisplayContent-Specs.asp?VehicleID=3 |title=2006 Ford E-Series Cutaway Chassis: Specifications|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Ford}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/specialty_vehicles/Ambulance_DisplayContent-Specs.asp?VehicleID=1|title=2006 Ford F-Series Super Duty Chassis Cab Ambulance: Specifications|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Ford}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/specialty_vehicles/Ambulance_DisplayContent-Specs.asp?VehicleID=2|title=2006 Ford E-Series Van Ambulance: Specifications|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Ford}}</ref> would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel powered.

===Safety===
Ambulances, like other [[emergency vehicles]], are required to operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect to stay off the road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as [[seat belt]]s. Research has shown that ambulances are more likely to be involved in [[Car accident|motor vehicle collisions]] resulting in injury or death than either [[fire truck]]s or [[police car]]s. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable.<ref name="pmid12971929">{{cite journal |author=Becker LR, Zaloshnja E, Levick N, Li G, Miller TR |title=Relative risk of injury and death in ambulances and other emergency vehicles |journal=Accid Anal Prev |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=941–8 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=12971929 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001457502001021 |doi=10.1016/S0001-4575(02)00102-1}}</ref> When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries.<ref name="pmid16263674">{{cite journal |author=Ray AF, Kupas DF |title=Comparison of crashes involving ambulances with those of similar-sized vehicles |journal=Prehosp Emerg Care |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=412–5 |year=2005 |month=October – December |pmid=16263674 |doi=10.1080/10903120500253813}}</ref> An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather.<ref name="pmid11446540">{{cite journal |author=Kahn CA, Pirrallo RG, Kuhn EM |title=Characteristics of fatal ambulance crashes in the United States: an 11-year retrospective analysis |journal=Prehosp Emerg Care |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=261–9 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11446540|doi=10.1080/10903120190939751}}</ref> Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics have died during ambulance trips in the US since 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/7262 |title=New Ambulance Design Protects Paramedics|accessdate=17 October 2009|publisher=WESH News}}</ref>

In addition to the equipment directly used for the treatment of patients, ambulances may be fitted with a range of additional equipment which is used in order to facilitate patient care. This could include:
*'''Two-way radio''' – One of the most important pieces of equipment in modern emergency medical services as it allows for the issuing of jobs to the ambulance, and can allow the crew to pass information back to control or to the hospital (for example a priority [[ASHICE]] message to alert the hospital of the impending arrival of a critical patient.)<ref name=radio1/><ref name=radio2/>  More recently many services world wide have moved from traditional analog [[UHF]]/[[VHF]] sets, which can be monitored externally, to more secure digital systems, such as those working on a [[GSM]] system, such as [[TETRA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Business/_Documents/Case%20studies/_Static%20files/case%20study%20ireland%20nationwide.pdf?localeId=252|title=Motorola and Tetra Ireland Consortium Deliver National Public Safety Network|publisher=Motorola|accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref>
*'''[[Mobile data terminal]]''' – Some ambulances are fitted with [[Mobile data terminal]]s (or MDTs), which are connected wirelessly to a central computer, usually at the control center. These terminals can function instead of or alongside the two-way radio and can be used to pass details of jobs to the crew, and can log the time the crew was mobile to a patient, arrived, and left scene, or fulfill any other computer based function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microbus.com/Mobile_Data/Market/Public_Safety.aspx|title=MDT Market Sectors|publisher=Microbus|accessdate=13 June 2007}}</ref>
*'''Evidence gathering [[CCTV]]''' – Some ambulances are now being fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the vehicle. They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities. This can be used as a form of protection from violence against ambulance crews,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3925661.stm|title=CCTV to protect ambulance staff|date=26 July 2004|accessdate=13 June 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> or in some cases (dependent on local laws) to prove or disprove cases where a member of crew stands accused of [[malpractice]].
*'''[[Tail lift]] or ramp''' – Ambulances can be fitted with a tail lift or ramp in order to facilitate loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where the patient is [[obese]] or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a [[neonatal incubator]] or [[hospital bed]]s. There may also be equipment linked to this such as [[winch]]es which are designed to pull heavy patients in to the vehicle.<ref name=tail>{{cite web|url=http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|title=Ambulance Lifts|publisher=Ross and Bonnyman|accessdate=27 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070701055836/http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
*'''Trauma lighting''' – In addition to normal working lighting, ambulances can be fitted with special lighting (often blue or red) which is used when the patient becomes [[photosensitivity|photosensitive]].
*'''[[Air conditioning]]''' – Ambulances are often fitted with a separate air conditioning system to serve the working area from that which serves the cab. This helps to maintain an appropriate temperature for any patients being treated, but may also feature additional features such as [[filter (air)|filter]]ing against airborne pathogens.
*'''Data Recorders''' – These are often placed in ambulances to record such information as speed, braking power and time, activation of active emergency warnings such as lights and sirens, as well as seat belt usage. These are often used in coordination with [[GPS]] units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotiontechnology.com/newsevents/roadsafety.html|title=Press Releases}}</ref>

===Intermediate technology===
In parts of the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, ambulances are designed to meet local conditions, being built using [[intermediate technology]]. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with [[sidecars]] (or [[motorcycle ambulance]]s) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.<ref name=motor1/>

The design of intermediate technology ambulances must take into account not only the operation and maintenance of the ambulance, but its construction as well. The robustness of the design becomes more important, as does the nature of the skills required to properly operate the vehicle. Cost-effectiveness can be a high priority.<ref name=motor2/><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Motorcycle ambulances for referral of obstetric emergencies in rural Malawi: Do they reduce delay and what do they cost? |first1=Jan J. |last1=Hofman |first2=Chris |last2= Dzimadzi |first3= Kingsley |last3= Lungu | first4=Esther Y. |last4=Ratsma |first5= Julia |last5=Hussein  |year= 2008 |journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=191–197 |publisher= International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics |doi= 10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.04.001|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0020-7292/PIIS0020729208001550.pdf |format=PDF |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Appearance and markings==
Emergency ambulances are highly likely to be involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a [[Car accident|road traffic collision]], as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, they may be able to treat a red [[traffic light]] or stop sign as a [[yield sign]] ('give way'),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h08_e.htm#BK213|title=Ontario Highway Traffic Act|year=2009|pages=Section 144.20|accessdate=19 November 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091122043253/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h08_e.htm| archivedate= 22 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> or be permitted to break the speed limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h08_e.htm#BK193|title=Ontario Highway Traffic Act|publisher=Province of Ontario|pages=Section 128.0.13|accessdate=19 November 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091122043253/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h08_e.htm| archivedate= 22 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by [[triage]]) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caep.ca/template.asp?id=98758372CC0F45FB826FFF49812638DD#4%29%20TRIAGE%20&%20ACUITY%20SCALE%20CATEGORY%20DEFINITIONS|title=CTAS Category Definitions|work=Implementation Guidelines for the Canadian ED Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS)|publisher=Canadian Association of Emergency Physician|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.

===Passive visual warnings===
[[File:Reverse ambulance with Star of Life.jpg|thumb|A [[North West Ambulance Service]] ambulance displays reversed wording and the [[Star of Life]], with flashing blue grille lights and [[Wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wagging]] headlamps]]

The '''passive visual warnings''' are usually part of the design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches.  Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[Battenburg markings|Battenburg]]', named after a [[Battenberg cake|type of cake]]), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by [[3M]], only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]]) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact.

Another passive marking form is the word ''ambulance'' (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle. This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching ambulance in their [[rear view mirror]]s. Ambulances may display the name of their owner or operator, and an [[emergency telephone number]] for the ambulance service.

Ambulances may also carry an emblem (either as part of the passive warning markings or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the [[Emblems of the Red Cross|Protective Symbols]]). These are symbols laid down by the [[Geneva Convention]], and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national [[Red Cross]] or [[Red Crescent]] society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, [[Magen David Adom]], the Red Cross member organization use a red [[Star of David]], but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.

The [[Star of Life]] is widely used, and was originally designed and governed by the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.gov/vgn-ext-templating/ems/sol/pages/Contents.htm|title=Star of Life DOT HS 808 721|publisher=National Highway Safety Administration|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> because the Red Cross symbol is legally protected by both National<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.ca/article.asp?id=000340&tid=019|title=The Red Cross Emblem|publisher=The Canadian Red Cross|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> and international<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/emblem-history|title=The History of the Emblems|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions|title=The Geneva Convention of 1949|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=19 November 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091122011212/http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions| archivedate= 22 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> law. It indicates that the vehicle's operators can render their given level of care represented on the six pointed star.

Ambulance services that have historical origins such as the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St John]], the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]]<ref>www.orderofmalta.ie</ref> and [[Malteser International]]<ref>[http://www.malteser.de/61.malteser_international/en/default_en.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> often use the [[Maltese cross]] to identify their ambulances. This is especially important in countries such as Australia, where [[St. John Ambulance]] operate one state and one territory ambulance service, and all of Australia's other ambulance services use variations on a red Maltese cross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/about/default.asp|title=About Queensland Ambulance Service|accessdate=27 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070706071845/http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/about/default.asp| archivedate= 6 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulance.act.gov.au/|title=ACT Ambulance Service|accessdate=27 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070630131352/http://www.ambulance.act.gov.au/| archivedate= 30 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asnsw.health.nsw.gov.au/|title=Ambulance Service of New South Wales|accessdate=27 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070607030731/http://www.asnsw.health.nsw.gov.au/index.html |archivedate = 7 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saambulance.com.au/|title=South Australian Ambulance Service|accessdate=27 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070625084647/http://www.saambulance.com.au/| archivedate= 25 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Active visual warnings===
{{Main|Emergency vehicle lighting}}
[[File:DNK ambulance A6.jpg|thumb|An ambulance in Denmark with roof-integrated LED lights, plus side-view mirror, grill and front fend-off lights, and fog lamps wig-wags]]
The '''active visual warnings''' are usually in the form of flashing lights. These flash in order to attract the attention of other road users as the ambulance approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped ambulance in a dangerous position on the road. Common colours for ambulance warning beacons are blue, red, amber, and white (clear). However the colours may vary by country and sometimes by operator.

There are several technologies in use to achieve the flashing effect. These include flashing a [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]] or [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], and [[strobe light]]s, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights.  Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance).  Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing.

Emergency lights may be housed in special fittings, such as in a [[lightbar]], or may be hidden in a host light (such as a [[headlamp]]) by drilling a hole in the host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light.  These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated.  Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. [[headlamps]], tail lamps) may be programmed to flash.  Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]].

In order to increase safety, it is best practice to have 360° coverage with the active warnings, improving the chance of the vehicle being seen from all sides. In some countries, such as the United States, this may be mandatory.

===Audible warnings===
{{Main|Emergency vehicle equipment#Audible Warning Devices (Sirens)|l1=Audible warning devices}}

[[File:Whelen.ogg|thumb|right|A Whelen(R) siren with ''wail'', ''yelp'' and ''phaser'' tones is a common sound in many cities]]
In addition to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with '''audible warnings''', sometimes known as [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]]s, which can alert people and vehicles to the presence of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.<ref>{{cite book|others=The Canadian Red Cross|title=Emergency Care Manual|publisher=The StayWell Health Company|location=Guelph, ON|year=2008|page=359|chapter=23|isbn=978-1-58480-404-8|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>

The speakers for modern sirens can be integral to the lightbar, or they may be hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside the ambulance that may interfere with patient care and radio communications. Ambulances can additionally be fitted with [[airhorn]] audible warnings to augment the effectiveness of the siren system.

A recent development is the use of the [[Radio Data System|RDS]] system of [[Car audio|car radios]]. The ambulance is fitted with a short range [[Frequency modulation|FM]] transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, in the manner of a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2003/0164775.html|title=Emergency warning device – patent application|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> This feature is built in to every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Scott|title=The Broadcaster's Guide to RDS|publisher=Butterworth-Heineman|location=Woburn, MA|year=1997|page=73|isbn=0-240-80278-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MX0nKoHTQ_4C&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=RDS+Code+31&q=RDS%20Code%2031}}</ref>

==Service providers==

Some countries closely regulate the industry (and may require anyone working on an ambulance to be qualified to a set level), whereas others allow quite wide differences between types of operator.

*'''Government Ambulance Service''' – Operating separately from (although alongside) the fire and police service of the area, these ambulances are funded by local or national government. In some countries, these only tend to be found in big cities, whereas in countries such as Great Britain almost all emergency ambulances are part of a nationwide system under the [[National Health Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/aboutnhsservices/emergencyandurgentcareservices/pages/ambulanceservices.aspx|title=UK NHS Ambulance Service Information|accessdate=1 November 2009|publisher=NHS Direct| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091030014139/http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/Emergencyandurgentcareservices/Pages/Ambulanceservices.aspx| archivedate= 30 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In Canada ambulance services are normally operated by local municipalities or provincial health agencies as a separate entity from fire or police services.
*'''Fire or Police Linked Service''' – In countries such as the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and France ambulances can be operated by the local fire or police service. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective. In some cases this can lead to an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as a [[fire apparatus|fire truck]].
*'''Volunteer Ambulance Service''' –  Charities or non-profit companies operate ambulances, both in an emergency and patient transport function. This may be along similar lines to volunteer fire companies, providing the main service for an area, and either community or privately owned. They may be linked to a voluntary [[fire department]], with volunteers providing both services. There are charities who focus on providing ambulances for the community, or for cover at private events (sports etc.). The [[Red Cross]] provides this service across the world on a volunteer basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=94508|title=British Red Cross Event First Aid service|accessdate=2 June 2010|publisher=British Red Cross}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> (and in others as a Private Ambulance Service), as do other smaller organisations such as [[St John Ambulance]]<ref name=SJA2>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/event-first-aid-cover.aspx|title=St John Ambulance First Aid Cover for Events|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070527164551/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/event-first-aid-cover.aspx| archivedate= 27 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://195.218.114.18/orderofmalta/global/site/what-we-do.asp?id=15|title=Order of Malta Ambulance Corps|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Order of Malta Ambulance Corps}}</ref> These volunteer ambulances may be seen providing support to the full-time ambulance crews during times of emergency. In some cases the volunteer charity may employ paid members of staff alongside volunteers to operate a full-time ambulance service, such in some parts of Australia and in Ireland.
*'''Private Ambulance Service''' – Normal commercial companies with paid employees, but often on contract to the local or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as [[Falck (Denmark)|Falck]], [[Acadian Ambulance]], and [[American Medical Response]] are some of the larger companies that provide such services.  These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstaidservices.net.au|title=First Aid Services|accessdate=31 March 2009|publisher=First Aid Services}}</ref> From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.
*'''Combined Emergency Service''' – these are full service emergency service agencies, which may be found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They may be found in smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows to make the most of limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.
*'''Hospital Based Service''' – Hospitals may provide their own ambulance service as a service to the community, or where ambulance care is unreliable or chargeable. Their use would be dependent on using the services of the providing hospital.
*'''Charity Ambulance''' – This special type of ambulance is provided by a charity for the purpose of taking sick children or adults on trips or vacations away from hospitals, hospices or care homes where they are in long term care. Examples include the UK's 'Jumbulance' project.<ref name=jumbulance/>
*'''Company Ambulance''' – Many large factories and other industrial centres, such as [[chemical plant]]s, [[oil refineries]], [[breweries]] and [[distilleries]], have ambulance services provided by employers as a means of protecting their interests and the welfare of their staff. These are often used as first response vehicles in the event of a fire or explosion.

==Costs==
The cost of an ambulance ride may be paid for from several sources, and this will depend on the type of service being provided, by whom, and possibly who to.
*'''Government funded service''' – The full or the majority of the cost of transport by ambulance is borne by the local, regional, or national government (through their normal taxation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/ohip/amb.html|title=OHIP:Ambulance Services Billing|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>
*'''Privately funded service''' – Transport by ambulance is paid for by the patient themselves, or through their insurance company.  This may be at the point of care (i.e. payment or guarantee must be made before treatment or transport), although this may be an issue with critically injured patients, unable to provide such details, or via a system of billing later on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amr.net/Patients-and-Family-Members/Payment-Policy.aspx|title=Payment Policy|publisher=American Medical Response|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>
*'''Charity funded service''' – Transport by ambulance may be provided free of charge to patients by a charity, although donations may be sought for services received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireairambulance.org.uk/|title=Yorkshire Air Ambulance Charity|accessdate=19 November 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091125202654/http://www.yorkshireairambulance.org.uk/| archivedate= 25 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
*'''Hospital funded service''' – Hospitals may provide the ambulance transport free of charge, on the condition that patients use the hospital's services (which they may have to pay for).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vic.pvhs.org/portal/page?_pageid=333,429645&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&pagid=108|title=Ambulance Services|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>

==Crewing==
[[File:Pretoria paramedics.jpg|thumb|right|Various ambulance crews help to load a patient into an [[air ambulance]] in [[Pretoria]]]]
There are differing levels of qualification that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board. Most ambulance services require at least two crew members to be on every ambulance (one to drive, and one to attend the patient), although response cars may have a sole crew member, possibly backed up by another double-crewed ambulance. It may be the case that only the attendant need be qualified, and the driver might have no medical training. In some locations, an [[advanced life support]] ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.

Common ambulance crew qualifications are:
#'''[[Certified first responder|First responder]]''' – A person who arrives first at the scene of an incident,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/FirstRsp.htm|title=Role of the First Responder|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Resuscitation Council UK| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070529155100/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/FirstRsp.htm| archivedate= 29 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and whose job is to provide early critical care such as [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) or using an [[automated external defibrillator]] (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, or may be dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.
#'''Ambulance Driver''' – Some services employ staff with no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) whose job is to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified  providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.
#'''[[Ambulance Care Assistant]]''' – Have varying levels of training across the world, but these staff are usually only required to perform patient transport duties (which can include stretcher or [[wheelchair]] cases), rather than acute care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=907|title=Ambulance Care Assistant Role|accessdate=1 November 2009|publisher=nhs| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091125230105/http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=907| archivedate= 25 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Dependent on provider, they may be trained in first aid or extended skills such as use of an AED, oxygen therapy and other lifesaving or [[palliative]] skills. They may provide emergency cover when other units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.
#'''[[Emergency care assistant|Emergency Care Assistant/Emergency Care Support Workers]]''' – Also known as ECA/ECSW are members of a frontline ambulance that drive the vehicles under both emergency and non-emergency conditions to incidents.  There role is to assist the clinician that they are working with either a Technician or Paramedic in there duties whether that be drawing up drugs, setting up fluids (but not attaching), doing basic observations or performing 12 lead ECG assessments.
#'''[[Emergency medical technician]]''' – Also known as Ambulance Technician. Technicians are usually able to perform a wide range of emergency care skills, such as [[defibrillation]], spinal immobilization, bleeding control, splinting of suspected fractures, assisting the patient with certain medications, and [[oxygen therapy]]. Some countries split this term in to levels (such as in the US, where there is [[Emergency medical technician - basic|EMT-Basic]] and [[Emergency medical technician - intermediate|EMT-Intermediate]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/kidscareers/emt.htm|title=US Government Careers advice on EMT|accessdate=2 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070607123558/http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/kidscareers/emt.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
#'''[[Paramedic]]''' – This is a high level of medical training and usually involves key skills not permissible for technicians, such as [[Intravenous therapy|cannulation]] (and with it the ability to administer a range of drugs such as [[morphine]]), [[tracheal intubation]] and other skills such as performing a [[cricothyrotomy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=National Occupational Competency Profile|publisher=Paramedic Association of Canada|year=2001|pages=96–97|url=http://www.paramedic.ca/Content.aspx?ContentID=4&ContentTypeID=2|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> Dependent on jurisdiction, the title "paramedic" can be a protected title, and use of it without the relevant qualification may result in criminal prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/|title=UK Health Care Professionals Council advice on use of protected titles|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Health care Professionals council}}</ref>

#'''[[Emergency Care Practitioner]]''' – This position, sometimes called 'Super Paramedic' in the media, is designed to bridge the link between ambulance care and the care of a [[general practitioner]].

==Military use==
[[File:VAMTAC ambulancia.JPG|thumb|An [[URO VAMTAC]] ambulance of the [[Spanish Army]] emblazoned with the [[Emblems of the Red Cross|Red Cross]]]]
Military ambulances include both ambulances based on civilian designs and armored, but unarmed ambulances based upon [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs) such as the British [[FV104 Samaritan]] and the U.S. [[M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle]]. Civilian based designs may be painted in olive, white or other colours, depending on the operational requirements – the British [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters often function as air ambulances, since they are extremely useful for [[MEDEVAC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.century-of-flight.freeola.com/Aviation%20history/helicopter%20history/M.A.S.H.%20Medevac%20Helicopters.htm|title=History of Military MEDEVAC helicopters|accessdate=2 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070617052953/http://www.century-of-flight.freeola.com/Aviation%20history/helicopter%20history/M.A.S.H.%20Medevac%20Helicopters.htm| archivedate= 17 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Due to the inherently hazardous situation of a battle ground, military ambulances are often armored, or based upon [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFV). Since [[laws of war]] demand ambulances marked with one of the [[Emblems of the Red Cross]] not to mount offensive [[weapon]]s, an ambulance AFV is often unarmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView|title=International Committee of the Red Cross policy on usage|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=International committee of the Red Cross| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070706014427/http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView| archivedate= 6 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as [[non-combatant]]s; however, this application does not always exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire —accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic [[military training]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyjobs.mod.uk/jobs/pages/JobExplorerResults.aspx?category=6|title=UK Army information on basic training for medical personnel|accessdate=1 November 2009|publisher=British Army}}</ref> on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.

Recently, Israel has modified a number of its [[Merkava]] main battle [[tank]]s with ambulance features in order to allow rescue operations to take place under heavy fire in [[urban warfare]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/m/merkava-lic.htm|title=Defense Update page on use of Merkava tank as ambulance|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Defense Update| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070627140305/http://www.defense-update.com/products/m/merkava-lic.htm| archivedate= 27 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The modifications were made following a failed rescue attempt in which [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] gunmen killed two soldiers who were providing aid for a Palestinian woman in [[Rafah]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3713585.stm|title=BBC New article on the killing of soldiers rendering ambulance aid|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=BBC News | date=14 May 2004}}</ref> Since [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M-113]] armored personnel carriers and regular up-armored ambulances are not sufficiently protected against [[anti-tank]] weapons and [[improvised explosive device]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inetres.com/gp/military/cv/inf/M113.html|title=Technical data on armament of M113 APC Ambulance|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Inetres}}</ref> it was decided to use the heavily [[armor]]ed [[Merkava]] tank.

Some navies operate ocean-going [[hospital ship]]s to lend medical assistance in high casualty situations like wars or natural disasters.<ref name=ship1/> These hospital ships fulfill the criteria of an ambulance (transporting the sick or injured), although the capabilities of a hospital ship are more on par with a [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]. In line with the [[laws of war]], these ships can display a prominent Red Cross or Red Crescent to confer protection under the appropriate [[Geneva convention]].  However, this designation has not always protected hospital ships from enemy fire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report on the sinking of the HMHS Llandovery Castle|url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/lcastl11.htm|publisher=World War One Document Archive|accessdate=27 June 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070714232216/http://www.gwpda.org/naval/lcastl11.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Toronto’s City Council has begun a "Caravan of Hope" project to provide retired Toronto ambulances a second life by donating them to the people of El Salvador. Since the Province of Ontario requires that ambulances be retired after just four and a half years in service in Ontario, the City of Toronto decommissions and auctions 28 ambulances each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanlorenzo.ca/english/Supporting_Hope.html|title=Supporting hope |accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref>
