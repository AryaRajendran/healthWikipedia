'''''Human rhinoviruses''''' (from the Greek (gen.) "nose") are the most common viral infective agents in humans and are the predominant cause of the [[common cold]]. Rhinovirus infection proliferates in temperatures between 33–35&nbsp;°C (91–95&nbsp;°F), and this may be why it occurs primarily in the nose. Rhinovirus is a species in the genus ''[[Enterovirus]]'' of the ''[[Picornaviridae]]'' family of [[virus]]es.

There are 99 recognized types of Human rhinoviruses that differ according to their surface proteins. They are [[Lytic cycle|lytic]] in nature and are among the smallest viruses, with diameters of about 30 nanometers only. Other viruses such as [[smallpox]] and [[vaccinia]] are around 10 times larger at about 300 nanometers.

==Transmission and epidemiology==
{{Main|Common cold}}
There are two modes of transmission: via aerosols of respiratory droplets and from contaminated surfaces, including direct person-to-person contact.

Human rhinoviruses occur worldwide and are the primary cause of [[common cold]]s.  [[Symptom]]s include [[Pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[rhinitis|runny nose]], [[nasal congestion]], [[sneeze|sneezing]] and [[cough]]; sometimes accompanied by [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[malaise]], [[headache]], [[muscle weakness]], or [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]].  [[Fever]] and extreme [[fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] are more usual in [[influenza]].  Children may have six to twelve colds a year.  In the United States, the incidence of colds is higher in the autumn and winter, with most infections occurring between September to April.  The seasonality may be due to the start of the school year {{Citation needed|reason = This claim needs a source. The school year in the Southern Hemisphere starts in January, yet colds are still predominant in autumn & winter|date=March 2012}} and to people spending more time indoors (thus in proximity with each other){{Citation needed|reason = needs proof that people spend more time in proximity to each other, e.g. use public transport more, go to work more etc|date=March 2012}}, thereby increasing the chance of transmission of the virus. Lower ambient, especially outdoor, temperatures may also be a factor given that human rhinoviruses preferentially replicate at 32°C (89°F) as opposed to 37°C (98°F) - see following section.

==Pathogenesis==
The primary route of entry for Human rhinoviruses is the upper [[respiratory tract]].  Afterward, the virus binds to [[ICAM-1]] (Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1) also known as CD54 (Cluster of Differentiation 54) [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on respiratory epithelial cells.  As the virus replicates and spreads, infected cells release distress signals known as [[chemokine]]s and [[cytokine]]s (which in turn activate inflammatory mediators).

Infection occurs rapidly, with the virus adhering to surface receptors within 15 minutes of entering the respiratory tract.  Just over 50% of symptomatic individuals will experience symptoms within 2 days of infection.  Only about 5% of cases will have an  [[incubation period]] of less than 20 hours, and, on the other end, it is expected that 5% of cases would have an [[incubation period]] of greater than four and a half days.<ref name=Lessler_2009>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473309909700696/abstract?rss=yes|author=Lessler J, Reich NG, Brookmeyer R, Perl TM, Nelson KE, Cummings DAT.|title=Incubation periods of acute respiratory viral infections: a systematic review|journal = Lancet ID | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 291–300 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19393959 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70069-6}}</ref>

Human rhinoviruses preferentially grow at 32°C (89°F) as opposed to 37°C (98°F), hence infect the [[upper respiratory tract]].<!-- Can anyone add information as to why this temperature is here?  Is the lower respiratory tract's temperature 37°C (98.6°F)?  The page does not explain this very well, as it has no reference for this information, and no explanation.  (Possible answer: I would expect that the tissues subjected to respiratory airflow would be a bit cooler, the more so for those tissues closer to the exterior environment.) -->

==Taxonomy==
Rhinovirus was formerly a genus from the family ''[[Picornaviridae]]''. The 39th Executive Committee (EC39) of the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) met in Canada during June 2007 with new taxonomic proposals. In April 2008, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses voted and ratified the following changes:

*2005.264V.04 To '''remove the following species''' from the existing genus ''Rhinovirus'' in the family ''[[Picornaviridae]]'':
**Human rhinovirus A
**Human rhinovirus B
*2005.265V.04 To '''assign the following species''' to the genus ''[[Enterovirus]]'' in the family ''[[Picornaviridae]]'':
**Human rhinovirus A
**Human rhinovirus B
*2005.266V.04 To '''remove the existing genus''' ''Rhinovirus'' from the family ''[[Picornaviridae]]''. Note: The genus ''Rhinovirus'' hereby disappears.
<br>
In July 2009, the ICTV voted and ratified a proposal to add a third species, Human rhinovirus C to the genus Enterovirus.

*2008.084V.A.HRV-C-Sp 2008.084V To '''create a new species''' named Human rhinovirus C in the genus ''[[Enterovirus]]'', family ''[[Picornaviridae]]''.
<br>
There have been a total of 215 taxonomic proposals, which have been approved and ratified since the 8th [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]] Report of 2005.

Rhinovirus C, unlike the A and B species, may be able to cause severe infections.<ref name=Fuji2011>{{cite journal | author = Fuji N, Suzuki A, Lupisan S, Sombrero L, Galang H, Kamigaki T, Tamaki R, Saito M, Aniceto R ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Detection of human rhinovirus C viral Genome in blood among children with severe respiratory infections in the Philippines | url = | journal = PLoS One | volume = 6 | issue = 11| page = e27247 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...627247F | last2 = Suzuki | last3 = Lupisan | last4 = Sombrero | last5 = Galang | last6 = Kamigaki | last7 = Tamaki | last8 = Saito | last9 = Aniceto | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0027247 | editor1-last = Schulz | editor1-first = Thomas F }}</ref>

==Structure==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Rossmann.virus.jpeg|right|thumb|Picture of the Human rhinovirus 560, computer-generated-model.]] -->
Rhinoviruses have single-stranded positive sense [[RNA]] genomes of between 7.2 and 8.5 [[Base pair|kb]] in length.  At the 5' end of the [[genome]] is a virus-encoded protein, and like mammalian mRNA, there is a 3' [[poly-A tail]].  Structural proteins are encoded in the 5' region of the genome and non structural at the 3' end.  This is the same for all [[picornavirus]]es.  The viral particles themselves are not [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] and are [[icosahedral]] in structure.

The viral proteins are transcribed as a single, long polypeptide, which is cleaved into the structural and nonstructural viral proteins.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert B Couch |chapter=Rhinoviruses:Replication |chapterurl=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0000431/current/html#a0000431-sec1-0004 |editor=Anne O'Daly |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |publisher=John Wiley |year=2005 |isbn=0-470-01590-X }}</ref>

Human rhinoviruses are composed of a [[capsid]], that contains four viral [[proteins]] VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4.<ref name=Rossmann_1985>{{cite journal | author = Rossmann M, Arnold E, Erickson J, Frankenberger E, Griffith J, Hecht H, Johnson J, Kamer G, Luo M, Mosser A | title = Structure of a human common cold virus and functional relationship to other picornaviruses | journal = Nature | volume = 317 | issue = 6033 | pages = 145–53 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2993920 | doi = 10.1038/317145a0 | bibcode=1985Natur.317..145R}}</ref><ref name=Smith_1986>{{cite journal | author = Smith T, Kremer M, Luo M, Vriend G, Arnold E, Kamer G, Rossmann M, McKinlay M, Diana G, Otto M | title = The site of attachment in Human rhinovirus 14 for antiviral agents that inhibit uncoating | journal = Science | volume = 233 | issue = 4770 | pages = 1286–93 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3018924 | doi = 10.1126/science.3018924|bibcode = 1986Sci...233.1286S }}</ref>  VP1, VP2, and VP3 form the major part of the protein capsid.  The much smaller VP4 protein has a more extended structure, and lies at interface between the capsid and the RNA genome.  There are 60 copies of each of these proteins assembled as an [[icosahedron]].  Antibodies are a major defense against infection with the [[epitopes]] lying on the exterior regions of VP1-VP3.

==Novel antiviral drugs==
[[Interferon]]-alpha used intranasally was shown to be effective against Human rhinovirus infections.  However, volunteers treated with this drug experienced some side effects, such as nasal bleeding, and began developing [[Resistance to antiviral drugs|resistance]] to the drug.  Subsequently, research into the treatment was abandoned.

[[Pleconaril]] is an orally [[bioavailable]] [[antiviral drug]] being developed for the treatment of infections caused by [[picornaviruses]].<ref name=Pevear_1999>{{cite journal | author = Pevear D, Tull T, Seipel M, Groarke J | title = Activity of pleconaril against enteroviruses | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 2109–15 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10471549 | pmc = 89431}}</ref>  This drug acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in VP1, and stabilizes the protein capsid to such an extent that the virus cannot release its RNA genome into the target cell.  When tested in volunteers, during the clinical trials, this drug caused a significant decrease in [[mucus]] secretions and illness-associated [[symptoms]].  Pleconaril is not currently available for treatment of Human rhinoviral infections, as its efficacy in treating these infections is under further evaluation.<ref name=Fleisher_2003>{{cite journal | author = Fleischer R, Laessig K | title = Safety and efficacy evaluation of pleconaril for treatment of the common cold | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 37 | issue = 12 | pages = 1722 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14689362 | doi = 10.1086/379830}}</ref>

[[DRACO (antiviral)|DRACO]], a broad-spectrum antiretroviral therapy being developed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus, as well as a number of other infectious viruses.<ref name="pmid21818340">{{cite journal |author=Rider TH, Zook CE, Boettcher TL, Wick ST, Pancoast JS, Zusman BD |title=Broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e22572 |year=2011 |pmid=21818340 |pmc=3144912 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022572 |editor1-last=Sambhara |editor1-first=Suryaprakash}}</ref><ref name="Macrae">{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2024492/Greatest-discovery-penicillin-Scientists-work-drug-cure-viruses--including-flu.html |title=Greatest discovery since penicillin: A cure for everything - from colds to HIV |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK |author=Fiona Macrae | date=11 August 2011 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

There are potentially other substances such as [[Iota-Carrageenan]] that may lead to the creation of drugs to combat the Human rhinovirus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grassauer A, Weinmuellner R, Meier C, Pretsch A, Prieschl-Grassauer E, Unger H |title=Iota-Carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of Human rhinovirus infection |journal=Virol.

In Asthma: Human rhinoviruses have been recently associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations for which current therapy is inadequate. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) has a central role in airway inflammation in asthma, and it is the receptor for 90% of Human rhinoviruses. Human rhinovirus infection of airway epithelium induces ICAM-1. Desloratadine and loratadine are compounds belonging to the new class of H1-receptor blockers. Anti-inflammatory properties of antihistamines have been recently documented, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely defined. These effects are unlikely to be mediated by H1-receptor antagonism and suggest a novel mechanism of action that may be important for the therapeutic control of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Vaccine==
There are no [[vaccines]] against these viruses as there is little-to-no cross-protection between [[serotype]]s.  At least 99 serotypes of Human rhinoviruses affecting humans have been [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]].<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-cold13-2009feb13,0,6469591.story | title = Rhinovirus strains' genomes decoded; cold cure-all is unlikely: The strains are probably too different for a single treatment or vaccine to apply to all varieties, scientists say | author = Mary Engel | date = February 13, 2009 | newspaper = Los Angeles Times }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1165557 | title = Sequencing and Analyses of All Known Human rhinovirus Genomes Reveals Structure and Evolution | year = 2009 | author = Palmenberg, A.
