'''Bisphosphonates''' (also called '''diphosphonates''') are a class of drugs that prevent the loss of bone mass, used to treat [[osteoporosis]] and similar diseases. They  are the most commonly prescribed drugs used to treat osteoporosis.<ref name="Nat Osteo Soc">{{cite web|last=National Osteoporosis Society|title=Drug Treatment|url=http://www.nos.org.uk/page.aspx?pid=264&srcid=234|publisher=U.K. National Osteoporosis Society|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> They are called bisphosphonates because they have two [[phosphonate]] ({{chem|PO|3}}) groups and are similar in structure to [[pyrophosphate]].

Evidence shows that they reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture in those who have had previous fractures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wells G, Cranney A, Peterson J, ''et al.'' |title=Risedronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD004523 |year=2008 |pmid=18254053 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004523.pub3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wells GA, Cranney A, Peterson J, ''et al.'' |title=Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD001155 |year=2008 |pmid=18253985 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001155.pub2 }}</ref>

Bone undergoes constant turnover and is kept in balance ([[homeostasis]]) by [[osteoblasts]] creating bone and [[osteoclasts]] destroying bone. Bisphosphonates inhibit the digestion of bone by encouraging osteoclasts to undergo [[apoptosis]], or cell death, thereby slowing bone loss.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinstein RS, Roberson PK, Manolagas SC |title=Giant osteoclast formation and long-term oral bisphosphonate therapy |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=360 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19118304 |pmc=2866022 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0802633 }}</ref>

The uses of bisphosphonates include the prevention and treatment of [[osteoporosis]], [[osteitis deformans]] ("[[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]] of bone"), [[bone metastasis]] (with or without [[hypercalcaemia]]), [[multiple myeloma]], [[primary hyperparathyroidism]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], and other conditions that feature bone fragility.

==Medical uses==
Most [[physicians]] use bisphosphonates to treat [[osteoporosis]], [[osteitis deformans]] (Paget's disease of the bone), bone [[metastasis]] (with or without [[hypercalcaemia]]), [[multiple myeloma]], and other conditions involving fragile, breakable bone. In osteoporosis and Paget's, the most popular first-line bisphosphonate drugs are [[alendronate]] ([[Merck & Co.|Merck]]) and [[risedronate]]. If these are ineffective or if the patient develops digestive tract problems, intravenous [[pamidronate]] ([[Novartis]]) may be used. [[Strontium ranelate]] or [[teriparatide]] ([[Eli Lilly]]) are used for refractory disease; and in postmenopausal women, the [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] [[raloxifene]] is occasionally administered instead of bisphosphonates.

High-potency intravenous bisphosphonates have been shown to modify progression of skeletal metastasis in several forms of cancer, especially [[breast cancer]].  In one randomized control trial, women with breast cancer who received [[zoledronic acid]] had a 36% reduction in risk for a recurrence of breast cancer in the same breast, a new cancer in the other breast, or metastasis to bone compared to women who did not receive zoledronic acid.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gnant M, Mlineritsch B, Schippinger W, ''et al.'' |title=Endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid in premenopausal breast cancer |journal=N.

Other bisphosphonates, including [[medronate]] ({{chem|R|1}}, {{chem|R|2|=H}}) and [[oxidronate]] ({{chem|R|1|=H}}, {{chem|R|2|=OH}}), are mixed with radioactive [[technetium]] and injected, as a way to image bone and detect bone disease. Bisphosphonates have been used to reduce fracture rates in children with the disease [[osteogenesis imperfecta]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shapiro JR, Sponsellor PD |title=Osteogenesis imperfecta: questions and answers |journal=Curr. Opin.

==Adverse effects==

===Common===
Oral bisphosphonates can cause upset [[stomach]] and [[esophagitis|inflammation]] and erosions of the [[esophagus]], which is the main problem of oral ''N''-containing preparations. This can be prevented by remaining seated upright for 30 to 60 minutes after taking the medication. Intravenous bisphosphonates can give fever and [[flu-like symptoms]] after the first infusion, which is thought to occur because of their potential to activate human [[gamma/delta T cells|γδ T cells]]. These symptoms do not recur with subsequent infusions.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Bisphosphonates, when administered intravenously for the treatment of cancer, have been associated with [[bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw|osteonecrosis of the jaw]] (ONJ), with the [[mandible]] twice as frequently affected as the [[maxilla]] and most cases occurring following high-dose intravenous administration used for some cancer patients. Some 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure (that involve the bone), and it has been suggested that bisphosphonate treatment should be postponed until after any dental work to eliminate potential sites of infection (the use of antibiotics may otherwise be indicated prior to any surgery).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woo S, Hellstein J, Kalmar J | title = Narrative [corrected] review: bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaws | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 144 | issue = 10 | pages = 753–61 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16702591}}</ref>

===Long-term risks===
In large studies, women taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis have had unusual fractures ("bisphosphonate fractures") in the [[femur]] (thigh bone) in the shaft ([[diaphysis]] or [[Human trochanter|sub-trochanteric]] region) of the bone, rather than at the head of the bone, which is the most common site of fracture. However, these unusual fractures are extremely rare (12 in 14,195 women) compared to the common hip fractures (272 in 14,195 women), and the overall reduction in hip fractures caused by bisphosphonate far outweighed the unusual shaft fractures.<ref name="Shane">{{cite journal |author=Shane E |title=Evolving data about subtrochanteric fractures and bisphosphonates |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=362 |issue=19 |pages=1825–7 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20335574 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe1003064 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/362/19/1825}}</ref> There are concerns that long-term bisphosphonate use can result in over-suppression of [[bone turnover]]. It is hypothesized that micro-cracks in the bone are unable to heal and eventually unite and propagate, resulting in atypical fractures. Such fractures tend to heal poorly and often require some form of bone stimulation, for example [[bone grafting]] as a secondary procedure. This complication is not common, and the benefit of overall fracture reduction still holds.<ref name="Shane"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lenart BA, Lorich DG, Lane JM |title=Atypical fractures of the femoral diaphysis in postmenopausal women taking alendronate |journal=N.

A 2010 study suggests that the risk of [[oesophageal cancer]] increased with 10 or more prescriptions for oral bisphosphonates and with prescriptions over about a five-year period. In Europe and North America, the incidence of oesophageal cancer at age 60–79 is typically 1 per 1000 population over five years, and this is estimated to increase to about 2 per 1000 with five years' use of oral bisphosphonates.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1136/bmj.c4444}}</ref> There have been conflicting findings from studies evaluating the risk of [[esophageal cancer]]. [[Esophagitis]] and other esophageal events have been reported, particularly in patients who do not follow the specific directions for use of oral bisphosphonates.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/fda/oral-osteoporosis-bisphosphonates-safety-communication-potential-increased-risk-esophageal-cancer-13003.html</ref>

== Chemistry and classes ==
All bisphosphonate drugs share a common P-C-P "backbone":

The two {{chem|PO|3}} ([[phosphonate]]) groups [[covalent]]ly linked to [[carbon]] determine both the name "bis''phospho''nate" and the function of the drugs. ''Bis'' refers to the fact that there are two such groups in the molecule.

The long ''[[side-chain]]'' ('''{{chem|R|2}}''' in the diagram) determines the chemical properties, the mode of action and the strength of bisphosphonate drugs. The short ''side-chain'' ({{chem|R|1}}), often called the 'hook', mainly influences chemical properties and [[pharmacokinetics]].

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Of the bisphosphonate that is resorbed (from oral preparation) or infused (for [[intravenous]] drugs), about 50% is excreted unchanged by the kidney. The remainder has a very high affinity for [[bone tissue]], and is rapidly adsorbed onto the bone surface.

== Mechanism of action ==
Bisphosphonates' mechanisms of action all stem from their structures' similarity to [[pyrophosphate]] (see figure above). A bisphosphonate group mimics pyrophosphate's structure, thereby inhibiting activation of enzymes that utilize pyrophosphate.

Bisphosphonate-based drugs' specificity comes from the two phosphonate groups (and possibly a hydroxyl at {{chem|R|1}}) that work together to coordinate calcium ions. Bisphosphonate molecules preferentially "stick" to calcium and bind to it. The largest store of calcium in the human body is in bones, so bisphosphonates accumulate to a high concentration only in bones.

Bisphosphonates, when attached to bone tissue, are "ingested" by [[osteoclast]]s, the bone cells that break down bone tissue.

There are two classes of ''bisphosphonate'': the ''[[nitrogen|N]]''-containing and non-''N''-containing bisphosphonates. The two types of bisphosphonates work differently in killing osteoclast cells.

[[Image:Bisphosphonate side chains.png|350px|right|side chains of bisphosphonate molecules]]

=== Non-nitrogenous ===
Non-''N''-containing bisphosphonates:
* [[Etidronic acid|Etidronate]] (Didronel) — 1 (potency relative to that of etidronate)
* [[Clodronate]] (Bonefos, Loron) — 10
* [[Tiludronate]] (Skelid) — 10

The non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates(disphosphonates) are [[metabolism|metabolised]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] to compounds that replace the terminal pyrophosphate moiety of ATP, forming a nonfunctional molecule that competes with [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) in the cellular energy metabolism. The osteoclast initiates [[apoptosis]] and dies, leading to an overall decrease in the breakdown of bone.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Frith J, Mönkkönen J, Blackburn G, Russell R, Rogers M | title = Clodronate and liposome-encapsulated clodronate are metabolized to a toxic ATP analog, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-dichloromethylene) triphosphate, by mammalian cells in vitro | journal = J Bone Miner Res | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 1358–67 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9286751 | doi = 10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.9.1358}}</ref>

=== Nitrogenous ===
''N''-containing bisphosphonates:
* [[Pamidronate]] (APD, Aredia) — 100
* [[Neridronate]] (Nerixia<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/international/nerixia.html (not sold in the United States)]</ref>) — 100
* [[Olpadronate]] — 500
* [[Alendronate]] (Fosamax) — 500
* [[Ibandronate]] (Boniva) — 1000
* [[Risedronate]] (Actonel) — 2000
* [[Zoledronate]] (Zometa, Aclasta) — 10000

Nitrogenous bisphosphonates act on bone metabolism by binding and blocking the enzyme [[farnesyl diphosphate synthase]] (FPPS) in the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]] (also known as the mevalonate pathway).<ref>{{cite journal | author = van Beek E, Cohen L, Leroy I, Ebetino F, Löwik C, Papapoulos S | title = Differentiating the mechanisms of antiresorptive action of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates | journal = Bone | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 805–11 | year = 2003 | month = November | pmid = 14623056 | doi = 10.1016/j.bone.2003.07.007}}</ref>

[[Image:HMG-CoA reductase pathway.png|thumb|right|HMG-CoA reductase pathway]]
Disruption of the HMG CoA-reductase pathway at the level of FPPS prevents the formation of two metabolites ([[farnesol]] and [[geranylgeraniol]]) that are essential for connecting some small proteins to the [[cell membrane]]. This phenomenon is known as prenylation, and is important for proper sub-cellular protein trafficking (see "''[[lipid-anchored protein]]''" for the principles of this phenomenon).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Van Beek E, Löwik C, van der Pluijm G, Papapoulos S | title = The role of geranylgeranylation in bone resorption and its suppression by bisphosphonates in fetal bone explants in vitro: A clue to the mechanism of action of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates | journal = J Bone Miner Res | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 722–9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10320520 | doi = 10.1359/jbmr.1999.14.5.722}}</ref>

While inhibition of protein prenylation may affect many proteins found in an [[osteoclast]], disruption to the lipid modification of [[Ras (protein)|Ras]], [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]], [[Rac (GTPase)|Rac]] proteins has been speculated to underlie the effects of bisphosphonates. These proteins can affect both osteoclastogenesis, cell survival, and cytoskeletal dynamics. In particular, the cytoskeleton is vital for maintaining the "ruffled border" that is required for contact between a resorbing osteoclast and a bone surface.

[[Statin]]s are another class of drugs that inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. Unlike bisphosphonates, statins do not bind to bone surfaces with high affinity, and thus are not specific for bone. Nevertheless, some studies have reported a decreased rate of [[fracture (bone)|fracture]] (an indicator of [[osteoporosis]]) and/or an increased [[bone mineral density]] in statin users. The overall efficacy of statins in the treatment osteoporosis remains controversial.<ref name=Uzzan2007>{{cite journal| last=Uzzan| first=B| coauthors=et al.| title=Effects of statins on bone mineral density: a meta-analysis of clinical studies| journal=Bone| year=2007| volume=40| issue=6| pages=1581–7| doi=10.1016/j.bone.2007.02.019| pmid=17409043| url=http://www.thebonejournal.com/article/S8756-3282(07)00102-0/abstract| accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref>

==History==
Bisphosphonates were developed in the 19th century but were first investigated in the 1960s for use in disorders of bone metabolism. Their non-medical use was to soften water in irrigation systems used in orange groves. The initial rationale for their use in humans was their potential in preventing the dissolution of [[hydroxylapatite]], the principal bone mineral, thus arresting bone loss. Only in the 1990s was their actual mechanism of action demonstrated with the initial launch of [[Fosamax]] (alendronate) by [[Merck & Co.]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fleisch H | title = Development of bisphosphonates | journal = Breast Cancer Res | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–4 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11879557 | doi = 10.1186/bcr414 | pmc = 138713}}</ref>
