'''Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins ''' [[Order of Merit|OM]] [[Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1948.0022}}</ref> (20 June 1861 – 16 May 1947) was an English [[biochemist]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1929, with [[Christiaan Eijkman]], for the discovery of [[vitamin]]s. He also discovered the amino acid [[tryptophan]], in 1901. He was [[President of the Royal Society]] from 1930 to 1935.

==Biography==
Hopkins was born in [[Eastbourne]], [[Sussex]], and educated at the [[City of London School]] completing his further study with the [[University of London External Programme]] and the medical school at [[Guy's Hospital]] which is now part of [[King's College London]] School of Medicine.<ref name="Hopkins Obit">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsnr.1962.0014}}</ref> He then taught physiology and toxicology at [[Guy's Hospital]] from 1894 to 1898.

In 1898 he married [[Jessie Anne Stephens]]; they had two daughters, one of whom, [[Jacquetta Hawkes]], was married to [[J.B. Priestley]], the author. 

Also in 1898, while attending a meeting of the [[Physiological Society]], he was invited by Sir Michael Foster to join the Physiological Laboratory in Cambridge to investigate the chemical aspects of physiology. [[Biochemistry]] was not, at that time, recognized as a separate branch of science. In 1902 he was given a readership in biochemistry, and in 1910 he became a Fellow of Trinity College, and an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel College. In 1914 he was elected to the Chair of Biochemistry at Cambridge University, thus becoming the first Professor in that discipline at Cambridge.<ref>{{Venn|id=HPKS900FG|name=Hopkins, Frederick Gowland}}</ref> His Cambridge students included neurochemistry pioneer [[Judah Hirsch Quastel]].

Hopkins had for a long time studied how cells obtain energy via a complex metabolic process of oxidation and reduction reactions. His study in 1907 with [[Sir Walter Morley Fletcher]] of the connection between lactic acid and muscle contraction was one of the central achievements of his work on the biochemistry of the cell. He and Fletcher showed that oxygen depletion causes an accumulation of lactic acid in the muscle. Their work paved the way for the later discovery by [[Archibald Hill]] and [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]] that a carbohydrate metabolic cycle supplies the energy used for muscle contraction.

In 1912 Hopkins published the work for which he is best known, demonstrating in a series of animal feeding experiments that diets consisting of pure proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and water fail to support animal growth. This led him to suggest the existence in normal diets of tiny quantities of as yet unidentified substances that are essential for animal growth and survival. These hypothetical substances he called “accessory food factors”, later renamed vitamins.<ref>{{cite pmid|16993143}}</ref> It was this work that led his being awarded (together with [[Christiaan Eijkman]]) the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physiology for Medicine.

During [[World War I]], Hopkins continued his work on the nutritional value of vitamins. His efforts were especially valuable in a time of food shortages and rationing. He agreed to study the nutritional value of margarine and found that it was, as suspected, inferior to butter because it lacked the vitamins A and D. As a result of his work, vitamin-enriched margarine was introduced in 1926. 

Hopkins is credited with the discovery and characterization in 1921 of [[glutathione]] extracted from various animal tissues.<ref>{{cite pmid|12055201}}</ref> At the time he proposed that the compound was a dipeptide of [[glutamic acid]] and [[cysteine]]. The structure was controversial for many years but in 1929 he concluded that it was a tripeptide of [[glutamic acid]], [[cysteine]] and [[glycine]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/84/1/269.full.pdf|author=Hopkins, Frederick Gowland |year=1929|title=On Glutathione: A Reinvestigation|journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=84 |pages=269–320}}</ref> This conclusion agreed with that from the independent work of [[Edward Calvin Kendall]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hwmaint.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/84/2/657|author=Kendall, Edward C.; McKenzie, Bernard F.; Mason, Harold L.|year=1929|title=A Study of Glutathione. I. Its Preparation in Crystalline Form and its Identification|journal= J. Biol. Chem. |volume=84 |pages=657–674}}</ref>

During his life, in addition to the Nobel Prize, Hopkins was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1918 and the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1926. Other significant honours were his election in 1905 to fellowship in the Royal Society, Great Britain’s most prestigious scientific organization; his knighthood by King George V in 1925; and the award in 1935 of the [[Order of Merit]], Great Britain’s most exclusive civilian honor. From 1930 -1935 he served as president of the [[Royal Society]] and in 1933 served as President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. 

He died on May 16, 1947 in Cambridge and is buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge, with wife Lady [[Jessie Ann Hopkins]],<ref>A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. Mark Goldie, pages 62 and 63 (2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.trinitycollegechapel.com/about/memorials/brasses/hopkins/ Trinity College Chapel]</ref>
