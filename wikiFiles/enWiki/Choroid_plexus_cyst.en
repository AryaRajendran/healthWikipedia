'''Choroid plexus cysts''' (CPCs) are [[cyst]]s that occur within [[choroid plexus]] of the brain. The brain contains pockets or spaces called [[ventricular system|ventricles]] with a spongy layer of cells and blood vessels called the [[choroid plexus]].  This is in the middle of the fetal brain.  The choroid plexus has the important function of producing a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid produced by the cells of the choroid plexus fills the ventricles and then flows around the brain and the spinal cord to provide a cushion of fluid around these structures.

CPCs can form within this structure and come from fluid trapped within this spongy layer of cells, much like a soap bubble or a blister.  CPCs are often called "soft signs" or fetal ultrasound "markers" because some studies have found a weak association between CPCs and fetal chromosome abnormalities.

It is believed that many adults have one or more tiny CPCs.<ref name="pmid15832013">{{cite journal |author=Jeon JH, Lee SW, Ko JK, ''et al.'' |title=Neuroendoscopic removal of large choroid plexus cyst: a case report |journal=J.

The fetal brain may create these cysts as a normal part of development. They are temporary and usually are gone by the 32nd week of pregnancy.

==Chromosome problems==
[[Genetic counseling]] is often recommended to provide more information about fetal CPCs,  to answer questions and concerns, and to outline available options such as [[amniocentesis]] or a blood test from the mother. There is a possible association between ultrasound-detected fetal CPCs and [[chromosome]] problems in the baby. Types of chromosome problems that are occasionally seen include [[Trisomy 18]]<ref name="pmid17357350">{{cite journal |author=Hurt K, Sottner O, Záhumenský J, ''et al.'' |title=[Choroid plexus cysts and risk of trisomy 18.

Generally the risks are very low if there are no other risk factors. 

A recent study found that of 106,732 women under the age of 35 that had an isolated CPC identified in a fetal ultrasound, that actually none of the cases had resulted in trisomy 18; the study concluded that "there is no evidence that detection of isolated choroid plexus cyst in women who are <35 years of age increases the risk of trisomy 18".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Demasio|first=K|coauthors=Canterino, J; Ananth, C; Fernandez, C; Smulian, J; Vintzileos, A|title=Isolated choroid plexus cyst in low-risk women less than 35 years old.|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology|date=2002 Nov|volume=187|issue=5|pages=1246–9|pmid=12439513}}</ref>  Yet some studies have estimated up to a 1% (1/100) chance of delivering a baby with a chromosome problem when there is a CPC present.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

Other factors which may have a bearing on the baby's chances of developing chromosome problems include:

* mother's age at the expected date of delivery
* the results of serum screening; XAFP [[triple test]]ing or quad screening
* evidence of other "fetal findings" seen at the time of the ultrasound that may suggest a chromosome problem

Many babies with chromosome problems do not show any signs on ultrasound.
