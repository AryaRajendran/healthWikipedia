The '''Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN)''' Foundation is a [[Nonprofit organization]] composed of scientists and adult and pediatric cancer researchers who work together to develop new treatments for [[Ependymoma]], a type of primary brain or spinal cord tumor that occurs in both children and adults, and improve the outcomes and care of patients.<ref>[http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/departments-programs-and-labs/departments-and-divisions/neuro-oncology/research/index.html "MD Anderson Cancer Center, Research"], 2012-10-08</ref>   The organization is headquartered in [[Dayton, Ohio]], USA.<ref name="About CERN">[http://cern-foundation.org/About.aspx?id=136/ "About CERN"], 2012-09-06</ref>  

[http://cern-foundation.org/ The CERN Foundation’s] research is based on a model that includes preclinical evaluation of new and [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved drugs in laboratory models of ependymoma. The drugs are tested in clinical trials involving both pediatric and adult cancer centers from within the CERN network. The CERN Foundation’s research is needed to design better treatment plans for patients with ependymoma.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">Armstrong, TS; Vera-Bolanos, E; Nebiyou Bekele, B; Aldape, K; Gilbert, MR,  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940672/ “Adult ependymal tumors: prognosis and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center experience”], “Neuro-Oncology”, August 2010</ref>

The CERN Foundation differs from other cancer research organizations through its focus on collaborative research and sharing knowledge and available resources among participating researchers.<ref name="About CERN"/>

==History==
In November 2006, the concept of creating an international group to develop new treatments for ependymoma was proposed to Mark Gilbert, M.D., Deputy Chairman of [[Neurooncology|Neuro-Oncology]] at [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center|MD Anderson Cancer Center]], during a meeting with an ependymoma survivor.<ref>[http://cern-foundation.org/About.aspx?id=330/ "About CERN, History"], 2012-09-06</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Dr. Gilbert was joined by Richard Gilbertson, M.D., Ph.D. and Amar Gajjar, M.D. of [[St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital]], and Ken Adalpe, M.D. and Terri Armstrong, Ph.D. of the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]]. After the organization created its initial vision and established its leadership, additional partners joined the CERN team. Today, investigators representing many internationally recognized cancer centers are partnered with the CERN Foundation.<ref>[http://cern-foundation.org/Map.aspx?id=150/ "CERN Centers"], 2012-09-06</ref>

On April 19, 2012 the CERN Foundation commemorated the first Ependymoma Awareness Day in [[Houston]] with a mass butterfly release.<ref name=" Ependymoma Awareness Day">[http://cern-foundation.org/Content.aspx?id=1224/ "Ependymoma Awareness Day"], 2012-09-06</ref>

==Mission==
The mission of the CERN Foundation is to develop new treatments for ependymoma, improve the outcomes and care of patients, ultimately leading to a cure.<ref>[http://www.mskcc.org/links?term_node_tid_depth=908 "Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Recommended Links"], 2012-10-08</ref>

===Research Projects===
CERN leads five research projects to discover new treatments for ependymoma.
#'''Clinical Trials''' – CERN Foundation [[clinical trial]]s test the efficacy of novel treatment approaches for ependymoma. This project serves as a testing ground for new diagnostic and drug discoveries made in Projects Two and Three.<ref name="About CERN, Projects and Collaboration">[http://cern-foundation.org/About.aspx?id=426/ "About CERN, Projects and Collaboration"], 2012-09-06</ref> 
#'''Tumor Profiling and Pathology''' – An integrated [[histology]] and [[molecular biology]] grading system is used to improve the accuracy of ependymoma diagnosis and prognostication. This project seeks to improve the accuracy in the diagnosis of ependymoma and develop the necessary tools to create new assays to study patients undergoing treatment in clinical trials.<ref name="About CERN, Projects and Collaboration" /> 
#'''Developmental Therapeutics''' – CERN Foundation screens thousands of novel compounds and known drugs as possible new treatments for pediatric and adult ependymoma. These agents are then evaluated in Project Four as whether to be tested in clinical trials.<ref name="About CERN, Projects and Collaboration" /> 
#'''Tumor Stem Cell Laboratory Models''' – CERN Foundation laboratory scientists seek to understand how normal neural development goes wrong to result in ependymoma. This project provides insights into the origins of ependymoma and leads to new laboratory models for understanding disease biology and treatment.<ref name="About CERN, Projects and Collaboration" /> 
#'''Patient Outcomes''' – CERN Foundation investigators explore ependymoma [[epidemiology]] and the impact on patient function and quality of life with the goal to develop and disseminate information about ependymoma to patients and medical professionals across the world. The project also provides insights into the design of CERN’s future clinical trials, and all CERN trials include evaluation of the impact of the treatment on the patient.<ref name="About CERN, Projects and Collaboration" />
