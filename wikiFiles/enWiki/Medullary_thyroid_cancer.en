'''Medullary thyroid cancer''' ('''MTC''') is a form of [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid carcinoma]] which originates from the [[parafollicular cell]]s (C cells), which produce the hormone [[calcitonin]].<ref name=hu>Hu MI, Vassilopoulou-Sellin R, Lustig R, Lamont JP. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter05/article/10165/1402668 "Thyroid and Parathyroid Cancers"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref>
Medullary tumors are the third most common of all thyroid cancers. They make up about 3% of all thyroid cancer cases.

Approximately 25% of medullary thyroid cancer is genetic in nature, caused by a mutation in the [[RET proto-oncogene]].  This form is classified as familial MTC. When MTC occurs by itself it is termed sporadic MTC.  When it coexists with tumors of the parathyroid gland and medullary component of the adrenal glands ([[pheochromocytoma]]) it is called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 ([[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2|MEN2]]).

It was first characterized in 1959.<ref name="pmid17555398">{{cite journal |author=Dionigi G, Bianchi V, Rovera F, ''et al.'' |title=Medullary thyroid carcinoma: surgical treatment advances |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=877–85 |year=2007 |pmid=17555398 |doi=10.1586/14737140.7.6.877}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Medulaeres SD-Ca mit Verkalkungen.jpg|thumb|right|Medullary thyroid carcinoma on ultrasound with typical small calcifications (arrows)]]

The major clinical symptom of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma is [[diarrhea]]; occasionally a patient will have [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] episodes.  Both occur particularly with [[liver]] [[metastasis]], and either symptom may be the first manifestation of the disease.  The flushing that occurs in medullary thyroid carcinoma is indistinguishable from that associated with [[carcinoid]] syndrome.  In MTC, the flushing, diarrhea, and itching (pruritis) are all caused by elevated levels of [[calcitonin]] gene products (calcitonin or [[calcitonin gene-related peptide]]).<ref name=Cecil />  Alternatively, the flushing and diarrhea observed in carcinoid syndrome is caused by elevated levels of circulating serotonin.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma may also produce a thyroid nodule and enlarged cervical lymph nodes.<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|year=2011|pages=e76|edition=24th}}</ref>

Sites of spread of medullary thyroid carcinoma include local [[lymph nodes]] in the neck, lymph nodes in the central portion of the chest ([[mediastinum]]), liver, lung, and bone. Spread to other sites such as skin or brain occurs but is uncommon.

==Markers==
While the increased serum concentration of calcitonin is not harmful, it is useful as a marker which can be tested in [[blood test|blood]].<ref name="pmid17982960">{{cite journal |author=Fragu P |title=Calcitonin's fantastic voyage: from hormone to marker of a genetic disorder |journal=Gesnerus |volume=64 |issue=1–2 |pages=69–92 |year=2007 |pmid=17982960 |doi=}}</ref>

A second marker, [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), also produced by medullary thyroid carcinoma, is released into the blood and it is useful as a [[Blood serum|serum]] or blood [[tumor marker]]. In general, measurement of serum CEA is less sensitive than serum calcitonin for detecting the presence of a tumor, but has less minute to minute variability and is therefore useful as an indicator of tumor mass.

==Genetics==
Mutations (DNA changes) in the [[RET proto-oncogene]], located on chromosome 10, lead to the [[gene expression|expression]] of a mutated [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of [[hyperparathyroidism]] and [[pheochromocytoma]]. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50/50 probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.

Seventy-five percent of medullary thyroid carcinoma occurs in individuals without an identifiable family history and is assigned the term "sporadic". Individuals who develop sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma tend to be older and have more extensive disease at the time of initial presentation than those with a family history  (screening is likely to be initiated at an early age in the hereditary form). Approximately 25-60% of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas have a somatic mutation (one that occurs within a single "parafollicular" cell) of the RET proto-oncogene. This mutation is presumed to be the initiating event, although there could be other as yet unidentified causes.

==Treatment==
Extensive surgery can be effective when the condition is detected early, but a risk for recurrence remains.<ref name=hu/><ref name="pmid18084343">{{cite journal |author=Schlumberger M, Carlomagno F, Baudin E, Bidart JM, Santoro M |title=New therapeutic approaches to treat medullary thyroid carcinoma |journal=Nat Clin Pract Endocrinol Metab |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=22–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18084343 |doi=10.1038/ncpendmet0717}}</ref>  About half of patients have metastasis to regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.<ref name=Cecil />

Unlike other differentiated thyroid carcinoma, there is no role for [[radioiodine]] treatment in medullary-type disease.<ref name="pmid15719378">{{cite journal |author=Quayle FJ, Moley JF |title=Medullary thyroid carcinoma: including MEN 2A and MEN 2B syndromes |journal=J Surg Oncol |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=122–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15719378 |doi=10.1002/jso.20184}}</ref>

[[External beam radiotherapy]] should be considered for patients at high risk of regional recurrence, even after optimum surgical treatment. A retrospective study in 1996 found that external beam radiation was beneficial in some patients.<ref name="pmid8875751">{{cite journal |author=Brierley J, Tsang R, Simpson WJ, Gospodarowicz M, Sutcliffe S, Panzarella T |title=Medullary thyroid cancer: analyses of survival and prognostic factors and the role of radiation therapy in local control |journal=Thyroid |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=305–10 |year=1996 |pmid=8875751 |doi=10.1089/thy.1996.6.305}}</ref>

===Drugs===
After a long period during which surgery and radiation therapy formed the major treatments for medullary thyroid carcinoma, clinical trials of several new [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]]s were running in 2007.<ref name="titleAmerican Thyroid Association - Thyroid Clinical Trials">{{cite web |url=http://www.thyroidtrials.org |title=American Thyroid Association - Thyroid Clinical Trials |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format= |work=}}</ref> Preliminary results show clear evidence of response in 10-30% of patients. In the majority of responders there has been less than a 30% decrease in tumor mass, yet the responses have been durable; responses have been stable for periods exceeding 3 years. The major side effects of this class of drug include hypertension, nausea, diarrhea, some cardiac electrical abnormalities, and thrombotic or bleeding episodes.

In April 2011 [[Vandetanib]] became the first drug to be approved by US FDA for treatment of late-stage (metastatic) medullary thyroid cancer in adult patients who are ineligible for surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm250168.htm|title=FDA approves new treatment for rare form of thyroid cancer|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref>

In October 2011, [[Cabozantinib]] met its primary endpoint in a [[phases of clinical research|phase 3]] trial (EXAM) conducted by [[Exelixis]] investigating its effect on [[progression-free survival]] for patients with medullary thyroid cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exelixis.com/node/215|title=Success for the EXAM trial|accessdate= 24 October 2011}}</ref> A [[new drug application]] was submitted in the first half of 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/news.showNewsArticle/id/13/news_id/3299|title=Thyroid cancer drug cabozantinib prolongs PFS|accessdate= 24 October 2011}}</ref> and on November 29, 2012, Cabozantinib was granted marketing approval by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) under the name [[Cometriq]] for this indication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm330143.htm|title=FDA approves Cometriq to treat rare type of thyroid cancer|accessdate= 29 November 2012}}</ref> Cometriq works by blocking abnormal kinase proteins involved in the development and growth of medullary cancer cells.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of MTC is poorer than that of follicular and papillary thyroid cancer when it has metastasized (spread) beyond the thyroid gland. Depending on source, the overall [[5-year survival rate]] for medullary thyroid cancer is 80%,<ref name=american/> 83%<ref>{{cite doi|10.1210/jc.2005-0044}}</ref> or 86%,<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/thyroid/HealthProfessional/page7 National Cancer Institute > Medullary Thyroid Cancer] Last Modified: 12/22/2010</ref> and the 10-year survival rate is 75%.<ref name=american>Numbers from National Cancer Database in the US, from [http://books.google.se/books?id=u1aFpF-EcgwC&pg=PA10 Page 10] in: {{cite book |author=F.

By overall [[cancer staging]] into stages I to IV, the [[5-year survival rate]] is 100% at [[cancer staging|stage]] I, 98% at stage II, 81% at stage III and 28% at stage IV.<ref name=acc>[http://www.cancer.org/cancer/thyroidcancer/detailedguide/thyroid-cancer-survival-rates cancer.org > Thyroid Cancer] By the American Cancer Society.

The prognostic value of measuring calcitonin and [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA) concentrations in the blood in patients with abnormal calcitonin levels postsurgery has been recently published (2005) in a retrospective study of 65 MTC patients; see Barbet, ''et al.''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbet J, Campion L, Kraeber-Bodéré F, Chatal JF |title=Prognostic impact of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen doubling-times in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=6077–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16091497 |doi=10.1210/jc.2005-0044 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16091497}}</ref>  The post-surgical times ranged from 2.9 years to 29.5 years; all 65 patients '''continued''' to have abnormal calcitonin levels after total thyroidectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection.  The prognosis of surviving MTC appears to be correlated with the rate at which a patient's postoperative calcitonin concentration doubles, rather than the pre- or postoperative absolute calcitonin level.

The result of the 65 patient study can be summarized with respect to the calcitonin doubling time (CDT):

'''CDT < 6 months:'''  3 patients out of 12 (25%) survived 5 years.  1 patient out of 12 (8%) survived 10 years. All died within 6 months to 13.3 years.

'''CDT between 6 months and 2 years:'''  11 patients out of 12 (92%) survived 5 years.  3 patients out of 8 (37%) survived 10 years.  4 patients out of 12 (25%) survived to the end of the study.

'''CDT > 2 years:''' 41 patients out of 41 (100%) were alive at the end of the study.  These included 1 patient whose calcitonin was stable, and 11 patients who had decreasing calcitonin levels.

The 65 patients had a median age of 51 (range was 6 to 75), with 24 age 45 years or younger and 41 older than 45 years.  The gender representation was 31 males and 34 females.  All patients shared the following characteristics: 1) had total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection; 2) had non-zero calcitonin levels after surgery; 3) had at least 4 serum [[calcitonin]] measurements after surgery; 4) had a status that could be confirmed at the conclusion of the study.

The same study noted that [[calcitonin]] doubling time is a statistically better predictor of MTC survival, compared with [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|CEA]].
