'''Gastrulation''' is a phase early in the [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] of most [[animals]], during which the single-layered [[blastula]] is reorganized into a trilaminar ("three-layered") structure known as the '''gastrula'''. These three ''[[germ layers]]'' are known as the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Mundlos, Stefan|chapter=Gene action: developmental genetics|editors=Speicher, Michael et al.|title=Vogel and Motulsky's Human Genetics: Problems and Approaches|edition=4th|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-540-37653-8|page=422|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FlfPSpBvKLgC&pg=PA422}}</ref><ref name="mcgeady-2004-p.34">McGeady, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=n4C0TUeR7mUC&pg=PA34 p. 34]</ref>

Gastrulation takes place after [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] and the formation of the [[blastula]] and [[primitive streak]]. Gastrulation is followed by [[organogenesis]], when individual organs develop within the newly formed germ layers.<ref>Hall, 1998: [http://books.google.com/books?id=JhSwumfgTQ4C&pg=PA132 pp. 132-134]</ref> Each layer gives rise to specific [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organs]] in the developing embryo. The '''ectoderm''' gives rise to [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], and to the [[neural crest]] and other tissues that will later form the [[nervous system]]. The '''mesoderm''' is found between the ectoderm and the endoderm and gives rise to [[somites]], which form [[muscle]]; the [[cartilage]] of the [[ribs]] and [[vertebrae]]; the [[dermis]], the [[notochord]], [[blood]] and [[blood vessels]], [[bone]], and [[connective tissue]]. The '''endoderm''' gives rise to the [[epithelium]] of the [[digestive system]] and [[respiratory system]], and organs associated with the [[digestive system]], such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]].<ref name=Arnold>{{cite journal|author=Arnold, S.J. & Robertson, E.J.|title=Making a commitment: cell lineage allocation and axis patterning in the early mouse embryo|journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol|volume=10|issue=2|pages=91–103|year=2009|pmid=19129791|doi=10.1038/nrm2618}}</ref> Following gastrulation, cells in the body are either organized into sheets of connected cells (as in [[epithelia]]), or as a mesh of isolated cells, such as [[mesenchyme]].<ref name="mcgeady-2004-p.34" /><ref>Hall, 1998: [http://books.google.com/books?id=JhSwumfgTQ4C&pg=PA177 p. 177]</ref>

The molecular mechanism and timing of gastrulation is different in different organisms. However, some common features of gastrulation across [[Triploblasty|triploblastic]] organisms include: (1) A change in the [[topological structure]] of the embryo, from a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] surface ([[sphere]]-like), to a non-simply connected surface ([[torus]]-like); (2) the [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] of cells into one of three types (endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal); and (3) the [[digestive]] function of a large number of endodermal cells.<ref>{{cite book|author=Harrison, Lionel G.|title=The Shaping of Life: The Generation of Biological Pattern|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-521-55350-6|page=206|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-IPG-vg7Pr8C&pg=PA206}}</ref>

[[Lewis Wolpert]], pioneering developmental biologist in the field, has been credited for noting that "It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation, which is truly the most important time in your life."

The terms "[[gastrula]]" and "gastrulation" were coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], in his 1872 work ''"Biology of Calcareous Sponges"''.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ereskovsky, Alexander V.|title=The Comparative Embryology of Sponges|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8574-0|page=236|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PHztG3LEUnsC&pg=PA236}}</ref>

Although gastrulation patterns exhibit enormous variation throughout the animal kingdom, they are unified by the five basic types of cell movements that occur during gastrulation. 1)[[Invagination]] 2) [[Involution]] 3) [[Ingression]] 4) [[Delamination]] 5) [[Epiboly]]. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Gilbert, Scott F.|title=Developmental Biology Ninth Edition|publisher=Sinauer Associates|year=2010|isbn=978-0-87893-558-1|page=164}}</ref>

==In amniotes==

===Overview===
In [[amniotes]], gastrulation occurs in the following sequence: (1) the [[embryo]] becomes [[asymmetry|asymmetric]]; (2) the [[primitive streak]] forms; (3) cells from the [[epiblast]] at the [[primitive streak]] undergo an [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition|epithelial to mesenchymal transition]] and [[ingression (biology)|ingress]] at the [[primitive streak]] to form the [[germ layers]].<ref name=Arnold />

===Loss of symmetry===
In preparation for gastrulation, the embryo must become asymmetric along both the [[Proximo-distal|proximal-distal axis]] and the [[Anteroposterior|anterior-posterior axis]].  The proximal-distal axis is formed when the cells of the embryo form the “egg cylinder,” which consists of the extraembryonic tissues, which give rise to structures like the [[placenta]], at the proximal end and the [[epiblast]] at the distal end.  Many signaling pathways contribute to this reorganization, including [[bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]], [[fibroblast growth factor|FGF]], [[nodal signaling|nodal]], and [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]].  Visceral endoderm surrounds the [[epiblast]].  The [[distal]] visceral endoderm (DVE) migrates to the [[anterior]] portion of the embryo, forming the “anterior visceral endoderm” (AVE).  This breaks anterior-posterior symmetry and is regulated by [[NODAL|nodal]] signaling.<ref name=Arnold />

===Formation of the primitive streak===
The [[primitive streak]] is formed at the beginning of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the [[epiblast]] on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of [[ingression (biology)|ingression]].<ref name= Tam>{{cite journal|author=Tam, P.L. & Behringer, R.R.| title = Mouse gastrulation: the formation of a mammalian body plan | journal =Mech Dev |volume = 68 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 3–25 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9431800| doi = 10.1016/S0925-4773(97)00123-8}}</ref>  Formation of the [[primitive streak]] is reliant upon [[NODAL|nodal]] signaling<ref name=Arnold /> within the cells contributing to the primitive streak and [[BMP4]] signaling from the extraembryonic tissue.<ref name=Tam /><ref>{{cite book|author=Catala, M.|chapter=Cell Movements During Gastrulation|editors=Tortori-Donati, Paolo et al.|title=Pediatric Neuroradiology: Brain|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=978-3-540-41077-5|page=1535|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RJvkR3gfExwC&pg=PA1535}}</ref>  Furthermore, [[Cerberus (protein)|Cer1]] and [[Lefty (protein)|Lefty1]] restrict the primitive streak to the appropriate location by antagonizing [[NODAL|nodal]] signaling.<ref name=Loebel>{{cite journal | author = Tam, P.P. & Loebel, D.A|title=Gene function in mouse embryogenesis: get set for gastrulation | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 368–81 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17387317 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2084}}</ref>  The region defined as the [[primitive streak]] continues to grow towards the distal tip.<ref name=Arnold />

During the early stages of development, the primitive streak is the structure that will establish [[bilateral symmetry]], determine the site of gastrulation and initiate germ layer formation. To form the streak, reptiles, birds and mammals arrange mesenchymal cells along the prospective midline, establishing the first embryonic axis, as well as the place where cells will ingress and migrate during  the process of gastrulation and germ layer formation.<ref name="mikawa">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/dvdy.10458 |author= Mikawa T, Poh AM, Kelly KA, Ishii Y, Reese DE. |title= Induction and patterning of the primitive streak, an organizing center of gastrulation in the amniote. |journal= Dev Dyn |volume=229 |pages= 422–32|year=2004 |pmid=14991697| issue=3}}</ref> The primitive streak, extends through this midline and creates the antero-posterior body axis,<ref name="downs">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/bies.200900038 |author= Downs KM. |title= The enigmatic primitive streak: prevailing notions and challenges concerning the body axis of mammals. |journal= Bioessays |volume=31 |pages= 892–902|year=2009|pmid=19609969| issue=8 |pmc= 2949267}}</ref> becoming the first symmetry-breaking event in the [[embryo]], and marks the beginning of gastrulation.<ref name="chuai">{{cite journal |author= Chuai M, Zeng W, Yang X, Boychenko V, Glazier JA, Weijer CJ. |title= Cell movement during chick primitive streak formation. |journal= Dev Biol. |volume= 296(1)) |issue= 1 |pages= 137–49. |year=2006 |pmid=16725136 |pmc= 2556955 |doi= 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.04.451}}</ref> This process involves the ingression of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors and their migration to their ultimate position,<ref name="downs"/><ref name="chuai M">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0070-2153(07)81004-0 |author= Chuai M, Weijer CJ. |title= The mechanisms underlying primitive streak formation in the chick embryo. |journal= Curr Top Dev Biol. |volume= 81 |pages= 135–56. |year=2008 |pmid=18023726}}</ref> where they will differentiate  into the three germ layers.<ref name="mikawa">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/dvdy.10458 |author= Mikawa T, Poh AM, Kelly KA, Ishii Y, Reese DE. |title= Induction and patterning of the primitive streak, an organizing center of gastrulation in the [[amniote]]. |journal= Dev Dyn |volume=229 |pages= 422–32|year=2004 |pmid=14991697| issue=3}}</ref> The localization of the cell adhesion and signaling molecule [[beta-catenin]] is critical to the proper formation of the organizer region that is responsible for initiating gastrulation.

===Epithelial to mesenchymal transition and ingression===
In order for the cells to move from the [[epithelium]] of the [[epiblast]] through the [[primitive streak]] to form a new layer, the cells must undergo an [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition|epithelial to mesenchymal transition]] (EMT) to lose their epithelial characteristics, such as [[Cell adhesion|cell-cell adhesion]].  [[fibroblast growth factor|FGF]] signaling is necessary for proper EMT.  [[FGFR1]] is needed for the up regulation of [[Snail1]], which down regulates [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherin]], causing a loss of cell adhesion.  Following the EMT, the cells [[ingression (biology)|ingress]] through the [[primitive streak]] and spread out to form a new layer of cells or join existing layers.  [[FGF8]] is implicated in the process of this dispersal from the [[primitive streak]].<ref name=Loebel />
