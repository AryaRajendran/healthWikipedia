<!-- symptoms/signs/diagnosis -->
The trigeminal nerve is a paired [[cranial nerve]] that has three major branches: the [[ophthalmic nerve]] (V<sub>1</sub>), the [[maxillary nerve]] (V<sub>2</sub>), and the [[mandibular nerve]] (V<sub>3</sub>). One, two, or all three branches of the nerve may be affected. 10-12% of cases are bilateral (occurring on both the left and right sides of the face). Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the [[maxillary nerve]] or V<sub>2</sub>) and lower branch ([[mandibular nerve]] or V<sub>3</sub>) of the trigeminal nerve,<ref>[http://www.neurosurgery.ufl.edu/clinical-specialties/images/trigeminal_neuralgia_brochure_for_web.pdf Trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm] by UF&Shands - The University of Florida Health System. Retrieved Mars 2012</ref> but the pain may be felt in the ear, eye, lips, nose, scalp, forehead, cheeks, teeth, or jaw and side of the face.

<!-- management -->
TN is not easily controlled but can be managed with a variety of treatment options.<ref name=Sarmah2008>Satta Sarmah (2008). "Nerve disorder's pain so bad it's called the 'suicide disease'". ''Medill Reports Chicago''. http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=79817</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
This disorder is characterized by episodes of intense facial pain that last from a few seconds to several minutes or hours. The episodes of intense pain may occur [[paroxysm]]ally. To describe the pain sensation, patients may describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode; however, in many patients the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation. It affects lifestyle as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving and brushing teeth. Wind, high pitched sounds, loud noises such as concerts or crowds, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said by those affected to feel like stabbing [[electric shock]]s, burning, pressing, crushing, exploding or shooting pain that becomes intractable. 

Individual attacks usually affect one side of the face at a time, lasting from several seconds to a few minutes and repeat up to hundreds of times throughout the day. The pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. 10-12% of cases are bilateral, or occurring on both sides. This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves since one serves strictly the left side of the face and the other serves the right side. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time, in some patients. Many patients develop the pain in one branch, then over years the pain will travel through the other nerve branches. Some patients also experience pain in the index finger.<ref name=Bayer1979>{{cite journal|author=Bayer DB, Stenger TG|title=Trigeminal neuralgia: an overview|journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol|volume=48|issue=5|pages=393–9|year=1979|pmid=226915|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(79)90064-1}}</ref>

It may slowly spread to involve more extensive portions of the trigeminal nerve. The spread may even affect all divisions of the nerve, and sometimes simultaneously. Cases with bilateral involvement have not indicated simultaneous activity. The following suggest a systemic development: rapid spreading, bilateral involvement, or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks. Examples of systemic involvement include multiple sclerosis or expanding cranial tumor. Examples of simultaneous involvement include ''tic convulsive'' (of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves) and occurrence of symptoms in the fifth and ninth cranial nerve areas.<ref name="Okeson 2005 453">{{cite book|last=Okeson|first=JP|title=Bell's orofacial pains: the clinical management of orofacial pain|year=2005|publisher=Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc|isbn=0-86715-439-X|page=453|url=http://www.quintpub.com/display_detail.php3?psku=B439X|editor=Lindsay Harmon|chapter=17}}</ref> 

Outwardly visible signs of TN can sometimes be seen in males who may deliberately miss an area of their face when shaving, in order to avoid triggering an episode. Successive recurrences are incapacitating and the dread of provoking an attack may make sufferers unable to engage in normal daily activities.
 
There is also a variant of TN called [[atypical trigeminal neuralgia]] (also referred to as "trigeminal neuralgia, type 2"),<ref name=OHSU>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/facialpain/facial_pain-dx.shtml|title=Neurological surgery: facial pain|publisher=Oregon Health & Science University|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref> based on a recent classification of facial pain.<ref name=Burchiel2003>{{cite journal|author=Burchiel KJ|title=A new classification for facial pain|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1164–7|year=2003|pmid=14580284|doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000088806.11659.D8|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-396X&volume=53&issue=5&spage=1164}}</ref> In some cases of atypical TN the sufferer experiences a severe, relentless underlying pain similar to a migraine in addition to the stabbing shock-like pains. In other cases, the pain is stabbing and intense but may feel like burning or prickling, rather than a shock. Sometimes the pain is a combination of shock-like sensations, [[migraine]]-like pain, and burning or prickling pain. It can also manifest as an unrelenting, boring, piercing pain.

==Causes==
The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as [[tactition]] (pressure), [[thermoception]] (temperature), and [[nociception]] (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the [[Mastication#Muscles of mastication|muscles of mastication]], the muscles involved in chewing but not facial expression. 

Several theories exist to explain the possible causes of this [[pain]] syndrome. It was once believed that the nerve was compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but newer leading research indicates that it is an enlarged blood vessel - possibly the [[superior cerebellar artery]] - compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons. Such a compression can injure the nerve's protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve. This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve as well as hinder the nerve's ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends. This type of injury may rarely be caused by an [[aneurysm]] (an outpouching of a [[blood vessel]]); by a [[tumor]]; by an [[arachnoid cyst]] in the [[cerebellopontine angle]];<ref name=Babu1991>{{cite journal|author=Babu R, Murali R|title=Arachnoid cyst of the cerebellopontine angle manifesting as contralateral trigeminal neuralgia: case report|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=28|issue=6|pages=886–7|year=1991|pmid=2067614|doi=10.1097/00006123-199106000-00018|url=}}</ref> or by a traumatic event such as a car accident.

Short-term peripheral compression is often painless, with pain attacks lasting no more than a few seconds.<ref name="Okeson 2005 114"/> Persistent compression results in local demyelination with no loss of axon potential continuity. Chronic nerve entrapment results in demyelination primarily, with progressive axonal degeneration subsequently.<ref name="Okeson 2005 114"/> It is, "therefore widely accepted that trigeminal neuralgia is associated with demyelination of axons in the [[Gasserian ganglion]], the dorsal root, or both."<ref name="Okeson 2005 115">{{cite book|last=Okeson|first=JP|title=Bell's orofacial pains: the clinical management of orofacial pain|year=2005|publisher=Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc|isbn=0-86715-439-X|page=115|url=http://www.quintpub.com/display_detail.php3?psku=B439X|editor=Lindsay Harmon|chapter=6}}</ref> It has been suggested that this compression may be related to an aberrant branch of the superior cerebellar artery that lies on the trigeminal nerve.<ref name="Okeson 2005 115"/> Further causes, besides an aneurysm, multiple sclerosis or cerebellopontine angle tumor, include: a posterior fossa tumor, any other expanding lesion or even brainstem diseases from strokes.<ref name="Okeson 2005 115"/>

A large portion of multiple sclerosis patients have TN, but is not a symptom of MS. Only two to four percent of patients with TN,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} usually younger,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} have evidence of [[multiple sclerosis]], which may damage either the trigeminal nerve or other related parts of the brain. It has been theorized that this is due to damage to the [[spinal trigeminal complex]].<ref name=Cruccu2009>{{cite journal|author=Cruccu G|title=Trigeminal neuralgia and pain related to multiple sclerosis|journal=Pain|volume=143|issue=3|pages=186–91|year=2009|pmid=19171430|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2008.12.026|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304-3959(08)00760-4|author-separator=,|author2=Biasiotta A|author3=Di Rezze S|display-authors=3|last4=Fiorelli|first4=M|last5=Galeotti|first5=F|last6=Innocenti|first6=P|last7=Mameli|first7=S|last8=Millefiorini|first8=E|last9=Truini|first9=A.}}</ref> Trigeminal pain has a similar presentation in patients with and without MS.<ref name=Simone2005>{{cite journal|author=De Simone R|title=A clinical comparison of trigeminal neuralgic pain in patients with and without underlying multiple sclerosis|journal=Neurol Sci|volume=26 Suppl 2|issue=|pages=s150–1|year=2005|pmid=15926016|doi=10.1007/s10072-005-0431-8|author-separator=,|author2=Marano E|author3=Brescia MV|display-authors=3|last4=Ranieri|first4=A|last5=Ripa|first5=P|last6=Esposito|first6=M|last7=Vacca|first7=G|last8=Bonavita|first8=V.}}</ref>

[[Postherpetic neuralgia]], which occurs after [[shingles]], may cause similar symptoms if the trigeminal nerve is damaged.

When there is no [apparent] structural cause, the syndrome is called [[idiopathic]].

==Management==
As with many conditions without clear physical or laboratory diagnosis, TN is sometimes misdiagnosed. A TN sufferer will sometimes seek the help of numerous clinicians before a firm diagnosis is made. 

There is evidence that points towards the need to quickly treat and diagnose TN. It is thought that the longer a patient suffers from TN, the harder it may be to reverse the neural pathways associated with the pain. 

The dentist must ensure a correct diagnosis does not mistake TN as a [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|temporomandibular disorder]].<ref name=Drangsholt2001>{{cite journal|last=Drangsholt|first=M|last2=Truelove|first2=EL|title=Trigeminal neuralgia mistaken as temporomandibular disorder|journal=J Evid Base Dent Pract|year=2001|volume=1|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.1067/med.2001.116846|url=http://www.jebdp.com/article/S1532-3382%2801%2970082-6/abstract}}</ref> Since triggering may be caused by movements of the tongue or facial muscles, TN must be differentiated from masticatory pain that has the clinical characteristics of deep somatic rather than neuropathic pain. Masticatory pain will not be arrested by a conventional mandibular local anesthetic block.<ref name="Okeson 2005 453"/>

Dentists who suspect TN should proceed in the most conservative manner possible and should ensure that all tooth structures are "truly" compromised before performing extractions or other procedures.

Three other procedures use needles or catheters that enter through the face into the opening where the nerve first splits into its three divisions. Some excellent success rates using a cost-effective [[percutaneous]] surgical procedure known as ''balloon compression'' have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Natarajan|first=M|title=Percutaneous trigeminal ganglion balloon compression: experience in 40 patients|journal=Neurology (Neurological Society of India)|year=2000|volume=48|issue=4|pages=330–2|pmid=11146595}}</ref> This technique has been helpful in treating the elderly for whom surgery may not be an option due to coexisting health conditions. Balloon compression is also the best choice for patients who have [[ophthalmic nerve]] pain or have experienced recurrent pain after [[microvascular decompression]].

Glycerol injections involve injecting an alcohol-like substance into the cavern that bathes the nerve near its junction. This liquid is corrosive to the nerve fibers and can mildly injure the nerve enough to hinder the errant pain signals. In a radiofrequency rhizotomy, the surgeon uses an electrode to heat the selected division or divisions of the nerve. Done well, this procedure can target the exact regions of the errant pain triggers and disable them with minimal numbness.
