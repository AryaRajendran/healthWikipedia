'''Prepatellar bursitis''' (also known as '''beat knee''',<ref name="Wilson"/> '''carpet layer's knee''', '''coal miner's knee''', '''housemaid's knee'''<ref name="Greenberg"/> '''rug cutter's knee''', or '''nun's knee''') <ref>http://www.icd9data.com/2012/Volume1/710-739/725-729/727/727.2.htm</ref> is an inflammation of the [[prepatellar bursa]] at the front of the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's [[range of motion]]. It is most commonly caused by [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] to the knee, either by a single [[acute (medicine)|acute]] instance or by [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.

A definitive diagnosis of the condition can usually be made once a [[clinical history]] and [[physical examination]] have been obtained, though determining whether or not the bursitis is [[sepsis|septic]] is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and [[Cryotherapy|icing]] of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including [[intravenous]] antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and [[bursectomy]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Prepatellar bursa.png|thumb|Lateral section of the knee.]]
The primary symptom of prepatellar bursitis is the swelling of the area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling.<ref name="Biundo">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases | editor = Klippel, John H | title = Prepatellar Bursitis | year = 2008 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 9780387356648 | page = 80 | author = Biundo, Joseph J | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=3zM9yCy8uqUC&pg=PA80 }}</ref> The area of swelling may be red ([[erythema]]), warm to the touch, or surrounded by [[cellulitis]], particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by [[fever]].<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 608}} Unlike [[arthritis]], prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the [[range of motion]] of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely [[flexion|flexed]].<ref name="Aaron">{{cite journal | title = Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management | author = Aaron, DL ''et al''. | journal = J Am Acad Orthop Surg | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 359–361 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21628647 }}</ref>{{rp|p. 360}} Flexion and extension of the knee may cause [[crepitus]].<ref name="Price">{{cite journal | title = Prepatellar bursitis | author = Price, N | journal = Emergency Nurse| date = June 2008 | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 20–24 | pmid = 18672851 }}</ref>{{rp|p. 20}}

== Causes ==
In human [[anatomy]], a ''[[Synovial bursa|bursa]]'' is a small pouch filled with [[synovial fluid]]. Its purpose is to reduce [[friction]] between adjacent structures. The [[prepatellar bursa]] is one of several [[bursae of the knee joint]], and is located between the [[patella]] and the skin.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Bursae around the knee joints | author = Chatra, Priyank | journal = Ind J Radiol Imag | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | date = January–March 2012 | page = 27 | pmid = 22623812 | doi=10.4103/0971-3026.95400 | pmc=3354353}}</ref> Prepatellar bursitis is an [[inflammation]] of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin.<ref name="Price"/>{{rp|p. 22}} Along with the [[pes anserine bursitis|pes anserine bursa]], the prepatellar bursa is one of the most common bursae to cause [[knee pain]] when inflamed.<ref name="AcuteKneePain">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2010 | editor = McPhee, SJ and Papadakis, MA | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | year = 2010 | location = New York | author = Gonzales, R and Nadler, PL | title = Acute Knee Pain | page = 33 | issn = 0092-8682 }}</ref> 

Prepatellar bursitis is caused by either a single instance of acute [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause [[extravasation]] of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] response.<ref name="Greenberg">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Greenberg's Text-Atlas of Emergency Medicine | editor = Greenberg, Michael I | title = Prepatellar Bursitis | author = Madsen, James M | page = 922 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tjZttRRH8H8C&pg=PA922 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | date = 22 November 2004 | isbn = 9780781745864 }}</ref> This response occurs in two phases: The [[vascular]] phase, in which the blood flow to the surrounding area increases, and the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] phase, in which [[leukocytes]] migrate from the blood to the affected area.<ref name="Price"/>{{rp|p. 22}} Other possible causes include [[gout]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[CREST syndrome]],<ref name="Aaron"/>{{rp|p. 359}} [[diabetes mellitus]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[uremia]], and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].<ref name="Price"/>{{rp|p. 22}} Some cases are [[idiopathic]], though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.<ref name = "McAfee">{{cite journal | title = Olecranon and prepatellar bursitis—Diagnosis and treatment | author = McAfee, JH and Smith, DL | journal = West J Med | date = November 1988 | volume = 149 | issue = 5 | pages = 607–610 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1026560/pdf/westjmed00135-0105.pdf | pmc=1026560 | pmid=3074561}}</ref>{{rp|pp. 607–8}}  

The prepatellar bursa and the [[olecranon bursa]] are the two bursae that are most likely to become infected, or ''[[sepsis|septic]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2010 | editor = McPhee, SJ and Papadakis, MA | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | year = 2010 | location = New York | author = Hellmann, DB and Imboden, JB | title = Bursitis | page = 743 | issn = 0092-8682 }}</ref> Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]], though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by [[bacteria]] traveling through the blood from an pre-existing infection site.<ref name="MedNet">{{cite web | title = Bursitis of the Knee | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/knee_bursitis/article.htm | author = Shiel, William C | accessdate = 9 May 2012 | publisher = MedicineNet }}</ref> In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''; other common infections are ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium]]'', and ''[[Brucella]]''.<ref name="Aaron"/>{{rp|p. 359}} It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by [[anaerobe]]s, [[fungi]], or [[Gram-negative bacteria]].<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 608}} In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Schick">{{cite journal | journal = Clin Orthop Relat Res | date = September 1990 | volume = 258 | pages = 209–212 | title = Mycobacterial prepatellar bursitis | author = Schickendantz, MS and Watson, JT | pmid = 2203571 | issue=258}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
There are several types of inflammation that can cause [[knee pain]], including [[sprain]]s, bursitis, and injuries to the [[meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]].<ref name="AcuteKneePain"/> A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a [[physical examination]] and the presence of [[risk factor]]s in the person's [[medical history]]; swelling and tenderness at the front of the knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis.<ref name="Greenberg"/> Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate [[arthritis]] instead.<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 608}}

A physical examination and medical history are generally not enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; [[Fine-needle aspiration|aspiration]] of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a [[cell culture]] and [[Gram stain]] of the aspirated fluid.<ref name="Aaron"/>{{rp|p. 360}} Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is found to have a [[neutrophil]] count above 1500 per [[microliter]],<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 608}} a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter).<ref name="Aaron"/>{{rp|p. 360}} A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a [[roentgenogram]] and [[urinalysis]].<ref name="Schick"/>

== Prevention ==
It is possible to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent kneeling.<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 610}} Protective [[knee pad]]s can also help prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play [[contact sports]], such as [[American football]], [[basketball]], and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]].<ref name="Ortho"/>

==Treatment==
Non-septic prepatellar bursitis can be treated with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and [[anti-inflammatory drug]]s, particularly [[ibuprofen]]. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process.<ref name="Ortho">{{cite web | title = Prepatellar (Kneecap) Bursitis | url = http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00338 | publisher = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons | date = July 2007 | accessdate = 10 May 2012 }}</ref> Severe cases may require [[fine-needle aspiration]] of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with [[cortisone]] injections.<ref name="MedNet"/> However, some studies have shown that [[steroid]] injections may not be an effective treatment option.<ref name="Mysnyk">{{cite journal| title = Prepatellar bursitis in wrestlers | author = Mysnyk, MC ''et al''. | journal = Am J Sports Med | date = January 1986 | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–54 | doi  = 10.1177/036354658601400109}}</ref> After the bursitis has been treated, [[Physical therapy|rehabilitative exercise]] may help improve joint mechanics and reduce [[chronic pain]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Lower extremity bursitis | journal = Am Fam Physician | date = 15 May 1996 | volume = 53 | issue = 7 | author = Butcher JD ''et al''. | pmid = 8638508 | pages=2317–24}}</ref>{{rp|p. 2320}}

Opinions vary as to which treatment options are most effective for septic prepatellar bursitis.<ref name="Aaron"/>{{rp|p. 360}} McAfee and Smith recommend a course of [[oral antibiotics]], usually [[oxacillin sodium]] or [[cephradine]], and assert that surgery and drainage are unnecessary.<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 609}} Wilson-MacDonald argues that oral antibiotics are "inadequate", and recommends [[intravenous]] antibiotics for managing the infection.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite journal | title = Management and outcome of infective prepatellar bursitis | author = Wilson-Macdonald, James | journal = Postgrad Med J | volume = 63 | issue = 744 | pages = 851–853 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.63.744.851 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3447109}}</ref> Some authors suggest [[Therapeutic irrigation|surgical irrigation]] of the bursa by means of a [[subcutaneous]] tube.<ref name="Aaron"/>{{rp|p. 360}}<ref>{{cite journal | title = Treating septic prepatellar bursitis | author = Hennrikus, WL ''et al''. | journal = West J Med | volume = 151 | issue = 3 | date = September 1989 | pages = 331–332 | pmc=1026890 | pmid=2627225}}</ref> Others suggest that [[bursectomy]] may be necessary for intractable cases; the operation is an [[outpatient procedure]] that can be performed in less than half an hour.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Endoscopic treatment of prepatellar bursitis | author = Huang, Y and Yeh, W | journal = Int Orthop | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | date = March 2011 | pages = 355–358 | doi = 10.1007/s00264-010-1033-5 }}</ref>{{rp|p. 357}}

== Epidemiology ==
The various nicknames associated with prepatellar bursitis arise from the fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent [[kneeling]], such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers.<ref name="Greenberg"/><ref name="Biundo"/><ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 607}} The exact [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported.<ref name="McAfee"/>{{rp|p. 607}} Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.<ref>{{cite web | title = Prepatellar Bursitis | author = Allen, Kelly L | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/309014-overview#a0199 | date = 18 January 2012 | accessdate = 21 May 2012 | publisher = WebMD}}</ref>
