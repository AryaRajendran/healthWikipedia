'''Intratubular [[germ cell]] [[neoplasia]]''', [[abbreviated]] '''ITGCN''' or '''IGCN''' and also known as '''testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia''' and '''intratubular germ cell neoplasia of the testis''', is considered a precursor lesion for many types of [[testis|testicular]] [[germ cell tumor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bettocchi C, Coker CB, Deacon J, Parkinson C, Pryor JP |title=A review of testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia in infertile men |journal=J. Androl. |volume=15 Suppl |issue= |pages=14S–16S |year=1994 |pmid=7721669 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The common, unspecified variant of the entity was once considered to be a [[carcinoma in situ]]<ref>,{{cite journal |author=Dieckmann KP, Skakkebaek NE |title=Carcinoma in situ of the testis: review of biological and clinical features |journal=Int. J. Cancer |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=815–22 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10597201 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991210)83:6<815::AID-IJC21>3.0.CO;2-Z|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/66502431/abstract}}</ref> although the term "carcinoma ''in situ''" is no longer preferred for ITGCN, unspecified type (ITGCNU) lesions because they are not epithelial lesions.<ref name=Sternberg>Mills, S (ed.) 2009.Sternberg's Diagnostic Pathology. 5th Edition. ISBN 978-0-7817-7942-5</ref>

==Classification==
The [[World Health Organisation]] [[Testicular_cancer#Classification|classification of testicular tumours]]<ref name=WHO>Eble J.N., Sauter G., Epstein J.I., Sesterhenn I.A. (Eds.): World Health Organization Classification of Tumours. Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Urinary System
and Male Genital Organs. IARC Press: Lyon 2004. ISBN 92-832-2412-4</ref> subdivides ITGCN into (1) a more common, '''u'''nspecified type (ITGCNU), and (2) other specific subtypes.  The most common specific subtypes are intratubular [[embryonal carcinoma]] and intratubular [[seminoma]].

==Cancer risk==
ITGCNU is seen in the following settings:<ref name=Sternberg/>
* Almost all invasive germ cell tumours of the testis in adults
* Fifty percent of patients with ITGCNU developed invasive germ cell tumours within five years of initial diagnosis.
*Five percent of [[contralateral]] testes in men with a history of prior testicular germ cell tumour.
*Less than five percent of [[cryptorchid]] testes.
*Less than one percent of patients with infertility.

==Germ cell tumors that do not arise from ITGCNU==
Not all germ cell tumors (GCTs) arise from ''intratubular germ cell neoplasia''. The following testicular GCTs do not arise from ITGCN:
*[[Spermatocytic seminoma]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Müller J, Skakkebaek NE, Parkinson MC |title=The spermatocytic seminoma: views on pathogenesis |journal=Int. J. Androl. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=147–56 |year=1987 |month=February |pmid=3583416 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2605.1987.tb00176.x|url=}}</ref>
*Pediatric [[Yolk sac tumor]]s (endodermal sinus tumour).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Manivel JC, Simonton S, Wold LE, Dehner LP |title=Absence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia in testicular yolk sac tumors in children. A histochemical and immunohistochemical study |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=112 |issue=6 |pages=641–5 |year=1988 |month=June |pmid=2837162 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  This is currently an area of controversy as some authors dispute the absence of ITGCN in these cases.<ref name=Sternberg/>
*[[Teratoma]] (rare exceptions)<ref name=Sternberg/>

==Diagnosis==
ITGCN is not palpable, and not visible on macroscopic examination of testicular tissue.  Microscopic examination of affected testicular tissue most commonly shows germ cells with enlarged hyperchromatic [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] with prominent [[nucleolus|nucleoli]] and clear [[cytoplasm]].  These cells are typically arranged along the [[basement membrane]] of the tubule, and [[mitosis|mitotic]] figures are frequently seen.  The [[sertoli cells]] are pushed toward the lumen by the neoplastic germ cells, and [[spermatogenesis]] is almost always absent in the affected tubules.  [[Pagetoid]] spread of ITCGN into the [[rete testis]] is common.  [[Immunostaining]] with placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) highlights ITGCNU cell membranes in 95 percent of cases.  OCT3/4 is a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and specific]] nuclear stain of ITGCNU.<ref name=Sternberg/>

==Treatment==
ITGCN is generally treated by radiation therapy and/or [[orchiectomy]].  [[Chemotherapy]] used for [[metastatic]] germ cell tumours may also eradicate ITGCN.<ref name =Sternberg/>
