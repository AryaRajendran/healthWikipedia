[[Syphilis]] is believed to have infected {{Nowrap|12 million}} people in 1999 with greater than 90% of cases in the [[developing world]].<ref name=ST10>{{cite journal |author=Stamm LV |title=Global challenge of antibiotic-resistant Treponema pallidum |journal=Antimicrob.

In the developed world, syphilis infections were in decline until the 1980s and 1990s due to widespread use of antibiotics. Since the year 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing in the US, UK, Australia and Europe primarily among [[men who have sex with men]].<ref name=ST10/> This is attributed to unsafe sexual practices.<ref name=ST10/> 

Increased rates among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s.<ref name=ST10/> Syphilis increases the risk of [[HIV]] transmission by two to five times and co-infection is common (30–60% in a number of urban centers).<ref name=ST10/><ref name=Kent08>{{cite journal |author=Kent ME, Romanelli F |title=Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=226–36 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18212261 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K086 |url=}}</ref>

Untreated it has a mortality of 8% to 58% with a greater death rate in males.<ref name=Kent08/> The symptoms of syphilis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th&nbsp;century in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment and partly due to decreasing [[virulence]] of the spirochete.<ref name=Sec2010>{{cite journal|last=Mullooly|first=C|coauthors=Higgins, SP|title=Secondary syphilis: the classical triad of skin rash, mucosal ulceration and lymphadenopathy.|journal=International journal of STD & AIDS|date=2010 Aug|volume=21|issue=8|pages=537–45|pmid=20975084|doi=10.1258/ijsa.2010.010243}}</ref> With early treatment few complications result.<ref name=Pri2008>{{cite journal|last=Eccleston|first=K|coauthors=Collins, L, Higgins, SP|title=Primary syphilis.|journal=International journal of STD & AIDS|date=2008 Mar|volume=19|issue=3|pages=145–51|pmid=18397550|doi=10.1258/ijsa.2007.007258}}</ref>

==China==
In China rates of syphilis have increased from the 1990s to the 2010s.<ref name=China11>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=JD|coauthors=Cohen, MS|title=China's syphilis epidemic: epidemiology, proximate determinants of spread, and control responses.|journal=Current opinion in infectious diseases|date=2011 Feb|volume=24|issue=1|pages=50–5|pmid=21150594}}</ref> This occurred after a successful campaign to reduce rates was carried out in the 1950s.<ref name=China11/> Rates of diagnosis are higher in urban coastal areas.<ref name=China11/> This may be due to sexual practices or better diagnosis in these areas.<ref name=China11/>  

Rates of syphilis in 2000–2005 among low risk groups such as women without children and unmarried people were about 0.3–0.6% while rates among high risk groups such as drug users and [[men who have sex with men|MSM]] were about 7–15%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=CC|coauthors=Gao, X, Chen, XS, Chen, Q, Cohen, MS|title=China's syphilis epidemic: a systematic review of seroprevalence studies.|journal=Sexually transmitted diseases|date=2006 Dec|volume=33|issue=12|pages=726–36|pmid=16755273}}</ref> Rates are greatest among [[men who have sex with men]] and [[sex workers]].<ref name=China11/>

The increase has been attributed to a number of factors including: migration from rural communities to urban environments, increased numbers of unmarried men, limited screening for disease, partners not always getting notification, and the fact that high risk groups frequently do not seek health care.<ref name=China11/>

==Europe==
In Europe rates of syphilis are higher in eastern and southern countries than in western ones.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Uusküla|first=A|coauthors=Puur, A, Toompere, K, DeHovitz, J|title=Trends in the epidemiology of bacterial sexually transmitted infections in eastern Europe, 1995-2005.|journal=Sexually transmitted infections|date=2010 Feb|volume=86|issue=1|pages=6–14|pmid=20157177}}</ref>

==India==
Rates of congenital syphilis have decreased between the 1980 and 2000s due to better access to [[prenatal care]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dhawan|first=J|coauthors=Gupta, S, Kumar, B|title=Sexually transmitted diseases in children in India.|journal=Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology|date=2010 Sep-Oct|volume=76|issue=5|pages=489–93|pmid=20826987}}</ref>
