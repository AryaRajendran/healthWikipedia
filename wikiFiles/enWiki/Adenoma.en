An '''adenoma''' is a [[benign]] tumor (-oma) of glandular origin. Adenomas can grow from many organs including the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]],<!-- Maybe an explanation of why the colon qualifies to generate tumors "of glandular origin" is in order? --> [[adrenal glands]], [[pituitary gland]], [[thyroid]], [[prostate]], etc. Although these growths are [[benign]], over time they may progress to become [[malignancy|malignant]], at which point they are called [[adenocarcinoma]]s.  Even while benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures ([[mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]]) and by producing large amounts of [[hormones]] in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner ([[paraneoplastic syndrome]]).

== Histopathology ==

Adenoma is a benign tumor of glandular tissue, such as the mucosa of stomach, small intestine, and colon, in which tumor cells form glands or glandlike structures.
In hollow organs (digestive tract), the adenoma grows into the lumen - adenomatous [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] or polypoid adenoma. Depending on the type of the insertion base, adenoma may be pedunculated (lobular head with a long slender stalk) or sessile (broad base).

The adenomatous proliferation is characterized by different degrees of cell dysplasia (atypia or loss of normal differentiation of epithelium) irregular cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, (pseudo)stratified nuclei, nucleolus, decreased mucosecretion, and mitosis. 
The architecture may be tubular, villous, or tubulo-villous. Basement membrane and muscularis mucosae are intact.

== Locations ==
=== Colon ===

Adenomas of the colon, also called [[adenomatous polyps]], are quite prevalent. They are found commonly at [[colonoscopy]]. They are removed because of their tendency to become malignant and to lead to colon cancer.

===Renal===
This is a tumor that is most often small and asymptomatic, and is derived from renal tubules. It may be a precursor lesion to renal carcinoma.

===Adrenal ===
[[File:Adrenal adenoma2 T1FS.jpg|thumb|right|MRI scan T1 with fat saturation - adrenal adenoma]]
Adrenal adenomas are common, and are often found on the abdomen, usually not as the focus of investigation; they are usually incidental findings. About one in 10,000 is malignant. Thus, a biopsy is rarely called for, especially if the lesion is homogeneous and smaller than 3 centimeters. Follow-up images in three to six months can confirm the stability of the growth.

While some adrenal adenomas do not secrete hormones at all, often some secrete [[cortisol]], causing [[Cushing syndrome|Cushing's syndrome]], [[aldosterone]] causing [[Conn syndrome|Conn's syndrome]], or [[androgens]] causing [[hyperandrogenism]].

===Thyroid ===
About one in 10 people is found to have solitary [[thyroid]] nodules. Investigation is required because a small percentage of these is malignant. Biopsy usually confirms the growth to be an adenoma, but, sometimes, excision at surgery is required, especially when the cells found at biopsy are of the follicular type.

===Pituitary===
Pituitary adenomas are seen in 10% of neurological patients. A lot of them remain undiagnosed. Treatment is usually surgical, to which patients generally respond well. The most common subtype, [[prolactinoma]], is seen more often in women, and is frequently diagnosed during pregnancy as the hormone [[progesterone]] increases its growth. Medical therapy with [[cabergoline]] or [[bromocriptine]] generally suppresses prolactinomas; progesterone antagonist therapy has not proven to be successful.

===Parathyroid===
An adenoma of a [[parathyroid gland]] may secrete inappropriately high amounts of [[parathyroid hormone]] and thereby cause [[primary hyperparathyroidism]].

===Liver===
See [[Hepatocellular adenoma]]. Hepatic adenomas are a rare benign tumour of the liver, which may present with hepatomegaly or other symptoms.

===Breast===
Breast adenomas are called [[fibroadenoma]]s.  They are often very small and difficult to detect.  Often there are no symptoms.  Treatments can include a needle biopsy, and/or removal.

===Appendix===
Adenomas can also appear in the appendix.  The condition is extremely rare.  The most common version is called cystadenoma.  They are usually discovered in the course of examination of the tissue following an appendectomy.  If the appendix has ruptured and a tumor is present, this presents challenges, especially if malignant cells have formed and thus spread to the abdomen.

===Bronchial===
Bronchial adenomas are adenomas in the [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. They may cause [[carcinoid syndrome]], a type of [[paraneoplastic syndrome]].<ref name=Kumar6-5>Table 6-5 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

===Sebaceous===
A [[sebaceous adenoma]] is a [[cutaneous]] condition characterized by a slow-growing tumour usually presenting as a pink, flesh-coloured, or yellow papule or nodule.

===Salivary Glands===
Also major and minor salivary gland adenomas are common, specially the parotid gland adenoma more frequent and has tendency to become adenocarcinoma.

==Treatment==
A physician's response to detecting an adenoma in a patient will vary according to the type and location of the adenoma among other factors.{{fact|date=September 2012}} Different adenomas will grow at different rates, but typically physicians can anticipate the rates of growth because some types of common adenomas progress similarly in most patients.{{fact|date=September 2012}} Two common responses are removing the adenoma with surgery and then monitoring the patient according to established guidelines.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

One common example of treatment is the response recommended by [[Specialty (medicine)|specialty]] [[professional organizations]] upon removing adenomatous polyps from a patient. In the common case of removing one or two of these polyps from the colon from a patient with no particular risk factors for cancer, thereafter the best practice is to resume surveillance colonoscopy after 5-10 years rather than repeating it more frequently than the standard recommendation.<ref name="AGAfive">{{Citation |author1 =  American Gastroenterological Association |author1-link =  American Gastroenterological Association |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Gastroenterological Association]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AGA.pdf |accessdate = August 17 2012}}</ref><ref name="coloscreen">{{cite PMID|12557158}}</ref><ref name="qualindicators">{{cite PMID|16635231}}</ref>
