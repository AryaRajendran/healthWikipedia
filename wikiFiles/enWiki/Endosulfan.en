'''Endosulfan''' is an off-[[patent]] [[organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] and [[acaricide]] that is being phased out globally. The two isomers, endo and exo, are known popularly as I and II.  Endosulfan sulfate is a product of oxidation containing one extra O atom attached to the S atom. Endosulfan became a highly controversial agrichemical<ref name="AuBC">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/200907/s2628915.htm | title=Bayer to stop selling endosulfan|date=July 17, 2009 | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> due to its acute [[toxic]]ity, potential for [[bioaccumulation]], and role as an [[endocrine disruptor]]. Because of its threats to human health and the environment, a global ban on the manufacture and use of endosulfan was negotiated under the [[Stockholm Convention]] in April 2011.

It is still used extensively in India, China, and few other countries. It is produced by [[Makhteshim Agan]] and several manufacturers in India and China.

==Uses==
Endosulfan has been used in agriculture around the world to control insect pests including [[whitefly]]s, [[aphids]], [[leafhopper]]s, [[Colorado potato beetle]]s and [[cabbage worm]]s.<ref name=Canada/> Due to its unique mode of action, it is useful in resistance management; however, as it is not specific, it can negatively impact populations of beneficial insects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI03900.pdf|title=Florida Crop/Pest Management Profiles: Tomatoes.

==Production==
The [[World Health Organization]] estimated worldwide annual production to be about 9,000 [[metric tonne]]s (t) in the early 1980s.<ref name="EHC">World Health Organization, [http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc40.htm ''Environmental Health Criteria 40''], 1984.</ref> From 1980 to 1989, worldwide consumption averaged 10,500 tonnes per year, and for the 1990s use increased to 12,800 tonnes per year.

Endosulfan is a derivative of [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]], and is chemically similar to [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], and [[heptachlor]]. Specifically, it is produced by the  [[Diels Alder|Diels-Alder]] reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with ''cis''-butene-1,4-diol and subsequent reaction of the adduct with [[thionyl chloride]]. Technical endosulfan is a 7:3 mixture of [[stereoisomers]], designated α and β.  α- and β-Endosulfan are conformational [[isomers]] arising from the pyramidal stereochemistry of sulfur. α-Endosulfan is the more thermodynamically stable of the two, thus β-endosulfan irreversibly converts to the α form, although the conversion is slow.<ref>(a) Schmidt WF, Hapeman CJ, Fettinger JC, Rice CP, and Bilboulian S, '' J.

==History of commercialization and regulation==
*Early 1950s: Endosulfan was developed.
*1954: [[Hoechst AG]] (now [[Bayer CropScience]]) won [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] approval for the use of endosulfan in the United States.<ref name="ATSDR">Agency of Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp41.html ''Toxicological Profile for Endosulfan''], 2000.</ref>
*2000: Home and garden use in the United States was terminated by agreement with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].<ref name="RED"/>
*2002: The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] recommended that endosulfan registration should be cancelled,<ref>{{Cite news  | last = Kay  | first = Jane  | title = A move to ease pesticide laws  | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle  | pages = A1  | date = March 2, 2006  | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/02/MNG0JHH6NH1.DTL}}.</ref> and the EPA determined that endosulfan residues on food and in water pose unacceptable risks. The agency allowed endosulfan to stay on the US market, but imposed restrictions on its agricultural uses.<ref name="RED"/>
*2007: International steps were taken to restrict the use and trade of endosulfan. It is recommended for inclusion in the [[Rotterdam Convention]] on [[Prior Informed Consent]],<ref name=DGD/> and the [[European Union]] proposed inclusion in the list of chemicals banned under the [[Stockholm Convention|Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]. Such inclusion would ban all use and manufacture of endosulfan globally.<ref name=Stockholm/> Meanwhile, the Canadian government announced that endosulfan was under consideration for phase-out,<ref>''Canada to end endosulfan use?'' [http://www.agrow.co.uk Agrow], Oct 22, 2007.</ref> and Bayer CropScience voluntarily pulled its endosulfan products from the U.S. market<ref>[http://www.panna.org/files/EPA-HQ-OPP-2002-0262-0057.pdf Note to Reader.

==Health effects==
Endosulfan is one of the most toxic pesticides on the market today, responsible for many fatal pesticide poisoning incidents around the world.<ref>Pesticide Action Network North America, [http://www.panna.org/magazine/fall2006/featureSpeakingTruth.html Speaking the Truth Saves Lives in the Philippines and India], ''PAN Magazine'', Fall 2006.</ref> Endosulfan is also a [[xenoestrogen]]—a synthetic substance that imitates or enhances the effect of [[estrogen]]s—and it can act as an [[endocrine disruptor]], causing reproductive and developmental damage in both animals and humans. Whether endosulfan can [[carcinogen|cause cancer]] is debated. With regard to consumers' intake of endosulfan from residues on food, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations]] has concluded that long-term exposure from food is unlikely to present a public health concern, but short-term exposure can exceed acute [[reference dose]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/JMPR/DOWNLOAD/2006_rep/report2006jmpr.pdf|title= Pesticide residues in food 2006 - Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)|year=2006}}</ref>

===Toxicity===
Endosulfan is acutely [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] to both [[insects]] and [[mammals]], including humans. The US EPA classifies it as Category I: "Highly Acutely Toxic" based on a [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] value of 30&nbsp;mg/kg for female [[rats]],<ref name="RED"/> while the World Health Organization classifies it as Class II "Moderately Hazardous" based on a rat LD<sub>50</sub> of 80&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_rev_3.pdf ''The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard''], 2005.</ref> It is a [[Gaba receptor|GABA-gated chloride channel]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]], and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> [[ATPase]] [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]. Both of these [[enzymes]] are involved in the transfer of nerve impulses. Symptoms of acute poisoning include hyperactivity, tremors, convulsions, lack of coordination, staggering, difficulty breathing, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, unconsciousness.<ref name="ATSDR"/> Doses as low as 35&nbsp;mg/kg have been documented to cause death in humans,<ref name="PIM">International Programme on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization, [http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/pim576.htm ''Endosulfan (Poison Information Monograph 576)''], July 2000.</ref> and many cases of sublethal poisoning have resulted in permanent brain damage.<ref name="ATSDR"/> Farm workers with [[Habit (psychology)|chronic]] endosulfan exposure are at risk of rashes and skin irritation.<ref name="RED"/>

EPA's acute reference dose for dietary exposure to endosulfan is 0.015&nbsp;mg/kg for adults and 0.0015&nbsp;mg/kg for children. For chronic dietary expsoure, the EPA references doses are 0.006&nbsp;mg/(kg·day) and 0.0006&nbsp;mg/(kg·day) for adults and children, respectively.<ref name="RED"/>

===Endocrine disruption===
[[Theo Colborn]], an expert on endocrine disruption, lists endosulfan as a known endocrine disruptor,<ref>Colborn T, Dumanoski D, Meyers JP, Our Stolen Future : How We Are Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence and Survival, 1997, Plume.</ref> and both the EPA and the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] consider endosulfan to be a potential endocrine disruptor.  Numerous ''[[in vitro]]'' studies have documented its potential to disrupt hormones and animal studies have demonstrated its reproductive and developmental toxicity, especially among males.<ref name="RED"/><ref name="ATSDR"/> A number of studies have documented that it acts as an [[androgen|antiandrogen]] in animals.<ref name="pmid9465275">{{cite journal | author = Wilson VS, LeBlanc GA | title = Endosulfan elevates testosterone biotransformation and clearance in CD-1 mice | journal = Toxicol.

===Reproductive and developmental effects===
Several studies have documented that endosulfan can also affect human development. Researchers studying children from many villages in [[Kasargod]] District, [[Kerala]], India, have linked endosulfan exposure to delays in [[puberty|sexual maturity]] among boys. Endosulfan was the only pesticide applied to [[cashew]] plantations in the villages for 20 years, and had contaminated the village environment. The researchers compared the villagers to a control group of boys from a demographically similar village that lacked a history of endosulfan pollution. Relative to the control group, the exposed boys had high levels of endosulfan in their bodies, lower levels of [[testosterone]], and delays in reaching sexual maturity. [[Birth defects]] of the male reproductive system, including [[cryptorchidism]], were also more prevalent in the study group. The researchers concluded, "our study results suggest that endosulfan exposure in male children may delay sexual maturity and interfere with sex hormone synthesis."<ref name="Saiyed">Saiyed H, Dewan A, Bhatnagar V, ''et al.'', [http://www.ehponline.org/members/2003/6271/6271.pdf Effect of Endosulfan on Male Reproductive Development], ''Environ.

A 2007 study by the California Department of Public Health found that women who lived near farm fields sprayed with endosulfan and the related organochloride pesticide [[dicofol]] during the first eight weeks of pregnancy are several times more likely to give birth to children with [[autism]]. This is the first study to look for an association between endosulfan and autism, and additional study is needed to confirm the connection.<ref>(a) {{cite journal |journal=Environ.

===Endosulfan and cancer===
Endosulfan is not listed as known, probable, or possible carcinogen by the EPA, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], or other agencies. No epidemiological studies link exposure to endosulfan specifically to cancer in humans, but ''in vitro'' assays have shown that endosulfan can promote proliferation of human [[breast cancer]] cells.<ref>(a) Grunfeld HT, Bonefeld-Jorgensen EC, Effect of ''in vitro'' estrogenic pesticides on human oestrogen receptor alpha and beta mRNA levels, ''Toxicol.

==Environmental fate==
Endosulfan is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. The chemical is [[Semi-Volatile Organic Compound|semivolatile]] and persistent to degradation processes in the environment. Endosulfan is subject to [[global distillation|long-range atmospheric transport]], ''i.e.'' it can travel long distances from where it is used. Thus, it occurs in many environmental compartments. For example, a 2008 report by the [[National Park Service]] found that endosulfan commonly contaminates air, water, plants, and fish of [[national park]]s in the US. Most of these parks are far from areas where endosulfan is used.<ref>[http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/Studies/air_toxics/wacap.cfm Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project], National Park Service.</ref> Endosulfan has been found in remote locations such as the Arctic Ocean, as well as in the Antarctic atmosphere.<ref name="sciencedirect">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969709010882 Endosulfan, a global pesticide: A review of its fate in the environment and occurrence in the Arctic], Science of The Total Environment, Volume 408, Issue 15.</ref> The pesticide has also been detected in dust from the [[Sahara Desert]] collected in the [[Caribbean]] after being blown across the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite news   | last =  Ramnarine  | first = Kristy| title = Harmful elements in Sahara dust   | publisher = Trinidad & Tobago Express  | date = May 12, 2008  | url = http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161321883| accessdate = 2008-05-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The compound has been shown to be one of the most abundant organochlorine pesticides in the global atmosphere.<ref name="sciencedirect" />

The compound breaks down into endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan diol, and endosulfan furan, all of which have structures similar to the parent compound and, according to the EPA, "are also of toxicological concern…The estimated half-lives for the combined toxic residues (endosulfan plus endosulfan sulfate) [range] from roughly 9 months to 6 years." The EPA concluded, "[b]ased on environmental fate laboratory studies, terrestrial field dissipation studies, available models, monitoring studies, and published literature, it can be concluded that endosulfan is a very persistent chemical which may stay in the environment for lengthy periods of time, particularly in acid media." The EPA also concluded, "[e]ndosulfan has relatively high potential to [[bioaccumulate]] in fish."<ref name="RED"/> It is also toxic to [[amphibians]]; low levels have been found to kill [[tadpole]]s.<ref>Relyea RA (2008) A cocktail of contaminants: how mixtures of pesticides at low concentrations affect aquatic communities.

In 2009, the committee of scientific experts of the Stockholm Convention concluded, "endosulfan is likely, as a result of long range environmental transport, to lead to significant adverse human health and environmental effects such that global action is warranted."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Earth Negotiations Bulletin|date=Monday, 19 October 2009|title=Briefing Note on the 5th Meeting of the POPRC|publisher=International Institute for Sustainable Development |url=http://www.iisd.ca/chemical/pops/poprc5/brief/brief_POPRC5e.pdf}}</ref> In May 2011, the Stockholm Convention committee approved the recommendation for elimination of production and use of endosulfan and its isomers worldwide.

Later, on a petition filed in the [[Supreme Court of India]], the production, storage, sale and use of the pesticide was temporarily banned on 13 May 2011, and later permanently by the end of 2011.

The [[Karnataka]] government also banned the use of endosulfan with immediate effect. Briefing presspersons after the State Cabinet meeting, Minister for Higher Education V.S. Acharya said the Cabinet discussed the harmful effects of endosulfan on the health of farmers and people living in rural areas. The government will now invoke the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 (a Central act) and write a letter to the Union Government about the ban. Minister for Energy, and Food and Civil Supplies Shobha Karandlaje, who has been spearheading a movement seeking a ban on endosulfan, said, "I am grateful to Chief Minister [[B.S.

The Supreme Court passed interim order on May 13, 2011, in a Writ Petition filed by Democratic Youth Federation of India, (DYFI), a youth wing of Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the backdrop of the incidents reported in Kasargode, Kerala, and banned the production, distribution and use of endosulfan in India because the pesticide has debilitating effects on humans and the environment. The [http://www.cseindia.org/content/cse-welcomes-supreme-court-ban-endosulfan Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)] welcomed this order, and called it a 'resounding defeat' for the pesticide industry which has been promoting this deadly toxin. [http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/CSE_report-1.pdf A 2001 study by CSE] had established the linkages between the aerial spraying of the pesticide and the growing health disorders in Kasaragod. Over the years, other studies have confirmed these findings, and the health hazards associated with endosulfan are now widely known and accepted. However, in July 2012, the Government asked the Supreme Court to allow use of the pesticide in all states except Kerala and Karnataka, as these states are ready to use it for pest control.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3688642.ece|title= Allow use of endosulfan except in Kerala and Karnataka| date= 27 July 2012}}</ref>
