'''Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)''' is a common side-effect of many [[cancer]] treatments. [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related [[side effects]] for cancer patients and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving [[chemotherapy]] ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side effects, respectively. Up to 20% of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/0-387-31056-8_83 |chapter=Nausea and Vomiting in the Cancer Patient |title=Oncology |year=2006 |last1=Gill |first1=Paula |last2=Grothey |first2=Axel |last3=Loprinzi |first3=Charles |isbn=978-0-387-24291-0 |pages=1482–96}}</ref>  Since the 1990s, several novel classes of [[antiemetics]] have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to better manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients.  Efficient mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient, and better overall health of the patient, and, due to better patient tolerance, more effective treatment cycles.

==Types==
There are several subtypes of CINV.  The classifications of nausea and vomiting are:<ref name="oncuview">[http://www.oncuview.tv/SymptomManagement/tabid/67/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/22/Chemotherapy-Induced-Nausea-and-Vomiting-CINV.aspx] "Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting"</ref>
*Acute: occurring within 24 hours of chemotherapy
*Delayed: occurring between 24 hours and 5 days after treatment
*Breakthrough: occurring despite prophylactic treatment
*Anticipatory: triggered by taste, odor, memories, visions, or anxiety related to chemotherapy
*Refractory: occurring during subsequent cycles when antiemetics have failed in earlier cycles

==Cause==
[[Emesis]] is a defense mechanism controlled by the [[area postrema]] of the [[medulla oblongata]].  There are various sources of input to the vomiting center.  Receptors on the floor of the fourth ventricle of the brain represent the chemoreceptor trigger zone.  The chemoreceptor trigger zone contains [[dopamine receptors|dopamine D2 receptors]], [[5-HT receptor|serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors]], [[opioid receptor]]s, [[acetylcholine receptor]]s, and receptors for [[substance P]]. Stimulation of different receptors are involved in different pathways leading to emesis. In the final common pathway, substance P, which activates the [[NK1 receptor|Neurokinin-1 receptor]], appears to be involved.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(01)00849-X |title=Central neurocircuitry associated with emesis |year=2001 |last1=Hornby |first1=P |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=111 |issue=8 |pmid=11749934 |pages=106S–112S}}</ref> Additionally, the vagal and enteric nervous system inputs transmit information regarding the state of the gastrointestinal system. Irritation of the GI mucosa by chemotherapy, radiation, distention, or acute infectious gastroenteritis activates the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors of these inputs.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=233–42 |doi=10.1254/fpj.108.233 |title=Role of serotonin in emesis |year=1996 |last1=Minami |first1=Masaru |last2=Endo |first2=Toru |last3=Hirafuji |first3=Masahiko |journal=Folia Pharmacologica Japonica |volume=108 |issue=5 |pmid=8974084}}</ref> It is now widely known that cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents cause a detectable increase in blood levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite, [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA).<ref>{{cite journal |pages=491–507 |doi=10.1248/yakushi.124.491 |title=Serotonin and Anticancer Drug-induced Emesis |year=2004 |last1=Minami |first1=Masaru |last2=Endo |first2=Toru |last3=Hamaue |first3=Naoya |last4=Hirafuji |first4=Masahiko |journal=Yakugaku Zasshi |volume=124 |issue=8 |pmid=15297719}}</ref> The presence of these chemicals in the blood activate 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, in turn releasing substance P, which activates NK<sub>1</sub> receptors to cause an emetic response (vomiting).

==Risk factors==
The risk of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting varies based on the type of treatment received, as well as several outside factors.  Some types of chemotherapy are more prone to causing nausea and vomiting than others.  Some chemotheraputic agents may not cause nausea and vomiting on their own, but may when used in combination with other agents.<ref name="cesamet">{{cite web

==Treatments==
There are several methods of treatment available to help prevent CINV.  Pharmaceutical treatment is generally separated into two types: prophylactic (preventative) treatment, given before the dose of chemotherapy agents, and rescue treatment, given to treat breakthrough nausea and vomiting.

=== 5-HT<sub>3</sub> inhibitors ===
[[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists]] are very effective [[antiemetic]]s and constitute a great advance in the management of CINV. These drugs block one or more of the nerve signals that cause nausea and vomiting.  During the first 24 hours after chemotherapy, the most effective approach appears to be blocking the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> nerve signal{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. Approved 5-HT<sub>3</sub> inhibitors include [[dolasetron]] (Anzemet), [[granisetron]] (Kytril, Sancuso), and [[ondansetron]] (Zofran). The newest 5-HT<sub>3</sub> inhibitor, [[palonosetron]] (Aloxi), also prevents delayed nausea and vomiting, which can occur during the 2–5 days after treatment.  Since some patients have trouble swallowing pills, these drugs are often available by [[injection (medicine)|injection]], as [[orally disintegrating tablet]]s, or as [[transdermal patch]]es.

=== NK<sub>1</sub> inhibitors ===
A newer class of drugs known as the [[NK1 receptor antagonist|NK<sub>1</sub> antagonists]] are a recently developed class of very efficacious drugs for controlling CINV.  These drugs are often used alongside 5HT<sub>3</sub> inhibitors and corticosteroids to form a very potent cocktail of antiemetics that verge on achieving a nearly complete patient response (that is, completely stopping CINV).<ref name="nk1">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cncr.21222 |title=Antiemetic efficacy of the neurokinin-1 antagonist, aprepitant, plus a 5HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid in patients receiving anthracyclines or cyclophosphamide in addition to high-dose cisplatin |year=2005 |last1=Gralla |first1=Richard J. |last2=De Wit |first2=Ronald |last3=Herrstedt |first3=Jorn |last4=Carides |first4=Alexandra D. |last5=Ianus |first5=Juliana |last6=Guoguang-Ma |first6=Julie |last7=Evans |first7=Judith K. |last8=Horgan |first8=Kevin J. |journal=Cancer |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=864–8 |pmid=15973669}}</ref>  The [[substance P]] inhibitor [[aprepitant]] (Emend), which became available in 2005, is highly effective in controlling nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.<ref name="nk1"/> Aprepitant has been shown to inhibit both the acute and delayed emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brains neurons. This has been proven by [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) studies, which have demonstrated that aprepitant can penetrate the brain and NK<sub>1</sub> receptors in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.02.007 |title=Human positron emission tomography studies of brain neurokinin 1 receptor occupancy by aprepitant |year=2004 |last1=Bergström |first1=Mats |last2=Hargreaves |first2=Richard J |last3=Burns |first3=H.Donald |last4=Goldberg |first4=Michael R |last5=Sciberras |first5=David |last6=Reines |first6=Scott A |last7=Petty |first7=Kevin J |last8=Ögren |first8=Mattias |last9=Antoni |first9=Gunnar |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=1007–12 |pmid=15121485}}</ref> It has also been shown to increase the activity of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists ondansetron and the corticosteroid [[dexamethasone]], which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.<ref name="nk1"/>

=== Other drugs ===
[[Olanzapine]], as well as several other [[neuroleptic|neuroleptic drugs]], have also has been investigated for the control of CINV.<ref name="oncologist">{{cite journal |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.12-9-1143 |title=Guidelines for Antiemetic Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Past, Present, and Future Recommendations |year=2007 |last1=Jordan |first1=K. |last2=Sippel |first2=C. |last3=Schmoll |first3=H.-J. |journal=The Oncologist |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1143–50 |pmid=17914084}}</ref> A 2007 study demonstrated Olanzapine's successful potential for this use, achieving a complete response in the acute prevention of nausea and vomiting in 100% of patients treated with moderately and highly-emetogenic chemotherapy, when used in combination with palonosetron and [[dexamethasone]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1285–91 |doi=10.1007/s00520-007-0248-5 |title=A phase II trial of olanzapine, dexamethasone, and palonosetron for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: A Hoosier oncology group study |year=2007 |last1=Navari |first1=Rudolph M. |last2=Einhorn |first2=Lawrence H. |last3=Loehrer |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Passik |first4=Steven D. |last5=Vinson |first5=Jake |last6=McClean |first6=John |last7=Chowhan |first7=Naveed |last8=Hanna |first8=Nasser H. |last9=Johnson |first9=Cynthia S. |journal=Supportive Care in Cancer |volume=15 |issue=11 |pmid=17375339}}</ref> Neuroleptic agents are now indicated for rescue treatment and the control of breakthrough nausea and vomiting.<ref name="oncologist"/>

Some studies<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7303.16 |title=Cannabinoids for control of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting: Quantitative systematic |year=2001 |last1=Tramer |first1=M.

Synthesized [[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (also one of the main active substances in marijuana) is marketed as [[Marinol]] and may be practical for this application. Natural marijuana, known as [[medical cannabis]] is also used and recommended by some oncologists, though its use is regulated and it is not legal in all jurisdictions.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/about-apropos/faq_e.html "Frequently Asked Questions - Medical Marihuana"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Marinol was less effective than [[megestrol]] in helping cancer patients regain lost appetites.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jatoi A, Windschitl HE, Loprinzi CL, ''et al.'' |title=Dronabinol versus megestrol acetate versus combination therapy for cancer-associated anorexia: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group study |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|publisher=[[American Society of Clinical Oncology]]|location=Alexandria, VA|volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=567–73 |year=2002|pmid=11786587 |doi=10.1200/JCO.20.2.567|format=PDF |laysummary=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/423300 |laysource=[[Medscape]] |laydate=30 January 2002 |last12=Christensen |first12=B }}</ref> A phase III study found no difference in effects of an oral cannabis extract or THC on appetite and quality of life (QOL) in patients with cancer-related [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]-[[cachexia]] [[syndrome]] (CACS) to [[placebo]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strasser|first=F|coauthors=Luftner D, Possinger K, ''et al.''|date=20 July 2006|title=Comparison of Orally Administered Cannabis Extract and Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Treating Patients With Cancer-Related Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome: A Multicenter, Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial From the Cannabis-In-Cachexia-Study-Group|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|publisher=[[American Society of Clinical Oncology]]|location=Alexandria, VA|volume=24|issue=21|pages=3394–3400|doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.05.1847|pmid=16849753|last2=Strasser|first2=F|last3=Luftner|first3=D|last4=Possinger|first4=K|last5=Ernst|first5=G|last6=Ruhstaller|first6=T|last7=Meissner|first7=W|last8=Ko|first8=YD|last9=Schnelle|first9=M}}</ref>

[[Dexamethasone]], a corticosteroid, is often used alongside other antiemetic drugs, as it has synergistic action with many of them, although its specific antiemetic mechanism of action is not fully understood. [[Metoclopramide]], a [[5-HT4#Agonists|5HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist]], is an older drug that is sometimes used, either on its own or in combination with others. [[Histamine]] blockers such as [[diphenhydramine]] or [[meclozine]] may be used in rescue treatment. [[Lorazepam]] and [[Diazepam]] may sometimes be used to relieve anxiety associated with CINV before administration of chemotherapy, and are also often used in the case of rescue treatment.<ref name="oncologist"/>

=== Alternative treatments ===
Non-pharmacological approaches to remedy CINV typically involve small lifestyle alterations, such as using unscented deodorants and soaps, avoiding strong scents altogether, and dietary modifications such as eating several small meals throughout the day, eating high-protein, high-calorie food, drinking lots of clear liquids, and removing spicy, fatty, fried, or acidic foods from the diet.<ref name="sancusotips">[http://www.sancuso.com/patient/cinv/whatToDo.php] "How to Prevent CINV, Minimize CINV"</ref>  Patients may also participate in alternative practices such as self-hypnosis, relaxation and imagery therapy, distraction, music therapy, biofeedback, desensitization, or accupressure.<ref name="oncuview"/> Also, recent trial studies have shown that [[lung cancer]] patients taking fish oil daily help maintain their weight during chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Rachel|title=Fish oil no snake oil for chemotherapy|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&hid=12&sid=d8b41f3d-7288-46f9-92a0-ad027f6f5ee3%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=ulh&AN=64078377|publisher=New Scientist}}</ref>
