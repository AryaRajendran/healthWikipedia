The '''palatine bone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə|t|aɪ|n}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palatine Entry "palatine"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) is a [[bone]] in many species of the animal kingdom, commonly termed the [[palatum]] (Latin ''palatum''; unrelated to ''palatium'' 'palace', from which other senses of [[palatine]] derive).

== Human anatomy ==
It is situated at the back part of the [[nasal cavity]] between the [[maxilla]] and the pterygoid process of the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]]. 

It contributes to the walls of three cavities: the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity, the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the orbit; it enters into the formation of two fossæ, the [[Pterygopalatine fossa|pterygopalatine]] and [[pterygoid fossa|pterygoid]] fossæ; and one fissure, the [[inferior orbital fissure]]. 

The palatine bone somewhat resembles the letter L, and consists of a [[Horizontal plate of palatine bone]] and a [[Perpendicular plate of palatine bone]] and three outstanding processes—viz., the [[Pyramidal process of palatine bone]], which is directed backward and lateralward from the junction of the two parts, and the [[Orbital process of palatine bone]] and [[Sphenoidal process of palatine bone]], which surmount the vertical part, and are separated by a deep notch, the sphenopalatine notch.

The human palatine articulates with six bones: the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], [[ethmoid]], [[maxilla]], [[inferior nasal concha]], [[vomer]] and opposite palatine.

==In other animals==
In [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] the palatine bone consists of the perpendicular plate only, lying on the inner edge of the maxilla. The lower surface of the bone may bear several teeth, forming a second row behind those of the maxilla; in many cases, these are actually larger than the maxillary teeth. Although a similar pattern was present in primitive [[tetrapod]]s, the palatine bone is reduced in most living [[amphibian]]s, forming, in [[frog]]s and [[salamander]]s, only a narrow bar between the vomer and maxilla.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 220–243|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

Early fossil [[reptile]]s retained the arrangement seen in more primitive vertebrates, but in [[mammal]]s, the lower surface of the palatine became folded over during evolution, forming the horizontal plate, and meeting in the midline of the mouth. This forms the rear of the [[hard palate]], separating the oral and nasal cavities, and making it easier to breathe while eating. A [[parallel evolution|parallel]] development has occurred to varying degrees in many living reptiles, reaching its greatest extent in [[crocodilian]]s. In [[bird]]s, the palatine bones remain separate, long the sides of the rear part of the upper jaw, and typically have a mobile articulation with the [[cranium]].<ref name=VB/>

There are numerous variations amongst mammals, amphibians and other species. For example, the palatine bone in many amphibians such as the [[Rough-skinned Newt]] manifests as a distinct V-shaped structure.<ref>C.

Stromberg [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182]</ref> In the case of cat species, the horizontal and a vertical elements join at a forty five degree angle.<ref>Jacob Reighard and Herbert Spencer Jennings, ''Anatomy of the Cat''</ref>
