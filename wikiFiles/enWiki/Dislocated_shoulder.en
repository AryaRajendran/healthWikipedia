A '''dislocated shoulder''' occurs when the [[humerus]] separates from the [[scapula]] at the [[glenohumeral joint]]. The shoulder joint has the greatest range of motion of any joint in the body and as a result is particularly susceptible to dislocation and [[subluxation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Good CR, MacGillivray JD |title=Traumatic shoulder dislocation in the adolescent athlete: advances in surgical treatment |journal=Curr. Opin. Pediatr. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=25–9 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15659959 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-8703&volume=17&issue=1&spage=25 |doi=10.1097/01.mop.0000147905.92602.bb}}</ref>  Approximately half of major [[joint dislocation]]s seen in emergency departments are of the shoulder.  Partial dislocation of the shoulder is referred to as [[subluxation]].

==Classification==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Anterior (forward)===
Over 95% of [[shoulder]] dislocation cases are anterior.  Most anterior dislocations are sub-[[coracoid]].  Sub-[[glenoid]], sub[[clavicle|clavicular]], and, very rarely, [[intrathoracic]] or [[retroperitoneal]] dislocations may occur.<ref>{{EMedicine|orthoped|440|Shoulder Dislocations}}</ref>

Anterior dislocations are usually caused by a direct blow to or fall on an outstretched arm. The patient typically appears holding their arm externally rotated and slightly abducted.

It can result in damage to the [[axillary artery]]<ref name="pmid15488503">{{cite journal |author=Kelley SP, Hinsche AF, Hossain JF |title=Axillary artery transection following anterior shoulder dislocation: classical presentation and current concepts |journal=Injury |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=1128–32 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15488503 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2003.08.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020138303003346}}</ref> and axillary nerve (C5, C6). Damage to the [[axillary nerve]] results in a weakened or paralysed [[deltoid muscle]]. As the deltoid atrophies unilaterally, the normal rounded contour of the shoulder is lost. A patient with injury to the axillary nerve will have difficulty in [[abducting]] the arm from approximately 15° away from the body. The [[supraspinatus muscle]] initiates abduction from a fully adducted position.

===Posterior (backward)===

Posterior dislocations are occasionally due to [[electric shock]] or seizure and may be caused by strength imbalance of the rotator cuff muscles. Patients typically present holding their arm internally rotated and adducted, and exhibiting flattening of the anterior shoulder and a prominent coracoid process.

Posterior dislocations often go unnoticed, especially in an [[elderly]] patient<ref>{{EMedicine|emerg|148|Dislocations, Shoulder}}</ref> and in the unconscious trauma patient.<ref>Life in the Fast Lane [http://lifeinthefastlane.com/2009/06/posterior-shoulder-dislocation/ Posterior Shoulder Dislocation]</ref> An average interval of 1 year was discovered between injury and diagnosis of posterior dislocation in a series of 40 patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hawkins RJ, Neer CS, Pianta RM, Mendoza FX |title=Locked posterior dislocation of the shoulder |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=9–18 |year=1987 |month=January |pmid=3805075 |url=http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/3805075?src=emed_ckb_ref_0}}</ref>

===Inferior (downward)===

Inferior dislocation is the least likely form, occurring in less than 1% of all shoulder dislocation cases.  This condition is also called luxatio erecta because the arm appears to be permanently held upward or behind the head.<ref>{{EMedicine|emerg|148|Dislocations, Shoulder|clinical}}</ref>  It is caused by a hyper abduction of the arm that forces the humeral head against the acromion.  Inferior dislocations have a high complication rate as many vascular, neurological, tendon, and [[ligament]] injuries are likely to occur from this kind of dislocation.

==Signs==
* Significant [[pain]], which can sometimes be felt along the arm past the [[shoulder]].
* Inability to move the arm from its current position, particularly in positions with the arm reaching away from the body and with the top of the [[arm]] twisted toward the back.
* [[Numbness]] of the arm.
* Visibly displaced shoulder.  Some dislocations result in the shoulder appearing unusually square.
* No [[bone]] in the side of the shoulder showing shoulder has become dislocated.

==Treatment==
===Initial===
Prompt professional medical treatment should be sought for any suspected dislocation injury.
Usually, a dislocated shoulder is kept in its current position by use of a [[splint (medicine)|splint]] or sling (however, see below).  A pillow between the [[arm]] and [[torso]] may provide support and increase comfort. Strong analgesics are needed to allay the pain of a dislocation and the anxiety associated with it, and hence, conservative measures of [[pain relief]] should not be attempted.

[[Emergency department]] care is focused on returning the shoulder to its normal position via processes known as [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]].  Normally, closed reduction, in which several methods are used to manipulate the bone and [[joint]] from the outside, is used.  A variety of techniques exist, but some are preferred due to fewer [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s or easier execution.<ref>{{EMedicine|emerg|148|Dislocations, Shoulder|workup}}</ref>  In cases where closed reduction is not successful, surgical open reduction may be needed.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dislocated-shoulder/DS00597/DSECTION=8 Dislocated shoulder: Treatment - MayoClinic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Following reduction, [[X-Ray|x-ray]] imaging is often used to ensure that the reduction was successful and there are no [[fracture]]s.  The arm should be kept in a sling or immobilizer for several days, preferably until [[orthopedic]] consultation.
[[Hippocrates]]' and [[Kocher manoeuvre|Kocher]]'s method are rarely used anymore. Hippocrates used to place the [[heel]] in the [[axilla]] and reduce [[shoulder dislocation]]s.
Kocher's method, if performed patiently and slowly, can be performed without [[anesthesia]] and if done correctly does not cause  [[pain]]. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] is applied on the arm and it is abducted. Then, it is externally rotated, and the arm is adducted following which it is internally rotated and maintained in the position with the help of a sling. A [[chest x-ray]] should be taken to confirm whether the head of humerus has reduced back into the [[glenoid cavity]]. This methodology is performed with external rotation of shoulder, and adduction of the elbow. Some do not recommend it because of possible neurovascular complications and proximal humerus fractures.

If no medical help is available, for anterior dislocations fairly simple methods can be attempted, such as Milch's method or Stimson's Method.

In Australia, an anterior dislocation reduction method that is commonly used is the Spaso technique.<ref name="spaso2">{{cite journal |author=Miljesic, Kelly|title=Reduction of anterior dislocation of the shoulder: the Spaso technique |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=173–5 |year=1998 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-2026.1998.tb00676.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-2026.1998.tb00676.x/abstract |last2=Kelly |first2=Anne-Maree}}</ref> This technique was first used by Spaso Miljesic, a nurse specialising in orthopaedics at Western Health, Melbourne, Australia. The technique is reliable and simple. Holding the patient's wrist, gently flex the arm at the shoulder joint with an extended elbow until 90 degrees is achieved. Then apply gentle traction and external rotation. Listen for a clunk indicating relocation. If the patient experiences pain and muscle spasm, wait until it subsides and gently continue. Procedural sedation may be useful. A recent study<ref name="spaso1">{{cite journal |author=Yuen, Gap, Chan, Tung |title=An easy method to reduce anterior shoulder dislocation: the Spaso technique |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=370–2 |year=2001 |doi=10.1136/emj.18.5.370 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/18/5/370.abstract |pmid=11559608 |pmc=1725682}}</ref> found the Spaso technique useful in 87.5% of cases of anterior dislocation with no complications.

The most recent style of shoulder reduction is the [[Cunningham Shoulder Reduction|Cunningham shoulder reduction]], utilizing adduction of a flexed arm with concurrent bicipital massage and postero-superior shrug by the patient. This is a rather new technique but has seen positive outcomes in the ER.

===Post-reduction: immobilisation in external versus internal rotation===
For thousands of years, treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation has included immobilisation of the patient's arm in a sling, with the arm placed in internal rotation (across the body). However, three studies, one in cadavers and two in patients, suggest that the detachment of the structures in the front of the shoulder is made worse when the shoulder is placed in internal rotation to be seen. By contrast, the structures are realigned when the arm is placed in external rotation.  New data suggest that if the shoulder is managed non-operatively and immobilised, it should be immobilised in a position of external rotation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murrell GA |title=Treatment of shoulder dislocation: is a sling appropriate? |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=179 |issue=7 |pages=370–1 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14503903 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/179_07_061003/mur10335_fm.html}}<br/>{{cite web |author=Murrell GA |title=We got it wrong on shoulder dislocation. Don't use a sling |publisher=Orthopaedic Research Institute, Dept. Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, University of New South Wales |url=http://www.ori.org.au/bonejoint/shoulder/ssfd.htm}}</ref>

Another study found that conventional shoulder immobilisation in a sling offered no benefit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chalidis B, Sachinis N, Dimitriou C, Papadopoulos P, Samoladas E, Pournaras J |title=Has the management of shoulder dislocation changed over time? |journal=Int Orthop |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=385–9 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=16909255 |pmc=2267594 |doi=10.1007/s00264-006-0183-y |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/e845216618wj6247/}}</ref>

===Surgery===
[[File:Post Dislocated shoulder MRI 01.png|thumb|MRI of shoulder after dislocation with Hill-Sachs lesion and labral Bankart's lesion.]]
Some cases require non-emergency surgery to repair damage to the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s surrounding in the [[shoulder joint]] and restore shoulder stability.   [[Arthroscopic surgery]] techniques may be used to repair the [[glenoidal labrum]], [[capsular ligaments]], [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] long head anchor or [[SLAP tear|SLAP lesion]] and/or to tighten the shoulder capsule.<ref>[http://www.orthop.washington.edu/?q=patient-care/articles/sports/shoulder-scope.html Considering [[surgery]] - Arthroscopic shoulder surgery for dislocation, [[subluxation]], and instability: why, when and how it is done<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The time-proven surgical treatment for recurrent anterior instability of the shoulder is a Bankart repair.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.orthop.washington.edu/openbankart | title=Bankart repair for unstable dislocating shoulders:  |publisher=University of Washington: Orthopaedics and [[Sports Medicine]] }}</ref> Surgery to anatomically and securely repair the torn anterior [[glenoid labrum]] and [[Articular capsule|capsule]] without [[arthroscopy]] can lessen pain and improve function for active individuals. When the front of the shoulder socket has been broken or worn, a bone graft may be required to restore stability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orthop.washington.edu/shoulderbonegraft |title=Anterior glenoid reconstruction for unstable dislocating shoulders. |publisher=University of Washington: Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine }}</ref> 
When the shoulder dislocates posteriorly (out the back), a surgery to reshape the socket may be necessary. Surgery to build up the back of the glenoid socket using an [[osteotomy]] and [[Medical grafting|graft]] can restore shoulder [[anatomy]] and lessen pain and improve function. Conversely, there are new procedures that should be investigated as a possible alternative to [[open surgery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00034 |title=Thermal Capsulorrhaphy |publisher=[[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]] }}</ref>

===Non-operative===
[[Rotator cuff]] and deltoid strengthening has long been the focus of conservative treatment for the unstable shoulder and in many cases is advocated as a substitute for surgical stabilization.  In multidirectional instability patients who have experienced atraumatic [[subluxation]] or dislocation events, cohort studies demonstrate good responses to long-term progressive resistance exercises if judged according to function, pain, stability, and motion scores.<ref name="Rockwood">{{cite journal |pmid=1634579 |year=1992 |last1=Burkhead Jr |first1=WZ |last2=Rockwood Jr |first2=CA |title=Treatment of instability of the shoulder with an exercise program |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=890–6 |journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume}}</ref> However, in those experiencing a discrete traumatic dislocation event, responses to non-operative treatment are less than satisfactory, a pattern that inspired the Matsen and Harryman classification of shoulder instability, TUBS (traumatic, unidirectional, Bankart, and usually requiring surgery) and AMBRI (atraumatic, multidirectional, bilateral, rehabilitation, and occasionally requiring an inferior capsular shift).<ref name="Matsen">{{cite journal |pmid=1934096 |year=1991 |last1=Matsen Fa |first1=3rd |last2=Harryman Dt |first2=2nd |last3=Sidles |first3=JA |title=Mechanics of glenohumeral instability |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=783–8 |journal=Clinics in sports medicine}}</ref> It is thought that traumatic dislocations, as opposed to atraumatic dislocations and instability events, result in a higher incidence of capsuloligamentous injuries that disturb normal anatomy and leave shoulders too structurally compromised to respond to conservative treatment. Pathoanatomic studies of first-time traumatic anterior dislocators reveal a high rate of labral lesions including [[Bankart lesion]]s.<ref name="Owens">{{cite journal |doi=10.2106/JBJS.I.00851 |title=Pathoanatomy of First-Time, Traumatic, Anterior Glenohumeral Subluxation Events |year=2010 |last1=Owens |first1=B.
