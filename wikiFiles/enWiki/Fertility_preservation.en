'''Fertility preservation''' is the effort to help cancer patients retain their [[fertility]], or ability to procreate. Research into how cancer affects reproductive health and preservation options are growing, sparked in part by the increase in the survival rate of cancer patients.

==Indications==
Fertility preservation procedures are indicated when it's predicted that there will be exposure to a cause of [[infertility]], mainly [[cancer treatment]].

===Cancer treatment===

Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer and other serious illnesses can affect reproductive health. The regimens that threaten ovarian and testicular function are mainly [[radiation therapy]] to the pelvic area and some types of [[chemotherapy]]. Chemotherapies with high risk include [[procarbazine]] and [[alkylating drug]]s such as [[cyclophosphamide]], ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and chlormethine.<ref name=Brydoy>{{cite journal |author=Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T |title=Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors |journal=Acta Oncol |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=480–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17497315 |doi=10.1080/02841860601166958 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958}}</ref> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.<ref name=Brydoy/> On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycinand dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluoruracil.<ref name=Brydoy/>

These regimens attack rapidly dividing cells in the body, including healthy cells like [[sperm]] and those belonging to the ovarian follicle (egg). Depending on the dose and duration of administration, these therapies can have varying effects on reproductive health. Surgery involving reproductive tissue affects reproductive function and fertility.

For many cancer patients, the decrease or loss of reproductive function is temporary; many men and women, however, do not regain fertility after cancer treatment. Patients undergoing serious radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery sometimes experience symptoms resembling [[menopause]] (in women) or andropause (in men), which indicate reproductive damage. In women, decreased [[estrogen]] levels as a result of ovarian deficiency lead to weakened bone, changes in temperature control, altered mood, and decreased sexual desire. Men with testicular insufficiency also experience similar symptoms.

A study indicated that fewer oocytes are recovered from cancer patients wanting to perform embryo preservation when compared with an age-matched control group, but the mean number of zygotes generated appears to be similar.<ref name=Klock>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.028}}</ref> The same study found that, of 65 patients referred to the program, 28% declined to undergo embryo, oocyte, or tissue cryopreservation. 9% were found not to be eligible for medical reasons. Of the remaining 41 patients, 85% chose to cryopreserve embryos, 10% chose to cryopreserve oocytes, and 5% chose to undergo ovarian tissue freezing.<ref name=Klock/> No serious clinical sequelae resulted from participation.<ref name=Klock/>

===Aging===
Fertility preservation, such as [[ovarian tissue cryopreservation|ovarian tissue]] or [[oocyte cryopreservation]], may also be used to prevent infertility, as well as [[birth defect]]s, associated with [[advanced maternal age]].

==Methods==
The main methods of fertility preservation are ovarian protection by [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist|GnRH agonists]], [[cryopreservation]] of ovarian tissue, eggs or sperm, or of embryos after in vitro fertilization.<ref name=Cruz>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.055}}</ref> The patient may also choose to use egg or sperm from a donor by [[third party reproduction]] rather than having biological children.

===Semen cryopreservation===
{{See|Semen cryopreservation}}
Men hoping to preserve their fertility before undergoing treatment for cancer or another fertility-threatening disease can cryopreserve, or freeze, their sperm, which can be obtained through [[masturbation]] in post-pubescent boys and men. This is the most established fertility preservation method for males. For pre-pubescent boys, sperm can be obtained through testicular aspiration or electrostimulation and then stored for future use. Researchers are also looking at methods for cryopreserving testicular tissue samples so that they can be re-implanted into the body after treatment.

===Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue or oocytes===
{{See|Oocyte cryopreservation|Ovarian tissue cryopreservation}}
Some female patients choose to have mature eggs extracted and fertilized outside of the body with sperm from a partner or donor. The resulting embryo is then frozen until the woman is in remission from disease. When the woman is ready to initiate pregnancy, the embryo is thawed and implanted into the uterus for maturation and birth. While this option is the most common fertility preservation method in women, it is not available to pre-pubescent girls, who do not have mature eggs that can be fertilized.  Women who do not have a partner will need to use donor sperm. Additionally, because this procedure requires a two-week period of hormonal stimulation to encourage egg maturation, it is not optimal for female patients who are diagnosed with hormone-sensitive cancers (such as [[breast cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]], etc.) or those who cannot delay cancer treatment. Alternative methods of hormonal stimulation using letrozole or tamoxifen may be used for women with hormone-sensitive cancers.

Strips of cortical ovarian tissue can also be cryopreserved, but it must be re-implanted into the body to allow the encapsulated immature follicles to complete their maturation. Furthermore, ovarian tissue is fragile under hard freezing conditions and putting it back into the body carries the risk of re-introducing cancerous cells.

Immature eggs are more tolerant of cryopreservation conditions but still cannot be effectively matured outside of the body. Thus far, this has generated two live births in mice, and scientists are working to translate these methods to humans.

===GnRH agonists===
Ongoing trials are assessing the role of ovarian protection by [[GnRH agonists]].<ref name=Cruz/>

===Third-party reproduction===

Many patients diagnosed with a malignancy or another disease requiring treatment that may impair their fertility consider alternatives to bearing biological children, such as [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) using in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor eggs or donor sperm. The resulting embryo can be implanted into the woman's uterus after her [[endometrium]] (the lining of the uterus) is stimulated with hormones to prepare for the development of the embryo.
