In high-risk areas where vaccination coverage is low, prompt recognition and control of outbreaks through immunization is critical to prevent epidemics. The disease may be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses, especially in the early stages. To confirm any suspicions from the case history and information on the patient's journeys abroad, the doctor must take a blood sample and then insert it through a laser scanner.

The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of female [[mosquito]]es (the yellow fever mosquito, ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', and other species) and is found in [[Tropics|tropic]]al and [[Subtropics|subtropic]]al areas in [[South America]] and [[Africa]], but not in [[Asia]].<ref name="urlCDC Yellow Fever">{{cite web

Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus, a 40 to 50&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide enveloped [[RNA virus]], the type species and namesake of the family [[Flaviviridae]].<ref name="lindenbach2007"/> It was the first illness shown to be transmissible via filtered human serum (i.e. a virus), and transmitted by mosquitoes, by [[Walter Reed]] around 1900.<ref name="staples2008">{{cite journal|last=Staples|first=JE|coauthors=Monath, TP|title=Yellow fever: 100 years of discovery.|journal=JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association|date=2008 Aug 27|volume=300|issue=8|pages=960-2|pmid=18728272}}</ref> The positive [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]] single-stranded [[RNA]] is approximately 11,000 [[nucleotide]]s long and has a single [[open reading frame]] encoding a [[polyprotein]]. [[Host (biology)|Host]] [[protease]]s cut this polyprotein into three structural (C, prM, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5); the enumeration corresponds to the arrangement of the protein coding [[gene]]s in the [[genome]].<ref name="pmid18796313">{{cite journal |author=Sampath A, Padmanabhan R |title=Molecular targets for flavivirus drug discovery |journal=Antiviral Research |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=6–15 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18796313 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.08.004 |url= |pmc=2647018}}</ref>

The viruses infect, amongst others, [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. They attach to the cell surface via specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s and are taken up by an endosomal [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]. Inside the [[endosome]], the decreased [[pH]] induces the fusion of the endosomal membrane with the [[virus envelope]]. Thus, the [[capsid]] reaches the [[cytosol]], decays and releases the genome. Receptor binding as well as membrane fusion are [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by the protein E, which changes its conformation at low pH, which causes a rearrangement of the 90 homo[[protein dimer|dimer]]s to 60 homo[[protein trimer|trimer]]s.<ref name="pmid18796313"/>{{cite journal |author=Sampath A, Padmanabhan R |title=Molecular targets for flavivirus drug discovery |journal=Antiviral Research |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=6–15 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18796313 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.08.004 |url= |pmc=2647018}}

After entering the host cells, the viral genome is replicated in the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) and in the so-called [[Golgi apparatus|vesicle packets]]. At first, an immature form of the virus particle is produced inside the ER, whose M-protein is not yet cleaved to its mature form and is therefore denoted as prM (''precursor M'') and forms a complex with protein E. The immature particles are processed in the [[Golgi apparatus]] by the host protein [[furin]], which cleaves prM to M. This releases E from the complex which can now take its place in the mature, infectious [[virion]].<ref name="pmid18796313"/>

==Transmission==
[[File:Aedes aegypti bloodfeeding CDC Gathany.jpg|thumb|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' feeding]]
[[Image:Aedes aegypti E-A-Goeldi 1905.jpg|thumb| Adults of the yellow fever mosquito ''Aedes aegypti''. The male on the left, females on the right. Only the female mosquito bites can transmit the disease]]

The yellow fever virus is mainly transmitted through the bite of the yellow fever mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', but other mosquitoes such as the "tiger mosquito" (''[[Aedes albopictus]]'') can also serve as a [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the virus. Like other [[Arbovirus]]es which are transmitted via mosquitoes, the yellow fever virus is taken up by a female mosquito which sucks the blood of an infected person or primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect [[epithelial cell]]s and replicate there. From there they reach the [[haemocoel]] (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the [[salivary gland]]s. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and thus the virus reaches the blood of the bitten person. There are also indications for [[Transovarial transmission|transovarial]] and [[transstadial transmission]] of the yellow fever virus within ''A. aegypti'', i.e., the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae. This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems to play a role in single, sudden breakouts of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fontenille | first1 = D | last2 = Diallo | first2 = M | last3 = Mondo | first3 = M | last4 = Ndiaye | first4 = M | last5 = Thonnon | first5 = J | title = First evidence of natural vertical transmission of yellow fever virus in Aedes aegypti, its epidemic vector | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 533–5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9463659 | doi = 10.1016/S0035-9203(97)90013-4 }}</ref>

There are three epidemiologically different infectious cycles,<ref name="pmid16913829"/> in which the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans or other primates. In the "urban cycle," only the yellow fever mosquito ''Aedes aegypti'' is involved. It is well adapted to urban centres and can also transmit other diseases, including [[Dengue]] and [[Chikungunya]]. The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except in an outbreak in 1999 in Bolivia, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America. 

Besides the urban cycle there is, both in Africa and South America, a [[sylvatic cycle]] (forest cycle or [[jungle]] cycle), where ''[[Aedes africanus]]'' (in Africa) or [[mosquito]]es of the [[genus]] ''[[Haemagogus]]'' and ''[[Sabethes]]'' (in South America) serve as a vector. In the jungle, the mosquitoes infect mainly non-human primates; the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates. In South America, the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can infect each other, which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on this continent. People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban centres, where ''Aedes aegypti'' acts as a vector. It is because of this sylvatic cycle that yellow fever cannot be eradicated.<ref name="pmid16913829"/>

In Africa there is a third infectious cycle, also known as "[[savannah]] cycle" or intermediate cycle, which occurs between the jungle and urban cycle. Different mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Aedes]]'' are involved. In recent years, this has been the most common form of transmission of yellow fever in Africa.<ref name="WHO_2001" />

==Pathogenesis==
After transmission of the virus from a mosquito, the viruses replicate in the [[lymph nodes]] and infect [[dendritic cell]]s in particular. From there they reach the liver and infect [[hepatocyte]]s (probably indirectly via [[Kupffer cell]]s), which leads to [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophilic degradation]] of these cells and to the release of [[cytokine]]s. Necrotic masses ([[Councilman body|Councilman bodies]]) appear in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[hepatocyte]]s.<ref name="Sherris"/><ref name="Quaresma_2006">{{cite journal |author=Quaresma JA, Barros VL, Pagliari C, Fernandes ER, Guedes F, Takakura CF, Andrade HF Jr, Vasconcelos PF, Duarte MI |title=Revisiting the liver in human yellow fever: virus-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes associated with TGF-beta, TNF-alpha and NK cells activity |journal=Virology |year=2006 |pages=22–30 |volume=345 |issue=1 |pmid=16278000 |doi=10.1016/j.virol.2005.09.058}}</ref>

When the disease takes a deadly course, a [[cardiovascular]] shock and [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multi-organ failure]], with strongly increased cytokine levels ([[cytokine storm]]), follow.<ref name="pmid18061688"/>

==Diagnosis==
Yellow fever is a clinical [[diagnosis]], which often relies on the whereabouts of the diseased person during the [[incubation time]]. Mild courses of the disease can only be confirmed virologically. Since mild courses of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks, every suspected case of yellow fever (involving symptoms of fever, pain, nausea and vomiting six to ten days after leaving the affected area) has to be treated seriously.

If yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until six to ten days after the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] where the genome of the virus is amplified.<ref name="pmid19327647"/> Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using [[blood plasma]]; this can take one to four weeks.

Serologically, an [[ELISA|enzyme linked immunosorbent assay]] during the acute phase of the disease using specific [[IgM]] against yellow fever or an increase in specific [[IgG]]-[[titer]] (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a fourfold increase in IgG-titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. Since these tests can cross-react with other flaviviruses, like [[Dengue virus]], these indirect methods can never prove yellow fever infection.

Liver [[biopsy]] can verify [[inflammation]] and [[necrosis]] of hepatocytes and detect viral [[antigen]]s. Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients, a biopsy is only advisable ''post mortem'' to confirm the cause of death.

In a [[differential diagnosis]], infections with yellow fever have to be distinguished from other feverish illnesses like [[malaria]]. Other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, such as [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa virus]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Junin virus]], have to be excluded as cause.

==Prevention==
Personal prevention of yellow fever includes vaccination as well as avoidance of mosquito bites in areas where yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever.

===Vaccination===
[[File:Yellow fever certificate.JPG|thumb|The cover of a certificate that confirms that the holder has been vaccinated against yellow fever]]
{{Main|Yellow fever vaccine}}

For journeys into affected areas, vaccination is highly recommended, since mostly non-native people suffer severe cases of yellow fever. The protective effect is established 10 days after vaccination in 95 percent of the vaccinated people<ref name="pmid19520559">{{cite journal | author = Barrett AD, Teuwen DE | title = Yellow fever vaccine – how does it work and why do rare cases of serious adverse events take place? | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 308–13 | year = 2009 | month = June | pmid = 19520559 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2009.05.018 | url = }}</ref> and lasts for at least 10 years (even 30 years later, 81% of patients retained immunity).
The attenuated live [[vaccination|vaccine]] (stem 17D) was developed in 1937 by [[Max Theiler]]<ref name="pmid19520559"/> from a diseased patient in Ghana and is produced in chicken eggs. The WHO recommends routine vaccinations for people living in endemic areas between the 9th and 12th month after birth.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

In about 20% of all cases,<ref name="WHO Supplementary information on vaccine safety">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/DocsPDF00/www562.pdf |title=Supplementary information on vaccine safety |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref> mild, [[flu]]-like symptoms may develop. 

In rare cases (less than one in 200,000 to 300,000<ref name="pmid19520559"/>), the vaccination can cause YEL-AVD (''yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease''), which is fatal in 60% of all cases. It is probably due to a genetic defect in the immune system. But in some vaccination campaigns, a 20-fold higher incidence rate has been reported. Age is an important risk factor; in children, the complication rate is less than one case per 10 million vaccinations.

Another possible side effect is an infection of the nervous system that occurs in one in 200,000 to 300,000 of all cases, causing YEL-AND (''yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease''), which can cause [[meningoencephalitis]] and is fatal in less than 5%<ref name="pmid19520559"/> of all cases.<ref name="pmid19327647"/><ref name="pmid18061688"/>

===Compulsory vaccination===
Some countries in Asia are theoretically in danger of yellow fever epidemics (mosquitoes with the capability to transmit yellow fever and susceptible monkeys are present), although the disease does not yet occur there. To prevent introduction of the virus, some countries demand previous vaccination of foreign visitors if they have passed through yellow fever areas. Vaccination has to be proven in a vaccination certificate which is valid 10 days after the vaccination and lasts for 10 years. A list of the countries that require yellow fever vaccination is published by the WHO.<ref name="urlwww.who.int">{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-07-11
}}</ref> If the vaccination cannot be conducted for some reasons, dispensation may be possible. In this case, an exemption certificate issued by a WHO approved vaccination center is required.

Although 32 of 44 countries where yellow fever occurs endemically do have vaccination programmes, in many of these countries, less than 50% of their population is vaccinated.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

===Vector control===
[[File:Luchemos todos contra el dengue.jpg|thumb|left|Information campaign for prevention of [[dengue]] and yellow fever in [[Paraguay]]]]

Besides vaccination, control of the yellow fever mosquito ''Aedes aegypti'' is of major importance, especially because the same mosquito can also transmit [[dengue]] fever and [[chikungunya]] disease. ''Aedes aegypti'' breeds preferentially in water, for example in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supply, or in domestic waste; especially tires, cans and plastic bottles. Especially in proximity to urban centres of developing countries, these conditions are very common and make a perfect habitat for ''Aedes aegypti''. 

Two strategies are employed to fight the mosquito:
One approach is to kill the developing larva. Measures are taken to reduce water build-up (the habitat of the larva), and [[larvicide]]s are used, as well as larva-eating fish and [[copepod]]s, which reduce the number of larva and thus indirectly the number of disease-transmitting mosquitoes. For many years, copepods of the genus ''[[Mesocyclops]]'' have been used in [[Vietnam]] for fighting [[Dengue]] fever (yellow fever does not occur in Asia). This has resulted in the treated areas with no cases of Dengue fever having occurred since 2001. Similar mechanisms are probably also effective against yellow fever. [[Pyriproxyfen]] is recommended as a chemical larvicide, mainly because it is safe for humans and effective even in small doses.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

The adult yellow fever mosquitoes are also targeted. The curtains and lids of water tanks are sprayed with [[insecticide]]s. Spraying insecticides inside houses is another measure, although it is not recommended by the WHO because of danger to humans. In prevention similar to that against the [[malaria]] carrier, the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito, insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s to protect people in beds have been used successfully against ''Aedes aegypti''.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

==Treatment==
For yellow fever there is, like for all diseases caused by [[Flavivirus]]es, no causative cure. Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. Different methods for acute treatment of the disease have been shown to not be very successful; passive immunisation after emergence of symptoms is probably without effect. [[Ribavirin]] and other [[antiviral drug]]s as well as treatment with [[interferon]]s do not have a positive effect in patients.<ref name="pmid18061688"/>
A symptomatic treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with drugs like [[paracetamol]] (known as [[acetaminophen]] in the United States). [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating in the case of inner bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.

==Epidemiology==

Yellow fever is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Even though the main vector ''Aedes aegypti'' also occurs in Asia, in the [[Pacific]], and in the [[Middle East]], yellow fever does not occur in these areas; the reason for this is unknown. Worldwide there are about 600 million people living in endemic areas.  [[World Health Organization|WHO]] officially estimates that there are 200,000 cases of disease and 30,000 deaths a year; the number of officially reported cases is far lower. An estimated 90% of the infections occur on the African continent.<ref name="pmid19327647">{{cite journal |author=Tolle MA |title=Mosquito-borne diseases |journal=Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=97–140 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19327647 |doi=10.1016/j.cppeds.2009.01.001 |url=}}</ref> In 2008, the largest number of recorded cases were in [[Togo]].

[[Phylogenetic]] analysis identified seven [[genotype]]s of yellow fever viruses, and it is assumed that they are differently adapted to humans and to the vector ''Aedes aegypti''. Five genotypes (Angola, Central/East Africa, East Africa, West Africa I, and West Africa II) occur solely in Africa. West Africa genotype I is found in [[Nigeria]] and the surrounding areas.<ref name=Mutebi2002>{{cite journal | author = Mutebi JP, Barrett AD | year = 2002 | title = The epidemiology of yellow fever in Africa | url = | journal = Microbes Infect | volume = 4 | issue = 14| pages = 1459–1468 | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(02)00028-X | pmid = 12475636 }}</ref> This appears to be especially virulent or infectious as this type is often associated with major outbreaks.

The evolutionary origins of yellow fever most likely lie in Africa, with transmission of the disease from primates to humans.<ref name="pmid14696332">{{cite journal |author=Gould EA, de Lamballerie X, Zanotto PM, Holmes EC |title=Origins, evolution, coadaptations within the genus Flavivirus |journal=Advances in Virus Research |volume=59 |issue= |pages=277–314 |year=2003 |pmid=14696332 |doi= 10.1016/S0065-3527(03)59008-X|url= |series=Advances in Virus Research |isbn=9780120398591}}</ref>
It is thought that the virus originated in East or Central Africa and spread from there to West Africa. As it was endemic in Africa, the natives had developed some immunity to it. When an outbreak of yellow fever would occur in an African village where colonists resided, most Europeans died, while the native population usually suffered nonlethal symptoms resembling [[influenza]].<ref>Oldstone, M. (1998). ''Viruses, Plagues, and History'', New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> This phenomenon, in which certain populations develop immunity to yellow fever due to prolonged exposure in their childhood, is known as acquired immunity.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=J.

The first definitive outbreak of yellow fever was in 1647 on the island of Barbados.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McNeill|first=J.R.|title=Yellow Jack and Geopolitics: Environment, Epidemics, and the Struggles for Empire in the American Tropics, 1650-1825|journal=OAH Magazine of History|year=2004|volume=18|issue=3|pages=11|doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.9}}</ref> An outbreak was recorded by Spanish colonists in 1648 in [[Yucatan]], Mexico, where the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Mayan people]] called the illness ''xekik'' (black vomit).In 1685 Brazil experienced its first epidemic, in Recife.

Although yellow fever is most prevalent in so-called “tropical” climates, the Northern United States was not exempted from the fever.  The first outbreak in English-speaking North America occurred in [[New York]] in 1668 and a serious outbreak afflicted Philadelphia in 1793.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Jacquelyn C|title=The Wages of Blackness: African American Workers and the Meanings of Race during Philadelphia's 1793 Yellow Fever Epidemic|journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|year=2005|volume=129|issue=2|pages=163–194}}</ref>  English colonists in [[Philadelphia]] and the French in the [[Mississippi River Valley]] recorded major outbreaks in 1669, as well as those occurring later in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The southern city of [[New Orleans]] was plagued with major epidemics during the nineteenth century, most notably in 1833 and 1853. At least 25 major outbreaks took place in the Americas throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including particularly serious ones in [[Cartagena, Chile|Cartagena]] in 1741, [[Cuba]] in 1762 and 1900, [[Santo Domingo]] in 1803, and [[Memphis]] in 1878.

Due to yellow fever, in colonial times and during the Napoleonic wars, the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers. Both English and French forces posted there were decimated by the "Yellow Jack". Wanting to regain control of the lucrative sugar trade in [[Saint-Domingue]], and with an eye on regaining France's New World empire, Napoleon sent an army under the command of his brother-in-law to Saint-Domingue  to seize control after a slave revolt. The historian J. R. McNeill asserts that yellow fever accounted for approximately 35,000 to 45,000 casualties during the fighting.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=J.R.|title=Moaquito Empires:Ecology and war in the greater Caribbean, 1620-1914|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=259}}</ref>  Only one-third of the French troops survived for withdrawal and return to France, and in 1804 [[Haiti]] proclaimed its independence as the second republic in the western hemisphere.

The [[Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793|yellow fever epidemic of 1793]] in [[Philadelphia]], which was then the capital of the United States, resulted in the deaths of several thousand people, more than nine percent of the population. The national government fled the city, including president [[George Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Yellow Fever Attacks Philadelphia, 1793 |work=EyeWitness to History |url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/yellowfever.htm |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> Additional yellow fever epidemics in North America struck Philadelphia, as well as [[Baltimore]] and [[New York]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and traveled along steamboat routes of interior rivers from New Orleans. They have caused some 100,000–150,000 deaths in total.<ref>"[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1604377 Yellow fever epidemics and mortality in the United States, 1693–1905.]".

In 1858 [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] suffered 308 yellow fever deaths, reducing the congregation by half.<ref>St. Matthew's Evangelical Lutheran Church: 125 Years of Christian Service, 1967.</ref>  In 1873, [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] lost almost a quarter of its population to yellow fever. In 1878, about 20,000 people died in a widespread epidemic in the Mississippi River Valley.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Molly Caldwell|title=The American Plague|year=2006|publisher=Berkley Publishing Group|location=New York|pages=75}}</ref>  That year, Memphis had an unusually large amount of rain, which led to an increase in the mosquito population. The result was a huge epidemic of yellow fever. The steamship ''John D. Porter''  took people fleeing Memphis northward in hopes of escaping the disease, but passengers were not allowed to disembark due to concerns of spreading yellow fever. The ship roamed the Mississippi River for the next two months before unloading her passengers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=E. |year=2005 |title=Diseases and Human Evolution |location=Albuquerque |publisher=University of New Mexico |isbn=0-8263-3065-7 }}</ref> The last major U.S. outbreak was in 1905 in [[New Orleans]].<ref name="pmid16913829"/>

[[Ezekiel Stone Wiggins]], known as the Ottawa Prophet, proposed that the cause of a Yellow fever epidemic in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in 1888 was astronomical. 
<blockquote>The planets were in the same line as the sun and earth and this produced, besides [[Cyclones]], [[Earthquakes]], etc., a denser atmosphere holding more carbon and creating microbes. [[Mars]] had an uncommonly dense atmosphere, but its inhabitants were probably protected from the fever by their newly discovered [[Mars canals|canals]], which were perhaps made to absorb carbon and prevent the disease. <ref>[http://historicaltextarchive.com/print.php?action=section&artid=781 John W. Cowart, "Yellow Jack in Jacksonville, Yellow Fever visited Duval County, Florida in 1888"], Historical Text Archive</ref></blockquote>

[[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor and scientist, first proposed in 1881 that yellow fever might be transmitted by [[mosquito]]es rather than direct human contact.<ref>Carlos Juan Finlay (presented:  August 14, 1881 ; published:  1882) [http://books.google.com/books?id=cMMYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false "El mosquito hipoteticamente considerado como agente de trasmision de la fiebre amarilla"] (The mosquito hypothetically considered as an agent in the transmission of yellow fever) ''Anales de la Real Academia de Ciencias Médicas, Físicas y Naturales de la Habana'', '''18''' : 147-169.

They successfully proved Finlay's ″Mosquito Hypothesis″. Yellow fever was the first virus shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The physician [[William Gorgas]] applied these insights and eradicated yellow fever from [[Havana]]. He also campaigned against yellow fever during the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], after a previous construction effort on the part of the French failed (in part due to the high incidence of yellow fever and [[malaria]], which decimated the workers).<ref name="pmid16913829"/>  

Although Dr. Reed has received much of the credit in American history books for "beating" yellow fever, Reed had fully credited Dr. Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector, and how it might be controlled. Dr. Reed often cited Finlay's papers in his own articles and also gave him credit for the discovery in his personal correspondence.<ref name="pierce">Pierce J.R., J, Writer. 2005.

The Rockefeller Foundation’s International Health Board (IHB) undertook an expensive and successful yellow fever eradication campaign in Mexico during 1920-1923. The IHB gained the respect of Mexico’s federal government because of the success. The eradication of yellow fever strengthened the relationship between the US and Mexico, which had not been very good in the past. The eradication of yellow fever was a major step toward better global health.<ref>Birn, Anne-Emanuelle, and Armando Solórzano. 1999. "Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s"], ''Social Science & Medicine'' 49 (9):1197-1213</ref>

In 1927, scientists isolated the yellow fever virus in West Africa, which led to the development of two [[vaccine]]s in the 1930s. The vaccine 17D was developed by the [[South Africa]]n microbiologist [[Max Theiler]] at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]].This vaccine was widely used by the U.S. Army during World War II.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McNeill|first=J. R.|title=Yellow Jack and Geopolitics: Environment, Epidemics, and the Struggles for Empire in the American Tropics, 1650-1825|journal=OAH Magazine of History|year=2004|volume=18|issue=3|pages=10|doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.9}}</ref>  Following the work of [[Ernest Goodpasture]], he used chicken eggs to culture the virus and won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1951 for this achievement. A French team developed the vaccine FNV (''French neurotropic vaccine''), which was extracted from mouse brain tissue but, since it was associated with a higher incidence of [[encephalitis]], after 1961 FNV was not recommended. 17D is still in use and more than 400 million doses have been distributed. Little research has been done to develop new vaccines. Some researchers worry that the 60-year-old technology for vaccine production may be too slow to stop a major new yellow fever epidemic. Newer vaccines, based on [[vero cell]]s, are in development and should replace 17D at some point.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

Using vector control and strict vaccination programs, the urban cycle of yellow fever was nearly eradicated from South America. Since 1943 only a single urban outbreak in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]] has occurred. But, since the 1980s, the number of yellow fever cases have been increasing again and ''A. aegypti'' has returned to the urban centers of South America. This is partly due to limitations on available insecticides, as well as habitat dislocations caused by climate change, and partly because the vector control program was abandoned. Although no new urban cycle has yet been established, scientists fear that this could happen again at any point. An outbreak in [[Paraguay]] in 2008 was feared to be urban in nature, but this ultimately proved not to be the case.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

In Africa, virus eradication programs have mostly relied upon vaccination. These programs have largely been unsuccessful, since they were unable to break the [[sylvatic cycle]] involving wild primates. With few countries establishing regular vaccination programs, measures to fight yellow fever have been neglected, making the virus a dangerous threat to spread again.<ref name="pmid19327647"/>

==Research==
In the hamster model of yellow fever, early administration of the antiviral [[ribavirin]] is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease.<ref name="Sbrana_2004">{{cite journal |author=Sbrana E, Xiao SY, Guzman H, Ye M, Travassos da Rosa AP, Tesh RB |title=Efficacy of post-exposure treatment of yellow fever with ribavirin in a hamster model of the disease |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |year=2004 |pages=306–12 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pmid=15381811 }}</ref> Ribavirin treatment during the first five days after virus infection improved survival rates, reduced tissue damage in target organs (liver and spleen), prevented hepatocellular [[steatosis]], and normalised alanine aminotransferase (a liver damage marker) levels.
