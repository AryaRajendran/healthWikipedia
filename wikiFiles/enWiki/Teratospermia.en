'''Teratospermia''' or '''teratozoospermia''' is a condition characterized by the presence of sperm with abnormal morphology that affects fertility in males.

==Causes==
The causes of teratospermia are unknown in most cases. However, Hodgkin's disease, coeliac disease, and Crohn's disease may contribute in some instances.<ref>http://www.gfmer.ch/Endo/Lectures_09/dupan1.htm</ref>

In cases of '''globozoospermia''' (sperm with round heads), the [[Golgi apparatus]] is not transformed into the [[acrosome]] that is needed for [[fertilization]].<ref>Page 155 in: {{cite book |author=Hermann Behre; Eberhard Nieschlag |title=Andrology : Male Reproductive Health and Dysfunction |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=3-540-67224-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Symptoms and treatment==
The presence of abnormally-shaped sperm can negatively affect fertility by reducing sperm motility and/or preventing sperm from adhering to the [[ovum]]. Achieving a pregnancy may be difficult.<ref name="gfmer.ch">http://www.gfmer.ch/Endo/Lectures_09/dupan.htm</ref>

In testing for teratospermia, sperm are collected and analyzed under a microscope to detect abnormalities. These abnormalities may include heads that are large, small, tapered, or pyriform or tails that are abnormally shaped.<ref>http://www.endotext.org/male/male7/male7_2.htm</ref>

Antiestrogens have been shown to be effective in the treatment of teratospermia. <ref name="gfmer.ch"/>
