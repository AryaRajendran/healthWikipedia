'''Mitral stenosis''' is a [[valvular heart disease]] characterized by the narrowing of the orifice of the [[mitral valve]] of the [[heart]].<ref name="pmid16027271">{{cite journal |pages=432–7 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.532498 |title=Modern Management of Mitral Stenosis |year=2005 |last1=Carabello |first1=B. A. |journal=Circulation |volume=112 |issue=3 |pmid=16027271}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of mitral stenosis include:
*[[Heart failure]] symptoms, such as [[dyspnea on exertion]], [[orthopnea]] and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]] (PND)<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
*[[Palpitations]]<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
*[[Chest pain]]<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
*[[Hemoptysis]]<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
*[[Thromboembolism]]<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> in later stages when the left atrial volume is increased (i.e. dilation). The latter leads to increase risk of atrial fibrillation of which increases the risk of blood stasis (motionless). This increases the risk of coagulation.
*[[Ascites]] and [[edema]] and hepatomegaly (if right-sided [[heart failure]] develops)<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
Symptoms increase with exercise and pregnancy<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>
* Fatigue
* wasting (weakness)

==Cause==

Almost all cases of mitral stenosis are due to disease in the heart secondary to [[rheumatic fever]] and the consequent [[rheumatic heart disease]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1>Chapter 1: Diseases of the Cardiovascular system > Section: Valvular Heart Disease in: {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlMitral Stenosis: Heart Valve Disorders: Merck Manual Home Edition">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec03/ch028/ch028d.html |title=Mitral Stenosis: Heart Valve Disorders: Merck Manual Home Edition |work= |accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Uncommon causes of mitral stenosis are [[calcification]] of the mitral valve leaflets, and as a form of [[congenital heart disease]]. However, there are primary causes of mitral stenosis that emanate from a cleft [[mitral valve]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Other causes include [[infective endocarditis]] where the vegetations may favor increase risk of stenosis. It is the most common valvular heart disease in [[pregnancy]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39365.655833.AE |title=Valvular heart disease |year=2007 |last1=Gelson |first1=E |last2=Gatzoulis |first2=M |last3=Johnson |first3=M |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7628 |pages=1042–5 |pmid=18007005 |pmc=2078629}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Mitral stenosis pressure tracings.png|thumb|Intracardiac pressure measurements in an individual with severe mitral stenosis. Pressure tracings in the left atrium (LA) and the left ventricle (LV) in an individual with severe mitral stenosis. Blue areas represent the diastolic pressure gradient due to the stenotic valve.]]
The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is about 4 to 6&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>. In normal cardiac physiology, the [[mitral valve]] opens during [[left ventricle|left ventricular]] [[diastole]], to allow [[blood]] to flow from the [[left atrium]] to the [[left ventricle]]. A normal mitral valve will not impede the flow of blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle during (ventricular) diastole, and the pressures in the left atrium and the left ventricle during ventricular diastole will be equal.  The result is that the left ventricle gets filled with blood during early ventricular diastole, with only a small portion of extra blood contributed by contraction of the left atrium (the "atrial kick") during late ventricular diastole.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

When the mitral valve area goes below 2&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>, the valve causes an impediment to the flow of blood into the left ventricle, creating a pressure gradient across the mitral valve.  This gradient may be increased by increases in the [[heart rate]] or [[cardiac output]].  As the gradient across the mitral valve increases, the amount of time necessary to fill the left ventricle with blood increases.  Eventually, the left ventricle requires the atrial kick to fill with blood.  As the heart rate increases, the amount of time that the ventricle is in diastole and can fill up with blood (called the diastolic filling period) decreases.  When the heart rate goes above a certain point, the diastolic filling period is insufficient to fill the ventricle with blood and pressure builds up in the left atrium, leading to pulmonary congestion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

When the mitral valve area goes less than 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>, there will be an increase in the left atrial pressures (required to push blood through the stenotic valve). Since the normal left ventricular diastolic pressures is about 5 mmHg, a pressure gradient across the mitral valve of 20 mmHg due to severe mitral stenosis will cause a left atrial pressure of about 25 mmHg. This left atrial pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature and causes [[pulmonary hypertension]].  Pulmonary [[capillary]] pressures in this level cause an imbalance between the [[hydrostatic pressure]] and the [[oncotic pressure]], leading to extravasation of fluid from the vascular tree and pooling of fluid in the lungs ([[congestive heart failure]] causing [[pulmonary edema]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The constant pressure overload of the left atrium will cause the left atrium to increase in size.  As the left atrium increases in size, it becomes more prone to develop [[atrial fibrillation]].  When atrial fibrillation develops, the atrial kick is lost (since it is due to the normal atrial contraction).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In individuals with severe mitral stenosis, the left ventricular filling is dependent on the atrial kick.  The loss of the atrial kick due to atrial fibrillation can cause a precipitous decrease in cardiac output and sudden congestive heart failure.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Patients with mitral stenosis prompts a series of hemodynamic changes that frequently cause deterioration of the patient's clinical status. A reduction in cardiac output, associated with acceleration of heart rate and shortening of the diastolic time, frequently leads to congestive heart failure. In addition, when AF sets in, systemic embolization becomes a real danger.<ref>American Heart Journal{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

Mitral stenosis typically progresses slowly (over decades) from the initial signs of mitral stenosis to [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA functional class]] II symptoms to the development of atrial fibrillation to the development of NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms.  Once an individual develops NYHA class III or IV symptoms, the progression of the disease accelerates and the patient's condition deteriorates.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Diagnosis==
===Physical examination===
[[Image:Phonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png|thumb|Phonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds]]
Upon [[heart sounds|auscultation]] of an individual with mitral stenosis, the [[first heart sound]] is unusually loud and may be palpable (tapping [[apex beat]]) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first heart sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1 respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It may be the most prominent sign.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>

If [[pulmonary hypertension]] secondary to mitral stenosis is severe, the P<sub>2</sub> (pulmonic) component of the [[second heart sound]] (S<sub>2</sub>) will become loud.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

An opening snap which is a high pitched additional sound may be heard after the A<sub>2</sub> (aortic) component of the second heart sound (S<sub>2</sub>), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve.  The mitral valve opens when the pressure in the left atrium is greater than the pressure in the left ventricle.  This happens in ventricular [[diastole]] (after closure of the [[aortic valve]]), when the pressure in the ventricle precipitously drops.  In individuals with mitral stenosis, the pressure in the left atrium correlates with the severity of the mitral stenosis.  As the severity of the mitral stenosis increases, the pressure in the left atrium increases, and the mitral valve opens earlier in ventricular diastole.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>

A mid-diastolic rumbling [[heart murmur|murmur]] with presystolic accentuation will be heard after the opening snap.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/><ref name=uas/> The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is low-pitched it is heard best with the [[Stethoscope bell|bell of the stethoscope]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> Its duration increases with worsening disease.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> Rolling the patient towards left, as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Advanced disease may present with signs of [[right-sided heart failure]] such as [[parasternal heave]], [[jugular venous distension]], [[hepatomegaly]], [[ascites]] and/or [[pulmonary hypertension]], the latter often presenting with a loud [[Heart sounds#P2|P<sub>2</sub>]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>

Almost all signs increase with exercise and pregnancy.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>

Other peripheral signs include:
* [[Malar flush]] - due to back pressure and build up of carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is a natural vasodilator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/cardiovascular_disorders/valvular_disorders/mitral_stenosis.html?qt=malar%20flush&sc=&alt=sh |title=Mitral Stenosis: Valvular Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}</ref>
* [[Atrial fibrillation]] - irregular pulse and loss of 'a' wave in jugular venous pressure
* Left [[parasternal heave]] - presence of right ventricular hypertrophy due to pulmonary hypertension
* Tapping apex beat which is not displaced

[[Medical sign]]s of [[atrial fibrillation]] include:{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Heart rate is about 100-150/min.
Irregularly irregular pulse with a pulse deficit>10.
varying first heart sound intensity.
Opening snap is not heard sometimes.
Absent a waves in the neck veins.
Presystolic accentuation of diastolic murmur disappears.
Embolic manifestations may appear.

In most cases, the diagnosis of mitral stenosis is most easily made by '''[[echocardiography]]''', which shows left atrial enlargement, thick and calcified mitral valve with narrow and "fish-mouth"-shaped orifice and signs of [[right ventricular failure]] in advanced disease.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> It can also show decreased opening of the mitral valve leaflets, and increased blood flow velocity during [[diastole]]. The trans-mitral gradient as measured by Doppler echocardiography is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] in the evaluation of the severity of mitral stenosis.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Cardiac chamber catheterization===
Another method of measuring the severity of mitral stenosis is the simultaneous left and right [[heart chamber catheterization]]. The right heart catheterization (commonly known as [[Swan-Ganz catheterization]]) gives the physician the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is a reflection of the left atrial pressure.  The left heart catheterization, on the other hand, gives the pressure in the left ventricle.  By simultaneously taking these pressures, it is possible to determine the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during ventricular [[diastole]], which is a marker for the severity of mitral stenosis.  This method of evaluating mitral stenosis tends to overestimate the degree of mitral stenosis, however, because of the time lag in the pressure tracings seen on the right heart catheterization and the slow Y descent seen on the wedge tracings.  If a trans-septal puncture is made during right heart catheterization, however, the pressure gradient can accurately quantify the severity of mitral stenosis.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Other assisting diagnostic techniques===
[[Chest X-ray]] may also assist in diagnosis, showing [[left atrial enlargement]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>

[[Electrocardiography]] may show ''P mitrale'', that is, broad, notched P waves in several or many leads with a prominent late negative component to the P wave in lead V<sub>1</sub>, and may also be seen in [[mitral regurgitation]], and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium.<ref name=stedmans>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=70229 medilexicon.com < P mitrale] Citing. Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Copyright 2006</ref> Thus, ''P-sinistrocardiale'' may be a more appropriate term.<ref name=stedmans/>

==Natural history==
The natural history of mitral stenosis secondary to [[rheumatic fever]] (the most common cause) is an asymptomatic latent phase following the initial episode of rheumatic fever.  This latent period lasts an average of 16.3 ± 5.2 years.  Once symptoms of mitral stenosis begin to develop, progression to severe disability takes 9.2 ± 4.3 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In individuals who were offered mitral valve surgery but refused, ''survival'' with medical therapy alone was 44 ± 6% at 5 years, and 32 ± 8% at 10 years after they were offered correction.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Treatment==
Treatment is not necessary in asymptomatic patients.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>

The treatment options for mitral stenosis include medical management, [[mitral valve replacement]] by surgery, and [[percutaneous]] mitral valvuloplasty by [[balloon catheter]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The indication for invasive treatment with either a mitral valve replacement or valvuloplasty is [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA functional class]] III or IV symptoms.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Another option is balloon dilatation.<ref name="pmid3190958">{{cite journal |pages=299–308 |doi=10.1136/hrt.60.4.299 |title=Percutaneous balloon dilatation of the mitral valve: An analysis of echocardiographic variables related to outcome and the mechanism of dilatation |year=1988 |last1=Wilkins |first1=G T |last2=Weyman |first2=A E |last3=Abascal |first3=V M |last4=Block |first4=P C |last5=Palacios |first5=I F |journal=Heart |volume=60 |issue=4}}</ref> To determine which patients would benefit from percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty, a scoring system has been developed. Scoring is based on 4 [[echocardiogram|echocardiographic]] criteria: leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, subvalvar thickening, and calcification.  Individuals with a score of ≥ 8 tended to have suboptimal results.<ref name="pmid2372892">{{cite journal |pages=448–56 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.82.2.448 |title=Prediction of successful outcome in 130 patients undergoing percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy |year=1990 |last1=Abascal |first1=V.

C. |journal=Circulation |volume=82 |issue=2 |pmid=2372892}}</ref>  Superb results with valvotomy are seen in individuals with a crisp opening snap, score < 8, and no calcium in the commissures.

Treatment also focuses on concomitant conditions often seen in mitral stenosis:
*Any angina is treated with short-acting [[nitrovasodilator]]s, [[beta-blocker]]s and/or [[calcium blocker]]s<ref name=uas>VOC=VITIUM ORGANICUM CORDIS, a compendium of the Department of Cardiology at Uppsala Academic Hospital. By Per Kvidal September 1999, with revision by Erik Björklund May 2008</ref>
*Any [[hypertension]] is treated aggressively, but caution must be taken in administering [[beta-blocker]]s<ref name=uas/>
*Any [[heart failure]] is treated with [[digoxin]], [[diuretic]]s, [[nitrovasodilator]]s and, if not contraindicated, cautious inpatient administration of [[ACE inhibitor]]s<ref name=uas/>

===Mitral valvuloplasty===
Mitral valvuloplasty is a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure to correct an uncomplicated mitral stenosis by dilating the valve using a balloon.
Under [[local anaesthetic]], a catheter with a special balloon is passed from the right [[femoral vein]], up the [[inferior vena cava]] and into the [[right atrium]]. The [[interatrial septum]] is punctured and the [[catheter]] passed into the left atrium using a "trans-septal technique." The balloon is sub-divided into 3 segments and is dilated in 3 stages. 1st the [[distal]] portion (lying in the left ventricle) is inflated and pulled against the valve cusps. Second the proximal portion is dilated, in order to fix the centre segment at the valve orifice. Finally, the central section is inflated, this should take no longer than 30 seconds since full inflation obstructs the valve and causes congestion, leading to circulatory arrest and flash [[pulmonary edema]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

With careful patient pre-selection, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is associated with good success rates and a low rate of complications. By far the most serious adverse event is the occurrence of acute severe mitral regurgitation.  Severe mitral regurgitation usually results from a tear in one of the valve leaflets or the subvalvular apparatus. It can lead to pulmonary oedema and hemodynamic compromise, necessitating urgent surgical mitral valve replacement.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Other serious complications with PBMV usually relate to the technique of trans-septal puncture (TSP). The ideal site for TSP is the region of the fossa ovalis in the inter-atrial septum. Occasionally, however, the sharp needle used for TSP may inadvertently traumatize other cardiac structures, leading to cardiac tamponade or serious blood loss.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although the immediate results of PBMV are often quite gratifying, the procedure does not provide permanent relief from mitral stenosis. Regular follow-up is mandatory, to detect restenosis.  Long-term follow up data from patients undergoing PBMV indicates that up to 70-75% individuals can be free of restenosis 10 years following the procedure. The number falls to about 40% 15 years post-PBMV.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17944115 |year=2007 |last1=Fawzy |first1=ME |last2=Shoukri |first2=M |last3=Al Buraiki |first3=J |last4=Hassan |first4=W |last5=El Widaal |first5=H |last6=Kharabsheh |first6=S |last7=Al Sanei |first7=A |last8=Canver |first8=C |title=Seventeen years' clinical and echocardiographic follow up of mitral balloon valvuloplasty in 520 patients, and predictors of long-term outcome |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=454–60 |journal=The Journal of heart valve disease}}</ref>
