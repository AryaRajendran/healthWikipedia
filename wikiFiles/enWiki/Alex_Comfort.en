'''Alexander Comfort''', [[MB BChir]], [[PhD]], [[DSc]] (10 February 1920&nbsp;– 26 March 2000) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and physician best known for his 1972&nbsp;[[Sexual revolution#Nonfiction sex manuals|nonfiction sex manual]], ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. He was an author of both fiction and nonfiction, as well as a [[gerontologist]], [[anarchist]], [[pacifist]], and [[conscientious objector]].

==Early life and education==
Comfort was educated at [[Highgate School]] in [[London]]. While a student there, he was convinced that he could come up with a superior concoction of [[gunpowder]]. In the course of his experiments, he ended up blowing up his left hand, of which only the thumb remained. (Later in life, he claimed that his left hand proved "very useful for performing [[uterine inversion]]s".) This story is pointed to as evidence of his single-mindedness.<ref name=newyorker>{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Ariel|title=Doing It: A new edition of "The Joy of Sex."|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/01/05/090105crbo_books_levy?currentPage=all|accessdate=2 July 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=5 January 2009}}</ref>

He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to study medicine. (pre-clinical study leading to a BA, upgraded in 1944 to an MA) and the London Hospital (now known as the [[Royal London Hospital]]), qualifying in 1944 with both the [[Conjoint]] diplomas of [[Royal College of Physicians]]&nbsp;(LRCP) London, [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons]]&nbsp;(MRCS) England and the Cambridge [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB BChir]] degrees. All in all, he accrued six degrees.

==Life and work==
Comfort served as a House Physician at the [[London Hospital]] and went on to become a lecturer in physiology at the London Hospital Medical College. In 1945 he obtained the Conjoint Board's Diploma in Child Health, and progressed to a PhD in 1950 and a DSc of [[University College, London]] in 1963.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Medical Directory 1969 |publisher = J & A Churchill | year = 1969 | location = London | edition = 125 | page = 356 | isbn = 7000-1400-4 |postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

A leading pacifist, Comfort considered himself "an aggressive anti-militarist", and he believed that pacifism rested "solely upon the historical theory of anarchism".<ref name="Obituaries">{{cite news | last = Rayner | first = Claire | title = News: Obituaries: Alex Comfort | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 28 March 2000  | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2000/mar/28/guardianobituaries | accessdate = 2008-08-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080918054049/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2000/mar/28/guardianobituaries| archivedate= 18 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>For discussions of Comfort's political views, see ''Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism'' (1992) by [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], and ''Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow'' (2006) by [[David Goodway]].</ref> He was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]]&nbsp;(PPU) and [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and a [[conscientious objector]] in [[World War&nbsp;II]]. In 1951 Comfort was a signatory of the 
[[Authors’ World Peace Appeal]], but later resigned from its
committee, claiming the AWPA had become dominated by Soviet sympathisers. <ref>Carissa Honeywell, 
''A British Anarchist Tradition: Herbert Read, Alex Comfort and Colin Ward'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011
ISBN 1441190171  (p.112). </ref> Later in the decade he actively supported both the [[Direct Action Committee against Nuclear War]] when the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] was formed, Comfort was
imprisoned for a month, alongside [[Bertrand Russell]] and others, for refusing to be bound over not to take part in the Trafalgar Square protest in September 1961.

Among the works on anarchism by Comfort is ''Peace and Disobedience'' (1946), one of many pamphlets he wrote for [[Peace News]] and PPU, and [http://AlexComfort.com/Authority.html ''Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State''] (1950).<ref name="Obituaries"/> He exchanged public correspondence with [[George Orwell]] defending pacifism in the open letter/poem, "Letter to an American Visitor", under the [[pseudonym]] "Obadiah Hornbrooke".<ref name="obadiah">''Complete Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' volume II, pg. 294-303</ref>

Comfort's 1972 book ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' earned him worldwide fame and $3&nbsp;million. But he was unhappy to become known as "Dr.&nbsp;Sex" and to have his other works given so little attention.<ref>{{cite news | last = Martin | first = Douglas | title = Alex Comfort, 80, Dies; a Multifaceted Man Best Known for Writing 'The Joy of Sex' | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = 20 March 2000  | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DD173CF93AA15750C0A9669C8B63 | accessdate = 2008-08-23}}</ref>

Comfort devoted much of the 1950s and 1960s studying the biology of aging ([[Gerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontology]]) and popularized the subject. He could be called an early biomedical gerontologist ([[life extension]]ist) on the basis of his view that science could extend human lifespan. In 1969 he suggested that [[life expectancy]] (not simply [[maximum life span]]) could be extended to 120 years of age within the next 20&nbsp;years.<ref name="Obituaries"/> Although Comfort believed that aging could be postponed, he did not believe that it could be eliminated, and he did not write about [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Gerontology A Good Age by Alex Comfort | publisher = Trivia-Library.com  | date = 1975 - 1981 | url = http://www.trivia-library.com/b/gerontology-a-good-age-by-alex-comfort.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080720020906/http://www.trivia-library.com/b/gerontology-a-good-age-by-alex-comfort.htm| archivedate= 20 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Personal life==

''The Joys of Sex'' made Comfort internationally known as “Dr.&nbsp;Sex” and shortly thereafter he and his wife of thirty years [[divorce]]d. A few months later, in 1973, Comfort married his mistress (and ex-wife's best friend) Jane Henderson, with whom he had been having an affair for more than a decade. (The illustrations in ''The Joys of Sex'' were based on [[Instant film|Polaroids]] that Comfort and Henderson had taken and given to the publisher.) The [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], a liberal [[think tank]], offered Comfort a job, so the couple moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where it was located.<ref name=newyorker />

They frequented [[Sandstone retreat|Sandstone]], a clothing-optional community. In his 1981 nonfiction on sexuality in America, ''[[Thy Neighbor's Wife]]'', [[Gay Talese]] noted, "Often the nude biologist Dr.&nbsp;Alex Comfort, brandishing a cigar, traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the professional air of a [[lepidopterist]] strolling through the fields waving a butterfly net”.<ref name=newyorker />

Jane Henderson, however, eventually grew tired of the "open love" community and Comfort became involved in lawsuits with his employer over a claimed [[breach of contract]]. In 1985, the couple returned to England, where they lived out the remainder of their lives in [[Kent]]. In 1991, Comfort suffered a severe [[cerebral hemorrhage]], after which his son from his first marriage acted as caretaker and business manager. His second wife Jane Henderson died shortly after the hemorrhage. He died on 26&nbsp;March&nbsp;2000; he was eighty years old.<ref name=newyorker />
