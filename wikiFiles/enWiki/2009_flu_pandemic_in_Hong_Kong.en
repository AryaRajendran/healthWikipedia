==Initial response==
Following news of the flu outbreak in Mexico and the [[United States]], on 26 April, [[Secretary for Food and Health]] [[York Chow]] announced that Hong Kong had raised its [[influenza pandemic]] alertness level to "serious",<ref name="ChowAnnounce">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/healthandcommunity/090426/html/090426en05004.htm|title=Swine flu alert raised to 'serious'|publisher=[[Information Services Department]]|date=2009-04-26|accessdate=2009-08-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> out of three possible alertness levels: alert, serious, and emergency.<ref name="PreparednessPlan">{{cite web|url=http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/flu_plan_framework_en_20050222.pdf|title=Framework of Government's Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic|publisher=[[Centre for Health Protection]]|month=July|year=2007|accessdate=2009-08-27|format=PDF}}</ref> Hong Kong also became one of the first jurisdictions to declare swine flu as a [[notifiable disease]], and much of the procedures against the spread of the swine flu were learned from the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|2003 SARS outbreak]], of which Hong Kong was the epicenter of the outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/425512/1/.html|title=HK steps up SARS-like emergency precautions against swine flu |last=Tang|first=Leslie|date=April 28, 2009|publisher=Channel News Asia|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref><ref name="TimeTheLessonsFromSARS">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1894072,00.html?iid=tsmodule|title=The Lessons from SARS |last=Webley|first=Kayla|date=April 27, 2009|publisher=Time|accessdate=2009-04-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090430111642/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1894072,00.html?iid=tsmodule| archivedate= 30 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Chow advised Hong Kong residents to avoid travelling to cities facing an outbreak of the flu, and stated that swine flu has been added to the list of [[notifiable disease]], which required cases of the flu to be reported to the government. Residents were also advised to take precautionary measures against infection if travel to affected areas was necessary. Surveillance measures at boundary control points were boosted to detect travellers with fever and respiratory symptoms, and travellers who were suspected of being infected would be quarantined and monitored.<ref name="ChowAnnounce" />

==First case==
On 1 May, [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]] told reporters that tests performed by the [[Department of Health (Hong Kong)|Department of Health]] and the [[University of Hong Kong]] confirmed that a 25-year old Mexican citizen who had traveled to the city via Shanghai on a [[China Eastern Airlines]] flight was infected with swine flu.<ref name="Guardian0501" /><ref name="Telegraph0501">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/5260131/Swine-flu-300-quarantined-in-Hong-Kong-hotel-for-a-week.html|title=Swine flu: 300 quarantined in Hong Kong hotel for a week|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2009-05-01|accessdate=2009-08-27 | location=London}}</ref> In light of this, Tsang raised Hong Kong's influenza pandemic alertness level to "emergency" from "serious". This first confirmed case of swine flu in Hong Kong was also the first confirmed case in Asia. The man had developed a fever after arriving in Hong Kong, and was then isolated in [[Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong|Princess Margaret Hospital]], the hospital designated to handle swine flu cases.<ref name="Standard0501">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=14104|title=Mexican traveler is HK's first swine flu case|publisher=[[The Standard]]|date=2009-05-01|accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> The hotel where the traveller had stayed, the Metropark Hotel in [[Wanchai]],<ref name="CNN0504">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/04/hk.flu.hotel/index.html|title=1 swine flu case leads to 340 quarantines in Hong Kong|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Elizabeth Yuan|date=2009-05-04|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> was quarantined and about 200 guests and 100 staff were instructed to remain in the hotel for seven days regardless of whether or not they had come into contact with the traveller.<ref name="Telegraph0501" /> Authorities also made an effort to track down anybody who had made contact with the traveller, with Chow appealing to those who were on the same flight as the traveller to contact health officials.<ref name="Standard0502">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=13996|title=Battle stations as Mexican brings swine flu to HK|publisher=[[The Standard]]|date=2009-05-02|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>

The guests and staff were released on 8 May, when the quarantine expired. Tsang was at the hotel for the release, speaking to reporters and with those who had been quarantined. To compensate for the quarantine, the government offered guests two free nights of accommodation at other hotels in Hong Kong. The Mexican traveller was also discharged after treatment with the antiviral drug [[Tamiflu]] and the [[Centre for Health Protection]] confirmed that he was no longer carrying the virus.<ref name="Bloomberg0508">{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aO8D7j8zVdWA|title=Hong Kong Lifts Swine Flu Quarantine on 351 People|author=Sophie Leung|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>

==School closure==
Following the finding that 12 students at [[St. Paul's Convent School]] contracted the swine flu virus, Chief Executive Donald Tsang ordered the closure of all primary schools, kindergartens, and special schools for two weeks starting from 12 June. The 12 cases of infection were confirmed to be the first known cluster of local transmission of the virus. According to the [[Education Bureau]], the school closure affected about 500,000 students from 964 kindergartens, 601 primary schools and 61 special schools.<ref name="TheStandardSiu0612">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&art_id=83402&sid=24194209&con_type=3&d_str=20090612&fc=8|title=Tough action on lessons backed by principals|author=Beatrice Siu|publisher=[[The Standard]]|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref><ref name="TheStandardMoy0612">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&art_id=83401&sid=24199340&con_type=3&d_str=20090612&fc=8|title=Pandemic ... but don't panic|author=Patsy Moy|publisher=[[The Standard]]|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref>
