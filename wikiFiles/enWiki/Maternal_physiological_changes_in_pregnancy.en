'''Maternal physiological changes in pregnancy''' are the normal adaptations that a woman undergoes during [[pregnancy]] to better accommodate the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]]. They are [[physiology|physiological]] changes, that is, they are entirely normal, and include [[cardiovascular]], [[hematology|hematologic]], [[metabolism|metabolic]], [[renal]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] changes that become very important in the event of complications. The body must change its physiological and homeostatic mechanisms in pregnancy to ensure the fetus is provided for. Increases in blood sugar, breathing and cardiac output are all required. Levels of progesterone and estrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the hypothalamic axis and subsequently the menstrual cycle. The woman and the placenta also produce many hormones.

==Hormonal==
Pregnant women experience adjustments in their [[endocrine system]].

Levels of progesterone and estrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the hypothalamic axis and subsequently the menstrual cycle. [[Estrogen]] is mainly produced by the [[placenta]] and is associated with fetal well&ndash;being. Women also experience increased [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (β-hCG); which is produced by the placenta. This maintains [[progesterone]] production by the [[corpus luteum]]. The increased progesterone production, first by corpus luteum and later by the placenta, mainly functions to relax smooth muscle.

[[Prolactin]] levels increase due to maternal [[pituitary gland]] enlargement by 50%. This mediates a change in the structure of the [[mammary gland]] from ductal to lobular-alveolar. [[Parathyroid hormone]] is increased which leads to increases of calcium uptake in the gut and reabsorption by the kidney. Adrenal hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]] also increase.

[[Human placental lactogen]] (hPL) is produced by the placenta and stimulates lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism by the woman, conserving blood glucose for use by the fetus. It can also decrease maternal tissue sensitivity to insulin, resulting in [[gestational diabetes]].<ref name="Gestational Diabetes in Primary Care: Diabetes in Pregnancy, Medscape">{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408910_2 |title=Gestational Diabetes in Primary Care: Diabetes in Pregnancy, Medscape |accessdate=2011-06-22 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Musculoskeletal==
The body's posture changes as the pregnancy progresses. The pelvis tilts and the back arches to help keep balance. Poor posture occurs naturally from the stretching of the woman's abdominal muscles as the fetus grows. These muscles are less able to contract and keep the lower back in proper alignment. The pregnant woman has a different pattern of gait. The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses, due to weight gain and changes in posture. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention, and weight gain lowers the arches of the foot, further adding to the foot's length and width. The influences of increased hormones such as [[estrogen]] and [[relaxin]] initiate the remodeling of soft tissues, cartilage and ligaments. Certain skeletal joints such as the [[pubic symphysis]] and [[sacroiliac joint|sacroiliac]] widen or have increased laxity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Physical==
[[File:Pregnancy uterus height.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[fundal height]] at various points during pregnancy]]
One of the most noticeable alterations in pregnancy is the gain in weight. The enlarging uterus, the growing fetus, the [[placenta]] and [[amniotic fluid|liquor amnii]], the acquisition of fat and water retention, all contribute to this increase in weight.  The weight gain varies from person to person and can be anywhere from {{convert|5|lb|kg}} to over {{convert|100|lb|kg}}. In America, the doctor-recommended weight gain range is {{convert|25|lb|kg}} to {{convert|35|lb|kg}}, less if the woman is overweight, more (up to {{convert|40|lb|kg}}) if the woman is underweight.

==Breast size==
A woman's breasts grow during pregnancy, usually 1 to 2 cup sizes<ref name=bravado1>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.bravadodesigns.com/faq|publisher=BravadoDesigns.com|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref> and potentially several cup sizes. A woman who wore a C cup bra prior to her pregnancy may need to buy an F cup or larger bra while nursing.<ref name=consumerreports2>{{cite web|title=Nursing bras|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/babies-kids/baby-toddler/nursing-bras/nursing-bra-buying-advice/nursing-bra-getting-started/nursing-bra-getting-started.htm|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> A woman's torso also grows and her bra band size may increase one or two sizes.<ref name=bravado1/><ref name=consumerreports3>{{cite web|title=Nursing bras|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/babies-kids/baby-toddler/nursing-bras/nursing-bra-buying-advice/nursing-bra-features/nursing-bra-features.htm |publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> An average of 80% of women wear the wrong bra size,<ref name=wood>{{cite journal |author=Wood K, Cameron M, Fitzgerald K |title=Breast Size, Bra Fit and Thoracic Pain in Young Women: A Correlational Study |journal=Chiropractic & Osteopathy |volume=16 |page=1 |year=2008 |pmid=18339205 |pmc=2275741|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-16-1}}</ref> and mothers who are preparing to nurse can benefit from a professional bra fitting from a lactation consultant.<ref name=consumerreports3/> Once the baby is born and about 50 to 73 hours after birth, the mother will experience her breasts filling with milk (sometimes referred to as “milk coming in”) and at that point changes in the breast happen very quickly.  Once [[lactation]] begins, the woman's breasts swell significantly and can feel achy, lumpy and heavy (which is referred to as engorgement). Her breasts may increase again in size, by another 1 or 2 cup sizes,<ref name=bravado1/><ref name=consumerreports3/> and individual breast size can vary daily or for longer periods depending on how much the infant nurses from each breast. A regular pattern of nursing is usually established after 8–12 weeks, and a woman's breasts will usually reduce in size, perhaps to about 1 cup size larger than prior to her pregnancy.<ref name=bravado1/> 

Many women and medical professionals<ref>{{cite book|last=Lauersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Complete Book of Breast Care|year=1998|publisher=Fawcett Columbine/Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=978-0-449-91241-6|edition=1st Trade Paperback ed.|coauthors=Stukane, Eileen }}</ref><ref name=ayurved>{{cite web|title=Breast Sagging|url=http://www.ayurvediccure.com/breast_sagging_shapes.htm|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>  mistakenly think that [[breastfeeding]] causes their breasts to [[Ptosis (breasts)|sag]] (medically referred to as ''ptosis''),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sagging Breasts|url=http://www.channel4embarrassingillnesses.com/conditions/sagging-breasts/|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=3 February 2012|year=2009}}</ref> and as a result some are reluctant to nurse their infants. In February 2009, [[Cheryl Cole]] told British [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] that she hesitated to breastfeed because of the effect it might have on her breasts. "I want to breastfeed," she said, "but I’ve seen what it can do, so I may have to reconsider."<ref>{{cite web|last=Jay|first=Elizabeth|title=Will breastfeeding leave you with a little less lift?|url=http://thetruthaboutbreastfeeding.com/category/research/ptosis-sagging/|accessdate=2 February 2012|date=February 13, 2009}}</ref> Research shows that breastfeeding is not the factor that many thought it was.

==Cardiovascular==
The woman is the sole provider of nourishment for the [[embryo]] and later, the [[fetus]], and so her [[Blood plasma|plasma]] and blood volume slowly increase by 40-50% over the course of the pregnancy to accommodate the changes.<ref name="isbn81-8147-920-3">{{cite book |author= Guyton and hall |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |origyear= |pages= 103g |quote= |isbn=81-8147-920-3 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> The increase is mainly due to an increase in plasma volume through increased aldosterone. It results in an increase in [[heart rate]] (15 beats/min more than usual), stroke volume, and [[cardiac output]]. Cardiac output increases by about 50%, mostly during the first trimester. The systemic vascular resistance also drops due to the smooth muscle relaxation and overall [[vasodilation]] caused by elevated progesterone, leading to a fall in blood pressure. Diastolic [[blood pressure]] consequently decreases between 12–26 weeks, and increases again to pre-pregnancy levels by 36 weeks. If the blood pressure becomes abnormally high, the woman should be investigated for [[pre-eclampsia]] and other causes of [[hypertension]]. This is due to an increase in plasma volume through increased aldosterone. Progesterone may also interact with the aldosterone receptor, thus leading to increased levels. Red blood cell numbers increase due to increased [[erythropoietin]] levels.

Cardiac function is also modified, with increased heart rate and increased stroke volume. A decrease in vagal tone and increase in sympathetic tone is the cause. Blood volume increases act to increase stroke volume of the heart via [[Starling's law]]. After pregnancy the change in stroke volume is not reversed. Cardiac output rises from 4 to 7 liters in the 2nd trimester.

Blood pressure also fluctuates. In the first trimester it falls. Initially this is due to decreased sensitivity to [[angiotensin]] and vasodilation provoked by increased blood volume. Later, however, it is caused by decreased resistance to the growing uteroplacental bed.

== Haematology ==
During pregnancy the [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume increases by 50% and the red blood cell volume increases only by 20-30%.<ref name="isbn81-8147-920-3"/> Consequently, the [[hematocrit]] decreases on lab value; this is not a true decrease in hematocrit, however, but rather due to the dilution. The white blood cell count increases and may peak at over 20&nbsp;mg/mL in stressful conditions. Conversely, there is a decrease in platelet concentration to a minimal normal values of 100-150 mil/mL.

A pregnant woman will also become [[Hypercoagulability|hypercoagulable]], leading to increased risk for developing blood clots and embolisms, due to increased [[liver]] production of coagulation factors, mainly [[fibrinogen]] and [[factor VIII]] (this hypercoagulable state along with the decreased ambulation (exercise involving legs) causes an increased risk of both [[DVT]] and [[Pulmonary embolism|PE]]). Women are at highest risk for developing clots, or thrombi, during the weeks following labor. Clots usually develop in the left leg or the left iliac venous system. The left side is most afflicted because the left iliac vein is crossed by the right iliac artery. The increased flow in the right iliac artery after birth compresses the left iliac vein leading to an increased risk for thrombosis (clotting) which is exacerbated by the aforementioned lack of ambulation following delivery. Both underlying [[thrombophilia]] and [[cesarean section]] can further increase these risks.

[[Edema]], or swelling, of the feet is common during pregnancy, partly because the enlarging uterus compresses veins and lymphatic drainage from the legs.

==Metabolic==
During pregnancy, both [[protein metabolism]] and [[carbohydrate metabolism]] are affected. One [[kilogram]] of extra [[protein]] is deposited, with half going to the [[fetus]] and [[placenta]], and another half going to [[uterus|uterine]] contractile proteins, [[breast gland]]ular tissue, plasma protein, and [[haemoglobin]].

An increased requirement for nutrients is given by fetal growth and fat deposition. Changes are caused by steroid hormones, lactogen, and cortisol.

Maternal insulin resistance can lead to [[gestational diabetes]]. Increased liver metabolism is also seen, with increased gluconeogenesis to increase maternal glucose levels.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== Nutrition ===
{{main|Nutrition and pregnancy}}
Nutritionally, pregnant women require a caloric increase of 300 kcal/day and an increase in protein to 70 or 75 g/day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} There is also an increased [[folate]] requirement from 0.4 to 0.8&nbsp;mg/day (important in preventing [[neural tube defects]]). On average, a weight gain of {{convert|20|to|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}} is experienced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

All patients are advised to take [[prenatal vitamins]] to compensate for the increased nutritional requirements. The use of Omega 3 fatty acids supports mental and visual development of infants.<ref name="titleOmega-3 least known of pregnancy Big 3">{{cite web |url=http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=70645&m=1NIU918&c=dhtelyatuhgpyxm+ |title=Omega-3 least known of pregnancy "Big 3" |accessdate=2008-01-01 |format= |work=}}</ref> Choline supplementation of research mammals supports mental development that lasts throughout life.<ref name="pmid10531535">{{cite journal |author=Tees RC, Mohammadi E |title=The effects of neonatal choline dietary supplementation on adult spatial and configural learning and memory in rats |journal=Dev Psychobiol |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=226–40 |year=1999 |pmid=10531535 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2302(199911)35:3<226::AID-DEV7>3.0.CO;2-H}}</ref>

== Renal ==
A pregnant woman may experience an increase in kidney and ureter size. The [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) commonly increases by 50%, returning to normal around 20 weeks [[postpartum]].<ref name="isbn81-8147-920-3"/> Plasma [[sodium]] does not change because this is offset by the increase in GFR. There is decreased [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN) and [[creatinine]] and glucosuria (due to saturated tubular reabsorption) may be seen. Persistent glucosuria may suggest [[gestational diabetes]]. The [[renin-angiotensin system]] is upregulated, causing increased [[aldosterone]] levels.

== Gastrointestinal ==
During pregnancy, woman can experience nausea and vomiting ([[morning sickness]]); which may be due to elevated [[B-hCG]] and should resolve by 14 to 16 weeks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Additionally, there is prolonged gastric empty time, decreased gastroesophageal sphincter tone, which can lead to [[acid reflux]], and decreased colonic motility, which leads to increased water absorption and [[constipation]].
==Immune tolerance==
{{Main|Immune tolerance in pregnancy}}
The [[fetus]] inside a pregnant woman may be viewed as an unusually successful [[allograft]], since it genetically differs from the woman.<ref name=clark>{{cite journal |author=Clark DA, Chaput A, Tutton D |title=Active suppression of host-vs-graft reaction in pregnant mice.
