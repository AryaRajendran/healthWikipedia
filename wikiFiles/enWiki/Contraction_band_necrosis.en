'''Contraction band necrosis''' is a type of uncontrolled [[cell death]] ([[necrosis]]) unique to [[cardiac myocyte]]s and thought to arise in [[reperfusion]] from hypercontraction, which results in [[sarcolemma|sarcolemmal]] rupture.<ref name=pmid17530396>{{cite journal |author=Rodríguez-Sinovas A, Abdallah Y, Piper HM, Garcia-Dorado D |title=Reperfusion injury as a therapeutic challenge in patients with acute myocardial infarction |journal=Heart Fail Rev |volume=12 |issue=3-4 |pages=207–16 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17530396 |doi=10.1007/s10741-007-9039-9 |url=}}</ref>  

It is a characteristic [[histologic]] finding of a [[Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology|recent]] [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) that was partially reperfused.

The name of the [[histopathology|histopathologic]] finding comes from the appearance under the microscope; contraction bands are thick intensely eosinophilic staining bands (typically 4-5 [[micrometre]]s wide) that span the short axis of the myocyte.  They can be thought of extra thick [[striae]], typical of [[cardiac muscle]] and [[striated muscle]]. 

==Pathophysiology==
Contraction band necrosis is thought to arise by two mechanisms:<ref name=pmid17530396/>
#a [[calcium]]-dependent mechanism - activation of the contractile machinery of the cell via its usual mechanism, calcium, which is in excess due to [[ischemia]].
#a calcium-independent mechanism, as seen in [[rigor mortis|rigor]] - activation of the contractile machinery in the setting of low ATP.

Reperfusion associated cell death has been modulated (reduced) in [[animal studies]]<ref name=pmid9396458>{{cite journal |author=Garcia-Dorado D, Inserte J, Ruiz-Meana M, ''et al.'' |title=Gap junction uncoupler heptanol prevents cell-to-cell progression of hypercontracture and limits necrosis during myocardial reperfusion |journal=Circulation |volume=96 |issue=10 |pages=3579–86 |year=1997 |month=November |pmid=9396458 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and is an area of active research, which holds the potential to significantly reduce the [[morbidity]] (disease burden) and [[mortality rate|mortality]] (death) of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name=pmid17530396/>
