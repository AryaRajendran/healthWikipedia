The '''general medical examination''' is a common form of [[preventive medicine]] involving visits to a [[general practitioner]] by [[asymptomatic]] adults on a regular basis. This is generally yearly or less frequently. It is known under several other names, such as the '''periodic health evaluation''', '''annual physical''', '''comprehensive medical exam''', '''general health check''', or '''preventive health examination'''.

The term is generally ''not'' meant to include visits for the purpose of [[newborn checks]], [[Papanicolaou smear|Pap smear]]s for [[cervical cancer]], or regular visits for people with certain [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] medical disorders (for example, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]).<ref name="pmid17310053"/> The general medical examination generally involves a [[medical history]], a (brief or complete) [[physical examination]] and sometimes [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] tests. Some more advanced tests include ultrasound and mammography. 

==Usefulness==
Although annual medical examinations are a routine practice in several countries, it is poorly supported by [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]] in the majority of the population. A 2012 [[Cochrane review]] did not find any benefit with respect to the risk of death or poor outcomes related to disease in those who received them.<ref name=Coch2012>{{cite journal|title=General health checks in adults for reducing morbidity and mortality from disease|date=2012, Oct 17|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009009.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009009.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=53C3360857C2E2AC3DE4012D34C67F01.d01t04|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> People who undergo yearly medical exams however are more likely to be diagnosed with medical problems.<ref name=Coch2012/>

A [[systematic review]] of studies until September 2006 concluded that the examination does result in better delivery of some other screening interventions (such as Pap smears, [[cholesterol]] screening, and [[faecal occult blood|faecal occult blood tests]]) and less patient worry.<ref name="pmid17310053">{{cite journal |author=Boulware LE, Marinopoulos S, Phillips KA, ''et al.'' |title=Systematic review: the value of the periodic health evaluation |journal=Ann.

The arguments for and against are similar for many other [[screening (medicine)|screening]] interventions. The possible advantages include detection and subsequent prevention or early treatment for conditions such as [[high blood pressure]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[smoking]], [[Reference Daily Intake|unhealthy diet]], [[obesity]] and various [[cancer]]s. Moreover, they could improve the [[patient-physician relationship]] and decrease patient [[anxiety]].

It is commonly performed in the United States and the United Kingdom, whereas the practice varies among mainland European countries.
