'''Prostate cancer''' is a form of [[cancer]] that develops in the [[prostate]], a gland in the [[male]] [[reproductive system]].

Prostate cancer may cause pain, difficulty in [[urination|urinating]], problems during sexual intercourse, or [[erectile dysfunction]]. Other symptoms can potentially develop during later stages of the disease.

The presence of prostate cancer may be indicated by [[symptom]]s, [[physical examination]], [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA), or [[biopsy]]. Prostate-specific antigen testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality.<ref name="BMJ2010"/>  The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] in 2012 recommended against [[Prostate cancer screening|screening for prostate cancer]] using the PSA testing, due to the risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment with most prostate cancer remaining asymptomatic.<ref name=USPTF2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening/prostatecancerscript.pdf |title=Talking With Your Patients About Screening for Prostate Cancer |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref>  The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefit of testing does not outweigh the expected harms.<ref name=USPTF2012/>  

Management strategies for prostate cancer should be guided by the severity of the disease. Many low-risk tumors can be safely followed with active surveillance. Curative treatment generally involves  [[surgery]], various forms of [[radiation therapy]], or, less commonly, [[cryosurgery]]; [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] are generally reserved for cases of advanced disease (although hormonal therapy may be given with radiation in some cases). Several studies suggest that [[masturbation]] reduces the risk of prostate cancer.<ref>''Ejaculation Frequency and Subsequent Risk of Prostate Cancer'', Michael F. Leitzmann, MD; Elizabeth A. Platz, ScD; Meir J. Stampfer, MD; Walter C. Willett, MD; Edward Giovannucci, MD, Journal of the American Medical Association. 2004;291(13):1578-1586. doi:10.1001/jama.291.13.1578.</ref><ref>Giles, G.G., Severi, G., English, D.R., McCredie, M.R.E., Borland, R., Boyle, P. and Hopper, J.L.

The age and underlying health of the man, the extent of [[metastasis]], appearance under the [[microscope]] and response of the cancer to initial treatment are important in determining the [[prognosis|outcome]] of the disease. The decision whether or not to treat localized prostate cancer (a tumor that is contained within the prostate) with curative intent is a [[patient trade-off]] between the expected beneficial and harmful effects in terms of patient survival and [[quality of life]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Early prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms. Sometimes, however, prostate cancer does cause symptoms, often similar to those of diseases such as [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. These include frequent urination, [[nocturia]] (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, [[hematuria]] (blood in the urine), and [[dysuria]] (painful urination). About a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have one or more such symptoms, while two thirds have no symptoms.<ref name=prostateCApresentation />

Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function. Because the ''[[vas deferens]]'' deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving [[erection]] or painful [[ejaculation]].<ref name=prostateCApresentation>{{cite journal |author = Miller DC, Hafez KS, Stewart A, Montie JE, Wei JT |title = Prostate carcinoma presentation, diagnosis, and staging: an update form the National Cancer Data Base |journal = Cancer |volume = 98 |issue = 6 | pages = 1169–78 |year = 2003 |month = September |pmid = 12973840 |doi = 10.1002/cncr.11635 |url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12973840 }}</ref>

Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body, possibly causing additional symptoms. The most common symptom is [[bone pain]], often in the [[vertebrae]] (bones of the spine), [[pelvis]], or [[rib]]s. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the [[femur]] is usually to the proximal part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the [[vertebral column|spine]] can also compress the [[spinal cord]], causing leg weakness and [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]].<ref>{{cite journal |author = van der Cruijsen-Koeter IW, Vis AN, Roobol MJ, Wildhagen MF, de Koning HJ, van der Kwast TH, Schroder FH |title = Comparison of screen detected and clinically diagnosed prostate cancer in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer, section rotterdam | journal = Urol |volume = 174 |issue = 1 |pages = 121–5 |year = 2005 |month = July |pmid = 15947595 |doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000162061.40533.0f }}</ref>

Loss of cancer suppressor genes, early in the prostatic carcinogenesis, have been localized to chromosomes'' 8p'', ''10q'', ''13q'',and ''16q''. [[P53]] mutations in the primary prostate cancer are relatively low and are more frequently seen in metastatic settings, hence, [[p53]] mutations are late event in pathology of prostate cancer. Other tumor suppressor genes that are thought to play a role in prostate cancer include [[PTEN (gene)]] and [[KAI1]]. "Up to 70 percent of men with prostate cancer have lost one copy of the PTEN  gene at the time of diagnosis"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/59384.cfm |title=Scientists Discover Anti-Cancer Mechanism that Arrests Early Prostate Cancer |date=August 4, 2005 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Prostatelead.jpg|right|thumb]]
The [[prostate]] is a part of the male [[reproductive system|reproductive]] system that helps make and store [[seminal fluid]]. In adult men, a typical prostate is about three centimeters long and weighs about twenty grams.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Aumüller| first=G.| title=Prostate Gland and Seminal Vesicles| publisher=Springer-Verlag| location=Berlin-Heidelberg| year=1979}}</ref> It is located in the [[pelvis]], under the [[urinary bladder]] and in front of the [[rectum]]. The prostate surrounds part of the [[urethra]], the tube that carries [[urine]] from the bladder during [[urination]] and semen during [[ejaculation]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Moore| first=K.| coauthors=Dalley, A.| title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy| publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| location=Baltimore, Maryland| year=1999| isbn=0-683-06132-1}}</ref> Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely [[defecation]]. The prostate contains many small [[gland]]s which make about twenty percent of the fluid constituting [[semen]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Steive| first=H.| chapter=''Männliche Genitalorgane''| title=''Handbuch der mikroskopischen Anatomie des Menschen.'' Vol. VII Part 2| pages=1–399| location=Berlin| publisher=Springer| year=1930}}</ref> In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands [[Mutation|mutate]] into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male [[hormone]]s, known as [[androgen]]s, to work properly. Androgens include [[testosterone]], which is made in the [[testes]]; [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], made in the [[adrenal gland]]s; and [[dihydrotestosterone]], which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for [[secondary sex characteristic]]s such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.

[[File:Normal cancer cell division from NIH-2.svg|thumb|right|When normal cells are damaged beyond repair, they are eliminated by [[apoptosis]]. Cancer cells avoid apoptosis and continue to multiply in an unregulated manner.]]

Prostate cancer is classified as an [[adenocarcinoma]], or glandular cancer, that begins when normal semen-secreting prostate gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain confined to otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as [[carcinoma in situ]] or [[prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia]] (PIN). Although there is no proof that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cancer cells begin to multiply and spread to the surrounding prostate tissue (the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]) forming a [[tumor]]. Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the [[seminal vesicles]] or the [[rectum]], or the tumor cells may develop the ability to travel in the [[blood]]stream and [[lymphatic system]]. Prostate cancer is considered a [[malignant]] tumor because it is a mass of cells that can invade other parts of the body. This invasion of other organs is called [[metastasis]]. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the [[bone]]s, [[lymph node]]s, and may invade rectum, [[bladder]] and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be venous as the [[prostatic venous plexus]] draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.<ref name='metastasis-route'>{{cite web | url = http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gu/prostate3.cfm | title = Male Genitals - Prostate Neoplasms | accessdate = 2011-04-28 | work = Pathology study images | publisher = University of Virginia School of Medicine | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yHQ19Rrp | archivedate = 2011-04-28 | quote = There are many connections between the prostatic venous plexus and the vertebral veins. The veins forming the prostatic plexus do not contain valves and it is thought that straining to urinate causes prostatic venous blood to flow in a reverse direction and enter the vertebral veins carrying malignant cells to the vertebral column.}}</ref>

The prostate is a zinc accumulating, [[citrate]] producing organ. The protein [[ZIP1]] is responsible for the active transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of zinc's important roles is to change the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. This allows prostate cancer cells to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the transporter protein ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene [[SLC39A1]]. The cause of the epigenetic silencing is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits [[NF-κB]] pathways, is anti-proliferative, and induces apoptosis in abnormal cells.  Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without the active transporter, ZIP1.<ref>Journal-molecular cancer, review, 2006 5:17, {{doi|10.1186/1476-4598-5-17}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The American Cancer Society's position regarding early detection is "Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment. The American Cancer Society believes that men should not be tested without learning about what we know and don’t know about the risks and possible benefits of testing and treatment.  Starting at age 50, (45 if African American or brother or father suffered from condition before age 65) talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of testing so you can decide if testing is the right choice for you."<ref>http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/FindCancerEarly/CancerScreeningGuidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer American Cancer Society American Cancer Society Guidelines for the early detection of cancer Cited: September 2011</ref>

The only test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a [[biopsy]], the removal of small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. However, prior to a biopsy, less invasive testing can be conducted.  

According to Professor Hardev Pandha, The Prostate Project Chair of Urological Oncology at the University of Surrey's Postgraduate Medical School, a non-invasive test looking for the presence of the protein [[EN2 (gene)|Engrailed-2 (EN2)]] in the urine to be more reliable and accurate than existing tests.

"In this study, we showed that the new test was twice as good at finding prostate cancer as the standard PSA test. Only rarely did we find EN2 in the urine of men who were cancer free, so if we find EN2 we can be reasonably sure that a man has prostate cancer. EN2 was not detected in men with non-cancer disorders of the prostate such as prostatitis or benign enlargement. These conditions often cause a high PSA result, causing considerable stress for the patient and sometimes also unnecessary further tests such as prostate biopsies." <ref name="caerleonpharmacy.cambrianalliance">http://caerleonpharmacy.cambrianalliance.co.uk/index.php?option=com_news&view=news&layout=archive&id=543 New prostate cancer twice as effective as a PSA test could be available by next year.

There are also several other tests that can be used to gather more information about the prostate and the urinary tract. Digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE) may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. [[Cystoscopy]] shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted down the [[urethra]]. [[Transrectal ultrasonography]] creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum.

===Prostate imaging===
Ultrasound (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are the two main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection. Urologists use transrectal ultrasound during prostate biopsy and can sometimes see a hypoechoic area (tissues or structures that reflect relatively less of the ultrasound waves directed at them). But US has poor tissue resolution and thus, is generally not clinically used. In contrast, prostate MRI has superior soft tissue resolution. MRI is a type of imaging that uses magnetic fields to locate and characterize prostate cancer. Multi-parametric prostate MRI consists of four types of MRI sequences called T2 weighted imaging, T1 weighted imaging, Diffusion Weighted Imaging, MR Spectrocopic Imaging and Dynamic-Contrast Enhanced Imaging.<ref name="pmid21571651">{{cite journal | author = Bonekamp D, Jacobs MA, El-Khouli R, Stoianovici D, Macura KJ | title = Advancements in MR Imaging of the Prostate: From Diagnosis to Interventions | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 677–703 | year = 2011 | month = May–June | pmid = 21571651 | pmc = 3093638 | doi = 10.1148/rg.313105139 }}</ref> Genitourinary radiologists use multi-parametric MRI to locate and identify prostate cancer.

[[File:Prostatic adenocarcinoma with perineural invasion.JPG|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing a prostate cancer (conventional adenocarcinoma) with [[perineural invasion]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a [[urology|urologist]] or [[radiology|radiologist]] obtains tissue samples from the prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six on each side of the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Fifty-five percent of men report discomfort during prostate biopsy.<ref name="pmid9637143">{{cite journal | author = Essink-Bot ML, de Koning HJ, Nijs HG, Kirkels WJ, van der Maas PJ, Schröder FH | title = Short-term effects of population-based screening for prostate cancer on health-related quality of life | journal = J.

The upregulation of BCL-2 after androgen ablation in prostate carcinoma cell lines and in a castrated-male rat model further established a connection between BCL-2 expression and prostate cancer progression.<ref name="pmid12510149">{{cite journal | author = Catz SD, Johnson JL | title = BCL-2 in prostate cancer: a minireview | journal = Apoptosis | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–37 | year = 2003 | month = January | pmid = 12510149 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021692801278 }}</ref>

ERK5 is a protein that may be used as a marker. ERK5 is present in abnormally high levels of prostate cancer, including invasive cancer which has spread to other parts of the body. It is also present in relapsed cancer following previous hormone therapy. Research shows that reducing the amount of ERK5 found in cancerous cells reduces their invasiveness.<ref>British Journal of Cancer - 15 Feb 2011</ref>

===Classification===
{{Main|Prostate cancer staging}}
An important part of evaluating prostate cancer is determining the [[Cancer staging|stage]], or how far the cancer has spread. Knowing the stage helps define [[prognosis]] and is useful when selecting therapies. The most common system is the four-stage [[TNM staging system|TNM system]] (abbreviated from Tumor/Nodes/Metastases). Its components include the size of the tumor, the number of involved [[lymph node]]s, and the presence of any other [[Metastasis|metastases]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/besttreatments/prostate-cancer-how-far-has-your-cancer-spread-the-tnm-system |title= Prostate cancer: How far has your cancer spread? The TNM system|author=BMJ Group |date=8 December 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=9 August 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

The most important distinction made by any staging system is whether or not the cancer is still confined to the prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have spread elsewhere. Several tests can be used to look for evidence of spread. [[Specialty (medicine)|Medical specialty]] [[professional organizations]] recommend against the use of [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>

*{{cite PMID|17509297}}</ref> Those tests would be appropriate in such cases as when a CT scan evaluates spread within the pelvis, a bone scan look for spread to the bones, and [[endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging]] to closely evaluate the prostatic capsule and the [[seminal vesicles]]. Bone scans should reveal [[osteoblast]]ic appearance due to ''increased'' bone density in the areas of [[bone metastasis]]—opposite to what is found in many other cancers that metastasize.

After a prostate biopsy, a [[pathology|pathologist]] looks at the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the [[Grading (tumors)|grade]] of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason system is used to grade prostate tumors from 2 to 10, where a [[Gleason score]] of 10 indicates the most abnormalities. The pathologist assigns a number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does the same for the second-most-common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the Gleason score. The [[Whitmore-Jewett stage]] is another method sometimes used.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of prostate cancer}}
The first decision to be made in managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed. Prostate cancer, especially low-grade forms found in the elderly, often grows slowly that no treatment is required.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/health/cancer-by-any-other-name-would-not-be-as-terrifying.html| title = ‘Cancer’ or ‘Weird Cells’: Which Sounds Deadlier?| author = Kolata, Gina| date = 21 November 2011| newspaper = The New York Times }}</ref> Treatment may also be inappropriate if a person has other serious health problems or is not expected to live long enough for symptoms to appear.

Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s, such as [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[urinary incontinence]], treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. A combination of the treatment options is often recommended for managing prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lu-Yao GL, Albertsen PC, Moore DF, Shih W, Lin Y, DiPaola RS, Barry MJ, Zietman A, O'Leary M, Walker-Corkery E, Yao SL | title = Outcomes of Localized Prostate Cancer Following Conservative Management | journal = The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 302 | issue = 11 | pages = 1202–09 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19755699 | pmc = 2822438 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1348 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19945664">{{cite journal | author = Mongiat-Artus P, Peyromaure M, Richaud P, Droz JP, Rainfray M, Jeandel C, Rebillard X, Moreau JL, Davin JL, Salomon L, Soulié M | title = [Recommendations for the treatment of prostate cancer in the elderly man: A study by the oncology committee of the French association of urology] | language = French | journal = Prog.

If [[radiation therapy]] is done first, and fails, then [[radical prostatectomy]] is very technically challenging surgery and may not be feasible.

===Surveillance===
Many men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer are eligible for ''active surveillance''. This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, with the intention of treatment for cure if there are signs of cancer progression. Active surveillance is ''not'' synonymous with [[watchful waiting]], an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that ''palliative'', not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.

Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for signs of growth or the appearance of symptoms.  The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies.  The goal of surveillance is to avoid [[overtreatment]] and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the patient.  This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause [[anxiety]] for patients who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have a life-threatening cancer. 

For  50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 |title=Active Surveillance May Be Preferred Option in Some Men with Prostate Cancer |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref>

===Aggressive cancer===
Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve [[surgery]] (i.e. radical prostatectomy), [[radiation therapy]] including [[brachytherapy]] ([[prostate brachytherapy]]) and external beam radiation therapy, [[High-intensity focused ultrasound]] (HIFU), [[chemotherapy]], oral chemotherapeutic drugs (Temozolomide/TMZ), [[cryosurgery]], [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]], or some combination.<ref name="pmid19946787">{{cite journal | author = Hong H, Zhang Y, Sun J, Cai W | title = Positron emission tomography imaging of prostate cancer | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–27 | year = 2009 | month = November | pmid = 19946787 | pmc = 2883014 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-009-0394-9 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19945663">{{cite journal | author = Peyromaure M, Valéri A, Rebillard X, Beuzeboc P, Richaud P, Soulié M, Salomon L | title = [Characteristics of prostate cancer in men less than 50-year-old] | language = French | journal = Prog.

Although the widespread use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening in the USA has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick JM | title = Management of localized prostate cancer in senior adults: the crucial role of comorbidity | journal = BJU international | volume = 101 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 16–22 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18307688 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07487.x }}</ref> Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nccn.org/index.asp |title=Evidence-Based Cancer Guidelines, Oncology Drug Compendium, Oncology Continuing Medical Education |publisher=NCCN |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting. This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic disease, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease. The results of one randomized controlled trial published by the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 <ref>{{cite journal | author = Bill-Axelson A, Holmberg L, Filén F, Ruutu M, Garmo H, Busch C, Nordling S, Häggman M, Andersson SO | title = Radical Prostatectomy Versus Watchful Waiting in Localized Prostate Cancer: the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 Randomized Trial | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 100 | issue = 16 | pages = 1144–54 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18695132 | pmc = 2518167 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djn255 }}</ref> evaluated cancer-specific mortality in patients treated with RP compared with watchful waiting. The patients receiving radical prostatectomy had a relative risk reduction of 30.7% [95% confidence interval 2.5%-50.7%], but an absolute risk reduction of 6% [95% confidence interval 0.5%-11.5%]. The number needed to treat was calculated to be 16. This means that, over the median follow up period of approximately 10 years, 16 patients with localized prostate cancer would need to receive radical prostatectomy rather than watchful waiting in order to prevent one death due to prostate cancer. Further subset analysis revealed that this benefit did not apply to all ages equally. In men younger than 65 years, patients randomized to receive radical prostatectomy actually had a 10-18% absolute risk reduction in cancer-specific mortality compared to those randomized to watchful waiting. However, in men older than 65, there was no statistically significant risk reduction even when adjusted for PSA level, Gleason score and tumor stage. Randomized, controlled trials comparing radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and watchful waiting would provide the best evidence for how to best treat elderly patients.<!-- The above para should be condensed --> 

If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer use a variety of [[nomogram]]s to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, HIFU, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormonal therapy]] and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] is used for some early stage tumors. [[Cryotherapy]] (the process of freezing the tumor), [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]], and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.

==={{anchor|Castration-resistant prostate cancer}} Castration-resistant===
Most hormone dependent cancers become refractory after one to three years and resume growth despite hormone therapy.  Previously considered "hormone-refractory prostate cancer" or "androgen-independent prostate cancer", the term castration-resistant has replaced "hormone refractory" because while they are no longer responsive to castration treatment (reduction of available [[androgen]]/[[testosterone]]/[[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] by chemical or surgical means), these cancers still show reliance upon hormones for [[androgen receptor]] activation.<ref name="pmid20859283">{{cite journal | author = Seruga B, Ocana A, Tannock IF | title = Drug resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer | journal = Nat Rev Clin Oncol | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | year = 2011 | month = January | pmid = 20859283 | doi = 10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.136 }}</ref> Before 2004, all treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) were considered{{who|date=July 2011}} [[palliative care|palliative]] and not shown to prolong survival.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} However, there are now several treatments available to treat CRPC that improve survival.

Off-label use of the oral drug [[ketoconazole]] is sometimes used as a way to further manipulate hormones with a therapeutic effect in CRPC. However, many side effects are possible with this drug and [[abiraterone]] is likely to supplant usage since it has a similar mechanism of action with less toxic side effects.  

A combination of [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin), [[docetaxel]], [[thalidomide]] and [[prednisone]] appears effective in the treatment of CRPC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professional.cancerconsultants.com/oncology_main_news.aspx?id=44815 |title=Avastin, Thalomid, Taxotere, and Prednisone Effective for Men with Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer |date = March 2010|accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prostate cancer rates are higher and prognoses are poorer in developed countries than in the rest of the world. Many of the risk factors for prostate cancer are more prevalent in the [[developed world]], including longer life expectancy and diets high in red meat. (People who consume larger amounts of meat and dairy also tend to consume fewer portions of fruits and vegetables. It is not currently clear whether both of these factors, or just one of them, contribute <!--predicate agrees with the subject, in this case, 'factors'--> to the occurrence of prostate cancer.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_prostate_cancer_36.asp ACS :: What Are The Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer?]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>) Also, where there is more access to screening programs, there is a higher detection rate. Prostate cancer is the ninth-most-common cancer in the world, but is the number-one non-skin cancer in men from the United States. Prostate cancer affected 18 percent of American men and caused death in three percent in 2005.<ref name="pmid15661684"/> In [[Japan]], death from prostate cancer was one-fifth to one-half the rates in the United States and [[Europe]] in the 1990s.<ref name="pmid15714967">{{cite journal | author = Wakai K | title = [Descriptive epidemiology of prostate cancer in Japan and Western countries] | language = Japanese | journal = Nippon Rinsho | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–12 | year = 2005 | month = February | pmid = 15714967 | doi =  }}</ref> In [[India]] in the 1990s, half of the people with prostate cancer confined to the prostate died within ten years.<ref name="pmid1259345">{{cite journal | author = Jaubert de Beaujeu M, Chavrier Y | title = [Deformations of the anterior thoracic wall (author's transl)] | language = French | journal = Ann Chir Thorac Cardiovasc | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | year = 1976 | month = January | pmid = 1259345 | doi =  }}</ref> African-American men have 50–60 times more prostate cancer and prostate cancer deaths than men in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].<ref name="pmid10585584">{{cite journal | author = Hsing AW, Tsao L, Devesa SS | title = International trends and patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality | journal = Int.

In patients who undergo treatment, the most important clinical prognostic indicators of disease outcome are stage, pre-therapy PSA level, and Gleason score. In general, the higher the grade and the stage, the poorer the prognosis. [[Nomogram]]s can be used to calculate the estimated risk of the individual patient. The predictions are based on the experience of large groups of patients suffering from cancers at various stages.<ref name="pmid14571407">{{cite journal | author = Di Blasio CJ, Rhee AC, Cho D, Scardino PT, Kattan MW | title = Predicting clinical end points: treatment nomograms in prostate cancer | journal = Semin.

===Classification systems===
Many prostate cancers are not destined to be lethal, and most men will ultimately die from causes other than of the disease. Decisions about treatment type and timing may, therefore, be informed by an estimation of the risk that the tumor will ultimately recur after treatment and/or progress to metastases and mortality. Several tools are available to help predict outcomes, such as pathologic stage and recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy. Most combine stage, grade, and PSA level, and some also add the number or percent of biopsy cores positive, age, and/or other information.

*The ''D'Amico classification'' stratifies men by low, intermediate, or high risk based on stage, grade, and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the 3-level system is that it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score ''and'' high PSA) in stratifying patients.
*The [[Partin tables]] predict pathologic outcomes (margin status, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion) based on the same three variables and are published as lookup tables.
*The ''Kattan nomograms'' predict recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy, based on data available either at time of diagnosis or after surgery. The nomograms can be calculated using paper graphs or software available on a website or for handheld computers. The Kattan score represents the likelihood of remaining free of disease at a given time interval following treatment.
*The UCSF ''Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score'' predicts both pathologic status and recurrence after surgery. It offers comparable accuracy as the Kattan preoperative nomogram, and can be calculated without paper tables or a calculator. Points are assigned based on PSA, Grade, stage, age, and percent of cores positive; the sum yields a 0–10 score, with every 2 points representing roughly a doubling of risk of recurrence. The CAPRA score was derived from community-based data in the [http://www.capsure.net CaPSURE] database. It has been validated among over 10,000 prostatectomy patients, including patients from CaPSURE;<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cooperberg MR | title = The UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) Score: a straightforward and reliable preoperative predictor of disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy | journal = J.

==History==
Although the prostate was first described by [[Venice|Venetian]] anatomist [[Niccolò Massa]] in 1536, and illustrated by [[Flanders|Flemish]] anatomist [[Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius]] in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams J | title = The case of scirrhous of the prostate gland with corresponding affliction of the lymphatic glands in the lumbar region and in the pelvis | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 1853 | pmid =  | doi =  }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] and poorer detection methods in the 19th century.

[[Transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Walsh PC, Lepor H, Eggleston JC | title = Radical prostatectomy with preservation of sexual function: anatomical and pathological considerations | journal = The Prostate | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 473–85 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6889192 | doi = 10.1002/pros.2990040506 }}</ref> This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.

The initial regimen of [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[5-fluorouracil]] was quickly joined by multiple regimens using a host of other systemic chemotherapy drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Scott WW, Johnson DE, Schmidt JE, Gibbons RP, Prout GR, Joiner JR, Saroff J, Murphy GP | title = Chemotherapy of advanced prostatic carcinoma with cyclophosphamide or 5-fluorouracil: results of first national randomized study | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–11 | year = 1975 | month = December | pmid = 1104900 | doi =  }}</ref>

===Cell-of-origin===
A series of studies published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' involved introduced viruses known to cause cancerous mutation in prostate cells: AKT, ERG, and AR into isolated samples of [[Stratum germinativum|basal]] and luminal cells and grafted the treated tissue into mice. After 16 weeks, none of the luminal samples had undergone malignant mutation, while the basal samples had mutated into prostate-like tubules which had then developed malignancy and formed cancerous tumors, which appeared identical to human samples under magnification. This led to the conclusion that the prostate [[basal cell]] may be the most likely "site of origin" of prostate cancer.<ref name="pmid20671189">{{cite journal | author = Goldstein AS, Huang J, Guo C, Garraway IP, Witte ON | title = Identification of a cell of origin for human prostate cancer | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5991 | pages = 568–71 | year = 2010 | month = July | pmid = 20671189 | pmc = 2917982 | doi = 10.1126/science.1189992 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==
People with prostate cancer generally encounter significant disparities in awareness, funding, media coverage, and research—and therefore, inferior treatment and poorer outcomes—compared to other cancers of equal prevalence.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Arnst |first=Catherine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070612_953676.htm |title=A Gender Gap in Cancer |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> In 2001, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] had 3,000 nurses specializing in [[breast cancer]], compared to only one for prostate cancer. It also discovered that the waiting time between referral and diagnosis was two weeks for breast cancer but three months for prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2001/oct/07/cancercare | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Anthony | last=Browne | title=Cancer bias puts breasts first | date=2001-10-07}}</ref> A 2007 report by the U.S.-based [[ZERO—The Project to End Prostate Cancer|National Prostate Cancer Coalition]] stated that for every prostate cancer drug on the market, there were seven used to treat breast cancer. ''[[The Times]]'' also noted an "anti-male bias in cancer funding" with a four to one discrepancy in the [[United Kingdom]] by both the government and by cancer charities such as [[Cancer Research UK]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article579050.ece Men lose out in battle for cancer cash - Times Online]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> Equality campaigners such as author [[Warren Farrell]] cite such stark spending inequalities as a clear example of governments unfairly favouring women's health over men's health.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mRkqAAAAYAAJ&dq=prostate+cancer+misandry&q=prostate#search_anchor |title=Does feminism discriminate against ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2011-08-29|isbn=978-0-19-531283-6}}</ref>

Disparities also extend into areas such as detection, with governments failing to fund or mandate prostate cancer screening while fully supporting breast cancer programs. For example, a 2007 report found 49 U.S. states mandate insurance coverage for routine breast cancer screening, compared to 28 for prostate cancer.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article579050.ece ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> Prostate cancer also experiences significantly less media coverage than other, equally prevalent cancers, with a study by Prostate Coalition showing 2.6 breast cancer stories for each one covering cancer of the prostate.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Prostate Cancer Awareness Month takes place in September in a number of countries. A light blue ribbon is used to promote the cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/05/breast-cancer-receives-much-more-research-funding-publicity-than-prostate-cancer-despite-similar-number-of-victims/ |title=Breast cancer receives much more research funding, publicity than prostate cancer despite similar number of victims |publisher=The Daily Caller |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7258393/ns/health-cancer/ |title=Prostate cancer in shadow of female counterpart - Health - Cancer - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-03-28 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref>

A [[genistein]] derivative [[KBU2046]] is under investigation for prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://defeatosteosarcoma.org/2010/11/isoflavone-genistein-derived-drug-kbu2046-inhibits-prostate-tumor-metastasis/ |title=Isoflavone-genistein derived drug, KBU2046, inhibits prostate tumor metastasis |date=16 Nov 2010 |author=Bergan at al. }}</ref> [[MDV3100]] is in phase III trials for HRPC (chemo-naive and post-chemo patient populations).<ref name=CT.gov>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?intr=%22MDV3100%22 ClinicalTrials.gov listing of MDV3100 articles</ref> [[Alpharadin]] completed a phase 3 trial for CRPC patients with bone metastasis.

===Prostate cancer models===
Scientists have established a few prostate cancer [[cell lines]] to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. [[LNCaP]], PC-3 ([[PC3]]), and DU-145 ([[DU145]]) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express [[androgen receptor]] (AR); however, PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated [[transcription factor]], belongs to the steroid [[nuclear receptor]] family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer. The proliferation of LNCaP cells is [[androgen]]-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is [[androgen]]-insensitive. Elevation of AR expression is often observed in advanced prostate [[tumor]]s in patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Linja MJ, Savinainen KJ, Saramäki OR, Tammela TL, Vessella RL, Visakorpi T | title = Amplification and overexpression of androgen receptor gene in hormone-refractory prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 3550–5 | year = 2001 | month = May | pmid = 11325816 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11325816 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Ford OH, Gregory CW, Kim D, Smitherman AB, Mohler JL | title = Androgen receptor gene amplification and protein expression in recurrent prostate cancer | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 170 | issue = 5 | pages = 1817–21 | year = 2003 | month = November | pmid = 14532783 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000091873.09677.f4 }}</ref> Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate cancer progression. These [[androgen]]-independent LNCaP cells have elevated [[Androgen receptor|AR]] expression and express [[prostate specific antigen]] upon [[androgen]] treatment.

===Diagnosis===
At present, an active area of research and non-clinically applied investigations involve non-invasive methods of prostate tumor detection. Adenoviruses modified to transfect tumor cells with harmless yet distinct genes (such as [[luciferase]]) have proven capable of early detection. So far, however, this area of research has been tested only in animal and [[LNCaP]] cell models.<ref name="pmid15865048">{{cite journal | author = Iyer M, Salazar FB, Lewis X, Zhang L, Wu L, Carey M, Gambhir SS | title = Non-invasive imaging of a transgenic mouse model using a prostate-specific two-step transcriptional amplification strategy | journal = Transgenic Res. | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–55 | year = 2005 | month = February | pmid = 15865048 | doi = 10.1007/s11248-004-2836-1 }}</ref>

;EN2
Presence of the [[EN2 (gene)]] in urine has been correlated to a high probability of prostate cancer.<ref name="pmid21364037">{{cite journal | author = Morgan R, Boxall A, Bhatt A, Bailey M, Hindley R, Langley S, Whitaker HC, Neal DE, Ismail M, Whitaker H, Annels N, Michael A, Pandha H | title = Engrailed-2 (EN2): a tumor specific urinary biomarker for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer | journal = Clin.

;PCA3
Another potential non-invasive method of early prostate tumor detection is through a molecular test that detects the presence of cell-associated [[PCA3]] mRNA in fluid massaged from the prostate by the doctor and first-void urinated out within a limited amount of urine into the specimen container. PCA3 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively by prostate cells and has been shown to be highly over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. The test result is currently reported as a specimen ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA. Although not a replacement for serum PSA level, the PCA3 test is an additional tool to help decide whether, in men suspected of having prostate cancer (especially if an initial biopsy fails to explain the elevated serum PSA), a biopsy/rebiopsy is really needed. The higher the expression of PCA3 in the sample, the greater the likelihood of a positive biopsy; i.e., the presence of cancer cells in the prostate.<ref name="pmid21176272">{{cite journal | author = Bourdoumis A, Papatsoris AG, Chrisofos M, Efstathiou E, Skolarikos A, Deliveliotis C | title = The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker | journal = Int Braz J Urol | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 665–8; discussion 669 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21176272 | doi =  }}</ref>

;Early prostate cancer antigen-2
A new blood test for [[early prostate cancer antigen-2]] (EPCA-2) may alert men if they have prostate cancer and how aggressive it will be.<ref name="pmid17437801">{{cite journal | author = Hansel DE, DeMarzo AM, Platz EA, Jadallah S, Hicks J, Epstein JI, Partin AW, Netto GJ | title = Early prostate cancer antigen expression in predicting presence of prostate cancer in men with histologically negative biopsies | journal = J.

[[Thrombophlebitis]] is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and may be a good way for physicians to remind themselves to screen patients with thrombophlebitis for prostate cancer as well since these two are closely linked.<ref name="pmid19946524">{{cite journal | author = van Weert HC, Pingen F | title = Recurrent thromboflebitis as a warning sign for cancer: a case report | journal = Cases J | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2009 | pmid = 19946524 | pmc = 2783109 | doi = 10.1186/1757-1626-2-153 }}</ref>

;Prostasomes
Epithelial cells of the prostate secrete [[prostasomes]] as well as [[Prostate-specific antigen|PSA]]. Prostasomes are membrane–surrounded, prostate-derived organelles that appear extracellularly, and one of their physiological functions is to protect the sperm from attacks by the female immune system. Cancerous prostate cells continue to synthesize and secrete prostasomes, and may be shielded against immunological attacks by these prostasomes. Research of several aspects of prostasomal involvement in prostate cancer has been performed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nilsson BO, Carlsson L, Larsson A, Ronquist G | title = Autoantibodies to prostasomes as new markers for prostate cancer | journal = Ups.
