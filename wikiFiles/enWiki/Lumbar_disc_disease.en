'''Lumbar disc disease''' is the drying out of the spongy interior matrix of an [[intervertebral disc]] in the [[vertebral column|spine]]. Many physicians and patients use the term lumbar disc disease to encompass several different causes of [[back pain]] or [[sciatica]]. In this article, the term is used to describe a lumbar herniated disc. It is thought that lumbar disc disease causes about one-third of all back pain.

==Symptoms==
[[Pain]], loss of [[Physical strength|muscle strength]] and loss of [[somatosensory system|touch]] sensation may occur if this [[Spinal disc herniation|herniation]] causes the compression of the most proximal part of the nerve closely neighbouring the intervertebral disc material. Pain is in the distribution of the nerve compressed, usually down the back of the leg, side of the calf and inside of the foot ([[sciatica]]). Most commonly, the nerve root between the fourth and fifth [[lumbar]] [[vertebrae]] or between the fifth lumbar vertebra and first sacral segment are impinged.

In [[symptom]]atic cases the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] should be confirmed by an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan. However, in cases with slight symptoms, a faster and cheaper [[Computed axial tomography|CT]] scan (although it is inferior to MRI scan) may be recommended. While a CT scan can show the bony structures in more detail, an MRI scan can better portray soft tissue.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment in lumbar disc disease is one or two days of [[bedrest]] (although growing number of studies shows that it makes little difference) and [[Pain killer|pain relieving medications]]. In cases with ongoing pain despite conservative treatments, a [[surgery|surgical operation]] that will remove the compressing disc material, a microdiscectomy or [[discectomy]] may be recommended to treat a lumbar disc herniation.

==Genetics==
An inheritable gene variation may cause increased susceptibility.  People with a variation in a gene that encodes the [[cartilage]] intermediate-layer protein (CILP) were 1.6 times more likely to have the disease than persons without the variation.  CILP is a normal component of disc tissue.  The gene variation causes a version of CILP that disrupts normal building and maintenance of cartilage.

Under normal circumstances, CILP slows the activity of another [[protein]], [[TGF&beta;1]]. TGFβ1 regenerates the cartilage matrix tissue.  The variant CILP inhibits TGFβ1 to an abnormal degree, allowing for degeneration of the disc matrix. (Seki, ''et al.'', 2005)
