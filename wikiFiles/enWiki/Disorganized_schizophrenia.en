'''Disorganized schizophrenia''', also known as '''hebephrenia''', is a subtype of [[schizophrenia]], as defined in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], [[DSM-IV]] code 295.10.<ref>[http://hartsdalemedicalgroup.com/PatientPortal/MyPractice.aspx?UAID=%7B8EB8BBEF-153F-45F6-BEF7-416C0109E2FD%7D&ID=%7B44F989AB-2291-49F0-9BB5-35B58CB74E03%7D#4 Schizophrenia DSM]</ref>

Disorganized schizophrenia is thought to be an extreme expression of the ''disorganization syndrome'' that has been hypothesized to be one aspect of a three-factor model of symptoms in schizophrenia,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liddle PF |title=The symptoms of chronic schizophrenia. A re-examination of the positive-negative dichotomy |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue= 2|pages=145–51 |year=1987 |month=August |pmid=3690102 |doi=10.1192/bjp.151.2.145}}</ref> the other factors being ''reality distortion'' (involving delusions and hallucinations) and ''psychomotor poverty'' (poverty of speech, lack of spontaneous movement and various aspects of blunting of emotion).

==Presentation==
The prominent characteristics of this form are disorganized behavior and speech, (see [[formal thought disorder]]) including [[schizophasia]], and flat or inappropriate [[emotion]] and [[affect (psychology)|affect]]. In addition, [[psychiatrist]]s must rule out any possible sign of [[catatonic]] schizophrenia. The condition is also known as '''hebephrenia''', named after the Greek goddess of youth, [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], in reference to the typical age of onset in puberty.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Athanasiadis, Loukas |month=December |year=1997 |title=Greek mythology and medical and psychiatric terminology |journal=The Psychiatrist |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=781 |doi=10.1192/pb.21.12.781 |url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/21/12/781.pdf }}</ref>

Unlike paranoid schizophrenia, [[delusion]]s and [[hallucination]]s are not the most prominent feature,<ref>[http://schizophrenia.about.com/od/whatisschizophrenia/f/schiz_diagnosis.htm How Schizophrenia is diagnosed]</ref><ref>[http://counsellingresource.com/distress/schizophrenia/icd/hebephrenic.html Hebephrenic Schizophrenia Diagnostic Criteria]</ref> although fragmentary delusions and hallucinations may be present.

A person with disorganized schizophrenia may also experience behavioral disorganization which may impair his or her ability to carry out daily activities, such as showering or eating.<ref>American Psychiatric Association (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th edition). Washington, DC. code 295.10 pp314</ref>

The emotional responses of such people often seem strange or inappropriate. Inappropriate facial responses may be common, and behavior is sometimes described as 'silly', such as inappropriate laughter. Sometimes there is a complete lack of emotion, including [[anhedonia]] (the lack of [[pleasure]]), and [[avolition]] (a lack of motivation). Some of these features are also present in other types of schizophrenia, but they are most prominent in disorganized schizophrenia.

==Treatment==
This form of schizophrenia is typically associated with early onset (often between the ages of 15 and 25 years) and is thought to have a poor [[prognosis]] because of the rapid development of 'negative' symptoms and decline in social functioning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McGlashan TH, Fenton WS |title=Subtype progression and pathophysiologic deterioration in early schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=71–84 |year=1993 |pmid=8451614 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8451614 |doi=10.1093/schbul/19.1.71}}</ref>

Use of [[electroconvulsive therapy]] has been proposed;<ref name="pmid17187911">{{cite journal |author=Shimizu E, Imai M, Fujisaki M, ''et al.'' |title=Maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant disorganized schizophrenia |journal=Prog.
