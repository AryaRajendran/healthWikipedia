The '''Harvard School of Public Health''' is one of the professional [[graduate school]]s of [[Harvard University]], located in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area|Longwood Area]] of the [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] neighborhood of [[Mission Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Mission Hill]], which is next to [[Harvard Medical School]]. HSPH is considered a significant [[school]] focusing on health in the [[United States]]. Harvard School of Public Health grew out of the Harvard-[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] School for Health Officers, the nation's first graduate training program in population health, which was founded in 1913 and became Harvard School of Public Health in 1922. [[Julio Frenk]], the Minister of Health of [[Mexico]] from 2000 to 2006 and a former executive director of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), became the new dean of HSPH in January 2009.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/julio-frenk-named-next-dean-harvard-school-of-public-health.html Julio Frenk Named Next Dean of Harvard School of Public Health]</ref>

As one of the most selective public health schools in the world, the middle 50 percent of the class that entered in 2006 had an incoming GPA between 3.50 and 3.75 (out of 4.0).  About half of HSPH students already hold an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D. degree]], with many of the rest holding another advanced degree (typically a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[Juris Doctor|JD]], or [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]). HSPH students are drawn from around the world, with about 40 percent of the student body coming from outside of the United States.

Overall, HSPH is ranked third after the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health|University of North Carolina School of Public Health]] in the 2011, ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/hea/brief/pub_brief.php|title= Ranking of Best schools of Public Health in US by U.S. News & World Report].</ref> The [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] was ranked first in the same report. ''U.S. News'' consistently ranks Harvard #1 in Health Policy and Management.<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-public-affairs-schools/health-management]</ref>

The School's objectives are to provide the highest level of education to health scientists, practitioners, and leaders, to foster new discoveries leading to improved health for the people of this country and all nations, and to strengthen health capacities and services for communities.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/about.html#history]</ref>

==History==
The School traces its origins to the Harvard-MIT School for Health Officers, founded in 1913; Harvard calls it "the nation's first graduate training program in public health."  In 1922, the School for Health Officers became the Harvard School of Public Health, and in 1946 it was split off from the medical school and became a separate faculty of Harvard University.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/register/intro.html HSPH Catalog - Harvard School of Public Health]</ref>
