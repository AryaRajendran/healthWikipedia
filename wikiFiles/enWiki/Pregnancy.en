'''Pregnancy''' is the [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] and development of one or more offspring, known as an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]], in a woman's [[uterus]]. In a pregnancy, there can be multiple [[gestation]]s, as in the case of twins or [[Multiple birth|triplets]]. [[Childbirth]] usually occurs about 38 weeks after conception; in women who have a menstrual cycle length of four weeks, this is approximately 40 weeks from the start of the last normal menstrual period (LNMP). Human pregnancy is the most studied of all [[Pregnancy (mammals)|mammalian pregnancies]]. Conception can be achieved through [[sexual intercourse]] or [[assisted reproductive technology]].

An ''[[embryo]]'' is the developing offspring during the first 8 weeks following conception, and subsequently the term ''fetus'' is used until birth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3225 |title=Embryo definition |date=27 April 2011 |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3424 |title=Fetus definition |date=27 April 2011|publisher=MedicineNet, Inc}}</ref> 40% of pregnancies in the United States and United Kingdom are [[Unintended pregnancy|unplanned]], and between a quarter and half of those unplanned pregnancies were [[unwanted pregnancies]].<ref>{{cite news|title=40% of pregnancies 'unplanned'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3515400.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=16 March 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jayson|first=Sharon|title=Unplanned pregnancies in U.S. at 40 percent|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05-unplanned-pregnancies-percent.html|newspaper=[[PhysOrg.com]]|date=20 May 2011}}</ref> Of those unintended pregnancies that occurred in the US, 60% of the women used [[birth control]] to some extent during the month pregnancy occurred.<ref>{{cite book|authors=K.

In many societies' medical or legal definitions, human pregnancy is somewhat arbitrarily divided into three trimester periods, as a means to simplify reference to the different stages of [[prenatal development]]. The first trimester carries the highest risk of [[miscarriage]] (natural death of embryo or fetus). During the second trimester, the development of the fetus can be more easily monitored and diagnosed. The beginning of the third trimester often approximates the point of [[Point of fetal viability|viability]], or the ability of the fetus to survive, with or without medical help, outside of the [[uterus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11446 |title=Trimester definition |date=27 April 2011 |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc}}</ref> <!-- make footer reference (Though this can be controversial, depending on the age of the foetus and the discussed context.) -->
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
One scientific term for the state of pregnancy is ''gravidity'' (adjective ''"gravid"''), [[Latin]] for "heavy" and a pregnant female is sometimes referred to as a ''[[Gravidity|gravida]]''.<ref name = 'MFD'>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gravida |title=definition of gravida |accessdate=17 January 2008 |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}</ref> Similarly, the term ''[[Parity (medicine)|parity]]'' (abbreviated as "para") is used for the number of times a female has given birth, counting twins and other multiple births as one pregnancy, and usually including [[stillbirth]]s. Medically, a woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a ''nulligravida'', a woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time as a ''primigravida'',<ref name=TMHP>{{cite-TMHP|Primipara}}, page 596.</ref> and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a ''[[multigravida]]'' or ''multiparous.''<ref name = 'MFD' /><ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of nulligravida|url=http://medical.merriam-webster.com/medical/nulligravida|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster, Incorporated]]|accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Hence, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as ''gravida 2, para 1'' and upon live delivery as ''gravida 2, para 2.''  An in-progress pregnancy, as well as [[abortion]]s, [[miscarriage]]s, or [[stillbirth]]s account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of twins, triplets etc., gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as ''nulliparous.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15259 |title=Nulliparous definition |date=18 November 2000  |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc}}</ref>

==Progression==
[[File:Prenatal development table.svg|center|thumb|700px|Stages in [[prenatal development]], with weeks and months numbered from last menstrual period.]]

===Initiation===
[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]].]]
[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|Fertilization and implantation in humans.]]
Although pregnancy begins with [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], the process leading to pregnancy occurs earlier as the result of the female [[gamete]], or [[oocyte]], merging with the male gamete, [[spermatozoon]]. In medicine, this process is referred to as [[fertilization]]; in lay terms, it is more commonly known as "conception." After the point of [[fertilization]], the fused product of the female and male gamete is referred to as a [[zygote]] or fertilized egg. The fusion of male and female gametes usually occurs following the act of [[sexual intercourse]], resulting in ''spontaneous pregnancy''. However, the advent of [[assisted reproductive technology]] such as [[artificial insemination]] and [[in vitro fertilisation]] have made achieving pregnancy possible without engaging in sexual intercourse.  This approach may be undertaken as a voluntary choice or due to [[infertility]].

The process of fertilization occurs in several steps, and the interruption of any of them can lead to failure. Through fertilization, the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] is activated to begin its developmental process, and the [[haploid]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of the two gametes come together to form the [[genome]] of a new [[diploid]] [[organism]].

At the beginning of the process, the sperm undergoes a series of changes, as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize.<ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/fert/fert.html |title=Fertilization |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref> The sperm must undergo [[capacitation]] in the female's reproductive tract over several hours, which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane, preparing it for the [[acrosome reaction]], the enzymatic penetration of the egg's tough membrane, the [[zona pellucida]], which surrounds the oocyte.  The sperm and the egg cell, which has been released from one of the female's two [[ovaries]], unite in one of the two [[fallopian tubes]]. The fertilized egg, known as a [[zygote]], then moves toward the uterus, a journey that can take up to a week to complete. Cell division begins approximately 24 to 36 hours after the male and female cells unite.  Cell division continues at a rapid rate and the cells then develop into what is known as a [[blastocyst]]. The blastocyst is made up of three layers: the ectoderm (which will become the skin and nervous system), the endoderm (which will become the digestive and respiratory systems), and the mesoderm (which will become the muscle and skeletal systems).  Finally, the blastocyst arrives at the uterus and attaches to the uterine wall, a process known as [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

The mass of cells, now known as an embryo, begins the embryonic stage, which continues until cell differentiation is almost complete at eight weeks. Structures important to the support of the embryo develop, including the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]].  During this time, cells begin to differentiate into the various body systems. The basic outlines of the organ, body, and nervous systems are established. By the end of the embryonic stage, the beginnings of features such as fingers, eyes, mouth, and ears become visible.

Once cell differentiation is mostly complete, the embryo enters the final stage and becomes known as a fetus. The early body systems and structures that were established in the embryonic stage continue to develop. Sex organs begin to appear during the third month of gestation. The fetus continues to grow in both weight and length, although the majority of the physical growth occurs in the last weeks of pregnancy.

===Duration===
Healthcare professionals name three different dates as the start of pregnancy:  
* the first day of the woman's last normal [[menstrual period]], and the resulting fetal age is called the [[gestational age]]
* the date of conception (about two weeks before her ''next'' expected menstrual period), with the age called [[fertilization age]]
* the date of implantation (about one week after conception).

Since these are spread over a significant period of time, the duration of pregnancy necessarily depends on the date selected as the starting point chosen.

As measured on a [[reference group]] of women with a [[menstrual cycle]] of exactly 28-days prior to pregnancy, and who had spontaneous onset of labor, the mean pregnancy length has been estimated to be 283.4 days of [[gestational age]] as timed from the first day of the [[last menstrual period]] as recalled by the mother, and 280.6 days when the gestational age was retrospectively estimated by [[obstetric ultrasound]] measurement of the [[fetal biparietal diameter]] (BPD) in the second trimester.<ref name=Kieler2003/> Other algorithms take into account a variety of other variables, such as whether this is the first or subsequent child (i.e., pregnant woman is a primipara or a [[multipara]], respectively), the mother's race, parental age, length of menstrual cycle, and menstrual regularity), but these are rarely used by healthcare professionals.  In order to have a standard reference point, the normal pregnancy duration is generally assumed to be 280 days (or 40 weeks) of gestational age.

There is a [[standard deviation]] of 8–9 days surrounding due dates calculated with even the most accurate methods. This means that fewer than 5 percent of births occur on the day of being 40 weeks of gestational age; 50 percent of births are within a week of this duration, and about 80 percent are within 2 weeks.<ref name=Kieler2003>{{cite journal |author=Dr H. Kieler, O. Axelsson, S. Nilsson, U. Waldenströ|title=The length of human pregnancy as calculated by ultrasonographic measurement of the fetal biparietal diameter|journal=Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology|pages=353–357|volume=6|issue=5 |year=1995|doi=10.1046/j.1469-0705.1995.06050353.x|pmid=8590208}}</ref> It is much more useful and accurate, therefore, to consider a range of due dates, rather than one specific day, with some online due date calculators providing this information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spacefem.com/pregnant/due.php |title=Pregnancy Due Date Ranges |publisher=Spacefem.com |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

The most common system used among healthcare professionals is [[Naegele's rule]], which was developed in the early 19th century.  This calculates the expected due date from the first day of the last normal menstrual period (LMP or LNMP) regardless of factors known to make this inaccurate, such as a shorter or longer menstrual cycle length.  Pregnancy most commonly lasts for 40 weeks according to this LNMP-based method, assuming that the woman has a predictable menstrual cycle length of close to 28 days and conceives on the 14th day of that cycle

Accurate dating of pregnancy is important, because it is used in calculating the results of various [[Prenatal diagnosis|prenatal tests]], (for example, in the [[triple test]]). A decision may be made to [[Induction (birth)|induce]] labour if a fetus is perceived to be overdue. Furthermore, if LMP and ultrasound dating predict different respective due dates, with the latter being later, this might signify slowed fetal growth and therefore require closer review.

The age of [[fetal viability]] has been receding because of continued medical progress. Whereas it used to be 28 weeks, it has been brought back to as early as 23, or even 22 weeks in some countries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Preterm, term and postterm====
{{Further|Preterm birth|Postterm pregnancy}}
{{anchor|Term}}
Pregnancy is considered "at term" when gestation has lasted 37 complete weeks (occurring at the transition from the 37th to the 38th week of gestation), but is less than 42 weeks of gestational age (occurring at the transition from the 42nd week to the 43rd week of gestation, or between 259 and 294 days since LMP). "''Full term''" refers to the gestation having lasted 40 [[week]]s from the first day of the mother's last [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]]. This is the end of gestation on average. Alternatively expressed, this corresponds to a [[gestational age]] of 40 weeks and 0 days, or 280 days, or approximately 9 months, and occurs at the transition from the 40th to the 41st week of gestation. On average, it corresponds to an [[embryonic age]] of 38 weeks or 266 days.

Events before completion of 37 weeks (259 days) are considered [[Premature birth|preterm]]; from week 42 (294 days) events are considered [[Postmature birth|postterm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preventioninstitute.sk.ca/home/Program_Areas/Maternal__Infant_Health/Definitions/ |title=Definitions |accessdate=16 January 2008 |publisher=Saskatchewan Prevention Institute. }}</ref> When a pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks (294 days), the risk of complications for both the woman and the fetus increases significantly.<ref name="UpToDate">{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics |title=Postterm Pregnancy (Beyond the Basics) |accessdate=24 August 2012 |last=Norwitz, MD, PhD |first=Errol R. |publisher=UpToDate, Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZRDLPH97C&sub_cat=2005 |title=What To Expect After Your Due Date |accessdate=16 January 2008 |author=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |month=April | year=2006 |work=Medem |publisher=Medem, Inc.}}</ref> Therefore, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, obstetricians usually prefer to [[induce labour]] at some stage between 41 and 42 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/public/pdf/rcog_induction_of_labour.pdf |title=Induction of labour – Evidence-based Clinical Guideline Number 9|accessdate=18 January 2008 |year=2001 |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061230063449/http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/public/pdf/rcog_induction_of_labour.pdf |archivedate = 30 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.durhamobgyn.com/viewArticle?ID=336380 |title=Postdate Pregnancy  |accessdate=18 January 2008 |last=Stovall, M.D. |first=Thomas G. |date=23 March 2004 |work=Durham Obstetrics and Gynecology |publisher=Durham Obstetrics and Gynecology}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Recent medical literature prefers the terminology ''preterm'' and ''postterm'' to ''premature'' and ''postmature.'' ''Preterm'' and ''postterm'' are unambiguously defined as above, whereas ''premature'' and ''postmature'' have historical meaning and relate more to the infant's size and state of development rather than to the stage of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11895 |title=Definition of Premature birth |accessdate=16 January 2008 |publisher=Medicine.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.discovery.com/encyclopedias/illnesses.html?article=2728 |title=Premature Infant |accessdate=16 January 2008 |author=Lama Rimawi, MD |date=22 September 2006 |work=Disease & Conditions Encyclopedia |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.}}</ref>

===Childbirth===
{{Main|Childbirth}}
Childbirth is the process whereby an infant is born.

A woman is considered to be in labour when she begins experiencing regular uterine contractions, accompanied by changes of her cervix – primarily effacement and dilation. While childbirth is widely experienced as painful, some women do report painless labours, while others find that concentrating on the birth helps to quicken labour and lessen the sensations. Most births are successful vaginal births, but sometimes complications arise and a woman may undergo a [[cesarean section]].

During the time immediately after birth, both the mother and the baby are hormonally cued to bond, the mother through the release of [[oxytocin]], a hormone also released during [[breastfeeding]].  Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both the mother and baby.  A review done by the [[World Health Organization]] found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother-infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully.  They recommend that [[neonates]] be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life.<ref>[http://apps.who.int/rhl/newborn/gpcom/en/index.html WHO | Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Postnatal period===
{{Main|Postnatal}}
The postnatal period begins immediately after the birth of a child and then extends for about six weeks. During this period, the mother's body begins the return to prepregnancy conditions that includes changes in hormone levels and uterus size.

==Diagnosis==
The beginning of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms by the pregnant woman herself, or by using medical tests with or without the assistance of a medical professional. Approximately 1 in 475 women at 20 weeks, and 1 in 2500 women at delivery, refuse to acknowledge that they are pregnant, which is called ''[[denial of pregnancy]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=A|coauthors=Millar, S; Robins, J|title=Denial of pregnancy: a literature review and discussion of ethical and legal issues.|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=2011 Jul|volume=104|issue=7|pages=286–91|pmid=21725094}}</ref> Some non-pregnant women have a very strong belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes.<!-- <ref name=Gabbe2012> --> This condition is known as [[pseudocyesis]] or false pregnancy.<ref name=Gabbe2012>{{cite book|last=Gabbe|first=Steven|title=Obstetrics : normal and problem pregnancies|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781437719352|page=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=-3ufSTqeb6cC&pg=PA1184 1184]|edition=6th ed.}}</ref>

===Physical signs===
[[File:Linea nigra.jpg|thumb|[[Linea nigra]] in a woman at 22 weeks pregnant.]]
Most pregnant women experience a number of symptoms,<ref name="pregnancy symptoms">{{cite web | title = Pregnancy Symptoms | url = http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/sexandyoungpeople/pages/amipregnant.aspx | publisher = [[National Health Service (NHS)]] | date = 11 March 2010 | accessdate =11 March 2010 }}</ref> which can signify pregnancy. The symptoms can include nausea and vomiting, excessive tiredness and fatigue, [[Food craving|cravings]] for certain foods that are not normally sought out, and frequent urination particularly during the night.

A number of early [[medical sign]]s are associated with pregnancy.<ref name="mayo symptoms">{{cite web | title = Early symptoms of pregnancy: What happens right away | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptoms-of-pregnancy/PR00102 | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]] | date = 22 February 2007 | accessdate =22 August 2007 }}</ref><ref name="American Pregnancy Association">{{cite web |url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/earlypregnancysymptoms.html |title=Pregnancy Symptoms – Early Signs of Pregnancy : American Pregnancy Association |accessdate=16 January 2008 }}</ref> These signs typically appear, if at all, within the first few weeks after conception. Although not all of these signs are universally present, nor are all of them diagnostic by themselves, taken together they make a presumptive diagnosis of pregnancy.  These signs include the presence of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) in the blood and urine, missed [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]], implantation bleeding that occurs at [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of the embryo in the uterus during the third or fourth week after last menstrual period, increased [[basal body temperature]] sustained for over 2 weeks after [[ovulation]], [[Chadwick's sign]] (darkening of the [[cervix]], [[vagina]], and [[vulva]]), [[Goodell's sign]] (softening of the vaginal portion of the cervix), [[Hegar's sign]] (softening of the [[uterus]] [[isthmus]]), and pigmentation of linea alba – [[Linea nigra]], (darkening of the skin in a midline of the [[abdomen]], caused by [[hyperpigmentation]] resulting from hormonal changes, usually appearing around the middle of pregnancy).<ref name="mayo symptoms"/><ref name="American Pregnancy Association"/> [[Breast tenderness]] is common during the first trimester, and is more common in women who are pregnant at a young age.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003152.htm MedlinePlus > Breast pain] Update Date: 31 December 2008. Updated by: David C. Dugdale, Susan Storck. Also reviewed by David Zieve.</ref>

Despite all the signs, some women may not realize they are pregnant until they are far along in pregnancy. In some cases, a few have not been aware of their pregnancy until they begin [[Childbirth|labour]]. This can be caused by many factors, including irregular periods (quite common in teenagers), certain medications (not related to conceiving children), and [[obese]] women who disregard their weight gain. Others may be in [[Pregnancy denial|denial]] of their situation.

===Tests===
Pregnancy detection can be accomplished using one or more various [[pregnancy test]]s,<ref name="pregnancy">{{cite web | title = NHS Pregnancy Planner | url = http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/Pregnancycareplanner | publisher = [[National Health Service (NHS)]] | date = 19 March 2010 | accessdate =19 March 2010 }}</ref> which detect hormones generated by the newly formed [[placenta]]. Blood and urine tests can detect pregnancy 12 days after implantation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02066422 |author=Qasim SM, Callan C, Choe JK |title=The predictive value of an initial serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin level for pregnancy outcome following in vitro fertilization |journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=705–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8947817 }}</ref> Blood pregnancy tests are more sensitive than urine tests (giving fewer false negatives).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=936 |title=BestBets: Serum or Urine beta-hCG? }}</ref> Home [[pregnancy test]]s are [[urine]] tests, and normally detect a pregnancy 12 to 15 days after fertilization. A quantitative blood test can determine approximately the date the embryo was conceived. Testing 48 hours apart can provide useful information regarding how the pregnancy is doing. A single test of [[progesterone]] levels can also help determine how likely a fetus will survive in those with a [[threatened miscarriage]] (bleeding in early pregnancy).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verhaegen|first=J|coauthors=Gallos, ID; van Mello, NM; Abdel-Aziz, M; Takwoingi, Y; Harb, H; Deeks, JJ; Mol, BW; Coomarasamy, A|title=Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2012 Sep 27|volume=345|pages=e6077|pmid=23045257}}</ref> 

An early [[obstetric ultrasonography]] can determine the age of the pregnancy fairly accurately. In practice, medical professionals typically express the age of a pregnancy (i.e., an "age" for an [[embryo]]) in terms of "menstrual date" based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, as the woman reports it. Unless a woman's recent [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] has been limited, she has been charting her cycles, or the conception is the result of some types of [[fertility treatment]] (such as [[IUI]] or [[IVF]]), the exact date of fertilization is unknown. Without symptoms such as [[morning sickness]], often the only visible sign of a pregnancy is an interruption of the woman's normal monthly menstruation cycle, (i.e., a "late period"). Hence, the "menstrual date" is simply a common educated estimate for the age of a fetus, which is an average of 2 weeks later than the first day of the woman's last menstrual period. The term "conception date" may sometimes be used when that date is more certain, though even medical professionals can be imprecise with their use of the two distinct terms. The due date can be calculated by using [[Naegele's rule]].  The expected date of delivery may also be calculated from [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] measurement of the fetus. This method is slightly more accurate than methods based on LMP.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Evaluation of ultrasound-estimated date of delivery in 17 450 spontaneous singleton births: do we need to modify Naegele's rule? | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1469-0705.1999.14010023.x | journal = Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–28 | last = Nguyen | first = T.H. | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 1999 | accessdate =18 August 2007 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-0705.1999.14010023.x | format = abstract | pmid = 10461334 }}</ref> Additional [[obstetrics|obstetric]] diagnostic techniques can estimate the health and presence or absence of [[congenital disease]]s at an early stage.

===Ultrasound===

==Physiology==
[[File:Breast changes during pregnancy 1.png|thumb|400px|Breast changes as seen during pregnancy. Note the increase in size and darkening of the areola.]]
Pregnancy is typically broken into three periods, or trimesters, each of about three months.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trimester trimester]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 26 November 2012.
</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/trimester thefreedictionary.com > trimester] Citing:
*The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, copyright 2000
</ref>  Obstetricians define each trimester as lasting for 14 weeks, resulting in a total duration of 42 weeks, although the average duration of pregnancy is actually about 40 weeks.<ref>Cunningham, et al., (2010). Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, chapter 8.</ref> While there are no hard and fast rules, these distinctions are useful in describing the changes that take place over time.

===First trimester===
Traditionally, medical professionals have measured pregnancy from a number of convenient points, including the day of last menstruation, ovulation, fertilization, implantation and chemical detection. In medicine, pregnancy is often defined as beginning when the developing [[embryo]] becomes [[Implantation (human embryo)|implanted]] in the [[endometrium|endometrial]] lining of a woman's [[uterus]]. Most pregnant women do not have any specific signs or symptoms of implantation, although it is not uncommon to experience minimal bleeding.  After implantation, the uterine endometrium is called the [[decidua]]. The [[placenta]], which is formed partly from the decidua and partly from outer layers of the embryo, connects the developing embryo to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply. The [[umbilical cord]] is the connecting cord from the embryo or fetus to the placenta. The developing embryo undergoes tremendous growth and changes during the process of [[fetal development]].

[[Morning sickness]] occurs in about seventy percent of all pregnant women, and typically improves after the first trimester.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.signs-of-pregnancy-week-by-week.com/early-pregnancy-symptoms.html | title=Early pregnancy symptoms: Morning sickness, fatigue and other common symptoms|accessdate=2011}}</ref> Although described as "morning sickness", women can experience this nausea during afternoon, evening, and throughout the entire day.

Shortly after conception, the nipples and areolas begin to darken due to a temporary increase in hormones.<ref name="pregnancy video">{{cite web|url=http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/education/about/pregnancy|title=Pregnancy video|accessdate=22 January 2009|publisher=Channel 4|year=2008}}</ref>  This process continues throughout the pregnancy.

The first 12 weeks of pregnancy are considered to make up the first trimester. The first two weeks from the first trimester are calculated as the first two weeks of pregnancy even though the pregnancy does not actually exist. These two weeks are the two weeks before conception and include the woman's last [[Menstruation|period]].

The third week is the week in which fertilization occurs and the 4th week is the period when [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] takes place. In the 4th week, the fecundated egg reaches the [[uterus]] and burrows into its wall which provides it with the [[nutrients]] it needs. At this point, the zygote becomes a [[blastocyst]] and the [[placenta]] starts to form. Moreover, most of the pregnancy tests may detect a pregnancy beginning with this week.

The 5th week marks the start of the [[embryonic period]]. This is when the embryo's [[human brain|brain]], [[spinal cord]], [[human heart|heart]] and other organs begin to form.<ref name="D">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prenatal-care/PR00112/NSECTIONGROUP=2 |title=Pregnancy week by week|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>  At this point the embryo is made up of three layers, of which the top one (called the [[ectoderm]]) will give rise to the embryo's outermost layer of skin, central and peripheral [[nervous system]]s, [[human eyes|eyes]], [[inner ear]], and many [[Connective Tissues|connective tissues]].<ref name="D"/> The heart and the beginning of the [[circulatory system]] as well as the [[bone]]s, [[muscles]] and [[kidneys]] are made up from the [[mesoderm]] (the middle layer). The inner layer of the embryo will serve as the starting point for the development of the [[lungs]], [[intestine]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]]. This layer is referred to as the [[endoderm]]. An embryo at 5 weeks is normally between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|in|mm}} in length.

In the 6th week, the embryo will be developing basic facial features and its arms and legs start to grow. At this point, the embryo is usually no longer than {{convert|1/6|to|1/4|in|mm}}. In the following week, the brain, face and arms and legs quickly develop. In the 8th week, the embryo starts moving and in the next 3 weeks, the embryo's toes, [[neck]] and [[Genitals#Genitals|genitals]] develop as well. According to the American Pregnancy Association, by the end of the first trimester, the [[fetus]] will be about {{convert|3|in}} long and will weigh approximately {{convert|1|oz}}.<ref name="E">{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancybegins.com/week-by-week.php |title=Pregnancy Week by week Symptoms |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref> Once pregnancy moves into the second trimester, all the risks of miscarriage and birth defects occurring drop drastically.
Progesterone has noticeable effects on respiratory physiology, increasing minute ventilation by 40% in the first trimester.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=LA|coauthors=Klocke, RA|title=Implications for the pregnant patient.|journal=American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine|date=2001 Apr|volume=163|issue=5|pages=1051–4|pmid=11316633}}</ref>

===Second trimester===
[[File:Pregnancy 26 weeks 1.jpg|upright|thumb|By the end of the second trimester, the expanding uterus has created a visible "baby bump". Although the breasts have been developing internally since the beginning of the pregnancy, most of the visible changes appear after this point.]]
Weeks 13 to 28 of the pregnancy are called the second trimester. Most women feel more energized in this period, and begin to put on weight as the symptoms of morning sickness subside and eventually fade away. The uterus, the muscular organ that holds the developing fetus, can expand up to 20 times its normal size during pregnancy.

Although the [[fetus]] begins to move and takes a recognizable human shape during the first trimester, it is not until the second trimester that movement of the fetus, often referred to as "[[quickening]]", can be felt. This typically happens in the fourth month, more specifically in the 20th to 21st week, or by the 19th week if the woman has been pregnant before. However, it is not uncommon for some women not to feel the fetus move until much later. The placenta fully functions at this time and the fetus makes [[insulin]] and urinates. The reproductive organs distinguish the fetus as male or female. During the second trimester, most women begin to wear [[maternity clothes]].

===Third trimester===
[[File:Pregnancy comparison.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of growth of the abdomen between 26 weeks and 40 weeks gestation.]]
Final weight gain takes place, which is the most weight gain throughout the pregnancy. The fetus will be growing the most rapidly during this stage, gaining up to 28&nbsp;g per day. The woman's belly will transform in shape as the belly drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth. During the second trimester, the woman's belly would have been very upright, whereas in the third trimester it will drop down quite low, and the woman will be able to lift her belly up and down. The fetus begins to move regularly, and is felt by the woman. Fetal movement can become quite strong and be disruptive to the woman. The woman's [[navel]] will sometimes become convex, "popping" out, due to her expanding [[abdomen]]. This period of her pregnancy can be uncomfortable, causing symptoms like weak bladder control and backache. Movement of the fetus becomes stronger and more frequent and via improved brain, eye, and muscle function the fetus is prepared for ''ex utero'' viability. The woman can feel the fetus "rolling" and it may cause pain or discomfort when it is near the woman's ribs and spine.

[[File:Grossesse.jpg|thumb|right|1858 engraving of a pregnant woman showing the fetus in the womb]]

There is ''head engagement'' in the third trimester, that is, the fetal head descends into the [[pelvic cavity]] so that only a small part (or none) of it can be felt abdominally. The perenium and cervix are further flattened and the head may be felt vaginally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancy-bliss.co.uk/headengagement.html|publisher=pregnancy-bliss.co.uk|title=Starting labour|accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref> Head engagement is known colloquially as the ''baby drop''<!--Difficult to get Wikipedia search results for "baby drop," and "lightening" redirects to "lightning."-->, and in natural medicine as the ''lightening'' because of the release of pressure on the upper abdomen and renewed ease in breathing. However, it severely reduces bladder capacity, increases pressure on the pelvic floor and the rectum, and the mother may experience the perpetual sensation that the fetus will "fall out" at any moment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lightening During Pregnancy as an Early Sign of Labor|url=http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/lightening-during-pregnancy.html|accessdate=22 August 2010|publisher=Giving Birth Naturally}}</ref> It is also during the third trimester that maternal activity and sleep positions may affect fetal development due to restricted blood flow. For instance, the enlarged uterus may impede blood flow by compressing the lower pressured [[vena cava]], with the left lateral laying positions appearing to providing better oxygenation to the infant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stacey|first=T|coauthors=Thompson, JM; Mitchell, EA; Ekeroma, AJ; Zuccollo, JM; McCowan, LM|title=Association between maternal sleep practices and risk of late stillbirth: a case-control study.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2011 Jun 14|volume=342|pages=d3403|pmid=21673002}}</ref>

It is during this time that a baby born [[Premature birth|prematurely]] may survive. The use of modern medical [[intensive care]] technology has greatly increased the probability of premature babies surviving, and has pushed back the boundary of viability to much earlier dates than would be possible without assistance.<ref name="Iams">{{cite journal|last=Iams|first=JD|coauthors=Romero, R; Culhane, JF; Goldenberg, RL|title=Primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of preterm birth.|journal=Lancet|date=2008 Jan 12|volume=371|issue=9607|pages=164–75|pmid=18191687}}</ref> In spite of these developments, premature birth remains a major threat to the fetus, and may result in ill health in later life, even if the baby survives.

===Prenatal development===
{{See also|Prenatal development}}
Prenatal development is divided into two primary biological stages. The first is the [[embryo|embryonic stage]], which lasts for about two months. At this point, the [[fetus|fetal stage]] begins. At the beginning of the fetal stage, the risk of miscarriage decreases sharply,<ref name=sharply>• [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2176898.stm Q&A: Miscarriage]. (6 August 2002). ''BBC News.''

When the fetal stage commences, a fetus is typically about 30&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;inches) in length, and the heart can be seen beating via ultrasound; the fetus can be seen making various involuntary motions at this stage.<ref name="Prechtl">{{cite book|last=Kalverboer|first=edited by Alex F.|title=Brain and behaviour in human development|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9780792369431|pages=415–418|url=http://books.google.ca/books?vid=ISBN0792369432&id=FzyPozUyKPkC&pg=RA1-PA416|coauthors=Gramsbergen, Albert}}</ref>

Electrical [[brain activity]] is first detected between the 5th and 6th week of gestation, though this is still considered primitive neural activity rather than the beginning of conscious thought, something that develops much later in fetation. Synapses begin forming at 17 weeks, and at about week 28 begin to multiply at a rapid pace which continues until 3 to 4 months after birth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Illes|first=ed. by Judy|title=Neuroethics : defining the issues in theory, practice, and policy|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198567219|pages=142|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=m7USFu5Z0lQC&pg=PA142|edition=Repr.}}</ref>

===Physiological changes===
{{Main|Maternal physiological changes in pregnancy}}
[[File:Melasmablemish.jpg|thumb|[[Melasma]] pigment changes to the face due to pregnancy]]
During pregnancy, the woman undergoes many [[physiology|physiological]] changes, which are entirely normal, including [[cardiovascular]], [[hematology|hematologic]], [[metabolism|metabolic]], [[renal]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] changes that become very important in the event of complications. The body must change its physiological and homeostatic mechanisms in pregnancy to ensure the fetus is provided for. Increases in blood sugar, breathing and cardiac output are all required. Levels of progesterone and oestrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the hypothalamic axis and subsequently the menstrual cycle.

Many women and medical professionals<ref>{{cite book|last=Lauersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Complete Book of Breast Care|year=1998|publisher=Fawcett Columbine/Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=978-0-449-91241-6|edition=1st Trade Paperback|coauthors=Stukane, Eileen }}</ref><ref name=ayurved>{{cite web|title=Breast Sagging|url=http://www.ayurvediccure.com/breast_sagging_shapes.htm|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>  mistakenly think that [[breastfeeding]] causes their breasts to [[Ptosis (breasts)|sag]] (medically referred to as ''ptosis''),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sagging Breasts|url=http://www.channel4embarrassingillnesses.com/conditions/sagging-breasts/|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=3 February 2012|year=2009}}</ref> and as a result some are reluctant to nurse their infants. In February 2009, [[Cheryl Cole]] told British [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] that she hesitated to breastfeed because of the effect it might have on her breasts.

== Management ==
{{Main|Prenatal care|pre-conception counseling}}
Prenatal medical care is the medical and nursing care recommended for women [[Pre-conception counseling|before]]  and [[prenatal care|during]] pregnancy. The aim of good prenatal care is to identify any potential problems early, to prevent them if possible (through recommendations on adequate nutrition, exercise, vitamin intake etc.), and to manage problems, possibly by directing the woman to appropriate specialists, hospitals, etc. if necessary.

===Nutrition===
{{Main|Nutrition and pregnancy}}
A balanced, nutritious diet is an important aspect of a healthy pregnancy.  Eating a healthy diet, balancing [[carbohydrates]], fat, and [[proteins]], and eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, usually ensures good nutrition.  Those whose diets are affected by health issues, religious requirements, or ethical beliefs may choose to consult a health professional for specific advice.

Adequate periconceptional [[folic acid]] (also called folate or Vitamin B<sub>9</sub>) intake has been shown to decrease the risk of fetal neural tube defects such as [[spina bifida]], a serious [[birth defect]].  The neural tube develops during the first 28 days of pregnancy, explaining the necessity to guarantee adequate periconceptional folate intake.<ref name="pmid16303691">{{cite journal |author=Klusmann A, Heinrich B, Stöpler H, Gärtner J, Mayatepek E, Von Kries R |title=A decreasing rate of neural tube defects following the recommendations for periconceptional folic acid supplementation |journal=Acta Paediatr. |volume=94 |issue=11 |pages=1538–42 |year=2005 |pmid=16303691 |doi=10.1080/08035250500340396 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0803-5253&date=2005&volume=94&issue=11&spage=1538 |accessdate=20 January 2008}}</ref><ref name="pmid11015508">{{cite journal |author=Stevenson RE, Allen WP, Pai GS, Best R, Seaver LH, Dean J, Thompson S |title=Decline in prevalence of neural tube defects in a high-risk region of the United States |journal=Pediatrics |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=677–83 |year=2000 |pmid=11015508 |doi=10.1542/peds.106.4.677}}</ref> Folate (from ''folia'', leaf) is abundant in [[spinach]] (fresh, frozen, or canned), and is found in [[green vegetables|green leafy vegetables]] e.g. salads, beets, broccoli, asparagus, citrus fruits and melons, chickpeas (i.e. in the form of [[hummus]] or [[falafel]]), and [[Egg (food)|eggs]].

[[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA omega-3]] is a major structural fatty acid in the brain and retina, and is naturally found in breast milk. It is important for the woman to consume adequate amounts of DHA during pregnancy and while nursing to support her well-being and the health of her infant.  Developing infants cannot produce DHA efficiently, and must receive this vital nutrient from the woman through the placenta during pregnancy and in breast milk after birth.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salem N|first=Jr|coauthors=Litman, B; Kim, HY; Gawrisch, K|title=Mechanisms of action of docosahexaenoic acid in the nervous system.|journal=Lipids|date=2001 Sep|volume=36|issue=9|pages=945–59|pmid=11724467}}</ref>

Dangerous bacteria or parasites may contaminate foods, including ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. Careful washing of fruits and raw vegetables may remove these pathogens, as may thoroughly cooking leftovers, meat, or processed meat.  Soft cheeses may contain ''Listeria''; if milk is raw, the risk may increase. Cat feces pose a particular risk of [[toxoplasmosis]]. Pregnant women are also more prone to ''[[Salmonella]]'' infections from eggs and poultry, which should be thoroughly cooked.

===Weight gain===
Caloric intake should be increased to ensure proper development of the fetus. The amount of weight gained during a single pregnancy varies.

During pregnancy, insufficient or excessive weight gain can compromise the health of the mother and fetus. Women are encouraged to choose a healthy diet regardless of pre-pregnancy weight. Exercise during pregnancy, such as walking and swimming, is recommended for healthy pregnancies. Exercise has notable health benefits for both mother and baby, including preventing excessive weight gain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pregnancy-and-exercise/PR00096 |title=Pregnancy and Exercise: Baby Let's Move! |accessdate=29 July 2010| work=Mayo Clinic}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=WADSWORTH|first=P|title=The Benefits of Exercise in Pregnancy|journal=The Journal for Nurse Practitioners|date=1 May 2007|volume=3|issue=5|pages=333–339|doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2007.03.002|url=http://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(07)00212-7/abstract}}</ref>

===Medication use===
{{Main|Drugs in pregnancy}}
Drugs used during pregnancy can have temporary or permanent effects on the fetus. Therefore many physicians would prefer not to prescribe for pregnant women, the major concern being over [[teratogen]]icity of the drugs.

Drugs have been classified into categories A,B,C,D and X based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rating system to provide therapeutic guidance based on potential benefits and fetal risks. Drugs, including some [[multivitamins]], that have demonstrated no fetal risks after controlled studies in humans are classified as Category A. On the other hand drugs like [[thalidomide]] with proven fetal risks that outweigh all benefits are classified as Category X.<ref name="reena shaji">{{cite web|last=Shaji|first=Reena|title=Drugs in pregnancy and teratogenicity|url=http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/525/drugs-pregnancy-and-teratogenicity|publisher=LifeHugger|date=13 January 2009}}</ref>

=== Exposure to toxins ===
Various toxins pose a significant hazard to fetuses during development. A 2011 study found that virtually all U.S. pregnant women carry multiple chemicals, including some banned since the 1970s, in their bodies. Researchers detected [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], [[organochlorine pesticides]], [[perfluorinated compounds]], [[phenols]], [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]], [[phthalates]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[perchlorate]] PBDEs, compounds used as flame retardants, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a pesticide banned in the United States in 1972, in the bodies of 99 to 100 percent of the pregnant women they tested.  [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA) was identified in 96 percent of the women surveyed. Several of the chemicals were at the same concentrations that have been associated with negative effects in children from other studies and it is thought that exposure to multiple chemicals can have a greater impact than exposure to only one substance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110114081653.htm |title=99% of pregnant women in US test positive for multiple chemicals including banned ones, study suggests |doi=10.1289/ehp.1002727 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>{{MEDCN|date=March 2013}}

*Alcohol ingestion during pregnancy may cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], a permanent and often devastating birth-defect syndrome. A number of studies have shown that light to moderate drinking during pregnancy might not pose a risk to the fetus, although no amount of alcohol during pregnancy can be guaranteed to be absolutely safe.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ornoy|first=A|coauthors=Ergaz, Z|title=Alcohol abuse in pregnant women: effects on the fetus and newborn, mode of action and maternal treatment.|journal=International journal of environmental research and public health|date=2010 Feb|volume=7|issue=2|pages=364–79|pmid=20616979}}</ref>

*Elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[methylmercury]] are two forms of mercury that may pose risks in pregnancy.  Methylmercury, a worldwide contaminant of seafood and freshwater fish, is known to produce adverse nervous system effects, especially during brain development.  Eating fish is the main source of mercury exposure in humans and some fish may contain enough mercury to harm the developing nervous system of an embryo or fetus, sometimes leading to learning disabilities.<ref name=Abelsohn>{{cite journal|last=Abelsohn|first=A|coauthors=Vanderlinden, LD; Scott, F; Archbold, JA; Brown, TL|title=Healthy fish consumption and reduced mercury exposure: counseling women in their reproductive years.|journal=Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien|date=2011 Jan|volume=57|issue=1|pages=26–30|pmid=21322285}}</ref> Mercury is present in many types of fish, but it is mostly found in certain large fish.

*The developing nervous system of the fetus is particularly vulnerable to lead toxicity. Neurological toxicity is observed in children of exposed women as a result of the ability of lead to cross the placental barrier. A special concern for pregnant women is that some of the bone lead accumulation is released into the blood during pregnancy. Several studies have provided evidence that even low maternal exposures to lead produce intellectual and behavioral deficits in children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/c1-98112.html |title=Chapter 1, Lead-based Paint Hazards, 98–112 |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Sexual activity ===

Some individuals are sexually attracted to pregnant women ([[pregnancy fetishism]], also known as [[maiesiophilia]]).

Sex during pregnancy is a low-risk behavior except when the healthcare provider advises that sexual intercourse be avoided for particular medical reasons. Otherwise, for a healthy pregnant woman who is not ill or weak, there is no ''safe'' or ''right'' way to have sex during pregnancy: it is enough to apply the common sense rule that both partners avoid putting pressure on the uterus, or a partner's full weight on a pregnant belly.<ref>

===Exercise===
Regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy appears to improve (or maintain) physical fitness; however, the quality of the research is poor and the data was insufficient to infer important risks or benefits for the mother or infant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kramer|first=MS|coauthors=McDonald, SW|title=Aerobic exercise for women during pregnancy|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=19 July 2006|volume=3|pages=CD000180|pmid=16855953|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16855953|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000180.pub2|editor1-last=Kramer|editor1-first=Michael S|issue=3}}</ref>

The Clinical Practice Obstetrics Committee of Canada recommends that "All women without contraindications should be encouraged to participate in aerobic and strength-conditioning exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle during their pregnancy". Although an upper level of safe exercise intensity has not been established, women who were regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have uncomplicated, healthy pregnancies should be able to engage in high intensity exercise programs, such as jogging and aerobics for less than 45 minutes, with no adverse effects if they are mindful of the possibility that they may need to increase their energy intake and are careful to not become overheated.  In the absence of either medical or obstetric complications, they advise an accumulation of 30 minutes a day of exercise on most if not all days of the week. In general, participation in a wide range of recreational activities appears to be safe, with the avoidance of those with a high risk of falling such as horseback riding or sking or those that carry a risk of abdominal trauma, such as soccer or hockey.<ref name=pmid_1724598>{{cite journal|last=Artal|first=R|coauthors=O'Toole, M|title=Guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period.|journal=British journal of sports medicine|date=2003 Feb|volume=37|issue=1|pages=6–12; discussion 12|pmid=12547738}}</ref>

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reports that in the past, the main concerns of exercise in pregnancy were focused on the fetus and any potential maternal benefit was thought to be offset by potential risks to the fetus. However, they write that more recent information suggests that in the uncomplicated pregnancy, fetal injuries are highly unlikely.  They do, however, list several circumstances when a woman should contact her health care provider before continuing with an exercise program.  Contraindications include: 
Vaginal bleeding, [[dyspnea]] before exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, muscle weakness, preterm labor, decreased fetal movement, amniotic fluid leakage, and calf pain or swelling (to rule out [[thrombophlebitis]]).

==Complications==
{{Main|Complications of pregnancy}}

Each year, according to the WHO, ill-health as a result of pregnancy is experienced (sometimes permanently) by more than 20 million women around the world. Furthermore, the "lives of eight million women are threatened, and more than 500,000 women are estimated to have died in 1995 as a result of causes related to pregnancy and childbirth."<ref name="WHO Reproductive Health and Research Publications: Making Pregnancy Safer">{{cite web|url=http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section13/Section36/Section129/Section396_1450.htm|title=Reproductive Health and Research Publications: Making Pregnancy Safer|year=2009|publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for South-East Asia|accessdate=7 December 2009}}</ref>

Pregnancy poses varying levels of [[Risk factors in pregnancy|health risk for women]], depending on their medical profile before pregnancy.

The following are some of the complaints that may occur during and/or after pregnancy due to the many changes which pregnancy causes in a woman's body:

===Ectopic pregnancy===
{{main|Ectopic pregnancy}}

An ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo implants outside the uterine cavity.<ref>{{cite book |author=Page EW, Villee CA, Villee DB |title=Human Reproduction, 2nd Edition |publisher= W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1976| isbn=0-7216-7042-3 |page=211}}</ref> With rare exceptions, ectopic pregnancies are not [[:wikt:viable|viable]].  Most  ectopic pregnancies occur in the [[Fallopian tube]] (so-called tubal pregnancies), but implantation can also occur in the [[cervix]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and [[abdomen]].  It should be considered in any woman with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding who has a positive [[pregnancy test]]. An [[ultrasound]] showing a [[gestational sac]] with fetal heart in a location other than the uterine cavity is clear evidence of an ectopic pregnancy. Tubal ectopic pregnancy is the most common cause of maternal death in the first trimester of pregnancy.<ref name=PMC2880914>{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=J. L. V.|coauthors=Dey, S. K., Critchley, H. O. D., Horne, A. W.|title=Current knowledge of the aetiology of human tubal ectopic pregnancy|journal=Human Reproduction Update|year=2010|month=January|volume=16|issue=4|pages=432–444|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp057|pmc=2880914|pmid=20071358}}</ref>

About 1% of pregnancies are in an ectopic location with implantation not occurring inside of the womb, and of these 98% occur in the Fallopian tubes.<ref name=PMC2880914 />  In a typical ectopic pregnancy, the embryo adheres to the lining of the fallopian tube and burrows into the tubal lining.  Most commonly this invades blood vessels which causes bleeding resulting in the expulsion of  the implantation from the tube.  Termed "tubal abortions", about half of ectopic pregnancies will resolve without treatment. The use of [[methotrexate]] treatment for ectopic pregnancy has reduced the need for surgery, but surgical intervention is still required in cases where the Fallopian tube has ruptured or is in danger of doing so. The surgical intervention may be [[laparoscopic]] or through a larger incision, known as a [[laparotomy]].<ref>[https://www.laparoscopyhospital.com/helpdesk/support/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/10/0/laparoscopic-ectopic-pregnancy-surgery Laparoscopic Ectopic Pregnancy Surgery - Powered by World Laparoscopy Hospital<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A woman who has had a previous ectopic pregnancy is more likely to have another. The majority of women with ectopic pregnancies have had [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] or [[salpingitis]], an inflammation of the fallopian tube.  A history of [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] can also cause tubal problems that increase the risk.
[[Endometriosis]], a condition that causes the tissue that normally lines the uterus to develop outside the uterus may slightly increase the incidence of an ectopic. The risk is increased in women who have unusually shaped fallopian tubes or tubes which has been damaged, possibly during surgery. Taking medication to stimulate ovulation increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Although pregnancy is rare when using birth control pills or an [[intrauterine device]] (IUD), if it does occur, it's more likely to be ectopic.  Although pregnancy is rare after [[tubal ligation]], if it does occur, it's more likely to be ectopic.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ectopic-pregnancy/DS00622/DSECTION=risk-factors Ectopic pregnancy: Risk factors - MayoClinic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A recent [[meta-analysis]] of clinical outcomes has shown that cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of tubal ectopic pregnancy.<ref name=PMC2880914 />

===Concomitant diseases===
{{see also|Anticoagulation in pregnancy}}
In addition to [[complications of pregnancy]] that can arise, a woman may have other diseases or conditions (not directly caused by the pregnancy) that may become worse or be a potential risk to the pregnancy.

*[[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy]] deals with the interactions of [[diabetes mellitus]] (not restricted to [[gestational diabetes]]) and pregnancy. Risks for the child include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, fetal obesity (macrosomia), polyhydramnios and birth defects.
*In the case of concomitant [[systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy]], there is an increased rate of fetal death ''in utero'' and [[spontaneous abortion]] (miscarriage), as well as of [[neonatal lupus]].
*[[Thyroid disease in pregnancy]] can, if uncorrected, cause adverse effects on fetal and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child. Demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy which may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen.
*Pregnant women who contract [[H1N1 influenza]] infection are recommended to receive antiviral therapy with either [[oseltamivir]] (which is the preferred medication) or [[zanamivir]].<ref name=icsi2010>[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition.] By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement.

==Epidemiology==
{{See also|Pregnancy rate|Advanced maternal age}}
In Europe, the average childbearing age has been rising continuously for some time. In Western, Northern, and Southern Europe, first-time mothers are on average 26 to 29 years old, up from 23 to 25 years at the start of the 1970s. In a number of European countries (Spain), the mean age of women at first childbirth has now even crossed the 30-year threshold.

This process is not restricted to Europe. Asia, Japan and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise, and increasingly the process is spreading to countries in the developing world like China, Turkey and Iran. In the U.S., the age of first childbirth was 25 in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|last=T.J.|first=Mathews|coauthors=Brady E.

==Society and culture==
[[File:Venus of Willendorf 03.jpg|thumb|The "[[Venus of Willendorf]]"]]
<!-- This section has no references because it is mostly based on the German Wikipedia article. Most information here is common sense or should be easy to source. The section is intended to kickstart a more in-depth treatment. -->

In most cultures, pregnant women have a special status in society and receive particularly gentle care.<ref name=isbn_9780759110441 /> At the same time, they are subject to expectations that may exert great psychological pressure, such as having to produce a son and heir. In many traditional societies, pregnancy must be preceded by marriage, on pain of ostracism of mother and [[Legitimacy (law)|(illegitimate) child]].

Depictions of pregnant women can serve as mystically connotated symbols of fertility. The so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]] with its exaggerated female sexual characteristics (huge breasts and belly, prominent [[mons pubis]]) has been interpreted as indicative of a [[rite|fertility cult]] in [[paleolithic Europe]].

Overall, pregnancy is accompanied by numerous customs that are often subject to ethnological research, often rooted in [[traditional medicine]] or religion. The [[baby shower]] is an example of a modern custom.

Pregnancy is an important topic in [[sociology of the family]]. The prospective child is preliminarily placed into numerous [[social role]]s such as prospective heir or welfare recipient. (This may accelerate weddings.) The parents' relationship and the relation between parents and their surroundings are also affected.

[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -16- - Visitation.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giotto di Bondone]]<br />[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], circa 1305]]

===Arts===
Due to the important role of the [[Mother of God]] in Christianity, the Western visual arts have a long tradition of depictions of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Timothy Verdon ; captions by Filippo|title=Mary in western art|year=2005|publisher=In Association with Hudson Hills Press|location=New York|isbn=0-9712981-9-X|pages=106|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&pg=PA106&dq=097129819X+pregnancy#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> 

Pregnancy, and especially pregnancy of unmarried women, is also an important motif in literature. Notable examples include Hardy's [[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]] and Goethe's [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|Faust]].

===Infertility===
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
Modern reproductive medicine offers a choice of measures for couples who stay childless against their will: fertility treatment, [[artificial insemination]] and [[surrogacy]].

===Abortion===
{{main|Abortion}}
An abortion is the termination of an embryo or fetus, either naturally or via medical methods. When done electively, it is more often done within the first trimester than the second, and rarely in the third.<ref name=sharply />  Not using contraception, contraceptive failure, poor family planning or rape can lead to [[unintended pregnancy|undesired pregnancies]]. Legality of socially indicated abortions varies widely both internationally and through time. In most countries of Western Europe, abortions during the first trimester were a criminal offense a few decades ago but have since been legalized, sometimes subject to mandatory consultations. In Germany, for example, as of 2009 less than 3% of abortions had a medical indication.

===Legal protection===
Many countries have various legal regulations in place to protect pregnant women and their children. [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000|Maternity Protection Convention]] ensures that pregnant women are exempt from activities such as night shifts or carrying heavy stocks. [[Maternity leave]] typically provides paid leave from work during roughly the last trimester of pregnancy and for some time after birth. Notable extreme cases include Norway (8 months with full pay) and the United States (no paid leave at all except in some states). Moreover, many countries have laws against [[pregnancy discrimination]].
