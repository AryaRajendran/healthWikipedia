The '''Mark I NAAK''', or '''MARK I Kit''', is [[United States military]] nomenclature for the '''"Nerve Agent Antidote Kit"'''. It is a dual-chamber [[autoinjector]]: Two anti-[[nerve agent]] drugs — [[atropine sulfate]] and [[pralidoxime chloride]] — each in injectable form, constitute the kit. The kits are only effective against the nerve agents [[Tabun (nerve agent)|Tabun]] (GA), [[Sarin]] (GB), [[Soman]] (GD) and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]].

Typically, U.S. servicemembers are issued three MARK I Kits when operating in circumstances where chemical weapons are considered a potential hazard. Along with the three kits are issued one [[Diazepam#CANA|CANA]] (Convulsive Antidote, Nerve Agent) for simultaneous use. (CANA is the drug [[diazepam]] or ''Valium'', an anticonvulsant.) Both of these kits are intended for use in "buddy aid" or "self aid" administration of the drugs prior to [[decontamination]] and delivery of the patient to definitive medical care.

A newer model, the [[ATNAA]] (Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-Injector),<ref>[http://www.meridianmeds.com/pdf/ATNAA_Pack_Insert.pdf Meridian Meds - ATNAA Pack Insert]</ref> has both the atropine and the pralidoxime in one syringe, allowing for simplified administration.  

The use of a Mark 1 or ATNAA kit inhibits the nerve agents' purpose, thereby reducing the number of fatal casualties in the advent of chemical warfare. The kits should only be administered if nerve agents have been absorbed or inhaled.
