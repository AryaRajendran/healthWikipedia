In [[medicine]], '''systolic hypertension''' is defined as an elevated [[Blood pressure|systolic blood pressure]] (SBP).

If the systolic blood pressure is elevated (>140) with a normal (<90) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), it is called "isolated systolic hypertension".<ref name="urlIsolated systolic hypertension: A health concern? - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hypertension/AN01113 |title=Isolated systolic hypertension: A health concern? - MayoClinic.com |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref><ref name="urlThe Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Education">{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/nephrology/isosystolic/isosystolic.htm |title=The Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Education |work= |accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

==Causes==
Systolic hypertension may be due to reduced [[compliance (physiology)|compliance physiology]] of the aorta with increasing age.<ref name="pmid10651605">{{cite journal |author=Smulyan H, Safar ME |title=The diastolic blood pressure in systolic hypertension |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=233–7 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10651605 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10651605}}</ref> This increases the load on the ventricle and compromises coronary blood flow, eventually resulting in [[left ventricular hypertrophy]], [[coronary ischemia]], and [[heart failure]].<ref name = "DeLoach">{{Cite journal | last = DeLoach| first = SS| last2 = Townsend| first2 = RR| title = Systolic Hypertension: A Guide to Optimal Therapy| journal = Consultant| volume = 48| issue = 3| date = March 2008| url = http://www.consultantlive.com/hypertension/article/10162/1151005?pageNumber=1 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

Contemporary physics shows an [[immersed boundary method]] of computational illustration of a single [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. Applied to physiologic models, immersed boundary theory sees the heart as a great folded semisolid [[sail]] fielding and retrieving a viscous blood mass. The sail, likened to [[Windkessel effect]] physiology, gives and receives a load under time-ordered phases. Decreasing compliance of the sail heralds the onset of systolic hypertension.

==Treatment==
The goal of treating systolic hypertension is to delay and reduce the extent of damage to the heart, the cerebrovascular system, and the kidneys. Lifestyle interventions are a crucial element of successful treatment, including a diet low in sodium (salt) and rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Clinical trials have also documented the beneficial effects of weight loss, increased physical activity, and limiting alcohol consumption.<ref name="DeLoach"/>

In addition to lifestyle changes, medication can also be used to reduce systolic hypertension to safe levels, although medications frequently have side effects, often serious. Two [[randomized controlled trial]]s have established the value of treating systolic hypertension:

===1<sup>st</sup>: SHEP study===
This [[randomized controlled trial]] showed a reduction of three strokes per 100 patients treated for five years with [[chlorthalidone]].<ref name="pmid2046107">{{cite journal |author= ,|title=Prevention of stroke by antihypertensive drug treatment in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension.

* Patients: inclusion criteria were SBP greater than 160 to 219&nbsp;mm Hg and DBP less than 90&nbsp;mm Hg. The mean initial blood pressure was 170/77.
* Treatment goal: 20 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure or a systolic pressure of less than 160 mmHg, whichever was lower
* Mean final blood pressure in the treatment group: 143/68

===2<sup>nd</sup>: Syst-Eur Trial===
This [[randomized controlled trial]] showed a reduction of 0.3 strokes per 100 patients treated with [[nitrendipine]] for a median follow-up of two years.<ref name="pmid9297994">{{cite journal |author=Staessen JA, Fagard R, Thijs L, ''et al.'' |title=Randomised double-blind comparison of placebo and active treatment for older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

* Patients: inclusion criteria were systolic of 160–219&nbsp;mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure lower than 95&nbsp;mm Hg. The average was 174/86.
* Treatment goal: "We aimed to reduce the sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to less than 150 mm Hg"
* Mean final blood pressure in the treatment group was 151/79; 44% of patients reached the target blood pressure goals.

===The treatment goal===
Based on these studies, treating to a [[systolic blood pressure]] of 140, as long as the [[diastolic blood pressure]] is 68 or more, seems safe. Corroborating this, a reanalysis of the SHEP data suggests allowing the diastolic to go below 70 may increase adverse effects.<ref name="pmid8478043"/>

A [[meta-analysis]] of individual patient data from [[randomized controlled trial]]s found the nadir [[diastolic blood pressure]] below which cardiovascular outcomes increase is 85&nbsp;mm Hg for untreated hypertensives and 80&nbsp;mm Hg for treated hypertensives.<ref name="pmid11900496">{{cite journal |author=Boutitie F, Gueyffier F, Pocock S, Fagard R, Boissel JP |title=J-shaped relationship between blood pressure and mortality in hypertensive patients: new insights from a meta-analysis of individual-patient data |journal=Ann.

* The nadir value of 85&nbsp;mm Hg for treated hypertensives in the meta-analysis is higher than the value of 68–70&nbsp;mm Hg that is the nadir suggested by the two major randomized controlled trials of isolated systolic hypertension

* The independent contributions of diseases and factors other than hypertension versus effects of treatment are not clear in the meta-analysis.

Newer treatments have emerged since these trials, which address the underlying causes of hypertension in novel ways. For instance, a direct inhibitor of the kidney hormone [[renin]], called [[aliskiren]], has recently been released in the United States. It has antihypertensive efficacy similar to [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin receptor blockers]]. By suppressing renin activity directly rather than indirectly (as these other medications do), it avoids a rebound in renin levels that gradually interferes with their efficacy.<ref name = "DeLoach" /> Over the long term, though, it may lead to increases in the physiological precursor of renin. Its role as a single agent without the concomitant use of other antihypertensives is not yet clear.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Vidt| first = DG| title = What's New in the Treatment of Hypertension?| journal = Consultant| volume = 48| issue = 1| date = January 2008| url = http://www.consultantlive.com/hypertension/article/10162/1147256 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

Medications that act on the [[sympathetic nervous system]], which is important in the cause of hypertension, also show promise. European studies show selective imidazoline agonists, such as moxonidine and rilmenidine, are reasonably effective against hypertension while improving glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism.<ref name = "DeLoach" />
