Historically Jeyes Fluid has also been used in medical treatments, as quoted by [[William Robert Woodman|Dr. William Robert Woodman]] in the [[BMJ|British Medical Journal]] (1888, Vol 2):<ref name="Jeyes">{{cite web|url=http://www.clickcleaning.co.uk/cleaning-guides-tips/22/the-history-of-jeyes-fluid-.aspx |title= The History of Jeyes Fluid}}</ref> 

<blockquote>''Dr. Woodman drew special attention to the scarlet fever cases treated in hospital, and pointed out that the whole of the deaths among them occurred in 1877. From 1877 to December 31st 1887, 241 cases of scarlet fever were treated by the medical officers at the sanatorium without a death.''"<ref name="BMJ 1888">{{cite journal|pmc=2197732 |title= The British Medical Journal, 1888 vol 2 | pmid=20752390 | volume=2 |issue=1439 |year=1888 |month=July |journal=Br Med J |pages=173–4}}</ref></blockquote>

Since 1877 Dr. Woodman's patients were given frequent warm baths with some Jeyes' Fluid added. This proved significant in the treatment of [[scarlet fever]] and the prevention of [[dropsy]], which usually followed.

For the first time in its 130 years, Jeyes Fluid appeared on television screens with a £500,000 advertising campaign that was aired in the UK over the Easter bank holiday in 2011. This campaign was to widen the appeal of the brand, remind consumers of its versatility, and introduce the product to a new generation.<ref name="Tribe PR">{{cite web|url=http://tribepr.com/News-views/News/April-2011/Jeyes-Fluid-makes-TV-debut.aspx |title= Jeyes Fluid makes TV debut}}</ref>

The product is pronounced as "Jays" Fluid.
