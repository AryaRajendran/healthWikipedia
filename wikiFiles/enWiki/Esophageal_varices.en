In [[medicine]] ([[gastroenterology]]), '''esophageal varices''' (or '''oesophageal varices''') are extremely [[Vasodilation|dilated]] sub-mucosal [[vein]]s in the lower third <ref>Rubin's Pathology: Clinicopathologic Foundations of Medicine edited by Raphael Rubin, David S. Strayer, Emanuel Rubin, page 612</ref> of the [[esophagus]]. They are most often a consequence of [[portal hypertension]], commonly due to [[cirrhosis]]; patients with esophageal varices have a strong tendency to develop [[bleeding]].

Esophageal varices are diagnosed with [[endoscopy]].<ref name=Biecker_2005>{{cite journal |author=Biecker E, Schepke M, Sauerbruch T |title=The role of endoscopy in portal hypertension |journal=Dig Dis |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=11–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15920321 |doi=10.1159/000084721}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==

The majority of blood from the [[esophagus]] is drained via the [[esophageal veins]], which carry deoxygenated blood from the esophagus to the [[azygos vein]], which in turn drains directly into the [[superior vena cava]].  These veins have no part in the development of esophageal varices.  The remaining blood from the esophagus is drained into the superficial veins lining the esophageal mucosa, which drain into the [[left gastric vein]] ([[coronary vein]]), which in turn drains directly into the [[portal vein]]. These superficial veins (normally only approximately 1mm in diameter) become distended up to 1–2&nbsp;cm in diameter in association with portal hypertension.

Normal portal pressure is approximately 9 mmHg compared to an inferior vena cava pressure of 2-6 mmHg.  This creates a normal pressure gradient of 3-7 mmHg.  If the portal pressure rises above 12 mmHg, this gradient rises to 7-10 mmHg.<ref name=Arguedas_2003>{{cite journal |author=Arguedas M |title=The critically ill liver patient: the variceal bleeder |journal=Semin Gastrointest Dis |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=34–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12610853}}</ref>  A gradient greater than 5 mmHg is considered [[portal hypertension]].  At gradients greater than 10 mmHg, blood flow though the hepatic portal system is redirected from the liver into areas with lower venous pressures.  This means that [[collateral circulation]] develops in the lower [[esophagus]], abdominal wall, [[stomach]], and [[rectum]].  The small blood vessels in these areas become distended, becoming more thin-walled, and appear as [[varicose veins|varicosities]].  In addition, these vessels are poorly supported by other structures, as they are not designed for high pressures.

In situations where portal pressures increase, such as with [[cirrhosis]], there is dilation of veins in the [[anastomosis]], leading to esophageal varices. Splenic vein thrombosis is a rare condition that causes esophageal varices without a raised portal pressure. [[Splenectomy]] can cure the variceal bleeding due to splenic vein thrombosis.

Varices can also form in other areas of the body, including the [[stomach]] ('''[[gastric varices]]'''), [[duodenum]] ('''[[intestinal varices|duodenal varices]]'''), and [[rectum]] ('''[[Rectal_Varices|rectal varices]]''').  Treatment of these types of varices may differ. In some cases, [[schistosomiasis]] also leads to esophageal varices.

==Treatment==
[[Image:esophageal varices - post banding.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Esophageal varices seven days post [[banding (medical)|banding]], showing ulceration at the site of banding.]]
In emergency situations, the care is directed at stopping blood loss, maintaining plasma volume, correcting disorders in coagulation induced by cirrhosis, and appropriate use of [[antibiotics]] (usually a quinolone or ceftriaxone, as infection by gram-negative strains is either concomitant or a precipitant).

Blood volume resuscitation should be done promptly and with caution.  Goal should be hemodynamic stability and hemoglobin of over 8.  Resuscitation of all lost blood  leads to increase in portal pressure leading to more bleeding.  Volume resuscitation can also worsen ascites and increase portal pressure. (AASLD guidelines)

Therapeutic [[endoscopy]] is considered the mainstay of urgent treatment.  Two main therapeutic approaches exist:

# Variceal ligation, or [[banding (medical)|banding]].
# [[Sclerotherapy]].

In cases of refractory bleeding, [[balloon tamponade]] with Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may be necessary, usually as a bridge to further [[endoscopy]] or treatment of the underlying cause of bleeding (usually portal hypertension).  Methods of treating the portal hypertension include: [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] (TIPS), or a [[distal splenorenal shunt procedure]] or a [[liver transplantation]].

Nutritional supplementation is not necessary if the patient is not eating for four days or less.<ref name="pmid9073135">{{cite journal |author=de Lédinghen V, Beau P, Mannant PR, ''et al.'' |title=Early feeding or enteral nutrition in patients with cirrhosis after bleeding from esophageal varices?

[[Terlipressin]] and [[octreotide]] (50mcg bolus IV followed by 25-50mcg/h IVF for 1 to 5 days) have also been used.<ref name="pmid19223890">{{cite journal |author=Abid S, Jafri W, Hamid S, ''et al.'' |title=Terlipressin vs. octreotide in bleeding esophageal varices as an adjuvant therapy with endoscopic band ligation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial |journal=Am.

==Prevention==
In ideal circumstances, patients with known varices should receive treatment to reduce their risk of bleeding.<ref name=Lebrec_1981>{{cite journal | doi=10.1056/NEJM198112033052302 | author=Lebrec D, Poynard T, Hillon P, Benhamou J-P | title=Propranolol for prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a controlled study | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1981 | volume=305 | issue= 23| pages=1371&ndash;1374 | url=  | pmid=7029276}}</ref> The non-selective [[beta-blocker|β-blocker]]s (e.g., [[propranolol]] 10&nbsp;mg PO TID, [[timolol]] or [[nadolol]] 20&nbsp;mg PO OD) and nitrates (e.g. [[isosorbide mononitrate]] (IMN) 20&nbsp;mg BD to TID) have been evaluated for secondary prophylaxis.  Non-selective [[beta-blocker|β-blocker]]s (but not cardioselective [[beta-blocker|β-blocker]]s like [[atenolol]]) are preferred because they decrease both cardiac output by β<sub>1</sub> blockade and splanchnic blood flow by blocking vasodilating β<sub>2</sub> receptors at splanchnic vasculature. The effectiveness of this treatment has been shown by a number of different studies.<ref name=Talwalkar_2004>{{cite journal | author=Talwalkar JA, Kamath PS | title=An evidence-based medicine approach to beta-blocker therapy in patients with cirrhosis | journal=Am J Med | year=2004 | volume=116 | issue= 11| pages=759&ndash;766 | url=  | pmid=15144913 | doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.03.006}}</ref>

However, non-selective [[beta-blocker|β-blocker]]s do not prevent the ''formation'' of esophageal varices.<ref name="Groszmann _2005">{{cite journal | author=Groszmann RJ, Garcia-Tsao G, Bosch J, ''et al.''  | title=Beta-Blockers to Prevent Gastroesophageal Varices in Patients with Cirrhosis | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2005 | volume=353 | issue=21 | pages=2254&ndash;2261 | url=  | pmid=16306522 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa044456}}</ref>

==Histology==
[[File:Oesophagusvarizen 02.jpg|thumb|right|Axial CT showing esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension]]
Dilated submucosal veins are the most prominent histologic feature of esophageal varices.  The expansion of the submucosa leads to elevation of the mucosa above the surrounding tissue, which is apparent during endoscopy and is a key diagnostic feature. Evidence of recent variceal hemorrhage includes [[necrosis]] and [[Peptic ulcer|ulceration]] of the mucosa. Evidence of past variceal hemorrhage includes inflammation and [[venous thrombosis]].
