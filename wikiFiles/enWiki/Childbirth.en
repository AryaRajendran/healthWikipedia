'''Childbirth''', '''labour''', '''delivery''', '''birth''', '''partus''', or '''parturition''' is the culmination of a [[pregnancy]] period with the expulsion of one or more newborn [[infant]]s from a [[woman]]'s [[uterus]]. The process of normal childbirth is categorized in three stages of labour: the shortening and [[Cervical dilation|dilation]] of the [[cervix]], descent and birth of the [[infant]], and birth of the [[placenta]].<ref>The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Copyright 2006 Columbia University Press.</ref>  

In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through [[induction of labor]] or [[caesarean section]], which is the removal of the [[neonate]] through a [[surgery|surgical]] incision in the [[abdomen]], rather than through [[vagina]]l birth.<ref>[http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/cesarean-section-trends.pdf ChildbirthConnection.org] 50% increase in US Caesarean section from 1996-2006</ref> Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006, and comprise nearly 32% of births in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name="urlsslforms.fairview.org" /><ref name="childbirthconnection">[http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/cesarean-section-trends.pdf ChildbirthConnection.org]</ref>  With respect to induced labor, more than 22% of women  undergo [[induction of labour]] in the United States.<ref name="urlsslforms.fairview.org">{{cite web |url=https://sslforms.fairview.org/static/ACOG%202009%20Induction%20of%20Labor_1_latest_c_754578.pdf |title=Induction of Labor |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> Medical professional policy makers find that induced births and elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother, and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.patientsafetycouncil.org/uploads/MOD_39_Weeks_Toolkit.pdf |title=Elimination of Non-medically Indicated (Elective) Deliveries Before 39 Weeks Gestational Age |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

[[Pain]] levels reported by labouring women vary widely. They appear to be influenced by fear and anxiety levels, experience with prior childbirth, cultural ideas of childbirth and pain,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=8627405|title=Cultural Aspects of Pain in Childbearing Women|year=1996|last1=Weber|first1=SE|volume=25|issue=1|pages=67–72|journal=Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN / NAACOG|doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.1996.tb02515.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The pain of childbirth: perceptions of culturally diverse women |pmid=14663792|year=2003|last1=Callister|first1=LC|last2=Khalaf|first2=I|last3=Semenic|first3=S|last4=Kartchner|first4=R|last5=Vehvilainen-Julkunen|first5=K|volume=4|issue=4|pages=145–54|journal=Pain management nursing : official journal of the American Society of Pain Management Nurses|doi=10.1016/S1524-9042(03)00028-6}}</ref> mobility during labour and the support given during labour. One small study found that middle-eastern women, especially those with a low educational background, had more painful experiences during childbirth.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cultural and educational influences on pain of childbirth|pmid=2703733|year=1989|last1=Weisenberg|first1=M|last2=Caspi|first2=Z|volume=4|issue=1|pages=13–9|journal=Journal of pain and symptom management|doi=10.1016/0885-3924(89)90059-6}}</ref>

Pain is only one factor of many influencing women's experience with the process of childbirth. A systematic review of 137 studies found that personal expectations, the amount of support from caregivers, quality of the caregiver-patient relationship, and involvement in decisionmaking are more important in women's overall satisfaction with the experience of childbirth than are other factors such as age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, preparation, physical environment, pain, immobility, or medical interventions.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pain and women's satisfaction with the experience of childbirth: A systematic review|pmid=12011880|year=2002|last1=Hodnett|first1=ED|volume=186|issue=5 Suppl Nature|pages=S160–72|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology}}</ref>

===Descriptions===
Pain in contractions has been described as feeling like a very strong menstrual cramp. Midwives often encourage refraining from screaming but recommend moaning and grunting to relieve some pain. Crowning will feel like intense stretching and burning. Even women who show little reaction to labour pains often show a reaction to crowning.<ref>[http://americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/crowning.html  "Crowning"] American Pregnancy Association.</ref>

===Psychological===
Childbirth can be an intense event and strong emotions, both positive and negative, can be brought to the surface.  Abnormal and persistent fear of childbirth is known as [[tokophobia]].

During the later stages of gestation there is an increase in abundance of [[oxytocin]], a hormone that is known to evoke feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness and security around the mate.<ref name="Meyer2007">{{Cite journal|first=Dixie |last=Meyer |year=2007 |title=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Their Effects on Relationship Satisfaction |journal=The Family Journal |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=392–397 |doi=10.1177/1066480707305470}}</ref> 
Oxytocin is further released during labor when the fetus stimulates the cervix and vagina, and it is believed that it plays a major role in the bonding of a mother to her infant and in the establishment of maternal behavior. The act of nursing a child also  causes a release of oxytocin.<ref>http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/hypopit/oxytocin.html</ref>

Between 70% and 80% of mothers in the United States report some feelings of sadness or "baby blues" after childbirth.  The symptoms normally occur for a few minutes up to few hours each day and they should lessen and disappear within two weeks after delivery.<ref>[http://americanpregnancy.org/firstyearoflife/babyblues.htm Baby Blues - American Pregnancy Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>[[Postpartum depression]] may develop in some women; about 10% of mothers in the United States are diagnosed with this condition.

== Normal human birth ==

=== Vaginal birth ===
Because humans are bipedal with an erect stance and have, in relation to the size of the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], the biggest head of any mammalian species, human fetuses and human female pelvises are adapted to make birth possible.

The erect posture causes the weight of the abdominal contents to thrust on the [[pelvic floor]], a complex structure which must not only support this weight but allow three channels to pass through it: the [[urethra]], the [[vagina]] and the [[rectum]]. The infant's head and shoulders must go through a specific sequence of maneuvers in order to pass through the ring of the mother's pelvis.

Six phases of a typical vertex (head-first presentation) delivery:
# '''Engagement''' of the fetal head in the transverse position. The baby's head is facing across the pelvis at one or other of the mother's hips.
# '''Descent and [[flexion]]''' of the fetal head.
# '''Internal rotation'''. The fetal head rotates 90 degrees to the [[Position (obstetrics)|occipito-anterior position]] so that the baby's face is towards the mother's rectum.
# '''Delivery by extension'''. The fetal head passes out of the birth canal. Its head is tilted forwards so that the crown of its head leads the way through the vagina.
# '''Restitution'''. The fetal head turns through 45 degrees to restore its normal relationship with the shoulders, which are still at an angle.
# '''External rotation'''. The shoulders repeat the corkscrew movements of the head, which can be seen in the final movements of the fetal head.

'''Station''' refers to the relationship of the fetal presenting part to the level of the ischial spines. When the presenting part is at the ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement). If the presenting fetal part is above the spines, the distance is measured and described as minus stations, which range from -1 to -4&nbsp;cm. If the presenting part is below the ischial spines, the distance is stated as plus stations ( +1 to +4&nbsp;cm). At +3 and +4 the presenting part is at the perineum and can be seen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pillitteri, Adele |title=Maternal and Child Health Nursing: Care of the Childbearing and Childrearing Family |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=1-58255-999-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref>

The fetal head may temporarily change shape substantially (becoming more elongated) as it moves through the birth canal. This change in the shape of the fetal head is called ''[[molding]]'' and is much more prominent in women having their first vaginal delivery.<ref name=Healthline>[http://www.healthline.com/yodocontent/pregnancy/assisted-delivery-types-forceps.html Healthline > Types of Forceps Used in Delivery] February 2006.

{{anchor|stages}}

===Latent phase===
The latent phase of labour is also called [[prodromal labour]] or pre-labour. Sometimes, it is classified as preceding stage 1, and sometimes it is classified as being the "latent phase of stage 1", and in such classification the succeeding phase can be termed the "active phase of stage 1".<ref name=usatine>[http://familymed.uthscsa.edu/residency/maternityguide/labor&delivery.htm LABOR & DELIVERY] at MATERNITY GUIDE at [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]] Family & Community Medicine Dept.

Contributions by Kourosh Jahangir, MD. Retrieved July 2012</ref>

The latent phase is generally defined as beginning at the point at which the woman perceives regular [[uterine contraction]]s.<ref>[http://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor Latent phase of labor] in [[UpToDate]]. Author: Andrew J Satin. Section Editor: Charles J Lockwood. Deputy Editor: Vanessa A Barss. This topic last updated: May, 2012.</ref> In contrast, [[Braxton Hicks contractions]], which are contractions that may start around 26 weeks gestation and are sometimes called "false labour", should be infrequent, irregular, and involve only mild cramping.<ref name=Hen2005>{{cite book|author=Leah Hennen; Murray, Linda; Jim Scott|title=The BabyCenter Essential Guide to Pregnancy and Birth : Expert Advice and Real-World Wisdom from the Top Pregnancy and Parenting Resource|publisher=Rodale Books|location=Emmaus, Pa|year=2005|isbn=1-59486-211-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AK60Xmnrm_AC&pg=PA294&dq=%22Braxton+Hicks+contractions%22#PPA295,M1|accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Cervical effacement]],  which is the thinning and stretching of the [[cervix]], and [[cervical dilation]] occur during the closing weeks of [[pregnancy]] and is usually complete or near complete, by the end of the latent phase. The degree of cervical effacement may be felt during a vaginal examination but is not necessary. A 'long' cervix implies that not much has been taken into the lower segment, and vice versa for a 'short' cervix. Latent phase ends with the onset of active first stage, and this transition is generally defined as a cervix dilation of either 3&nbsp;cm<ref name=usatine/> or 4&nbsp;cm.

===First stage: dilation===
The first stage of labour (or "active phase of first stage" if previous phase is termed "latent phase of first stage")<ref name=usatine/> is generally defined as starting when the effaced (thinned) cervix is 3&nbsp;cm<ref name=usatine/> or 4&nbsp;cm dilated. Women may or may not have active [[contraction (childbirth)|contractions]] before reaching this point. [[Rupture of the membranes]] or a [[bloody show]] may or may not occur at or around this stage.

There are several factors that midwives and physicians use to assess the labouring mother's progress, and these are defined by the [[bishop score|Bishop Score]]. The Bishop score is also used as a means to predict whether the mother is likely to spontaneously progress into second stage (delivery).

Uterine muscles form opposing spirals from the top of the upper segment of the uterus to its junction with the lower segment. During effacement, the cervix becomes incorporated into the lower segment of the uterus. During a contraction, these muscles contract causing shortening of the upper segment and drawing upwards of the lower segment, in a gradual expulsive motion. The presenting fetal part then is permitted to descend. Full dilation is reached when the cervix has widened enough to allow passage of the baby's head, around 10&nbsp;cm dilation for a term baby.

The duration of labour varies widely, but active phase averages some 8 hours<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/labourandbirth/labourcomplications/speedinguplabour/|title=lSpeeding up labour|accessdate=January 2009}}</ref> for women giving birth to their first child ("primiparae") and shorter for women who have already given birth ("multiparae"). Active phase arrest is defined as in a primigravid woman as the failure of the cervix to dilate at a rate of 1.2&nbsp;cm/hr over a period of at least two hours. This definition is based on Friedman's Curve, which plots the typical rate of cervical dilation and fetal descent during active labour.<ref name="The Friedman Curve: An Obsolete Approach to Labor Assessment">{{cite journal |doi=10.1067/mob.2002.127142 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/450311 |title=Reassessing the labor curve in nulliparous women |year=2002 |last1=Zhang |first1=Jun |last2=Troendle |first2=James F. |last3=Yancey |first3=Michael K. |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=187 |issue=4 |pages=824–8 |pmid=12388957}}</ref> Some practitioners may diagnose "Failure to Progress", and consequently, perform a Cesarean.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3748488 |year=1986 |last1=Peisner |first1=DB |last2=Rosen |first2=MG |title=Transition from latent to active labor |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=448–51 |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology}}</ref>
[[File:Cervix dilation sequence.svg|thumb|center|700px|Sequence of cervix dilation during labour]]
{{-}}

===Second stage: fetal expulsion===
This stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated, and ends when the baby is born. As pressure on the cervix increases, the [[Ferguson reflex]] increases uterine contractions so that the second stage can go ahead{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. At the beginning of the normal second stage, the head is fully engaged in the pelvis; the widest diameter of the head has passed below the level of the [[pelvic inlet]]. The fetal head then continues descent into the pelvis, below the pubic arch and out through the vaginal [[introitus]] (opening). This is assisted by the additional maternal efforts of "bearing down" or pushing. The appearance of the fetal head at the vaginal orifice is termed the "crowning".  At this point, the woman may feel a burning or stinging sensation.

Complete expulsion of the baby signals the successful completion of the second stage of labour.

[[File:Umbilical-newborn.jpg|thumb|A newborn baby with [[umbilical cord]] ready to be clamped]]

The second stage of birth will vary by factors including [[Parity (biology)|parity]], fetal size, anesthesia, the presence of infection. Longer labours are associated with declining rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery and increasing rates of infection, perineal laceration, obstetric hemorrhage, as well as need for intensive care of the neonate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2009.08.003 |title=Second-stage labour duration in nulliparous women: Relationship to maternal and perinatal outcomes |year=2009 |last1=Rouse |first1=Dwight J. |last2=Weiner |first2=Steven J. |last3=Bloom |first3=Steven L. |last4=Varner |first4=Michael W. |last5=Spong |first5=Catherine Y. |last6=Ramin |first6=Susan M. |last7=Caritis |first7=Steve N. |last8=Peaceman |first8=Alan M. |last9=Sorokin |first9=Yoram |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=201 |issue=4 |pages=357.e1}}</ref>

===Third stage: delivery of the placenta===
{{Further|Umbilical cord|Placental expulsion}}
[[File:Thirdstage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Breastfeeding]] during and after the third stage, the placenta is visible in the bowl to the right.]]
The period from just after the fetus is expelled until just after the placenta is expelled is called the ''third stage of labour''.

The [[umbilical cord]] is routinely clamped and cut in this stage.  General hospital-based [[obstetrics|obstetric]] practice introduces artificial clamping as early as 1 minute after the birth of the child.  In [[birthing center]]s, this may be delayed by 5 minutes or more, or omitted entirely. Clamping is followed by cutting of the cord, which is painless due to the absence of [[nerve]]s.  

[[Placental expulsion]] begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus. The period from just after the fetus is expelled until just after the placenta is expelled is called the ''third stage of labour''. The average time from delivery of the baby until complete expulsion of the placenta is estimated to be 10–12 minutes dependent on whether active or expectant management is employed<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02800.x |title=A comparison of active management and expectant management of the third stage of labour: A Swedish randomised controlled trial |year=2011 |last1=Jangsten |first1=E |last2=Mattsson |first2=L-Å |last3=Lyckestam |first3=I |last4=Hellström |first4=A-L |last5=Berg |first5=M |journal=BJOG: an International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology |volume=118 |issue=3 |page=362}}</ref>  In as many as 3% of all vaginal deliveries, the duration of the third stage is longer than 30 minutes and raises concern for [[retained placenta]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2008.07.005 |title=The retained placenta |year=2008 |last1=Weeks |first1=Andrew D. |journal=Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology |volume=22 |issue=6 |page=1103}}</ref>

Placental expulsion can be managed actively or it can be managed expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance.  Active management is described as the administration of a [[uterotonic]] drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and [[fundal]] massage after delivery of the placenta, and performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours afterward.<ref>[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3510509.html Active Management of the Third State of Labor Is Rare in Some Developing Countries<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In a joint statement, [[World Health Organization]], the International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians and the International Confederations of Midwives recommend active management of the third stage of labour in all vaginal deliveries to help to prevent postpartum [[hemorrhage]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/3/08-052597/en/index.html WHO | Use of active management of the third stage of labour in seven developing countries<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14710151 |year=2004 |author1=International Confederation of Midwives |author2=International Federation of Gynaecologists Obstetricians |title=Joint statement: Management of the third stage of labour to prevent post-partum haemorrhage |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=76–7 |doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2003.11.005 |journal=Journal of midwifery & women's health}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=WHO|title=Recommendations for the Prevention of Postpartum Haemorrhage Department of Making Pregnancy Safer|journal=Geneva: WHO|year=2007|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2007/WHO_MPS_07.06_eng.pdf}}</ref> 

When the [[amniotic sac]] has not ruptured during labour or pushing, the infant can be born with the membranes intact. This is referred to as "delivery en [[caul]]." The caul is harmless and its membranes are easily broken and wiped away. With the advent of modern obstetrics, artificial rupture of the membranes has become common, so babies are rarely born in the caul.

===Fourth stage===
The "fourth stage of labour" is the period beginning immediately after the birth of a child and extending for about six weeks. Another term would be [[postpartum]] period, as it refers to the mother (whereas postnatal refers to the infant). Less frequently used is puerperium.<ref name="pmid2001778">{{cite journal |pmid=2001778 |year=1991 |last1=Gjerdingen |first1=DK |last2=Froberg |first2=DG |title=The fourth stage of labor: The health of birth mothers and adoptive mothers at six-weeks postpartum |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=29–35 |journal=Family medicine}}</ref>

===Afterwards===
{{Further|Postnatal}}
Many cultures feature [[initiation rite]]s for newborns, such as [[circumcision]], naming ceremonies, [[baptism]], and others.

Mothers are often allowed a period where they are relieved of their normal duties to recover from childbirth. The length of this period varies. In many countries, taking time off from work to care for a newborn is called "maternity leave" or "[[parental leave]]" and can vary from a few days to several months.

==Management==
Eating or drinking during labour is an area of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0884217505276155 |title=The Effect of Unrestricted Oral Carbohydrate Intake on Labor Progress |year=2005 |last1=Tranmer |first1=J. E. |journal=Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing |volume=34 |issue=3 |page=319}}</ref> others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) in the event of an emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12698834 |year=2003 |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=G |last2=Scrutton |first2=M |title=NPO during labor.

===Labour induction and elective cesarean===
More than 22% of women undergo [[labour induction]] the United States, and more than doubled the rate from 1990 to 2006.<ref name="urlsslforms.fairview.org" /><ref name="cdc">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf |title=CDD.gov |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>  Induced labour is indicated when either the fetus or woman will benefit compared to continuation of pregnancy, but procedures are often elective.  Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006, and comprise nearly 32% of births in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name="urlsslforms.fairview.org" /><ref name="childbirthconnection" />  Non-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation "carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother."  Hospitals should institute strict monitoring of births to comply with full term (more than 39 weeks gestation) elective induction and C-section guidelines.  In review, three hospitals following policy guidelines brought elective early deliveries down 64%, 57%, and 80%.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org" />  The researchers found many benefits but “no adverse effects” in the health of the mothers and babies at those hospitals.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org" /><ref name="urlTerm Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology">{{cite web |url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2011/06000/Term_Pregnancy__A_Period_of_Heterogeneous_Risk_for.5.aspx |title=Term Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>

Health conditions that may warrant induced labour or C-sections include gestational or chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, diabetes, premature rupture of membranes, severe fetal growth restriction, and post-term pregnancy. Cesarean section too may be of benefit to both the mother and baby for certain indications including maternal HIV/AIDS, Foetal abnormality, breech position, foetal distress, multiple gestations, and maternal medical conditions which would be worsened by labour or vaginal birth.

Oxytocin is the most commonly used agent for induction in the United States, and is used to induce uterine contractions. Other methods of inducing labour include stripping of the amniotic membrane, artificial rupturing of the amniotic sac (called [[amniotomy]]), or stimulation of the [[nipples]] of one breast.  Ripening of the cervix can be accomplished with the placement of a [[Foley catheter]] or the use of synthetic [[prostaglandin]]s such as [[misoprostol]].<ref name="urlsslforms.fairview.org" /> A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mozurkewich|first=EL|coauthors=Chilimigras JL, Breman Dr, Perni UC, Romero VC, King VJ, Keeton KL|title=Methods of induction of labor: a systematic review|journal=BMC Pregnancy Childbirth|year=2011|month=Oct|volume=11|pmid=22032440|doi=10.1186/1471-2393-11-84|pages=84|pmc=3224350}}</ref>

The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) guidelines recommend a full evaluation of the maternal-fetal status, the status of the cervix, and at least a 39 completed weeks (full term) of gestation for optimal health of the newborn when considering elective induction of labour.  Per these guidelines, the following conditions may be an indication for induction, including:

* [[Abruptio placentae]]
* [[Chorioamnionitis]]
* Fetal demise
* [[Gestational hypertension]]
* [[Preeclampsia]] or [[eclampsia]]
* [[Premature rupture of membranes]]
* Postterm pregnancy
* Maternal conditions such as [[gestational diabetes]] or [[chronic kidney disease]]
* Fetal compromise such as isoimmunization leading to [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]] or [[oligohydramnios]]

Induction is also considered for logistical reasons, such as the distance from hospital or psychosocial conditions, but in these instances gestational age confirmation must be done, and the maturity of the fetal lung must be confirmed by testing.  

The ACOG also note that contraindications for induced labour are the same as for spontaneous vaginal delivery, including [[vasa previa]], complete [[placenta praevia]], [[umbilical cord prolapse]] or active [[genital herpes simplex]] infection.<ref name="urlwww.acog.org">{{cite web |url=https://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/ACOG_Districts/District_II/~/media/Districts/District%20II/PDFs/OxytocinForInduction.pdf |title=Optimizing Protocols in Obstetrics OXYTOCIN FOR INDUCTION |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>

===Pain control===
;Non pharmaceutical
Some women prefer to avoid [[analgesic]] medication during childbirth. They can still try to alleviate labour pain using psychological preparation, education, massage, acupuncture, TENS unit use, hypnosis, or water therapy in a tub or shower. Some women like to have someone to support them during labour and birth, such as the [[father]] of the baby, a family member, a close friend, a partner, or a [[doula]].
The human body also has a chemical response to pain, by releasing [[endorphin]]s. Endorphins are present before, during, and immediately after childbirth.<ref name="brinsmead">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1479-828X.1985.tb00642.x |title=Peripartum Concentrations of Beta Endorphin and Cortisol and Maternal Mood States |year=1985 |last1=Brinsmead |first1=M. |last2=Smith |first2=R. |last3=Singh |first3=B. |last4=Lewin |first4=T. |last5=Owens |first5=P. |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology |volume=25 |issue=3 |page=194}}</ref> Some [[homebirth]] advocates believe that this hormone can induce feelings of pleasure and euphoria during childbirth,<ref name="buckley">[http://www.kindredcommunity.com/articles/giving-birth-the-endocrinology-of-ecstacy/p/950 Kindredmedia.com.au], Giving Birth: The Endocrinology of {{sic|Ecs|tasy}}</ref> reducing the risk of [[Postpartum depression|maternal depression]] some weeks later.<ref name="brinsmead" />

[[Water birth]] is an option chosen by some women for pain relief during labour and childbirth, and some studies have shown waterbirth in an uncomplicated pregnancy to reduce the need for analgesia, without evidence of increased risk to mother or newborn.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01443610400023080 |title=Experience of pain and analgesia with water and land births |year=2005 |last1=Eberhard |first1=Jakob |last2=Stein |first2=Sonja |last3=Geissbuehler |first3=Verena |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=127}}</ref> Hot water tubs are available in many hospitals and birthing centres.

[[Meditation]] and mind medicine techniques are also used for pain control during labour and delivery. These techniques are used in conjunction with progressive muscle relaxation and many other forms of relaxation for the mind and body to aid in pain control for women during childbirth. One such technique is the use of [[hypnosis in childbirth]]. There are a number of organizations that teach women and their partners to use a variety of techniques to assist with labour comfort, without the use of pharmaceuticals.

A new mode of analgesia is sterile water injection placed just underneath the skin in the most painful spots during labour. A control trial in Iran of 0.5mL injections was conducted with normal saline which revealed a statistical superiority with water over saline.<ref name="Shohreh Bahasadri">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1479-828X.2006.00536.x |title=Subcutaneous sterile water injection for labour pain: A randomised controlled trial |year=2006 |last1=Bahasadri |first1=Shohreh |last2=Ahmadi-Abhari |first2=Sara |last3=Dehghani-Nik |first3=Mojghan |last4=Habibi |first4=Gholam Reza |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology |volume=46 |issue=2 |page=102}}</ref>

;Pharmaceutical
Different measures for pain control have varying degrees of success and side effects to the woman and her baby. In some countries of [[Europe]], doctors commonly prescribe inhaled [[nitrous oxide]] gas for pain control, especially as 50% nitrous oxide, 50% oxygen, known as [[Entonox]]; in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], midwives may use this gas without a doctor's prescription. [[Pethidine]] (with or without [[promethazine]]) may be used early in labour, as well as other [[opioid]]s such as [[fentanyl]], but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant.

Popular medical pain control in hospitals include the regional anesthetics [[epidural block]]s, and [[spinal anaesthesia]]. Epidural analgesia is a generally safe and effective method of relieving pain in labour, but is associated with longer labour, more operative intervention (particularly instrument delivery), and increases in cost.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1996.tb00833.x |quote=Epidural analgesia is a safe and effective method of relieving pain in labour, but is associated with longer labour, more operative intervention, and increases in cost. It must remain an option; however, caregivers and consumers should be aware of associated risks. Women should be counseled about these risks and other pain-relieving options before the duress of labour. |title=Epidural Analgesia in Labor: An Evaluation of Risks and Benefits |year=1996 |last1=Thorp |first1=James A. |last2=Breedlove |first2=Ginger |journal=Birth |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=63–83 |pmid=8826170}}</ref> Generally, pain and cortisol increased throughout labour in women without EDA.

===Augmentation===
Augmentation is the process of facilitating further labour. [[Oxytocin]] has been used to increase the rate of vaginal delivery in those with a slow progress of labour.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181b11cb8 |title=The Effect of Early Oxytocin Augmentation in Labor |year=2009 |last1=Wei |first1=Shu-Qin |last2=Luo |first2=Zhong-Cheng |last3=Xu |first3=Hairong |last4=Fraser |first4=William D. |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=114 |issue=3 |page=641}}</ref>

===Instrumental delivery===
[[Obstetric forceps]] or [[ventouse]] may be used to facilitate childbirth.

===Multiple births===
In cases of a cephalic presenting twin (first baby head down), twins can often be delivered vaginally. In some cases twin delivery is done in a larger delivery room or in an operating theatre, in the event of complication e.g.
* Both twins born vaginally - this can occur both presented head first or where one comes head first and the other is breech and/or helped by a forceps/ventouse delivery
* One twin born vaginally and the other by caesarean section.
* If the twins are joined at any part of the body - called [[conjoined twins]], delivery is mostly by caesarean section.

[[File:Baby warming tray.jpg|thumb|Baby on warming tray attended to by her [[father]].]]
There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.<ref>[http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/birth/men-at-birth BellyBelly.com.au], Men at Birth - Should your bloke be there?</ref> Research also shows that when a labouring woman was supported by a female helper such as a family member or [[doula]] during labour, she had less need for chemical pain relief, the likelihood of caesarean section was reduced, use of forceps and other instrumental deliveries were reduced, there was a reduction in the length of labour, and the baby had a higher [[Apgar score]] (Dellman 2004, Vernon 2006). However, little research has been conducted to date about the conflicts between partners, professionals, and the mother.

===Monitoring===

====For the Fetus====

=====External Monitoring=====
For [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of the fetus during childbirth, a simple [[Pinard horn|pinard stethoscope]] or [[doppler fetal monitor]] ("''[[doptone]]''") can be used.
A method of external foetal [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] (EFM) during childbirth is [[cardiotocography]], using a ''cardiotocograph'' that consists of two sensors: The ''heart'' (cardio) sensor is an [[ultrasonic sensor]], similar to a [[Doppler fetal monitor]], that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive ''contraction'' transducer, called a ''tocodynamometer'' (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten a section of the wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.<ref>[http://home.btconnect.com/MalcolmBrown/entries/TOCODYNAMOMETER.html Tocodynamometer]. By Dr. Malcolm C Brown. Copyright 2000</ref>
Monitoring with a cardiotocograph can either be intermittent or continuous.

=====Invasive Monitoring=====
A mother's waters have to break before invasive monitoring can be used. More invasive monitoring can involve a [[foetal scalp electrode]] to give an additional measure of fetal heart activity, and/or [[intrauterine pressure catheter]] (IUPC). It can also involve [[foetal scalp pH]] testing.

====For the Mother====
Sometimes a mother may need monitoring during childbirth, parameters such as [[pulse]], [[blood pressure]], [[reflexes]] and the percentage of oxygen in the blood ([[pulse oximetry]]) can be measured. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Collecting stem cells==
It is possible to collect two types of [[stem cells]] during childbirth: [[amniotic stem cells]] or umbilical cord blood stem cells.
To collect [[amniotic stem cells]], it is necessary to do [[amniocentesis]] before or during the birth. Amniotic stem cells are multipotent and very active, useful for both autologous or donor use. There are private banks in US; the first is [[Biocell Center]] in Boston.<ref name="urlEuropean Biotech Company Biocell Center Opens First U.S. Facility for Preservation of Amniotic Stem Cells in Medford, Massachusetts | Reuters">{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS166682+22-Oct-2009+PRN20091022 |title=European Biotech Company Biocell Center Opens First U.S. Facility for Preservation of Amniotic Stem Cells in Medford, Massachusetts &#124; Reuters |work= |accessdate=2010-01-11 | date=2009-10-22}}</ref><ref name="urlEuropes Biocell Center opens Medford office - Daily Business Update - The Boston Globe">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2009/10/europes_biocell.html |title=Europe's Biocell Center opens Medford office - Daily Business Update - The Boston Globe |work= |accessdate=2010-01-11 | date=2009-10-22}}</ref><ref name="urlThe Ticker - BostonHerald.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/general/view/20091022the_ticker |title=The Ticker - BostonHerald.com |work= |accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref>

Umbilical cord blood stem cells are also active, but less multipotent than amniotic stem cells. There are a lot of banks of cord blood, both private and public and for autologous or eterologous use.

Childbirth is an inherently dangerous and risky activity, subject to many complications. The "natural" mortality rate of childbirth—where nothing is done to avert maternal death—has been estimated at 1500 deaths per 100,000 births.<ref name="vanlerberghe">Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. ''Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history’s lessons on reducing maternal mortality.'' In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. ''Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence''. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33). "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, “natural” mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000."</ref> (See main article: [[neonatal death]], [[maternal death]]). Modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth. In modern Western countries, such as the [[United States]] and [[Sweden]], the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.<ref name="vanlerberghe" />{{rp|p.10}} As of June 2011, about one third of American births have some complications, "many of which are directly related to the mother's health."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH%202011HealthyBabiesBrief.pdf|title=Healthy Women, Healthy Babies: How Health Reform Can Improve the Health of Women and Babies in America|publisher=Trust for America's Health|date=June 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2012|author=Jeffrey Levi, David Kohn, and Kay Johnson}}, citing U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Why is Preconception Care a Public Health Concern?''

Birthing complications may be maternal or fetal, and long term or short term.

===Pre-term===
Newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be 2.5 times the number at 40 weeks, and was elevated compared to 38 weeks of gestation. These “early term” births were also associated with increased death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks ("full term").<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org" />  Researchers found benefits to going full term and “no adverse effects” in the health of the mothers or babies.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org" />

Medical researchers find that neonates born before 39 weeks experienced significantly more complications (2.5 times more in one study) compared with those delivered at 39 to 40 weeks. Health problems among babies delivered "pre-term" included respiratory distress, jaundice and low blood sugar.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org" /><ref name="urlNeonatal Outcomes After Demonstrated Fetal Lung Maturity Bef... : Obstetrics & Gynecology">{{cite web |url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2010/12000/Neonatal_Outcomes_After_Demonstrated_Fetal_Lung.9.aspx |title=Neonatal Outcomes After Demonstrated Fetal Lung Maturity Bef... : Obstetrics & Gynecology |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and medical policy makers review research studies and find increased incidence of suspected or proven sepsis, RDS, Hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization > 4 – 5 days.  In the case of cesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labour at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8.2 times higher for pre-labour cesarean at 38 weeks. In this review, no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated (elective) delivery before 39 weeks.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org" />

===Labour complications===
The second stage of labour may be delayed or lengthy due to:
* malpresentation ([[breech birth]] (i.e. buttocks or feet first), face, brow, or other)
* failure of descent of the fetal head through the pelvic brim or the interspinous diameter
* poor uterine contraction strength
* active phase arrest
* [[pelvimetry|cephalo-pelvic disproportion]] (CPD)
* [[shoulder dystocia]]
Secondary changes may be observed: swelling of the tissues, maternal exhaustion, fetal heart rate abnormalities. Left untreated, severe complications include death of mother and/or baby, and genitovaginal [[fistula]].

===Dystocia (obstructed labour)===
<!-- To edit this section, please see the main page [[Dystocia]] -->
{{Main|Dystocia}}
{{:Dystocia}}

===Maternal complications===
'''Vaginal birth injury''' with [[Perineal tear classification|visible tears]] or [[Episiotomy|episiotomies]] are common. Internal tissue tearing as well as nerve damage to the pelvic structures lead in a proportion of women to problems with prolapse, incontinence of stool or urine and sexual dysfunction. Fifteen percent of women become incontinent, to some degree, of stool or urine after normal delivery, this number rising considerably after these women reach menopause. Vaginal birth injury is a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of all non hysterectomy related prolapse in later life. Risk factors for significant vaginal birth injury include:
* A baby weighing more than 9 pounds.
* The use of forceps or vacuum for delivery. These markers are more likely to be signals for other abnormalities as forceps or vacuum are not used in normal deliveries.
* The need to repair large tears after delivery.

'''[[Pelvic girdle pain]]'''. Hormones and enzymes work together to produce ligamentous relaxation and widening of the symphysis pubis during the last trimester of pregnancy. Most girdle pain occurs before birthing, and is known as diastasis of the pubic symphysis. Predisposing factors for girdle pain include maternal obesity.

'''Infection''' remains a major cause of [[maternal mortality]] and morbidity in the developing world. The work of [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] was seminal in the pathophysiology and treatment of [[puerperal fever]] and saved many lives.

'''Hemorrhage,''' or heavy blood loss, is still the leading cause of death of birthing mothers in the world today, especially in the developing world. Heavy blood loss leads to [[hypovolemic shock]], insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated. Blood transfusion may be life saving. Rare sequelae include [[Hypopituitarism]] [[Sheehan's syndrome]].

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) varies from 9 per 100,000 live births in the US and Europe to 900 per 100,000 live births in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/9789241596213/en/index.html Maternal mortality in 2005].

===Fetal complications===

====Mechanical fetal injury====
Risk factors for fetal birth injury include [[fetal macrosomia]] (big baby), [[maternal obesity]], the need for instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant. Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and [[shoulder dystocia]]. Most fetal birth injuries resolve without long term harm, but [[brachial plexus injury]] may lead to [[Erb's palsy]] or [[Klumpke's paralysis]].<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046">{{cite book| title=Gray’s Anatomy | editor=Warwick, R., & Williams, P.L | edition=35th | publisher= Longman |location=London|year=1973 |page=1046}}</ref>

Neonates are prone to infection in the first month of life. Some organisms such as [[S. agalactiae]] (Group B Streptococcus) or (GBS) are more prone to cause these occasionally fatal infections. Risk factors for GBS infection include:
* prematurity (birth before 37 weeks gestation)
* a sibling who has had a [[Group B streptococcus|GBS]] infection
* prolonged labour or rupture of membranes

Untreated sexually transmitted infections are associated with congenital and perinatal infections in neonates, particularly in the areas where rates of infection remain high. The overall perinatal mortality rate associated with untreated syphilis, for example, approached 40%.<ref name="WHO-STI">{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|title=Sexually transmitted infections: Infections and Transmission|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs110/en/}}</ref>

====Neonatal death====
Infant deaths (''neonatal deaths'' from birth to 28 days, or ''perinatal deaths'' if including fetal deaths at 28 weeks gestation and later) are around 1% in modernized countries.

The most important factors affecting [[death|mortality]] in childbirth are adequate [[nutrition]] and access to quality medical care ("access" is affected both by the cost of available care, and distance from health services).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A 1983-1989 study by the [[Texas Department of State Health Services]] highlighted the differences in [[neonatal mortality]] (NMR) between high risk and low risk pregnancies. NMR was 0.57% for doctor-attended high risk births, and 0.19% for low risk births attended by non-nurse midwives. Conversely, some studies demonstrate a higher perinatal mortality rate with assisted home births.<ref name="waustraliafoot">{{Cite pmid|9694754}}</ref> Around 80% of pregnancies are low-risk. Factors that may make a birth high risk include prematurity, high blood pressure, [[gestational diabetes]] and a previous [[cesarean section]].

====Intrapartum asphyxia====
Intrapartum asphyxia is the impairment of the delivery of oxygen to the brain and vital tissues during the progress of labour. This may exist in a pregnancy already impaired by maternal or fetal disease, or may rarely arise ''de novo'' in labour. This can be termed ''[[fetal distress]]'', but this term may be emotive and misleading. True intrapartum asphyxia is not as common as previously believed, and is usually accompanied by multiple other symptoms during the immediate period after delivery. Monitoring might show up problems during birthing, but the interpretation and use of monitoring devices is complex and prone to misinterpretation. Intrapartum asphyxia can cause long-term impairment, particularly when this results in tissue damage through [[encephalopathy]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00431-007-0437-8 |title=Long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences of neonatal encephalopathy following perinatal asphyxia: A review |year=2007 |last1=Handel |first1=Mariëlle |last2=Swaab |first2=Hanna |last3=Vries |first3=Linda S. |last4=Jongmans |first4=Marian J. |journal=European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=166 |issue=7 |pages=645–54 |pmid=17426984 |pmc=1914268 }}</ref>

Different categories of [[birth attendant]]s may provide support and care during pregnancy and childbirth, although there are important differences across categories based on professional training and skills, practice regulations, as well as nature of care delivered.

“Childbirth educators” are instructors who aim to educate pregnant women and their partners about the nature of pregnancy, labour signs and stages, techniques for giving birth, breastfeeding and newborn baby care. In the United States and elsewhere, classes for training as a childbirth educator can be found in hospital settings or through many independent certifying organizations such as Birthing From Within, BirthWorks, The Bradley Method, Birth Arts International, CAPPA, HypBirth, HypnoBabies, HypnoBirthing, ICTC, ICEA, Lamaze, etc. Each organization teaches its own curriculum and each emphasizes different techniques. Information about each can be obtained through their individual websites.

[[Doula]]s are assistants who support mothers during pregnancy, labour, birth, and postpartum. They are not medical attendants; rather, they provide emotional support and non-medical pain relief for women during labour. Like childbirth educators and other [[unlicensed assistive personnel|assistive personnel]], certification to become a doula is not compulsory, thus, anyone can call themself a doula or a childbirth educator.

[[Midwifery|Midwives]] are autonomous practitioners who provide basic and emergency health care before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, generally to women with low-risk pregnancies. Midwives are trained to assist during labour and birth, either through direct-entry or nurse-midwifery education programs. Jurisdictions where midwifery is a regulated profession will typically have a registering and disciplinary body for quality control, such as the College of Midwives of British Columbia (CMBC) in Canada<ref>[http://www.cmbc.bc.ca/ College of Midwives of British Columbia.] Accessed 14 March 2011</ref> or the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC) in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.nmc-uk.org/ UK Nursing and Midwifery Council.] Accessed 14 March 2011</ref>

In jurisdictions where midwifery is not a regulated profession, [[traditional birth attendant|traditional or lay midwives]] may assist women during childbirth, although they do not typically receive formal health care education and training.

[[Doctor of Medicine|Medical doctors]] who practice [[obstetrics]] include categorically specialized [[obstetrics|obstetricians]]; [[family medicine|family practitioners]] and [[general practice|general practitioners]] whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics; and in some contexts [[general surgeon]]s. These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialized obstetricians are qualified [[surgeon]]s, so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include [[cesarean section]]s, [[episiotomy|episiotomies]], and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in obstetrics are commonly dually trained in [[obstetrics and gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN)]], and may provide other medical and surgical gynecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, [[primary care]] elements in their practices. [[Maternal-fetal medicine]] specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.

[[Anaesthetists]] or [[anesthesiologists]] are [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctors]] who specialise in pain relief and the use of drugs to facilitate surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing [[epidurals]] or by providing [[anaesthesia]] (often [[spinal anaesthesia]]) for [[Cesarean section]] or [[forceps delivery]].

[[Obstetrics gynecology nursing|Obstetric]] [[nurse]]s assist midwives, doctors, women, and babies before, during, and after the birth process, in the hospital system. Some midwives are also obstetric nurses. Obstetric nurses hold various [[Nursing board certification|certifications]] and typically undergo additional obstetric training in addition to standard [[Nursing school|nursing training]].

==Facilities==
Following are facilities that are particularly intended to house women during childbirth:
* A 'labour ward'', also called a ''delivery ward'' or ''labour and delivery'', is generally a [[Hospital department|department of a hospital]] that focuses on providing [[health care]] to women and their children during childbirth. It is generally closely linked to the hospital's [[neonatal intensive care unit]] and/or [[obstetric surgery]] unit if present. A ''maternity ward'' or ''maternity unit'' may include facilities both for childbirth and for [[postpartum]] rest and observation of mothers in normal as well as complicated cases.
* A [[birthing center]] generally presents a simulated home-like environment. Birthing centers may be located on hospital grounds or "free standing" (i.e., not hospital-affiliated).

In addition, it is possible to have a [[home birth]].

==Society and culture==

Childbirth routinely occurs in [[hospital]]s in much of Western society. Before the 20th century and in some countries to the present day it has more typically occurred at home.<ref name=stearns>{{cite book|last=Stearns|first=Peter N. |title=Encyclopedia of Social History |year=1994|isbn=0-8153-0342-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kkIeyCEedrsC}}</ref>

In Western and other cultures, age is reckoned from the date of birth, and sometimes the [[birthday]] is celebrated annually. [[East Asian age reckoning]] starts newborns at "1", incrementing each [[Lunar calendar|Lunar New Year]].

Some families view the [[placenta]] as a special part of birth, since it has been the child's life support for so many months.The [[placentophagy|placenta may be eaten]] by the newborn's family, ceremonially or otherwise (for nutrition; the great majority of animals in fact do this naturally).<ref>''[[Having a Great Birth in Australia]],'' [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Australian College of Midwives]], 2005 p56</ref> Most recently there is a category of birth professionals available who will encapsulate placenta for use as placenta medicine by postpartum mothers.

The [[locus in quo|exact location]] in which childbirth takes place is an important factor in determining [[nationality]], in particular for [[birth aboard aircraft and ships]].
