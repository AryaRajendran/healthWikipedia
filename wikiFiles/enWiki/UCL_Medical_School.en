'''UCL Medical School''' (formerly '''Royal Free & University College Medical School''')<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thecnj.com/camden/2008/092508/news092508_09.html?headline=Medical_school_victim_of_rebranding | title = Medical school victim of rebranding | author = Simon Wroe | publisher = ''[[Camden New Journal]]'' | date = 2008-09-25 | accessdate = 2008-09-27}}</ref> is the [[medical school]] of [[University College London]] (UCL) and is located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is one of the [[United Hospitals]].  

UCL has offered education in medicine since 1834 but the current school developed from mergers between UCL and the medical schools of the [[Middlesex Hospital]] (founded in 1746) and [[Royal Free Hospital|The Royal Free Hospital]] (founded as the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] in 1874).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medicalschool/about-medicalschool |title=UCL Medical School |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> 

Clinical medicine is primarily taught at [[University College Hospital]], The [[Royal Free Hospital]] and the [[Whittington Hospital]], with other associated teaching hospitals including the [[Eastman Dental Hospital]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], [[The Heart Hospital]], [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] and the [[Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital]].

==History==
[[File:UCL Portico Building.jpg|225px|right|thumb|The main portico of [[University College London]]]]
UCL Medical School formed over a number of years from the merger of a number of institutions:<ref name="UCLhist">History of UCL Medical School http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medicalschool/about-medicalschool/history</ref> 
*The [[Middlesex Hospital]] opened in Fitzrovia in 1745 and was training doctors since 1746.
*[[University College Hospital]] opened in 1834 as the North London Hospital, with the purpose of providing the then newly opened [[University College London]] with a hospital to train medical students after refusal by the governors of the Middlesex Hospital to share its facilities with UCL.

Middlesex Hospital and University College Hospital merged their medical schools in 1987 to form '''University College & Middlesex School of Medicine (UCMSM)'''. 

* The [[London School of Medicine for Women]] was established in 1874, as the first medical school in Britain to train women. In 1877 The Royal Free Hospital agreed to allow students from LSMW to complete their clinical studies there and by 1896 was renamed '''The London Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine for Women''' and became part of the [[University of London]].

In 1998 '''The Royal Free & University College Medical School''' (RFUCMS) was formed from the merger of the two medical schools. On 1 October 2008, it was officially renamed '''UCL Medical School'''. 

In appreciation of the historic beginnings of UCL Medical School, its student society has retained the name "RUMS" ('''R'''oyal Free, '''U'''niversity College and '''M'''iddlesex Medical '''S'''tudents Society) which runs clubs and societies within [[UCL Union|UCLU]].

==Teaching==
[[File:UCL Gower Street.jpg|right|225px|thumb|The Cruciform Building on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] houses the preclinical facilities of the UCL Medical School; it was previously the main building of [[University College Hospital]].]]
The medical school is one of the largest in the country with a yearly intake of 330 students.<ref name="statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmedicalschools.com/index.php?pageid=stats|title=www.ukmedicalschools.com UK Medical School Statistics|publisher=ukmedicalschools.com|accessdate=2008-09-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Undergraduate teaching is spread across three campuses based in Bloomsbury (the Cruciform, [[University College Hospital]], the [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital]]), at Archway (the [[Whittington Hospital]] and the former Royal Holborn Infirmary) and in Hampstead (the [[Royal Free Hospital]]).

It has arguably some of the best clinical sites in the country including:
[[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] (Queen's Square), [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], [[The Heart Hospital]], The [[Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital]] and the [[Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital]].

The school is widely regarded as one of the best medical schools in the country (frequently ranked between number 1&ndash;5 in the country), it has a very distinguished faculty which includes 78 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences amongst its staff.<ref>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/about-ucl/facts</ref>

A report published in November 2005, by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) found that RFUCMS had the highest expenditure per student, an average spend of £50,103 per student, of any medical school in the country, followed by [[Oxford University]] Medical School (£42,348) and [[Imperial College School of Medicine]] (£38,223).

===Course===

The course in medicine at UCL leads to the award of the [[MB BS]] and [[BSc]] (Hons) degrees and takes six years to complete: 2 years of preclinical medicine, 3 years of clinical medicine, and 1 year studying for the intercalated BSc degree, which at UCL is compulsory for all students except postgraduates.  UCL offers a wide variety of intercalation degrees ranging from the traditional subjects like anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, to more clinical courses such as Primary Health.  Students select their BSc subject by applying through an internal process during the second year of the programme.

There is also the opportunity to intercalate a PhD, either by taking an 'interruption of study' directly after the intercalated BSc, or as part of the integrated MB PhD programme. The latter has been offered by UCL medical school since 1994 and allows students to be offered the MB BS, BSc and PhD degrees in eight years rather than nine if the PhD is undertaken separately.

==Admission==

Admission to the medical school, in common with all 32 medical schools in the UK, is extremely competitive. Prospective students must apply through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). Acceptable qualifications for entry include grades AAA at [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]], to include at least Chemistry and Biology, and a pass at AS-level. The [[International Baccalaureate]] (Full Diploma), although less common, is also an acceptable entry qualification. Additionally, applicants must sit an entrance exam, the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] (BMAT).

== Clubs and societies ==
As well as being able to join all the UCL clubs and societies, medical students can also join those specifically for them. These clubs and societies are run by the Royal Free, University College and Middlesex Medical Students Society (RUMS) which is the [[Medsoc]] within [[UCL Union]] and as such is independent of the [[medical school]]. In 2011, [http://www.medicalsociety.org.uk UCLU Medical Society] was established providing careers advice and peer teaching for medical students, as well as special interest events. It is the largest medical student society at UCL Union, with 500 members.
