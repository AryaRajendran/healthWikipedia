==Synonyms and short history==
Lichen sclerosus (LS) is also known as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA), [[balanitis xerotica obliterans]] (BXO),  [[Csillag's disease]], Lichen albus, Hypoplastic dystrophy, White Spot Disease and [[kraurosis vulvae]]. Typically it's called LSA or BXO when it affects men, LS when it affects women or in referring to the disease in general. Sometimes, LS can be found on pediatric patients and men from all ages. Children being diagnosed with Lichen Scleroses is extremely rare. LS is usually found in the groin area, but sometimes on the upper leg or thigh.

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus was first described in 1887 by Dr. Hallopeau.<ref name="hallopeauh">{{cite journal | title=Du lichen plan et particulièrement de sa forme atrophique: lichen plan scléreux | last=Hallopeau | first=H | coauthors= | year=1887 | journal=Ann Dermatol Syphiligr (Paris) | issue=8 | volume= | pages=790–791 | pmid=}}</ref> Since not all cases of lichen sclerosus exhibit atrophic tissue, ''et atrophicus'' was dropped in 1976 by the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD), officially proclaiming the name ''lichen sclerosus''.<ref name="friedrichegjr">{{cite journal | title=Lichen sclerosus | last=Friedrich Jr. | first=EG | coauthors= | year=1976 | journal=J Reprod Med | issue=3 | volume=17 | pages=147–154 | pmid=135083}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Women are more commonly affected than men (10 to 1 ratio), particularly around and after [[menopause]], but younger women or girls may also develop the disease. The condition most commonly occurs on the [[vulva]] and around the [[anus]] with ivory-white elevations that may be flat and glistening. There may be marked itching or the condition may be without any symptoms. There may also be thinning and shrinkage of the genital area that may make [[coitus]], urination, and defecation painful. 

In males, the disease may take the form of whitish thickening of the foreskin, which cannot be retracted easily ([[phimosis]]).  In contrast to women, there is no perianal involvement. In men, this genital involvement has traditionally been known as [[balanitis xerotica obliterans]] (BXO).<ref>{{EMedicine|derm|46|Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans}}</ref>

On the non-genital skin, the disease may manifest as porcelain-white spots with small visible plugs inside the orifices of [[hair follicles]] or [[sweat glands]] on the surface. Thinning of the skin may also occur.<ref name="laymoncw">{{cite journal | title=Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and related disorders | last=Laymon | first=CW | coauthors= | year=1951 | journal=MA Arch Derm Syphilol | issue=5 | volume=64 | pages=620–627 | pmid=14867888 | doi=10.1001/archderm.1951.01570110090013}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Although it is not clear what causes LS, four theories have been postulated. Lichen Sclerosus is not contagious; it cannot be caught from another person.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Institute of Health|title=Fast Facts About Lichen Sclerosus|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/lichen_sclerosus/default.asp|work=Lichen Sclerosus|publisher=National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|accessdate=06/16/2012}}</ref> 

===Autoimmunity===
[[Autoimmunity]] is a process in which the body fails to recognize itself and therefore attacks its own cells and tissue. Specific [[antibodies]] have been found in LS. Furthermore, there seems to be a higher [[prevalence]] of other autoimmune diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], [[vitiligo]] and thyroid disease.<ref name="meyrickthomasrh">{{cite journal | title=Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and autoimmunity—a study of 350 women | last=Meyrick Thomas | first=RH | coauthors= Ridley, CM; McGibbon, DH; Black, MM| year=1988 | journal=Br J Dermatol | issue=1 | volume=188 | pages=41–46 | pmid=3342175}}</ref>

===Infection===
Both [[bacteria]]l as well as [[virus|viral]] pathogens have been implicated in the etiology of LS. A disease that is similar to LS, [[acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans]] is caused by the [[spirochete]] ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]''. Viral involvement of [[HPV]]<ref name="drutrm">{{cite journal | doi=10.1046/j.1525-1470.1998.1998015085.x | title=Human papillomavirus is present in some cases of childhood penile lichen sclerosus: an in situ hybridization and SP-PCR study | last=Drut| first=RM | coauthors=Gomez, MA; Drut, R; Lojo, MM| year=1998 | journal=Pediatr Dermatol | issue=2 | volume=15 | pages=85–90 | pmid=9572688}}</ref> and [[hepatitis C]]<ref name="yashars">{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.05707.x | title=Lichen sclerosus-lichen planus overlap in a patient with hepatitis C virus infection | last=Yashar| first=S | coauthors=Han, KF; Haley, JC| year=2004 | journal=Br J Dermatol | issue=1 | volume=150 | pages=168–169 | pmid=14746647}}</ref> are also suspected.

A link with [[Lyme Disease]] is shown by the presence of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' in LSA biopsy tissue.<ref name="Eisendle">{{cite journal | title=Possible Role of Borrelia burgdorferi Sensu Lato Infection in Lichen Sclerosus | last=Eisendle| first=K | coauthors=Grabner, TG; Kutzner, H| year=2008 | journal=Br J Dermatol | issue=5 | volume=144| pages=591–598| pmid=18490585 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.144.5.591}}</ref>

===Hormones===
Since LS in females is primarily found in women with a low [[estrogen]] state, hormonal influences were postulated. To date though, very little evidence has been found to support this theory.

===Local skin changes===
Some findings suggest that LS can be initiated through scarring<ref name="passcj">{{cite journal | title=An unusual variant of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus: delayed appearance in a surgical scar | last=Pass| first=CJ | coauthors= | year=1984 | journal=Cutis | issue=4 | volume=33 | pages=405 | pmid=6723373}}</ref> or radiation,<ref name="milligana">{{cite journal | title=Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus following sunburn | last=Milligan| first=A | coauthors= Graham-Brown, RA; Burns, DA| year=1988 | journal=Clin Exp Dermatol | issue=1 | volume=13 | pages=36–37 | pmid=3208439}}</ref><ref name="yatesvm">{{cite journal | doi=10.1001/archderm.121.8.1044 | title=Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus following radiation therapy | last=Yates| first=VM | coauthors= King, CM; Dave, VK| year=1985 | journal=Arch Dermatol | issue=8 | volume=121 | pages=1044–1047 | pmid=4026344}}</ref> although these findings were sporadic and very uncommon.

==Diagnosis==
The disease often goes undiagnosed for several years, as it is sometimes not recognized and misdiagnosed as [[Candidiasis|thrush]] or other problems and not correctly diagnosed until the patient is referred to a specialist when the problem does not clear up.

It is rare for a biopsy of the affected skin to be taken, especially so in children. A biopsy is only performed if there is suspicion of cancer or [[vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia]]. When a biopsy is done, [[hyperkeratosis]], atrophic epidermis, [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] of [[dermis]] and [[lymphocyte]] activity in dermis are histological findings associated with LS.<ref name="emed">{{EMedicine|derm|234|Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus}}</ref> The biopsies are also checked for signs of [[dysplasia]].<ref name="Shelley2006">{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02978.x}}</ref>

==Treatment==
LS is usually treated with potent topical [[steroids]], like [[Clobetasol propionate]]. These can relieve symptoms and prevent scarring.<ref name="goolamalisk">{{cite journal | title=Lichen sclerosus |journal=Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology | last1=Goolamali | first1= SK | last2= Goolamali |first2=SI |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |year=1997 |pmid=15511755 | doi=10.1080/01443619750113997}}</ref>  

[[Circumcision]] may be recommended in males to correct [[phimosis]]. It is not considered beneficial to remove LS-affected skin that is not located on the genitals, as it also tends to relapse. 

In females, recent studies indicate that the injection of PRP ([[Platelet-rich plasma]]) and [[stem cell]]s in site may reduce symptoms and improve lesions. The usefulness of this treatment in males is under study.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20885230|year=2010|last1=Casabona|first1=F|last2=Priano|first2=V|last3=Vallerino|first3=V|last4=Cogliandro|first4=A|last5=Lavagnino|first5=G|title=New surgical approach to lichen sclerosus of the vulva: The role of adipose-derived mesenchymal cells and platelet-rich plasma in tissue regeneration|volume=126|issue=4|pages=210e–211e|doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181ea9386|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery}}</ref>

A recent study has shown long-term antibiotic treatment to be effective with all patients, showing a significant response within a few weeks.<ref name="Shelley2006" />

==Psychology==

Distress due to the discomfort and pain of Lichen Sclerosus is normal, as are concerns with self-esteem and sex. Counseling can help.

According to the National Vulvodynia Association, which also supports women with Lichen Sclerosus, vulvo-vaginal conditions can cause feelings of isolation, hopelessness, low self-image, and much more. Some women are unable to continue working or have sexual relations, and may be limited in other physical activities.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Vulvodynia Association|title=Vulvodynia Fact Sheet|url=http://www.nva.org/fact_sheet.html|work=Vulvodynia Media Corner|publisher=National Vulvodynia Association|accessdate=06/16/2012}}</ref>  Depression, anxiety, and even anger are all normal responses to the ongoing pain LS patients suffer from.

==Prognosis==
The disease can last for a considerably long time. Occasionally, "spontaneous cure" may ensue,<ref>6.Smith SD, Fischer G. Childhood onset vulvar lichen sclerosus does not resolve at puberty: a prospective case series. Pediatr Dermatol. Nov-Dec 2009;26(6):725-9.</ref> particularly in young girls. 

Lichen sclerosus is associated with a higher risk of cancer.<ref name="nascamr">{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(99)70245-8 | title=Penile cancer among patients with genital lichen sclerosus | last=Nasca| first=MR | coauthors= Innocenzi, D; Micali, G| year=1999 | journal=J Am Acad Dermatol | issue=6 | volume=41 | pages=911–914 | pmid=10570372}}</ref><ref name="poulsenh">{{cite journal | title=Small vulvar squamous cell carcinomas and adjacent tissues.
