The identification of small, membrane-bound vesicles has opened a new era in the understanding of [[cell signaling]] and the process of molecular communication between cells.  Human body fluids contain small, membrane-bound [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]] and larger vesicular bodies, collectively referred to as circulating microvesicles (cMVs).  cMVs are released by a number of cell types during cellular activation and [[apoptosis]]. Although a consistent and precise definition is still lacking, cMVs are generally considered to be a heterogeneous population of small, membrane-covered vesicles whose diameter ranges from 50-1,000 nanometers(nm).<ref name=pmid19687520>{{cite journal |last1=Van Doormaal |first1=FF |last2=Kleinjan |first2=A |last3=Di Nisio |first3=M |last4=Büller |first4=HR |last5=Nieuwland |first5=R |title=Cell-derived microvesicles and cancer |journal=The Netherlands journal of medicine |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=266–73 |year=2009 |pmid=19687520 |url=http://www.zuidencomm.nl/njm/getarticle.php?v=67&i=7&p=266}}</ref><ref name=pmid20445011>{{cite journal |last1=Muralidharan-Chari |first1=V. |last2=Clancy |first2=J.

==Circulating microvesicle formation and contents==
cMVs, which were originally considered cellular debris, are now recognized as a heterogeneous population of membrane-bound vesicles that varies in cellular origin, number, size, and composition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camussi|first=G|coauthors=Deregibus, MC; Bruno, S; Cantaluppi, V; Biancone, L|title=Exosomes/microvesicles as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.|journal=Kidney international|date=2010 Nov|volume=78|issue=9|pages=838-48|pmid=20703216}}</ref> This heterogenous population can be broken down into two groups, shed microvesicles and exosomes, which are differentiated by the way they are formed, either by budding directly off of the plasma membrane or by fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. The contents of the circulating microvesicles can indicate their function as well as their origin<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camussi|first=G|coauthors=Deregibus, MC; Bruno, S; Cantaluppi, V; Biancone, L|title=Exosomes/microvesicles as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.|journal=Kidney international|date=2010 Nov|volume=78|issue=9|pages=838-48|pmid=20703216}}</ref>.

===Process of formation===
[[File:Exosome formation..tiff|thumb|right|300 px|The process of the formation of exosomes. Cell undergoes [[endocytosis]] forming [[endocytic vesicles]](1). Endocytic vesicles fuse together forming an early [[endosome]](2). Endocytic cisterna matures into exocytic multivesicular body, during which membrane invaginations form exosomes(3). Multivesicular body fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing exosomes into the extracellular space(4).]]
Microvesicles and [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]] are formed and released by two slightly different mechanisms.  These processes result in the release of intercellular signaling vesicles. Microvesicles are small, [[plasma-membrane]]-derived particles that are released into the extracellular environment by the outward budding and fission of the plasma membrane. This budding process involves multiple signaling pathways including the elevation of intracellular calcium and reorganization of the cell's structural scaffolding. The formation and release of microvesicles involve contractile machinery that draws opposing membranes together before pinching off the membrane connection and launching the vesicle into the extracellular space.<ref name=pmid19687520/><ref name=pmid20445011/><ref name=pmid19144520>{{cite journal |last1=Cocucci |first1=Emanuele |last2=Racchetti |first2=Gabriella |last3=Meldolesi |first3=Jacopo |title=Shedding microvesicles: artefacts no more |journal=Trends in Cell Biology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=43–51 |year=2009 |pmid=19144520 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2008.11.003}}</ref>

Microvesicle budding takes place at unique locations on the cell membrane that are enriched with specific lipids and proteins reflecting their cellular origin. At these locations, [[Membrane proteins|proteins]], [[Membrane lipids|lipids]], and [[nucleic acids]] are selectively incorporated into microvesicles and released into the surrounding environment.<ref name=pmid20445011/>

Exosomes are preformed, membrane-covered vesicles that are smaller than 150&nbsp;nm. In contrast to microvesicles, which are formed through a process of membrane budding, or [[exocytosis]], exosomes are initially formed by [[endocytosis]]. Exosomes are formed by invagination within a cell to create an intracellular vesicle called an [[endosome]], or an [[endocytic vesicle]]. In general, [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]] are formed by segregating the cargo (e.g., lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) within the endosome.  Once formed, the endosome combines with a structure known as a [[multivesicular body]] (MVB).  The MVB containing segregated endosomes ultimately fuses with the plasma membrane, resulting in exocytosis of the [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]].<ref name=pmid19144520/><ref name=pmid19132498>{{cite journal |last1=Pap |first1=E. |last2=Pállinger |first2=É. |last3=Pásztói |first3=M. |last4=Falus |first4=A. |title=Highlights of a new type of intercellular communication: microvesicle-based information transfer |journal=Inflammation Research |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19132498 |doi=10.1007/s00011-008-8210-7}}</ref>

Once formed, both microvesicles and [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]] (collectively called cMVs) circulate in the extracellular space near the site of release, where they can be taken up by other cells or gradually deteriorate. In addition, some vesicles migrate significant distances by diffusion, ultimately appearing in  biological fluids such as [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[blood]], and [[urine]].<ref name=pmid19144520/>

===Molecular content of cMVs===
The lipid and protein content of cMVs have been analyzed using various biochemical techniques. cMVs display a spectrum of molecules enclosed within the vesicles and their plasma membranes. Both the membrane molecular pattern and the internal contents of the vesicle depend on the cellular origin and the molecular processes triggering their formation. Because cMVs are not intact cells, they do not contain [[mitochondria]], [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], or a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] with its associated DNA.<ref name=pmid19132498/><ref name=pmid18331451>{{cite journal |last1=Schorey |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Bhatnagar |first2=Sanchita |title=Exosome Function: From Tumor Immunology to Pathogen Biology |journal=Traffic |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=871–81 |year=2008 |pmid=18331451 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00734.x}}</ref>

cMV membranes consist mainly of [[Membrane lipids|lipids]] and [[Membrane protein|proteins]].  Regardless of their cell type of origin, nearly all cMVs contain proteins involved in membrane transport and fusion. They are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer composed of several different lipid molecules. The protein content of each cMV reflects the origin of the cell from which it was released. For example, those released from antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as [[B cells]] and [[dendritic cells]], are enriched in proteins necessary for [[adaptive immunity]], while cMVs released from tumors contain proapoptotic molecules and oncogenic receptors (e.g. EGFR).<ref name=pmid19132498/>

In addition to the proteins specific to the cell type of origin, some proteins are common to most cMVs. For example, nearly all contain the cytoplasmic proteins tubulin, actin and actin-binding proteins, as well as many proteins involved in signal transduction, cell structure and motility, and transcription. Most cMVs contain the so-called "heat-shock proteins" [[hsp70]] and [[hsp90]], which can facilitate interactions with cells of the immune system. Finally, [[tetraspanin]] proteins, including [[CD9]], [[CD37]], [[CD63]] and [[CD81]] are one of the most abundant protein families found in cMV membranes.<ref name=pmid19132498/><ref name=pmid18331451/><ref name=pmid18780348>{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Richard J. |last2=Jensen |first2=Søren S. |last3=Lim |first3=Justin W.

Other than lipids and proteins, recent studies have also shown that cMVs are enriched with nucleic acids (e.g., messenger RNA ([[mRNA]]) and microRNA ([[miRNA]]). The identification of RNA molecules in cMVs supports the hypothesis that they are a biological vehicle for the transfer of nucleic acids and subsequently modulate the target cell's protein synthesis. Messenger RNA transported from one cell to another through cMVs can be translated into proteins, conferring new function to the target cell[7]. The discovery that cMVs may shuttle specific mRNA and miRNA suggests that this may be a new mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.<ref name=pmid17486113/><ref name=pmid19266099>{{cite journal |last1=Lewin |first1=Alfred |last2=Yuan |first2=Alex |last3=Farber |first3=Erica L. |last4=Rapoport |first4=Ana Lia |last5=Tejada |first5=Desiree |last6=Deniskin |first6=Roman |last7=Akhmedov |first7=Novrouz B. |last8=Farber |first8=Debora B. |title=Transfer of MicroRNAs by Embryonic Stem Cell Microvesicles |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4722 |year=2009 |pmid=19266099 |pmc=2648987 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004722 |editor1-last=Lewin |editor1-first=Alfred}}</ref> Recently, it was also shown that exosomes produced by cells exposed to [[oxidative stress]] can mediate protective signals, reducing oxidative stress in recipient cells, a process which is proposed to depend on exosomal RNA transfer.<ref>Eldh M, Ekström K, Valadi H, Sjöstrand M, Olsson B, Jernås M, Lötvall J. Exosomes Communicate Protective Messages during Oxidative Stress; Possible Role of Exosomal Shuttle RNA. PLoS One. 2010 Dec 17;5(12):e15353.</ref> 

Proteins associated with diseases such as [[kidney disease]] and [[prostate cancer]] have also been detected in cMVs, suggesting potential clinical utility.<ref name=pmid17486113/><ref name=pmid19442504>{{cite journal |last1=Simons |first1=Mikael |last2=Raposo |first2=Graça |title=Exosomes – vesicular carriers for intercellular communication |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=575–81 |year=2009 |pmid=19442504 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2009.03.007}}</ref> In fact, biochemical studies on cMVs have generated an expansive list of molecular signatures, demonstrating valuable potential for the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive use of cMVs.<ref name=pmid15958043>{{cite journal |last1=Hoorn |first1=Ewout J |last2=Pisitkun |first2=Trairak |last3=Zietse |first3=Robert |last4=Gross |first4=Peter |last5=Frokiaer |first5=Joergen |last6=Wang |first6=NAM SUN |last7=Gonzales |first7=Patricia A |last8=Star |first8=Robert A |last9=Knepper |first9=Mark A |title=Prospects for urinary proteomics: Exosomes as a source of urinary biomarkers (Review Article) |journal=Nephrology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=283–90 |year=2005 |pmid=15958043 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1797.2005.00387.x}}</ref>

Because the specific proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs in CMVs are highly variable, it is likely that these molecules are specifically packaged into vesicles using an active sorting mechanism. At this point, it is unclear exactly which mechanisms are involved in packaging soluble proteins and nucleic acids into cMVs.<ref name=pmid20445011/><ref name=pmid19442504/>

==Role on target cells==
Once released from their cell of origin. cMVs interact specifically with cells they recognize by binding to cell-type specific, membrane-bound receptors. Because cMVs contain a variety of surface molecules, they provide a mechanism for engaging different cell receptors and exchanging material between cells. This interaction ultimately leads to fusion with the target cell and release of the vesicles' components, thereby transferring bioactive molecules, lipids, genetic material, and proteins. The transfer of cMV components includes specific mRNAs and proteins, contributing to the proteomic properties of target cells.<ref>Valadi, Hadi; Ekström, Karin; Bossios, Apostolos; Sjöstrand, Margareta; Lee, James J; Lötvall, Jan O (2007). "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells". Nature Cell Biology 9 (6): 654–9. {{doi|10.1038/ncb1596}}. PMID 17486113</ref>  cMVs can also transfer miRNAs that are known to regulate gene expression by altering mRNA turnover.<ref name=pmid20445011/><ref name=pmid19144520/><ref name=pmid18331451/><ref name=pmid16453000>{{cite journal |last1=Ratajczak |first1=J |last2=Miekus |first2=K |last3=Kucia |first3=M |last4=Zhang |first4=J |last5=Reca |first5=R |last6=Dvorak |first6=P |last7=Ratajczak |first7=M Z |title=Embryonic stem cell-derived microvesicles reprogram hematopoietic progenitors: evidence for horizontal transfer of mRNA and protein delivery |journal=Leukemia |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=847–56 |year=2006 |pmid=16453000 |doi=10.1038/sj.leu.2404132}}</ref>
===Mechanisms of cMV signaling===
====Degradation====
In some cases, the degradation of cMVs are necessary for the release of [[signaling molecules]]. During cMV production, the cell can concentrate and sort the signaling molecules which are released into the extracellular space upon cMV degradation. Dendritic cells, macrophage and microglia derived cMVs contain [[proinflammatory cytokines]] and [[neurons]] and [[endothelial cells]] release [[growth factors]] using this mechanism of release. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cocucci|first=E|coauthors=Racchetti, G; Meldolesi, J|title=Shedding microvesicles: artefacts no more.|journal=Trends in cell biology|date=2009 Feb|volume=19|issue=2|pages=43-51|pmid=19144520}}</ref>
====Fusion====
Proteins on the surface of the cMV will interact with specific molecules, such as [[integrin]], on the surface of its target cell.  Upon binding, the cMV can fuse with the plasma membrane. This results in the delivery of nucleotides and soluble proteins into the cytosol of the target cell as well as the integration of lipids and membrane proteins into its plasma membrane. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Camussi|first=G|coauthors=Deregibus, MC; Bruno, S; Cantaluppi, V; Biancone, L|title=Exosomes/microvesicles as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.|journal=Kidney international|date=2010 Nov|volume=78|issue=9|pages=838-48|pmid=20703216}}</ref>
====Internalization====
cMV can be endocytosed upon binding to their targets, allowing for additional steps of regulation by the target cell. The cMV may fuse, integrating lipids and membrane proteins into the endosome while releasing its contents into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, the endosome may mature into a [[lysosome]] causing the degradation of the cMV and its contents, in which case the signal is ignored.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camussi|first=G|coauthors=Deregibus, MC; Bruno, S; Cantaluppi, V; Biancone, L|title=Exosomes/microvesicles as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.|journal=Kidney international|date=2010 Nov|volume=78|issue=9|pages=838-48|pmid=20703216}}</ref>
=====Transcytosis=====
After internalization of cMV via endocytosis, the endosome may move across the cell and fuse with the plasma membrane, a process called [[transcytosis]]. This results in the ejection of the cMV back into the extracellular space or may result in the transportation of the cMV into a neighboring cell. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Camussi|first=G|coauthors=Deregibus, MC; Bruno, S; Cantaluppi, V; Biancone, L|title=Exosomes/microvesicles as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.|journal=Kidney international|date=2010 Nov|volume=78|issue=9|pages=838-48|pmid=20703216}}</ref> This mechanism might explain the ability of cMV to cross biological barriers, such as the [[blood brain barrier]], by moving from cell to cell.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lakhal|first=S|coauthors=Wood, MJ|title=Exosome nanotechnology: an emerging paradigm shift in drug delivery: exploitation of exosome nanovesicles for systemic in vivo delivery of RNAi heralds new horizons for drug delivery across biological barriers.|journal=BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology|date=2011 Oct|volume=33|issue=10|pages=737-41|pmid=21932222}}</ref>

====Contact dependent signaling====
In this form of signaling, the cMV does not fuse with the plasma membrane or engulfed by the target cell. Similar to the other mechanisms of signaling, the cMV has molecules on its  surface that will interact specifically with its target cell. There are additional surface molecules, however, that can interact with receptor molecules which will interact with various signaling pathways.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cocucci|first=E|coauthors=Racchetti, G; Meldolesi, J|title=Shedding microvesicles: artefacts no more.|journal=Trends in cell biology|date=2009 Feb|volume=19|issue=2|pages=43-51|pmid=19144520}}</ref> This mechanism of action can be used in processes such as antigen presentation, where [[Major Histocompatibility Complex|MHC]] molecules on the surface of cMV can stimulate an immune response.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Raposo|first=G|coauthors=Stoorvogel, W|title=Extracellular vesicles: Exosomes, microvesicles, and friends.|journal=The Journal of cell biology|date=2013 Feb 18|volume=200|issue=4|pages=373-83|pmid=23420871}}</ref> Alternatively, there may be molecules on cMV surfaces that can recruit other proteins to form extracellular protein complexes that may be involved in signaling to the target cell. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cocucci|first=E|coauthors=Racchetti, G; Meldolesi, J|title=Shedding microvesicles: artefacts no more.|journal=Trends in cell biology|date=2009 Feb|volume=19|issue=2|pages=43-51|pmid=19144520}}</ref>

==Relevance in disease==
===Cancer===
====Promoting aggressive tumor phenotypes====
The oncogenic receptor [[ECGFvIII]], which is located in a specific type of aggressive [[glioma]] tumor, can be transferred to a non-aggressive population of tumor cells via cMVs. After the oncogenic protein is transferred, the recipient cells become transformed and show characteristic changes in the expression levels of target genes. It is possible that transfer of other mutant oncogenes, such as [[HER2]], may be a general mechanism by which malignant cells cause cancer growth at distant sites.<ref name=pmid20445011/><ref name=pmid16453000/>It has also been shown that cMVs from non-cancer cells can signal to cancer cells to become more aggressive. Upon exposure to cMVs from tumor-associated macrophages, breast cancer cells become more invasive ''in vitro''. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=M|coauthors=Chen, J; Su, F; Yu, B; Su, F; Lin, L; Liu, Y; Huang, JD; Song, E|title=Microvesicles secreted by macrophages shuttle invasion-potentiating microRNAs into breast cancer cells.|journal=Molecular cancer|date=2011 Sep 22|volume=10|pages=117|pmid=21939504}}</ref> 

====Promoting angiogenesis====
[[Angiogenesis]], which is essential for tumor survival and growth, occurs when endothelial cells proliferate to create a matrix of blood vessels that infiltrate the tumor, supplying the nutrients and oxygen necessary for tumor growth. A number of reports have demonstrated that tumor-associated cMVs release proangiogenic factors that promote endothelial cells proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. cMVs shed by tumor cells and taken up by endothelial cells also facilitate angiogenic effects by transferring specific mRNAs and miRNAs.<ref name=pmid19144520/>

====Involvement in multidrug resistance====
When anticancer drugs such as [[doxorubicin]] accumulate in cMVs, the drug's cellular levels decrease.  This can ultimately contribute to the process of drug resistance.  Similar processes have been demonstrated in cMVs released from [[cisplatin]]-insensitive cancer cells. Vesicles from these tumors contained nearly three times more cisplatin than those released from cisplatin-sensitive cells. For example, tumor cells can accumulate drugs into cMVs. Subsequently, the drug-containing cMVs are released from the cell into the extracellular environment, thereby mediating resistance to [[chemotherapeutic]] agents and resulting in significantly increased tumor growth, survival, and [[metastasis]].<ref name=pmid20445011/><ref name=pmid12907600>{{cite journal |last1=Shedden |first1=Kerby |last2=Xie |first2=Xue Tao |last3=Chandaroy |first3=Parthapratim |last4=Chang |first4=Young Tae |last5=Rosania |first5=Gustavo R. |title=Expulsion of small molecules in vesicles shed by cancer cells: association with gene expression and chemosensitivity profiles |journal=Cancer Research |volume=63 |issue=15 |pages=4331–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12907600 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12907600}}</ref>

====Interference with antitumor immunity====
cMVs from various tumor types can express specific cell-surface molecules (e.g. FasL or CD95) that induce [[T-cell]] apoptosis and reduce the effectiveness of other immune cells. cMVs released from [[lymphoblastoma]] cells express the immune-suppressing protein latent membrane protein-1 ([[LMP-1]]), which inhibits T-cell proliferation and prevents the removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). As a consequence, tumor cells can turn off T-cell responses or eliminate the antitumor immune cells altogether by releasing cMVs.<ref name=pmid20445011/>

====Impact on tumor metastasis====
Degradation of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor-derived cmVs often carry protein-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinase 2([[MMP-2]]), [[MMP-9]], and urokinase-type plasminogen activator ([[urokinase|uPA]]). By releasing these proteases, tumor cells can degrade the [[extracellular matrix]] and invade surrounding tissues. Likewise, inhibiting MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA prevents cMVs from facilitating tumor metastasis. Matrix digestion can also facilitate angiogenesis, which is important for tumor growth and is induced by the [[horizontal gene transfer| horizontal transfer]] of RNAs from microvesicles.<ref name=pmid20445011/>

===Other disease states===
The release of cMVs has been shown from endothelial cells, [[vascular smooth muscle cells]], [[platelets]]<ref name=Nieuwland2012>{{cite book|last=Nieuwland|first=R|title=Platelet-Derived Microparticles|year=2012|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0123878373|page=453-67}}</ref>, white blood cells (e.g. [[leukocytes]] and [[lymphocytes]]), and [[red blood cells]]. Although some of these cMV populations occur in the blood of health individuals and patients, there are obvious changes in number, cellular origin, and composition in various disease states.<ref name=pmid12909311>{{cite journal |last1=Vanwijk |first1=M |last2=Vanbavel |first2=E |last3=Sturk |first3=A |last4=Nieuwland |first4=R |title=Microparticles in cardiovascular diseases |journal=Cardiovascular Research |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=277–87 |year=2003 |pmid=12909311 |doi=10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00367-5}}</ref>It has become clear that cMVs play important roles in regulating the cellular processes that lead to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, because cMVs are released following apoptosis or cell activation, they have the potential to induce or amplify disease processes. Some of the inflammatory and pathological conditions that cMVs are involved in include [[cardiovascular disease]], [[hypertension]], [[neurodegenerative disorders]], [[diabetes]], and [[rheumatic diseases]].<ref name=pmid19144520/><ref name=pmid19132498/>

====Vascular diseases====
=====Thromboembolism=====
Circulating microvesicles isolated from cardiac surgery patients were shown to be thrombogenic both in vitro assays and in rats. Microvesicles isolated from healthy individuals did not have the same effects<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=14738565}}</ref>. [[Tissue factor]], an initiator of coagulation, is found in high levels within microvesicles, indicating their role in clotting<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12514112}}</ref>. Additionally, microvesicles can induce clotting by binding to clotting factors or by inducing the expression of clotting factors in other cells<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16255015}}</ref>.
=====Diabetic vasculopathy=====
Tissue factors in circulating microvesicles alter blood vessel properties. This mechanism is affected by [[hyperglycemia]] in [[diabetic]] patients, affecting their vasculature<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21160063}}</ref>.
=====Atherosclerosis=====
Circulating microvesicles are found in high levels within [[atherosclerotic plaques]]. This results in altered local cell communications, resulting in pathology<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19144520}}</ref>
=====Thrombosis=====
There is a proposed role of microvesicles in [[thrombosis]] as a result of their effects on clotting. Patients at risk for thrombosis show increased microvesicle levels from endothelial cells. In healthy individuals, there seems to be a role of microvesicles in reducing clotting. However, there seems to also be a pathogenic role in certain individuals, leading to diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16255015}}</ref>.

====Inflammation====
Microvesicles contain cytokines that can induce [[inflammation]] via numerous different pathways<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16255015}}</ref> . These cells will then release more microvesicles, which have an additive effect. This can call [[neutrophils]] and [[leukocytes]] to the area, resulting in the aggregation of cells<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camussi|first=G|coauthors=Deregibus, MC; Bruno, S; Cantaluppi, V; Biancone, L|title=Exosomes/microvesicles as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.|journal=Kidney international|date=2010 Nov|volume=78|issue=9|pages=838-48|pmid=20703216}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20571541}}</ref>. However, microvesicles also seem to be involved in a normal physiological response to disease as there are increased levels of microvesicles that result from pathology.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16255015}}</ref>

====Neurological Disorders====
Microvesicles seem to be involved in a number of neurological diseases. Since they are involved in numerous vascular diseases and inflammation, [[strokes]] and [[multiple sclerosis]] seem to be other diseases for which microvesicles are involved. Circulating microvesicles seem to have an increased level of phosphorylated [[tau proteins]] during early stage [[Alzheimers disease]]. Similarly, increased levels of [[CD133]] are an indicator of [[epilepsy]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Colombo|first=E|coauthors=Borgiani, B; Verderio, C; Furlan, R|title=Microvesicles: novel biomarkers for neurological disorders.|journal=Frontiers in physiology|date=2012|volume=3|pages=63|pmid=22479250}}</ref>.

==Clinical applications of microvesicles==
===Detection of cancer===
Tumor-associated cMVs are abundant in the blood, urine, and other body fluids of patients with cancer, and are likely involved in tumor progression. They offer a unique opportunity to noninvasively access the wealth of biological information related to their cells of origin. The quantity and molecular composition of cMVs released from [[malignant]] cells varies considerably compared with those released from normal cells.  Thus, the concentration  of plasma cMVs with molecular markers indicative of the disease state may be used as an informative blood-based biosignature for cancer.<ref name=pmid19687520/>cMVs express many membrane-bound proteins, some of which can be used as tumor biomarkers. Several tumor markers accessible as proteins in blood or urine have been used to screen and diagnose various types of cancer. In general, tumor markers are produced either by the tumor itself or by the body in response to the presence of cancer or some inflammatory conditions. If a tumor marker level is higher than normal, the patient is examined more closely to look for cancer or other conditions. For example, [[CA19-9]], [[CA-125]], and [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|CEA]] have been used to help diagnose [[pancreatic cancer|pancreatic]], [[ovarian cancer|ovarian]], and [[gastrointestinal cancer|gastrointestinal]] malignancies, respectively. However, although they have proven clinical utility, none of these tumor markers are highly sensitive or specific. Clinical research data suggests that tumor-specific markers exposed on cMVs are useful as a clinical tool to diagnose and monitor disease. Research is also ongoing to determine if tumor-specific markers exposed on cMVs are predictive for therapeutic response.<ref name=pmid20121479>{{cite journal |last1=Larkin |first1=Samantha ET |last2=Zeidan |first2=Bashar |last3=Taylor |first3=Matthew G |last4=Bickers |first4=Bridget |last5=Al-Ruwaili |first5=Jamal |last6=Aukim-Hastie |first6=Claire |last7=Townsend |first7=Paul A |title=Proteomics in prostate cancer biomarker discovery |journal=Expert Review of Proteomics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=93–102 |year=2010 |pmid=20121479 |doi=10.1586/epr.09.89}}</ref><ref name=aacr2010abs3018>{{cite conference |url=http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=ab4788a7-757c-403c-a00e-404cd806d69f&cKey=f9c04582-7650-457a-b4d6-c34f59f8ef85&mKey={0591FA3B-AFEF-49D2-8E65-55F41EE8117E} |title=Identifying and characterizing subpopulation of exosomes to provide the foundation for a novel exosome-based cancer diagnostic platform |first1=Traci L. |last1=Pawlowski |first2=David |last2=Spetzler |first3=Teresa |last3=Tinder |first4=Paula |last4=Esmay |first5=Amber |last5=Conrad |first6=Phil |last6=Ellis |first7=Patrick |last7=Kennedy |first8=Annemarie |last8=Tyrell |first9=Unnati |last9=Jariwala |date=April 20, 2010 |conference=Proceedings of the 101st Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research}}</ref><ref name=ASCO2010Kuslich>{{cite conference |url=http://www.exosome.com/uploads/ASCO_2010_PCa_Poster.pdf |title=A Sensitive exosome-based biosignature for the diagnosis of prostate cancer |first1=Christine |last1=Kuslich |first2=Traci L. |last2=Pawlowski |first3=Ta |last3=Deng |first4=Teresa |last4=Tinder |first5=Joon |last5=Kim |first6=Jeff |last6=Kimbrough |first7=David |last7=Spetzler |year=2010 |conference=Proceedings of the 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting}} Also published as {{cite journal |first1=Christine |last1=Kuslich |first2=Traci L. |last2=Pawlowski |first3=Ta |last3=Deng |first4=Teresa |last4=Tinder |first5=Joon |last5=Kim |first6=Jeff |last6=Kimbrough |first7=David |last7=Spetzler |month=May |year=2010 |title=A sensitive exosome-based biosignature for the diagnosis of prostate cancer |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=28 |issue=15 suppl |pages=4636 |url=http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/15_suppl/4636}}</ref><ref name=AACR2010abs821>{{cite conference |url=http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=85df317d-3f42-484c-a7ce-892d25db17d1&cKey=67ab48d8-ba36-49e6-a764-8d321699bc5d&mKey=%7b0591FA3B-AFEF-49D2-8E65-55F41EE8117E%7d |title=Plasma exosomes are a robust biosignature for prostate cancer |first1=Christine |last1=Kuslich |first2=Traci |last2=Pawlowski |first3=Jeff |last3=Kimbrough |first4=Ta |last4=Deng |first5=Teresa |last5=Tinder |first6=Joon |last6=Kim |first7=David |last7=Spetzler |date=April 18, 2010 |conference=Proceedings of the 101st Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research}} Also published as {{cite web |first1=Christine |last1=Kuslich |first2=Traci |last2=Pawlowski |first3=Jeff |last3=Kimbrough |first4=Ta |last4=Deng |first5=Teresa |last5=Tinder |first6=Joon |last6=Kim |first7=David |last7=Spetzler |title=Circulating exosomes are a robust biosignature for prostate cancer |url=http://www.carislifesciences.com/media/pdf/Kuslich_C.pdf |publisher=Caris Life Sciences |year=2010}}</ref>
===Biological markers for disease===
In addition to detecting cancer, it is possible to use microvesicles as biological markers to give prognoses for various diseases. Many types of neurological diseases are associated with increased level of specific types of circulating microvesicles. For example, elevated levels of phosphorylated tau proteins can be used to diagnose patients in early stages of Alzheimer's. Additionally, it is possible to detect increased levels of CD133 in microvesicles of patients with epilepsy<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22479250}}</ref>.  
===Mechanism for drug delivery===
Circulating microvesicles may be useful for the delivery of drugs to very specific targets. Using [[electroporation]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21932222}}</ref>  or [[centrifugation]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=D|coauthors=Zhuang, X; Xiang, X; Liu, Y; Zhang, S; Liu, C; Barnes, S; Grizzle, W; Miller, D; Zhang, HG|title=A novel nanoparticle drug delivery system: the anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin is enhanced when encapsulated in exosomes.|journal=Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy|date=2010 Sep|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1606-14|pmid=20571541}}</ref> to insert drugs into microvesicles targeting specific cells, it is possible to target the drug very efficiently. This targeting can help by reducing necessary doses as well as prevent off target side effects. It has been shown to target anti-inflammatory drugs to specific tissues<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20571541}}</ref>. Additionally, it has been shown that circulating microvesicles can bypass the blood brain barrier and deliver their cargo to neurons while leaving muscle cells alone. The blood brain barrier is typically a difficult obstacle to overcome when designing drugs, and microvesicles may be a means of overcoming it<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lakhal|first=S|coauthors=Wood, MJ|title=Exosome nanotechnology: an emerging paradigm shift in drug delivery: exploitation of exosome nanovesicles for systemic in vivo delivery of RNAi heralds new horizons for drug delivery across biological barriers.|journal=BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology|date=2011 Oct|volume=33|issue=10|pages=737-41|pmid=21932222}}</ref>.
