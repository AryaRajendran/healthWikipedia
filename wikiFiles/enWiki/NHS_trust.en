A '''National Health Service trust''' provides services on behalf of the [[National Health Service (England)|English NHS]] and [[NHS Wales]].

The trusts are not [[Trust law|trusts]] in the legal sense but are in effect public sector corporations. Each trust is headed by a [[board of directors|board]] consisting of [[executive director|executive]] and [[non-executive director]]s, and is [[chairman|chaired]] by a non-executive director. Non-executive directors are recruited by open advertisement. 

All trust boards are required to have an audit committee consisting only of non-executive directors, on which the chair may not sit. This committee is entrusted not only with supervision of financial [[audit]], but of systems of [[corporate governance]] within the trust.
