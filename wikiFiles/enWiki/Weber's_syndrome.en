'''Weber's syndrome''' (superior alternating hemiplegia) is a form of [[stroke]] characterized by the presence of an [[oculomotor nerve palsy]] and contralateral [[hemiparesis]] or hemiplegia.

==Cause and presentation==
This lesion is usually unilateral and affects several structures in the midbrain including:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure damaged
! Effect
|-
| [[substantia nigra]] 
| [[contralateral]] [[parkinsonism]] because its dopaminergic projections to the [[basal ganglia]] innervate the ipsilateral hemisphere motor field, leading to a movement disorder of the contralateral body.
|-
| [[corticospinal]] fibers 
| contralateral hemiparesis and typical [[upper motor neuron]] findings. It is contralateral because it occurs before the decussation in the medulla.
|-
| [[corticobulbar]] tract 
| difficulty with contralateral lower facial muscles and [[hypoglossal nerve]] functions
|-
| [[oculomotor nerve]] fibers 
| [[ipsilateral]] [[oculomotor nerve palsy]] with a drooping eyelid and fixed wide pupil pointed down and out. This leads to [[diplopia]]

It is caused by [[midbrain]] [[infarction]] as a result of occlusion of the [[paramedian branches]] of the [[posterior cerebral artery]] or of basilar bifurcation perforating arteries.<ref>{{GPnotebook|-932511721|Weber's syndrome}}</ref>

==History==
It carries the name of Sir [[Hermann David Weber]], a German-born physician working in London, who described the condition in 1863.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Weber HD | title=A contribution to the pathology of the crura cerebri | journal=Medico-Chirurgical Transactions | year=1863 | volume=46 | pages=121â€“139}}</ref><ref>{{Whonamedit|synd|407|Weber's syndrome}}</ref> It is unrelated to [[Sturge-Weber syndrome]], [[Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome]] or [[Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome]].
