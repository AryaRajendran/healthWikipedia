'''Rubella''', also known as '''German measles''' or '''three-day measles''',<ref name=Neighbors2010>{{cite book|last=Neighbors|first=M|last2=Tannehill-Jones|first2=R|title=Human diseases|edition=3rd|chapter=Childhood diseases and disorders|pages=457–79|publisher=Delmar, Cengage Learning|location=Clifton Park, New York|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4354-2751-8}}</ref> is a [[disease]] caused by the [[rubella virus]]. The name "rubella" is derived from Latin, meaning ''little red''. Rubella is also known as German measles because the disease was first described by German physicians in the mid-eighteenth century. This disease is often mild and attacks often pass unnoticed. The disease can last one to three days. Children recover more quickly than adults. Infection of the mother by Rubella virus during pregnancy can be serious; if the mother is infected within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, the child may be born with [[congenital rubella syndrome]] (CRS), which entails a range of serious incurable illnesses. Spontaneous abortion occurs in up to 20% of cases.<ref name="pmid5581012">{{cite journal

Rubella is a common childhood infection that can sometimes be fatal usually with minimal systemic upset although transient [[arthropathy]] may occur in adults. Serious complications such as deterioration of the skin are very rare. Apart from the effects of transplacental infection on the developing fetus, rubella is a relatively trivial infection.

Acquired (i.e. not congenital) rubella is transmitted via airborne droplet emission from the upper respiratory tract of active cases (can be passed along by the breath of people sick from Rubella). The virus may also be present in the urine, feces and on the skin. There is no carrier state: the reservoir exists entirely in active human cases. The disease has an [[incubation period]] of 2 to 3 weeks.<ref name="pmid11332662">{{cite journal

}}</ref> In most people the virus is rapidly eliminated. However, it may persist for some months post partum in infants surviving the CRS. These children are a significant source of infection to other infants and, more importantly, to pregnant female contacts.

The name ''rubella'' is sometimes confused with ''rubeola'', an alternative name for [[measles]] in English-speaking countries; the diseases are unrelated.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rubeola Merriam-webster:Rubeola] Accessed 2009-09-20.</ref><ref>T. E. C. Jr. [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/49/1/150-a Letters to the editor] ''Pediatrics'' Vol. 49 No. 1 January 1972, pp. 150-151.</ref> In some other European languages, like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''rubella'' and ''rubeola'' are synonyms, and ''rubeola'' is not an alternative name for [[measles]].<ref>[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Ge/German_measles.html Webster's Online Dictionary: German measles] Accessed 2009-09-20</ref> Thus, in Spanish, "rubeola" refers to rubella and "sarampión" refers to measles.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Rash of rubella on skin of child's back.JPG|thumb|Rash of rubella on skin of child's back. Distribution is similar to that of measles but the lesions are less intensely red.]]
After an incubation period of 14–21 days, German measles causes symptoms that are similar to the flu. The primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub occipital & posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache and conjunctivitis.<ref name="pmid16022642">{{cite journal

}}</ref> 

The swollen [[gland]]s or [[lymph nodes]] can persist for up to a week and the [[fever]] rarely rises above 38 <sup>o</sup>C (100.4 <sup>o</sup>F). The rash of German measles is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red [[papule]]s on the area of the [[soft palate]].

Rubella can affect anyone of any age and is generally a mild disease, rare in infants or those over the age of 40. The older the person is the more severe the symptoms are likely to be. Up to two-thirds of older girls or women experience joint pain or arthritic type symptoms with rubella. The virus is contracted through the respiratory tract and has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks. During this incubation period, the patient is contagious typically for about one week before he/she develops a rash and for about one week thereafter.

===Congenital rubella syndrome===
{{main|Congenital rubella syndrome}}
Rubella can cause [[congenital rubella syndrome]] in the newly born. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the Rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory defects.<ref name="pmid15259032">{{cite journal

Many mothers who contract rubella within the first critical trimester either have a miscarriage or a still born baby. If the baby survives the infection, it can be born with severe heart disorders ([[Patent ductus arteriosus]] being the most common), blindness, deafness, or other life threatening organ disorders. The skin manifestations are called "blueberry muffin lesions".<ref name="pmid16580940"/>
For these reasons, Rubella is included on the [[TORCH complex]] of perinatal infections.

==Cause==
{{main|Rubella virus}}

The disease is caused by Rubella virus, a [[togavirus]] that is enveloped and has a single-stranded RNA genome.<ref name="pmid7817880">{{cite journal

|doi=10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60328-0
}}</ref> The virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the [[nasopharynx]] and [[lymph nodes]]. The virus is found in the blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. The virus has [[teratogenic]] properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them.<ref name="pmid16022642"/>

Increased susceptibility to infection might be inherited as there is some indication that [[HLA-A1]] or factors surrounding A1 on [[HLA A1-B8 haplotype|extended haplotype]]s are involved in virus infection or non-resolution of the disease.<ref name="pmid12463994">{{cite journal |author=Forrest JM, Turnbull FM, Sholler GF, ''et al.'' |title=Gregg's congenital rubella patients 60 years later |journal=Med.

==Prevention==
{{Further|MMR vaccine}}
Rubella infections are prevented by active [[immunisation]] programs using live, disabled virus [[vaccine]]s. Two live attenuated virus vaccines, RA 27/3 and Cendehill strains, were effective in the prevention of adult disease. However their use in prepubertile females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of CRS in the UK. Reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children.

The vaccine is now usually given as part of the [[MMR vaccine]]. The [[WHO]] recommends the first dose is given at 12 to 18 months of age with a second dose at 36 months. Pregnant women are usually tested for immunity to rubella early on. Women found to be susceptible are not vaccinated until after the baby is born because the vaccine contains live virus.<ref name="pmid9639369">{{cite journal

The [[Immunization (medicine)|immunisation]] program has been quite successful.

Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by [[serology]] is recommended in the United States for all women of childbearing age at their first [[preconception counseling]] visit to reduce incidence of [[congenital rubella syndrome]] (CRS).<ref name=icsi2010>[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition.] By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement July 2010.</ref> It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant women of childbearing age should be offered rubella vaccination.<ref name=icsi2010/> Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of [[MMR vaccine]] is not recommended during pregnancy.<ref name=icsi2010/> Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the [[postpartum period]].<ref name=icsi2010/>

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for Rubella; however, management is a matter of responding to symptoms to diminish discomfort. Treatment of newly born babies is focused on management of the complications. [[Congenital heart defects]]{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} and [[cataracts]] can be corrected by direct surgery.<ref name="pmid17197734">{{cite journal

==Epidemiology==
Rubella is a disease that occurs worldwide. The virus tends to peak during the spring in countries with temperate climates. Before the vaccine to rubella was introduced in 1969, widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 6–9 years in the United States and 3–5 years in Europe, mostly affecting children in the 5-9 year old age group.<ref name="pmid11798368">{{cite journal
