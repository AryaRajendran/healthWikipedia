[[Image:Death rate world map.PNG|thumb|250px|Crude death rate by country (2006).]]

'''Mortality rate''' is a measure of the number of [[death]]s (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a population. 
Scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time.  Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from [[morbidity rate]], which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the [[prevalence rate]]) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time ([[incidence rate]]). The term "[[Death|mortality]]" is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to  the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury, rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group. This disease mortality statistic is more precisely referred to as "[[case fatality rate]]" (CFR).

One distinguishes:
# The '''crude death rate''', the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people. {{As of|2009|July}} the crude death rate for the whole world is about 8.37 per 1000 per year according to the current CIA World Factbook.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html CIA World Factbook -- Rank Order - Death rate] Search for "World".
</ref>
# The '''[[perinatal mortality]] rate''', the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths (stillbirths) per 1000 births.
# The '''[[maternal mortality]] ratio''', the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in same time period.
# The '''[[maternal mortality]] rate''', the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population (generally defined as 15–44 years of age) .
# The '''[[infant mortality]] rate''', the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live births.
# The '''[[child mortality]] rate''', the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live births.
# The '''[[standardised mortality ratio]]''' (SMR)- This represents a proportional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age, gender, etc.<ref>Everitt, B.S. ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics'', CUP. ISBN 0-521-81099-X</ref>
# The '''[[age-specific mortality rate]]''' (ASMR) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age (e.g. age 62 last birthday).

In regard to the [[wikt:success|success]] or [[failure]] of [[medicine|medical]] treatment or [[surgery|procedures]], one would also distinguish:

# The '''early mortality rate''', the total number of deaths in the early stages of an ongoing treatment, or in the period immediately following an [[wiktionary:acute|acute]] treatment.
# The '''late mortality rate''', the total number of deaths in the late stages of an ongoing treatment, or a significant length of time after an acute treatment.

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. The crude death rate depends on the age (and gender) specific mortality rates and the age (and gender) distribution of the population. The number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite life expectancy being higher in developed countries due to standards of health being better. This happens because developed countries typically have a completely different population age distribution, with a much higher proportion of older people, due to both lower recent [[birth rate]]s and lower mortality rates. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]] which shows the mortality rate separately for each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of [[life expectancy]].

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the 10 leading causes of death in 2002 were:
<!-- ref: http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf -->

# 12.6% [[Ischaemic heart disease]]
#  9.7% [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
#  6.8% [[Lower respiratory infections]]
#  4.9% [[HIV/AIDS]]
#  4.8% [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]
#  3.2% [[Diarrhoeal diseases]]
#  2.7% [[Tuberculosis]]
#  2.2% [[Trachea cancer|Trachea]]/[[Bronchus cancer|bronchus]]/[[lung cancer]]s
#  2.2% [[Malaria]]
#  2.1% [[Road traffic accidents]]

Causes of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.  See [[list of causes of death by rate]] for worldwide statistics.

[[Image:Income death in logs graph.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Scatter plot of the [[natural logarithm]] of the crude death rate against the natural log of per capita real GDP. The slope of the trend line is the elasticity of the crude death rate with respect to per capita real income. It indicates that a 10% increase in per capita real income is associated with a 1.5% decrease in the crude death rate. ''Source: World Development Indicators''.]]

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".<ref name=Ziegler>[[Jean Ziegler]], ''L'Empire de la honte'', Fayard, 2007 ISBN 978-2-253-12115-2, p.130.</ref>

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011">{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011}}</ref> In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/>

==Use in Health Care==
Early recording of mortality rate in European cities proved highly useful in controlling the [[plague (disease)|plague]] and other major [[epidemics]].<ref>Greenwood M. Medical Statistics from Graunt to Farr. The Fitzpatrick Lectures for the Years 1941 to1943. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1948.</ref> Public health in industrialized countries was transformed when mortality rate as a function of age, sex and socioeconomic status emerged in the late 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>Jha P. Avoidable mortality in India: past progress and future prospects. Natl Med J India. 2002;15 Suppl 1:32-6.</ref><ref>Jha P. Reliable mortality data: a powerful tool for public health. Natl Med J India. 2001;14:129-31. PMid:11467137</ref> This track record has led to the argument that inexpensive recording of vital statistics in developing countries may become the most effective means to improve [[global health]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jha|first=Prabhat|title=Counting the dead is one of the world’s best investments to reduce premature mortality|journal=Hypothesis|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.5779/hypothesis.v10i1.254|url=http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=1301}}</ref> Gathering official mortality statistics can be very difficult in developing countries, where many individuals lack the ability or knowledge to report incidences of death to National Vital Statistics Registries. This can lead to distortion in mortality statistics and a wrongful assessment of overall health. Studies conducted in northeastern Brazil, where underreporting of infant mortality is of huge concern, have shown that alternative methods of data collection, including the use of “popular Death Reporters” (Members of the community who are active in traditional death rituals of the child and the family grieving process), have been very successful in providing valid, qualitative mortality statistics, effectively reducing underreporting.<ref>http://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/stable/pdfplus/648673.pdf?acceptTC=true</ref>
