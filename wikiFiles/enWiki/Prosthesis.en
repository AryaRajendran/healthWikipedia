In [[medicine]], a '''prosthesis''', (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''prósthesis'', "addition, application, attachment")<ref>{{LSJ|pro/sqesis|πρόσθεσις|cite}}</ref> is an artificial device that replaces a missing [[body]] part lost through trauma, disease, or congenital conditions. 

==Types==
[[File:Wtcrun-001.jpg|right|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] with bilateral prosthetic legs leads a formation run.]]
The main types of prostheses, [[Craniofacial prosthesis|craniofacial]] and [[Somato prosthesis|somato]] (body), can be divided further by anatomical region. [[Craniofacial prosthesis|Craniofacial prostheses]] include intra-oral and extra-oral prostheses. Extra-oral prostheses are further divided into hemifacial, [http://www.genesisprostheticarts.com/facialprosthetics/auricularearprosthetics.html auricular] (ear), [http://www.medicalartresources.com/services-directory/facial-prosthetics/ nasal], [[Orbital prosthesis|orbital]] and [[Ocular prosthesis|ocular]]. Intra-oral prostheses include dental prostheses such as [[dentures]], [[Obturator|obturators]], and [[dental implants]]. Somato prostheses include [[Breast prostheses|breast]] and [[Prostheses|limb prostheses]]. [[Breast prostheses]] include full breast devices and [[Nipple prosthesis|nipple prostheses]]. Limb Prostheses include upper extremity and lower extremity prostheses. Upper extremity prostheses are used at varying levels of amputation: shoulder disarticulation, [[transhumeral prosthesis|transhumeral]], elbow disarticulation, [[transradial prosthesis|transradial]], wrist disarticulation, full hand, partial hand, finger, partial finger. Lower extremity prostheses are also used at varying levels of amputation. These include hip disarticulation, [[transfemoral prosthesis|transfemoral]], knee disarticulation, [[transtibial prosthesis|transtibial]], symes, foot, partial foot, and toe. The type of prostheses needed will be designed and assembled according to the patient's appearance and functional needs. For instance, a patient may need a transradial prosthesis, but need to choose between an aesthetic functional device, a myoelectric device, a body-powered device, or an activity specific device. Depending on the patient's funding situation, she may have the option to choose more than one device.

======Shoulder Disarticulation======

======Transhumeral======
A [[transhumeral prosthesis]] is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing above the elbow. Transhumeral amputees experience some of the same problems as transfemoral amputees, due to the similar complexities associated with the movement of the elbow. This makes mimicking the correct motion with an artificial limb very difficult. In the prosthetic industry a trans-humeral prosthesis is often referred to as a "AE" or above the elbow prothesis.

======Elbow Disarticulation======

======Transradial======
A [[transradial prosthesis]] is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing below the elbow. Two main types of prosthetics are available. Cable operated limbs work by attaching a harness and cable around the opposite shoulder of the damaged arm. The other form of prosthetics available are [[myoelectric]] arms. These work by sensing, via [[electrode]]s, when the muscles in the [[Arm|upper arm]] moves, causing an artificial hand to open or close. In the prosthetic industry a trans-radial prosthetic arm is often referred to as a "BE" or below elbow prosthesis.

======Transfemoral======
A [[transfemoral prosthesis]] is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing above the knee. Transfemoral amputees can have a very difficult time regaining normal movement. In general, a transfemoral amputee must use approximately 80% more energy to walk than a person with two whole legs.<ref name="four">[http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/leg/default.htm "Getting an Artificial Leg Up"], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 2000. Retrieved 11 February 2007.</ref> This is due to the complexities in movement associated with the knee. In newer and more improved designs, hydraulics, carbon fiber, mechanical linkages, motors, computer microprocessors, and innovative combinations of these technologies are employed to give more control to the user. In the prosthetic industry a trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.<ref>''Physics: A First Course.'' "Connections, designing a better prosthetic leg"</ref>

======Knee Disarticulation======

======Transtibial======
A [[transtibial prosthesis]] is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing below the knee. Transtibial amputees are usually able to regain normal movement more readily than someone with a transfemoral amputation, due in large part to retaining the knee, which allows for easier movement.  Lower extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are 1.trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency) and 2.trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency). In the prosthetic industry a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a "BK" or below the knee prosthesis while the trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.

==History==
[[File:Prosthetic toe.jpg|thumb|Prosthetic toe from ancient Egypt]]
Prosthetics have been mentioned throughout history. The earliest recorded mention is the warrior queen [[Vishpala]] in the [[Rigveda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

Another early mention of a prosthetic comes from the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who tells the story of [[Hegesistratus]], a Greek [[Divination|diviner]] who cut off his own foot to escape his [[Sparta]]n captors and replaced it with a wooden one.<ref>Herodotus, ''The Histories''. 9.37</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]] also recorded that a Roman general who had his arm cut off had an iron one made to hold his shield up when he returned to battle. A famous and quite refined<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlofgermany.com/Goetz.htm |title=The Iron Hand of the Goetz von Berlichingen |publisher=Karlofgermany.com |accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> historical prosthetic arm was that of [[Götz von Berlichingen]], made at the beginning of the 16th century. 

[[File:A Visit To the Artificial Limbs Factory, Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, November 1941 D5731.jpg|thumbnail|left|An artificial limbs factory in 1941]]
Around the same time, [[François de la Noue]] is also reported to have had an iron hand, as is, in the 1600s century, [[Cavalier de la Salle|René-Robert Cavalier de la Salle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/shorthistoryofca00bryc |title=Bryce, Geore, '&#39;A Short History of the Canadian People'&#39; |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> During the Dark Ages, prosthetics remained quite basic in form. Debilitated knights would be fitted with prosthetics so they could hold up a shield. Only the wealthy could afford anything that would assist in daily life. During the Renaissance, prosthetics developed with the use of iron, steel, copper, and wood. Functional prosthetics began to make an appearance in the 1500s. 

[[Götz von Berlichingen]], a German mercenary, developed a pair of iron hands that could be moved by a series of catches and springs. An Italian surgeon recorded the existence of an amputee who had an arm that allowed him to remove his hat, open his purse, and sign his name.<ref>Romm, Sharon, "Arms by Design: From Antiquity to the Renaissance," Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. July, 1988.</ref> Improvement in amputation surgery and prosthetic design came at the hands of Ambroise Paré. Among his inventions was an above-knee device that was a kneeling peg leg and foot prosthesis with a fixed position, adjustable harness, and knee lock control. The functionality of his advancements showed how future prosthetics could develop. 

Other major improvements before the modern era:

* [[Pieter Verduyn]] - First nonlocking below-knee (BK) prosthesis.
* [[James Potts]] - Prosthesis made of a wooden shank and socket, a steel knee joint and an articulated foot that was controlled by catgut tendons from the knee to the ankle. Came to be known as “Anglesey Leg” or “Selpho Leg.”
* [[Sir James Syme]] - A new method of ankle amputation that did not involve amputating at the thigh.
* [[Benjamin Palmer]] - Improved upon the Selpho leg. Added an anterior spring and concealed tendons to simulate natural-looking movement.
* [[Dubois Parmlee]] – Created prosthetic with a suction socket, polycentric knee, and multi-articulated foot.
* [[Marcel Desoutter]] & [[Charles Desoutter]] – First aluminum prosthesis<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.amputee-coalition.org/inmotion/nov_dec_07/history_prosthetics.html | work=inMotion: A Brief History of Prosthetics | title=A Brief History of Prosthetics| date=November/December 2007| accessdate=23 November 2010}}</ref>

At the end of World War II, the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) began to advocate better research and development of prosthetics. Through government funding, a research and development program was developed within the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Veterans Administration.

===Lower extremity modern history===
Socket technology for lower extremity limbs saw a revolution of advancement during the 1980s when John Sabolich C.P.O., invented the Contoured Adducted Trochanteric-Controlled Alignment Method (CATCAM) socket, later to evolve into the Sabolich Socket. He followed the direction of Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open ended plug socket, created from wood.<ref name="Long">{{cite journal | url=http://www.oandplibrary.org/cpo/pdf/1985_04_009.pdf | title=Normal Shape-Normal Alignment (NSNA) Above-Knee Prosthesis | author=Long, Ivan A. | journal=Clin Prosthet Orthot | year=1985 | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=9–14}}</ref> The advancement was due to the difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior, sockets were made in the shape of a square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variation’s of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.<ref name="Gottschalk-Kourosh-Stills">{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/jpojournal/Citation/1989/10000/Does_Socket_Configuration_Influence_the_Position.9.aspx | title=Does Socket Configuration Influence the Position of the Femur in Above-Knee Amputation? | author=Gottschalk, Frank A.; Kourosh, Sohrab; Stills, Melvin; McClellan, Bruce; Roberts, Jim | journal=Journal of Prosthetics & Orthotics | year=1989 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=94–102}}</ref>

The first microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees became available in the early 1990s. The Intelligent Prosthesis was first commercially available microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee. It was released by Chas. A. Blatchford & Sons, Ltd., of Great Britain, in 1993 and made walking with the prosthesis feel and look more natural.<ref>[http://www.blatchford.co.uk/company/history/history.html “History of Prosthetics”], Blatchford & Sons, Ltd. Retrieved 16 March 2008.</ref>  An improved version was released in 1995 by the name Intelligent Prosthesis Plus. Blatchford released another prosthesis, the Adaptive Prosthesis, in 1998.  The Adaptive Prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls, pneumatic controls, and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed. Cost analysis reveals that a sophisticated above knee prosthesis will be in the neighborhood of $1 million in 45 years, given only annual cost of living adjustments.<ref name=PikeAlvin/>

==Current technology/manufacturing==
[[File:WorkNC-Knee prosthesis.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Knee prosthesis manufactured using [[WorkNC]] [[Computer Aided Manufacturing]] software]]
Over the years there have been significant advancements in artificial limbs. New plastics and other materials, such as [[carbon fiber]], have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. This is especially important for transfemoral amputees. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic, which is important to transradial and transhumeral amputees because they are more likely to have the artificial limb exposed.<ref name="three">{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Artificial-Limb.html |title=How artificial limb is made - Background, Raw materials, The manufacturing process of artificial limb, Physical therapy, Quality control |publisher=Madehow.com |date=1988-04-04 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>
[[File:Journal.pone.0019508.g004 prosthetic finger.png|left|thumb|Manufacturing a prosthetic finger]]
In addition to new materials, the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs. Myoelectric limbs, which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals, have become much more common than cable operated limbs. Myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes, the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently, all myoelectric controls lag. Conversely, cable control is immediate and physical, and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not. Computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs. [[CAD/CAM|Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing]] are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs.<ref name="three" />

Most modern artificial limbs are attached to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by [[suction]]. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit  the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.

One problem with the stump and socket attachment is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the stump and socket or liner, and increase pockets between stump skin and socket or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes. Further down the road, it can cause breakdown of the skin.<ref name="four">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/leg/default.htm |title=Getting an artificial leg up - Cathy Johnson |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

Artificial limbs are typically manufactured using the following steps:<ref name="three" />
#Measurement of the stump
#Measurement of the body to determine the size required for the artificial limb
#Fitting of a silicone liner
#Creation of a model of the liner worn over the stump
#Formation of [[thermoplastic]] sheet around the model – This is then used to test the fit of the prosthetic
#Formation of permanent socket
#Formation of plastic parts of the artificial limb – Different methods are used, including [[vacuum forming]] and [[injection molding]]
#Creation of metal parts of the artificial limb using [[die casting]]
#Assembly of entire limb

===Body-powered arms===

Current high tech allows body powered arms to weigh around half to only a third of the weight that a myoelectric arm has.

====Sockets====
Current body powered arms contain sockets that are built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber. These sockets or "interfaces" can be made more comfortable by lining them with a softer, compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences. A self suspending or supra-condylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid range below elbow absence. Longer limbs may require the use of a locking roll-on type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension.

====Wrists====
Wrist units are either screw-on connectors featuring the UNF 1/2-20 thread (USA) or quick release connector, of which there are different models.

====Voluntary opening and voluntary closing====
Two types of body powered systems exist, voluntary opening "pull to open" and voluntary closing  "pull to close". Virtually all "split hook" prostheses operate with a voluntary opening type system. 

More modern "prehensors" called GRIPS utilize voluntary closing closing systems. The differences are significant. Users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or springs for gripping force, while users of voluntary closing systems rely on their own body power and energy to create gripping force. 

Voluntary closing users can generate prehensive forces equivalent to the normal hand, upwards to or exceeding one hundred pounds. Voluntary closing GRIPS require constant tension to grip, like a human hand, and in that property they do come closer to matching human hand performance. Voluntary opening split hook users are limited to forces their rubber or springs can generate which usually is below twenty pounds.

====Feedback====
An additional difference exists in the biofeedback created that allows the user to "feel" what is being held. Voluntary opening systems once engaged provide the holding force so that they operate like a passive vice at the end of the arm. No gripping feedback is provided once the hook has closed around the object being held. Voluntary closing systems provide directly proportional control and biofeedback so that the user can feel how much force that they are applying.

====Terminal devices====
Terminal devices contain a range of hooks, prehensors, hands or other devices.

=====Hooks=====
Voluntary opening split hook systems are simple, convenient, light, robust, versatile and relatively affordable. Hooks obviously do not match human hand in both appearance and overall versatility. 

However, a hook's material tolerances can also exceed and surpass the human hand for mechanical stress (one can use a hook to slice open boxes or as a hammer whereas same is not possible with a hand), for thermal stability (one can use a hook to grip items from boiling water, to turn meat on a grill, to hold a match until it has burned down completely) and for chemical hazards (as a metal hook withstands acids or lye, and does not react to solvents as a prosthetic glove or human skin does).

=====Hands=====

Prosthetic hands are available in both voluntary opening and voluntary closing versions and because of their more complex mechanics and cosmetic glove covering require a relatively large activation force, which, depending on the type of harness used, may be uncomfortable.<ref>{{Cite journal

====Commercial providers, materials====
Hosmer and Otto Bock are major commercial hook providers. Mechanical hands are sold by Hosmer and Otto Bock as well; the Becker Hand is still manufactured by the Becker family. Prosthetic hands may be fitted with standard stock or custom made cosmetic looking silicone gloves. But regular work gloves may be worn as well. Other terminal devices include the V2P Prehensor, a versatile robust gripper that allows customers to modify aspects of it, Texas Assist Devices (with a whole assortment of tools) and TRS that offers a range of terminal devices for sports. Cable harnesses can be built using aircraft steel cables, ball hinges and self lubricating cable sheaths.

===Lower extremity prosthetics===
Lower extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are 1.trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency) and 2.trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency). In the prosthetic industry a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a "BK" or below the knee prosthesis while the trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.

Other, less prevalent lower extremity cases include the following:
#Hip disarticulations - This usually refers to when an amputee or congenitally challenged patient has either an amputation or anomaly at or in close proximity to the hip joint.
#Knee disarticulations - This usually refers to an amputation through the knee disarticulating the femur from the tibia.
#Symes - This is an ankle disarticulation while preserving the heel pad.

====C-Leg knee prosthesis====
{{advert|section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:CLegProfile.jpg|frame|right|Two different models of the C-Leg prosthesis]]
The [[Otto Bock]] Orthopedic Industry introduced the '''C-Leg''' during the World Congress on Orthopedics in Nuremberg in 1997.  The company began marketing the C-Leg in the United States in 1999.<ref name=MartinCraigW/> Other microprocessor-controlled knee prostheses include Ossur's Rheo Knee, released in 2005, the Power Knee by [[Ossur]], introduced in 2006, the Plié Knee from Freedom Innovations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedom-innovations.com/knees/index.html |title=Retrieved 14 April 2009 |publisher=Freedom-innovations.com |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> and DAW Industries’ Self Learning Knee (SLK).<ref>[http://www.daw-usa.com/Pages/SLK3.html “The SLK, The Self-Learning Knee”], DAW Industries. Retrieved 16 March 2008.</ref>

The idea was originally developed by Kelly James, a Canadian engineer, at the [[University of Alberta]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/20/health/menshealth/20marrbox.html |title = Titanium and Sensors Replace Ahab's Peg Leg |accessdate=2008-10-30 |work= The New York Times |date= 2005-06-20 | first=Michel | last=Marriott}}</ref> The C-Leg uses [[hydraulic cylinders]] to control the flexing of the knee. Sensors send signals to the microprocessor that analyzes these signals, and communicates what resistance the hydraulic cylinders should supply. C-Leg is an abbreviation of 3C100, the model number of the original prosthesis, but has continued to be applied to all Otto Bock microprocessor-controlled knee prostheses. The C-Leg functions through various technological devices incorporated into the components of the prosthesis. The C-Leg uses a knee-angle sensor to measure the angular position and [[angular velocity]] of the flexing joint. Measurements are taken up to fifty times a second. The knee-angle sensor is located directly at the axis of rotation of the knee.<ref name=OttoBockMicroprocessorKnees>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080330150625/http://www.ottobockus.com/products/lower_limb_prosthetics/c-leg.asp “Otto Bock Microprocessor Knees”], [[Otto Bock]]. Retrieved 16 March 2008.</ref>

Moment sensors are located in the tube adapter at the base of the C-Leg. These moment sensors use multiple [[strain gauge]]s to determine where the force is being applied to the knee, from the foot, and the magnitude of that force.<ref name=OttoBockMicroprocessorKnees/>

The C-Leg controls the resistance to rotation and extension of the knee using a hydraulic cylinder. Small valves control the amount of [[hydraulic fluid]] that can pass into and out of the cylinder, thus regulating the extension and compression of a piston connected to the upper section of the knee.<ref name=PikeAlvin>Pike, Alvin (May/June 1999). “The New High Tech Prostheses”. InMotion Magazine 9 (3)</ref> The microprocessor receives signals from its sensors to determine the type of motion being employed by the amputee. The microprocessor then signals the hydraulic cylinder to act accordingly. The microprocessor also records information concerning the motion of the amputee that can be downloaded onto a computer and analyzed. This information allows the user to make better use of the prosthetic.<ref name=OttoBockMicroprocessorKnees/>

The C-Leg is powered by a [[lithium-ion battery]] housed inside the prosthesis near the knee joint. On a full charge, the C-leg can operate for up to 45 hours, depending on the intensity of use. A charging port located on the front of the knee joint can be connected to a charging cable plugged directly into a standard outlet.<ref name=FAQ>[http://www.ottobock.com/cps/rde/xchg/ob_com_en/hs.xsl/7071.html “FAQ: Questions and Answers on the C-Leg.”], [[Otto Bock]]. Retrieved 1 April 2008.</ref> A "pigtail" charging port adapter permits the relocation of the charging port to a location more accessible when the prosthesis has a cosmetic cover applied. The charger cord has lights that allow the user to observe the level of charge when connected to the knee. A 12 volt car charger adapter can also be purchased.

The C-Leg provides certain advantages over conventional mechanical knee prostheses. It provides an approximation to an amputee’s natural gait. The C-Leg allows amputees to walk at near walking speed. Variations in speed are also possible and are taken into account by sensors and communicated to the microprocessor, which adjusts to these changes accordingly. It also enables the amputees to walk down stairs with a step-over-step approach, rather than the one step at a time approach used with mechanical knees.<ref name=MartinCraigW>Martin, Craig W. (November 2003) “Otto Bock C-leg: A review of its effectiveness”. WCB Evidence Based Group</ref>  The C-Leg’s ability to respond to sensor readings can help amputees recover from stumbles without the knee buckling.<ref>[http://www.ottobock.com/cps/rde/xchg/ob_com_en/hs.xsl/1913.html?id=2897#t2897 “High-Tech for more Quality of Life”], [[Otto Bock]]. Retrieved 16 March 2008.</ref> However, the C-Leg has some significant drawbacks that impair its use. The C-Leg is susceptible to water damage and thus great care must be taken to ensure that the prosthesis remains dry. Otto Bock recommends that each amputee use the C-Leg for up to two months before the system can fully become accustomed to the individual’s unique gait. Becoming accustomed to the C-Leg is especially difficult when walking downhill, and amputees should seek help while becoming familiar with the system to avoid injury.<ref name=MartinCraigW/>

A wide range of amputees can make use of the C-Leg; however, some people are more suited to this prosthesis than others. The C-Leg is designed for use on people who have undergone transfemoral amputation, or amputation above the knee. The C-Leg can be used by amputees with either single or bilateral limb amputations. In the case of bilateral amputations, the application of C-Legs must be closely monitored. In some cases, those who have undergone hip disarticulation amputations can be candidates for a C-Leg.<ref name=ClinicalTechnicalInfo>[http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/C-LegTechnical.asp “Clinical and Technical Information”]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, [[Otto Bock]]. Retrieved 16 March 2008.</ref> The prosthesis is recommended for amputees that vary their walking speeds and can reach over 3 miles per hour; however, it cannot be used for running. The C-Leg is practical for upwards of 3 miles daily, and can be used on uneven ground, slopes, or stairs.  Active amputees, such as bikers and rollerbladers may find the C-Leg suited to their needs. 

Certain physical requirements must be met for C-Leg use. The amputee must have satisfactory cardiovascular and pulmonary health. The balance and strength of the amputee must be sufficient to take strides while using prosthesis. The C-Leg is designed to support amputees weighing up to 275 pounds.<ref name=ClinicalTechnicalInfo/>

===Myoelectric===
A '''myoelectric prosthesis''' uses [[electromyography]] signals or potentials from voluntarily contracted muscles within a person's residual limb on the surface of the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation (rotation) or hand opening/closing of the fingers. A prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuro-muscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist or elbow.
This is as opposed to an electric switch prosthesis, which requires straps and/or cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of a prosthesis or one that is totally mechanical.
It is not clear whether those few prostheses that provide feedback signals to those muscles are also myoelectric in nature.
It has a self suspending socket with pick up electrodes placed over flexors and extensors for the movement of flexion and extension respectively.

The first commercial myoelectric arm was developed in 1964 by the [[Central Prosthetic Research Institute]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and distributed by the [[Hangar Limb Factory]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{Cite journal

===Robotic prostheses===
{{Main|Neural prosthetics}}
{{Further|Robotics#Touch}}

In order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work, it must have several components to integrate it into the body's function:
[[Biosensors]] detect signals from the user's nervous or muscular systems. It then relays this information to a controller located inside the device, and processes feedback from the limb and actuator (e.g., position, force) and sends it to the controller. Examples include wires that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes implanted in muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. One type of these biosensors are employed in [[myoelectric prosthesis]].

Mechanical sensors process aspects affecting the device (e.g., limb position, applied force, load) and relay this information to the biosensor or controller.  Examples include force meters and accelerometers.

The [[Controller (computing)|controller]] is connected to the user's nerve and muscular systems and the device itself. It sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device, and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user. The controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device.

An [[actuator]] mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement. Examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue.

Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a technique in which [[motor nerve]]s which previously controlled [[muscle]]s on an amputated limb are [[surgery|surgically]] rerouted such that they reinnervate a small region of a large, intact muscle, such as the [[pectoralis major]]. As a result, when a patient thinks about moving the thumb of his missing hand, a small area of muscle on his chest will contract instead. By placing sensors over the reinervated muscle, these contractions can be made to control movement of an appropriate part of the robotic prosthesis.<ref name="six">{{Cite journal|author=Kuiken TA, Miller LA, Lipschutz RD, Lock BA, Stubblefield K, Marasco PD, Zhou P, Dumanian GA |title=Targeted reinnervation for enhanced prosthetic arm function in a woman with a proximal amputation: a case study |journal=Lancet |date= February 3, 2007 |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=371–80 |pmid=17276777 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60193-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/22730/ |title=Blogs: TR Editors' blog: Patients Test an Advanced Prosthetic Arm |work=Technology Review |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

An emerging variant of this technique is called targeted sensory reinnervation (TSR). This procedure is similar to TMR, except that [[sensory nerve]]s are surgically rerouted to [[skin]] on the chest, rather than motor nerves rerouted to muscle. The patient then feels any sensory stimulus on that area of the chest, such as pressure or temperature, as if it were occurring on the area of the amputated limb which the nerve originally innervated. In the future, artificial limbs could be built with sensors on fingertips or other important areas. When a stimulus, such as pressure or temperature, activated these sensors, an electrical signal would be sent to an actuator, which would produce a similar stimulus on the "rewired" area of chest skin. The user would then feel that stimulus as if it were occurring on an appropriate part of the artificial limb.<ref name="six"/>

Recently, robotic limbs have improved in their ability to take signals from [[Human brain|the human brain]] and translate those signals into motion in the artificial limb. [[DARPA]], the Pentagon’s research division, is working to make even more advancements in this area. Their desire is to create an artificial limb that ties directly into the [[nervous system]].<ref name="seven">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/sn07-43.htm |title=Defense Sciences Office |publisher=Darpa.mil |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

====Robotic arms====
Advancements in the processors used in myoelectric arms has allowed to make gains in fine tuned control of the prosthetic. The [[Boston Digital Arm]] is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors. The arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel. Recently the [[i-Limb hand]], invented in Edinburgh, Scotland, by [[David Gow]] has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. The hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision, power and key grip modes.<ref name="five">[http://www.sigmorobot.com/technology/news/boston_digital_arm.htm "Advanced Signal Processing Dramatically Improves Capability of Artificial Limbs"]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, SIGMO Technology, 2005.

Early in 2013, Max Ortiz Catalan and Rickard Brånemark of the Chalmers University of Technology, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden, suceeded in making the first robotic arm which is mind-controlled and can be permanently attached to the body (using osseointegration).<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130222075730.htm World Premiere of Muscle and Nerve Controlled Arm Prosthesis]</ref><ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/thought-controlled-prosthetic-arm/25216/ Permanently attached robotic arm, operated on mind-control]</ref><ref>[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/sectors/medical-and-healthcare/news/trials-imminent-for-implantable-thought-controlled-robotic-arm/1014779.article Max Ortiz Catalan and his robotic arm]</ref>

====Robotic legs====
[[Robotic leg]]s exist too: the [[Argo Medical Technologies]] [[ReWalk]] is an example or a recent robotic leg, targeted to replace the [[wheelchair]]. It is marketed as a "robotic pants".<ref>[http://trendsupdates.com/rewalk-robotic-pants-can-help-paralysed-patients-stand-up-and-walk-again/ ReWalk robotic pants]</ref>

==Attachment to the body==
Most prostheses can be attached to the exterior of the body, in a non-permanent way. Some others however can be attached in a permanent way. One such example are exoprostheses (see below).

===Direct bone attachment / osseointegration===
{{Main|Osseointegration}}
[[Osseointegration]] is a new method of attaching the artificial limb to the body. This method is also sometimes referred to as [[exoprosthesis]] (attaching an artificial limb to the bone), or endo-exoprosthesis.  

The stump and socket method can cause significant pain in the amputee, which is why the direct bone attachment has been explored extensively. The method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone at the end of the stump. After several months the [[osseointegration|bone attaches itself]] to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt. The abutment extends out of the stump and the (removable) artificial limb is then attached to the abutment. Some of the benefits of this method include the following:
*Better muscle control of the prosthetic.
*The ability to wear the prosthetic for an extended period of time; with the stump and socket method this is not possible.
*The ability for transfemoral amputees to drive a car.
The main disadvantage of this method is that amputees with the direct bone attachment cannot have large impacts on the limb, such as those experienced during jogging, because of the potential for the bone to break.<ref name="four"/>

==Cosmesis==
Cosmetic prosthesis has long been used to disguise injuries and disfigurements. With advances in modern technology, [[cosmesis]], the creation of lifelike limbs made from [[silicone]] or [[PVC]] has been made possible. Such prosthetics, such as artificial hands, can now be made to mimic the appearance of real hands, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints and even tattoos.
Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive (costing thousands of US dollars, depending on the level of detail), while standard cosmeses come ready-made in various sizes, although they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways, using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.

==Cognition==
{{Main|Neuroprosthetics}}

Unlike neuromotor prostheses, neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute or augment cognitive processes such as [[executive function]], [[attention]], language, and memory. No neurocognitive prostheses are currently available but the development of implantable neurocognitive brain-computer interfaces has been proposed to help treat conditions such as [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[autism]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="Serruya MD, Kahana MJ 2008 149">{{Cite journal|journal= Behav Brain Res |year=2008 |title= Techniques and devices to restore cognition |author= Serruya MD, Kahana MJ |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.04.007 |pmid=18539345 |volume= 192 |issue= 2|pages= 149–65|pmc= 3051349}}</ref>
The recent field of [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15764275 Assistive Technology for Cognition] concerns the development of technologies to augment human cognition.  Scheduling devices such as [http://www.neuropage.nhs.uk/default.asp?id= Neuropage] remind users with memory impairments when to perform certain activities, such as visiting the doctor. Micro-prompting devices such as PEAT, [http://www.ablelinktech.com/ AbleLink] and [http://stir.academia.edu/AlexGillespie/Papers/97289/Simulating-naturalistic-instruction--The-case-for-a-voice-mediated-interface-for-assistive-technology-for-cognition Guide] have been used to aid users with memory and executive function problems perform [[activities of daily living]].

In addition to the standard artificial limb for everyday use, many amputees or [[congenital]] patients have special limbs and devices to aid in the participation of sports and recreational activities.

Within science fiction, and, more recently, within the [[scientific community]], there has been consideration given to using advanced prostheses to replace healthy body parts with artificial mechanisms and systems to improve function. The morality and desirability of such technologies are being debated. Body parts such as legs, arms, hands, feet, and others can be replaced.

The first experiment with a healthy individual appears to have been that by the British scientist [[Kevin Warwick]]. In 2002, an implant was interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system. The [[electrode array]], which contained around a hundred [[electrode]]s, was placed in the [[median nerve]]. The signals produced were detailed enough that a [[robot arm]] was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm and provide a form of touch feedback again via the implant.<ref name="Warwick,K 1373">Warwick,K, Gasson,M, Hutt,B, Goodhew,I, Kyberd,P, Andrews,B, Teddy,P and Shad,A. “The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems”, ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003</ref>

;Oscar Pistorius
In early 2008, [[Oscar Pistorius]], the "Blade Runner" of South Africa, was briefly ruled ineligible to compete in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] because his transtibial prosthesis limbs were said to give him an unfair advantage over runners who had ankles.  One researcher found that his limbs used twenty-five percent less energy than those of an able-bodied runner moving at the same speed.  This ruling was overturned on appeal, with the appellate court stating that the overall set of advantages and disadvantages of Pistorius' limbs had not been considered.  Pistorius did not qualify for the South African team for the Olympics, but went on to sweep the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], and has been ruled eligible to qualify for any future Olympics. He qualified for the 2011 World Championship in South Korea and reached the semifinal  where he ended last timewise, he was 14th in the first round, his personal best at 400m would have given him 5th place in the finals. 

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, Pistorius became the first amputee runner to compete at an Olympic Games.<ref>{{citation|author=Robert Klemko|title=Oscar Pistorius makes history, leaves without medal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/track/story/2012-08-10/4x400-relay-oscar-pistorius-south-afric/56946372/1|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69qCZG7ST|archivedate=11 August 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=10 August 2012}}</ref> He ran in the [[athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics&nbsp;– Men's 400 metres|400&nbsp;metres race]] semifinals;,<ref name="BBC 20120804">{{citation|title=Oscar Pistorius makes Olympic history in 400m at London 2012|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18911479|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Bill Chappell|title=Oscar Pistorius makes Olympic history in 400 meters, and moves on to semifinal|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/08/04/158126486/oscar-pistorius-makes-olympic-history-in-400-meters-and-moves-on-to-semifinal|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fiw3sEg|archivedate=4 August 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=4 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Men's 400m&nbsp;– semifinals|url=http://www.london2012.com/athletics/event/men-400m/phase=atm004200/index.html|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> and the [[athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics&nbsp;– Men's 4 × 400 metres relay|4&nbsp;×&nbsp;400&nbsp;metres relay race]] finals.<ref>{{citation|title=Oscar Pistorius, South African 4×400m relay team finish 8th as Bahamas wins gold|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/oscar-pistorius-south-africa-relay-4x400-olympics_n_1765596.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69qCxjdgj|archivedate=11 August 2012|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 August 2012}}</ref>

==Design considerations==
There are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis. Manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors.

===Performance===
Nonetheless, there are certain elements of socket and foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete, and these are the focus of today’s high-tech prosthetics companies:
*Fit - athletic/active amputees, or those with bony residua, may require a carefully detailed socket fit; less-active patients may be comfortable with a 'total contact' fit and gel liner
*Energy storage and return – storage of energy acquired through ground contact and utilization of that stored energy for propulsion
*Energy absorption – minimizing the effect of high impact on the musculoskeletal system
*Ground compliance – stability independent of terrain type and angle
*Rotation – ease of changing direction
*Weight – maximizing comfort, balance and speed
*Suspension - how the socket will join and fit to the limb≈

===Other===
The buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors:
*Cosmetics
*Cost
*Ease of use
*Size availability

==Cost==
{{Multiple issues|section=y| advert = October 2010| primarysources = October 2010}}
Transradial and transtibial prostheses typically cost between US [[United States dollar|$]]6,000 and $8,000. Transfemoral and transhumeral prosthetics cost approximately twice as much with a range of $10,000 to $15,000 and can sometimes reach costs of $35,000. The cost of an artificial limb does recur because artificial limbs are usually replaced every 3–4 years due to [[wear and tear]].  In addition, if the socket has fit issues, the socket must be replaced within several months. If height is an issue components can be changed, such as the pylons.<ref name="eight">[http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/07/05/cost_of_prosthetics_stirs_debate/ "Cost of Prosthetics Stirs Debate"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 5 July 2005. Retrieved 11 February 2007.</ref>

Low cost above knee prostheses often provide only basic structural support with limited function. This function is often achieved with crude, non-articulating, unstable, or manually locking knee joints. A limited number of organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), create devices for developing countries. Their device which is manufactured by CR Equipments is a single-axis, manually operated locking polymer prosthetic knee joint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0868/$File/Eng-Transfemoral.pdf |title=ICRC: Trans-Femoral Prosthesis – Manufacturing Guidelines |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

There is currently an open Prosthetics design forum known as the "Open Prosthetics Project".  The group employs collaborators and volunteers to advance Prosthetics technology while attempting to lower the costs of these necessary devices.<ref>[http://OpenProsthetics.org Open Prosthetics Website]</ref>

A plan for a low-cost artificial leg, designed by Sébastien Dubois, was featured at the 2007 International Design Exhibition and award show in Copenhagen, Denmark, where it won the [[Index: Award]]. It would be able to create an energy-return prosthetic leg for US [[United States dollar|$]]8.00, composed primarily of [[fiberglass]].<ref>[http://www.indexaward.dk/2007/default.asp?id=706&show=nomination&nominationid=163&playmovie=wmv INDEX:2007 INDEX: AWARD]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting one's residual limb to the ground.

The introduction of the [[Seattle Foot]] ([[Seattle Limb Systems]]) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an [[Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot]] (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.

Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability. ''[[Jaipur leg|Jaipur Foot]]'', an artificial limb from [[Jaipur]], [[India]], costs about US$ 40.

==Standardising of Prosthetics in Postmodern Society==
In past literature prothetics have been fetishised from both fiction and non-fiction. In academia concepts of 'the cyborg' and being 'posthuman' have been explored and in some opinion overused <ref>Shoback,Vivian. "The Prosthetic Impulse: from posthuman to a biocultural future" MIT Press, 2006, p. 17.</ref>. Common themes that is found in past non-fiction literature is artificial limb dissociation, where the biological human rejects the artificial parts of themselves <ref>Brozzoli,Claudio. Gentile,Giovanni. Ehrsson, H. Henrik. "Limb Ownership Experience and Peripersonal Space Processing" The Journal of Neuroscience, 17 October 2012, 32(42)p.14573-14582.</ref> and the life of amputees becoming habilitated to artificial limbs to replicate lost function. Whilst in fiction, popular characters such as Jack West of Matthew Reilly's, Seven Ancient Wonders and Doctor Octopus in the Spiderman comic have used prosthetics to gain superhuman powers. 

This fetishism is not completely removed from most societies, however, it has become largely standardised. This is true especially for those born without limbs in comparison to amputees. This has been achieved through advancement in prothetic technology and its ability to further replicate biological human movement and/or it's comestic features. "In past decade greatest advances have occurred in prosthetic technologies, fabrication techniques for sockets and improved components..." Andrew Gitter and Gordon Bosker (co-authors of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation)state <ref>Gitter, Andrew. Bosker, Gordon. "Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation: Principles and Practice" Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005, p.1325</ref>. Indeed there are prosthetics designed specifically for sports and the everyday which suggests an increase in market, awareness of the types of prothetics as well as user understanding. 

Vivian Shoback, author of 'The Prosthetic Impulse', has commented that,“Not only do I see myself as fully human… but I also know intimately my prosthetic leg’s essential inertia and lack of motivating volition. Indeed for all the weight I put on it, it does not run my life."<ref>Shoback,Vivian. "The Prosthetic Impulse: from posthuman to a biocultural future" MIT Press, 2006, p. 17-18.</ref>

In the postmodern society prosthetics are becoming more and more standardised as technology improves and as people are becoming more exposed to the real expectations of prothestics, as well as human self-biographies and what their "relationship" to their prothetic is.

==Reception of Prosthesis/Augmentation==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
In Fiction:
*''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' takes place in a society in which human augmentation begins to enter the mainstream.  This development leads to a divide between those who support human augmentation and those who oppose it.  The main character, Adam Jensen, undergoes extensive augmentation in order to save his life. 
*''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]''’s society becomes one in which the technologies created by Andrew, a machine attempting to become human, are accepted and used to prolong the lifespan of mankind.<ref>{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories|year=1976|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=0-385-12198-9}}</ref>

In Non-Fiction/the Real World
*Outfitted with a prosthetic leg and arm at the age of fourteen, Patrick Kane, a teenager who lost his left arm and right leg to disease while nine months old, develops an understanding of people’s reaction to his new limbs.  He shares that people are always quite positive about his arm and there are times people don’t notice, but it stands out because of its color and the sounds it makes.  His claims that his prosthetic arm will never look completely real and asks why bother trying because it just seems to “hatch people out”.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lever|first=Anna-Marie|title=Day in the life with my bionic body|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17251690|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=March 8, 2012}}</ref>  Kane’s expression is an understanding that, because the prosthetic will never look completely real, it will only serve to frighten people.  This uncanny feeling is created by the prosthetic as it reaches a threshold in which it begins to look human but without looking completely human it will only serve to be a reminder of how human it isn’t.  Sigmund Freud would describe this fear as the uncanny, which stems from what is not known but familiar.<ref>{{cite book|last=Masri|first=Heather|title=Science Fiction: Stories and Contexts|year=2009|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|isbn=0-312-45015-x|pages=427–442|author=Sigmund Freud|authorlink=The Uncanny}}</ref> 
*Two years ago, two individuals made history by being the first people to willingly amputate their limbs in order to get prosthetics.
