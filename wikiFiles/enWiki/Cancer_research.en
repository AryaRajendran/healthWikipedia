'''Cancer research''' is [[basic research]] into [[cancer]] in order to identify causes and develop strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatments and cure.

Cancer research ranges from epidemiology, molecular bioscience to the performance of [[clinical trial]]s to evaluate and compare applications of the various cancer treatment. These applications include [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], [[hormone therapy]], [[Immunotherapy]] and combined treatment modalities such as chemo-radiotherapy. Starting in the mid-1990s, the emphasis in clinical cancer research shifted towards therapies derived from [[biotechnology]] research, such as [[immunotherapy]] and [[gene therapy]].

== Areas of research ==
=== Cause ===

This type of research involves many different disciplines including genetics, diet, environmental factors (i.e. chemical [[carcinogens]]).  In regard to investigation of causes and potential targets for therapy, the route used starts with data obtained from clinical observations, enters basic research, and, once convincing and independently confirmed results are obtained, proceeds with clinical research, involving appropriately designed trials on consenting human subjects, with aim to test safety and efficiency of the therapeutic intervention method.
Important part of basic research is characterization of the potential function of mechanisms of carcinogenesis, in regard to the types of genetic and epigenetic changes that are associated with cancer development. The mouse is often used as a mammalian model for manipulation of the function of genes that play a role in tumor formation, while basic aspects of tumor initiation, such as mutagenesis, are assayed on cultures of bacteria and mammalian cells.

=== Important cell types involved in cancer growth ===

There are several different cell types that are critical to tumor growth. In particular Endothelial Progenitor Cells are a very important cell population in tumor blood vessel growth. This finding was demonstrated in the high impact factor journals of Science (2008) and Genes and Development (2007)which also showed that Endothelial Progenitor Cells are critical for metastasis and the angiogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gao D et al.| title = Endothelial Progenitor Cells Control the Angiogenic Switch in Mouse Lung Metastasis| journal = Science | volume = 319 | pages = 195–198 | year = 2008| doi = 10.1126/science.1150224 | pmid = 18187653 | issue = 5860 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Nolan DJ et al.| title = Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are a major determinant of nascent tumor neovascularization| journal = Genes & Development | volume = 21 | pages = 1546–1558 | year = 2007| doi = 10.1101/gad.436307 | pmid = 17575055 | issue = 12 | pmc = 1891431  }}</ref> This importance of endothelial progenitor cells in tumour growth and angiogenesis has been confirmed by a recent publication in Cancer Research (August 2010). This seminal paper has demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells can be marked using the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1). This novel finding meant that investigators were able to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood  to the tumour-stroma and even incorporated in tumour vasculature. This finding of endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumour vasculature proves the importance of this cell type in blood vessel development in a tumour setting. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow lead to a significant decrease in tumour growth and vasculature development. Therefore endothelial progenitor cells are very important in tumour biology and present novel therapeutic targets.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mellick As, Plummer PN et al.| title = Using the Transcription Factor Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 to Selectively Target Endothelial Progenitor Cells Offers Novel Strategies to Inhibit Tumor Angiogenesis and Growth| journal = Cancer Research | volume = 70 | pages = 7273–7282 | year = 2010| doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1142 | pmid = 20807818 | issue = 18 | pmc = 3058751 }}</ref>

==== ''In Vitro'' Research Using Cell Lines ====
''[[In vitro]]'' assays allow scientists to conduct studies under reasonable conditions in the lab.  In order to study the communication between a tumor cell and a host cell ''[[in vitro]]'' assays have been created.  The use of fragmented chicken heart cells as a host case for nutrients<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gabber|title=Mechanisms of  tumor invasion: evidence from  in  vivo observations.  Cancer Metastasis|year=1985|volume=4|pages=293–309|doi=10.1007/BF00048094}}</ref> Thus allowing the HeLa cells to, in a sense win, and over take the PHF. In the case of the L tumor cells, they were not able to invade the PHF. Though HeLa cells were able to accomplish invasion after several hours the L cells are structurally different rendering them inadequate. The L cells have much more intercellular free space and do not surround the host cell as tightly as Hela cells. It was concluded that with a tight gap junction nutrients cannot enter the cell allowing the cancer cells to invade. With this information about the gap junction process between host cell and the tumor cell, further studies were conducted in cancer gene therapy with the use of Hela cells and the [[herpes]] virus.<ref name=Mesnil>{{cite journal|last=Mesnil|first=M.|coauthors=Piccoli, C.Tiraby, G.,Willencke K., Yamasaki,H.|title=Bystander killing of cancer cells by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene is mediated by connexins|journal=Medical Sciences|year=1996|month=March|volume=93|pages=1831–1835|accessdate=6 April 2012|pmc=39867|pmid=8700844|issue=5}}</ref>

==== Oncogenomics/Genes involved in cancer ====
{{main|Oncogenomics}}

{{See also|Databases for oncogenomic research}}

The goal of [[oncogenomics]] is to identify new [[oncogenes]] or [[tumor suppressor genes]] that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis, predicting clinical outcome of cancers, and new targets for cancer therapies. As the [[Cancer Genome Project]] stated in a 2004 review article, "a central aim of cancer research has been to identify the mutated genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis (''cancer genes'')."<ref name="pmid14993899">{{cite journal | author = Futreal PA, Coin L, Marshall M, Down T, Hubbard T, Wooster R, Rahman N, Stratton MR | title = A census of human cancer genes | journal = Nat. Rev. Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–83 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14993899 | doi = 10.1038/nrc1299 | pmc = 2665285 }}</ref> [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] project is a related effort investigating the genomic changes associated with cancer, while the [[COSMIC cancer database]] documents acquired genetic [[mutation]]s from hundreds of thousands of human cancer samples.<ref name="pmid16421597">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602928 |author=Forbes S, Clements J, Dawson E, Bamford S, Webb T, Dogan A, Flanagan A, Teague J, Wooster R, Futreal PA, Stratton MR |title=COSMIC 2005 |journal=Br J Cancer |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=318–22 |year=2006 |pmid=16421597 |pmc=2361125}}</ref>

These large scale projects, involving about 350 different types of tumour, have identified ~130,000 [[mutation]]s in ~3000 [[genes]] that have been mutated in the tumours. The majority occurred in 319 genes of which 286 were [[tumour supressor gene]]s and 33 [[oncogene]]s.

Several hereditary factors can increase the chance of cancer-causing mutations, including the activation of [[oncogene]]s or the inhibition of  [[tumor suppressor gene]]s. The functions of various onco- and tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted at different stages of tumor progression. Mutations in such genes can be used to classify the malignancy of a tumor. <!-- What does this last sentence mean?/! -->

In later stages, tumors can develop a resistance to cancer treatment. The identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is important to understand tumor progression and treatment success. The role of a given gene in cancer progression may vary tremendously, depending on the stage and type of cancer involved.<ref>Vlahopoulos SA, Logotheti S, Mikas D, Giarika A, Gorgoulis V, Zoumpourlis V.The role of ATF-2 in oncogenesis.Bioessays. 2008 Apr;30(4):314-27.</ref>

== Issues ==

[[Newsweek]] magazine published an article criticising the use of lab rats on cancer research because even though researchers frequently manage to cure lab mice transplanted with human [[tumor]]s, few of those achievements are relevant to humanity.<ref name="newsweek.com">http://www.newsweek.com/id/157548/page/3</ref> Oncologist [[Paul Bunn]], from the [[International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer]]<ref>http://www.uchsc.edu/news/bridge/2003/October/bunnaslc.html</ref> said: "''We put a human tumor under the mouse's skin, and that microenvironment doesn't reflect a person's—the blood vessels, inflammatory cells or cells of the immune system''".<ref name="newsweek.com"/>  [[Fran Visco]] founder of the [[National Breast Cancer Coalition]] completed: "''We cure cancer in animals all the time, but not in people.''"<ref name="newsweek.com"/>

=== Funding ===
Most funding for cancer research comes from taxpayers and charities, rather than from profit-making businesses.  In the US, less than 30% of all cancer research is funded by commercial researchers such as pharmaceutical companies.<ref name=pmid16842021>{{cite pmid|16842021}}</ref>

Per capita, public spending on cancer research by taxpayers and charities in the US is seven times as much as public spending by taxpayers and charities in the European Union.<ref name=pmid16842021 />  As a percentage of GDP, the non-commercial funding of cancer research in the US is four times the amount dedicated to cancer research in Europe.<ref name=pmid16842021 />  Half of Europe's non-commercial cancer research is funded by charitable organizations.<ref name=pmid16842021 />

Some substances, like [[dichloroacetate]] (DCA)<ref name="newscientist">{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn10971 |title=Cheap, 'safe' drug kills most cancers |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2012-02-27 |publisher=New Scientist}}</ref> cannot be patented and thus would not garner the investment interest towards research from the pharmaceutical industry, though in the case of DCA it would be cheap and easy to manufacture.

=== Innovation ===

The organizational behavior of the large institutions and corporations that research cancer, may unduly favor low-risk research into small incremental advancements, over innovative research that might discover radically new and dramatically improved therapy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/health/policy/24cancer.html|title=Advances Elusive in the Drive to Cure Cancer |last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=April 23, 2009 |publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/health/research/28cancer.html|title=Grant System Leads Cancer Researchers to Play It Safe |last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=June 27, 2009 |publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>
