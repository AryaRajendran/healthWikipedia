==Work==
Conrad Brunner conducted and published clinical, bacteriological and experimental studies on the effectiveness of various contemporary wound disinfection methods. He was able to prove that his method, namely the ''Brunner's Jodalkoholdesinfektion'', offered by far the best guarantee against the occurrence of wound diseases. 

Brunner researched and published on topics in the history of medicine, mostly as related to Switzerland.
