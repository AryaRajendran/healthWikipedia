'''Angiotensin II receptor antagonists''', also known as '''angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)''', '''AT<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists''' or '''sartans''', are a group of pharmaceuticals which modulate the [[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]]. Their main uses are in the treatment of [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), [[diabetic nephropathy]] (kidney damage due to [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]) and [[congestive heart failure]].

==Medical uses==
Angiotensin II receptor blockers are primarily used for the treatment of [[hypertension]] where the patient is intolerant of [[ACE inhibitor]] therapy.  They do not inhibit the breakdown of [[bradykinin]] or other [[kinin]]s, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or [[angioedema]] that limit ACE inhibitor therapy{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.  More recently, they have been used for the treatment of [[heart failure]] in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy, particularly [[candesartan]]. Irbesartan and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, and may delay the progression of [[diabetic nephropathy]]. [[Candesartan]] is used experimentally in preventive treatment of migraine.<ref name="Tronvik-Stovner-2003">{{cite journal |author=Tronvik E, Stovner LJ, Helde G, Sand T, Bovim G. |title=Prophylactic treatment of migraine with an angiotensin II receptor blocker: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |year=2003 |volume=1 |issue=289 Pt 1 |pages=65–9 |pmid=12503978 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.1.65 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Differential clinical profile of candesartan compared to other angiotensin receptor blockers |author=Cernes R, Mashavi M, Zimlichman R |journal=Vasc Health Risk Manag |year=2011 |volume=7 |pages=749–59 |pmid=22241949 |pmc=3253768 |doi=10.2147/VHRM.S22591}}</ref> Lisinopril has been found less often effective than candesartan at preventing migraine.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Ann Pharmacother |date=2010 Feb |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=360–6 |title=Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for the prevention of migraines |author=Gales BJ, Bailey EK, Reed AN, Gales MA |pmid=20086184 |doi=10.1345/aph.1M312}}</ref>

In one study after 12 weeks of treatment with an [[ARB]] called [[losartan]] (Cozaar), 88% of hypertensive males with sexual dysfunction reported improvement in at least one area of sexuality. The number of men reporting impotence declined from 75.3% to 11.8%. Other ARBs include [[candesartan]] (Atacand), [[telmisartan]] (Micardis), and [[Valsartan]] (Diovan).<ref>about.com</ref>

Angiotensin II, through AT1 receptor stimulation, is a major stress hormone, and because (ARBs) block these receptors, in addition to their anti-hypertensive effects, may be considered for the treatment of stress-related disorders.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2659765</ref>

In 2008, they were reported to have a remarkable negative association with [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).  A retrospective analysis of five million patient records with the US [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] system found different types of commonly used antihypertensive medications had very different AD outcomes.  Those patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were 35—40% less likely to develop AD than those using other antihypertensives.<ref>

==Discovery and development==
{{details|Discovery and development of angiotensin receptor blockers}}

==Structure==
[[Losartan]], [[irbesartan]], [[olmesartan]], [[candesartan]] and [[valsartan]] include the [[tetrazole]] group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, and [[telmisartan]] include one or two [[imidazole]] groups.

==Mechanism of action==
These substances are AT<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists – that is, they block the activation of [[Angiotensin receptor|angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors]]. Blockage of AT<sub>1</sub> receptors directly causes [[vasodilation]], reduces secretion of [[vasopressin]], and reduces production and secretion of [[aldosterone]], amongst other actions. The combined effect reduces blood pressure.

The specific efficacy of each ARB within this class depends upon a combination of three [[pharmacodynamic]] and [[pharmacokinetic]] parameters. Efficacy requires three key PD/ PK areas at an effective level; the parameters of the three characteristics will need to be compiled into a table similar to one below, eliminating duplications and arriving at consensus values; the latter are at variance now.

===Pressor inhibition===
[[Pressor]] inhibition at [[trough level]] - this relates to the degree of blockade or inhibition of the blood pressure-raising ("pressor") effect of angiotensin II.  However, pressor inhibition is not a measure of blood pressure-lowering (BP) efficacy ''per se''.  The rates as listed in the US FDA Package Inserts (PIs) for inhibition of this effect at the 24th hour for the ARBs are as follows: (all doses listed in PI are included)
*[[Valsartan]] 80&nbsp;mg 30%
*[[Telmisartan]] 80&nbsp;mg 40%
*[[Losartan]] 100&nbsp;mg 25–40%
*[[Irbesartan]] 150&nbsp;mg 40%
*Irbesartan 300&nbsp;mg 60%
*[[Azilsartan]] 32&nbsp;mg 60%
*[[Olmesartan]] 20&nbsp;mg 61%
*Olmesartan 40&nbsp;mg 74%

===AT<sub>1</sub> affinity===
AT<sub>1</sub> affinity vs AT<sub>2</sub> is not a meaningful efficacy measurement of BP response. 
The specific AT<sub>1</sub> affinity relates to how specifically attracted the medicine is for the correct receptor, the US FDA PI rates for AT<sub>1</sub> affinity are as follows:
*[[Losartan]] 1000 fold
*[[Telmisartan]] 3000 fold
*[[Irbesartan]] 8500 fold
*[[Azilsartan]] greater than 10000 fold
*[[Olmesartan]] 12500 fold
*[[Valsartan]] 20000 fold

===Biological half-life===
The third area needed to complete the overall efficacy picture of an ARB is its [[biological half-life]]. The half-lives from the US FDA PIs are as follows:
*[[Valsartan]] 6 hours
*[[Losartan]] 6–9 hours
*[[Azilsartan]] 11 hours
*[[Irbesartan]] 11–15 hours
*[[Olmesartan]] 13 hours
*[[Telmisartan]] 24 hours

==Adverse effects==
This class of drugs is usually well tolerated. Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) include: dizziness, headache, and/or [[hyperkalemia]]. Infrequent ADRs associated with therapy include: first dose [[orthostatic hypotension]], rash, diarrhea, [[dyspepsia]], abnormal liver function, muscle cramp, [[myalgia]], back pain, [[insomnia]], decreased [[hemoglobin]] levels, [[renal impairment]], [[pharyngitis]], and/or nasal congestion.<ref name="Rossi">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006.</ref>

While one of the main rationales for the use of this class is the avoidance of dry cough and/or angioedema associated with ACE inhibitor therapy, rarely they may still occur. Additionally, there is also a small risk of cross-reactivity in patients who have experienced [[angioedema]] with ACE inhibitor therapy.<ref name="Rossi"/>

===Myocardial infarction: the controversy===
The issue of whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists slightly increase the risk of [[myocardial infarction]] (MI or heart attack) is currently being investigated. Some studies suggest ARBs can increase the risk of MI.<ref name="pmid16923768">{{cite journal |author=Strauss MH, Hall AS |title=Angiotensin receptor blockers may increase risk of myocardial infarction: unraveling the ARB-MI paradox |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=838–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16923768 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.594986}}</ref> However, other studies have found ARBs do not increase the risk of MI.<ref name="pmid16923769">{{cite journal |author=Tsuyuki RT, McDonald MA |title=Angiotensin receptor blockers do not increase risk of myocardial infarction |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=855–60 |year=2006 |pmid=16923769 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.594978}}</ref> To date, with no consensus on whether ARBs have a tendency to increase the risk of myocardial infarction, further investigations are underway. 

Indeed, as a consequence of AT<sub>1</sub> blockade, ARBs increase angiotensin II levels several-fold above baseline by uncoupling a [[negative-feedback]] loop. Increased levels of circulating angiotensin II result in unopposed stimulation of the AT<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are, in addition, upregulated. Unfortunately, recent data suggest AT<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation may be less beneficial than previously proposed, and may even be harmful under certain circumstances through mediation of growth promotion, [[fibrosis]], and [[hypertrophy]], as well as [[atherogenesis|proatherogenic]] and [[proinflammatory]] effects.<ref name="pmid16125050">{{cite journal |author=Levy BI |title=How to explain the differences between renin angiotensin system modulators |journal=Am.

===Cancer risk factors===
A study published in 2010 determined that "...meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials suggests that ARBs are associated with a modestly increased risk of new cancer diagnosis.

==Longevity promotion==
Knockout of the Agtr1a gene that encodes AT<sub>1</sub> results in marked prolongation of the life span of mice by 26% compared to controls.  The likely mechanism is reduction of oxidative damage ( especially to mitochondria ) and overexpression of renal prosurvival genes.   The ARBs seem to have the same effect.<ref name="pmid19197138">{{cite journal |author=Benigni A, Corna D, Zoja C, Sonzogni A, Latini R, Salio M, Conti S, Rottoli D, Longaretti L, Cassis P, Morigi M, Coffman T, Remuzzi G |title=Disruption of the Ang II type 1 receptor promotes longevity in mice |journal=J.
