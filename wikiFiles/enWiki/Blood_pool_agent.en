'''Blood pool agents''' (BPAs) are a class of [[magnetic resonance angiography]] [[contrast agents]].<ref name="bloodpoolagents.us">[http://www.bloodpoolagents.us/ Blood Pool Agents]</ref> Blood pool agents (also known as intravascular contrast agents) are differentiated from other contrast agents due to their high molecular weight and higher [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxivities]].<ref name="Geraldes 4:1-23">Geraldes CF, Laurent S, Classification and basic properties of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, Contrast Media Mol Imaging, 2009;4:1-23.</ref> Their large size prevents diffusion through the [[vascular]] [[epithelium]] and leakage into the [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstitial space]], and because of this they stay in the vascular system for a longer time period. Most contrast agents, leave the vascular system within a few minutes, however blood pool agents remain in the circulation for up to an hour, extending the window available for imaging. Longer image acquisition times allow better [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and improved image resolution.

== Roles of blood pool agents ==
Due to their extended time in the [[circulatory system]], blood pool agents can be used for delayed steady-state imaging, and additionally these results can be combined with first pass arterial imaging.<ref name="bloodpoolagents.us"/><ref name="Geraldes 4:1-23"/> Their extended circulation time means that they are able to be used for both [[arterial]] and [[venous]] mapping. Additional uses include: detection of [[gastrointestinal bleeding]]; visualization of the vasculature associated with certain tumors; measuring tissue blood volume and perfusion; and detection of endovascular leaks (such as following [[stent-graft]] repair of an [[aortic aneurysm]]).

== Classes of blood pool agents ==
=== Albumin-binding gadolinium complexes ===
This class of BPAs is based on the noncovalent binding of low molecular weight Gd<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>-based complexes to [[human serum albumin]]. The first commercial agent to be approved in this class is [[gadofosveset trisodium]]<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm238185.htm Ablavar (gadofosveset trisodium) injection]</ref> (also known as Vasovist®<ref>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=8966 VASOVIST (gadofosveset trisodium)]</ref> or Ablavar®,<ref>[http://www.ablavar.com/home.html Ablavar®]</ref> and previously known as MS-325<ref>[http://www.mr-tip.com/serv1.php?type=db1&dbs=MS-325 MS-325. Magnetic Resonance - Technology Information Portal]</ref>). Many clinical and case studies documenting the use of this BPA have been published,<ref>Wolf F, Plank C, Beitzke D, et al., Prospective evaluation of high-resolution MRI using gadofosveset for stent-graft planning: comparison with CT angiography in 30 patients, AJR Am J Roentgenol, 2011;197:1251-7</ref><ref>Partovi S, Aschwanden M, Staub D, et al., Gadofosveset enhanced MR phlebography for detecting pelvic and deep vein leg thrombosis, Vasa, 2011;40:315-9</ref><ref>Haneder S, Attenberger UI, Biffar A, et al., Gadofosveset: parameter optimization for steady-state imaging of the thoracic and abdominal vasculature, Invest Radiol, 2011;46:678-85</ref><ref>Pfeil A, Betge S, Poehlmann G, et al., Magnetic resonance VIBE venography using the blood pool contrast agent gadofosveset trisodium-An interrater reliability study, Eur J Radiol, 2011;81:547-52</ref><ref>Pedersen SF, Thrysoe SA, Paaske WP, et al., CMR assessment of endothelial damage and angiogenesis in porcine coronary arteries using gadofosveset, J Cardiovasc Magn Reson, 2011;13:10</ref><ref>Yamashita T, Takahara T, Kwee TC, et al., Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging with gadofosveset trisodium as a negative contrast agent for lymph node metastases assessment, Jpn J Radiol, 2011;29:25-32</ref><ref>Lambregts DM, Beets GL, Maas M, et al., Accuracy of gadofosveset-enhanced MRI for nodal staging and restaging in rectal cancer, Ann Surg, 2011;253:539-45</ref> and its efficacy in enhancing blood vessels visibility has been demonstrated.<ref>McGregor R, Vymazal J, Martinez-Lopez M, et al., A multi-center, comparative, phase 3 study to determine the efficacy of gadofosveset-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography for evaluation of renal artery disease, Eur J Radiol, 2008;65:316-25</ref>  

Gadocoletic acid<ref>[http://www.bloodpoolagents.us/categories/blood-pool-imaging/investigational-agents/gadocoletic-acid Gadocoletic acid]</ref> (Bracco SpA), also known as B-22956 and B22956/1, is a Gd-DTPA derivative that is currently in development, but has not yet been approved for clinical use. 

[[Gadobenic acid]] (MultiHance®<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/drugs/cardiovascularandrenaldrugsadvisorycommittee/ucm196225.pdf MultiHance®]</ref>) is sometimes categorized as a BPA; however, as it only binds weakly to albumin and because hepatobiliary uptake of this compound occurs, this contrast agent should not be classified as a BPA.

=== Polymeric gadolinium complexes ===
Polymeric Gd<sup>3+</sup> chelates are large in size, which prevents leakage into the interstitial space, and provides long imaging windows. Several polymeric gadolinium-based BPAs are currently in development but have not yet been approved for clinical use:
Gadomelitol<ref>[http://www.bloodpoolagents.us/categories/blood-pool-imaging/investigational-agents/gadomelitol Gadomelitol]</ref> (Guerbet, France), also known as Vistarem® and P792 
Gadomer-17<ref>[http://www.bloodpoolagents.us/categories/blood-pool-imaging/investigational-agents/gadomer-17 Gadomer-17]</ref> (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) also known as Gd-DTPA-17, SH L 643 A.
