'''Uterine adenosarcoma''', also '''adenosarcoma of the uterus''', and '''Müllerian adenosarcoma of the uterus''', is an uncommon form of [[cancer]] that arises from [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]] tissue of the [[uterus]] and has a [[benign]] [[gland]]ular component.

==Presentation==
The most common presentation is [[vaginal bleeding]].<ref name=pmid9625851>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Verschraegen | first1 = CF. | last2 = Vasuratna | first2 = A. | last3 = Edwards | first3 = C. | last4 = Freedman | first4 = R. | last5 = Kudelka | first5 = AP. | last6 = Tornos | first6 = C. | last7 = Kavanagh | first7 = JJ. | title = Clinicopathologic analysis of mullerian adenosarcoma: the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center experience. | journal = Oncol Rep | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 939–44 | month =  | year =  | doi =  | PMID = 9625851 }}</ref> Other presentations include [[pelvis|pelvic]] mass and [[uterine polyp]]. Generally, the clinical findings are non-specific.

==Pathology==
Uterine adenosarcoma have, by definition, a malignant [[stroma]] and benign glandular elements. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] criteria has a mitotic rate cut point; however, this is often disregarded, as bland appearing tumours with a low [[mitoses|mitotic]] rate are known to [[metastasize]] occasionally.<ref name=pmid20179434>{{Cite journal  | last1 = McCluggage | first1 = WG. | title = Mullerian adenosarcoma of the female genital tract. | journal = Adv Anat Pathol | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–9 | month = Mar | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181cfe732 | PMID = 20179434 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Uterine adenosarcomas are typically treated with a [[total abdominal hysterectomy]] and bilateral [[salpingoophorectomy]] (TAH-BSO).  [[Ovary]] sparing surgery may be done in women wishing to preserve [[fertility]].<ref name=pmid21319526>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Adedipe | first1 = TO. | last2 = Vine | first2 = SJ. | title = Mullerian adenosarcoma of the uterus: a rare neoplasm with a need for onco-fertility. | journal = Eur J Gynaecol Oncol | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 714–6 | month =  | year = 2010 | doi =  | PMID = 21319526 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is determined primarily by the [[cancer stage]]. Most tumours are discovered at an early stage and have a good prognosis, especially when compared to [[uterine carcinosarcoma]]. Five year survival for stage I and stage III tumours is approximately 80% and 50% respectively.<ref name=pmid20688363>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arend | first1 = R. | last2 = Bagaria | first2 = M. | last3 = Lewin | first3 = SN. | last4 = Sun | first4 = X. | last5 = Deutsch | first5 = I. | last6 = Burke | first6 = WM. | last7 = Herzog | first7 = TJ. | last8 = Wright | first8 = JD. | title = Long-term outcome and natural history of uterine adenosarcomas. | journal = Gynecol Oncol | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 305–8 | month = Nov | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygyno.2010.07.001 | PMID = 20688363 }}</ref>
