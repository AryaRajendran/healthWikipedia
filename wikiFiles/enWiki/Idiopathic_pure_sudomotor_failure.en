'''Idiopathic pure sudomotor failure''' (IPSF) is the most common cause of a rare disorder know as acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) a clinical syndrome characterized by generalized decrease or absence of sweating without other autonomic and somatic nervous dysfunctions and without persistent organic cutaneous lesions.<ref name="DICT">{{Cite pmid|15505168|noedit}}</ref>

The term IPSF was first introduced in 1994 after researchers at [[Saitama Medical School]], Japan speculated that the primary lesion sites in patients were within cholinergic receptors of the sweat glands. The term IPSF represent a distinct subgroup of AIGA without sudomotor [[neuropathy]] or sweat gland failure.<ref name="IPSF94">{{Cite pmid|8156704|noedit}}</ref>



==Clinical features== 

* Early onset in life
* Acute or sudden onset 
* Concomitant sharp pain or [[cholinergic urticaria]] over the entire body
* Absence of other [[autonomic dysfunction]]
* Elevated serum [[IgE]] levels
* Marked response to [[glucocorticoids]]<ref name="DICT" />


==Epidemiology==

The overwhelming majority of reported AIGA patients are Japanese, but whether AIGA is truly rare in whites or has been simply underreported by Western physicians remains unclear.

AIGA is most prevalent among young men. In a 64 case review of the liturature 58 reported cases were males and 6 female, with a mean age of onset at 28 Â± 11 years. Cholinergic urticaria or sharp pain over the entire body induced by elevated body temperature was reported in 32 cases (50%). Of 28 cases tested, 12 (43%) displayed elevated serum IgE levels. [[Skin biopsy]] was performed in 53 cases, with normal findings in 20 cases (38%), and cellular infiltrates in sweat glands or ducts in 23 cases (43%).<ref name="DICT" />


==Pathology==

Intracutaneous injection of [[pilocarpine]] (direct stimulant of sweat glands) is know to evoke no sweat response, indicating that lesions in are on the post-synaptic side of the nerve-sweat gland junction. Similar findings also suggest that both sudomotor nerve fibers and sweat glands remain intact.<ref name="DICT" />

The proposed pathomechanisms of idiopathic pure sudomotor failure include;

* A deficit/dysfunction within muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the [[eccrine sweat glands]].<ref name="DICT" /><ref name="QSART">{{Cite pmid|16362546|noedit}}</ref>
* Interference in [[acetylcholine]] transmission to cholinergic receptors.<ref name="DICT" />
* A cross-reactive immune response that interferes with cholinergic transmission in the eccrine glands of skin.<ref name="FIM">{{Cite pmid|22924754|noedit}}</ref>
* Components of an immediate-type allergy (based on the dramatic resumption of axon reflex sweating following glucocorticoid treatment).<ref name="QSART"/>



==Management==

Novel treatments for AIGA are required as current treatment of AIGA almost always comprises steroid pulse therapy or high-dose oral steroids. 

Treatment for AIGA is not consistently effective, and much remains unclear regarding the reasons for recurrent anhidrosis. The efficacy of steroid treatment and recurrence of anhidrosis are confirmed using the [[minor test]].<ref name="TAIGA">{{Cite pmid|22709381|noedit}}</ref>
