'''Scleritis''' is a serious [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[disease]] that affects the white outer coating of the [[human eye|eye]], known as the [[sclera]]. The disease is often contracted through association with other diseases of the body, such as [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]; it can also be attained through disorders of [[menstruation]]. For this reason, scleritis occurs frequently among young women. There are three types of scleritis: diffuse scleritis (the most common), nodular scleritis, and necrotizing scleritis (the most severe). Scleritis may be the first symptom of onset of [[connective tissue disease]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Scleritis|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1228324-overview|work=WebMD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> 

[[Episcleritis]] is inflammation of the [[episclera]], a less serious condition that seldom develops into scleritis.<ref name=Medline>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001019.htm|title=Episcleritis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]|accessdate=20 June 2010|location=Bethesda, MD}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of scleritis include:<ref name=PubMedHealth>{{Cite web|last=Vorvick |first=Linda J.|title=Scleritis |work=PubMed Health |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=July 28, 2010 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001998/  |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>
*Redness of the sclera and [[conjunctiva]], sometimes changing to a [[purple]] hue
*Severe ocular pain, which may radiate to the temple or jaw.  The pain is often described as deep or boring.
*[[Photophobia]] and [[Tears|tearing]]
*Decrease in [[visual acuity]], possibly leading to [[blindness]]

The pain of episcleritis is less severe than in scleritis.<ref name=Cecil />  In hyperemia, there is a visible increases in the blood flow to the sclera ([[hyperaemia]]), which accounts for the redness of the eye.  Unlike in conjunctivitis, this redness will not move with gentle pressure to the conjunctiva.
==Pathophysiology==
Most of the time, scleritis is not caused by an infectious agent.<ref name=Yanoff>{{cite book|last=Yanoff|first=Myron|coauthor=Jay S. Duker|title=Ophthalmology|year=2008|publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0323057516|pages=255–261|edition=3rd}}</ref>Histopathological changes are that of a chronic granulomatous disorder, characterized by fibrinoid [[necrosis]], infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells, [[lymphocytes]], [[plasma cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s. The [[granuloma]]is surrounded by multinucleated epitheloid giant cells and  new vessels, some of which may show evidence of[[vasculitis]].
== Diagnosis ==
Scleritis is best detected by examining the sclera in daylight; retracting the lids helps determine the extent of involvement.  Other aspects of the eye exam (i.e. visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, etc.) may be normal.  Scleritis may be differentiated from episcleritis by using [[phenylephrine]] or [[neosynephrine]] eye drops, which causes blanching of the blood vessels in episcleritis, but not in scleritis.<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|year=2011|pages=2440|edition=24th}}</ref>

Ancillary tests [[computed tomography|CT scan]]s, [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]s, and [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasonographies]] can be helpful, but do not replace the physical examination.

== Treatment ==
In very severe cases of necrotizing scleritis, eye [[surgery]] must be performed to repair damaged [[cornea]]l [[biological tissue|tissue]] in the eye and preserve the patient's vision. For less severe cases, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as [[ibuprofen]], are prescribed for pain relief. Scleritis itself is treated with an oral medication containing [[corticosteroids]] and an eye solution. In some cases, [[antibiotics]] are prescribed. Simply using [[eye drops]] will not treat scleritis. In more aggressive cases of scleritis, chemotherapy (such as systemic immunosuppressive therapy with such drugs as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine) may be used to treat the disease.  If not treated, scleritis can cause [[blindness]].

==Complications==
Secondary keratitis or uveitis may occur with scleritis.<ref name=Cecil />  Although rare, scleritis may progress to episcleritis.<ref name=Medline />  The most severe complications are associated with necrotizing scleritis.

==Epidemiology==
Scleritis is not a common disease, although the exact prevalence and incidence are unknown.  It is somewhat more common in women, and is most common in people 30–60 years age.
