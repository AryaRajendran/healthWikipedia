In [[nephrology]], '''dialysis disequilibrium [[syndrome]]''', commonly [[abbreviated]] '''DDS''', is the occurrence of neurologic [[sign (medicine)|sign]]s and [[symptom]]s, attributed to [[cerebral edema]], during or following shortly after intermittent [[hemodialysis]].<ref name=bagshaw>{{cite journal |author=Bagshaw SM, Peets AD, Hameed M, Boiteau PJ, Laupland KB, Doig CJ |title=Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome: Brain death following hemodialysis for metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure – A case report |journal=BMC Nephrol |volume=5|pages=9 |year=2004 |pmid=15318947 |doi=10.1186/1471-2369-5-9 |pmc=515303}} [http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2369-5-9.pdf Free Full Text].</ref>

Classically, DDS arises in individuals starting hemodialysis due to [[chronic renal failure]] and is associated, in particular, with "aggressive" (high solute removal) dialysis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Port FK, Johnson WJ, Klass DW |title=Prevention of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome by use of high sodium concentration in the dialysate |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=327–33 |year=1973 |pmid=4792047 |doi=10.1038/ki.1973.51}} [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1026951 Free Full Text].</ref>   However, it may also arise in fast onset, i.e. [[acute renal failure|acute, renal failure]] in certain conditions.

==Etiology==
The cause of DDS is currently not well understood. 

There are two [[theory|theories]] to explain it; the first theory postulates that [[urea]] transport from the [[brain]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s is slowed in chronic renal failure, leading to a large urea [[concentration gradient]], which resulting in [[reverse osmosis]].  The second theory postulates that [[organic compound]]s are increased in [[uremia]] to protect the brain and result in injury by, like in the first theory, reverse [[osmosis]].<ref name=bagshaw/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Clinical sign]]s of cerebral edema, such as [[focal neurological deficit]]s, [[papilledema]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Im L, Atabay C, Eller AW |title=Papilledema associated with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome |journal=Semin Ophthalmol |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=133–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17763231 |doi=10.1080/08820530701421585}}</ref> and decreased level of [[consciousness]], if temporally associated with recent hemodialysis, suggest the diagnosis.  A [[computed tomography]] of the head is typically done to rule-out other intracranial causes.

[[MRI]] of the head has been used in research to better understand DDS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen CL, Lai PH, Chou KJ, Lee PT, Chung HM, Fang HC |title=A preliminary report of brain edema in patients with uremia at first hemodialysis: evaluation by diffusion-weighted MR imaging |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=68–71 |year=2007 |pmid=17213426 |doi=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Avoidance is the primary treatment.
 
DDS is a reason why hemodialysis initiation is usually done gradually, i.e. it is a reason the first few dialysis sessions are shorter than is typical in an [[end-stage renal disease]] patient.
