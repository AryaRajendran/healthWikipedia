'''Primary immunodeficiencies''' are disorders in which part of the body's [[immune system]] is missing or does not function properly. To be considered a ''primary'' [[immunodeficiency]], the cause of the immune deficiency must not be secondary in nature (i.e., caused by other disease, drug treatment, or environmental exposure to toxins). Most primary immunodeficiencies are [[genetic disorder]]s; the majority are diagnosed in [[child]]ren under the age of one, although milder forms may not be recognized until adulthood. About 1 in 500 people is born with a primary immunodeficiency.<ref name=Lim2004>{{cite journal |author=Lim MS, Elenitoba-Johnson KS |title=The Molecular Pathology of Primary Immunodeficiencies |journal=The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=59–83 |year=2004 |pmid=15096561 |doi= 10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60493-X|pmc=1867474}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The precise symptoms of a primary immunodeficiency depend on the type of defect. Generally, the symptoms and signs that lead to the diagnosis of an immunodeficiency include recurrent or persistent [[infection]]s or [[Developmental disability|developmental delay]] as a result of infection. Particular organ problems (e.g. diseases involving the [[skin]], [[heart]], facial development and skeletal system) may be present in certain conditions. Others predispose to [[autoimmune disease]], where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, or tumours (sometimes specific forms of [[cancer]], such as [[lymphoma]]). The nature of the infections, as well as the additional features, may provide clues as to the exact nature of the immune defect.<ref name=Lim2004/>

==Diagnosis==
The basic tests performed when an immunodeficiency is suspected should include a [[full blood count]] (including accurate [[lymphocyte]] and [[granulocyte]] counts) and [[immunoglobulin]] levels (the three most important types of antibodies: [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]], [[immunoglobulin A|IgA]] and [[immunoglobulin M|IgM]]).<ref name=Lim2004/>

Other tests are performed depending on the suspected disorder:<ref name=Lim2004/>
* Quantification of the different types of mononuclear cells in the blood (i.e. lymphocytes and [[monocyte]]s): different groups of [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] (dependent on their cell surface markers, e.g. [[CD4|CD4+]], [[CD8|CD8+]], [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3+]], TCRαβ and [[Gamma/delta T cells|TCRγδ]]), groups of [[B cell|B lymphocytes]] (CD19, CD20, CD21 and Immunoglobulin), [[natural killer cell]]s and monocytes (CD15+), as well as activation markers ([[HLA-DR]], [[CD25]], [[CD80]] (B cells).
* Tests for T cell function: skin tests for [[Cell-mediated immunity|delayed-type hypersensitivity]], cell responses to [[mitogen]]s and allogeneic cells, [[cytokine]] production by cells
* Tests for B cell function: antibodies to routine immunisations and commonly acquired infections, quantification of [[Immunoglobulin G1|IgG subclasses]]
* Tests for [[phagocyte]] function: reduction of [[nitro blue tetrazolium chloride]], assays of [[chemotaxis]], bactericidal activity.

Due to the rarity of many primary immunodeficiencies, many of the above tests are highly specialised and tend to be performed in research laboratories.<ref name=Lim2004/>

Criteria for diagnosis were agreed in 1999. For instance, an antibody deficiency can be diagnosed in the presence of low immunoglobulins, recurrent infections and failure of the development of antibodies on exposure to antigens. The 1999 criteria also distinguish between "definitive", "probable" and "possible" in the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency. "Definitive" diagnosis is made when it is likely that in 20 years, the patient has a >98% chance of the same diagnosis being made; this level of diagnosis is achievable with the detection of a genetic mutation or very specific circumstantial abnormalities. "Probable" diagnosis is made when no genetic diagnosis can be made, but the patient has all other characteristics of a particular disease; the chance of the same diagnosis being made 20 years later is estimated to be 85-97%. Finally, a "possible" diagnosis is made when the patient has only some of the characteristics of a disease are present, but not all.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conley ME, Notarangelo LD, Etzioni A |title=Diagnostic criteria for primary immunodeficiencies.

===Table I: Combined T and B–cell immunodeﬁciencies===
[[File:Genetic_Immunodeficiencies.svg|thumb|450px|Genetic immunodeficiencies. (In general, those on the left are in Table I, while those on the right are in Table II, but there are exceptions.)]]
In these disorders both [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] and often [[B cell|B lymphocytes]], regulators of adaptive immunity, are dysfunctional or decreased in number. The main members are various types of [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID).<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# T-/B+ SCID (T cells predominantly absent): [[Severe combined immunodeficiency#Common gamma chain (X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency)|γc deficiency]], [[Severe combined immunodeficiency#JAK3|JAK3 deficiency]], [[interleukin 7]] receptor chain α deficiency, [[CD45]] deficiency, [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3δ/CD3ε]] deficiency.

# [[Omenn syndrome]]
# [[DNA ligase]] type IV deficiency
# [[Cernunnos deficiency]]

# [[STAT5b deficiency]]
# [[Itk deficiency]]
# [[DOCK8 deficiency]]

===Table II: Predominantly antibody deﬁciencies ===
In primary [[Humoral immune deficiency|antibody deficiencies]], one or more isotypes of [[immunoglobulin]] are decreased or don't function properly. These proteins, generated by [[plasma cell]]s, normally bind to pathogens, targeting them for destruction.<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# Absent B cells with a resultant severe reduction of all types of antibody: [[X-linked agammaglobulinemia]] ([[Bruton's tyrosine kinase|btk]] deficiency, or [[Ogden Bruton|Bruton]]'s agammaglobulinemia), [[Immunoglobulin M|μ]]-[[Heavy chain]] deficiency, [[Immunoglobulin light chain|l 5]] deficiency, [[CD79|Igα]] deficiency, [[BLNK]] deficiency, [[thymoma with immunodeficiency]]
# B cells low but present or normal, but with reduction in 2 or more isotypes (usually IgG & IgA, sometimes IgM): [[common variable immunodeficiency]] (CVID), [[Inducible T-cell costimulator|ICOS]] deficiency, [[CD19]] deficiency, [[Tumor necrosis factor receptor|TACI]] (TNFRSF13B) deficiency, [[B-cell activating factor|BAFF receptor]] deficiency.
# Normal numbers of B cells with decreased [[IgG]] and [[IgA]] and increased [[IgM]]: [[Hyper-IgM syndromes]]
# Normal numbers of B cells with isotype or light chain deficiencies: [[heavy chain]] deletions, [[Immunoglobulin light chain|kappa chain]] deficiency, isolated IgG subclass deficiency, IgA with IgG subsclass deficiency, [[selective immunoglobulin A deficiency]]
# Specific antibody deficiency to specific antigens with normal B cell and normal Ig concentrations
# [[Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy]] (THI)

===Table III: Other well deﬁned immunodeﬁciency syndrome===
A number of syndromes escape formal classification but are otherwise recognisable by particular clinical or immunological features.<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# [[Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome]]
# [[DNA repair]] defects not causing isolated SCID: [[ataxia telangiectasia]], [[MRE11A|ataxia-like syndrome]], [[Nijmegen breakage syndrome]], [[Bloom syndrome]]

# Various immuno-osseous dysplasias ([[skeletal dysplasia|abnormal development of the skeleton]] with immune problems): [[cartilage-hair hypoplasia]], [[Schimke syndrome]]
# [[Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome]] type 2
# [[Hyper-IgE syndrome]]
# [[Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis]]
# [[Hepatic veno-occlusive disease|Hepatic venoocclusive disease with immunodeﬁciency]] (VODI)
# [[XL-dyskeratosis congenita]] ([[Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome]])

===Table IV: Diseases of immune dysregulation===
In certain conditions, the regulation rather than the intrinsic activity of parts of the immune system is the predominant problem.<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# Immunodeficiency with hypopigmentation or [[albinism]]: [[Chediak-Higashi syndrome]], [[Griscelli syndrome]] type 2
# [[Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis|Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]]: [[perforin]] deficiency, [[MUNC13D]] deficiency, [[syntaxin|syntaxin 11]] deficiency
# [[X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome]]
# Syndromes with autoimmunity:
## (a) [[Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome]]: type 1a ([[Fas receptor|CD95]] defects), type 1b ([[Fas ligand]] defects), type 2a ([[CASP10]] defects), type 2b ([[CASP8]] defects)
## (b) [[Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome|APECED]] (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy with candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy)
## (c) [[IPEX (syndrome)|IPEX]] (immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome)
## (d) [[CD25 deﬁciency]]

===Table V: Congenital defects of phagocyte number, function, or both===
[[Phagocyte]]s are the cells that engulf and ingest pathogens ([[phagocytosis]]), and destroy them with chemicals. [[Monocyte]]s/[[macrophage]]s as well as [[granulocyte]]s are capable of this process. In certain conditions, either the number of phagocytes is reduced or their functional capacity is impaired.<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# [[Severe congenital neutropenia]]: due to [[Neutrophil elastase|ELA2]] deficiency (with [[myelodysplasia]])
# [[Severe congenital neutropenia]]: due to [[GFI1]] deficiency (with T/B lymphopenia)
# [[Kostmann syndrome]]
# [[Neutropenia with cardiac and urogenital malformations]]
# [[Glycogen storage disease type 1b]]
# [[Cyclic neutropenia]]
# [[X-linked neutropenia/myelodysplasia]]
# [[P14 deﬁciency]]
# [[Leukocyte adhesion deficiency]] type 1
# [[Leukocyte adhesion deficiency]] type 2

# [[Interferon-gamma|Interferon γ receptor 2]] deficiency
# [[STAT1]] deficiency (2 forms)
# AD [[hyper-IgE]]
# AR [[hyper-IgE]]
# [[Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis]]

===Table VI: Defects in innate immunity===
Several rare conditions are due to defects in the [[innate immune system]], which is a basic line of defence that is independent of the more advanced lymphocyte-related systems. Many of these conditions are associated with skin problems.<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# [[Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]]
## [[IKBKG|NEMO]] deficiency
## [[NFKBIA|IKBA]] deficiency
# [[EDA-ID]]
# [[IRAK-4]] deficiency
# [[MyD88]] deﬁciency
# [[WHIM syndrome]] (warts, hypogammaglobulinaemia, infections, myleokathexis)
# [[Epidermodysplasia verruciformis]]
# [[Herpes simplex encephalitis]]
# [[Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis]]
# [[Trypanosomiasis]]

===Table VII: Autoinﬂammatory disorder===
Rather than predisposing for infections, most of the autoinflammatory disorders lead to excessive inflammation. Many manifest themselves as [[periodic fever syndrome]]s. They may involve various organs directly, as well as predisposing for long-term damage (e.g. by leading to [[amyloid]] deposition).<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# [[Familial Mediterranean fever]]
# [[TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome]] (TRAPS)
# [[Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever|Hyper-IgD syndrome]] (HIDS)
# ''[[CIAS1]]''-related diseases:
## [[Muckle-Wells syndrome]]
## [[Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome]]
## [[Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease]]
# [[PAPA syndrome]] ([[pyogenic]] sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne)
# [[Blau syndrome]]
# [[Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia]] ([[Majeed syndrome]])
# [[DIRA]] ([[deﬁciency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist]])

===Table VIII. Complement deﬁciencies===
The [[complement system]] is part of the innate as well as the adaptive immune system; it is a group of circulating proteins that can bind pathogens and form a membrane attack complex. [[Complement deficiency|Complement deficiencies]] are the result of a lack of any of these proteins. They may predispose to infections but also to autoimmune conditions.<ref name=Notrangelo2009/>
# [[C1Q complex|C1q deficiency]] (lupus-like syndrome, rheumatoid disease, infections)
# [[Complement component 1R|C1r deficiency]] (idem)
# [[C1s deﬁciency]]
# [[Complement component 4|C4 deficiency]] (idem)
# [[Complement component 2|C2 deficiency]] (lupus-like syndrome, vasculitis, polymyositis, [[pyogenic infection]]s)
# [[C3 (complement)|C3 deficiency]] (recurrent [[pyogenic infection]]s)
# [[Complement component 5|C5 deficiency]] (Neisserial infections, SLE)
# [[Complement component 6|C6 deficiency]] (idem)

# [[Membrane attack complex inhibitor (CD59) deﬁciency]]
# [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]
# [[Immunodeﬁciency associated with ﬁcolin 3 deﬁciency]]

==Treatment==
The treatment of primary immunodeficiencies depends foremost on the nature of the abnormality. This may range from immunoglobulin replacement therapy in antibody deficiencies—in the form of [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG)—to [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] for SCID and other severe immunodeficiences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Porta F, Forino C, De Martiis D, ''et al.'' |title=Stem cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiencies |journal=Bone Marrow Transplant. |volume=41 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=S83–6 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18545252 |doi=10.1038/bmt.2008.61 |url=}}</ref> Reduction of exposure to pathogens may be recommended, and in many situations prophylactic [[antibiotic]]s may be advised.

==Epidemiology==
A survey of 10,000 American households revealed that the prevalence of diagnosed primary immunodeficiency approaches 1 in 1200. This figure does not take into account people with mild immune system defects who have not received a formal diagnosis.<ref name=Boyle2007>{{cite journal |author=Boyle JM, Buckley RH |title=Population prevalence of diagnosed primary immunodeficiency diseases in the United States |journal=J. Clin. Immunol. |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=497–502 |year=2007 |pmid=17577648 |doi=10.1007/s10875-007-9103-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/b5r702t2820mk6l8/fulltext.html}}</ref>

Milder forms of primary immunodeficiency, such as [[selective immunoglobulin A deficiency]], are fairly common, with random groups of people (such as otherwise healthy blood donors) having a rate of 1:600. Other disorders are distinctly more uncommon, with incidences between 1:100,000 and 1:2,000,000 being reported.<ref name=Lim2004/>
