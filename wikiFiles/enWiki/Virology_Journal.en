}}{{Retracted|intentional=yes}}</ref> According to {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:29–33}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|8:14–15}}, the mother-in-law of [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]] "lay sick" with a febrile illness. [[Jesus]] then took her by the hand and the fever immediately left. This is also described in {{Bibleverse||Luke|4:38-39}}. The authors rule out that the woman was possessed by demons, and conclude that she was struck with [[influenza]] as "the fever retreated instantaneously. This implies that the disease was probably not a severe acute bacterial infection (such as [[sepsis|septicemia]]) or [[subacute bacterial endocarditis|subacute endocarditis]] that would not resolved instantaneously" {{sic}}.

This article created controversy amongst scientists, who decried the article from anywhere from "truly bizarre"<ref name=Aetiology>
