{{Tone|date=September 2011}}Pregnancy related '''Pelvic Girdle Pain''' (PGP) causes [[Chronic pain|pain]], instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP has a long history of recognition, mentioned by Hippocrates<ref>Pubic Symphysis Separation. Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review (2002), 13: 141-155 Kelly Owens, Anne Pearson, Gerald Mason</ref> and later described in medical literature by Snelling.<ref name=childbearing>Pain In Childbearing, Key Issues In Management, Margaret Yerby, Lesley Page.</ref>

== Anatomy==
The [[pelvis]] is the largest bony part of the skeleton and contains three joints: the [[pubic symphysis]], and [[sacroiliac joint|two sacroiliac joints]]. A highly durable network of [[ligament]]s surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.

The pubic symphysis has a [[Fibrocartilage| fibrocartilage joint]] which may contain a fluid filled cavity and is avascular; it is supported by the [[Superior pubic ligament|superior]] and [[Inferior pubic ligament|arcuate ligaments]]. The sacroiliac joints are [[Synovial fluid|synovial]], but their movement is restricted throughout life and they are progressively obliterated by [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]. The nature of the bony pelvic ring with its three joints determines that no one joint can move independently of the other two.<ref>SPD: The Clinical Presentation, Prevalence, Aetiology, Risk Factors and Morbidity.

==Classification==
Prior to the 20th century, specialists of pregnancy-related PGP used varying terminologies. It is now referred to as Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain that may incorporate the following conditions:

* [[Diastasis symphysis pubis|Diastasis of the Symphysis Pubis]](DSP)
* [[Symphysis pubis dysfunction]](SPD)
* Pelvic Joint Syndrome
* Physiological Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Symptom Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Posterior Pelvic Pain
* Pelvic Arthropathy
* Inferior Pubic Shear/ Superior Pubic Shear /Symphyseal Shear
* Symphysiolysis
* [[Osteitis pubis]] (usually postpartum)
* [[Sacroiliac joint|Sacroiliitis]]
* One-sided Sacroiliac Syndrome /Double Sided Sacroiliac Syndrome
* [[Hypermobility]]

''"The classification between hormonal and mechanical pelvic girdle instability is no longer used. For treatment and/or prognosis it makes no difference whether the complaints started during pregnancy or after childbirth." Mens (2005)''<ref name="multiple">About Pelvic Girdle Instability. Definition and Concept. Jan M.A. Mens.</ref>

== Symptoms ==
A combination of postural changes, the growing baby, unstable pelvic joints under the influence of pregnancy hormones and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort. In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall, sudden abduction of the thighs (opening too wide too quickly)or an action that has strained the joint.

PGP can begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Pain is usually felt low down over the symphyseal joint, and this area may be extremely tender to the touch. Pain may also be felt in the hips, groin and lower abdomen and can radiate down the inner thighs. Women suffering from PGP may begin to waddle or shuffle, and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis. PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy, gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses.

During pregnancy and postpartum, the symphyseal gap can be felt moving and/or straining when walking, climbing stairs and turning over in bed. These activities can be difficult or even impossible. Pain may remain static, i.e. in one place such as the front of the pelvis producing the feeling of having been kicked, in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas, you may even experience a combination of symptoms. Any weight bearing activity has the potential of aggravating an already unstable pelvis producing symptoms that may limit the ability for the woman to carry out many daily activities. She will experience pain involving movements such as dressing, getting in and out of the bath, rolling in bed, climbing the stairs and sexual activity. Pain will also be present when lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling.

The symptoms (and their severity) experienced by women with PGP vary, but include:

* Present swelling and/or inflammation over joint.
* Difficulty lifting leg.
* Pain pulling legs apart.
* Inability to stand on one leg.
* Inability to transfer weight through pelvis and legs.
* Pain in hips and/or restriction of hip movement.
* Transferred nerve pain down leg.
* Can be associated with bladder and/or bowel dysfunction.
* A feeling of symphysis pubis giving way.
* Stooped back when standing.
* Malalignment of pelvic and/or back joints.
* Struggle to sit or stand.
* Pain may also radiate down the inner thighs.
* Waddling or shuffling gait.
* Audible ‘clicking’ sound coming from the pelvis.

===Severity===
The severity and instability of the pelvis can be measured on a three level scale.

'''Pelvic type 1:'''The pelvic ligaments support the pelvis sufficiently. Even when the
muscles are used incorrectly, no complaints will occur when performing everyday activities. This is the most common situation in persons who have never been pregnant, who have never been in an accident, and who are not hyperactive.''

'''Pelvic type 2:'''The ligaments alone do not support the joint sufficiently. A
coordinated use of muscles around the joint will compensate for ligament weakness. In case the muscles around the joint do not function, the patient will experience pain and weakness when performing everyday activities. This kind of pelvic often occurs after giving birth to a child weighing 3000&nbsp;grams or more, in case of hyperactivity, and sometimes after an accident involving the pelvis. Type 2 is the most common form of pelvic instability. Treatment is based on learning how to use the muscles around the pelvis more efficiently.

'''Pelvic type 3:'''The ligaments do not support the joint sufficiently. This is a serious
situation whereby the muscles around the joint are unable to compensate for ligament weakness. This type of pelvic instability usually only occurs after an accident, or occasionally after a (small) accident in combination with giving birth. Sometimes a small accident occurring long before giving birth is forgotten so that the pelvic instability is attributed only to the childbirth. Although the difference between Type 2 and 3 is often difficult to establish, in case of doubt an exercise program may help the patient. However, if Pelvic Type 3 has been diagnosed then invasive treatment is the only option: in this case parts of the pelvis are screwed together. (Mens 2005)<ref name="multiple"/>

===Psychosocial impact===
PGP in pregnancy seriously interferes with participation in society and activities of daily life; the average sick leave due to posterior pelvic pain during pregnancy is 7 to 12 weeks.<ref>Reduction of Sick Leave for Lumbar Back and Posterior Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy. Spine. 22(18):2157-2160, September 15, 1997. Noren, Lotta RPT, Ostgaard, Solveig, Nielsen, Thorkild F, Ostgaard, Hans C</ref>

In some cases women with PGP may also experience emotional problems such as anxiety over the cause of pain, resentment, anger, lack of self-esteem, frustration and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; she is three times more likely to suffer [[Postpartum depression|postpartum depressive symptoms]].<ref>Pelvic girdle pain and lumbar pain in relation to postpartum depressive symptoms. Spine. 2007 Jun 1;32(13):1430-6. Gutke A, Josefsson A, Oberg B.</ref> Other psychosocial risk factors associated with woman experiencing PGP include higher level of stress, low job satisfaction and poorer relationship with spouse.<ref>Risk factors in developing pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain.

==Causes==
Sometimes there is no obvious explanation for the cause of PGP but usually there is a combination of factors such as:

# The pelvic joints moving unevenly.
# A change in the activity of the muscles in the pelvis, [[Hip (anatomy)|hip]], abdomen, back and [[pelvic floor]].
# A history of pelvic trauma.
# The position of the baby altering the loading stresses on the pelvic ligaments and joints.
# Strenuous work.<ref>Psychosocial and Physical Work Environment and Risk of Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy. A Study within the Danish National Birth Cohort. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health 2005;59:580-585, Mette Juhl, Per Kragh Andersen, Jørn Olsen, Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen</ref>
# Previous [[Low back pain|lower back pain]].
# Previous pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy.
# [[Hypermobility]], genetical ability to stretch joints beyond normal range.
# An event during the pregnancy or birth that caused injury or strain to the pelvic joints or rupture of the fibrocartilage.
# The occurrence of PGP is associated with twin pregnancy, first pregnancy and a higher age at first pregnancy.<ref>Understanding peripartum pelvic pain. Implications of a patient survey.

==Mechanism==
Pregnancy related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) can be either specific (trauma or injury to pelvic joints or genetical i.e. [[connective tissue disease]]) and non-specific. PGP disorder is complex and multi-factorial and likely to be also represented by a series of sub-groups driven by pain varying from [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] or [[central nervous system]],<ref>Diagnosis and classification of pelvic girdle pain disorders—Part 1: A mechanism based approach within a biopsychosocial framework Manual Therapy, Volume 12, Issue 2, May 2007, Peter B. O’Sullivan and Darren J. Beales.</ref>

[[Pregnancy]] begins the [[Physiology|physiological changes]] through a pattern of hormonal secretion and [[signal transduction]] thus initiating the remodelling of soft tissues, cartilage and ligaments. Over time, the ligaments could be stretched either by injury or excess strain and in turn may cause PGP.

===Relaxin hormone===
[[Relaxin]] is a [[hormone]] produced mainly by the [[corpus luteum]] of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy it is also produced by the [[placenta]], [[chorion]], and [[decidua]]. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of [[collagen]] thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, [[tendon]]s, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.

Although relaxin's main cellular action in pregnancy is to remodel collagen by [[biosynthesis]] (thus facilitating the changes of connective tissue) it does not seem to generate musculoskeletal problems. European Research has determined that relaxin levels are not a predictor of PGP during pregnancy.<ref>Normal Serum Relaxin in Women with Disabling Pelvic Pain During Pregnancy.

Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 1997 Jul;74(1):19-22. Albert H, Godskesen M, Westergaard JG, Chard T, Gunn L.</ref>

===Gait changes===
The pregnant woman has a different pattern of "[[Gait analysis|gait]]". The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses due to weight gain and changes in posture. Both the length and height of the footstep shortens with PGP. Sometimes the foot can turn inwards due to the rotation of the hips when the pelvic joints are unstable. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones that are released to adapt the bodily changes also remodel the ligaments in the foot. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention and weight gain lowers the arches, further adding to the foot's length and width. There is an increase of load on the lateral side of the foot and the hind foot. These changes may also be responsible for the musculoskeletal complaints of lower limb pain in pregnant women.

During the motion of walking, an upward movement of the pelvis, one side then the other, is required to let the leg follow through. The faster or longer each step the pelvis adjusts accordingly. The flexibility within the knees, ankles and hips are stabilized by the pelvis. Normal gait tends to minimize displacement of centre of gravity whereas abnormal gait through pelvic instability tends to amplify displacement. During pregnancy there may be an increased demand placed on hip abductor, hip extensor, and [[Ankle|ankle plantar flexor muscles]] during walking. To avoid pain on weight bearing structures a very short stance phase and limp occurs on the injured side(s), this is called [[Gait abnormality|Antalgic Gait]].

==Treatment==
Once a diagnosis of PGP has been made there are various treatments that can be applied. One of the main factors in helping women cope with the condition is with education, information and support. Other coping strategies include [[physical medicine and rehabilitation]], [[physiotherapy]], [[pelvic pain therapy]], [[osteopathy]], [[chiropractic]], [[psychologist]], [[prolo therapy or platelet-rich plasma therapy]], [[massage therapy]], [[acupuncture]]<ref name=effects>Effects of acupuncture and stabilising exercises as adjunct to standard treatment in pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain: randomised single blind controlled trail. BMY 2005;330;761 H Elden, L Ladfors, M Fagevik Olsen, H-C Östgaard, H Hagber.</ref><ref name= Pelvic>Pelvic Girdle Pain in Pregnancy. BMJ 2005;331:249-250 (30 July), {{doi|10.1136/bmj.331.7511.249}} Editorial, R. William Stones,Kathleen Vits</ref><ref>Acupuncture works for pelvic girdle pain in pregnant women. Editorial, BMJ.;2005; 330 (2 April), {{doi|10.1136/bmj.330.7494.0-c}}</ref> and [[alternative medicine]]. Mobility aids such as a [[wheelchair]], [[Walker (mobility)|walker]], [[Crutch|elbow crutches]] and [[walking stick]] can be very useful. [[Medication]] dispensed by a qualified [[health care provider]] can also be used to manage:
*[[Chronic pain]]
*[[Anxiety]]
*Depression
*[[Post traumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]](resulting from birth trauma/ pregnancy)
*Musculo-skeletal disorders.

Some pelvic joint trauma will not respond to conservative type treatments and [[orthopedic surgery]] might become the only option to stabilize the joints.

===Self-help management===
Self-help management techniques include:

* When getting into bed sit on the edge keeping knees close together, lie down on your side, lifting both legs at the same time. Reverse this to get up.
* Try not to attempt to pull yourself up from lying on your back.
* Keep knees together when rolling over in bed.
* Sleep with a pillow between the legs; add more in other areas for support.
* When getting into a car: Sit down first and then swing legs keeping them together.
* Avoid sofas and chairs that are too low or too soft.
* Try to reduce the stress on the joint.
* Avoid any movement with your knees apart.
* Take smaller steps when walking.
* Avoid stairs if possible.
* Take breaks.
* Move within the limits of pain.
* Avoid twisting, bending or squatting.

Many women find floating in a heated pool relieves the pain.

==Prognosis and epidemiology==
For most women PGP resolves in weeks after delivery but for some it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for [[weight bearing]] activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside.<ref>Symptom-Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation in Pregnancy. I: Prevalence and Risk Factors.
