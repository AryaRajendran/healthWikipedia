'''Phosphate binders''' are a group of medications used to reduce the absorption of [[phosphate]] and taken with meals and snacks.  They are typically used in patients with [[chronic renal failure]] (CRF) as they cannot get rid of the phosphates that get into their blood (i.e. the serum phosphate in chronic renal failure is typically elevated). 

==Clinical use==
For patients with chronic renal failure, controlling [[blood plasma|serum]] [[phosphate]] is important because it is associated with bone pathology and regulated together with serum [[calcium]] by the [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH).{{ref|Lederer}}

==Mechanism of action==
These agents work by binding to phosphate in the [[GI tract]], thereby making it unavailable to the body for absorption.  Hence, these drugs are usually taken with meals to bind any phosphate that may be present in the ingested food.  Phosphate binders may be simple molecular entities (such as [[aluminium]], calcium, or [[lanthanum]] salts) that react with phosphate and form an [[insoluble]] compound.  Phosphate binders, such as [[sevelamer]], may also be [[polymer]]ic structures which bind to phosphate and are then excreted.

==Adverse effects==
With regard to phosphate binders, aluminium-containing compounds (such as [[aluminium hydroxide]]) are the least preferred because prolonged aluminium intake can cause [[encephalopathy]] and [[osteomalacia]].  If calcium is already being used as a supplement, additional calcium used as a phosphate binder may cause [[hypercalcemia]] and tissue-damaging [[calcinosis]].  One may avoid these adverse effects by using phosphate binders that do not contain calcium or aluminium as active ingredients, such as [[lanthanum carbonate]] or sevelamer.

==Common phosphate binders==
*[[Aluminium hydroxide]] (Alucaps, Basaljel)
*[[Calcium carbonate]] (Calcichew, Titralac)
*[[Calcium acetate]] (Phosex, PhosLo)
*[[Lanthanum carbonate]] (Fosrenol)
*[[Sevelamer]] (Renagel, Renvela)
*[[Calcium acetate/magnesium carbonate]] (Renepho, OsvaRen)
