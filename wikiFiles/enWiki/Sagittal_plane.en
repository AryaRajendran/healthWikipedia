'''Sagittal plane''' is a vertical plane which passes from ventral (front) to dorsal (rear) dividing the body into right and left halves.<ref name="Vella2008">{{cite book|author=Mark Vella|title=Anatomy for Strength and Fitness Training|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Beed0ml1t6IC&pg=PA16|accessdate=4 January 2013|date=May 2008|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84773-153-1|pages=16–}}</ref>

==Variations==
Examples include:

* The terms ''[[median plane]]'' or ''mid-sagittal plane'' are sometimes used to describe the sagittal plane running through the midline. This plane cuts the body into halves (assuming [[bilateral symmetry]]),<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000083004|Median plane}}</ref> passing through midline structures such as the [[navel]] and [[Vertebral column|spine]]. It is one of the lines defining the [[Right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]] of the [[human abdomen]].

*The term ''parasagittal'' is used to describe any plane parallel to the sagittal plane. In practice, such a section is often referred to simply as a "sagittal" view because viewing is achieved along the sagittal axis (see below). Due to the specific nature of its definition, only one true sagittal plane exists, and it corresponds to the "mid-sagittal" view. Be aware that the term "sagittal view" may be applied to any parasagittal section as well as the sagittal plane, as the parasagittal and sagittal axes are identical (parallel to the [[sagittal plane]]). <BR> Specific named parasagittal planes include:  
** The [[midclavicular line]] crosses through the [[clavicle]].
** Other sagittal lines/planes include the ''lateral sternal'' and ''parasternal''.<ref name="isbn0-7817-9013-1">{{cite book |author=Yokochi, Chihiro; [[Rohen, Johannes W.]] |title=Color Atlas of Anatomy: A Photographic Study of the Human Body |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |pages=2006. 217 p. |isbn=0-7817-9013-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Terminology==
The term ''sagittal'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''Sagitta'', meaning "arrow". An image of an arrow piercing a body and passing from front (anterior) to back (posterior) on a parabolic [[trajectory of a projectile|trajectory]] would be one way to demonstrate the derivation of the term. Another explanation would be the notching of the [[sagittal suture]] posteriorly by the [[lambdoidal suture]] —similar to feathers on an arrow.

*''Sagittal axis'' is the axis perpendicular to the sagittal plane, i.e., the sagittal [[axis of symmetry|axis]] is formed by the intersection of the coronal and the transversal planes.

*''Coronal axis'' or ''frontal axis'' is the axis perpendicular to the coronal plane, i.e., the one formed by the intersection of the sagittal and the transversal planes. 

*''[[Extension (kinesiology)|Extension]]'' and ''[[flexion]]'' are the movements of limbs relative to the sagittal plane.

*''[[Abduction (kinesiology)|Abduction]]'' and ''[[adduction]]'' are terms for movements of limbs relative to the [[coronal plane]] (also known as the [[frontal plane]]).
