A '''[[peptic]] ulcer''', also known as '''peptic ulcer disease''' ('''PUD'''),<ref name="medmag">{{Cite web| url= http://www.emedmag.com/html/pre/gic/consults/071503.asp| title=GI Consult: Perforated Peptic Ulcer|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> is the most common [[ulcer]] of an area of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] that is usually acidic and thus extremely painful.  It is defined as mucosal erosions equal to or greater than 0.5&nbsp;cm. As many as 70–90% of such ulcers are associated with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', a helical-shaped bacterium that lives in the acidic environment of the stomach; however, only 40% of those cases go to a doctor{{fact|date=March 2013}}. Ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as [[aspirin]],  [[ibuprofen]], and other [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peptic ulcer|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001255/}}</ref> 

Four times as many peptic ulcers arise in the [[duodenum]]—the first part of the [[small intestine]], just after the stomach—as in the [[stomach]] itself. About 4% of gastric ulcers are caused by a [[malignant]] tumor, so multiple biopsies are needed to exclude cancer. Duodenal ulcers are generally [[benign]].

==Classification==
'''By Region/Location'''
*[[Duodenum]] (called duodenal ulcer)
*[[Esophagus]] (called esophageal ulcer)
*[[Stomach]] (called gastric ulcer)
*[[Meckel's diverticulum]] (called Meckel's diverticulum ulcer; is very tender with palpation)

'''Modified Johnson Classification of peptic ulcers:'''
*Type '''I''':   Ulcer along the body of the stomach, most often along the lesser curve at incisura angularis along the locus minoris resistantiae.
*Type '''II''':  Ulcer in the body in combination with duodenal ulcers. Associated with acid oversecretion.
*Type '''III''': In the pyloric channel within 3&nbsp;cm of pylorus. Associated with acid oversecretion.
*Type '''IV''':  Proximal gastroesophageal ulcer
*Type '''V''': Can occur throughout the stomach.  Associated with chronic NSAID use (such as [[aspirin]]).

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of a peptic ulcer can be
*[[abdominal pain]], classically [[epigastrium|epigastric]] strongly correlated to mealtimes. In case of  duodenal ulcers the pain appears about three hours after taking a meal;
*[[bloating]] and abdominal fullness;
*waterbrash (rush of saliva after an episode of regurgitation to dilute the acid in esophagus - although this is more associated with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]);
*nausea, and copious vomiting;
*loss of appetite and weight loss;
*[[hematemesis]] (vomiting of blood); this can occur due to bleeding directly from a gastric ulcer, or from damage to the esophagus from severe/continuing vomiting.
*[[melena]] (tarry, foul-smelling feces due to [[oxidation|oxidized]] iron from [[hemoglobin]]);
*rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal [[perforation]], which leads to [[acute peritonitis]]. This is extremely painful and requires immediate surgery.

A history of [[heartburn]], [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include [[NSAID]] (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit [[cyclooxygenase]], and most [[glucocorticoid]]s (e.g. [[dexamethasone]] and [[prednisolone]]).

In patients over 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms, the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]].

The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give [[epigastrium|epigastric]] pain during the meal, as [[gastric acid]] production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the [[pyloric sphincter]] closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2–3 hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the [[duodenum]].

Also, the symptoms of peptic ulcers may vary with the location of the ulcer and the patient's age. Furthermore, typical ulcers tend to heal and recur and as a result the pain may occur for few days and weeks and then wane or disappear.<ref name="Peptic Ulcer">{{Cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive_disorders/peptic_disorders/peptic_ulcer.html |title=Peptic Ulcer |date=October 2006 |work=Home Health Handbook for Patients & Caregivers |publisher=Merck Manuals}}</ref> Usually, [[child]]ren and the [[elderly]] do not develop any symptoms unless complications have arisen.

Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach area lasting between 30 minutes and 3 hours commonly accompanies ulcers. This pain can be misinterpreted as [[hunger]], [[indigestion]] or [[heartburn]]. Pain is usually caused by the ulcer but it may be aggravated by the [[stomach acid]] when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area. The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the [[Human sternum|sternum]], it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty. Also, sometimes the pain may flare at night and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti-acid medication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peptic-ulcer/ds00242/dsection=symptoms| title=Peptic ulcer |accessdate= 2010-06-18}}</ref> However, peptic ulcer disease symptoms may be different for every sufferer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ulcerdisease.net/| title=Ulcer Disease Facts and Myths |accessdate= 2010-06-18}}</ref>

===Complications===
*[[Upper gastrointestinal bleeding|Gastrointestinal bleeding]] is the most common complication. Sudden large bleeding can be life-threatening.<ref name="pmid9391242">{{Cite journal|author=Cullen DJ, Hawkey GM, Greenwood DC, ''et al. '' |title=Peptic ulcer bleeding in the elderly: relative roles of Helicobacter pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs |journal=Gut |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=459–62 |year=1997 |pmid=9391242 |pmc=1891536 |doi= 10.1136/gut.41.4.459|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9391242}}</ref> It occurs when the ulcer erodes one of the blood vessels, such as the gastroduodenal artery.
*[[Gastrointestinal perforation|Perforation]] (a hole in the wall) often leads to catastrophic consequences. Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute [[peritonitis]], initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain. Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to involvement of gastroduodenal artery that lies posterior to the 1st part of duodenum.
*[[Perforation]] and [[penetration]] are when the ulcer continues into adjacent organs such as the liver and [[pancreas]].<ref name="Peptic Ulcer"/>
*[[Gastric outlet obstruction]] is the narrowing of pyloric canal by scarring and swelling of gastric antrum and duodenum due to peptic ulcers. Patient often presents with severe vomiting without bile.
*[[Cancer]] is included in the differential diagnosis (elucidated by [[biopsy]]), [[Helicobacter pylori]] as the etiological factor making it 3 to 6 times more likely to develop stomach cancer from the ulcer.<ref name="Peptic Ulcer"/>

==Cause==
A major causative factor (60% of gastric and up to 90% of duodenal ulcers) is chronic [[inflammation]] due to ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' that [[Colonisation (biology)|colonizes]] the [[Pyloric antrum|antral]] [[mucosa]].<ref>http://www.humpath.com/spip.php?article7501</ref> The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the [[bacterium]] can cause a chronic active [[gastritis]] (type B gastritis), resulting in a defect in the regulation of [[gastrin]] production by that part of the stomach, and gastrin secretion can either be increased, or as in most cases, decreased, resulting in hypo- or [[achlorhydria]]. [[Gastrin]] stimulates the production of [[gastric acid]] by parietal cells. In ''H. pylori'' colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid can contribute to the erosion of the [[mucosa]] and therefore ulcer formation. Studies in the varying occurrence of ulcers in third world countries despite high ''H. pylori'' colonization rates suggest dietary factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.<ref>Ma LS ''A Tribute to Dr Frank I Tovey on his 90th Birthday'' World J Gastroentol 2011 August 21: 17(31):3565–3566</ref>

Another major cause is the use of [[NSAID]]s. The gastric mucosa protects itself from [[gastric acid]] with a layer of mucus, the secretion of which is stimulated by certain prostaglandins. NSAIDs block the function of [[cyclooxygenase]] 1 (''cox-1''), which is essential for the production of these prostaglandins. COX-2 selective anti-inflammatories (such as [[celecoxib]] or the since withdrawn [[rofecoxib]]) preferentially inhibit ''cox-2'', which is less essential in the gastric mucosa, and roughly halve the risk of NSAID-related gastric ulceration.

The incidence of duodenal ulcers has dropped significantly during the last 30 years, while the incidence of gastric ulcers has shown a small increase, mainly caused by the widespread use of NSAIDs. The drop in incidence is considered to be a cohort-phenomenon independent of the progress in treatment of the disease. The cohort-phenomenon is probably explained by improved standards of living which has lowered the incidence of ''H. pylori'' infections.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johannessen T |title=Peptic ulcer disease |journal=Pasienthandboka |url=http://www.pasienthandboka.no/default.asp?mode=document&parentid=2104&menuid=2105&documentid=26957}}</ref>

Although some studies have found correlations between smoking and ulcer formation,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Prospective Study of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcer and Its Relation to Smoking, Alcohol, and Diet |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |year=1992 |first=Ikuko |last=Kato |coauthors=Abraham M.

[[Gastrinoma]]s ([[Zollinger Ellison syndrome]]), rare gastrin-secreting tumors, also cause multiple and difficult-to-heal ulcers.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Gastric ulcer 3.jpg|right|thumb|Endoscopic image of gastric ulcer, biopsy proven to be [[gastric cancer]].]]
The diagnosis is mainly established based on the characteristic symptoms. Stomach pain is usually the first signal of a peptic ulcer. In some cases, doctors may treat ulcers without diagnosing them with specific tests and observe whether the symptoms resolve, thus indicating that their primary diagnosis was accurate.

Confirmation of the diagnosis is made with the help of tests such as endoscopies or barium contrast [[x-rays]]. The tests are typically ordered if the symptoms do not resolve after a few weeks of treatment, or when they first appear in a person who is over age 45 or who has other symptoms such as [[weight loss]], because [[stomach cancer]] can cause similar symptoms. Also, when severe ulcers resist treatment, particularly if a person has several ulcers or the ulcers are in unusual places, a doctor may suspect an underlying condition that causes the stomach to overproduce [[acid]].<ref name="Peptic Ulcer"/>

An [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] (EGD), a form of [[endoscopy]], also known as a [[gastroscopy]], is carried out on patients in whom a peptic ulcer is suspected. By direct visual identification, the location and severity of an ulcer can be described. Moreover, if no ulcer is present, EGD can often provide an alternative diagnosis.

One of the reasons that [[blood tests]] are not reliable for accurate peptic ulcer diagnosis on their own is their inability to differentiate between past exposure to the bacteria and current infection. Additionally, a false negative result is possible with a blood test if the patient has recently been taking certain drugs, such as [[antibiotics]] or [[proton pump inhibitors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peptic-ulcer/DS00242/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis| title=Peptic ulcer |accessdate= 2010-06-18}}</ref>

The diagnosis of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' can be made by:
*[[Urea breath test]] (noninvasive and does not require EGD);
*Direct culture from an EGD biopsy specimen; this is difficult to do, and can be expensive.  Most labs are not set up to perform ''H. pylori'' cultures;
*Direct detection of [[urease]] activity in a biopsy specimen by [[rapid urease test]];
*Measurement of [[antibody]] levels in [[blood]] (does not require EGD). It is still somewhat controversial whether a positive antibody without EGD is enough to warrant eradication therapy;
*Stool [[antigen]] test;
*Histological examination and staining of an EGD biopsy.

The breath test uses radioactive [[carbon atom]] to detect H. pylori.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peptic-ulcer/DS00242/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis| title=Tests and diagnosis |accessdate= 2010-06-18}}</ref> To perform this exam the patient will be asked to drink a tasteless liquid which contains the carbon as part of the substance that the bacteria breaks down. After an hour, the patient will be asked to blow into a bag that is sealed. If the patient is infected with H. pylori, the breath sample will contain radioactive [[carbon dioxide]]. This test provides the advantage of being able to monitor the response to treatment used to kill the bacteria.

The possibility of other causes of ulcers, notably [[malignancy]] ([[gastric cancer]]) needs to be kept in mind. This is especially true in ulcers of the ''greater (large) curvature'' of the [[stomach]]; most are also a consequence of chronic ''H. pylori'' infection.

If a peptic ulcer perforates, air will leak from the inside of the gastrointestinal tract (which always contains some air) to the peritoneal cavity (which normally never contains air). This leads to "free gas" within the peritoneal cavity. If the patient stands erect, as when having a chest X-ray, the gas will float to a position underneath the diaphragm. Therefore, gas in the peritoneal cavity, shown on an erect chest X-ray or supine lateral abdominal X-ray, is an omen of perforated peptic ulcer disease.

===Macroscopic appearance===
[[Image:Benign gastric ulcer 1.jpg|thumb|A benign gastric ulcer (from the antrum) of a [[gastrectomy]] specimen.]]

Gastric ulcers are most often localized on the lesser curvature of the stomach. The ulcer is a round to oval parietal defect ("hole"), 2 to 4&nbsp;cm diameter, with a smooth base and perpendicular borders. These borders are not elevated or irregular in the acute form of peptic ulcer, regular but with elevated borders and inflammatory surrounding in the chronic form. In the ulcerative form of gastric cancer the borders are irregular. Surrounding mucosa may present radial folds, as a consequence of the parietal scarring.

===Microscopic appearance===
A gastric peptic ulcer is a mucosal defect which penetrates the [[muscularis mucosae]] and lamina propria, produced by acid-pepsin aggression. Ulcer margins are perpendicular and present chronic gastritis. During the active phase, the base of the ulcer shows 4 zones: inflammatory exudate, fibrinoid necrosis, granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. The fibrous base of the ulcer may contain vessels with thickened wall or with thrombosis.<ref name="pathologyatlas">{{Cite web| url= http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/chronic-peptic-ulcer.php| title=ATLAS OF PATHOLOGY|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Younger patients with ulcer-like symptoms are often treated with [[antacid]]s or [[H2 antagonist]]s before EGD is undertaken. [[Bismuth subsalicylate|Bismuth compounds]] may actually reduce or even clear organisms {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}, though the warning labels of some bismuth subsalicylate products indicate that the product should not be used by someone with an ulcer.<ref name=PEPTO>{{cite web|title=PEPTO-BISMOL ORIGINAL LIQUID|url=http://www.pepto-bismol.com/pepto-original-liquid.php|work=PEPTO-BISMOL|publisher=PROCTOR AND GAMBLE|accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref>

Patients who are taking [[NSAIDs|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories]] (NSAIDs) may also be prescribed a [[prostaglandin]] [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] ([[Misoprostol]]) in order to help prevent peptic ulcers, which are a [[adverse effect|side-effect]] of the NSAIDs.

When ''H. pylori'' infection is present, the most effective treatments are combinations of 2 antibiotics (e.g. [[Clarithromycin]], [[Amoxicillin]], [[Tetracycline]], [[Metronidazole]]) and 1 [[proton pump inhibitor]] (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. [[amoxicillin]] + [[clarithromycin]] + metronidazole) may be used together with a PPI and sometimes with bismuth compound. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated cases would be Amoxicillin + [[Metronidazole]] + [[Pantoprazole]] (a PPI). In the absence of ''H. pylori'', long-term higher dose PPIs are often used.

Treatment of ''H. pylori'' usually leads to clearing of infection, relief of symptoms and eventual healing of ulcers. Recurrence of infection can occur and retreatment may be required, if necessary with other antibiotics. Since the widespread use of PPI's in the 1990s, surgical procedures (like "highly selective [[vagotomy]]") for uncomplicated peptic ulcers  became obsolete.

Perforated peptic ulcer is a surgical emergency and requires surgical repair of the perforation. Most bleeding ulcers require endoscopy urgently to stop bleeding with cautery, injection, or [[endoclip|clipping]].

[[Ranitidine]] and [[famotidine]], which are both H2 antagonists, provide relief of peptic ulcers, heartburn, indigestion and excess stomach acid and prevention of these symptoms associated with excessive consumption of food and drink.  Ranitidine and famotidine are available over the counter at pharmacies, both as brand-name drugs and as generics, and work by decreasing the amount of acid the stomach produces allowing healing of ulcers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000094/| title=Ranitidine in Peptic Ulcer}}</ref>

[[Sucralfate]] (Carafate) has also been a successful treatment of peptic ulcers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvistavet.com/html/sucralfate.html|title=Sucralfate for Peptic Ulcer}}</ref>

The lifetime risk for developing a peptic ulcer is approximately 10%.<ref name="pmid18837773">{{Cite journal |author=Snowden FM |title=Emerging and reemerging diseases: a historical perspective |journal=Immunol.

In Western countries the prevalence of ''Helicobacter pylori'' infections roughly matches age (i.e., 20% at age 20, 30% at age 30, 80% at age 80 etc.). Prevalence is higher in third world countries where it is estimated at about 70% of the population, whereas developed countries show a maximum of 40% ratio. Overall, ''H. pylori'' infections show a worldwide decrease, more so in developed countries. Transmission is by food, contaminated groundwater, and through human saliva (such as from kissing or sharing food utensils).<ref name="pmid11218379">{{Cite journal |author=Brown LM |title=''Helicobacter pylori'': epidemiology and routes of transmission. |journal=Epidemiol.

A minority of cases of ''H. pylori'' infection will eventually lead to an ulcer and a larger proportion of people will get non-specific discomfort, abdominal pain or gastritis.

Peptic ulcer disease had a tremendous effect on morbidity and mortality until the last decades of the 20th century, when epidemiological trends started to point to an impressive fall in its incidence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/meid:32219| title=Peptic ulcer disease |accessdate= 2010-06-18}}</ref> The reason that the rates of peptic ulcer disease decreased is thought to be the development of new effective medication and acid suppressants and the discovery of the cause of the condition, ''H. pylori''.

In the [[United States]] about 4 million people have active peptic ulcers and about 350,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Four times as many duodenal ulcers as gastric ulcers are diagnosed. Approximately 3,000 deaths per year in the United States are due to duodenal ulcer and 3,000 to gastric ulcer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurata JH, Haile BM |title=Epidemiology of peptic ulcer disease |journal=Clin Gastroenterol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=289–307 |year=1984 |month=May |pmid=6378441 }}</ref>

=== Diet as a predisposing cause===

While working as a general surgeon at Holdsworthy Hospital, Mysore, India Dr Frank Tovey observed that the incidence of peptic ulcers was higher with staple diets of refined wheat flour and polished rice and much lower where the staple diets were village ground millet and pulses. Subsequently he and others have shown  a mix of phospholipids and phytosterol in these diets will prevent ulcers where rats are exposed to ulcerogenic treatment with NSAIDs. They have also shown that H. pylori has a similar incidence in both populations. The combination of phospholipids and phytosterols may be of value in the prevention and treatment of duodenal ulceration and protection against the ulcerogenic effect of NSAIDs.<ref>Ma LS.

''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' was rediscovered in 1982 by two [[Australia]]n scientists, [[Robin Warren]] and [[Barry Marshall|Barry J. Marshall]] as a causative factor for ulcers.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Marshall B.J. |title=Unidentified curved bacillus on gastric epithelium in active chronic gastritis |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |year=1983 |volume=1 |issue=8336 |pages=1273–75 |pmid=6134060 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(83)92719-8}}</ref> In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most gastric ulcers and gastritis were caused by colonization with this bacterium, not by [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[spicy food]] as had been assumed before.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Marshall B.J., Warren J.R. |title=Unidentified curved bacilli in the stomach patients with gastritis and peptic ulceration |journal=Lancet |year=1984 |volume=1 |issue=8390 |pages=1311–15 |pmid=6145023 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(84)91816-6}}</ref>

The ''H. pylori'' hypothesis was poorly received,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/thewrongstuff/2010/09/09/stress_doesn_t_cause_ulers_or_how_to_win_a_nobel_prize_in_one_easy_lesson_barry_marshall_on_being_right.html |title=Stress Doesn't Cause Ulcers!

His symptoms disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since [[halitosis]] is one of the symptoms of infection.<ref name="mja">{{Cite journal|author=Van Der Weyden MB, Armstrong RM, Gregory AT |title=The 2005 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine |journal=Med.

In 1997, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], with other government agencies, academic institutions, and industry, launched a national education campaign to inform health care providers and consumers about the link between ''H. pylori'' and ulcers. This campaign reinforced the news that ulcers are a curable infection, and that health can be greatly improved and money saved by disseminating information about ''H. pylori''.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ulcer/history.htm Ulcer, Diagnosis and Treatment - CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases]</ref>

In 2005, the [[Karolinska Institutet|Karolinska Institute in Stockholm]] awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] to Dr. Marshall and his long-time collaborator Dr. Warren "for their discovery of the bacterium ''Helicobacter pylori'' and its role in [[gastritis]] and peptic ulcer disease." Professor Marshall continues research related to ''H. pylori'' and runs a molecular biology lab at [[University of Western Australia|UWA]] in Perth, Western Australia.

Some believed that [[mastic gum]], a tree resin extract, actively eliminates the ''H. pylori'' bacteria.<ref name="pmid9874617">{{Cite journal |author=Huwez FU, Thirlwell D, Cockayne A, Ala'Aldeen DA |title=Mastic gum kills Helicobacter pylori [Letter to the editor, not a peer-reviewed scientific article] |journal=N.
