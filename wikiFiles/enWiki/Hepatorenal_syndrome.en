'''Hepatorenal syndrome''' (often abbreviated '''HRS''') is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of [[acute renal failure|rapid deterioration in kidney function]] in individuals with [[cirrhosis]] or [[fulminant]] [[liver failure]]. HRS is usually fatal unless a [[liver transplantation|liver transplant]] is performed, although various treatments, such as [[dialysis]], can prevent advancement of the condition.

HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis (regardless of cause), severe [[alcoholic hepatitis]], or fulminant hepatic failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of an acute injury such as an infection, [[upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage|bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract]], or overuse of [[diuretic]] medications.  HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of cirrhotics within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% of cirrhotics within five years of their diagnosis.

Deteriorating [[liver]] function is believed to cause changes in the [[splanchnic circulation|circulation that supplies the intestines]], altering [[hemodynamics|blood flow]] and blood vessel tone in the [[kidney]]s. The renal failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney; the kidneys themselves appear normal to the naked eye and tissue is normal when viewed under the [[microscope]], and the kidneys even function normally when placed in an otherwise healthy environment (such as if transplanted into a person with a healthy liver). The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition.  Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined: Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function, while type 2 HRS is associated with [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard [[diuretic]] medications.

The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical [[case series]]. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation.  While awaiting transplantation, people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone, including supportive care with medications, or the insertion of a [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] (TIPS), which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the [[portal vein]].  Some patients may require [[dialysis|hemodialysis]] to support kidney function, or a newer technique called [[liver dialysis]] which uses a dialysis circuit with [[albumin]]-bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver, providing a means of [[artificial extracorporeal liver support|extracorporeal liver support]] until transplantation can be performed.

=== Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome===
Type 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive renal failure, with a doubling of serum [[creatinine]] to a level greater than 221 [[micromole|μmol]]/L (2.5 [[milligram|mg]]/[[decilitre|dL]]) or a halving of the [[creatinine clearance]] to less than 20&nbsp;mL/min over a period of less than two weeks.

=== Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome ===
In contrast, type 2 HRS is slower in onset and progression.  It is defined by an increase in serum [[creatinine]] level to >133 μmol/L (1.5&nbsp;mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance of less than 40&nbsp;mL/min, and a urine sodium < 10 μmol/L.<ref name="pmid3297907">{{cite journal |author=Ginés P, Arroyo V, Quintero E, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of paracentesis and diuretics in the treatment of cirrhotics with tense ascites.

Type 2 HRS is thought to be part of a spectrum of illness associated with [[portal hypertension|increased pressures in the portal vein circulation]], which begins with the development of fluid in the abdomen ([[ascites]]). The spectrum continues with ''diuretic-resistant ascites'', where the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient sodium to clear the fluid even with the use of diuretic medications.  Most individuals with type 2 HRS have diuretic-resistant ascites before they develop deterioration in kidney function.<ref name=Blendis>{{cite journal |author=Blendis L, Wong F |title=The natural history and management of hepatorenal disorders: from pre-ascites to hepatorenal syndrome |journal=Clin Med |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=154–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12737373 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=1470-2118&volume=3&issue=2&spage=154&aulast=Blendis}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Both types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components: altered liver function, abnormalities in circulation, and renal failure.  As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course, individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests.  Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis, and may have signs and symptoms of the same, which can include [[jaundice]], [[hepatic encephalopathy|altered mental status]], evidence of decreased nutrition, and the presence of [[ascites]].<ref name=Ginesreview/>  Specifically, the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of [[diuretic]] medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS.  [[Oliguria]], which is a decrease in urine volume, may occur as a consequence of renal failure; however, some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine.<ref name=IAC/>  As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS, they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, and the exclusion of other causes.<ref name=IAC/>

==Causes==
Hepatorenal syndrome usually affects individuals with [[cirrhosis]] and elevated pressures in the [[portal vein]] system (termed [[portal hypertension]]).  While HRS may develop in any type of [[cirrhosis]], it is most common in individuals with [[cirrhosis|alcoholic cirrhosis]], particularly if there is concomitant [[alcoholic hepatitis]] identifiable on liver biopsies.<ref name=GinesCohort>{{cite journal |author=Ginès A, Escorsell A, Ginès P, ''et al.'' |title=Incidence, predictive factors, and prognosis of the hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhosis with ascites |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=229–36 |year=1993 |pmid=8514039 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  HRS can also occur in individuals without cirrhosis, but with acute onset of liver failure, termed [[fulminant hepatic failure]].<ref name=IAC/><ref name=GinesCohort/>

Certain precipitants of HRS have been identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant hepatic failure.  These include bacterial infection, acute [[alcoholic hepatitis]], or [[upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage|bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract]].  [[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]], which is the infection of [[ascites]] fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals.  HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: [[iatrogenic]] precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of [[diuretic]] medications or the removal of large volumes of [[ascites|ascitic fluid]] by [[paracentesis]] from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.<ref name=GinesCohort/>

==Diagnosis==
There can be many causes of kidney failure in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure.  Consequently, it is a challenge to distinguish hepatorenal syndrome from other entities that cause renal failure in the setting of advanced liver disease.  As a result, additional major and minor criteria have been developed to assist in the [[diagnosis]] of hepatorenal syndrome.<ref name=IAC/>

The '''major''' criteria include liver disease with [[portal hypertension]]; [[renal failure]]; the absence of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[infection]], recent treatment with medications that affect the function of the kidney ([[nephrotoxin]]s), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in renal function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of [[intravenous]] [[normal saline]]; the absence of [[proteinuria]] ([[protein]] in the [[urine]]); and, the absence of renal disease or obstruction of renal outflow as seen on [[ultrasound]].<ref name=IAC/>

The '''minor''' criteria are the following: a [[oliguria|low urine volume]] (less than {{convert|500|mL|0|abbr=on}} per day), low [[sodium]] concentration in the urine, a [[urine osmolality]] that is greater than that in the [[blood]], the absence of [[red blood cells]] in the urine, and a serum sodium concentration of less than 130&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name=IAC/>

Many other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome.  Individuals with [[Renal failure|pre-renal failure]] do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have renal dysfunction due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.  Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration.  In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum [[creatinine]] and increased excretion of sodium.<ref name=IAC/>  [[Acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure.  Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine.  As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics.<ref name=emed/>  Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of [[hyaline cast]]s or [[muddy-brown cast]]s in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured.<ref name=IAC/>  Some viral infections of the liver, including [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]] can also lead to inflammation of the [[glomerulonephritis|glomerulus]] of the kidney.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Han SH |title=Extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis B |journal=Clin Liver Dis |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=403–18 |year=2004 |pmid=15481347 |doi= 10.1016/j.cld.2004.02.003|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Philipneri M, Bastani B |title=Kidney disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C |journal=Curr Gastroenterol Rep |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=79–83 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11177699 |doi=10.1007/s11894-001-0045-0}}</ref>  Other causes of renal failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably the antibiotic [[gentamicin]]) or [[contrast nephropathy]], caused by intravenous administration of [[contrast medium|contrast]] agents used for medical imaging tests.<ref name=IAC/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:HRS and ascites pathophysiology.svg|thumb|right|350px|alt=Diagram: portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasoconstriction, which decreases effective cirulatory volume.

[[File:HRS spectrum.svg|thumb|right|400px|alt=Diagram: ascites, diuretic-resistant ascites and hepatorenal syndrome are a spectrum of clinical features. Portal hypertension is associated with all three. Splanchnic vasodilation is associated with all but ascites. Renal vasoconstriction is associated only with HRS.|Diagram showing hypothesized correlation between clinical features and pathophysiology of [[ascites]] and hepatorenal syndrome.]]
The [[renal failure]] in hepatorenal syndrome is believed to arise from abnormalities in [[blood vessel]] tone in the kidneys.<ref name=Ginesreview/> The predominant theory (termed the ''underfill'' theory) is that blood vessels in the renal circulation are constricted because of the dilation of blood vessels in the [[splanchnic circulation]] (which supplies the [[intestines]]), which is mediated by factors released by liver disease.<ref name=Arroyo1/><ref name=Schrier>{{cite journal |author=Schrier RW, Arroyo V, Bernardi M, Epstein M, Henriksen JH, Rodés J |title=Peripheral arterial vasodilation hypothesis: a proposal for the initiation of renal sodium and water retention in cirrhosis |journal=Hepatology |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=1151–7 |year=1988 |pmid=2971015 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840080532 }}</ref> [[Nitric oxide]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin PY, Ginès P, Schrier RW |title=Nitric oxide as a mediator of hemodynamic abnormalities and sodium and water retention in cirrhosis |journal=N.

Studies to quantify this theory have shown that there is an overall decreased [[systemic vascular resistance]] in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured [[femoral artery|femoral]] and renal fractions of [[cardiac output]] are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic [[vasodilation]] is implicated in the renal failure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fernandez-Seara J, Prieto J, Quiroga J, ''et al.'' |title=Systemic and regional hemodynamics in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites with and without functional renal failure |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=1304–12 |year=1989 |pmid=2676683 }}</ref> Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including [[atrial natriuretic factor]],<ref name=Lenz>{{cite journal |author=Lenz K, Hörtnagl H, Druml W, ''et al.'' |title=Ornipressin in the treatment of functional renal failure in decompensated liver cirrhosis.

The underfill theory involves activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in absorption of sodium from the renal tubule (termed ''renal sodium avidity'') mediated by [[aldosterone]], which acts on [[mineralocorticoid receptor]]s in the [[distal convoluted tubule]].<ref name=Blendis/><ref name=Schrier/>  This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of [[ascites]] in cirrhotics as well. It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to [[diuretic]] medications in ascites (which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS) and the onset of renal vasoconstriction (as described above) leading to hepatorenal syndrome.<ref name=Blendis/>

==Prevention==
[[File:Esophageal varices - wale.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Purple longitudinal tubular structures with red spots in the esophagus at the time of endoscopy|Picture of the [[esophagus]] at the time of [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscopy]] showing prominent [[esophageal varices]]. Bleeding from esophageal varices can be a precipitant for hepatorenal syndrome in individuals with [[cirrhosis]], and can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment.]]
The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; consequently, there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS.  As [[infection]] (specifically [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]]) and [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications  to prevent HRS.<ref name=emed/>  Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of [[ascites]] and can be preventable.  The aggressive use of [[diuretic]] medications should be avoided.  In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in renal function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS.<ref name=Arroyo1/><ref name=emed/>  Also, large volume [[paracentesis]]—which is the removal of [[ascites]] fluid from the abdomen using a needle or [[angiocath|catheter]] in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk.  The concomitant infusion of [[albumin]] can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large volume paracentesis, and may prevent HRS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Velamati PG, Herlong HF |title=Treatment of refractory ascites |journal=Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=530–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17081486 |doi= 10.1007/s11938-006-0009-4|url=}}</ref>  Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve renal function if it decreases the pressure on the [[renal vein]]s.<ref name=Sherlock>{{cite book |last=Sherlock |first=Sheila |coauthors=James Dooley |title=Diseases of the liver and biliary system |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=2002 |chapter=Chapter 9 |series=edition 11 |isbn=978-0-632-05582-1 }}</ref>

Individuals with ascites that has become infected spontaneously (termed [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] or SBP) are at an especially high risk for the development of HRS.<ref name=Ginesreview/>  In individuals with SBP, one [[randomized controlled trial]] found that the administration of intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on the third day in hospital reduced both the rate of renal insufficiency and the mortality rate.<ref name="pmid10432325">{{cite journal |author=Sort P, Navasa M, Arroyo V, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of intravenous albumin on renal impairment and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis |journal=N.

==Treatment==
===Liver transplantation===
The definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is [[orthotopic liver transplantation]], and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation.<ref name=Ng/><ref name=FloWo>{{cite journal |author=Wong F, Blendis L |title=New challenge of hepatorenal syndrome: prevention and treatment |journal=Hepatology |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1242–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11732014 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2001.29200 |url=}}</ref>  While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation.<ref name=Xu>{{cite journal |author=Xu X, Ling Q, Zhang M, ''et al.'' |title=Outcome of patients with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 after liver transplantation: Hangzhou experience |journal=Transplantation |volume=87 |issue=10 |pages=1514–9 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19461488 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181a4430b |url=}}</ref>  Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as [[model for end-stage liver disease]] scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation.<ref name=Xu/>  A further deterioration of renal function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of [[nephrotoxin|medications with toxicity to the kidneys]], and specifically the introduction of [[immunosuppressant]]s such as [[tacrolimus]] and [[cyclosporine]] that are known to worsen renal function.<ref name=Ginesreview/>  Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.<ref name=Ng/><ref name=Ginesreview/>

In anticipation of liver transplantation (which may be associated with considerable in-hospital delay), several other strategies have been found to be beneficial in preserving renal function.  These include the use of intravenous [[albumin]] infusion, medications (for which the best evidence is for analogues of [[vasopressin]], which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction), radiological shunts to decrease [[portal hypertension|pressure in the portal vein]], [[dialysis]], and a specialized albumin-bound membrane dialysis system termed [[molecular adsorbents recirculation system]] (MARS) or [[liver dialysis]].<ref name=Ginesreview/>

A [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] (TIPS) involves the decompression of the high pressures in the [[portal hypertension|portal]] circulation by placing a small stent between a [[Hepatic portal vein|portal]] and [[hepatic vein]].  This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the [[internal jugular vein]] or the [[femoral vein]].  Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately lead to the development of hepatorenal syndrome.  TIPS has been shown to improve renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome.<ref name=Blendis/><ref name=TIPS>{{cite journal |author=Wong F, Pantea L, Sniderman K |title=Midodrine, octreotide, albumin, and TIPS in selected patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome |journal=Hepatology |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=55–64 |year=2004 |pmid=15239086 |doi=10.1002/hep.20262 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Guevara M, Rodés J |title=Hepatorenal syndrome |journal=Int.

[[Liver dialysis]] involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation, usually through the addition of a second dialysis circuit that contains an albumin-bound membrane.  The [[Liver dialysis#Liver dialysis devices|molecular adsorbents recirculation system]] (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, yet the technique is still nascent.<ref name=Blendis/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mitzner SR, Stange J, Klammt S, ''et al.'' |title=Improvement of hepatorenal syndrome with extracorporeal albumin dialysis MARS: results of a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial |journal=Liver Transpl. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=277–86 |year=2000 |pmid=10827226 |doi=10.1053/lv.2000.6355|url= }}</ref>

[[Renal replacement therapy]] may be required to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Witzke O, Baumann M, Patschan D, ''et al.'' |title=Which patients benefit from hemodialysis therapy in hepatorenal syndrome? |journal=J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1369–73 |year=2004 |pmid=15610310 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1746.2004.03471.x |url=}}</ref>  The use of [[dialysis]], however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of renal function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of renal failure until transplantation can take place.  In patients who undergo [[hemodialysis]], there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to [[hypotension]] in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed.  As a result, the role of renal replacement therapy in patients with HRS remains unclear.<ref name=Ginesreview/>

==Epidemiology==
As the majority of individuals with hepatorenal syndrome have [[cirrhosis]], much of the epidemiological data on HRS comes from the cirrhotic population.  The condition is quite common: approximately 10% of individuals admitted to hospital with [[ascites]] have HRS.<ref name=GinesCohort/> A retrospective case series of cirrhotic patients treated with terlipressin suggested that 20.0% of acute renal failure in cirrhotics was due to type 1 HRS, and 6.6% was due to type 2 HRS.<ref name="pmid11910344"/> It is estimated that 18% of individuals with [[cirrhosis]] and [[ascites]] will develop HRS within one year of their diagnosis with cirrhosis, and 39% of these individuals will develop HRS within five years of diagnosis.<ref name=GinesCohort/> Three independent risk factors for the development of HRS in cirrhotics have been identified: liver size, plasma renin activity, and serum sodium concentration.<ref name=GinesCohort/>

The prognosis of these patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival.<ref name=Arroyo1/><ref name=GinesCohort/><ref name=FloWo/> The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the [[Model for End-Stage Liver Disease|MELD]] score) has been shown to be a determinant of outcome.<ref name=Xu/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alessandria C, Ozdogan O, Guevara M, ''et al.'' |title=MELD score and clinical type predict prognosis in hepatorenal syndrome: relevance to liver transplantation |journal=Hepatology |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1282–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15834937 |doi=10.1002/hep.20687 }}</ref> Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with [[alcoholic hepatitis]].<ref name=PTX>{{cite journal |author=Akriviadis E, Botla R, Briggs W, Han S, Reynolds T, Shakil O |title=Pentoxifylline improves short-term survival in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=1637–48 |year=2000 |pmid=11113085 |doi= 10.1053/gast.2000.20189|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508500511834 }}</ref>

==History==
The first reports of renal failure occurring in individuals with chronic liver diseases were from the late 19th century by Frerichs and Flint.<ref name=GinesCohort/>  However, the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute renal failure that occurred in the setting of [[biliary system|biliary surgery]].<ref name=Ng/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Helwig FC, Schutz CB |title=A liver kidney syndrome. Clinical pathological and experimental studies |journal=Surg Gynecol Obstet |volume=55 |pages=570–80 |year=1932}}</ref>  The syndrome was soon re-associated with advanced liver disease,<ref name=FloWo/> and, in the 1950s, was clinically defined by [[Sheila Sherlock|Sherlock]], Hecker, Papper and Vessin as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality.<ref name=GinesCohort/><ref name="pmid13377688">{{cite journal |author=Hecker R, Sherlock S |title=Electrolyte and circulatory changes in terminal liver failure |journal=Lancet |volume=271 |issue=6953 |pages=1121–5 |year=1956 |month=December |pmid=13377688 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output, very low [[sodium]] in the urine, and no protein in the urine.<ref name=Ng/>  Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and renal vasoconstriction as the key alterations in hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome.<ref name="pmid17699328">{{cite journal |author=Wadei HM, Mai ML, Ahsan N, Gonwa TA |title=Hepatorenal syndrome: pathophysiology and management |journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=1066–79 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=17699328 |doi=10.2215/CJN.01340406}}</ref>  The functional nature of the renal impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM196906192802501 |author=Koppel MH, Coburn JW, Mims MM, Goldstein H, Boyle JD, Rubini ME |title=Transplantation of cadaveric kidneys from patients with hepatorenal syndrome.

Med. |volume=280 |issue=25 |pages=1367–71 |year=1969 |pmid=4890476}}</ref> leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a renal disease. The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International Ascites Club, a group of [[hepatologist|liver specialists]]. The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and renal blood flow abnormalities of the condition.<ref name=GinesCohort/>
