=== History ===
An individual mandate to purchase healthcare was initially proposed by the [[conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] [[Heritage Foundation]] in 1989 as an alternative to [[single-payer health care]]. From its inception, the idea of an individual mandate was championed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians as a free-market approach to health-care reform.<ref name="nyt-mandate">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title= Conservatives Sowed Idea of Health Care Mandate, Only to Spurn It Later | first = Michael | last = Cooper | date = February 14, 2012 | accessdate=  July 2, 2012 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/health/policy/health-care-mandate-was-first-backed-by-conservatives.html}}</ref><ref name="new-yorker-klein"/> The individual mandate was felt to resonate with conservative principles of individual responsibility, and conservative groups recognized that the healthcare market was unique. [[Stuart Butler]], an early supporter of the individual mandate at the Heritage Foundation, wrote:
{{quote|If a young man wrecks his Porsche and has not had the foresight to obtain insurance, we may commiserate, but society feels no obligation to repair his car. But health care is different. If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance.<ref name="nyt-mandate"/>}}

In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|proposed a health-care reform bill]] which included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of [[health maintenance organization]]s. However, the Clinton plan failed amid concerns that it was overly complex or unrealistic, and in the face of an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health-insurance industry.<ref name="newsweek-clinton">{{cite news | work = [[Newsweek]] | title = The Lost Chance | first = Bob | last=  Cohn | coauthors = Eleanor Clift | date = September 18, 1994 | accessdate= July 2, 2012 | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1994/09/18/the-lost-chance.print.html}}</ref> At the time, Republican Senators proposed a bill that would have required individuals, and not employers, to buy insurance, as an alternative to Clinton's plan.<ref name="nyt-mandate"/>

An individual health-insurance mandate was initially enacted on a state level in Massachusetts. In 2006, Republican [[Mitt Romney]], then governor of Massachusetts, [[Massachusetts health care reform|signed an individual mandate into law]] with strong bipartisan support. In 2007, a [[Healthy Americans Act|Senate bill featuring a federal mandate]], authored by [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Utah|UT]]) and [[Ron Wyden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Oregon|OR]]), attracted substantial bipartisan support.<ref name="new-yorker-klein">{{cite news | work = [[The New Yorker]] | first = Ezra | last = Klein | authorlink = Ezra Klein | title = Unpopular Mandate | accessdate = June 19, 2012 | date = June 25, 2012 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_klein}}</ref><ref name="new-yorker-lizza">{{cite news | work = [[The New Yorker]] | title= Romney's dilemma | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/06/06/110606fa_fact_lizza | first = Ryan | last = Lizza | authorlink = Ryan Lizza | accessdate = June 19, 2012 | date = June 6, 2011}}</ref>

=== Affordable Care Act ===

Romney's success in installing an individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|Romney's 2008 Presidential campaign]], Sen. [[Jim DeMint]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[South Carolina|SC]]) praised Romney's ability to "take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured." Romney himself said of the individual mandate: "I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation."<ref name="new-yorker-lizza"/>

However, following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in 2009, Republicans began to oppose the mandate. In 2009, every Republican Senator (including Bennett, who had co-written the 2007 bill featuring a mandate) voted to describe the mandate as "unconstitutional". (Explaining his opposition, Bennett later said: "I didn't focus on the particulars of the amendment as closely as I should have, and probably would have voted the other way if I had understood that the individual mandate was at its core. I just wanted to express my opposition to the Obama proposal at every opportunity.")<ref name="new-yorker-klein"/> The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote: "It can be difficult to remember now, given the ferocity with which many Republicans assail it as an attack on freedom, but the provision in President Obama's health care law requiring all Americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking."<ref name="nyt-mandate"/>

Other Republican politicians who had previously supported individual mandates, including Romney and [[Orrin Hatch]], similarly emerged as vocal critics of the mandate in Obama's legislation.<ref name="new-yorker-klein"/><ref name="new-yorker-lizza"/> Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Ezra Klein stated that "the end result was...&nbsp;a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition."<ref name="new-yorker-klein"/> 

The Affordable Care Act signed in 2010 by Obama included an individual mandate to take effect in 2014, but was challenged in federal courts by Republican state Attorneys General. On June 28, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the provision as Constitutional.<ref name="Supreme Court Upholds The Health Care Law">{{cite news|title=Supreme Court Upholds The Health Care Law|url=http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/28/12457822-supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law?lite|accessdate=2012-06-28|newspaper=MSNBC|date=2012-06-28}}</ref> Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] delivered the majority opinion in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v.

Penalizing inaction, he argues, is only defensible when a fundamental duty of a person has been established. He also asserted that Congress fails to enforce the mandate under its taxing power because the penalty is not revenue-generating according to the Act itself.

==The Netherlands==
{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has a health insurance mandate<ref name="S&D">Robert E. Leu, Frans F. H. Rutten, Werner Brouwer, Pius Matter, and Christian Rütschi (January 2009). [http://mobile.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2009/Jan/The%20Swiss%20and%20Dutch%20Health%20Insurance%20Systems%20%20Universal%20Coverage%20and%20Regulated%20Competitive%20Insurance/Leu_swissdutchhltinssystems_1220%20pdf.pdf The Swiss and Dutch Health Insurance Systems: Universal Coverage and Regulated Competitive Insurance Markets] [[The Commonwealth Fund]] Accessed August 14, 2011.</ref> and allows for-profit companies to compete for minimum coverage insurance plans, though there are also mutual insurers so use of a commercial for-profit insurer is not compulsory. The government regulates the insurers and operates a [[risk equalization]] mechanism to subsidize insurers that insure relatively more expensive customers.  Several features hold down the level of premiums which facilitate public compliance with the mandate.  The cost of health care in the Netherlands is higher than the European average but is less than in the United States.  Half of the cost of insurance for adults is paid for by an income-related tax with which goes towards a subsidy of private insurance via the risk reinsurance pool operated by the regulator.  The government pays the entire cost for children. Forty percent of the population is eligible for a premium subsidy.  About 1.5 percent of the legal population is estimated to be uninsured.  The architects of the Dutch mandate did not envision any problem with non-compliance, the initial legislation created few effective sanctions if a person does not take out insurance or pay premiums, and the government is currently developing enforcement mechanisms.<ref name="NASI">[http://www.nasi.org/usr_doc/Administering_Health_Insurance_Mandates.pdf Administering Health Insurance Mandates], Steuerle, C E and Van de Water, Paul N.

==Switzerland==
{{Main|Health care in Switzerland}}
[[Switzerland]]'s system approximates to that of the Netherlands with regulated private insurance companies competing to provide the minimum necessary coverage to meet its mandate. Premiums are not linked to incomes, but the government provides [[subsidies]] to lower-class individuals to help them pay for their plans. About 40% of households received some kind of subsidy in 2004. Individuals are free to spend as much as they want for their plans and buy additional health services if desired. The system has virtual universal coverage, with about 99% of people having insurance. The laws behind the system were created in 1996.<ref name=switz>{{cite news|url=http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/health-care-abroad-switzerland/|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Health Care Abroad: Switzerland| first=Anne| last= Underwood| date=September 18, 2009}}</ref>  A recent issue in the country is their rising health care costs, which are higher than European averages. However, those rising costs are still a little less than the increases in the United States.<ref name=switz/>

{{anchor|employer_mandates}}

==Employer mandates==

In the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] includes both [[employer mandate|employer]] and [[individual mandate|individual]] mandates that take effect in 2014. In the two largest EU countries, [[France]] and [[Germany]], Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) mandates employers and employees pay into statutory sickness funds.  In France, private health insurance (PHI) is voluntary and used to increase the reimbursement rate from the statutory sickness system.  The same applies in Germany where it is also possible to opt out of SHI if you are a very high earner and into a PHI but if a person has reached the age of 55 and is in the PHI sector he or she must remain covered by PHI and cannot opt back into SHI.  Persons who are unemployed can usually continue their payments through [[social insurance]] and the very poor receive support from the government to be insured. Most workers are insured through compulsory membership of "sickness funds" that are non-profit entities established originally by [[trades unions]] and now given statutory status.  In Germany and France, as is the case with most European health care finance, the personal contribution to health care financing varies according to a person's income level and not according to their health status.  Only 0.2% of Germans are uninsured, mainly self-employed, rich and poor, and persons who have failed to pay contributions to the statutory insurance or premiums to the private health insurance. Between 1990 and 2000 the share of French SHI income coming directly from employees via salaries fell from around 30% to just 3% and employer direct contributions also fell.  The difference was made up by a rise in income from government taxation, thus widening the mandatory contribution base to the health insurance system.<ref>http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/80703/E85472.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/80694/E83126.pdf</ref>
