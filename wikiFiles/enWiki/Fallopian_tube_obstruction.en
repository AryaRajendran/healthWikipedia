'''Fallopian tube obstruction''' is a major cause of [[female infertility]]. Blocked [[fallopian tube]]s are unable to let the [[ovum]] and the [[sperm]] converge, thus making [[fertilization]] impossible. Fallopian Tubes are also known as oviducts, uterine tubes, and salpinges (singular salpinx).

==Types==
About 20% of female infertility can be attributed to tubal causes.<ref name=yen>{{cite book |author=Yen SSC, Jaffe RB, Barbieri RL |title=Reproductive Endocrinology, 4th Ed. |publisher=W. B. Saunders Co, 1999 |isbn=0-7216-6897-6}}</ref> Distal tubal occlusion (affecting the end towards the [[ovary]]) is typically associated with [[hydrosalpinx]] formation and often caused by ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''.<ref name=yen/> Pelvic adhesions may be associated with such an infection. In less severe forms, the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbriae]] may be aggluntinated and damaged, but some patency may still be preserved. Midsegment tubal obstruction can be due to tubal ligation procedures as that part of the tube is a common target of sterilization interventions. Proximal tubal occlusion can occur after infection such as a [[septic abortion]]. Also, some tubal sterilization procedures such as the [[Essure]] procedure target the part of the tube that is close to the uterus..

==Causes==
Most commonly a tube may be obstructed due to infection such as [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID). The rate of tubal infertility has been reported to be 12% after one, 23% after two, and 53% after three episodes of PID.<ref name=yen/> The Fallopian tubes may also be occluded or disabled by [[endometritis]], infections after [[childbirth]] and intraabdominal infections including [[appendicitis]] and [[peritonitis]]. The formation of adhesions may not necessarily block a fallopian tube, but render it dysfunctional by distorting or separating it from the ovary. It has been reported that women with distal tubal occlusion have a higher rate of [[HIV infection]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adesiyun AG, Ameh CA, Eka A.| title=Hysterosalpingographic tubal abnormalities and HIV infection among black women with tubal infertility in sub-Saharan Africa. |journal=Gynecol Obstet Invest. |pmid=18446041 |year=2008 |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=119–22 |doi=10.1159/000128600}}</ref>

Fallopian tubes may be blocked as a method of contraception. In these situations tubes tend to be healthy and typically patients requesting the procedure had children. [[Tubal ligation]] is considered a permanent procedure.

==Evaluation==
While a full testing of tubal functions in patients with [[infertility]] is not possible, testing of tubal patency is feasible. A [[hysterosalpingogram]] will demonstrate that tubes are open when the radioopaque dye spills into the abdominal cavity. [[Gynecologic ultrasonography|Sonography]] can demonstrate tubal abnormalities such as a [[hydrosalpinx]] indicative of tubal occlusion. During surgery, typically [[laparoscopy]], the status of the tubes can be inspected and a dye such as [[methylene blue]] can be injected in a process termed chromotubation into the uterus and shown to pass through the tubes when the cervix is occluded. Laparoscopic chromotubation has ben described as the gold standard of tubal evaluation.<ref name=coog>{{cite journal| author=Kodaman PH, Arici A, Seli E.| title=Evidence-based diagnosis and management of tubal factor infertility |journal=Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol. |pmid=15129051| year=2004| volume=16| issue=3| pages=221–9}}</ref> As tubal disease is often related to Chlamydia infection, testing for [[Chlamydia antibodies]] has become a cost-effective screening device for tubal pathology.<ref name=coog/>

[[Tubal insufflation]] is only of historical interest as an older office method to indicate patency;<ref>{{cite journal |  author=Speert H  | title=Memorable Medical Mentors: XVII: Isidor C. Rubin (1883–1958)  | journal=Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey  | volume=62 |issue= 2 |date= February 2007,  | pages=77–81 |  doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000248809.19623.96 |pmid= }}</ref> it was used prior to laparoscopic evaluation of pelvic organs.

==Treatment==
Traditionally Fallopian tubal surgery ([[tuboplasty]]) was used to restore patency to the tubes and thus possibly normal function. However, in most situations today, [[in vitro fertilization]] is used to overcome tubal infertility as it is more cost-effective, less invasive, and results are immediate. With IVF, after stimulation of ovarian follicles, egg cells are removed via a sonographic directed vaginal puncture into the ovary, these eggs are fertiized outside the body, and the resultant embryo placed transcervically into the uterus; - the tubes are bypassed in this process.

Different types of tuboplasty have been developed and can be applied by [[laparoscopy]] or [[laparotomy]]. They include lysis of adhesions, fimbrioplasty (repairing the fimbriated end of the tubes), [[salpinostomy]] (creating an opening for the tube), resection and reananstomosis (removing a piece of blocked tube and reuniting the remaining patent parts of the tube), and tubal reimplantation (reconnecting the tube to the uterus). Further, using [[fluoroscopy]] or [[hysteroscopy]] proximal tubal occlusion can be overcome by transcervical catheter recanalization<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sulak PJ, Letterie GS, Hayslip CC, Coddington CC, Klein TA.|title=Hysteroscopic cannulation and lavage in the treatment of proximal tubal occlusion |journal=Steril Fertil |pmid=2957240 |year=1987 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=493–4}}</ref> or [[falloposcopy]].

Results of tubal surgery are inversely related to damage that exists prior to surgery.<ref name=mossa>

Surgical repair of fallopian tubes that have been occluded by a sterilization procedure generally have good success rates provided enough healthy tubal tissue is present for the surgeon to perform a [[tubal reversal]].

While IVF therapy has largely replaced tubal surgery in the treatment of infertility, the presence of [[hydrosalpinx]] is a detriment to IVF success. It has been recommended that prior to IVF, laparoscopic surgery should be done to either block or remove hydrosalpinges.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Johnson N, van Voorst S, Sowter MC, Strandell A, Mol BW.|
