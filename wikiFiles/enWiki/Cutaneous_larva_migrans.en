'''Cutaneous larva migrans''' (abbreviated '''CLM''') is a skin disease in humans, caused by the larvae of various nematode [[parasite]]s of the [[hookworm]] [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Ancylostomatidae]]). The most common [[species]] causing this disease in the Americas is ''[[Ancylostoma braziliense]]''. These parasites live in the intestines of dogs, cats and wild animals and should not be confused with other members of the hookworm family for which humans are definitive [[host]]s, namely ''[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]'' and ''[[Necator americanus]]''. 

Colloquially called '''creeping eruption'''<ref name="treatment_1" /><ref name="treatment_2" /> due to its presentation, the disease is also somewhat ambiguously known as '''"[[ground itch]]"''' or (in some parts of the Southern USA) '''"[[sandworm]]s"''', as the larvae like to live in sandy soil. Another vernacular name is '''plumber's itch'''. The medical term CLM literally means "wandering larvae in the skin".

==Cause==
Hookworm eggs are shed in infected dog (or other animal) feces to the ground, where they then develop over a period of 1-2 weeks into the infectious larval form (filariform larvae).<ref name="CDC" /> The filariform larvae can burrow through intact skin that comes into contact with soil or sand that is contaminated with feces. Although they are able to infect the deeper tissues of animals (through to the lungs and then the intestinal tract), humans are incidental [[host]]s and the larvae are only able to penetrate the upper dermis of the [[skin]]<ref name="treatment_1" /> and thus create the typical wormlike burrows visible underneath the skin. These parasites apparently lack the collagenase [[enzyme]]s required to penetrate through the [[basement membrane]] deeper into the skin.

==Presentation==
The infection causes a red, intensely pruritic (itchy) eruption. The itching can become very painful and if scratched may allow a secondary bacterial infection to develop. Cutaneous larva migrans usually heals spontaneously over weeks to months and has been known to last as long as one year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chaudhry|first=AZ|coauthors=Lonworth DL|title=Cutaneous manifestations of intestinal helminthic infections.|journal=Dermatol Clin|year=1989|volume=7|pages=275–90}}</ref> However, the severity of the symptoms usually causes those infected to seek medical treatment before spontaneous resolution occurs. Following proper treatment, migration of the larvae within the skin is halted and relief of the associated itching can occur in less than 48 hours (reported for thiabendazole).<ref name="treatment_1" />

==Treatment and Prevention==
CLM can be treated in a number of different ways:

* Systemic (oral) agents include [[albendazole]]<ref name="treatment_1">{{cite journal|last=Caumes|first=E.|title=Treatment of Cutaneous Larva Migrans|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=1 May 2000|year=2000|volume=30|issue=5|pages=811–814|doi=10.1086/313787|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/5/811.full}}</ref><ref name="treatment_2">{{cite journal|last=Albanese|first=G|coauthors=Caterina Venturi, and Giuseppe Galbiati|title=Treatment of larva migrans cutanea (creeping eruption): a comparison between albendazole and traditional therapy|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|year=2001|volume=40|pages=67-71}}</ref>   (trade name ''Albenza'')<ref>{{cite web|last=Drugs.com|title=Albenza|url=http://www.drugs.com/search.php?searchterm=Albenza|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>  and [[ivermectin]]<ref name="treatment_1" /> (trade name ''Stromectol''))<ref>{{cite web|last=Drugs.com|title=Stromectol|url=http://www.drugs.com/search.php?searchterm=Stromectol|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>.

* Another agent which can be applied either topically ''or'' taken by mouth is [[thiabendazole]]<ref name="treatment_1" /><ref name="treatment_2" /> (trade name ''Mintezol''))<ref>{{cite web|last=Drugs.com|title=Mintezol|url=http://www.drugs.com/search.php?searchterm=Mintezol|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>, an [[Anthelmintic|anti-helminthic]]. When taken orally, this medication is known to cause nausea. A topical preparation can be made by mixing the ground pills in vaseline. This mixture can be spread lightly on the lesion and held in place with a plaster. This produces local tissue levels sufficient to kill the parasite without the systemic side effects when taken orally.

* Topical freezing agents, such as [[ethylene chloride]] or [[liquid nitrogen]]<ref name="treatment_1" />, applied locally can freeze and kill the larvae, but this method has a high failure rate due to the fact that the larvae are usually located away from the site of the visible skin trails. Additionally, this is a painful method which can cause blistering and/or ulceration of the skin and it is therefore not recommended<ref name="treatment_1" />.

*It is recommended to use Benadryl or some anti-itch cream (i.e. Cortizone or Calamine lotion). This will help relieve some of the itch.

*Wearing shoes in areas where these parasites are known to be endemic offers protection from infection.<ref name="treatment_1" /> In general, avoiding exposure of skin to contaminated soil or sand offers the best protection. In some areas dogs have been banned from beaches in an attempt to control human infection.<ref name="treatment_1" />
