'''Phossy jaw''', formally '''phosphorus necrosis of the jaw''', is an [[occupational disease]] of those who work with [[Allotropes of phosphorus#White phosphorus|white phosphorus]], also known as ''yellow phosphorus'', without proper safeguards. It was most commonly seen in workers in the [[match]] industry in the 19th and early 20th century. Modern [[occupational hygiene]] practices have eliminated the working conditions which caused this disease.

==Symptoms and treatment==
Those with phossy jaw would begin suffering painful [[toothache]]s and swelling of the [[gingiva|gums]]. Over time, the jaw bone would begin to [[abscess]]. Affected bones would glow a greenish-white colour in the dark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osh.govt.nz/kidz/gore/jphossy.shtml|title=Workshops of Horror|publisher=New Zealand Department of Labour}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://medgenmed.medscape.com/viewarticle/538223_print|title=Bisphosphonates and jaw osteonecrosis |publisher=Medscape|author=Zosia Chustecka|year=2005}}</ref> It also caused serious brain damage. Surgical removal of the afflicted jaw bones could save the patient; otherwise, death from [[organ failure]] would follow.  The disease was extremely painful and disfiguring to the patient, with dying bone tissue rotting away accompanied by a foul-smelling [[Mucopurulent discharge|discharge]].

==Match industry==
White phosphorus was the active ingredient of most matches from the 1840s to the 1910s and exposure to the vapour from this caused a deposition of phosphorus in the [[jaw]] [[bone]]s<ref name="pmid18940506">{{cite journal|author=Marx RE|title=Uncovering the cause of "phossy jaw" Circa 1858 to 1906: oral and maxillofacial surgery closed case files-case closed|journal=[[J.

Concern over phossy jaw contributed to the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]], and although this strike did not end the use of white phosphorus, [[William Booth]] and the [[Salvation Army]] opened a match-making factory in 1891 which used the much safer, though more expensive, [[red phosphorus]].<ref name="SA">[http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_60859.html Fact and Fiction]</ref> The Salvation Army also campaigned with local retailers to get them to sell only red phosphorus matches.<ref name="SA"/>

However it was not until the use of white phosphorus was prohibited by the international [[Berne Convention (1906)|Berne Convention]] in 1906, and these provisions were implemented in national laws over the next few years, that industrial use ceased.<ref name="Flanders">[http://www.rootsweb.com/~belghist/Flanders/Pages/phossy.htm Phossy jaw]</ref> 

==Links to bisphosphonates==
A related condition, [[Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw]] ('''BON'''), has been described as a side-effect of [[bisphosphonate|amino-bisphosphonate]]s, a class of phosphorus-based drugs that inhibit bone resorption, and are used widely for treating [[osteoporosis]], bone disease in [[cancer]] and some other conditions.<ref name="pmid16000365">{{cite journal

'''BON''' is primarily associated with the use of [[intravenous]] bisphosphonates in the treatment of cancer. The percentage incidence of '''BON''' from this use is approximately 1000 times higher than the incidence of BON caused by the use of oral bisphosphonates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cartsos VM, Zhu S, Zavras AI |title=Bisphosphonate use and the risk of adverse jaw outcomes: a medical claims study of 714,217 people |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18167381 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18167381}}</ref>
