==The deep-space radiation environment==
The radiation environment of deep space is very different from that on the Earth's surface or in [[low earth orbit]], due to the much larger flux of high-energy [[galactic cosmic rays]] (GCRs), along with radiation from [[solar proton event]]s (SPEs) and the [[radiation belt]]s.

Galactic cosmic rays create a continuous radiation dose throughout the solar system that increases during solar minimum and decreases during solar maximum ([[Solar variation|solar activity]]).  The inner and outer radiation belts are two regions of trapped particles from the solar wind that are later accelerated by dynamic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field.  While always high, the radiation dose in these belts can increase dramatically during [[geomagnetic storms]] and [[substorm]]s.  Solar proton events are bursts of energetic protons accelerated by the sun. They occur relatively rarely and can produce extremely high radiation levels. Without thick shielding, SPEs are sufficiently strong to cause acute [[radiation poisoning]] and death.<ref>Biomedical Results From Apollo - Radiation Protection and Instrumentation;[http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S2ch3.htm]</ref>

Life on the Earth's surface is protected from galactic cosmic rays by a number of factors:
# The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to primary cosmic rays with energies below about 1 GeV, so only secondary radiation can reach the surface. The secondary radiation is also attenuated by absorption in the atmosphere, as well as by radioactive decay in flight of some particles, such as muons.  Particles entering from a direction close to the horizon are especially attenuated.  The world's population receives an average of 0.4 milli-[[Sievert]]s (mSv) of cosmic radiation annually (separate from other sources of radiation exposure like inhaled radon) due to atmospheric shielding.  At 15&nbsp;km altitude, above most of the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere's]] protection, radiation dose as an annual rate rises to 20 [[Sievert|mSv]] at the equator to 50 - 120 mSv at the poles, varying between solar maximum and minimum conditions<ref>[http://cordis.europa.eu/documents/documentlibrary/75331981EN6.pdf Evaluation of the Cosmic Ray Exposure of Aircraft Crew]</ref><ref>[http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation, UNSCEAR 2008]</ref>
# Except for the very highest energy galactic cosmic rays, the [[Gyroradius|radius of gyration]] in the [[earth's magnetic field]] is small enough to ensure that they are deflected away from Earth. Missions beyond low earth orbit leave the protection of the geomagnetic field, and transit the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.  Thus they may need to be shielded against exposure to [[cosmic rays]], Van Allen radiation, or [[solar flare]]s. The region between two to four earth radii lies between the two radiation belts and is sometimes referred to as the "safe zone".<ref>{{cite web

# The [[interplanetary magnetic field]], embedded in the [[solar wind]], also deflects cosmic rays.   As a result, cosmic ray fluxes within the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] are inversely correlated with the [[solar cycle]].<ref>[http://www.srl.caltech.edu/personnel/dick/cos_encyc.html Cosmic Rays by R. A. Mewaldt;]</ref>

As a result, the energy input of [[GCRs]] to the atmosphere is negligible — about 10<sup>−9</sup> of [[solar radiation]] - roughly the same as starlight.<ref name=CRC>'''Jasper Kirkby'''; [http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1938v1 Cosmic Rays And Climate] CERN-PH-EP/2008-005 26 March 2008</ref>

Of the above factors, all but the first one apply to [[low earth orbit]] craft, such as the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]].  Exposures on the [[International Space Station|ISS]] average 150 mSv per year, although frequent crew rotations minimize individual risk.<ref name = historicalexposure>[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070010704_2007005310.pdf Space Radiation Organ Doses for Astronauts on Past and Future Missions] Table 4</ref> Astronauts on [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Skylab]] missions received on average 1.2 mSv/day and 1.4 mSv/day respectively.<ref name = historicalexposure/>  Since the durations of the Apollo and Skylab missions were days and months, respectively, rather than years, the doses involved were smaller than would be expected on future long-term missions such as to a near-Earth asteroid or to Mars (unless far more shielding could be provided).

==Human health effects==
The potential acute and chronic health effects of space radiation, as with other ionizing radiation exposures, involve both direct damage to DNA and indirect effects due to generation of reactive oxygen species. Acute (or early radiation) effects result from high radiation doses, and these are most likely to occur after solar particle events (SPEs).<ref name="THREE - Acute Effects">{{cite web|last=Seed|first=Thomas|title=Acute Effects|url=http://three.usra.edu/articles/SeedAcuteEffects.pdf|work=The Health Effects of Extraterrestrial Environments|publisher=Universities Space Research Association, Division of Space Life Sciences|accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Likely chronic effects of space radiation exposure include both stochastic events such as radiation [[carcinogenesis]] <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cucinotta|first=F.A.|coauthors=Durante, M.|title=Cancer risk from exposure to galactic cosmic rays: implications for space exploration by human beings|journal=Lancet Oncol.|year=2006|volume=7|pages=431–435}}</ref> and deterministic degenerative tissue effects.  To date, however, the only pathology associated with space radiation exposure is a higher risk for [[Cataract#Radiation|radiation cataract]] among the astronaut corps.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cucinotta|first=F.A.|coauthors=Manuel, F.K., Jones, J., Iszard, G., Murrey, J., Djojonegro, B. and Wear, M.|title=Space radiation and cataracts in astronauts.|journal=Rad. Res.|year=2001|volume=156|pages=460–466}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rastegar|first=Z.N.|coauthors=Eckart, P. and Mertz M.|title=Radiation cataracts in astronauts and cosmonauts|journal=Graefe. Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol|year=2002|volume=240|pages=543–547}}</ref>

The health threat depends on the flux, energy spectrum, and nuclear composition of the radiation. The flux and energy spectrum depend on a variety of factors: short-term solar weather, long-term trends (such as an apparent increase since the 1950s<ref name="icrc2005.tifr.res.in">[http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/DATA/bibliography/ICRC2005/usa-mewaldt-RA-abs1-sh35-oral.pdf  The Cosmic Ray Radiation Dose in Interplanetary Space – Present Day and Worst-Case Evaluations] R.A. Mewaldt et al., page 103, 29th International Cosmic Ray Conference Pune (2005) 00, 101-104</ref>), and position in the sun's magnetic field. These factors are incompletely understood.
The [[Mars Radiation Environment Experiment]] (MARIE) was launched in 2001 in order to collect more data.
Estimates are that humans unshielded in interplanetary space would receive annually roughly 400 to 900 milli[[Sievert]]s (mSv) (compared to 2.4 mSv on Earth) and that a Mars mission (12 months in flight and 18 months on Mars) might expose shielded astronauts to ~500 to 1000 mSv.<ref name="icrc2005.tifr.res.in"/> These doses approach the 1 to 4 Sv career limits advised by the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] for [[Low Earth orbit]] activities.

The quantitative biological effects of cosmic rays are poorly known, and are the subject of ongoing research. Several experiments, both in space and on Earth, are being carried out to evaluate the exact degree of danger.
Recent{{when|date=October 2012}} experiments at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]'s [[NSRL|NASA Space Radiation Laboratory]] (NSRL) suggest that  biological damage due to a given exposure is actually about half what was previously estimated: specifically, it turns out that low energy protons cause more damage than high energy ones.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This is explained by the fact that slower particles have more time to interact with molecules in the body.

=== Central nervous system ===
Potential early and late effects on the central nervous system are of great concern to NASA and an area of active current research interest. Both short and long term effects of CNS exposure to [[galactic cosmic radiation]] (GCR) are likely to pose significant neurological health risks to human long-term space travel.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vazquez|first=M.E.|title=Neurobiological problems in long-term deep space flights|journal=Adv.

==Mitigation==
===Shielding===
Material shielding can be effective against galactic cosmic rays, but thin shielding may situationally actually make the problem worse for some of the higher energy rays, because more shielding causes an increased amount of secondary radiation, although very (arguably impractical) thick shielding could counter such too.<ref name = mass_shielding>NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix E Mass Shielding] Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref> The aluminum walls of the ISS, for example, are believed to have a net beneficial effect. In interplanetary space, however, it is believed that thin aluminum shielding would have a negative net effect.<ref name="islandone.org">[http://www.islandone.org/Settlements/MagShield.html Magnetic Radiation Shielding: An Idea Whose Time Has Returned? - G.Landis (1991)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Several strategies are being studied for ameliorating the effects of this radiation hazard for planned human interplanetary spaceflight:
* Spacecraft can be constructed out of hydrogen-rich plastics, rather than aluminum.<ref>[http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/25aug_plasticspaceships.htm NASA - Plastic Spaceships<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Unfortunately, "[S]ome 'galactic cosmic rays are so energetic that no reasonable amount of shielding can stop them,' cautions Frank Cucinotta, NASA's Chief Radiation Health Officer. 'All materials have this problem, including polyethylene.'"<ref name = newscientist>[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7753 Cosmic rays may prevent long-haul space travel - space - 1 August 2005 - New Scientist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* Material shielding has been considered:
** Liquid hydrogen, which would be brought along as fuel in any case, tends to give relatively good shielding, while producing relatively low levels of secondary radiation. Therefore, the fuel could be placed so as to act as a form of shielding around the crew. However, as fuel is consumed by the craft, the crew's shielding decreases.
** Water, which is necessary to sustain life, could also contribute to shielding. But it too is consumed during the journey unless waste products are utilized.<ref name = newscientist/>
** Asteroids could serve to provide shielding.<ref>Morgan, P. (2011) [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2011/02/11/to-hitch-a-ride-to-mars-just-flag-down-an-asteroid/ "To Hitch a Ride to Mars, Just Flag Down an Asteroid"] ''Discover'' magazine blog</ref><ref>Matloff, G.L. and Wilga, M. (2011) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.02.026 "NEOs as stepping stones to Mars and main-belt asteroids"] ''Acta Astronautica'' '''68'''(5-6):599-602</ref>
* Magnetic deflection of charged radiation particles and/or electrostatic repulsion is a hypothetical alternative to pure conventional mass shielding under investigation.  In theory, power requirements for the case of a 5 meter torus drop from an excessive 10 [[Gigawatt|GW]] for a simple pure electrostatic shield (too discharged by space electrons) to a moderate 10 [[Kilowatt|kW]] by using a hybrid design.<ref name="islandone.org"/>  However, such complex active shielding is untried, with workability and practicalities more uncertain than material shielding.<ref name="islandone.org"/>

Special provisions would also be necessary to protect against a solar proton event (SPE), which could increase fluxes to levels that would kill a crew in hours or days rather than months or years.  Potential mitigation strategies include providing a small habitable space behind a spacecraft's water supply or with particularly thick walls or providing an option to abort to the protective environment provided by the Earth's magnetosphere.  The Apollo mission used a combination of both strategies.  Upon receiving confirmation of an SPE, astronauts would move to the Command Module, which had thicker aluminum walls than the Lunar Module, then return to Earth.  It was later determined from measurements taken by instruments flown on Apollo that the Command Module would have provided sufficient shielding to prevent significant crew harm.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

None of these strategies currently provides a method of protection that would be known to be sufficient{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} while conforming to likely limitations on the mass of the payload at present (~ $10000/kg) launch prices.  Scientists such as University of Chicago professor emeritus Eugene Parker are not optimistic it can be solved any time soon.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  For passive mass shielding, the required amount could be too heavy to be affordably lifted into space without changes in economics (like hypothetical [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] or usage of extraterrestrial resources) — many hundreds of metric tons for a reasonably-sized crew compartment.  For instance, a NASA design study for an ambitious large spacestation envisioned 4 metric tons per square meter of shielding to drop radiation exposure to 2.5 [[Sievert#Yearly dose examples|mSv]] annually (+/- a factor of 2 uncertainty), less than the tens of mSv or more in some populated [[Background Radiation#Natural background radiation|high natural background radiation areas]] on Earth, but the sheer mass for that level of mitigation was considered practical only because it involved first building a lunar [[mass driver]] to launch material.<ref name = mass_shielding/>

Several active shielding methods have been considered for lesser mass than passive mass shielding, but they remain in the realm of uncertain speculation at the present time.<ref name="islandone.org"/><ref>[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/docs/ToMaSS.pdf Simulations of Magnetic Shields for Spacecraft]. Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref> Since the segment of space radiation penetrating farthest through thick material shielding, deep in interplanetary space, is GeV-level positively charged nuclei, a repulsive positively charged electrostatic shield has been hypothesized, but issues include plasma instabilities and power needs for an accelerator constantly keeping the charge from being neutralized by deep-space electrons.<ref>NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/4appendD.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix D The Plasma Core Shield] Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref>  A more common proposal is magnetic shielding using superconductors (or plasma currents), although, among other complications, if designing a relatively compact system, magnetic fields up to 10-20 Tesla could be required around a manned spacecraft higher than the several Tesla in [[MRI]] machines. The employment of magnetic structures which expose crew to such a high magnetic field may further complicate matters, though, since high-field (5 Tesla or more) MRIs have been noted to produce headaches and migraines in MRI patients, and high-duration exposure to such fields has not been studied.  Opposing-electromagnet designs might cancel the field in the crew sections of the spacecraft, but such would raise mass.  A hybrid of an electrostatic shield and a magnetic shield has also been conceived, charge neutral at large distances and theoretically much reducing the individual weaknesses of each, yet complex to design if doable.<ref name="islandone.org"/>

Part of the uncertainty is that the effect of human exposure to galactic cosmic rays is poorly known in quantitative terms. The [[NASA Space Radiation Laboratory]] is currently studying the effects of radiation in living organisms as well as protective shielding.

===Drugs===
Another line of research is the development of drugs that mimic and/or enhance the body's natural capacity to repair damage caused by radiation. Some of the drugs that are being considered are [[retinoids]], which are [[vitamins]] with [[antioxidant]] properties, and molecules that retard cell division, giving the body time to fix damage before harmful mutations can be duplicated.

===Timing of missions===

Due to the potential negative effects of astronaut exposure to cosmic rays, solar activity may play a role in future space travel. Because galactic cosmic ray fluxes within the solar system are lower during periods of strong [[Solar variation|solar activity]], interplanetary travel during solar maximum should minimize the average dose to astronauts.

Although the [[Forbush decrease]] effect during [[Coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs) can temporarily lower the flux of galactic cosmic rays, the short duration of the effect (1–3 days) and the approximately 1% chance that a CME generates a dangerous [[solar proton event]] limits the utility of timing missions to coincide with CMEs.

===Orbital selection===

Radiation dosage from the Earth's radiation belts is typically mitigated by selecting orbits that avoid the belts or pass through them relatively quickly.  For example, a [[Low Earth orbit]], with low inclination, will generally be below the inner belt.

The orbit of the Earth-Moon system [[Lagrange Points]] {{L2}} - {{L5}} takes them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time.

The orbits of Earth-Sun system Lagrange Points {{L1}} and {{L3}} - {{L5}} are always outside of the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere.
