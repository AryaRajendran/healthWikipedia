In [[medicine]], a '''prodrome''' is an early [[symptom]] (or set of symptoms) that might indicate the start of a [[disease]] before specific symptoms occur.  It is derived from the Greek word ''prodromos'' or ''precursor''. Prodromes may be [[non-specific symptoms]] or, in a few instances, may clearly indicate a particular disease, such as the prodromal [[migraine aura]].  

For example fever, [[malaise]], headache and lack of appetite frequently occur in the prodrome of many infective disorders.  A prodrome can be the precursor to the onset of a chronic [[neurological]] disorder such as [[migraine]] or [[epilepsy]], where prodrome symptoms include euphoria, [[scotoma]], disorientation, [[aphasia]], or photosensitivity.

It also refers to the initial ''[[in vivo]]'' round of viral replication.

[[Pre-labor|Prodromal labour]], mistakenly called "false labour," refers to the early signs before labour starts.

A prodrome for [[schizophrenia]] is the period of decreased functioning that is postulated to correlate with the onset of psychotic symptoms.  The concept has been reconsidered as the pathways to emerging psychosis have been investigated since the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yung AR, McGorry PD, McFarlane CA, Jackson HJ, Patton GC, Rakkar A |title=Monitoring and care of young people at incipient risk of psychosis |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=283–303 |year=1996 |pmid=8782287 |doi= 10.1093/schbul/22.2.283|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8782287}}</ref> One example of the international paradigms aimed at researching the prodrome is the [http://napls.psych.ucla.edu/ North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS)]. This study is concerned with brain development, hormones, and neuropsychological functions that may play a role in risk for and prevention of mental illness in young adulthood. The term [[at risk mental state]] is sometimes preferred, as a prodromal period cannot be confirmed unless the emergence of the condition has occurred. (Also see [[early intervention in psychosis|early psychosis]].)

Prodrome, or '''psychosis risk syndrome''' as it is also known, is a proposed syndrome to be used in the ''[[DSM-5|DSM-V]]'' (2013) of [[psychiatry]].<ref>William Carpenter, ''Report of the DSM-5 Psychotic Disorders Work Group'', April 2009, found at [http://www.dsm5.org/progressreports/pages/0904reportofthedsm-vpsychoticdisordersworkgroup.aspx DSM-5 website] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

About one third of patients with prodrome are diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] or other [[psychosis]] in a few years.  In the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study, researchers found that 35 percent of "patients had a psychotic break within two and a half years of enrolling at a clinic."<ref name=Aviv />  65 percent "found that their symptoms passed or plateaued."<ref name=Aviv />  A psychotic break is made statistically more likely (43% vs. 35%) if the patient [[drug abuse|abuses certain drugs]].<ref name=Aviv />

==Prodromal phase of common diseases and conditions==
*[[Measles]] - Marked by [[fever]], [[rhinorrhea]], and [[conjuctivitis]].
*[[Chickenpox|Varicella]] - May or may not feature a prodrome, but at least 37% of unvaccinated children who contract chickenpox do have at ''least'' a mild febrile prodrome.
*[[Migraine#Prodrome|Migraine]] - Not always present, and varies from individual to individual, but can include altered mood, irritability, [[clinical depression|depression]] or [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[yawning]], excessive sleepiness, craving for certain food (e.g. [[chocolate]]), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), hot ears, constipation or diarrhea, increased urination, and other visceral symptoms.<ref name="pmid15447695">{{Cite journal|author=Kelman L |title=The premonitory symptoms (prodrome): a tertiary care study of 893 migraineurs |journal=Headache |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=865–72 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15447695 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2004.04168.x}}</ref>
*[[Herpes simplex]] - Marked by tingling ([[paresthesia]]), itching, and pain.
*[[Diverticulitis]] - May worsen throughout the first day, as it starts out as small pains in the torso and/or mild [[diarrhea]], and may slowly turn into vomiting and sharp pains in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen.
