== Whistleblower ==
Kruszewski is a three-time successful [[whistleblower]], with settlements from suits brought against Southwood Psychiatric Hospital, Pfizer, Inc., and AstraZeneca. Kruszewski became aware of inadequate care and the exploiting of state-committed mentally ill children through overmedication and physical and [[chemical restraint]]s while working for the Department of Public Welfare, Bureau of Program Integrity for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. When he refused to keep silent about his discoveries, he was fired from his position at the state.<ref>Stefan P. Kruszewski v Pfizer Inc., et al.

He also demonstrated problems with off-label marketing (marketing that promotes uses, patients or doses that are not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]) which resulted in heightened, but often non-transparent, risk to the health of patients and exceptional costs to taxpayers and state and federal governments.<ref name="Woolner" /><ref name="Howard" /><ref name="DrugDisc" /><ref name="Deming" />
