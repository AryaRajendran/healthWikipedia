'''Empty calories''', in casual [[dietary]] terminology, are a measure of the digestible [[Food energy|energy]] present in high-energy foods with little [[nutrition]]al value, typically processed [[carbohydrate]]s and [[ethanol]] (alcohol), and to some extent [[fat]]s.  Also known as a discretionary calorie, an "empty calorie" has the same energy content as any other calorie but lacks many accompanying [[nutrient]]s such as [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, [[amino acid]]s, or [[dietary fiber]]. Although carbohydrates and fats are nutrients, they are typically ignored for this analysis, with the exception of [[essential fatty acid]]s.

All people require certain essential nutrients, but caloric intake must be balanced with activity to maintain a proper [[body weight]]. People who engage in heavy physical activity need calories as fuel, which can be supplied by empty calories in addition to foods with essential nutrients. [[Sedentary lifestyle|Sedentary]] individuals and those [[Dieting|eating less to lose weight]] may suffer malnutrition if they eat food supplying empty calories but not enough nutrients.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/calories/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/healthieryou/html/chapter6.html#2</ref> [[Dietitian]]s and nutritionists prevent or treat illnesses by designing eating programs and recommending dietary modifications according to patients' needs.<ref>http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos077.htm {{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> Eating a variety of nutritious foods every day protects against chronic illness and helps to maintain a healthy immune system.<ref>[http://www.eatright.org/Public/content.aspx?id=5554 American Dietetic Association]</ref>
