'''Morning sickness''', also called '''nausea gravidarum''', '''[[nausea]]''', '''[[vomiting]] of [[pregnancy]]''' ('''emesis gravidarum''' or '''NVP'''), or '''pregnancy sickness''' is a condition that affects more than half of all pregnant [[women]]. Sometimes symptoms are present in the early hours of the morning and reduce as the day progresses. However, in spite of its common name, it can occur at any time of the day. For most women it may stop around the 12th week of pregnancy.

Related to increased [[estrogen]] levels, a similar form of nausea is also seen in some women who use [[hormonal contraception]] or [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]].  The nausea can be mild or induce actual vomiting, however, not severe enough to cause metabolic derangement. In more severe cases, vomiting may cause [[dehydration]], weight loss, [[alkalosis]] and [[hypokalemia]]. This condition is known as [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] and occurs in about 1% of all pregnancies. Nausea and vomiting can be one of the first signs of pregnancy and usually begins around the 6th week of pregnancy (counting [[gestational age]] from 14 days before conception).

==Causes==
[[File:Morning sickness.svg|thumb|300px|Morning sickness]]
[[Proximate and ultimate causation|Proximate cause]]s of pregnancy sickness include:

* An increase in the circulating level of the [[hormone]] [[estrogen]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lagiou|first=P|coauthors=Tamimi, R; Mucci, LA; Trichopoulos, D; Adami, HO; Hsieh, CC|title=Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in relation to prolactin, estrogens, and progesterone: a prospective study.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=2003 Apr|volume=101|issue=4|pages=639–44|pmid=12681864|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>  However, there is no consistent evidence of differences in estrogen levels and levels of [[bilirubin]] between women that experience sickness and those that do not.<ref>n

* Low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]) due to the [[placenta]]'s draining energy from the mother, though studies have not confirmed this.<ref>

* An increase in [[progesterone]] relaxes the [[muscle]]s in the [[uterus]], which prevents early [[childbirth]], but may also relax the [[stomach]] and [[intestine]]s, leading to excess [[stomach acid]]s and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].
* An increase in [[human chorionic gonadotropin]]. It is probably not the human chorionic gonadotropin itself that causes the nausea. More likely, it is the human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulating the maternal ovaries to secrete estrogen, which in turn causes the nausea.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1003896 | last1 = Niebyl | first1 = Jennifer R. | year = 2010| title = Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 16| pages = 1544–1550 | pmid = 20942670 }}</ref>
* An increase in [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to [[odor]]s, which overstimulates normal nausea triggers.
* An increase in bilirubin levels due to increased liver enzymes.

Note that [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] can also be caused by pregnancy, and may result in nausea and vomiting.

==Morning sickness as a defense mechanism==
Morning sickness is believed to be an [[natural selection|evolved trait]] that protects the fetus against [[toxin]]s ingested by the mother.<ref>{{Cite book

In the fetus, these defenses are not yet fully developed, and even small doses of plant toxins that have negligible effects on the adult can be harmful or lethal to the embryo.<ref name="Beck">{{cite book

* Morning sickness is very common among pregnant women, which argues in favor of its being a functional adaptation and against the idea that it is a [[pathology]].
* Fetal vulnerability to toxins peaks at around 3 months, which is also the time of peak susceptibility to morning sickness.
* There is a good correlation between toxin concentrations in foods, and the tastes and odors that cause revulsion.

Women who have ''no'' morning sickness are more likely to [[miscarriage|miscarry]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ronna L. et al. | last2 = Olshan | first2 = A.

If morning sickness is a defense mechanism against the ingestion of toxins, the prescribing of [[anti-nausea drugs|anti-nausea medication]] to pregnant women may have the undesired [[side effect]] of causing birth defects or miscarriages by encouraging harmful dietary choices.<ref name="Nesse"/> On the other hand, many domestic vegetables have been purposely [[plant breeding|bred]] to have lower levels of toxins than in the distant past, and so the level of threat to the embryo may not be as high as it was when the defense mechanism first evolved.<ref>{{cite journal

==Treatments==
There is no evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of home treatments and a lack of high quality evidence generally regarding the treatment of morning sickness.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Matthews A, Dowswell T, Haas DM, Doyle M, O'Mathúna DP |title= Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2010 |issue=9 |pages= CD007575 |year=2010 |pmid= 20824863 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007575.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD007575/frame.html |editor1-last= Matthews |editor1-first= Anne}}</ref>

===Medications===
A number of [[antiemetic]]s are effective and safe in pregnancy including: [[pyridoxine/doxylamine]], [[antihistamines]] (such as [[diphenhydramine]]), and [[phenothiazines]] (such as [[promethazine]]).<ref name=BMJ2011>{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=S|coauthors=Nelson-Piercy, C|title=Management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2011 Jun 17|volume=342|pages=d3606|pmid=21685438}}</ref> With respect to effectiveness it is unknown if one is superior to another.<ref name=BMJ2011/> In the [http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm347087.htm United States] and [http://webprod5.hc-sc.gc.ca/dpd-bdpp/dispatch-repartition.do?lang=eng Canada], the doxylamine-pyridoxine combination (as Diclegis in US and Diclectin in Canada) is the only approved Pregnancy Category "A" prescription treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

==History==

===Thalidomide===
{{further|Thalidomide}}
[[Thalidomide]] was originally developed and prescribed as a cure for morning sickness in [[West Germany]], but its use was discontinued when it was found to cause [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s. The [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] never approved thalidomide for use as a cure for morning sickness.
