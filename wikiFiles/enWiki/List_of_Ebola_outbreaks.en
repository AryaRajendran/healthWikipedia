'''[[Ebola]] outbreaks''' have been restricted to Africa, with the exception of [[Reston ebolavirus]]. The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] currently recognizes four species of the Ebola: Zaire virus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), and Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_filov.htm|title=Filoviridae|accessdate=2009-10-04|last1=Netesov|first1=SV|last2=Feldmann|first2=H|last3=Jahrling|first3=PB|last4=Kiley|first4=MP|last5=Klenk|first5=H-D|last6=Sanchez|first6=A|date=2004-04-24|publisher=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses}}</ref> One additional species or type of Ebola is often recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as ''Bundibugyo ebolavirus'' or'' Ebola-Bundibugyo'', following the outbreak in Uganda in 2007.<ref name="PMID19023410" /><ref name="UNN-ID24862">{{Cite news|title=Uganda: Deadly Ebola Outbreak Confirmed - UN|url=http://www0.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24862|work=UN News Service|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref><ref name="WHO-PR20080220">{{Cite press release|title=End of Ebola outbreak in Uganda|publisher=World Health Organization|date=2008-02-20|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_02_20b/en/index.html|accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref> 

Transmission between natural reservoirs and humans is rare, and outbreaks are often traceable to a single [[index case]] where an individual has handled the carcass of a [[gorilla]], [[chimpanzee]], or [[duiker]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|15078595}}</ref> The virus then spreads person-to-person, especially within families, hospitals, and during some [[mortuary]] rituals where contact among individuals becomes more likely.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Questions and Answers about Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/ebola/qa.htm|accessdate=2009-05-31|date=2009-03-25|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> Before outbreaks are confirmed in areas of weak surveillance on the local or regional levels, Ebola is often mistaken for [[malaria]], [[typhoid fever]], [[dysentery]], [[influenza]], or various [[bacteria|bacterial infections]] which may be endemic to the region. Learning from failed responses, such as that to the 2000 Uganda outbreak, public health measures including the WHO's Global Outbreak and Response Network were instituted in areas at high risk. Field laboratories were established in order to confirm cases, instead of shipping samples to South Africa.<ref name="10.1371/journal.pmed.0010059">{{Cite doi|10.1371/journal.pmed.0010059}}</ref>

The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] Special Pathogens Branch charter to study highly infectious viruses, many causing hemorrhagic fevers, has historically endowed it to closely follow Ebola outbreaks.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/whoweare.htm|title=Mission Statement|date=2007-10-31|publisher=National Center for Infectious Diseases & Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> Compiling scientific journals and public health announcements, the following list is from [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/ebola/ebolatable.pdf Known Cases and Outbreaks of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, in Chronological Order]:<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/ebola/ebolatable.htm|title=Known Cases and Outbreaks of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, in Chronological Order |date=2009-08-26|publisher=National Center for Infectious Diseases & Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>
