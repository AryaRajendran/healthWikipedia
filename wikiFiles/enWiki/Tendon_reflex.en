'''Tendon reflex''' (or '''T-reflex''') may refer to:
*A [[stretch reflex]], when the stretch is created by a blow upon a muscle tendon. This is the usual definition of the term. <ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/tendon+reflex TheFreeDictionary > tendon reflex] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. 2007</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tendon+reflex dictionary.com > tendon  reflex] Citing: Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, 2007 and The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary 2002 </ref>  A common example is the standard knee-jerk response when visiting the doctor. <ref>[http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/mother/reflex.html wustl.edu > tendon reflex] Citing: wustl.edu. REFLEXES: Tendon & Other. 2008.</ref> '''Deep tendon reflex''' also usually refers to this sense.  A deep tendon reflex is often associated with muscle stretching.  <ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/deep+tendon+reflex TheFreeDictionary.com > deep tendon reflex] Citing: The American Heritage Medical Dictionary, 2007 and Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition, 2009</ref>  Tendon reflex tests are used to determine the integrity of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system, and they can be used to detect the presence of a neuromuscular disease.  <ref>[http://www.enotes.com/reflex-tests-reference/reflex-tests-172354 eNotes > tendon reflex] Citing: Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health. 2002</ref>
*The [[Golgi tendon reflex]], motivated by that the sensory receptors for this reflex are anatomically located in the tendon, while the sensory receptors for the stretch reflex are actually inside the proper muscle.
==Testing==
To test the reflex, tap on the [[tendon]]. In a healthy individual the intensity on both sides is equal. This means that the connections between the [[spinal cord]] and the muscles are undamaged. <ref>Batavia , Mitchell, and Andrew McDonough. "Demonstrating the Stretch Reflex: A Mechanical Model." National Associations of Biology Teachers 62.7 (2000): 503-507. JSTOR. Web. 9 Dec. 2011. </ref>

==Functions of Tendon Reflex==
The tendon reflex is a response to extensive tension on a tendon.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. Dubuque: McGraw-Hill, 2012. Print.1</ref>It helps avoid strong muscle contractions which could tear the tendon from either the muscle or bone.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. Dubuque: McGraw-Hill, 2012. Print.1</ref> In sports, quick movements can damage the tendon before the reflex can occur. .<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. Dubuque: McGraw-Hill, 2012. Print.1</ref>The tendon reflex also helps spread the workload more evenly over the entire muscle by preventing “muscle fibers connected with overstiumlated tendon organs so that their contraction is more comparable to the contraction of the rest of the muscle.”<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. Dubuque: McGraw-Hill, 2012. Print.1</ref>
