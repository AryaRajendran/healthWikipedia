In [[pharmacology]], the '''fibrates''' are a class of [[Amphiphile|amphipathic]] [[carboxylic acid]]s. They are used for a range of [[metabolism|metabolic]] disorders, mainly [[hypercholesterolemia]] (high [[cholesterol]]), and are therefore [[hypolipidemic agent]]s.

== Members ==
Fibrates prescribed commonly are:
* [[Bezafibrate]] (e.g. Bezalip)
* [[Ciprofibrate]] (e.g. Modalim)
* [[Clofibrate]] (largely obsolete due to side-effect profile, e.g. [[gallstone]]s)
* [[Gemfibrozil]] (e.g. Lopid)
* [[Fenofibrate]] (e.g. TriCor)

==Indications==
Fibrates are used in accessory therapy in many forms of [[hypercholesterolemia]], usually in combination with [[statin]]s.<ref name="pmid18158710">{{cite journal |author=Steiner G |title=Atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes: a role for fibrate therapy? |journal=Diab Vasc Dis Res |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=368–74 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18158710 |doi=10.3132/dvdr.2007.067}}</ref> Clinical trials do support their use as monotherapy agents. Fibrates reduce the number of non-fatal heart attacks, but do not improve all-cause mortality and are therefore indicated only in those not tolerant to statins.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Abourbih S, Filion KB, Joseph L, Schiffrin EL, Rinfret S, Poirier P, Pilote L, Genest J, Eisenberg MJ | title=Effect of fibrates on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review | journal=Am J Med | year=2009 | volume=122 | pages=962.e1–962.e8 | pmid=19698935 | doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.03.030 | issue=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Effects of fibrates on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis|author=Jun M,  Foote C, Lv J, ''et al.''|journal=Lancet|volume=375|issue=9729|pages=1875&ndash;1884|year=2010|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60656-3}}</ref>

Although less effective in lowering [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and [[triglyceride]] levels by increasing HDL levels and decreasing triglyceride levels, they seem to improve [[insulin resistance]] when the [[dyslipidemia]] is associated with other features of the [[metabolic syndrome]] ([[hypertension]] and [[diabetes mellitus]] type 2). They are therefore used in many [[hyperlipidemias]]. Fibrates are not suitable for patients with low HDL levels. As per US FDA label change of trichor, it is recommended that the HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy.  If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline.  Fibrate therapy should not be re-initiated[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm342600.htm Medwatch]

==Mechanisms of action<ref>http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/98/19/2088.full</ref>==

Evidence from studies in rodents and in humans is available to indicate five major mechanisms underlying the above-mentioned modulation of lipoprotein phenotypes by fibrates:

#Induction of lipoprotein lipolysis: Increased triglyceride-rich [[lipoprotein]] (TRL) lipolysis could be a reflection of changes in intrinsic lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity<!-- 17 --> or increased accessibility of TRLs for lipolysis by LPL owing to a reduction of TRL apoC-III content.<!-- 18 -->
#Induction of hepatic fatty acid (FA) uptake and reduction of hepatic triglyceride production: In rodents, fibrates increase FA uptake and conversion to acyl-CoA by the liver owing to the induction of FA transporter protein <!-- 19 --> and acyl-CoA synthetase activity. Induction of the ß-oxidation pathway with a concomitant decrease in FA synthesis by fibrates results in a lower availability of FAs for triglyceride synthesis, a process that is amplified by the inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue by fibrates.<!-- 21 -->
#Increased removal of LDL particles: Fibrate treatment results in the formation of LDL with a higher affinity for the LDL receptor, which are thus catabolized more rapidly.<!-- 11 -->
#Reduction in neutral lipid (cholesteryl ester and triglyceride) exchange between VLDL and HDL may result from decreased plasma levels of TRL.<!-- 22 -->
#Increase in HDL production and stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport: Fibrates increase the production of apoA-I and apoA-II in liver,<!-- 23 24 --> which may contribute to the increase of plasma HDL concentrations and a more efficient reverse cholesterol transport.

==Side effects==
Most fibrates can cause mild stomach upset and [[myopathy]] (muscle pain with [[creatine kinase|CPK]] elevations). Since fibrates increase the cholesterol content of bile, they increase the risk for [[gallstone]]s. 

In combination with [[statin]] drugs, fibrates cause an increased risk of [[rhabdomyolysis]], idiosyncratic destruction of [[muscle]] tissue, leading to [[renal failure]]. A powerful [[statin]] drug, [[cerivastatin]] (Lipobay), was withdrawn because of this complication. The less [[lipophilic]] [[statin]]s are less prone to cause this reaction, and are probably safer when combined with fibrates.

[[Drug toxicity]] includes [[acute kidney injury]].<ref name="pmid22508733">{{cite journal| author=Zhao YY, Weir MA, Manno M, Cordy P, Gomes T, Hackam DG et al.| title=New fibrate use and acute renal outcomes in elderly adults: a population-based study. | journal=Ann Intern Med | year= 2012 | volume= 156 | issue= 8 | pages= 560–9 | pmid=22508733 | doi=10.1059/0003-4819-156-8-201204170-00003 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22508733  }} </ref>

==Pharmacology==
[[Image:PPAR-diagram.png|thumb|[[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPAR]]]]
Although used clinically since the 1930s,<ref name="urlPharmaceutical composition and method for treatment of digestive disorders - Patent 4976970">{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4976970.html |title=Pharmaceutical composition and method for treatment of digestive disorders - Patent 4976970 |work= |accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref> if not earlier, the mechanism of action of fibrates remained unelucidated until, in the 1990s, it was discovered that fibrates activate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPAR]] (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), especially PPARα. The PPARs are a class of intracellular [[receptor (proteomics)|receptors]] that modulate [[carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrate]] and [[lipid metabolism|fat metabolism]] and [[adipose tissue|adipose tissue differentiation]].

Activating PPARs induces the transcription of a number of [[gene]]s that facilitate [[lipid metabolism]].

Fibrates are structurally and pharmacologically related to the [[thiazolidinedione]]s, a novel class of [[anti-diabetic drug]]s that also act on [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPARs]] (more specifically PPARγ)

Fibrates are a substrate of (metabolized by) [[CYP3A4]].<ref>http://www.stacommunications.com/journals/cardiology/2004/June/Pdf/034.pdf</ref>
