The '''deep perineal pouch''' (also '''deep perineal space''') is a [[human anatomical]] term that refers to the space enclosed in part by the [[perineum]], and located superior to the [[perineal membrane]].
==Structure==
The deep perineal pouch is bordered inferiorly by the perineal membrane, also known as the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.  It is bordered superiorly by the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.<ref>Netter, F., ''Atlas of Human Anatomy.''4th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, 2006.</ref> The deep pouch is now described as the region between the perineal membrane and pelvic diaphragm.<ref> Netter, F., ''Atlas of Human Anatomy.''5th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, 2010.</ref>

==Contents==
The deep perineal pouch contains:
* muscles
** [[Deep transverse perineal muscle]]
** [[External sphincter muscle of urethra]]
** [[External sphincter muscle of female urethra|Compressor Urethrae Muscle]]<ref name="EssentialClinical">Essential Clinical Anatomy - 4th Edition. p.255</ref>
** [[External sphincter muscle of female urethra|Urethrovaginal Sphincter (female)]]<ref name="EssentialClinical" />
* other
** [[Membranous portion of the urethra]] (males) / proximal portion of [[urethra]] (females)
** [[Bulbourethral gland]] (males). (Note: The [[Bartholin gland]] is the female counterpart to the [[bulbourethral gland]] in males, but it is located in the [[superficial perineal pouch]].)
** [[Vagina]] (females)

=="Urogenital diaphragm"==
Older texts have asserted the existence of an "[[urogenital diaphragm]]", which was described as a layer of the [[pelvis]] that separates the [[deep perineal sac]] from the upper pelvis, lying between the [[inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm]] and [[superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm]].
