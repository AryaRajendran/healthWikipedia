==History of discovery==
''Dioctophyme renale'' was discovered in 1583.  Almost two centuries later, in 1782, Johann Goeze first described ''D. renale'' upon discovering the worms in a dog kidney.  The family Dioctophymidae has only one genus (''Dioctophyme''), and the name of the genus was in contention (with the possibility of being ''Dioctophyma'') for two hundred years.  The issue was finally resolved by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]<ref name="Animal Parasitology" /> in 1989.

In 2003, ''D. renale'' eggs were discovered in six human [[coprolites]] in the neolithic site Arbon-Bleiche 3, Switzerland.  This location is located near a lake, which likely provided early humans with access to freshwater fish and frogs.  The samples were dated from 3,384-3,370 BC, and is evidence that the prevalence of this infection was higher in early human history (before full understanding of proper cooking techniques).<ref name="Bailly">Bailly, M. L., U. Leuzinger, and F. Bouchet. "Dioctophymidae Eggs in Coprolites From Neolithic Site of Arbon-Bleiche 3 (Switzerland)." Journal of Parasitology 89 (2003): 1073-076. Dioctophymidae Eggs in Coprolites From Neolithic Site of Arbon&acirc;&#8364;&#8220;Bleiche 3 (Switzerland). BioOne. 22 Feb. 2009 <http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1645/GE-3202RN>.</ref>

==Clinical presentation in humans==
Individuals with ''Dicotophyme renalis'' infection typically present with unspecific symptoms including [[hematuria]]<ref name="Palmer" /><ref name="Charisis" /> (blood in urine), [[nephritis]], loin pain,<ref name="Homo sapiens" /> renal enlargement, and/or [[renal colic]]<ref name="Palmer" /> (intermittent pain in the kidney area), which may result from the rare migration of worms through ureters.<ref name="Animal Parasitology" /><ref name="Homo sapiens" /><ref name="Palmer" /><ref name="Charisis" />

Adult worms typically only infect one kidney.  The kidney is destroyed because of [[fibrosis]], the development of excess fibrous connective tissue.  Renal function is typically limited because the non-infected kidney is usually capable of assuming the increased work.  However, parenchymal inflammation (i.e., inflammation of the functional parts of an organ) can lead to death in extreme circumstances.

==Transmission and life cycle==
Adult ''Dioctophyme renale'' inhabit the kidney (typically the right kidney<ref name="Urinary" /><ref name="Bears" />).  Females produce eggs which are passed in urine.  In aquatic environments, eggs embryonate after 15–100 days.<ref name="Palmer" />  These eggs are ingested by an aquatic oligochaete, hatch, penetrate blood vessels, and develop into a stage three larvae.  A [[paratenic]] host<ref name="Measures">Measures, Lena N., and Roy C. Anderson. "Centrachid Fish as Paratenic Hosts of the Giant Kidney Worm, Dioctophyma Renale (Goeze, 1782), in Ontario, Canada." Journal of Wildlife Diseases 21 (1985): 11-19. 22 Feb. 2009 <http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/21/1/11.pdf>.</ref> may then ingest the [[oligochaete]].  The [[oligochaete]] or [[paratenic]] host is then eaten by a definitive host, wherein juveniles penetrate intestinal lining and migrate to the liver.  After maturing for approximately 50 days, the juveniles then migrate to the kidneys (typically the right kidney).  Upon maturation, ''D. renale'' can survive for five years.<ref name="Animal Parasitology" />

Intermediate hosts are oligochaete annaelids<ref name="Dogs">"Giant Kidney Worm (Dioctophyme renale) in Dogs." Dog, Cat, and Pet Care Tips, Health and Behavior Information by Veterinarians. Veterinary Services Department. 22 Feb. 2009 <http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1621&aid=749>.</ref><ref name="GIDEON" />. Paratenic hosts are fish.

Definitive hosts are carnivorous mammals, notably [[mink]],<ref name="Mace">Mace, T. F. "Lessions in Mink (Mustela vision) Infected with Giant Kidney Worm (Dioctophyma renale)."

Transmission to humans typically occurs upon ingestion of raw or undercooked freshwater fish or frog.<ref name="Homo sapiens" /><ref name="Charisis" />

There are multiple reservoirs for ''D. renale''.  Confirmed cases of infection have occurred in minks,<ref name="Mech">Mech, L. David, and Shawn P. Tracy.

==Morphology==
[[File:Dioctophyme renale eggs.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Dioctophyme renale'' eggs exhibiting the characteristic pitted and sculptured shell.]]
''D. renale'' is the largest [[helminth]] to parasitize humans.  Adult male worms are 20–40&nbsp;cm long and 5–6&nbsp;mm wide; females can grow to 103&nbsp;cm in length with a width of 10–12&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Homo sapiens" />  Both sexes appear bright red in color and taper at both the anterior and posterior ends.  Male ''D. renale'' worms have a bursa, which is used to attach to facilitate mating.

Eggs are 60-80 micrometres x 39-47 micrometres, contain an embryo, and have characteristic sculpturing of the shell.<ref name="Homo sapiens" />  They have an oval-shape and brownish-yellow hue.  Eggs have a thick shell, and the surface appears to be pitted except at the poles.

==Diagnosis==
The only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis is through the identification of ''D. renale'' eggs in a patient’s urine.  However, obtaining patient history (i.e., if the patient has consumed undercooked or raw freshwater fish) is an important first step that can be coupled with radiological exams<ref name="Palmer" /> to search for enlarged or calcified kidneys.  [[Urinalysis]] will likely show hematuria blood tests may reveal eosinophilia.

==Management and therapy==
Likely because of the rarity of human cases, there is no standard treatment<ref name="Bears" /> for ''D. renale'' infection in humans.  The only known means is surgical excision of either adult worms<ref name="GIDEON" /> or the infected kidney.<ref name="Charisis" />  [[Nephrectomy]] is generally considered extreme for human cases.<ref name="Ignjatovic">Ignjatovic I, Stojkovic I, Kutlesic C, Tasic S: Infestation of the Human Kidney with Dioctophyma renale. Urol Int 2003;70:70-73 {{doi|10.1159/000067695}} [http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=67695&Ausgabe=228846&ProduktNr=224282&filename=67695.pdf]</ref>

A physician reportedly used [[Ivermectin]] to treat a patient, who was effectively cured.<ref name="Ignjatovic" />  The use of anti-helminth drugs has not yet been evaluated as the proper course of action to treat this infection.

==Epidemiology==
Though ''D. renale'' is distributed worldwide, though markedly less frequent in Africa and Oceana, human infection is extremely rare.  Regions around the Caspian Sea have the highest number of cases, with the most occurring in Iran.<ref name="Ignjatovic" />  Infections are also most commonly found in areas where freshwater fish is a dietary mainstay.

Non-human infections are more common worldwide, especially in areas of temperate climate.  Prevalence in mink populations may be high, such as portions of Ontario<ref name="Animal Parasitology" /> or Minnesota.<ref name="Mech" />  Similarly, some minnow populations may be as high as 50%.<ref name="Palmer" />

==Public Health and Prevention Strategies==
No public health measures have been undertaken or vaccines developed because of the rarity<ref name="Dogs" /> of human infection.  The majority of ''D. renale'' infections have resulted from undercooked or raw freshwater fish consumption.  Thus, the simple practice of thoroughly cooking fish prior to consumption could be promoted and lead to eradication of ''D. renale'' infection in humans.
