'''Flexor digitorum superficialis''' (''flexor digitorum sublimis'') is an extrinsic flexor [[muscle]] of the [[finger]]s at the [[proximal interphalangeal joints]]. 

It is in the [[anterior compartment of the forearm]]. It is sometimes considered to be the deepest part of the superficial layer of this compartment,<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|273|1117|||}}</ref><ref name="titleDissector Answers - Forearm & Wrist">{{cite web |url=http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/musculoskeletal_system/forearm_ans.html#2o |title=Dissector Answers - Forearm & Wrist |accessdate=2008-01-17 |format= |work=}}</ref> and sometimes considered to be a distinct, "intermediate layer" of this compartment.<ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://anatomy.uams.edu/AnatomyHTML/topogr_upperlimb.html |title=uams.edu |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=}}</ref> It is relatively common for the Flexor digitorum superficialis to be missing from the little finger, bilaterally and unilaterally, which can cause problems when diagnosing a little finger injury.<ref name="Little Finger">{{cite web |url=http://jhs.sagepub.com/content/35/5/417.abstract |title=J Hand Surg Eur |accessdate=2011-02-06 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Origin and Insertion==

The muscle has two classically described heads - the humeroulnar and radial - and it is between these heads that the [[median nerve]] and [[ulnar artery]] pass.  The [[ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint]] gives its origin to part of this muscle. 

Four long [[tendon]]s come off this muscle near the wrist and travel through the [[carpal tunnel]] formed by the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]]. These tendons, along with those of [[flexor digitorum profundus]], are enclosed by a common flexor sheath. The tendons attach to the anterior margins on the bases of the [[middle phalanges]] of the four fingers. These tendons have a split (Camper's Chiasm) at the end of them through which the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus pass.

==Function==

The primary function of flexor digitorum superficialis is flexion of the middle phalanges of the fingers at the [[proximal interphalangeal joints]], however under continued action it also flexes the [[metacarpophalangeal joints]] and [[wrist joint]]. 

To test flexor digitorum superficialis, one finger is flexed at the proximal interphalangeal joint against resistance, while the remaining three fingers are held fully extended (to inactivate flexor digitorum profundus).
