'''Kepone''', also known as '''chlordecone''', is an [[organochlorine compound]]. It is a colourless solid. This compound is a controversial [[insecticide]] related to [[Mirex]] and [[DDT]].  Its use was so disastrous that it is now prohibited in the western world, but only after many millions of kilograms had been produced.<ref name=Ullmann2>Robert L. Metcalf “Insect Control” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry” Wiley-VCH, Wienheim, 2002.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}</ref>

== Toxicology ==
The LC50 (LC = lethal concentration) is 0.022 – 0.095&nbsp;mg/kg for [[blue gill]] and [[trout]].  Kepone bioaccumulates in animals by a factors up to a million-fold.  Workers with repeated exposure suffer severe convulsions resulting from degradation of the synaptic junctions.<ref name=Ullmann2/>

== History ==
In the US, kepone was produced by [[Allied Signal Company]] and LifeSciences Product Company in [[Hopewell, Virginia]]. The improper handling and dumping of the substance into the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] (U.S.) in the 1960s and 1970s drew national attention to its toxic effects on wildlife. The product is similar to DDT and is a degradation product of [[Mirex]].<ref name=Ullmann2/> The history of Kepone incidents are reviewed in ''Who's Poisoning America?: Corporate Polluters and Their Victims in the Chemical Age'' (1982). In 2009, Kepone was included in the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants|Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants]], which bans its production and use worldwide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Case studies===

====James River estuary====
Due to the pollution risks, many businesses and restaurants along the river suffered economic losses. In 1975 Governor [[Mills Godwin Jr.]] shut down the James River to fishing for 100 miles, from [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. This ban remained in effect for 13 years, until efforts to clean up the river began to get results.<ref name="Cooksey">[http://www.richmag.com/?articleID=645276d37159705b89e8bff029b20789 JACK COOKSEY, "What's in the Water?"], ''Richmond Magazine'', June 2007, accessed 13 June 2012</ref>

====French Antilles====
The French island of [[Martinique]] is heavily contaminated with kepone,<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747111175846675158 French Documentary]</ref> following years of its unrestricted use on [[banana]] plantations. Despite a 1990 ban of the substance by France, the economically powerful [[Béké]] planter community lobbied intensively to gain the power to continue using kepone until 1993. They had argued that no alternative pesticide was available, which has since been disputed. Similarly, the nearby island of [[Guadeloupe]] is also contaminated, but to a lesser extent. Since 2003, the local authorities restricted cultivation of crops because the soil has been seriously contaminated by kepone. Guadeloupe has one of the highest [[prostate cancer]] rates in the world.<ref>''European Journal, [[Deutsche Welle]],'' 26 May 2010.[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/episode/0,,5542822,00.html]</ref>

== In popular culture ==
* [[Kepone (band)|Kepone]] was the name of an American indie rock band from [[Richmond, Virginia]] formed in 1991. 
* The [[Dead Kennedys]] recorded a song named "Kepone Factory", a satire of the controversy surrounding Allied Signal and their negligence regarding employee safety, for their 1981 album ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]''. Written in 1978, the song was originally titled "Kepone Kids".
