The '''threshold of pain''' is the point at which [[pain]] begins to be felt. It is an entirely subjective phenomenon. The intensity at which a stimulus (e.g., heat, pressure) begins to evoke pain is the ''threshold intensity''.<ref>{{cite web |title=IASP Pain Terminology |url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Pain_Definitions&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=1728#Pain |publisher=International Association for the Study of Pain |accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref> So, if a hotplate on a person's skin begins to hurt at 42°C (107°F), then that is the ''pain threshold temperature'' for that bit of skin at that time. Forty-two degrees [[Celsius]] is not the pain threshold, it is the temperature at which the pain threshold was crossed. 

The intensity at which a stimulus begins to evoke pain varies from individual to individual and for a given individual over time.

==In hearing==
The [[sound pressure|pressure]] at which sound becomes painful for a listener is the ''pain threshold pressure'' for that person at that time. The threshold pressure for sound varies only slightly with frequency and can be age-dependent.<ref name=painthres>{{cite web|last=Nave|first=Carl R.|title=Threshold of Pain|work=HyperPhysics|publisher=SciLinks|year=2006|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/sound/intens.html|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Additionally, people who have been exposed to more noise/music usually have a higher threshold pressure.<ref>{{Cite document|last=Truax|first=Barry|title=Handbook for Acoustic Ecology| publisher=ARC Publications, World Soundscape Project, Simon Fraser University|year=1999|edition=2|url=http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Threshold_of_Pain.html|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> ''Threshold shift'' can also cause threshold pressure to vary.<ref name=dictionary>{{Cite book|editor1-last=Franks|editor1-first=John R.|editor2-last=Stephenson|editor2-first=Mark R.|editor3-last=Merry|editor3-first =Carol J.|year=1996|month=June|title=Preventing Occupational Hearing Loss - A Practical Guide|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|pages=88|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-110/pdfs/96-110.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-15|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Prolonged exposure to sound at levels evoking pain can cause physical damage, potentially leading to [[hearing impairment]].

The [[volume]] in [[acoustics]] refers to [[loudness]]. It is a common term for the [[amplitude]] of [[sound]], the [[sound pressure level]] or the [[sound pressure]]. Different values for pain threshold pressure level and pain threshold pressure are found in the literature:<ref name=painthres/><ref name=dictionary/>
