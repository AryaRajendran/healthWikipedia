'''Chronic pain''' is [[pain]] that has lasted for a long time. In [[medicine]], the distinction between ''[[Acute (medicine)|acute]]'' and ''[[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]'' pain has traditionally been determined by an arbitrary interval of time since onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since onset,<ref name=Turk1>{{cite book |last1= Turk|first1= D.C. |last2= Okifuji |first2= A.|editor1-first= D.|editor1-last= Loeser |editor2-first= S.

==Classification==
{{main|Pain#Classification}}
Chronic pain may be divided into "[[nociceptive]]" (caused by activation of [[nociceptors]]), and [[neuropathic pain|"neuropathic"]] (caused by damage to or malfunction of the nervous system).<ref>{{cite book |last1= Keay|first1= KA|last2= Clement|first2= CI|last3= Bandler|first3= R|editor1-first= GJT|editor1-last= Horst|title= The nervous system and the heart|year= 2000|publisher= Humana Press|location= Totowa, New Jersey|isbn= 089603|page= 304|chapter= The neuroanatomy of cardiac nociceptive pathways|chapterurl= http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IeElgT1clUcC&pg=PA303&lpg=PA303&dq=%22definitions+of+pain+and+its+central+representation%22#v=onepage&q=%22definitions%20of%20pain%20and%20its%20central%20representation%22&f=true}}</ref>

Nociceptive pain may be divided into "superficial" and "deep", and deep pain into "deep [[somatic]]" and "[[Viscus|visceral]]". ''Superficial'' pain is initiated by [[activation energy|activation]] of nociceptors in the skin or superficial tissues. ''Deep somatic'' pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, [[fasciae]] and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. ''Visceral'' pain originates in the viscera (organs). Visceral pain may be well-localized, but often it is extremely difficult to locate, and several visceral regions produce "referred" pain when damaged or inflamed, where the sensation is located in an area distant from the site of pathology or injury.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Coda|first1= BA|last2= Bonica|first2= JJ|editor1-first= D|editor1-last= Loeser|editor2-first= JJ|editor2-last= Bonica|title= Bonica's management of pain|edition= 3|year= 2001|publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn= 0-443-05683-8|location= Philadelphia|chapter= General considerations of acute pain}}</ref>

Neuropathic pain is divided into "peripheral" (originating in the [[peripheral nervous system]]) and "central" (originating in the brain or spinal cord).<ref name= Bogduk1994>{{cite book |last1= Bogduk|first1= N|last2= Merskey|first2= H|title= Classification of chronic pain: descriptions of chronic pain syndromes and definitions of pain terms|edition= second |publisher= IASP Press|location= Seattle |year= 1994|page= 212|isbn= 0-931092-05-1}}</ref> Peripheral neuropathic pain is often described as “burning,” “tingling,” “electrical,” “stabbing,” or “pins and needles.”.<ref name= Paice2003>{{cite journal |last1= Paice |first1= JA|title= Mechanisms and management of neuropathic pain in cancer|journal= Journal of supportive oncology|year= 2003 |month= Jul-Aug|volume= 1|issue= 2|pages= 107–20|pmid= 15352654|doi= |url= http://www.supportiveoncology.net/journal/articles/0102107.pdf}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Under persistent activation nociceptive transmission to the dorsal horn may induce a wind up phenomenon. This induces pathological changes that lower the threshold for pain signals to be transmitted. In addition it may generate nonnociceptive nerve fibers to respond to pain signals. Nonnociceptive nerve fibers may also be able to generate and transmit pain signals. In chronic pain this process is difficult to reverse or eradicate once established.<ref name="Vadivelu N, Sinatra R.">{{cite journal |author=Vadivelu N, Sinatra R |title=Recent advances in elucidating pain mechanisms |journal=Current opinion in anaesthesiology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=540–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16534290 |doi=10.1097/01.aco.0000183109.27297.75}}</ref>

These structural changes can be explained by the phenomenon known as [[Neuroplasticity#Chronic Pain|neuroplasticity]]. In the case of chronic pain, the [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatototic representation]] of the body is inappropriately reorganized following peripheral and central sensitization. This maladaptative change results in the experience of [[allodynia]] and/or [[hyperalgesia]]. Brain activity in individuals suffering from chronic pain, measured via [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG), has been demonstrated to be altered, suggesting pain-induced neuroplastic changes. More specifically, the relative [[Electroencephalography#Normal activity|beta activity]] (compared to the rest of the brain) is increased, the relative [[Electroencephalography#Normal activity|alpha activity]] is decreased, and the [[Electroencephalography#Normal activity|theta activity]] both absolutely and relatively is diminished.<ref name="Jensen, M.P. 2009">Jensen, M.P., Sherlin, L.H., Hakiman, S., Fregni, F.

==Management==

The emergence of studies relating chronic pain to neuroplasticity also suggest the utilization of [[Neurofeedback#Training process|neurofeedback]] rehabilitation techniques to resolve maladaptive cortical changes and patterns.<ref name="Jensen, M.P. 2009"/> The proposed goal of neurofeedback intervention is to abolish maladaptive neuroplastic changes made as a result of chronic nociception, as measured by abnormal EEG, and thereby relieve the individual's pain. However, this field of research lacks randomized control trials, and therefore requires further investigation.

==Epidemiology==
In a recent large-scale telephone survey of 15 European countries and Israel, 19% of respondents over 18 years of age had suffered pain for more than 6 months, including the last month, and more than twice in the last week, with pain intensity of 5 or more for the last episode, on a scale of 1(no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable). 4839 of these respondents with chronic pain were interviewed in depth. Sixty six percent scored their pain intensity at moderate (5–7), and 34% at severe (8–10); 46% had constant pain, 56% intermittent; 49% had suffered pain for 2–15 years; and 21% had been diagnosed with depression due to the pain. Sixty one percent were unable or less able to work outside the home, 19% had lost a job, and 13% had changed jobs due to their pain. Forty percent had inadequate pain management and less than 2% were seeing a pain management specialist.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16095934 | doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.06.009 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Survey of chronic pain in Europe: prevalence, impact on daily life, and treatment | year=2006 | month=May | author=Breivik H, Collett B, Ventafridda V, Cohen R, Gallacher D | journal=Eur J Pain | pages=287–333}}</ref>

In a systematic literature review published by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), 13 chronic pain studies from various countries around the world were analyzed.  (Of the 13 studies, there were three in the United Kingdom, two in Australia, one each in France, the Netherlands, Israel, Canada, Scotland, Spain, and Sweden, and a multinational.) The authors found that the prevalence of chronic pain was very high and that chronic pain consumes a large amount of healthcare resources around the globe. Chronic pain afflicted women at a higher rate than men.  They determined that the prevalence of chronic pain varied from 10.1% to 55.2% of the population.<ref>{{cite journal | volume=XI | issue=2 | title=How Prevalent Is Chronic Pain? | year=2003 | month=June | author=Harstall C and Ospina M | journal=Pain Clinical Updates, International Association for the Study of Pain | pages=1–4 | url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=Home&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=7594&SECTION=Home}}</ref>

In the United States, the prevalence of chronic pain has been estimated to be approximately 30%.  According to the Institute of Medicine, there are about 116 million Americans living with chronic pain.<ref>{{cite book | title=Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research | publisher=The National Academies Press | location=Washington DC | year=2011 | last=Institute of Medicine of the National Academies Report}}</ref>  The Mayday Fund estimate of 70 million Americans with chronic pain is slightly more conservative.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Call to Revolutionize Chronic Pain Care in America: An Opportunity in Health Care Reform | publisher=The Mayday Fund | year=2009 }}</ref>  In an internet study, the prevalence of chronic pain in the United States was calculated to be 30.7% of the population: 34.3% for women and 26.7% for men.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2010.07.002 | volume=11 | issue=11 | title=The Prevalence of Chronic Pain in United States Adults: Results of an Internet-Based Study | year=2010 | month=Nov | author=Johannes C, Le T, Zhou X, Johnston J, Dworkin R | journal=J Pain | pages=1230–1239}}</ref>  These estimates are in reasonable agreement and indicate a prevalence of chronic pain in the US that is relatively comparable to that of other countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Psychology==

===Personality===
Two of the most frequent personality profiles found in chronic pain patients by the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI) are the ''conversion V'' and the ''neurotic triad''. The conversion V personality, so called because the higher scores on MMPI [[Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory#Clinical_scales|scales]] 1 and 3, relative to scale 2, form a "V" shape on the graph, expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings, develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, and often fails to recognize their own emotional state, including [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The neurotic triad personality, scoring high on scales 1, 2 and 3, also expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings and develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, but is demanding and complaining.<ref>{{cite book |title=Clinical manual of pain management in psychiatry |last=[http://www.appi.org/book.cfm?id=62275 Leo]|first=Raphael |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-58562-275-7  |page=58}}</ref>

Some investigators have argued that it is this [[neuroticism]] that causes acute pain to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other way, to chronic pain causing neuroticism. When long term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and [[anxiety]] fall, often to normal levels.<ref name="Chronic Pain and the Measurement of Personality: Do States Influence Traits?">{{cite journal|last=Fishbain|first=David A.|coauthors=Cole, Brandly, Cutler, R.

===Effect on cognition===
Chronic pain's impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published. Most chronic pain patients complain of cognitive impairment, such as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention, and difficulty completing tasks. Objective testing has found that people in chronic pain tend to experience impairment in attention, memory, mental flexibility, verbal ability, speed of response in a cognitive task, and speed in executing structured tasks. In 2007, Shulamith Kreitler and David Niv advised clinicians to assess cognitive function in chronic pain patients in order to more precisely monitor therapeutic outcomes, and tailor treatment to address this aspect of the pain experience.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kreitler S | coauthor = Niv D | year = 2007 | title = Cognitive impairment in chronic pain | journal = Pain: Clinical Updates | publisher = [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] | volume = XV | issue = 4 | pages = 1–4 | url = http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/TemplateRedirect.cfm?template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=4132 | format = pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-15 }}</ref>
