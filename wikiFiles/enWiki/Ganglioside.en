[[File:GM1 ganglioside.png|300px|thumb|Structure of GM1 ganglioside]]

A '''ganglioside''' is a molecule composed of a [[glycosphingolipid]] ([[ceramide]] and [[oligosaccharide]]) with one or more [[sialic acid]]s (e.g. [[n-acetylneuraminic acid]], NANA) linked on the [[sugar chain]]. NeuNAc, an acetylated derivative of the carbohydrate sialic acid, makes the head groups of gangliosides anionic at [[pH]] 7, which distinguishes them from [[globosides]].

The name ganglioside was first applied by the German scientist Ernst Klenk in 1942 to lipids newly isolated from [[ganglion cell]]s of brain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/Lipids/gang/index.htm |title=Gangliosides, structure, occurrence, biology and analysis |work=Lipid Library |publisher=The American Oil Chemists' Society}}</ref> More than 60 gangliosides are known, in which they differ from each other mainly in the position and number of [[N-Acetylneuraminic acid|NANA]] [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]s. It is a component of the cell [[plasma membrane]] that modulates [[cell signal transduction]] events, and appears to concentrate in [[lipid raft]]s. 

Recently, gangliosides have been found to be highly important molecules in [[immunology]]. Natural and semisynthetic gangliosides are considered possible therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mocchetti I |title=Exogenous gangliosides, neuronal plasticity and repair, and the neurotrophins |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume=62 |issue=19–20 |pages=2283–94 |year=2005 |pmid=16158191 |doi=10.1007/s00018-005-5188-y}}</ref>

==Location==

Gangliosides are present and concentrated on cell surfaces, with the two hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety embedded in the plasma membrane and the oligosaccharides located on the extracellular surface, where they present points of recognition for extracellular molecules or surfaces of neighboring cells. They are found predominantly in the nervous system where they constitute 6% of all phospholipids.<ref name="Stryer" />

==Function==

The oligosaccharide groups on gangliosides extend well beyond the surfaces of the cell membranes, and act as distinguishing surface markers that can serve as specific determinants in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication. These carbohydrate head groups also act as specific receptors for certain [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] [[glycoprotein]] [[hormones]] and certain bacterial protein toxins such as [[cholera toxin]].

The functions of gangliosides as specific determinants suggest its important role in the growth and differentiation of tissues as well as in [[carcinogenesis]]. It has been found that tumor formation can induce the synthesis of a new complement of ganglioside, and very low concentrations of a specific ganglioside can induce differentiation of [[cell culture|cultured]] neuronal tumor cells.<ref name="Lehninger">{{cite book

==Pathology==

Gangliosides are continuously synthesized and degraded in cells. They are degraded to ceramides by sequential removal of sugar units in the oligosaccharide group, catalyzed by a set of highly specific [[lysosome|lysosomal]] enzymes. Mutations in genes coding for these enzymes leads to the accumulation of partially broken down gangliosides in lysosomes, which results in a group of diseases called [[gangliosidosis]]. For example, the fatal [[Tay-Sachs disease]] arises as genetic defects leads to no functional [[hexosaminidase A]] produced, causing GM2 to accumulate in lysosomes, ultimately the [[ganglion cells]] in the nervous system swells enormously, disturbing the normal functions of neurons.<ref name="Stryer">{{cite book

Ganglioside are also involved in several diseases:

*[[Influenza]], in which [[haemagglutinin]] of [[influenza virus]] exploits certain gangliosides to enter and infect the cells expressing them.
*[[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], which has been linked to the production of anti-ganglioside [[antibodies]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nachamkin I |title=Anti-ganglioside antibody induction by swine (A/NJ/1976/H1N1) and other influenza vaccines: insights into vaccine-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome |journal=J.
