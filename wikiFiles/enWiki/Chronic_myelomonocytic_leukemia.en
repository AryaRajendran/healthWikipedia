'''Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia''' (CMML) is a type of [[leukaemia]], which are [[cancer]]s of the blood-forming cells of the [[bone marrow]]. In adults, blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, by a process that is known as [[haematopoiesis]]. In CMML, there are increased numbers of [[monocytes]] and immature blood cells ([[Precursor cell|blasts]]) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, as well as abnormal looking cells ([[dysplasia]]) in at least one type of blood cell.<ref name="pmid19605822">{{cite journal |author=Foucar K |title=Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms |journal=Am.

== Classification ==

[[File:Hematopoiesis (human) diagram.png|thumb|Haematopoiesis. The two lineages of myeloid and lymphoid cells are formed from haematopoietic stem cells.]]

Leukaemia subtypes are categorised into single clinical entities so that they can be diagnosed and treated appropriately. Leukaemias are subdivided into [[lymphoid]] and [[myeloid]] neoplasms, depending on which bone marrow cells are cancerous. The myeloid neoplasms contain acute and chronic leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs are characterised by increased production of myeloid blood cells, with a higher than normal number of mature cells. Unlike MPNs, MDSs have a dysfunctional production of myeloid cells with a reduced number of  mature cells. Many of the cells produced in MDS are abnormal looking, known as dysplasia. CMML shows characteristics of both groups and thus is a difficult disease to categorise.<ref name="isbn4051">{{cite book |author=Bain, Barbara J. |title=Leukaemia Diagnosis |publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-0661-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name = "pmid20699489">{{cite journal |author=Bhargava R, Dalal BI |title=Two steps forward, one step back: 4th WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms (2008)|journal=Indian J Pathol Microbiol |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=391–4 |year=2010 |pmid=20699489 |doi=10.4103/0377-4929.68240|url=}}</ref>

===FAB classification===
The [[French-American-British classification|French-American-British]] (FAB) classification system was published in 1976 to classify the leukaemias. It placed CMML into the category of MDS, along with the refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation. The system does have clinical utility; however factors such as cytogenetic status are not within the remit of the classification. For this reason, many disease entities in these groups show a great deal of heterogeneity.<ref name = "pmid20699489"/><ref name = "isbn85623">{{cite book |author=Turgeon, Mary Louise |title=Clinical hematology: theory and procedures |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=1999 |pages=321–322 |isbn=0-316-85623-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===WHO classification===
In 2001 the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms was published, classifying CMML into a new group of diseases, the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), reflecting the disease's neoplastic nature. Other diseases in this category are [[JMML|juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia]], atypical CML; BCR-ABL1 negative and MDS/MPD unclassifiable. These MDS/MPN overlap syndromes have effective production of some lineages of blood cells, but show ineffective proliferation of other lineages. The 2008 revision of the classification moved cases of CMML with PDGFR gene translocations to a new group, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia with abnormalities of [[PDGFRA]], [[PDGFRB]] or [[FGFR1]].<ref name = "pmid12239137"/><ref name="isbn4051"/><ref name = "isbn0123744199">{{cite book |author=Tsongalis, Gregory J.; Coleman, William L. |title=MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY: THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF HUMAN DISEASE; ED.

== Epidemiology ==
There have been few individual [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies of CMML, due to the difficulty in the disease classification. CMML has an estimated incidence of less than 1 per 100000 persons per year.<ref name="pmid22160044">{{cite journal|author=Cazzola M, Malcovati L, Invernizzi R |title=Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms |journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program |volume=2011 |issue= |pages=264–72 |year=2011 |pmid=22160044 |doi=10.1182/asheducation-2011.1.264|url=}}</ref>
The median age of diagnosis is 65–75. CMML has a propensity for males rather than females, at a ratio of 1.5–3:1.<ref name = "isbn2411">{{cite book |author= |title=Pathology and Genetics of Haemo (World Health Organization Classification of Tumours S.)|publisher=Oxford Univ Pr |location= |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=92-832-2411-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Aetiology ==
Although the [[aetiology]] of CMML is unknown, environmental carcinogens, ionising radiation and cytotoxic agents may have a role in causing disease.<ref name="isbn2411"/> Approximately one third of cases of MDS with a monocyte count of >10% and <1x10<sup>9</sup>/L will progress to CMML.<ref name = "isbn79891">{{cite book |author=Viktoria Faber; Richard Greil; Lisa Pleyer; Daniel Neureiter |title=Chronic Myeloid Neoplasias and Clonal Overlap Syndromes: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology and Treatment Options |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=3-211-79891-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Symptoms ==
One of the most common symptoms of CMML is splenomegaly, found in approximately half of cases. Other less frequent symptoms consist of [[anaemia]], [[fever]], [[weight loss]], [[night sweats]], [[infection]], [[bleeding]], [[synovitis]], [[lymphadenopathy]], skin rashes, [[pleural effusion]], [[pericardial effusion]] and [[peritoneal effusion]].<ref name="isbn4051"/><ref name="isbn2411"/><ref name = "isbn9890">{{cite book |author=Paul Moss; Victor Hoffbrand |title=Essential Haematology, Includes FREE Desktop Edition (Essentials) |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2011 |pages=|isbn=1-4051-9890-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Clinical features ==
[[Blood film|Blood films]] display a range of abnormalities. A monocyte count of >1x10<sup>9</sup>/L is essential for a diagnosis of CMML. Other features may include; leukocytosis (50% of cases); left shift and dysplasia of monocytes and granulocytes; presence of metamyelocytes, [[myelocytes]] and [[promonocytes]]; monocytes with hypersegmented/abnormal shaped nuclei, increased cytoplasmic basophilia and/or the presence of cytoplasmic granules; eosinophilia (in cases of CMML with eosinophilia); and spherocytosis (in cases of DCT positive haemolytic anaemia).

The phenotypical characteristics of CMML are; [[CD11b]], [[CD11c]], [[CD14]], [[CD33]], [[CD45]] and [[CD64]] seen in 100% of cases; [[CD13]] found in 95% of cases; [[CD4]] found in 76% of cases; [[HLA-DR]] found in 71% of cases; [[CD56]] found in 53% of cases; [[CD2]] found in 34% of cases; [[CD16]] found in 29% of cases; [[CD10]] found in 28% of cases; [[CD23]] and [[CD7]] found in 9% of cases; and [[CD117]] found in 5% of cases.<ref name="isbn84214">{{cite book |author=Foxwell Nathan Emmons; Wojciech Gorczyca; James Weisberger |title=An Atlas of Differential Diagnosis in Neoplastic Hematopathology |publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=Washington, DC |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-84214-247-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
===FAB===
The FAB criteria for diagnosis are as follows:<ref name = "pmid6952920">{{cite journal |author=Bennett JM, Catovsky D, Daniel MT,''et al.'' |title=Proposals for the classification of the myelodysplastic syndromes |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=51 |issue=2|pages=189–99 |year=1982 |month=June |pmid=6952920 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

*Monocyte count >1x10<sup>9</sup>/L
*0–19% blasts in bone marrow
*<5% blasts in peripheral blood

====FAB subtypes====
The FAB also arbitrarily categorises CMML into myelodysplastic-like and myeloproliferative-like groups. A white blood count of 13x10<sup>9</sup> is used as a cut-off to differentiate the two.<ref name="pmid22160044"/>

===WHO===
The WHO criteria for diagnosis are as follows:<ref name = "pmid22160042"/>

*Persistent peripheral blood [[monocytosis]] with counts >1x10<sup>9</sup>/L
*No Philadelphia chromosome or [[BCR-ABL]]1 fusion gene
*No rearrangement of [[PDGFRA]] or [[PDGFRB]] gene
*<20% myeloblasts, monoblasts and promonocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow
*Dysplasia in one or more of the myeloid lineages; if myelodysplasia is absent or minimal then a diagnosis of CMML can be made if other requirements are met and:
:*A molecular genetic abnormality is present in haematopoietic cells, or
:*Monocytosis present for ≥3 months and other causes of monocytosis have been ruled out

====WHO subtypes====
WHO defined CMML has two main subsets, CMML-1 and CMML-2. CMML-1 is diagnosed if [[myeloblasts]], [[monoblasts]] and [[promonocytes]] are <5% of peripheral blood and <10% of bone marrow. CMML-2 is diagnosed if:
*Myeloblasts, monoblasts or promonocytes are 5-19% in blood, or
*Myeloblasts, monoblasts or promonocytes are 10-19% in bone marrow, or
*Auer rods are present

CMML-1 and CMML-2 can be additionally grouped as CMML-1 or CMML-2 with eosinophilia. These are diagnosed if the above criteria are met and the blood eosinophil count is >1.5x10<sup>9</sup>/L.<ref name="isbn2411"/>

Presence of two or more phenotypical abnormalities can aid a diagnosis of CMML in the absence of identifying cytogenetic or dysplastic features. These can include the expression of CD56 and/or CD2, or under-expression of HLA-DR.<ref name = "pmid22160042"/>

== Cytogenetic abnormalities and genetic mutations==
Clonal genetic abnormalities are common in CMML but they are not specific for diagnosis of the disease. The most common found are the 8+, −7/del (7q) and structural 12p abnormalities.<ref name="isbn2411"/> [[KRAS]] and [[NRAS]] are mutated in 25–40% of the cases of CMML. The [[Jak2]] V617F mutation is found in 10% of cases. Mutations in transcription factors such as [[RUNX1]], [[CEBPA]], [[NPM1]] and [[WT1]] have been found in up to 30% of cases. Mutations of [[CBL]] are found in approximately 5–18% of cases.<ref name="pmid22160042"/> Mutations it the [[TET2]] gene are found in approximately 40–50% of CMML.<ref name="pmid22160044"/>

== Pathogenesis ==
With a high rate of Ras mutation in CMML, deregulation of this signalling pathway has been linked to the pathogenesis of the disease. [[Tumor necrosis factor|Tumour necrosis factor]], [[GM-CSF]], [[interleukin-3]], [[interleukin-4]], [[interleukin-6]], and [[interleukin-10]] may have a role in hyperproliferative CMML cells. These cytokines can stimulate the growth of CMML ''in vitro''.<ref name ="pmid12446429">{{cite journal |author=Arceci RJ, Longley BJ, Emanuel PD |title=Atypical cellular disorders|journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program |volume= |issue= |pages=297–314 |year=2002 |pmid=12446429 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Hypermethylation of cytosine residues (usually in the promoter regions of genes) occurs in many malignancies to regulate gene expression. One commonly hypermethylated gene in CMML is [[CDKN2B|p15<sup>INK4b</sup>]], a gene involved in cell cycle regulation.<ref name = "pmid20856790">{{cite journal|last=McCormack|first=SE|coauthors=Warlick, ED|title=Epigenetic approaches in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes: clinical utility of azacitidine.|journal=OncoTargets and therapy|date=2010 Sep 7|volume=3|pages=157-65|pmid=20856790}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
=== Factors affecting prognosis ===
CMML-2 has a reduced overall survival as compared with CMML-1, with median survivals of 15 and 20 months, respectively. Myeloproliferative CMML (>13x10<sup>9</sup> monocytes/L) has a reduced survival compared with myelodysplstic CMML. A platelet count of <100 x10<sup>9</sup>/L reduces overall survival. A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some cytogenetic abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses. Trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities and complex karyotypes comprise a high risk group. Other cytogenetic abnormalities have intermediate prognoses. Somatic mutations in genes such as [[ASXL1]] and [[EZH2]] are associated with poor prognosis.<ref name="pmid22160044"/>

CMML has a 20-30% chance of transformation to AML, a lower rate than other similar diseases. The CMML-2 subtype is associated with increased risk of transformation and ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations also increase the risk of transition to AML.<ref name="pmid22160044"/><ref name="FinnPeterson2004">{{cite book|author1=William G.

=== Scoring systems ===
====IPSS====
The [[International Prognostic Scoring System]] (IPSS) was developed in the mid-1990s to assess the prognosis of MDS patients. This system stratifies cases into 2 groups; a lower-risk group (sub divided into low and intermediate-1) and a higher risk (subdivided into intermediate-2 and high). It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopaenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the scoring system being developed for MDS, the more myeloproliferative cases of CMML (WBC >13x109) are excluded from the scoring system. Although the IPSS scoring system is used clinically, there is a high variability in each group. For this reason, new modalities for assessing prognosis in MDS (and CMML) are being developed.<ref name="pmid22160044"/><ref name = "pmid9058730">{{cite journal |author=Greenberg P, Cox C, LeBeau MM, ''et al.''|title=International scoring system for evaluating prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes |journal=Blood |volume=89 |issue=6|pages=2079–88 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9058730 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

====MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System ====

A new method developed using data from the M.D Anderson Cancer Centre found that a haemoglobin level of <12g/dL, total circulating lymphocyte count of >2.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, >0% immature myeloid cells, >10% bone marrow blasts causes a reduced overall survival. This data allows cases of CMML to be stratified into low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high risk groups. These groups have median survival times of 24, 15, 8 and 5 months respectively.<ref name = "pmid21239815">{{cite journal|author=Garcia-Manero G |title=Prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes |journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program |volume=2010|issue= |pages=330–7 |year=2010 |pmid=21239815 |doi=10.1182/asheducation-2010.1.330 |url=}}</ref><ref name = "pmid11806985">{{cite journal |author=Onida F, Kantarjian HM, Smith TL, ''et al.'' |title=Prognostic factors and scoring systems in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: a retrospective analysis of 213 patients |journal=Blood |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=840–9 |year=2002|month=February |pmid=11806985 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

====The Düsseldorf score====

The Düsseldorf score stratifies cases using four categories, giving one point for each; bone marrow blasts ≥5%, LDH >200U/L, haemoglobin ≤9g/dL and a platelet count ≤100,000/uL. A score of 0 indicates a low risk group' 1-2 indicates an intermediate risk group and 3-4 indicates a high risk group. The cumulative 2 year survival of scores 0, 1-2 and 3-4 is 91% , 52% and 9%; and risk of AML transformation is 0%, 19% and 54% respectively.<ref name = "isbn79891"/>

== Treatment ==
The treatment of CMML remains challenging due to the lack of clinical trials investigating the disease as its own clinical entity. It is often grouped with MDS in clinical trials, and for this reason the treatment of CMML is very similar to that of MDS. Most cases are dealt with as supportive rather than curative because most therapies do not effectively increase survival. Indications for treatment include the presence of B symptoms, symptomatic organ involvement, increasing blood counts, hyperleukocytosis, [[leukostasis]] and/or worsening [[cytopenia|cytopaenia]]s.<ref name = "isbn79891"/><ref name="pmid12057067">{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=JM|title=Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.|journal=Current treatment options in oncology|date=2002 Jun|volume=3|issue=3|pages=221-3|pmid=12057067}}</ref>

[[Blood transfusion]]s and [[EPO]] administration are used to raise haemoglobin levels in cases with anaemia.<ref name="pmid12057067"/>

[[Azacitidine]] is a drug approved by the US [[Food & Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of CMML and by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for high risk non-proliferative CMML with 10-19% marrow blasts. It is a cytidine analogue that causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. [[Decitabine]] is a similar drug to azacitidine and is approved by the FDA for treatments of all subtypes of MDS, including CMML. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy that is used in the myeloproliferative form of CMML to reduce cell numbers.<ref name="pmid22160044"/><ref name = "isbn79891"/><ref name = "pmid20856790"/>

[[Hematopoietic stem cell transplant|Haematopoietic stem cell transplant]] remains the only curative treatment for CMML.
