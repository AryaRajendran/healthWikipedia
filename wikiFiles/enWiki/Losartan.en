'''Losartan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) ({{IPAc-en|icon|l|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɑr|t|ən}}) is an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] drug used mainly to treat high blood pressure ([[hypertension]]). Losartan was the first angiotensin II receptor antagonist to be marketed. Losartan potassium is marketed by [[Merck & Co. Inc.]] under the [[trade name]] '''Cozaar'''. {{As of|2009}}, In south east Asia Losartan potassium is marketed by [[Delta Pharma Ltd.]] under the [[trade name]] '''Anin'''. losartan is available in [[Generic drug|generic]] form.

As with all angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>) antagonists, losartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may also delay progression of [[diabetic nephropathy]], and is also indicated for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and microalbuminuria (>30&nbsp;mg/24 hours) or proteinuria (>900&nbsp;mg/24 hours).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Although clinical evidence shows [[calcium channel blockers]] and [[thiazide diuretic|thiazide-type diuretics]] are preferred first-line treatments for most patients (from both efficacy and cost points of view), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as losartan is recommended as first-line treatment in patients under the age of 55 who cannot tolerate an [[ACE inhibitor]].<ref>http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG034NICEguideline.pdf, p19</ref> The LIFE study demonstrated losartan was significantly superior to [[atenolol]] in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke), with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. A study hints that losartan has a beneficial effect on [[mitochondria]] by reversing age related dysfunction in maintaining normal blood pressure and cellular energy usage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/switch_in_cells_power_plant_declines_with_age_rejuvenated_by_drug |title=Switch in cell's 'power plant' declines with age; rejuvenated by drug |publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine |date=August 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1101507108|noedit}}</ref> The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3-6 weeks upon starting losartan.<ref>Abrams, Anne (2007).''Clinical Drug Therapy Rationales for Nursing Practice'',p.846. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. ISBN 0-7817-6263-4.</ref> 

Losartan is also available as [[hydrochlorothiazide/losartan]], a [[combination drug]] with a low dose [[thiazide diuretic]] to achieve an additive antihypertensive effect.

==Mechanism of action and pharmacological actions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Losartan is a selective, competitive [[angiotensin II receptor type 1]] (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor antagonist, reducing the end organ responses to angiotensin II. Losartan administration results in a decrease in total peripheral resistance (afterload) and cardiac venous return (preload) All of the physiological effects of angiotensin II, including stimulation of release of [[aldosterone]], are antagonized in the presence of losartan. Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the [[renin-angiotensin system]]. As a result of losartan dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to removal of the angiotensin II feedback.

Losartan is a [[uricosuric]]. Because losartan can cause [[hyperkalemia]], potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium should not be used without appropriate monitoring by a physician.

==Pharmacokinetics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Losartan is well absorbed following oral administration and undergoes significant first-pass metabolism to produce 5-carboxylic acid metabolite, designated as EXP3174. This metabolite is a long-acting (6 to 8 hr), noncompetitive antagonist at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, and contributes to the pharmacological effects of losartan. EXP3174 is 10-40 times more potent in blocking AT<sub>1</sub> receptors than losartan. Losartan's [[bioavailability]] is about 32%.

Metabolism is primarily by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Peak plasma concentrations of losartan and E-3174 occur about one hour and three to four hours, respectively, after an oral dose. Both losartan and E-3174 are more than 98% bound to plasma proteins. Losartan is excreted in the urine, and in the feces via bile, as unchanged drug and metabolites. About 4% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine, and about 6% is excreted in urine as the active metabolite. The terminal elimination half lives of losartan and E-3174 are about 1.5 to 2.5 hours and 3 to 9 hours, respectively.

==Research==
Losartan has been found to downregulate the expression of [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-β) types I and II receptors in the kidney of diabetic rats, which may partially account for its nephroprotective effects.<ref name="pmid12895325">{{cite journal | author = Guo ZX, Qiu MC | trans_title = Losartan downregulates the expression of transforming growth factor beta type I and type II receptors in kidney of diabetic rat | language = Chinese | journal = Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–8 | year = 2003 | month = June | pmid = 12895325 | title=[Losartan downregulates the expression of transforming growth factor beta type I and type II receptors in kidney of diabetic rat]}}</ref> Effects on TGF-β expression may also account for its potential efficacy in [[Marfan syndrome]] and [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD) – losartan has been shown to prevent [[aortic aneurysm]] and certain pulmonary complications in a mouse model of the disease.<ref name="pmid16601194">{{cite journal | last1 = Habashi | first1 = JP | last2 = Judge | first2 = DP | last3 = Holm | first3 = TM | last4 = Cohn | first4 = RD | last5 = Loeys | first5 = BL | last6 = Cooper | first6 = TK | last7 = Myers | first7 = L | last8 = Klein | first8 = EC | last9 = Liu | first9 = G | title = Losartan, an AT1 antagonist, prevents aortic aneurysm in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 312 | issue = 5770 | pages = 117–21 | year = 2006 | month = April | pmid = 16601194 | pmc = 1482474 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124287 | bibcode=2006Sci...312..117H}}</ref>
