The '''skull''' is a [[bone|bony]] structure in the [[head]] of many  [[animal]]s that supports the structures of the [[face]] and forms a [[Cranial cavity|cavity]] for the brain. 

The skull is composed of two parts: the '''cranium''' and the '''[[mandible]]'''. A skull without a mandible is only a cranium. Animals that have skulls are called [[Craniata|craniates]]. The skull is a part of the [[skeleton]]. 

Functions of the skull include protection of the [[brain]], fixing the distance between the eyes to allow [[stereoscopic vision]], and fixing the position of the ears to help the brain use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned [[ungulates]]); the [[frontal bone]] is where horns are mounted. 

The English word "skull" is probably derived from [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|Old Norse]] "[[wikt:skalli|skalli]]" meaning [[bald]], while the [[Latin]] word ''cranium'' comes from the [[Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek root]] κρανίον (''kranion'').

The skull is made of [[flat bone]]s. The human skull is usually 7&nbsp;mm thick.

== Fish skull ==
[[File:FishKeyDay.jpg|thumb|right|Fish head parts, 1889, Fauna of British India, Sir Francis Day]]

The skull of fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. [[Lamprey]]s and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower jaws being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional [[dermal bone]], forming a more or less coherent [[skull roof]] in [[lungfish]] and [[holost]] fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.

The simpler structure is found in [[jawless fish]], in which the cranium is represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no [[jaw]]s.<ref name=VB2/>

[[Cartilaginous fish]], such as [[shark]]s, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large [[fontanelle]]. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], and capsules to enclose the [[olfactory]] organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the [[inner ear]]. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]], articulating with the first [[vertebra]]. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller [[Foramina of skull|foramina]] for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.<ref name=VB2>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 173–177|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In [[ray-finned fish]]es, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the [[premaxilla]], with the [[maxilla]] itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.<ref name=VB/>

Although the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living [[lungfish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the [[pterygoid bone|pterygoid]]s and [[vomer]]s alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from [[cartilage]], and its overall structure is reduced.<ref name=VB/>

== Tetrapod skull ==
[[File:Tiktaalik skull front.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', an extinct genus transitional between the [[lobe-finned fish]] and the early tetrapods. From the [[Late Devonian]].]]

The skulls of the earliest [[tetrapod]]s closely resembled those of their [[ancestor]]s amongst the [[lobe-finned fish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is formed of a series of plate-like bones, including the [[maxilla]], [[frontal bone|frontals]], [[parietal bone|parietal]]s, and [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]]s, among others. It is overlaying the [[endocranium]], corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in [[sharks]] and [[Batoidea|rays]]. The various separate bones that compose the [[temporal bone]] of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the [[vomer]] and [[palatine bone]]s. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the [[foramen magnum]] and a median bone lying further forward; these are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[occipital bone]] and parts of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian [[mandible]].<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 216–247|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In living tetrapods, a great many of the original bones have either disappeared, or fused into one another in various arrangements.

Living [[amphibian]]s typically have greatly reduced skulls, with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage.<ref name=VB/>
In mammals and birds, in particular, modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain. The fusion between the various bones is especially notable in birds, in which the individual structures may be difficult to identify.
[[File:Massospondylus Skull Steveoc 86.png|thumb|right|The fenestrae in the skull of the dinosaur ''[[Massospondylus]]''.]]

The [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestrae]] (from Latin, meaning ''windows'') are openings in the skull.
* [[Antorbital fenestra]]
* [[Mandible|Mandibular]] fenestra
* [[Palate|Palatal]] fenestra, as found in [[Marsupial]]s
* [[Quadratojugal]] fenestra
* [[Subsquamosal fenestra]], an opening between two parts of the [[squamosal bone]] in some rodents
* [[Temple (anatomy)|Temporal]] fenestra

[[Ceratopsia]] dinosaurs may have fenestrae in their [[neck frill|frill]]s.

=== Temporal fenestrae ===
The [[Temple (anatomy)|temporal]] fenestrae are anatomical features of the skulls of several types of [[amniote]]s, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the [[postorbital]] and [[squamosal]] bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.

Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the [[Synapsid]]s (mammal-like reptiles) and the [[Diapsids]] (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess no fenestral openings in the skull, as the trait has been modified. They do, though, still have the temporal orbit (which resembles an opening) and the temporal muscles. It is a hole in the head and is situated to the rear of the orbit behind the eye.

===Classification===
[[File:Chimpanzee skull.jpg|thumb|right|Chimpanzee skull]]

There are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their fenestra. These are:
* [[Anapsid]]a - no openings
* [[Synapsid]]a - one low opening (beneath the postorbital and squamosal bones)
* [[Euryapsida]] - one high opening (above the postorbital and squamosal bones); euryapsids actually evolved from a diapsid configuration, losing their lower temporal fenestra.
* [[Diapsid]]a - two openings

Evolutionarily, they are related as follows:
*[[Amniota]]
**Class '''[[Synapsid]]a'''
***Order [[Therapsida]]
****Class [[Mammal]]ia - mammals
**(Unranked)[[Sauropsid]]a - reptiles
***Subclass '''[[Anapsid]]a'''
***(unranked) [[Eureptilia]]
****Subclass '''[[Diapsid]]a'''
*****(unranked) '''[[Euryapsida]]'''
*****Class [[bird|Aves]] - birds

== Human skull ==
[[File:Caucasian Human Skull.jpg|thumb|220px|Model of a male human skull in the collections of the Museum of Osteology]]
:''For details and the constituent bones, see [[human skull]], [[neurocranium]] and [[viscerocranium]].''

In humans, as in other [[mammal]]s, the aforementioned division of the skull into the cranium and mandible is not usually followed. Instead, for the purposes of describing their [[anatomy]] and [[enumeration|enumerating]] their bones, mammalian and human skulls are divided differently: They are deemed to consist of two categorical parts, the [[neurocranium]] and the [[viscerocranium]]. The neurocranium (or braincase) is a protective [[cranial vault|vault surrounding the brain]]. The viscerocranium (also splanchnocranium or facial skeleton) is formed by the bones supporting the [[face]]. Both parts have different embryological origins.

Except for the [[mandible]], all of the bones of the skull are joined together by [[sutures of skull|sutures]], rigid [[Articulation (anatomy)|articulation]]s permitting very little movement.<ref>The [[hyoid bone]] and the [[ossicles]] are joined together with [[synarthroses]], but despite their location, they are not normally considered skull bones.</ref>

The skull is supported on the summit of the vertebral column, and is of an oval shape, wider behind than in front. It is composed of a series of flattened or irregular bones which, with one exception (the mandible), are immovably jointed together. It is divisible into two parts: (1) the cranium, which lodges and protects the brain, consists of eight bones, and (2) the skeleton of the face, of fourteen, as follows:<ref>http://www.bartleby.com/107/30.html</ref>
:Skull, 22 bones
::Cranium, 8 bones
:::i. Occipital.
:::ii. Two Parietals.
:::iii. Frontal.
:::iv. Two Temporals.
:::v. Sphenoidal.
:::vi. Ethmoidal.
  
::Face, 14 bones 
:::i. Two Nasals.
:::ii. Two Maxillæ.
:::iii. Two Lacrimals.
:::iv. Two Zygomatics.
:::v. Two Palatines.
:::vi. Two Inferior Nasal Conchæ.
:::vii. Vomer.
:::viii.Mandible.
 
In the Basle nomenclature, certain bones developed in association with the nasal capsule, viz., the inferior nasal conchæ, the lacrimals, the nasals, and the vomer, are grouped as cranial and not as facial bones. The hyoid bone, situated at the root of the tongue and attached to the base of the skull by ligaments, is described in this section

== Bones ==
The [[jugal]] is a skull bone found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. In mammals, the jugal is often called the malar or zygomatic.

The [[prefrontal bone]] is a bone separating the lacrimal and frontal bones in many tetrapod skulls.

== Terminology ==
* [[Chondrocranium]], a primitive cartilagionous skeletal structure
* [[Endocranium]]
* [[Epicranium]]
* [[Pericranium]], a membrane that lines the outer surface of the cranium
