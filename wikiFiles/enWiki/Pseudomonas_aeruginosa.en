'''''Pseudomonas aeruginosa ''''' is a common [[bacterium]] that can cause [[disease]] in animals, including humans. It is found in soil, water, [[skin flora]], and most man-made environments throughout the world. It thrives not only in normal atmospheres, but also in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] atmospheres, and has, thus, colonized many natural and artificial environments. It uses a wide range of organic material for food; in animals, the versatility enables the organism to infect damaged tissues or those with reduced immunity. The symptoms of such infections are generalized [[inflammation]] and [[sepsis]]. If such colonizations occur in critical body organs, such as the [[lung]]s, the [[urinary tract]], and [[kidneys]], the results can be fatal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Balcht, Aldona & Smith, Raymond | title = Pseudomonas Aeruginosa: Infections and Treatment|publisher = Informa Health Care |pages = 83–84 |year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8247-9210-6}}</ref> Because it thrives on most surfaces, this bacterium is also found on and in [[medical equipment]], including [[catheter]]s, causing cross-[[infection]]s in [[hospital]]s and [[clinic]]s. It is implicated in [[hot-tub rash]]. It is also able to decompose hydrocarbons and has been used to break down [[tarball (oil)|tarballs]] and oil from [[oil spill]]s.<ref name=itah>{{cite journal|author=A. Y. Itah and J. P.

''P. aeruginosa'' secretes a variety of pigments, including [[pyocyanin]] (blue-green), [[pyoverdine]] (yellow-green and [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]]), and pyorubin (red-brown). King, Ward, and Raney developed ''Pseudomonas'' Agar P (King A medium) for enhancing pyocyanin and pyorubin production, and ''Pseudomonas'' Agar F (King B medium) for enhancing fluorescein production.<ref>{{cite journal | author = King EO, Ward MK, Raney DE | title = Two simple media for the demonstration of pyocyanin and fluorescein | journal = J Lab Clin Med | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 301–7 | year = 1954 | pmid = 13184240}}</ref>
[[File:Pseudomonas aeruginosa.JPG|thumb|''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' fluorescence under UV illumination]]
''P. aeruginosa'' is often preliminarily identified by its [[pearlescent]] appearance and grape-like or tortilla-like odor ''[[in vitro]]''. Definitive clinical identification of ''P. aeruginosa'' often includes identifying the production of both pyocyanin and fluorescein, as well as its ability to grow at 42°C. ''P. aeruginosa'' is capable of growth in [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[jet fuel]], where it is known as a [[hydrocarbon]]-using [[microorganism]] (or "HUM bug"), causing [[microbial corrosion]].<ref name="avibiopharma" /> It creates dark, gellish mats sometimes improperly called "[[algae]]" because of their appearance. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Although classified as an [[aerobic organism]], ''P. aeruginosa'' is considered by many as a [[facultative anaerobe]], as it is well adapted to proliferate in conditions of partial or total oxygen depletion. This organism can achieve [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] growth with [[nitrate]] as a [[Electron acceptor|terminal electron acceptor]], and, in its absence, it is also able to ferment [[arginine]] by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Palmer KL, Brown SA, Whiteley M |title=Membrane-bound nitrate reductase is required for anaerobic growth in cystic fibrosis sputum |journal=J.

==Nomenclature==   
*The word ''Pseudomonas'' means "false unit", from the Greek ''pseudo'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: '''ψευδο''', false) and ''monas'' ({{lang-la|'''monas'''}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: '''μονος''', a single unit). The stem word ''mon'' was used early in the history of [[microbiology]] to refer to [[Germ theory of disease|germ]]s, e.g., Kingdom [[Monera]].
*The species name ''aeruginosa'' is a Latin word meaning [[verdigris]] ("copper rust"), as seen with the oxidized copper patina on the [[Statue of Liberty]]. This also describes the blue-green bacterial pigment seen in laboratory cultures of the species. This blue-green pigment is a combination of two metabolites of ''P. aeruginosa'', pyocyanin (blue) and pyoverdine (green), which impart the blue-green characteristic color of cultures. Pyocyanin biosynthesis is regulated by [[quorum sensing]], as in the [[biofilm]]s associated with colonization of the [[lungs]] in [[cystic fibrosis]] patients. Another assertion is that the word may be derived from the Greek prefix ''ae-'' meaning "old or aged", and the suffix ''ruginosa'' means wrinkled or bumpy.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brown, RW |title=Composition of Scientific Words |year=1956 |publisher=Smithsonian Institutional Press |isbn=0-87474-286-2}}</ref>
*The derivations of '''pyocyanin''' and '''pyoverdine''' are of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], with ''pyo-'', meaning "pus", ''cyanin'', meaning "blue", and ''verdine'', meaning "green". Pyoverdine in the absence of pyocyanin is a fluorescent-yellow color.

==Genome==
The genome of ''P. aeruginosa'' is relatively large (6-7 Mb) and encodes around 6,000 (predicted) [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs), depending on the strain. There are 5,021 genes that are conserved across all five genomes analyzed, with at least 70% sequence identity. This set of genes is the ''P. aeruginosa'' core genome.<ref name="PAgenomes">{{Cite pmid| 18287045}}</ref>

The [[Guanine|G]]+[[Cytosine|C]]-rich ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' [[chromosome]] consists of a conserved core and a variable accessory part. The core genomes of ''P. aeruginosa'' strains are largely collinear, exhibit a low rate of sequence [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], and contain few [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of high [[sequence]] diversity, the most notable ones being the pyoverdine locus, the [[flagella]]r regulon, ''pilA'', and the O-antigen biosynthesis locus. Variable segments are scattered throughout the genome, of which about one-third are immediately adjacent to tRNA or tmRNA genes. The three known hot spots of genomic diversity are caused by the integration of genomic islands of the pKLC102/PAGI-2 family into tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> or tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> genes. The individual islands differ in their repertoire of metabolic genes, but share a set of [[synteny|syntenic]] genes that confer their horizontal spread to other clones and species. Colonization of atypical disease habitats predisposes to deletions, genome rearrangements, and accumulation of loss-of-function mutations in the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[chromosome]]. The ''P. aeruginosa'' population is characterized by a few dominant clones widespread in disease and environmental habitats. The [[genome]] is made up of clone-typical segments in core and accessory genome and of blocks in the core genome with unrestricted gene flow in the population.<ref name=Cornelis/>

==Cell-surface polysaccharides==
Cell-surface [[polysaccharide]]s play diverse roles in the bacterial "lifestyle". They serve as a barrier between the [[cell wall]] and the environment, mediate host-pathogen interactions, and form structural components of [[biofilm]]s. These polysaccharides are synthesized from nucleotide-activated precursors, and, in most cases, all the enzymes necessary for biosynthesis, assembly, and transport of the completed polymer are encoded by genes organized in dedicated clusters within the genome of the [[organism]]. [[Lipopolysaccharide]] is one of the most important cell-surface polysaccharides, as it plays a key structural role in outer membrane integrity, as well as being an important mediator of host-pathogen interactions. The genetics for the biosynthesis of the so-called A-band (homopolymeric) and B-band (heteropolymeric) O antigens have been clearly defined, and much progress has been made toward understanding the biochemical pathways of their biosynthesis. The exopolysaccharide alginate is a linear copolymer of β-1,4-linked D-mannuronic acid and L-glucuronic acid residues, and is responsible for the mucoid phenotype of late-stage cystic fibrosis disease. The ''pel'' and ''psl'' loci are two recently discovered gene clusters, which also encode exopolysaccharides found to be important for biofilm formation. A [[rhamnolipid]] is a biosurfactant whose production is tightly regulated at the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al level, but the precise role it plays in disease is not well understood at present. Protein [[glycosylation]], in particular of [[pilin]] and [[flagellin]], is a recent focus of research by several groups, and it has been shown to be important for adhesion and invasion during bacterial infection.<ref name=Cornelis/>

An [[Opportunistic infection|opportunistic]], [[Nosocomial infection|nosocomial]] pathogen of [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals, ''P. aeruginosa'' typically infects the pulmonary tract, [[urinary tract infection|urinary tract]], [[burn (injury)|burn]]s, [[wound]]s, and also causes other [[sepsis|blood infections]].<ref>[http://textbookofbacteriology.net/pseudomonas.html Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology].

[[Cystic fibrosis]] patients are also predisposed to ''P. aeruginosa'' infection of the lungs. ''P. aeruginosa'' may also be a common cause of "hot-tub rash" ([[dermatitis]]), caused by lack of proper, periodic attention to water quality. The most common cause of burn infections is ''P. aeruginosa''. ''Pseudomonas'' is also a common cause of postoperative infection in [[radial keratotomy]] surgery patients. The organism is also associated with the skin lesion [[ecthyma gangrenosum]]. ''P. aeruginosa'' is frequently associated with [[osteomyelitis]] involving puncture wounds of the foot, believed to result from direct inoculation with ''P. aeruginosa'' via the foam padding found in tennis shoes, with diabetic patients at a higher risk.

===Toxins===
''P. aeruginosa'' uses the [[virulence factor]] [[exotoxin A]] to inactivate [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylate]] [[eukaryotic elongation factor 2]] in the host cell, much as the [[diphtheria toxin]] does. Without elongation factor 2, [[eukaryotic cells]] cannot synthesize [[proteins]] and necrose. The release of intracellular contents induces an [[immune system|immunologic response]] in [[immunocompetent]] patients.
In addition ''P. aeruginosa'' uses an exoenzyme, ExoU, which degrades the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, leading to [[lysis]].

===Triggers===
With low [[phosphate]] levels, ''P. aeruginosa'' has been found to activate from benign symbiont to express lethal toxins inside the intestinal tract and severely damage or kill the host, which can be mitigated by providing excess phosphate instead of antibiotics.<ref name="physorg">{{cite press release |url=http://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1589 |title=Research could lead to new non-antibiotic drugs to counter hospital infections |publisher=University of Chicago Medical Center |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}</ref>

QS is known to control expression of a number of [[virulence factors]]. Another form of [[gene regulation]] that allows the [[bacteria]] to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling.

[[Biofilm]]s of ''P. aeruginosa'' can cause chronic [[opportunistic infection]]s, which are a serious problem for medical care in industrialized societies, especially for immunocompromised patients and the elderly. They often cannot be treated effectively with traditional [[antibiotic]] therapy. Biofilms seem to protect these bacteria from adverse environmental factors. ''P. aeruginosa'' can cause [[nosocomial infection]]s and is considered a [[model organism]] for the study of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers consider it important to learn more about the molecular mechanisms that cause the switch from [[plankton]]ic growth to a biofilm phenotype and about the role of [[inter-bacterial communication|interbacterial communication]] in treatment-resistant bacteria such as ''P. aeruginosa''. This should contribute to better clinical management of chronically infected patients, and should lead to the development of new drugs.<ref name=Cornelis/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyocyanin.jpg|thumb|right|Production of pyocyanin, water-soluble blue pigment of ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' (left tube)]]
Depending on the nature of [[infection]], an appropriate specimen is collected and sent to a [[bacteriology]] laboratory for identification. As with most bacteriological specimens, a [[Gram stain]] is performed, which may show Gram-negative rods and/or [[white blood cells]]. ''P. aeruginosa'' produces colonies with a characteristic 'grape-like' odour on bacteriological media. In mixed cultures, it can be isolated as clear colonies on [[MacConkey agar]] (as it does not ferment lactose) which will test positive for [[oxidase]]. Confirmatory tests include production of the blue-green pigment [[pyocyanin]] on [[cetrimide agar]] and growth at 42°C. A [[TSI slant]] is often used to distinguish nonfermenting ''Pseudomonas'' species from enteric pathogens in faecal specimens.

==Treatment==
''P. aeruginosa'' is frequently isolated from nonsterile sites (mouth swabs, [[sputum]], etc.), and, under these circumstances, it often represents colonization and not infection. The isolation of ''P. aeruginosa'' from nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be interpreted cautiously, and the advice of a [[microbiology|microbiologist]] or infectious diseases physician/pharmacist should be sought prior to starting treatment. Often no treatment is needed.

When ''P. aeruginosa'' is isolated from a sterile site (blood, bone, deep collections), it should be taken seriously, and almost always requires treatment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

''P. aeruginosa'' is naturally [[antibiotic-resistance|resistant]] to a large range of antibiotics and may demonstrate additional resistance after unsuccessful treatment, in particular, through modification of a porin. It should usually be possible to guide treatment according to laboratory sensitivities, rather than choosing an antibiotic [[empiric therapy|empirically]]. If antibiotics are started empirically, then every effort should be made to obtain cultures, and the choice of antibiotic used should be reviewed when the culture results are available.

[[Phage therapy]] against ''P. aeruginosa'' remains one of the most effective treatments, which can be combined with antibiotics, has no contraindications and minimal adverse effects. Phages are produced as sterile liquid, suitable for intake, applications etc.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Bacteriophage therapy |year=2001 |author= A. Sulakvelidze, Z. Alavidze and J.G. Morris, Jr. |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|pages=649–659|volume=45|issue= 3|doi=10.1128/AAC.45.3.649-659.2001 |pmid=11181338 |pmc=90351}}</ref>
Phage therapy against ear infections caused by ''P. aeruginosa'' was reported in the journal ''Clinical Otolaryngology'' in August 2009<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1749-4486.2009.01973.x}}</ref>

Antibiotics that have activity against ''P. aeruginosa'' may include:

*[[aminoglycoside]]s ([[gentamicin]], [[amikacin]], [[tobramycin]], but ''not'' [[kanamycin]])
*[[quinolone]]s ([[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], but not [[moxifloxacin]])
*[[cephalosporin]]s ([[ceftazidime]], [[cefepime]], [[cefoperazone]], [[cefpirome]], [[ceftobiprole]], but ''not'' [[cefuroxime]], [[ceftriaxone]], [[cefotaxime]])
*[[antipseudomonal penicillins]]: [[carboxypenicillin]]s ([[carbenicillin]] and [[ticarcillin]]), and [[ureidopenicillin]]s ([[mezlocillin]], [[azlocillin]], and [[piperacillin]]). ''P. aeruginosa'' is intrinsically resistant to all other [[penicillin]]s.
*[[carbapenem]]s ([[meropenem]], [[imipenem]], [[doripenem]], but ''not'' [[ertapenem]])
*[[polymyxin]]s ([[polymyxin B]] and [[colistin]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hachem RY |title=Colistin is effective in treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in cancer patients |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1905–11 |year=2007 |pmid=17387153 |doi=10.1128/AAC.01015-06 |pmc=1891378|author2=Chemaly RF |author3=Ahmar CA |last4=Jiang |first4=Y. |last5=Boktour |first5=M. R. |last6=Rjaili |first6=G. A. |last7=Bodey |first7=G. P. |last8=Raad |first8=I. I.}}</ref>
*[[monobactam]]s ([[aztreonam]])

These antibiotics must all be given by [[injection (medicine)|injection]], with the exceptions of fluoroquinolones, aerosolized tobramycin and aerosolized aztreonam. For this reason, in some hospitals, fluoroquinolone use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains of ''P. aeruginosa''. In the rare occasions where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), [[topical]] gentamicin or colistin may be used.

===Antibiotic resistance===
One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low [[antibiotic]] susceptibility, which  is attributable to a concerted action of multidrug [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux pump]]s with chromosomally encoded [[antibiotic resistance]] genes (e.g., ''mexAB'', ''mexXY'' etc.<ref name="Poole2004">{{Cite pmid|14706082}}</ref>) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes. In addition to this intrinsic resistance, ''P. aeruginosa'' easily develops acquired resistance either by [[mutation]] in chromosomally encoded genes or by the [[horizontal gene transfer]] of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of [[multidrug resistance]] by ''P. aeruginosa'' isolates requires several different genetic events, including acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in ''P. aeruginosa'' strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in [[integron]]s favors the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some recent studies have shown phenotypic resistance associated to [[biofilm]] formation or to the emergence of small-colony variants may be important in the response of ''P. aeruginosa'' populations to [[antibiotic]]s treatment.<ref name=Cornelis>{{cite book | author = Cornelis P (editor). | title = Pseudomonas: Genomics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pseudo| isbn = 1-904455-19-0}}</ref>
