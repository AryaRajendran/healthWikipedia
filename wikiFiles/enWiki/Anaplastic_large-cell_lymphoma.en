'''Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma''' (ALCL) is a type of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] involving aberrant T-cells. It features in the World Health Organisation ([[WHO]]) classification of [[lymphoma]]s. 

Its name derives from [[anaplasia]] and [[large-cell lymphoma]].

==Signs and symptoms==
It occurs in both nodal and extranodal locations. It typically presents at a late stage and is often associated with systemic symptoms ("[[B symptoms]]").

[[Granuloma]]s may be present.<ref name="pmid19136786">{{cite journal |author=Balamurugan S, Rajasekar B, Rao RR |title=Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma with florid granulomatous reaction: A case report and review of literature |journal=Indian J Pathol Microbiol |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=69–70 |year=2009 |pmid=19136786 |doi= 10.4103/0377-4929.44969|url=http://www.ijpmonline.org/article.asp?issn=0377-4929;year=2009;volume=52;issue=1;spage=69;epage=70;aulast=Balamurugan}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
To make this diagnosis under its present system of classification, the WHO the presence of "hallmark" cells and immunopositivity for [[CD30]].

The classification acknowledges as typical, but does not require, immunopositivity for ALK ([[anaplastic lymphoma kinase]]) protein.  It specifically excludes primary [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]]s and other specific types of anaplastic lymphoma (particularly those of [[B-cell]] lineage) with CD30 positivity.

The hallmark cells are of medium size and feature abundant [[cytoplasm]] (which may be clear, amphophilic or eosinophilic), kidney shaped [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], and a paranuclear eosinophilic region. Occasional cells may be identified in which the plane of section passes through the nucleus in such a way that it appears to enclose a region of cytoplasm within a ring; such cells are called "doughnut" cells. 

By definition, on histological examination, hallmark cells are always present. Where they are not present in large numbers, they are usually located around blood vessels. Morphologic variants include the following types:
*Common (featuring a predominance of hallmark cells)
*Small-cell (featuring smaller cells with the same immunophenotype as the hallmark cells)
*Lymphohistiocytic
*Sarcomatoid
*Signet ring

===Immunophenotype===
The hallmark cells (and variants) show immunopositivity for CD30<ref name="pmid17965727">{{cite journal |author=Watanabe M, Ogawa Y, Itoh K, ''et al.'' |title=Hypomethylation of CD30 CpG islands with aberrant JunB expression drives CD30 induction in Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma |journal=Lab.

True positivity requires localisation of signal to the cell membrane and/or paranuclear region (cytoplasmic positivity is considered non-specific and non-informative). Another useful marker which helps to differentiate this lesion from Hodgkin lymphoma is Clusterin. The neoplastic cells have a golgi staining pattern (hence paranuclear staining), which is characteristic of this lymphoma. The cells are also typically positive for a subset of markers of T-cell lineage. However, as with other T-cell lymphomas, they are usually negative for the pan T-cell marker CD3. Occasional examples are of null (neither T nor B) cell type. These lymphomas show immunopositivity for ALK protein in 70% of cases. They are also typically positive for EMA.  In contrast to many B-cell anaplastic CD30 positive lymphomas, they are negative for markers of [[Epstein-Barr Virus]] (EBV).

=== Molecular biology ===
The majority of cases, greater than 90%, contain a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor. This may be identified using PCR techniques, such as T-gamma multiplex PCR.  Oncogeneic potential is conferred by upregulation of a [[tyrosine kinase]] gene on [[chromosome]] 2. Several different translocations involving this gene have been identified in different cases of this lymphoma.  The most common is a [[chromosomal translocation]] involving the nucleophosmin gene on chromosome 5.  The translocation may be identified by analysis of giemsa-banded metaphase spreads of tumour cells and is characterised by t(2;5)(p23;q35).  The product of this [[Gene fusion|fusion]] [[gene]] may be identified by [[immunohistochemistry]] using antiserum to ALK protein.  Probes are available to identify the translocation by fluorescent in situ hybridization.  The nucleophosmin component associated with the commonest translocation results in nuclear positivity as well as cytoplasmic positivity.  Positivity with the other translocations may be confined to the cytoplasm. Mutagenesis and functional studies have identified a plethora of NPM–ALK interacting molecules which ultimately lead to the activation of key pathways including RAS/Erk, PLC-γ, PI3K, and Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) path- ways, which in turn control cell proliferation and survival and cytoskeletal rearrangements.<ref name="pmid22649787">{{cite journal |author=Tabbó F, Barreca A, Piva R, Inghirami G; European T-Cell Lymphoma Study Group |title=ALK Signaling and Target Therapy in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma |journal=Front Oncol |volume=2 |pages=41 |year=2012 |pmid=22649787 |doi= 10.3389/fonc.2012.00041|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Cancer_Molecular_Targets_and_Therapeutics/10.3389/fonc.2012.00041/abstract}}</ref> It has been demonstrated that NPM-ALK oncogenic effects is sustained by STAT3 activation. Activation of STAT3 is associated with a specific signature, which includes several transcription factors (i.e., CEBP/β), cell cycle (i.e., Cyclin D, c-myc etc.), survival/apoptosis molecules (Bcl-A2, Bcl-XL, Survivin, MCL-1) and cell adhesion, and mobility proteins.<ref name="pmid20159827">{{cite journal |author=Piva R, Agnelli L, Pellegrino E, Todoerti K, ''et al.'' |title=Gene expression profiling uncovers molecular classifiers for the recognition of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma within peripheral T-cell neoplasms |journal=J Clin Oncol |volume=28 | issue=9 |pages=1583–90 |year=2010 |pmid=20159827 |doi= 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.9759|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/9/1583.long}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis and diagnostic pitfalls ===
As the appearance of the hallmark cells, pattern of growth (nesting within lymph nodes) and positivity for EMA may mimic [[metastatic]] [[carcinoma]], it is important to include markers for [[cytokeratin]] in any diagnostic panel (these will be negative in the case of anaplastic lymphoma).  Other mimics include CD30 positive B-cell lymphomas with anaplastic cells (including Hodgkin lymphomas).  These are identified by their positivity for markers of B-cell lineage and frequent presence of markers of EBV. Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas may also be positive for CD30; these are excluded by their anatomic distribution. ALK positivity may also be seen in some large-cell B-cell lymphomas and occasionally in [[rhabdomyosarcoma]]s.

== Treatment ==
* Managed under "Aggressive Lymphoma" guidelines.
** [[CHOP]] is first line of treatment, CHOP-[[Rituxan]] in the unlikely scenario that [[CD20]] is positive, given that CD20 is a [[B-cell]] marker.
** [[Radiation therapy]] as per institutional preference (based on ECOG, SWOG, and GELA trials), but usually added for bulky disease
*Localized primary cutaneous ALCL<ref name=liu>{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Delong|title=Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/208050-overview#aw2aab6c25|publisher=Medscape}}</ref>
**Radiation therapy alone
**Surgical excision alone
**Surgically excision with adjuvant radiation.

==Prognosis==
During treatment, relapses may occur but these typically remain sensitive to [[chemotherapy]].

Those with ALK positivity have a better [[prognosis]]. It is possible that ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas represent other T-cell lymphomas that are morphologic mimics of ALCL in a final common pathway of disease progression.  Whereas ALK-positive ALCLs are molecularly characterized and can be readily diagnosed, specific immunophenotypic or genetic features to define ALK-negative ALCL are missing and their distinction from other T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-NHLs) remains controversial, although promising diagnostic tools for their recognition have been developed and might be helpful to drive appropriate therapeutic protocols.<ref name="pmid22740451">{{cite journal |author=Agnelli L, Mereu E, Pellegrino E, Limongi T, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of a 3-gene model as a powerful diagnostic tool for the recognition of ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma |journal=Blood |volume=120 | issue=6 |pages=1274–81 |year=2012 |pmid=22740451 |doi= 10.1182/blood-2012-01-405555|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/120/6/1274.long}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The lymphoma is more common in the young and in males.

A 2008 study found an increased risk of ALCL of the breast in women with silicone breast implants, although the overall risk remained exceedingly low due to the rare occurrence of the tumor.<ref name="pmid18984890">{{cite journal |author=de Jong D, Vasmel WL, de Boer JP, ''et al.'' |title=Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma in women with breast implants |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=17 |pages=2030–5 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18984890 |doi=10.1001/jama.2008.585 |url=}}</ref>
