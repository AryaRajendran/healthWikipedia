'''Bloating''' is any abnormal general [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], or increase in diameter of the [[abdomen|abdominal]] area. As a [[symptom]], the patient feels a full and tight abdomen, which may cause [[abdominal pain]], and sometimes accompanied by increased [[borborygmus|stomach growling]] or more seriously the total lack of it.

==Symptoms==
The most common symptom associated with bloating is a sensation that the abdomen is full or distended. Rarely, bloating may be painful or cause shortness of breath.

Pains that are due to bloating will feel sharp and cause the stomach to [[cramp]]. These pains may occur anywhere in the body and can change locations quickly.<ref>[http://mayoclinic.com/health/gas-and-gas-pains/DS00080/DSECTION=symptoms Gas and Gas Pains] Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> They are so painful that they are sometimes mistaken for heart pains when they develop on the upper left side of the chest. Pains on the right side are often confused with problems in the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]] or the [[gallbladder]].

One symptom of gas that is not normally associated with it is the [[hiccup]]. Hiccups are harmless and will diminish on their own; they also help to release gas that is in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] before it moves down to the intestines and causes bloating. Important but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include ascites and tumors.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003123.htm Abdominal Bloating] MedLine Plus.

==Causes==
There are many causes of bloating, including: diet, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, reflux, and constipation, to name a few.

Specific medical conditions like [[Crohn's Disease]] or bowel obstruction can also contribute to the amount of stomach bloating experienced. 

Gas and bloating is a sign that food is not being digested correctly by the body. An inadequate intake of water will cause excessive stomach bloating.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Water benefits the body by aiding with [[digestion]] because it supports a majority of the body's daily functions. Fatty foods cause a formation of fat cells to develop throughout the body and contribute to bloating as well. A build up of fat cells slows down the body's ability to empty the stomach.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Dairy products also contribute to excessive cramps, gas, and bloating.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Persons who are intolerant to lactose products experience this effect more than others. Once these foods are digested, the bloating will fade.

Common causes of abdominal bloating are:

* Overeating
* [[Gastric distension]]
* [[Lactose intolerance]], [[fructose malabsorption|fructose intolerance]] and other [[food intolerance]]s
* [[Food allergy]]
* [[Aerophagia]] (air swallowing, a nervous habit)
* [[Irritable bowel syndrome]]
* Partial [[bowel obstruction]]
* [[Gastric dumping syndrome]] or rapid gastric emptying
* Gas-producing foods
* [[Constipation]]
* [[Visceral fat]]
* [[Splenic-flexure syndrome]]
* [[Menstruation]], [[dysmenorrhea]]
* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] and [[ovarian cyst]]s
* [[Alvarez' syndrome]] (''[[sic]]''), hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without excess of gas in the digestive tract
* Massive infestation with [[intestinal parasite]]s (e.g., [[Ascaris lumbricoides]])
* [[Diverticulosis]]
* [[Celiac Disease]]
* Certain Medications, such as [[phentermine]]
* Occurs in some due to [[salivary gland|salivary]] [[hypersecretion]] and [[dehydration]].

Important but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include 

* large intra-abdominal [[tumors]], such as those arising from cancers of the [[ovarian cancer|ovarian]], [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver]], [[uterine cancer|uterus]] and [[stomach cancer|stomach]]

* [[megacolon]], an abnormal dilation of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] caused by to some diseases, such as [[Chagas disease]], a [[parasite|parasitic]] infection

* [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insufflation of air.

In some animals, like [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s and [[cattle]], gastric dilatation-[[volvulus]], or [[bloat]] also occurs when gas is trapped inside the stomach and a gastric torsion or volvulus prevents it from escaping.

=== Irritable bowel syndrome  ===
Bloating from [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) is of unknown origin but often results from an insult to the gut, and as such can overlap with infective diarrhea, celiac, and [[inflammatory bowel diseases]] ([[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]). IBS is a brain-gut dysfunction that causes visceral hypersensitivity and results in bloating in association with recurrent diarrhea (or constipation) and abdominal pain. While there is no direct treatment for the underlying [[pathology]] of IBS, the symptom of bloating can be well managed through dietary changes that prevent the over-reaction of the gastrocolic reflex. Having soluble [[dietary fiber|fiber]] foods and supplements, substituting [[dairy product|dairy]] with [[soy]] or [[rice]] products, being careful with fresh [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s that are high in insoluble fiber, and eating regular small amounts can all help to lessen the symptoms of IBS (Van Vorous 2000). Foods and beverages to be avoided or minimized include [[red meat]], [[oil]]y, [[fatty]] and [[frying|fried]] products, dairy (even when there is no lactose intolerance), solid chocolate, coffee (regular and decaffeinated), [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[carbonation|carbonated]] beverages, especially those also containing [[sorbitol]], and artificial [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]]s (Van Vorous 2000). IBS is most commonly found in patients around the age of 20 and is found more often in women than men. In people with IBS, the intestines squeeze too hard or not hard enough and cause food to move too quickly or too slowly through the intestines.<ref>[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/digestive/disorders/112.html Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Tips on Controlling Your Symptoms] Family Doctor. Retrieved on 2010-01-19</ref> Other terms used to describe this condition include spastic bowel, spastic colon, and irritable colon. Symptoms of the condition will worsen as a person is placed under stress, during travel, and at other times when the daily routine is tampered with. Common symptoms include bloating, constipation, abdominal [[cramp]] or pain after bowel movement, or feeling like a movement is required even after one has been completed.

=== Fiber ===
Most cases of stomach bloating are due to improper [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]].{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Fiber is made by plants and is not easily digested by the [[human gastrointestinal tract]]. There are two main types of [[dietary fiber]]: soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] and readily fermented in the colon into gases, while insoluble fiber is metabolically inert and absorbs water as it moves through the digestive system, aiding in defecation. Most types of fiber (insoluble) are attached to [[body water]] in the [[intestine]] and increase the volume of stools. Gas occurs because of the bacteria in the colon and is a by-product of soluble fiber digestion. Inadequate or irregular intake of fiber and water will cause a person to experience bloating or constipation. The most common natural sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables as well as wheat or oat bran. These fibers are most likely to cause flatulence.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16336 Fiber And Increased Gas] MedicineNet. Retrieved on 2010-01-19</ref> A diet that is high in fiber will decrease the risk for stomach bloating{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and help keep the body healthy to fight against disease. Soluble fiber, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, from foods such as [[oat bran]], [[whole grain]]s, [[rolled oats]], whole oat [[flour]], [[fat substitutes|oatrim]], and dry milled [[barley]], or [[psyllium seed husks]] (with purity of no less than 95%) may reduce the risk of heart disease.<ref name="FDAc">[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/2lg-xc.html FDA/CFSAN A Food Labeling Guide: Appendix C Health Claims, April 2008]</ref>

=== Belching and flatulence ===
Gas in the gastrointestinal tract has only two sources. It is either swallowed air or is produced by bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines, primarily the colon.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/page2.htm#tocc What Causes Flatulence] MedicineNet. Retrieved on 2010-01-19</ref>

[[Belching]] or burping is a universal ability that works by removing gas from the stomach through the mouth. The stomach can become bloated when too much air is swallowed during eating and drinking too quickly. As the stomach swells, belching removes the gas and alleviates the pain associated with it. Burping can also be used as a form of relief from abdominal discomfort other than too much gas in the stomach.

[[Flatulence]] or farting works much like burping, but helps the body pass gas through the anus instead of the mouth. Bacteria present in the intestinal tract cause gas to be expelled from the anus. They produce the gas as food is digested and moved from the [[small intestine]]. This gas builds up and causes swelling or bloating in the abdominal area before it is released.

=== Constipation ===
A common gastrointestinal problem is [[constipation]] — infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, and/or strain during the movements — which causes serious cases of bloating. Since most cases of constipation are temporary, simple lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and increasing one's intake of fiber, can go a long way toward alleviating constipation.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/constipation/DS00063 Constipation Definition] Mayo Clinic Retrieved on 2010-01-19</ref> Some cases of constipation will continue to worsen and require unconventional methods to release the feces and reduce the amount of stomach bloating. Blood in the stool, intense pain in the abdomen, rectal pain, and unexplained weight loss should be reported to a doctor. Bloating consistently accompanies constipation, and they will not develop without an underlying cause.

=== Heartburn and acid reflux ===
Painful burning sensations in the chest that is caused by gastroesophageal reflux is known as [[heartburn]]. Reflux is the back flow of [[gastric acid]] juices from the stomach into the [[oesophagus]].  Heartburn has different triggers, including certain foods, medications, [[obesity]], and stress. These triggers are different for each individual. [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] or GERD is a chronic condition that can lead to more serious complications like [[esophageal cancer]]. Treatment options are available to treat the symptoms and the condition, but there is no cure for the disease. Symptoms include burping, abdominal and stomach bloating, along with pain and discomfort. Heavy meals, lying down or bending over after eating should be avoided to help prevent reflux from occurring. The stomach bloating experienced with reflux is intense and will remain until the food is digested all the way.

Postmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by [[bacteria]]l action and [[putrefaction]] of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines.

===Related conditions===
Conditions that are related to bloating include [[constipation]], lactose intolerance, and [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|acid reflux disease]]. All of these conditions share the same symptoms and can share the same causative agents. These causes include unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, low amount of exercise, and overall health. Each of these conditions can be experienced as a symptom of the others and is also a cause for each of them. In most cases where one of the conditions is present, there is at least one if not two of the others. Treatment for each condition is performed using the same medications and recommended dietary changes like increased fiber intake and reduced fat intake. If the conditions develop into disease such as gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) or chronic constipation, additional medications will be required. Bloating and flatulence are sometimes related to constipation, and treating the underlying condition may be helpful.<ref>[http://www.gi.org/patients/gihealth/belching.asp Belching Bloating and Flatulence] American College of Gastroenterology.

==Treatment==
There are multiple over the counter medications that can be used to treat bloating. 
Food [[enzyme]]s can be found in some products that will help break down the sugars found in grains, vegetables and [[dairy product]]s. They can be taken before food is consumed or added to the food that causes the gas and bloating. Another type of medicine is [[activated carbon|activated charcoal]] tablets that will decrease the odor from gas.  The most common treatment is [[antacid]]s. These medications have no effect on the gas that is presently in the intestines, but it allows for gas build-up to be belched away more easily, reducing the amount of bloating that develops.  Another treatment is [[Simethicone]], an oral anti-foaming agent that helps the body to expel the gas more quickly.
Also combination of prokinitics like; domperidone+metoclopramide+diphenhydramine (Diphen for prevention of extrapyramidal reactios-specially acute dystonic reaction)+PPI has dramatic effects especially on bloaters and belchers (9).

===Preventing without medicine===
There are several things that can be done to relieve the pressure in the stomach. Taking a walk after eating a meal is a good way to nudge the contents of the bowels along. Exercising releases hormones that work to encourage activity in the [[intestine|bowels]]. Herbal teas are also recommended to break up gas bubbles that can develop.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Drinking extra virgin olive oil helps to stop bloating.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}}
Some foods like coffee and chocolate can stimulate the digestive tract and cause a build up of gas to occur, resulting in bloating.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Meals that are high in fat are often too hard for the system to digest and can stimulate [[spasm]]s and bloating. In addition, foods that are extremely hot or cold can draw air inside as they are being eaten.{{MEDCN|date=April 2012}} Foods like bubble gum or bubbly beverages also cause a build up of air that results in excessive gas and bloating, as does smoking. There are also certain types of vegetables and fruits that contain types of starches which are poorly digested by people but well digested by bacteria.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/page5.htm#tocf How is excessive intestinal gas treated] MedicineNet.
