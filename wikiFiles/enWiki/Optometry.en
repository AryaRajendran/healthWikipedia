In other countries patients are referred to other healthcare professionals, such as [[ophthalmologists]], [[neurologists]] and [[general practitioner|general medical practitioners]] for further treatment or investigation.

==Origin==
The term "optometry" comes from the Greek words ''[[wikt:ὄψις#Ancient Greek|ὄψις]]'' (''opsis''; "view") and ''[[wikt:μέτρον#Ancient Greek|μέτρον]]'' (''metron''; "something used to measure", "measure", "rule"). The root word opto, is a shortened form derived from the Greek word, ophthalmos, meaning, "eye." Like most professions, the practice of optometry [[education]] and [[certification]] is regulated in most countries. Optometrists and optometry-related organizations interact with governmental agencies, other health care professionals, and the community to deliver eye and vision care.

==History==

Optometric history is tied to the development of
* [[vision science]] (related areas of medicine, microbiology, neurology, physiology, psychology, etc.)
* optics, [[History of optics|optical aids]]
* [[optical instrument]]s, imaging techniques
* other [[eye care professional|eye care professions]]

The history of optometry can be traced back to the early studies on optics and image formation by the eye. The origins of optometric science (optics, as taught in a basic physics class) date back a few thousand years BC as evidence of the existence of lenses for [[Decorative arts|decoration]] has been found. It is unknown when the first [[spectacles]] were made, but the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[scientist]] and [[historian]] [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]] stated in his research that the [[China|ancient Chinese]] invented the earliest [[eyeglasses]] 1000 years ago and were also mentioned by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Marco Polo]] in his account of his travels in [[China|ancient China]]. Alternatively, research by David A. Goss in the United States, shows they may have originated independently in the late 13th century in [[Italy]] as stated in a [[manuscript]] from 1305 where a monk from Pisa named Rivalto stated "It is not yet 20 years since there was discovered the art of making eyeglasses".<ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://www.opt.indiana.edu/people/faculty/graphics/goss/opthx.pdf |title=History of Optometry |date=|accessdate=08/03/2010}}</ref> Spectacles were manufactured in Italy, [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] by 1300.

Benito Daza de Valdes published the third book on optometry in 1623, where he mentioned the use and fitting of eyeglasses. In 1692, William Molyneux wrote a book on optics and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] where he stated his ideas on [[myopia]] and problems related to close-up vision. The scientists Claudius Ptolemy and Johannes Kepler also contributed to the creation of optometry. Kepler discovered how the [[retina]] in the eye creates [[Visual perception|vision]]. From 1773 until around 1829, Thomas Young discovered the disability of [[astigmatism]] and it was George Biddell Airy who designed glasses to correct that problem that included spherocylindrical lens.<ref name="B">{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1715.html |title=Thomas Young |date=|accessdate=08/03/2010}}</ref>

Although the term optometry appeared in the 1759 book ''A Treatise on the Eye: The Manner and Phenomena of Vision'' by Scottish physician William Porterfield, it was not until the early twentieth century in the United States and Australia that it began to be used to describe the profession. By the late twentieth century however, marking the distinction with dispensing [[optician]]s, it had become the internationally accepted term.

==Licensing==
Optometry is officially recognized in many jurisdictions.<ref>Agarwal, R. (2000), Optometry as an international profession, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 8(4), 120.</ref> Most have regulations concerning education and practice. Optometrists, like many other health care professionals, are required to participate in ongoing continuing education courses to stay current on the latest standards of care.

{{see also|List of optometry schools}}

===Argentina===
In [[Argentina]] optometrists are required to register with the local Ministry of Public Information, but licensing is not required. Anyone holding a Bachelor's degree may register as an optometrist after completing a written exam. Fees for the exam are set by the provincial government and vary from province to province.

===Australia===
Australia currently has three recognised courses in optometry:
* Bachelor of Optometry Bachelor of Science (BOptom BSc), [[University of New South Wales]]
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[Queensland University of Technology]]
* Doctor of Optometry, [[Melbourne University]] ([[post-graduate]])
These courses are developments of prior course offerings at these institutions that have been expanded along with the increased scope of practice for optometrists in Australia, specifically the ability to prescribe certain therapeutic agents.

New courses are being developed at [[Flinders University]] in South Australia, which accepted students in a science degree in 2010, to begin the post graduate component of the course in 2013.  A second new course is expected at [[Deakin University]] in Geelong, Victoria at the beginning of 2012.

To support these courses the [[Australian College of Optometry]] provides clinical placements to undergraduate students from Australian Universities and abroad.

===Brazil===
The Brazilian Government does not legally recognize optometry as a profession, and the Brazilian Council of Ophthalmology recommends against its official legal recognition.<ref>http://medinfo-study-optometry.blogspot.com/2012/04/brazil.html</ref>

The CBOO (Brazilian Council of Optics and Optometry) wich is affiliated to the WCO (World Council of Optometry), represents brazilian optometrists. In conjunction with organizations representative weight of Brazilian companies, including the National Commerce Confederation for goods, services and tourism (CNC), through the CBÓptica/CNC, its defense arm of optometric and optical industry, are defending the right of free and independent practice of optometrists, even if it is against the interests of ophthalmologists.

The Federal Supreme Court (STF), the Brazilian Court of Justice and the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), another important National Court, ruled several processes granting inquestionable victories to optometrists. 

Opticals, Optometry Centres and Optometry Clinics have nowadays operating permission granted by the health authorities since 2008, when the first Judgement in Supreme Courts grateful for the work of the professionals of optometry. <ref>www.cboo.org.br, www.sindioptica-go.com.br</ref>

===Canada===
In [[Canada]] optometrists must complete a five-year Doctor of Optometry degree from one of two Schools of Optometry (one at the [[University of Waterloo]] and the other at [[Université de Montreal]]). Furthermore, they must pass board licensing examinations to demonstrate their professional skills and knowledge.

Optometrists in Canada are licensed to prescribe topical and oral medications, however, the exact medications that they are licensed to prescribe varies province by province.

===Colombia===

In [[Colombia]] optometry education has been accredited by the Ministry of Health. The last official revision to the laws regarding health care standards in the country was issued in 1992 through the Law 30.<ref>[http://www.cna.gov.co/cont/publicaciones/estandares/salud/anexo_ant_for_pro_cie_sal.htm Consejo Nacional de Acreditación<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Currently there are eight official universities that are entitled by [[ICFES]] to grant the Optometrist certification. The first optometrists arrived in the country from North America and Europe circa 1914. These professionals specialized in optics and [[refraction]]. In 1933, under [[Decree]]s 449 and 1291, the Colombian Government officially set the rules for the formation of professionals in the field of optometry. In 1966 [[La Salle University, Colombia|La Salle University]] opened its first Faculty of Optometry after recommendation from a group of professionals. At the present time optometrists are encouraged to keep up with new technologies through congresses and scholarships granted by the government or the private sector (such as [[Bausch & Lomb]]).

===European Union===

Currently, optometry education and licensing varies throughout Europe. For example, in Germany, optometric tasks are performed by [[ophthalmologist]]s and professionally trained and certified [[optician]]s. In France, there is no regulatory framework and optometrists are sometimes trained by completing an apprenticeship at an ophthalmologists' private office.<ref>[http://www.escrs.org/eurotimes/July2003/French_ophthalmology.asp Welcome to Eurotimes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Since the formation of the [[European Union]], "there exists a strong movement, headed by the Association of European Schools and Colleges of Optometry (AESCO), to unify the profession by creating a European-wide examination for optometry" and presumably also standardized practice and education guidelines within EU countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamakiotes DS, Thal LS |title=The unification of European optometry: how the profession will change after 1992 |journal=J Am Optom Assoc |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=904–13 |year=1991 |month=December |pmid=1814983 }}</ref> The first examinations of the new European Diploma in Optometry were held in 1998 and this was a landmark event for optometry in continental Europe.<ref>Agarwal, R. (1998), European Diploma in Optometry, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 6(3), 84.</ref>

====Greece====

The Hellenic Government does not legally recognize Optometry as a profession, and for this reason has no recognize professional rights. On the other hand, Hellenic Ministry of Education, the year 2006 founded the first department of Optometry at Technological Educational Institute of Patras. After protests from the department of Optics at Technological Educational Institute of Athens (the only department of Optics in Hellas, until 2006), Hellenic Government and Ministry changed the names of the departments to "Optics and Optometry", included lessons both optics and optometry. Optometrists-Opticians have to complete a 4 year undergraduate honours degree. Then the graduates can be admitted to postgraduate courses in Optometry at universities around the world.
 
Institute of Vision & Optics - http://ivo.gr The Institute of Vision and Optics (IVO) of the University of Crete focuses on the sciences of vision and is active in the fields of research, training, technology development and provision of medical services. Professor [[Ioannis Pallikaris]] has received numerous awards and recognitions for the Institute’s contribution to ophthalmology. In 1989 performed the first [[LASIK]] procedure on a [[human eye]].

Finally, there are many sites and blogs for optometry such as http://www.optometria.gr/, http://optics-optometry.blogspot.gr/, http://vision-optometry.blogspot.gr/.

====Republic of Ireland====

The profession of Optometry has been represented for over a century by the Association of Optometrists, Ireland [AOI]. In [[Ireland]] an optometrist must first complete a four-year degree in optometry at D.I.T. Kevin Street. Following successful completion of the a degree, an optometrist must then complete Professional Qualifying Examinations to enter the register of the Opticians Board [Bord na Radharcmhaistoiri]. Optometrists must be registered with the Board to practice in the Republic of Ireland.

The A.O.I. runs a comprehensive continuing education and professional development program on behalf of Irish optometrists. The legislation governing Optometry was drafted in 1956. Some feel that the legislation restricts optometrists from using their full range of skills, training and equipment for the benefit of the Irish public. The amendment to the Act in 2003 addressed one of the most significant restrictions: the use of [[cycloplegic]] drugs to examine children.

====Italy====
The Italian Government does not legally recognise optometry as a health profession; anyway the highest court recognize that "optometry can be practiced, given that there are no law that prohibit it". It is taught at seven universities: Padua, Turin, Milan, Lecce, Florence, Naples and Rome, as three years course (like a BSc) of "Scienze e tecnologie fisiche" as sector of the Physics Department. Additionally, there are courses available at some private institutions (as at Vinci Institute near Firenze, that starts courses in 1969) which offer advanced professional education for already qualified opticians (most of the italian optometrist are also qualified opticians, i.e. "ottico abilitato"). The fit-to-practice is granted by the study title itself (i.e.: "titolo abilitante") after an exam; there is no professional councils nor registry nor regulamentary bodies, other than the government Ministry of Health itself.

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], optometrists have to complete a 3 or 4 ([[Scotland]]) year undergraduate honours degree followed by a minimum of a one-year "pre-registration period", (internship), where they complete clinical practice under the supervision of a qualified and experienced practitioner. During this year the pre-registration candidate is given a number of quarterly assessments, often including temporary posting at a hospital, and on successfully passing all of these assessments, a final one-day set of examinations (Examination details correct for candidates from 2006 onwards). Following successful completion of these assessments and having completed one year's supervised practice, the candidate is eligible to register as an optometrist with the [[General Optical Council]] (GOC) and, should they so wish, are entitled to membership of the [[College of Optometrists]]. Registration with the GOC is mandatory to practice in the UK. Members of the College of Optometrists (incorporated by a Royal Charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II) may use the suffix MCOptom.  Nine universities offer Optometry in the UK: [[Anglia Ruskin University|Anglia Ruskin]], [[Aston University|Aston]], [[University of Bradford|Bradford]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], [[City University London|City]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Ulster at Coleraine]] and [[University of Plymouth]].

Additionally, the [[Institute of Optometry]] in London offers a post-graduate professional doctorate in optometry in partnership with [[London South Bank University]].<ref>Agarwal, R. (2008), Integrating theory with practice, Optician, Volume 236, number 6167, page 12.</ref>

===Ghana===
The [[Ghana Optometric Association]] (GOA) regulates the practise of [[Optometry in Ghana]]. After the six-year training at any of the two Universities offering the course, the O.D degree is awarded. The new Optometrist must write a qualifying exam, after which the optometrist is admitted as a member of the GOA, leading to the award of the title MGOA.

===Mozambique===
The first optometry course in [[Mozambique]] was started in 2009 at Universidade Lurio, [[Nampula]]. The course is part of the Mozambique Eyecare Project. [[University of Ulster]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] and International Centre for Eyecare Education are supporting partners.

===Norway===
In Norway the optometric profession has been regulated as a healthcare profession since 1988. After a three-year bachelor program one can practice basic optometry. At least one year in clinical practice qualify for a post-degree half-year sandwich course in contact lens fitting, which is regulated as a healthcare specialty. A separate regulation for the use of diagnostic drugs in optometric practice was introduced in 2004.

===Philippines===
Optometry is regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission of the Philippines. To be eligible for licensing, each candidate must have satisfactorily completed a Doctor of Optometry course at an accredited institution and demonstrate good moral character with no previous record of professional misconduct. Professional organizations of optometry in the Philippines include Optometric Association of the Philippines<ref>http://philippineoptometry.net/</ref> and Integrated Philippine Association of Optometrists, Inc. (IPAO).

===Russia===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
In [[Russia]] optometry education has been accredited by the Federal Agency of Health and Social Development.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
There are only two educational institutions that teach optometry in Russia: Saint Petersburg Medical Technical College, formerly known as St. Petersburg College of Medical Electronics and Optics, and The Helmholz Research Institute for Eye Diseases. They both belong and are regulated by the Ministry of Health. The Optometry program is a four-year program. It includes one to two science foundation years, one year focused on clinical and proficiency skills, and one year of clinical rotations in hospitals. Graduates take college/state [[examinations]] and then receive a specialist [[diploma]]. This diploma is valid for only five years and must be renewed every five years after receiving additional training at state accredited programs.

The scope of practice for optometrists in Russia includes: refraction, contact lens fitting, spectacles construction and lens fitting (dispensing), low vision aids, foreign body removal, referrals to other specialists after clinical condition diagnoses (management of diseases in the eye).

===India===
In 1958, two schools of optometry were established, one at Gandhi Eye Hospital, Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh and the other one at Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh, under the second five-year plan by Director General of Health Services of Government of India. These schools offered Diploma in Optometry courses of two years duration. Subsequently four more schools were opened across India situated at Sitapur Eye Hospital, Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, Chennai (formerly Madras) in Tamil Nadu, Bangaluru (formerly Bangalore) in Karnataka and Thiruvanthipuram (formerly Trivandrum) in Kerala.<ref>Agarwal, R. K. (1970), Optometry in India, The Optician, July 3, page 18 (published in London, England).</ref>  Elite School of Optometry (ESO) was established in 1985 at Chennai and was the first to offer a four-year degree course. 

The four-year degree courses are offered in well established schools and institutions including All India Institute of Medical Sciences - New Delhi; Shri Prakash Institute of Optometry attached to Dr. Agarwal's Eye Hospital - Chennai; Elite School of Optometry attached to Shankar Netralaya - Chennai; Bausch and Lomb School attached to L. V. Prasad Eye Institute - Hyderabad; College of Optometry & Ophthalmic Science, Nasik Maharashtra,Bharati Vidyapeeth University Medical College - Pune; Manipal College of Allied Health Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal; Dr. D.Y. Patil Institute of Optometry - Pimpri, Pune; Lotus College of Optometry at Mumbai; Nethradhama school of optometry, Bangalore; Sankara College of Optometry in the state of Karnataka launched under the aegis of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences and Dr.Anand College of Optometry and Vision Science at Salem, Tamil Nadu in collaboration with Periyar University. Presently more colleges and schools of optometry in India are offering a four-year degree course based on the CMOC curriculum endorsed by the ASCO.-http://asco-india.org/

India needs approximately 115,000 optometrists. Currently India has approximately 9000 optometrists (four-year trained) and 40,000 eye care personnel (two-year trained).<ref>Anon (2010), Organization and Institution News, Plan to boost Indian optometry endorsed, Optometry and Vision Science, Volume 87, Number 7, page 520.</ref> In order to prevent blindness or visual impairment more well trained optometrists are required in India.<ref>Anon (2011), Eye care for 11 million vision impaired children in India, Optometry and Vision Science,  Volume 88, number 12, page 1532.</ref> It should be noted that definition of optometry differs considerably in different countries of the world.<ref>Agarwal, R. K. (1985), Optometry in the Indian sub-continent, Optometry Today, Volume 25, No. 14, page 475 (published by the Association of Optometrists, London, England)</ref> India needs more optometry schools offering four-year degree courses with a syllabus similar to that in force in those countries where optometry is very well established with an internationally accepted definition.

===United States===
Doctors of Optometry in the United States are currently regulated by state boards that determine their scope of practice, which may vary from state to state. Within the healthcare system, optometrists function as primary eye care providers who are especially experienced in fitting contact lenses and glasses prescriptions. 

Optometrists can also treat their patients that have eye diseases with:
*Oral medications <ref>{{cite news |author=AOA |title=Prescription of oral medications for treatment of eye diseases |url=https://www.aoa.org/Images/oral.gif |work=aoa.org |publisher=American Optometric Association |date=February 27, 2012 }}</ref> (such as antivirals, antibiotics, oral steroids and pain medications<ref>{{cite news |author=AOA |title=Prescription of narcotic medications for treatment of eye diseases |url=https://www.aoa.org/Images/Controlled-Substance.gif |work=aoa.org |publisher=American Optometric Association |date=February 27, 2012 }}</ref>)
*Topical medications such as prescription eye drops to treat glaucoma<ref>{{cite news |author=AOA |title=Treatment of glaucoma by state |url=https://www.aoa.org/Images/glaucoma.gif |work=aoa.org |publisher=American Optometric Association |date=February 27, 2012 }}</ref> or red eye for example.
*Injectable medications.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hedger, Brian |title=Several states face battles over optometry scope of practice |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2009/04/13/prsb0413.htm |work=amednews.com |publisher=American Medical Association |date=April 13, 2009 }}</ref> 

Optometrists may also be trained in some surgical techniques, including those for foreign body removal, corneal injury, eyelid & lacrimal disease, removal of "lumps and bumps" around the eyes<ref>{{cite news |author=KOA |title=New laws allowing ODs to perform surgery |url=http://www.kyeyes.org/faq.html |work=kyeyes.org |publisher=Kentucky Optometric Association |date=February 27, 2012 }}</ref> and others.  In Oklahoma, the state optometry board also allows state-certified optometrists to perform surgeries limited to the anterior segment of the eye. In Kentucky, recent legislation permits Optometrists to perform a multitude of laser procedures. In many cases optometrists and ophthalmologists work together in the treatment and management of patients with various eye conditions.  [[Opticians]] in America generally dispense corrective eye wear, and in some cases also construct the corrective eye wear.  The scope of practice in optometry varies as it is regulated by each state.

The American Optometric Association (AOA) and the American Optometric Society (AOS) represent optometrists nationally in the USA.  Prior to admittance into optometry school, optometrists typically complete four years of undergraduate study, culminating in a bachelor’s degree. Required undergraduate coursework for pre-optometry students covers a variety of health, science and mathematics courses. These courses include: four [[semester]]s of chemistry to include organic and biochemistry, two semesters of physics and biology, as well as one semester of calculus, statistics, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, and psychology. Additional requirements are imposed by specific institutions. Once completing these courses, admission to an optometry doctorate program requires that candidates score well on the [[Optometry Admission Test (O.A.T.)|O.A.T.]], Optometry Admission Tests. There are currently [[List_of_optometry_schools#United_States_of_America|20 optometry schools in the United States]], and admission into these schools is highly competitive.

Optometrists are required to complete a four-year postgraduate degree program to earn their Doctor of Optometry (O.D. - Oculus Doctor) titles. The four-year program includes classroom and clinical training in geometric, physical, physiological and ophthalmic optics, ocular anatomy, ocular disease, ocular pharmacology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the vision system, binocular vision, color, form, space, movement and vision perception, design and modification of the visual environment, and vision performance and vision screening.  In addition, an optometric education also includes a thorough study of human anatomy, systemic diseases, general pharmacology, general pathology, microbiology, sensory and perceptual psychology, biochemistry, statistics and epidemiology. There are three new colleges of optometry ([[Midwestern University]] Arizona College of Optometry, University of the Incarnate Word School of Optometry, [[Western University of Health Sciences]] College of Optometry) that have received the pre-accreditation status of preliminary approval from the Accreditation Council on Optometric Education (ACOE).  Programs with "Preliminary Approval" have shown that they are developing within the ACOE's standards. The programs have approval to begin recruiting and admitting students, and to begin offering the program.<ref>http://www.aoa.org/x5130.xml</ref>

Upon completion of an accredited program in optometry, graduates hold the Doctor of Optometry degree. Optometrists must then pass a national examination administered by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry (NBEO).<ref>http://www.optometry.org/passfail.cfm</ref> The three-part exam includes basic science, clinical science and patient care. (The structure and format of the NBEO exams are subject to change beginning in 2008.) Some optometrists go on to complete one- to two-year residencies with training in a specific sub-specialty such as [[pediatric]] eyecare, geriatric eyecare, specialty contact lens, ocular disease or neuro-optometry. All optometrists are required to fulfill continuing education requirements to stay current regarding the latest standards of care.
