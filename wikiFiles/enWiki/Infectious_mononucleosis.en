'''Infectious mononucleosis''' ('''IM'''; also known as '''EBV infectious mononucleosis''', '''Pfeiffer's disease''', '''Filatov's disease''',<ref name="wni1811">{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1811}}</ref> and sometimes colloquially as the '''kissing disease''' from its oral transmission or simply as '''mono''' in [[North America]] and as '''glandular fever''' in other English-speaking countries) is an infectious,  widespread [[viral disease]] caused by the [[Epstein–Barr virus]] (EBV), one type of [[herpesviridae|herpes virus]], to which more than 90% of adults have been exposed.<ref>http://www.kenyon.edu/x26163.xml</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2012}} Occasionally, the symptoms can recur at a later period.<ref name="Epstein-Barr Virus"/> Most people are exposed to the virus as children, when the disease produces no noticeable or only flu-like symptoms. In developing countries, people are exposed to the virus in early childhood more often than in developed countries.  As a result, the disease in its observable form is more common in developed countries. It is most common among adolescents and young adults.<ref name="Health.state.ny.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/mononucleosis/fact_sheet.htm |title=Infectious Mononucleosis (mono, EBV mononucleosis) |publisher=Health.state.ny.us |date= |accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref>

Especially in [[adolescent]]s and young adults, the disease is characterized by [[fever]], sore throat and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], along with several other possible signs and symptoms. It is primarily diagnosed by observation of symptoms, but suspicion can be confirmed by several diagnostic tests.

The syndrome was described as an infectious process by [[Nil Filatov]] in 1887 and independently by [[Emil Pfeiffer]] in 1889.<ref name="wni1811" /><ref>Н.

Infectious mononucleosis was first described by [[Sprunt and Evans]] in the Bulletin of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in 1920. They described the clinical characteristics of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis. At the time, their article was entitled "Mononuclear leukocytosis in reaction to acute infection (infectious mononucleosis)," because the causative organism, EBV, had yet to be described.<ref>Sprunt TPV, Evans FA.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Main symptoms of Infectious mononucleosis.png|thumb|Main symptoms of IM<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis/page2.htm#3whatare MedicineNet - infectious mononucleosis article] Retrieved on 7 Mars, 2009</ref><ref name=webMD>[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/infectious-mononucleosis-symptoms WebMD > Infectious Mononucleosis] Last Updated: September 19, 2007.

The classic symptoms of mononucleosis are a sore throat, [[fever]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[malaise]], [[Human pharynx|pharyngeal]] inflammation, vomiting, [[petechia]]e and loss of appetite. Common signs include [[lymphadenopathy]] (enlarged [[lymph nodes]]), [[splenomegaly]] (enlarged [[spleen]]), [[hepatitis]] (refers to inflammation of hepatocytes—cells in the liver) and [[hemolysis]] (the bursting of [[red blood cell]]s). Older adults are less likely to have a sore throat or lymphadenopathy, but are instead more likely to present with [[hepatomegaly]] (enlargement of the liver) and [[jaundice]]. Rarer signs and symptoms include [[thrombocytopenia]] (lower levels of [[platelet]]s), with or without [[pancytopenia]] (lower levels of all types of blood cells), [[splenic rupture]], splenic hemorrhage, upper airway obstruction, [[pericarditis]] and [[pneumonitis]]. Another rare manifestation of mononucleosis is [[erythema multiforme]].<ref name="OHCM">{{cite book | last=Longmore | first=Murray | coauthors=Ian Wilkinson, Tom Turmezei, Chee Kay Cheung | title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, 7th edition | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2007 | page=389 | isbn=0-19-856837-1 }}</ref><ref name="AFP">{{cite journal | author = Ebell MH | title = Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 1279–87 | year = 2004 | month = November| pmid = 15508538}}</ref>

Mononucleosis is sometimes accompanied by secondary [[cold agglutinin disease]], an [[autoimmune disease]] in which abnormal circulating antibodies directed against [[red blood cell]]s can lead to a form of [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]. The cold agglutinin detected is of [[Ii antigen system|anti-i]] specificity.<ref name="Mayo_Textbook">{{cite book |author=Ghosh, Amit K.; Habermann, Thomas |title=Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Concise Textbook |publisher=Informa Healthcare |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4200-6749-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author= Rosenfield RE |coauthors= Schmidt PJ, Calvo RC, McGinniss MH |title= Anti-i, a frequent cold agglutinin in infectious mononucleosis |journal= Vox Sanguinis |volume= 10 |issue= 5 |pages= 631–634 |doi= 10.1111/j.1423-0410.1965.tb01418.x |pmid= 5864820 |year= 1965}}</ref> Patients with infectious mononucleosis are sometimes misdiagnosed with a streptococcal pharyngitis (because of the classical clinical triad of fever, [[pharyngitis]] and [[Lymphadenopathy|adenopathy]]) and are given antibiotics such as [[ampicillin]] or [[amoxicillin]] as treatment. Some studies indicate about 80–90% of patients with acute [[Epstein–Barr virus]] infection treated with such antibiotics develop a red, diffuse rash.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kagan | first=B | title=Ampicillin rash |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=333–335 |year=1977 | pmid=855325 | pmc=1237570}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Infectious mononucleosis occurs with infection by the [[Epstein–Barr virus]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000067375|infectious mononucleosis}}</ref>

The infection is spread via [[saliva]], and has an [[incubation period]] of four to seven weeks.<ref name="pmid8710247">{{cite journal |author=Cozad J |title=Infectious mononucleosis |journal=The Nurse Practitioner |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=14–6, 23, 27–8 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8710247 |doi= 10.1097/00006205-199603000-00002|url= }}</ref> Symptoms usually persist for two to three weeks,<ref name="Glandular fever">{{cite web | title = Glandular fever - NHS | url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Glandular-fever/Pages/Introduction.aspx | publisher = [[National Health Service (NHS)]] | date = 2010-09-09 | accessdate = 2010-09-09 }}</ref> but can last for a couple of months. Fatigue symptoms often persist after the other symptoms have subsided.<ref name="Health.state.ny.us"/>

The length of time that an individual remains [[Contagious disease|contagious]] is unclear, but the chances of passing the illness to someone else may be the highest during the first six weeks following infection. Some studies indicate that a person can spread the infection for many months after symptoms are completely gone, with one particular study indicating as long as 18 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/infections/common/mono_contagious.html |title=How Long Is Mono Contagious? |publisher=Kidshealth.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref>

The virus replicates first within [[epithelium|epithelial cell]]s in the [[Human pharynx|pharynx]] (which causes [[pharyngitis]], or sore throat), and later primarily within [[B cell]]s (which are invaded via their [[Complement receptor 2|CD21]]). The host immune response involves cytotoxic (CD8-positive) [[T cell]]s against infected B lymphocytes, resulting in enlarged, atypical lymphocytes ([[Reactive lymphocyte|Downey cells]]).<ref name="eMedicine">{{eMedicine|ped|705}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kcom.edu/faculty/chamberlain/Website/lectures/lecture/mono.htm Infectious mononucleosis]</ref>

When the infection is acute (recent onset, instead of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]), [[heterophile]] [[antibodies]] are produced.<ref name=AFP/>

Similar symptoms can be caused by [[cytomegalovirus]], [[adenovirus]], and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', but will result in a negative [[heterophile antibody test]].<ref name="Epstein-Barr Virus">{{cite web |url= http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/ebv.htm |title= Epstein-Barr Virus and Infectious Mononucleosis |date= 16 |month= May |year= 2006 |work= CDC A–Z Index |publisher= National Center for Infectious Diseases |accessdate= December 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorhams.dk/html/the_lymphatic_system.html | title=The Lymphatic System |publisher=Lymphangiomatosis & Gorham's disease Alliance |accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MonoThroat.JPG|thumb|[[Exudative]] [[pharyngitis]] in a person with infectious mononucleosis]]
[[File:Lymphadanopathy.JPG|thumb|Cervical [[lymphadenopathy]] in a patient with infectious mononucleosis]]
The most commonly used diagnostic criterion is the presence of 50% lymphocytes with at least 10% atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]),<ref name=OHCM/> while the person also has fever, pharyngitis and [[adenopathy]]. Furthermore, it should be confirmed by a [[serology|serological test]].<ref name=AFP/> The atypical lymphocytes resembled monocytes when they were first discovered, thus the term "mononucleosis" was coined. Diagnostic tests are used to confirm infectious mononucleosis, but the disease should be suspected from symptoms prior to the results from [[hematology]].<ref name="Hoagland">{{cite journal | author = Hoagland RJ | title = Infectious mononucleosis | journal = Primary care | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 295–307 | year = 1975 | month = June | pmid = 1046252 | doi = | url = }}</ref> These criteria are specific; however, they are not particularly [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] and are more useful for research than for clinical use. Only half the patients presenting with the symptoms held by mononucleosis and a positive [[heterophile antibody]] test ([[monospot test]]) meet the entire criteria. One key procedure is to differentiate between infectious mononucleosis and mononucleosis-like symptoms.

A few studies on infectious mononucleosis have been conducted in a primary care environment, the best of which studied 700 patients, of which 15 were found to have mononucleosis upon a heterophile antibody test. More useful in a diagnostic sense are the signs and symptoms themselves. The presence of [[splenomegaly]], and posterior cervical, [[wikt:Special:Search/axillary|axillary]] and [[Inguinal lymph node|inguinal]] adenopathies are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. On the other hand, the absence of cervical adenopathy and fatigue are the most useful to dismiss the idea of infectious mononucleosis as the correct diagnosis. The insensitivity of the physical examination in detecting [[splenomegaly]] means it should not be used as evidence against infectious mononucleosis.<ref name=AFP/>

In the past, the most common test for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis was the heterophile antibody test, which involves testing heterophile antibodies by agglutination of guinea pig, sheep and horse red blood cells. As with the aforementioned criteria, this test is specific but not particularly [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] (with a [[false-negative]] rate of as high as 25% in the first week, 5–10% in the second and 5% in the third).<ref name=AFP/> About 90% of patients have heterophile antibodies by week 3, disappearing in under a year. The [[antibody|antibodies]] involved in the test do not interact with the Epstein–Barr virus or any of its [[antigen]]s.<ref name=OHCM/> More recently, more sensitive tests have been developed, such as the [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG) and [[immunoglobulin M]] (IgM) tests. IgG, when positive, reflects a past infection, whereas IgM reflects a current infection. When negative, these tests are more accurate in ruling out infectious mononucleosis. However, when positive, they feature similar sensitivities to the heterophile antibody test. Therefore, these tests are useful for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis in people with highly suggestive symptoms and a negative heterophile antibody test. Another test searches for the [[EBV nuclear antigen|Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen]], while it is not normally recognizable until several weeks into the disease, and is useful for distinguishing between a recent-onset of infectious mononucleosis and symptoms caused by a previous infection. Elevated hepatic [[transaminase]] levels is highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, occurring in up to 50% of patients.<ref name=AFP/>

A [[fibrin ring granuloma]] may be present.

===Differential diagnosis===
Diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis should also take into consideration [[acute cytomegalovirus infection]] and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' infections. These diseases are clinically very similar by their signs and symptoms. Because their management is much the same, it is not always helpful, or possible, to distinguish between EBV mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infection. However, in pregnant women, differentiation of mononucleosis from toxoplasmosis is associated with significant consequences for the [[fetus]].

Acute [[HIV infection]] can mimic signs similar to those of infectious mononucleosis, and tests should be performed for pregnant women for the same reason as toxoplasmosis.<ref name=AFP/>

Other conditions from which to distinguish infectious mononucleosis include [[leukemia]], [[tonsillitis]], [[diphtheria]], [[common cold]] and [[influenza]] (flu).<ref name=OHCM/>

==Treatment==
Infectious mononucleosis is generally [[self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]], so only symptomatic and/or supportive treatments are used.<ref name="Merck18">{{cite book |editors=Beers MH, Porter RS, Jones TV, Kaplan JL, Berkwits M, editors. |title=The Merck manual of diagnosis and therapy |edition=18th |publisher=Merck Research Laboratories |location=Whitehouse Station (NJ) |year=2006 |isbn=0-911910-18-2 |author=Mark H. Beers ...}}</ref> Rest is recommended during the acute phase of the infection, but activity should{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} be resumed once acute symptoms have resolved. Nevertheless, heavy physical activity and contact sports should be avoided to mitigate the risk of [[splenic rupture]], for at least one month following initial infection or [[splenomegaly]] has resolved, as determined by a treating physician.<ref name=webMD/>

===Medications===
In terms of pharmacotherapies, [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]], such as [[ibuprofen]], may be used to reduce fever and pain. [[Prednisone]], a [[corticosteroid]], is commonly used as an anti-inflammatory to reduce symptoms of [[Human pharynx|pharyngeal]] pain, [[odynophagia]], or enlarged [[tonsils]], although its use remains controversial due to the rather limited benefit and the potential of side effects.<ref>National Center for Emergency Medicine Informatics - Mononucleosis http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0314.htm</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Candy B, Hotopf M |title=Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=3 |issue= 3|pages=CD004402 |year=2006 |pmid=16856045 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004402.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Candy |editor1-first=Bridget}}</ref> Intravenous [[corticosteroid]]s, usually [[hydrocortisone]] or [[dexamethasone]], are not recommended for routine use<ref>{{cite journal | author=Candy B, Hotopf M. | year=2006 | issue=4 | pages=CD004402 | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | title=Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis | pmid=16856045 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004402.pub2 | volume=3 | editor1-last=Candy | editor1-first=Bridget }}</ref> but may be useful if there is a risk of airway obstruction, severe [[thrombocytopenia]], or [[hemolytic anemia]].<ref name="WebMD">{{cite web |title=Infectious Mononucleosis |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/infection/hw168622.asp |date= January 24, 2006 |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref><ref name="TGAntibiotic13">Antibiotic Expert Group.

[[Penicillin]] or other antibiotics (with the exception of the two mentioned above) should be administered to treat the strep throat.

Once the acute symptoms of an initial infection disappear, they often do not return.  But once infected, the patient carries the virus for the rest of his or her life.  The virus typically lives dormantly in B lymphocytes.  Independent infections of mononucleosis may be contracted multiple times, regardless of whether the patient is already carrying the virus dormantly. Periodically, the virus can reactivate, during which time the patient is again infectious, but usually without any symptoms of illness.<ref name="Epstein-Barr Virus"/> Usually, a patient has few, if any, further symptoms or problems from the latent B lymphocyte infection.  However, in susceptible hosts under the appropriate environmental stressors, the virus can reactivate and cause vague physical symptoms (or may be subclinical), and during this phase the virus can spread to others.<ref name="Epstein-Barr Virus"/><ref>{{cite journal |author= Sitki-Green D, Covington M, Raab-Traub N |title= Compartmentalization and Transmission of Multiple Epstein-Barr Virus Strains in Asymptomatic Carriers |journal= Journal of Virology |year= 2003 |volume= 77 |issue= 3 |pages= 1840–1847 |doi= 10.1128/JVI.77.3.1840-1847.2003 |pmid= 12525618 |pmc= 140987 |month= February; 77(3):}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Hadinoto V, Shapiro M, Greenough TC, Sullivan JL, Luzuriaga K, Thorley-Lawson DA |title= On the dynamics of acute EBV infection and the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis |journal= Blood |date= February 1, 2008 |series= |volume= 111 |issue= 3|pages= 1420–1427|doi= 10.1182/blood-2007-06-093278 |pmid= 17991806 |pmc= 2214734}}</ref>
