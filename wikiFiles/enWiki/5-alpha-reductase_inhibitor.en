'''5α-reductase inhibitor'''s are a group of medications with [[antiandrogen]]ic activity, used in [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[prostate cancer]], [[androgenic alopecia|male pattern baldness]], and [[hormone replacement therapy]] (male to female) for [[trans woman|transgendered women]]. 

These drugs decrease the levels of available [[5-alpha reductase|5α-reductase]], thus reducing the products of its enzymatic reaction. Specific substrates that it enzymatically converts include [[testosterone]], [[progesterone]], [[androstenedione]], epi-testosterone, [[cortisol]], [[aldosterone]], and [[deoxycorticosterone]]. 5α-reductase inhibition is most known for preventing conversion of [[testosterone]], the male [[sex hormone]], to the more potent [[dihydrotestosterone]] in [[androgenic]] disorders.

5α-Reductase inhibitors are clinically used in the treatment of conditions that are exacerbated by [[dihydrotestosterone]]:<ref name="Rossi">Rossi S (Ed.) (2004). ''[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2004''. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook. ISBN 0-9578521-4-2</ref>

Note that the use of 5-α reductase inhibition is controversial in prostate cancer, as some authors have expressed concern that it may inadvertently lead to development of more aggressive neoplastic variants.

==Adverse reactions==
In general, [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) experienced with 5α-reductase inhibitors are dose-dependent. Common ADRs include [[impotence]], decreased [[libido]], decreased ejaculate volume, [[major depression|depression]], and [[anxiety]]. Rare ADRs include breast tenderness and enlargement ([[gynecomastia]]), and [[allergy|allergic]] reaction.<ref name="Rossi"/><ref name="pmid17026771">{{cite journal | author = Rahimi-Ardabili B, Pourandarjani R, Habibollahi P, Mualeki A | title = Finasteride induced depression: a prospective study | journal = [[BMC Clinical Pharmacology]] | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17026771 | pmc = 1622749 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6904-6-7 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6904/6/7}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
The pharmacology of 5α reductase inhibition is complex, but involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate. Specific substrates include [[testosterone]], [[progesterone]], [[androstenedione]], epi-testosterone, [[cortisol]], [[aldosterone]], and [[deoxycorticosterone]]. The entire physiologic effect of their reduction is unknown, but likely related to their excretion or is itself physiologic.<ref name="Azz"/> Beyond being a catalyst in the [[rate-limiting step]] in testosterone reduction, 5alpha-reductase enzyme isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to dihydroprogesterone (DHP) and deoxycorticosterone to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3alpha-reduction of DHT, DHP and DHDOC lead to steroid metabolites with effect on cerebral function by enhancing [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] GABAergic inhibition. These neuroactive steroid derivatives enhance GABA at GABA(A) receptors and have anticonvulsant, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and also alter sexual and alcohol related behavior.<ref>{{cite pmid|16834758}}</ref> 5α-dihydrocortisol is present in the [[aqueous humor]] of the eye, is synthesized in the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]], and might help make the aqueous humor itself.<ref name="Cort">{{cite journal | author = Weinstein BI, Kandalaft N, Ritch R, Camras CB, Morris DJ, Latif SA, Vecsei P, Vittek J, Gordon GG, Southren AL | title = 5 alpha-dihydrocortisol in human aqueous humor and metabolism of cortisol by human lenses in vitro | journal = Invest.

Inhibition of the enzyme can be classified into two categories: steroidal and nonsteroidal. The steroidal class has more inhibitors with examples including finasteride (MK-906), dutasteride (GG745), 4-MA, turosteride, MK-386, MK-434, and MK-963. Several have pursued synthesis of nonsteroidals to inhibit 5α-reductase due to the undesired side effects of steroidals. The most potent and selective inhibitors of 5α-R1 are found in this class, and include benzoquinolones, nonsteroidal aryl acids, butanoid acid derivatives, and more recognizably, [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (especially [[gamma-linolenic acid]]), [[zinc]], and [[green tea]].<ref name="Azz">Azzouni F, Godoy A, Li Y, Mohler J. ''et al.'' The 5 alpha-reductase isozyme family: a review of basic biology and their role in human diseases. Adv Urol. 2012;2012:530121. PMID 22235201</ref>

Inhibition of 5α-reductase results in decreased conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by reducing the Δ4,5 double-bond. This, in turn increases levels of testosterone and  [[estradiol]]. [[Gynecomastia]], [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], are some possible side-effects of 5α-reductase inhibition.

Other enzymes compensate to a degree for the absent conversion, specifically with local expression at the skin of reductive 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, oxidative 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes.<ref>{{cite pmid|11399532}}</ref>

In [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), DHT acts as a potent cellular [[androgen]] and promotes [[prostate]] growth; therefore, it inhibits and alleviates symptoms of BPH. In alopecia, male-pattern baldness is an effect of androgenic receptor activation, so reducing levels of DHT also reduces alopecia.
