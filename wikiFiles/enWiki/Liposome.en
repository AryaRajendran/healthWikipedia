[[Image:Liposome.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Liposomes are composite structures made of phospholipids and may contain small amounts of other molecules. Though liposomes can vary in size from low micrometer range to tens of micrometers, unilamellar liposomes, as pictured here, are typically in the lower size range with various targeting ligands attached to their surface allowing for their surface-attachment and accumulation in pathological areas for treatment of disease.<ref name=Torchilin >{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2006.09.009 | title = Multifunctional nanocarriers | year = 2006 | last1 = Torchilin | first1 = V | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 14 | pages = 1532–55 | pmid = 17092599}}</ref>]]

A '''liposome''' is an artificially-prepared [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]  composed of a [[lipid bilayer]]. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for [[Route of administration|administration]] of [[nutrient]]s and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.<ref>[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/CellMembranes.html Kimball's Biology Pages,] "Cell Membranes."</ref>  Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes (such as by [[sonication]]).

Liposomes are often composed of [[phosphatidylcholine]]-enriched [[phospholipid]]s and may also contain mixed lipid chains with [[surfactant]] properties such as [[Egg (food)|egg]] [[Phospholipid#Phosphatidyl ethanolamine|phosphatidylethanolamine]]. A liposome design may employ surface [[ligand]]s for attaching to unhealthy tissue.<ref name=Torchilin/>

The major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle.<ref>[http://www.twst.com/notes/articles/wac609.html Explanation on twst.com commercial page, cf. also Int.Patent PCT/US2008/074543 on p.4, section 0014]</ref>

Liposomes should not be confused with [[micelle]]s and [[Micelle#Reverse Micelles|reverse micelles]] composed of [[monolayer]]s.<ref name="Stryer S. 1981 Biochemistry, 213">Stryer S. (1981) Biochemistry, 213</ref>

==Discovery==
Liposomes were first described by British haematologist [[Alec Douglas Bangham|Alec D Bangham]]<ref>{{cite pmid|14187392}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|14098499}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|13966357}}</ref> in 1961 (published 1964), at the Babraham Institute, in Cambridge. They were discovered when Bangham and R. W. Horne were testing the institute's new [[electron microscope]] by adding [[negative stain]] to dry phospholipids. The resemblance to the [[plasmalemma]] was obvious, and the microscope pictures served as the first real evidence for the cell membrane being a bilayer lipid structure.

The word ''liposome'' derives from two Greek words: ''lipo'' ("fat") and ''soma'' ("body"); it is so named because its composition is primarily of phospholipid.

==Mechanism==
A liposome encapsulates a region of aqueous solution inside a [[hydrophobic]] membrane; dissolved [[hydrophilic]] [[solutes]] cannot readily pass through the lipids. Hydrophobic chemicals can be dissolved into the membrane, and in this way liposome can carry both hydrophobic molecules and hydrophilic molecules. To deliver the molecules to sites of action, the lipid bilayer can fuse with other bilayers such as the [[cell membrane]], thus delivering the liposome contents. By making liposomes in a solution of [[DNA]] or [[medication|drugs]] (which would normally be unable to [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the membrane) they can be (indiscriminately) delivered past the lipid bilayer. A liposome does not necessarily have [[lipophobic]] contents, such as water, although it usually does.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Liposomes are used as models for artificial cells. Liposomes can also be designed to deliver drugs in other ways. Liposomes that contain low (or high) [[pH]] can be constructed such that dissolved aqueous drugs will be [[charge (physics)|charged]] in solution (i.e., the pH is outside the drug's [[Isoelectric point|pI]] range). As the pH naturally neutralizes within the liposome ([[protons]] can pass through some membranes), the drug will also be neutralized, allowing it to freely pass through a membrane. These liposomes work to deliver drug by [[diffusion]] rather than by direct cell fusion. 

A similar approach can be exploited in the biodetoxification of drugs by injecting empty liposomes with a transmembrane pH gradient. In this case the vesicles act as sinks to scavenge the drug in the blood circulation and prevent its toxic effect.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/nn101924a | title = Transmembrane pH-Gradient Liposomes to Treat Cardiovascular Drug Intoxication | year = 2010 | last1 = Bertrand | first1 = Nicolas | last2 = Bouvet | first2 = CéLine | last3 = Moreau | first3 = Pierre | last4 = Leroux | first4 = Jean-Christophe | journal = ACS Nano | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = 7552–8 | pmid = 21067150}}</ref>
Another strategy for liposome drug delivery is to target [[endocytosis]] events. Liposomes can be made in a particular size range that makes them viable targets for natural [[macrophage]] [[phagocytosis]]. These liposomes may be [[digested]] while in the macrophage's [[phagosome]], thus releasing its drug. Liposomes can also be decorated with [[opsonin]]s and [[ligand]]s to activate endocytosis in other cell types.

The use of liposomes for transformation or [[transfection]] of DNA into a host cell is known as [[lipofection]].

In addition to gene and drug delivery applications, liposomes can be used as carriers for the delivery of dyes to textiles,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18770074 | year = 2008 | last1 = Barani | first1 = H | last2 = Montazer | first2 = M | title = A review on applications of liposomes in textile processing | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–62 | doi = 10.1080/08982100802354665 | journal = Journal of liposome research}}</ref> pesticides to plants, enzymes and nutritional supplements to foods, and cosmetics to the skin.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19072018 | year = 2009 | last1 = Meure | first1 = LA | last2 = Knott | first2 = R | last3 = Foster | first3 = NR | last4 = Dehghani | first4 = F | title = The depressurization of an expanded solution into aqueous media for the bulk production of liposomes | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 326–37 | doi = 10.1021/la802511a | journal = Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids}}</ref>

Liposomes are also used as outer shells of some microbubble contrast agents used in [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]].

== Dietary and nutritional supplements ==
Regarding the use of liposomes as a carrier of dietary and nutritional supplements; until very recently the use of liposomes were primarily directed at [[targeted drug delivery]].  However, the versatile abilities of liposomes are now being discovered in other settings.  Liposomes are presently being cleverly implemented for the specific oral delivery of certain dietary and nutritional supplements.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yoko Shojia, Hideki Nakashima | title = Nutraceutics and Delivery Systems | journal = Journal of Vitamin Delivery Targeting | year = 2004}}</ref> 

A very small number of dietary and nutritional supplement companies are currently pioneering the benefits of this unique science towards this new application.  This new direction and employment of liposome science is in part due to the low absorption and [[bioavailability]] rates of traditional oral dietary and nutritional tablets and capsules.  The low oral bioavailability and absorption of many nutrients is clinically well documented.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15640487 | year = 2005 | last1 = Williamson | first1 = G | last2 = Manach | first2 = C | title = Bioavailability and bioefficacy of polyphenols in humans. II. Review of 93 intervention studies | volume = 81 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 243S–255S | journal = The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref> Therefore the natural [[Molecular encapsulation|encapsulation]] of [[lypophilic]] and [[hydrophilic]] nutrients within liposomes has made for a very effective method of bypassing the destructive elements of the [[gastric system]] and aiding the encapsulated nutrient to be delivered to the cells and tissues.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Bender, David A. | title = Nutritional Biochemistry of Vitamins | location = Cambridge, U.K. | year = 2003}}</ref>

It is important to note that certain influential factors have far reaching effects on the percentage of liposome that are yielded in manufacturing.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 6994593 | year = 1980 | last1 = Szoka Jr | first1 = F | last2 = Papahadjopoulos | first2 = D | title = Comparative properties and methods of preparation of lipid vesicles (liposomes) | volume = 9 | pages = 467–508 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bb.09.060180.002343 | journal = Annual review of biophysics and bioengineering}}</ref>  These influences also have an effect on the actual amount of realized liposome entrapment and the actual quality of the liposomes themselves.  These are very crucial elements which lead to the long term stability of the liposomes.  These complex yet significant factors are the following:  (1) The actual manufacturing method and preparation of the liposomes themselves; (2) The constitution, quality, and type of raw [[phospholipid]] used in the formulation and manufacturing of the liposomes; (3) The ability to create homogeneous liposome particle sizes that are stable and hold their encapsulated payload.  These primary and key elements comprise the foundation of an effective liposome carrier for use in increasing the bioavailability of oral dosages of dietary and nutritional supplements.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15027802 | year = 2004 | last1 = Chaize | first1 = B | last2 = Colletier | first2 = JP | last3 = Winterhalter | first3 = M | last4 = Fournier | first4 = D | title = Encapsulation of enzymes in liposomes: High encapsulation efficiency and control of substrate permeability | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–75 | journal = Artificial cells, blood substitutes, and immobilization biotechnology | doi = 10.1081/BIO-120028669}}</ref>

Liposomes, which use a form [[nanotechnology]] science, also impressively and harmoniously, use the generalized nature of the liposomes themselves to increase the [[efficacy]], bioavailability, absorption, and delivery of these certain entrapped dietary and nutritional supplements.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/bi00686a012 | title = Structural studies on phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol mixed vesicles | year = 1975 | last1 = Newman | first1 = George C. | last2 = Huang | first2 = Ching-Hsien | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 15 | pages = 3363–70 | pmid = 1170890}}</ref> The generalized nature and makeup of phospholipid composed liposomes adroitly complement the natural lining of nearly every cell within the human body.<ref>{{cite book | author = Alberts, Bruce | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 1 | year = 1989}}</ref> This therefore creates a natural bond and or affinity for the liposomes to deliver their onboard “payload” to the cells.  The quality of raw [[Lipid]] used in the preparation and manufacturing of the liposomes therefore precisely co-relates to this natural congruency between the liposomes and the cells of the human body.<ref>K Imaizumi, Digestive Absorption and Physiological Activity of Phospholipids in Clinical Nutrition, (1985)</ref>

==Manufacturing==
The correct choice of liposome preparation method depends on the following parameters:<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.trac.2005.07.006 | title = Analytical methods for the control of liposomal delivery systems | year = 2006 | last1 = Gomezhens | first1 = A | last2 = Fernandezromero | first2 = J | journal = TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 167}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18951288 | year = 2008 | last1 = Mozafari | first1 = MR | last2 = Johnson | first2 = C | last3 = Hatziantoniou | first3 = S | last4 = Demetzos | first4 = C | title = Nanoliposomes and their applications in food nanotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–27 | doi = 10.1080/08982100802465941 | journal = Journal of liposome research}}</ref> 
# the physicochemical characteristics of the material to be entrapped and those of the liposomal ingredients;
# the nature of the medium in which the lipid vesicles are dispersed
# the effective concentration of the entrapped substance and its potential toxicity;
# additional processes involved during application/delivery of the vesicles;
# optimum size, polydispersity and shelf-life of the vesicles for the intended application; and,
# batch-to-batch reproducibility and possibility of large-scale production of safe and efficient liposomal products
Formation of liposomes and nanoliposomes is not a spontaneous process. Lipid vesicles are formed when phospholipids such as lecithin are placed in water and consequently form one bilayer or a series of bilayers, each separated by water molecules, once enough energy is supplied.<ref>{{cite book | author = Mozafari, M.R.  and Mortazavi, S.M. | year = 2005 | title = Nanoliposomes: From Fundamentals to Recent Developments | publisher = Trafford Publishing Ltd | location = Oxford, UK}}</ref> 

Liposomes can be created by [[sonication|sonicating]] [[phosphatidylcholine]] rich phospholipids in water.<ref name="Stryer S. 1981 Biochemistry, 213"/> Low [[shear rate]]s create multilamellar liposomes, which have many layers like an onion. Continued high-shear sonication tends to form smaller [[unilamellar liposome]]s. In this technique, the liposome contents are the same as the contents of the aqueous phase. Sonication is generally considered a "gross" method of preparation as it can damage the structure of the drug to be encapsulated. Newer methods such as extrusion and Mozafari method <ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17689087 | year = 2007 | last1 = Colas | first1 = JC | last2 = Shi | first2 = W | last3 = Rao | first3 = VS | last4 = Omri | first4 = A | last5 = Mozafari | first5 = MR | last6 = Singh | first6 = H | title = Microscopical investigations of nisin-loaded nanoliposomes prepared by Mozafari method and their bacterial targeting | volume = 38 | issue = 8 | pages = 841–7 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2007.06.013 | journal = Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)}}</ref> are employed to produce materials for human use.

==Prospect==
Further advances in liposome research have been able to allow liposomes to avoid detection by the body's immune system, specifically, the cells of [[reticuloendothelial system]] (RES). These liposomes are known as "[[stealth liposome]]s", and are constructed with PEG ([[Polyethylene glycol|Polyethylene Glycol]]) studding the outside of the membrane. The PEG coating, which is [[inert]] in the body, allows for longer circulatory life for the drug delivery mechanism.  However, research currently seeks to investigate at what amount of PEG coating the PEG actually hinders binding of the liposome to the delivery site.  In addition to a PEG coating, most stealth liposomes also have some sort of biological species attached as a ligand to the liposome in order to enable binding via a specific expression on the targeted drug delivery site. These targeting ligands could be [[monoclonal antibodies]] (making an immunoliposome), [[vitamin]]s, or specific [[antigen]]s. Targeted liposomes can target nearly any cell type in the body and deliver drugs that would naturally be systemically delivered. Naturally toxic drugs can be much less toxic if delivered only to diseased tissues. [[Polymersome]]s, morphologically related to liposomes, can also be used this way.

In case of tumor development, certain anticancer drugs such as [[doxorubicin]] (Doxil) and [[daunorubicin]] are provided through liposomes.  Liposomal [[cisplatin]] has received [[orphan drug]] designation for pancreatic cancer from EMEA.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
