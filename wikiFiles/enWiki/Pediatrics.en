'''Pediatrics''' (or '''paediatrics''') is the branch of [[medicine]] that deals with the medical care of [[infant]]s, [[child]]ren, and [[adolescent]]s. A [[physician|medical practitioner]] who specializes in this area is known as a '''pediatrician''', or '''paediatrician'''. The word ''pediatrics'' and its [[cognates]] mean ''healer of children''; they derive from two [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:παῖς|παῖς]]}} (''pais'' = child) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰατρός|ἰατρός]]}} (''iatros'' = doctor or healer).

In the United States, a ''pediatrician'' (US spelling) is often a [[general practitioner|primary care physician]] who specializes in children, whereas in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] a ''paediatrician'' (British spelling) generally is a [[medical specialist]] not in primary general practice.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

In the [[Western world]], the first generally accepted pediatric hospital is the ''Hôpital des Enfants Malades'' ([[French language|French]]: Hospital for Sick Children), which opened in Paris in June 1802 on the site of a previous orphanage.<ref name="Ballbriga">{{Cite book|last1= Ballbriga |first1= Angel |editor1-first= Burford L.

This example was only gradually followed in other European countries. The [Charité] (a hospital founded in 1710) in [[Berlin]] established a separate Pediatric Pavilion in 1830, followed by similar institutions at [Saint Petersburg] in 1834, and at [[Vienna]] and ''Breslau'' now [Wrocław], both in 1837. The English-speaking world waited until 1852 for its first pediatric hospital, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street]], some fifty years after the founding of its namesake in Paris.<ref name="Ballbriga" /> In the USA, the first similar institutions were the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]], which opened in 1855, and then [[Boston Children's Hospital]] (1869).<ref name = "Pearson">{{Cite book|last1= Pearson |first1= Howard A. |editor1-first= Burford L.

==Differences between adult and pediatric medicine==
The body size differences are paralleled by maturational changes. The smaller body of an [[infant]] or [[neonate]] is substantially different physiologically from that of an adult. Congenital defects, genetic variance, and developmental issues are of greater concern to pediatricians than they often are to adult physicians.

A major difference between pediatrics and adult medicine is that children are minors and, in most [[jurisdiction]]s, cannot make decisions for themselves. The issues of [[guardianship]], privacy, legal responsibility and informed consent must always be considered in every pediatric procedure. In a sense, pediatricians often have to treat the parents and sometimes, the family, rather than just the child. Adolescents are in their own legal class, having rights to their own health care decisions in certain circumstances. In basic terms, pediatricians take care of all of the children's needs from emotional support to medical support.

==Training of pediatricians==
The training of pediatricians varies considerably across the world.
Depending on jurisdiction and university, a medical degree course may be either undergraduate-entry or  graduate-entry. The former commonly takes five or six years, and has been usual in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Entrants to graduate-entry courses (as in the USA), usually lasting four or five years, have previously completed a three- or four-year university degree, commonly but by no means always in sciences. Medical graduates hold a degree specific to the country and university in and from which they graduated. This degree qualifies that medical practitioner to become licensed or registered under the laws of that particular country, and sometimes of several countries, subject to requirements for "[[medical intern|internship]]" or "conditional registration".
Pediatricians must undertake further training in their chosen field. This may take from four to eight or more years, (depending on jurisdiction and the degree of specialization). The post-graduate training for a [[primary care physician]], including primary care pediatricians, is generally not as lengthy as for a hospital-based [[medical specialist]].
In most jurisdictions, entry-level degrees are common to all branches of the medical profession, but in some jurisdictions, specialization in pediatrics may begin before completion of this degree. In some jurisdictions, pediatric training is begun immediately following completion of entry-level training. In other jurisdictions, junior medical doctors must undertake [[generalist]] (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing pediatric (or any other) [[Specialty (medicine)|specialization]]. Specialist training is often largely under the control of '''pediatric organizations''' (see below) rather than universities,and depending on jurisdiction.

* [[Pediatric neuropsychology]]
