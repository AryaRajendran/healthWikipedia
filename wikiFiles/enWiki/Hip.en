In [[vertebrate]] [[anatomy]], '''hip''' (or "coxa"<ref name="Diab-77">Latin ''coxa'' was used by [[Celsus]] in the sense "hip", but by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the sense "hip bone" (Diab, p 77)</ref> in medical terminology) refer to either an anatomical region or a joint.

The '''hip region''' is located [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] to the gluteal region (i. e. the buttock), inferior to the [[iliac crest]], and overlying the [[greater trochanter]] of the [[femur]], or "thigh bone".<ref name="MediLexicon">MediLexicon</ref> In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the [[hip bone]] which forms part of the hip region.

The '''hip joint''', scientifically referred to as the '''acetabulofemoral joint''' (''art. coxae''), is the [[joint]] between the femur and [[acetabulum]] of the [[pelvis]] and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e. g. standing) and dynamic (e. g. walking or running) postures. The hip joints are the most important part in retaining balance. The [[pelvic inclination angle]], which is the single most important element of human body posture, is adjusted at the hips.

The five or so tubercles and the lower lateral borders of the [[sacrum]], and the [[Tuberosity of the ischium|ischial tuberosity]] ("sitting bone").<ref name="Field-80">Field (2001), p 80</ref>

* Proximally the femur is largely covered by muscles and, as a consequence, the [[greater trochanter]] is often the only palpable bony structure. Distally on the femur some more palpable bony structures are the condyles.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-381">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 381</ref>

=== Articulation ===

[[File:Hueftgelenk-gesund.jpg|thumb|Radiograph of a healthy human hip joint]]

<!-- Hip joint redirects here -->
The hip joint is a [[synovial joint]] formed by the articulation of the rounded [[Femur head|head of the femur]] and the cup-like [[acetabulum]] of the pelvis. It forms the primary connection between the bones of the lower limb and the [[axial skeleton]] of the trunk and pelvis. Both joint surfaces are covered with a strong but lubricated layer called articular hyaline [[cartilage]].
<!-- - no refs above - -->
The cuplike acetabulum forms at the union of three pelvic bones {{mdash}} the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], and [[ischium]].<ref name="Faller-174">Faller (2004), pp 174-175</ref> The Y-shaped growth plate that separates them, the triradiate cartilage, is fused definitively at ages 14–16.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-365">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 365</ref> It is a special type of spheroidal or [[ball and socket joint]] where the roughly spherical femoral head is largely contained within the acetabulum and has an average radius of curvature of 2.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-378">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 378</ref> The acetabulum grasps almost half the femoral ball, a grip augmented by a ring-shaped fibrocartilaginous lip, the [[acetabular labrum]], which extends the joint beyond the equator.<ref name="Faller-174" />
The head of the femur is attached to the shaft by a thin neck region that is often prone to fracture in the elderly, which is mainly due to the degenerative effects of [[osteoporosis]].

{{double image|right|Hip-transverse-angle-000.svg|88|Hip-sagittal-angle-000.svg|140|Transverse and sagittal angles of acetabular inlet plane.}}

The acetabulum is oriented inferiorly, laterally and anteriorly, while the femoral neck is directed superiorly, medially, and anteriorly.

=== Articular angles ===

* The ''transverse angle of the acetabular inlet'' (also called ''Sharp's angle'' and is generally the angle referred to by ''acetabular angle'' without further specification)<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739474/figure/F0002/ Figure 2] in: {{cite journal |author=Saikia KC, Bhuyan SK, Rongphar R |title=Anthropometric study of the hip joint in northeastern region population with computed tomography scan |journal=Indian J Orthop |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=260–6 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=19753150 |pmc=2739474 |doi=10.4103/0019-5413.39572 |url=}}</ref> can be determined by measuring the angle between a line passing from the superior to the inferior acetabular rim and the horizontal plane; an angle which normally measures 51° at birth and 40° in adults, and which affects the acetabular lateral coverage of the femoral head and several other parameters.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-379"/>
* The ''sagittal angle of the acetabular inlet'' is an angle between a line passing from the anterior to the posterior acetabular rim and the sagittal plane. It measures 7° at birth and increases to 17° in adults.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-379">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=mTOhk3m06IoC&pg=PA379 Page 379]</ref>
* Wiberg's ''centre-edge angle'' (CE angle) is an angle between a vertical line and a line from the centre of the femoral head to the most lateral part of the acetabulum,<ref name=DaviesJohnsonWhitehouse2006>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rxS9EjeGhrMC&pg=PA131 Page 131] in: {{cite book |author=Whitehouse, Richard |title=Imaging of the hip & bony pelvis: techniques and applications |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=3-540-20640-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> as seen on an [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anteroposterior]] [[radiograph]].<ref name=Chosa2003>[http://web.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/reprint/85-B/6/826] {{cite pmid|12931799}} </ref>
* The ''vertical-centre-anterior margin angle'' (VCA) is an angle formed from a vertical line (V) and a line from the centre of the femoral head (C) and the anterior (A) edge of the dense shadow of the subchondral bone slightly posterior to the anterior edge of the acetabulum, with the radiograph being taken from the ''false angle'', that is, a lateral view rotated 25 degrees towards becoming frontal.<ref name=Chosa2003/>
* The ''articular cartilage angle'' (AC angle, also called Hilgenreiner angle) is an angle formed parallel to the weight bearing dome, that is, the acetabular ''[[wikt:sourcil|sourcil]]'', and the horizontal plane,<ref name=DaviesJohnsonWhitehouse2006/> or a line connecting the corner of the triangular cartilage and the lateral acetabular rim.<ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/5/17/figure/F2 Figure 2] in: {{cite doi|10.1186/1471-2431-5-17}}</ref>

=== Femoral neck angle ===

The angle between the longitudinal axes of the femoral neck and shaft, called the '''caput-collum-diaphyseal angle''' or CCD angle, normally measures approximately 150° in newborn and 126° in adults (''coxa norma'').<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-367">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 367</ref>{{Dubious|date=April 2011}}

An abnormally small angle is known as ''[[coxa vara]]'' and an abnormally large angle as ''[[coxa valga]]''. Because changes in shape of the femur naturally affects the knee, ''coxa valga'' is often combined with ''[[genu varum]]'' (bow-leggedness), while ''coxa vara'' leads to ''[[genu valgum]]'' (knock-knees).<ref name="Platzer-196">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=196}}</ref>

[[File:Coxa-valga-norma-vara-000.svg|thumb|250px|Changes in trabecular patterns due to altered CCD angle. Coxa valga leads to more compression trabeculae, coxa vara to more tension trabeculae.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-367" />]]

Changes in CCD angle is the result of changes in the stress patterns applied to the hip joint. Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, changes the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones. Two continuous trabecular systems emerging on auricular surface of the [[sacroiliac joint]] meander and criss-cross each other down through the hip bone, the femoral head, neck, and shaft.

* In the hip bone, one system arises on the upper part of auricular surface to converge onto the posterior surface of the [[greater sciatic notch]], from where its trabeculae are reflected to the inferior part of the acetabulum. The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.
* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head. The other system lines up with a system in the femur stretching from the medial part of the femoral shaft to the superior part of the femoral head.<ref name="Palastanga-353">Palastanga (2006), p 353</ref><!-- - ref for entire section above - -->

On the lateral side of the hip joint the [[fascia lata]] is strengthened to form the [[iliotibial tract]] which functions as a tension band and reduces the bending loads on the proximal part of the femur.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-367" />

=== Capsule ===

: ''Main article: [[Capsule of hip joint]]''

The capsule attaches to the hip bone outside the acetabular lip which thus projects into the capsular space. On the femoral side, the distance between the head's cartilaginous rim and the capsular attachment at the base of the neck is constant, which leaves a wider extracapsular part of the neck at the back than at the front.<ref>Because the neck is wider in front than at the back.</ref>
<ref name="Platzer-198">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=198}}</ref>

The strong but loose fibrous capsule of the hip joint permits the hip joint to have the second largest range of movement (second only to the [[shoulder]]) and yet support the weight of the body, arms and head.

The capsule has two sets of fibers: longitudinal and circular.

* The circular fibers form a collar around the femoral neck called the [[zona orbicularis]].
* The longitudinal retinacular fibers travel along the neck and carry blood vessels.

=== Ligaments ===
{{double image|right|Gray339.png|100|Gray340.png|100|Extracapsular ligaments. Anterior (left) and posterior (right) aspects of right hip.}}

{{double image|right|Gray341.png|100|Gray342.png|100|Intracapsular ligament. Left hip joint from within pelvis with acetabular floor removed (left); right hip joint with capsule removed, anterior aspect (right).}}

The hip joint is reinforced by five ligaments, of which four are extracapsular and one intracapsular.

The '''extracapsular''' ligaments are the [[Iliofemoral ligament|iliofemoral]], [[ischiofemoral ligament|ischiofemoral]], and [[pubofemoral ligament]]s attached to the bones of the pelvis (the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.
<ref name="Platzer-198" />
In the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.
<ref name="Platzer-200">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>
The [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it. The zona orbicularis acts like a buttonhole on the femoral head and assists in maintaining the contact in the joint.
<ref name="Platzer-198" />
All three ligaments become taut when the joint is extended - this stablises the joint, and reduces the energy demand of muscles when standing <ref>http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/</ref>

The '''intracapsular''' ligament, the [[Ligament of head of femur|ligamentum teres]], is attached to a depression in the acetabulum (the acetabular notch) and a depression on the femoral head (the fovea of the head). It is only stretched when the hip is dislocated, and may then prevent further displacement.
<ref name="Platzer-198" />
It is not that important as a ligament but can often be vitally important as a conduit of a small artery to the head of the femur, that is, the {{visible anchor|foveal artery}}.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/825363-overview#aw2aab6b2b4 Hip Fracture in Emergency Medicine] at Medscape. Author: Moira Davenport. Updated: Apr 2, 2012</ref> This artery is not present in everyone but can become the only blood supply to the bone in the head of the femur when the neck of the femur is fractured or disrupted by injury in childhood.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-383">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), pp 383, 440</ref>

=== Blood supply ===

The hip joint is supplied with blood from the [[Medial circumflex femoral artery|medial circumflex femoral]] and [[Lateral circumflex femoral artery|lateral circumflex femoral]] arteries, which are both usually branches of the [[Profunda femoris artery|deep artery of the thigh]] (profunda femoris), but there are numerous variations and one or both may also arise directly from the [[femoral artery]]. There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e. g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-383" />

The hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur. These anastomoses exist between the femoral artery or profunda femoris and the gluteal vessels.<ref name="Clemente-227">Clemente (2006), p 227</ref>

=== Muscles and movements ===
{{main|Muscles of the hip}}

The hip muscles act on three mutually perpendicular main axes, all of which pass through the center of the [[femur head|femoral head]], resulting in three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and three pair of principal directions: [[Flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] around a transverse axis (left-right); [[lateral rotation]] and [[medial rotation]] around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] and [[adduction]] around a sagittal axis (forward-backward); <ref name="Thieme-Atlas-386">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 386</ref> and a combination of these movements (i. e. [[Anatomical terms of motion#Other special motions|circumduction]], a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).<ref name="Platzer-200" />
It should be noted that some of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.
<ref name=Platzer_244>{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=244-246}}</ref>
<ref name="Platzer-244">Platzer (2004), pp 244-246</ref>
Additionally, the [[Inferior gemellus muscle|inferior]] and [[Superior gemellus muscle|superior gemelli]] may be termed ''triceps coxae'' together with the [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]], and their function simply is to assist the latter muscle.<ref name="Platzer-238">Platzer (2004), p 238</ref>

The movements of the hip joint is thus performed by a series of muscles which are here presented in order of importance<ref name="Platzer-244" /> with the range of motion from the neutral zero-degree position<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-386" /> indicated:

* '''Lateral''' or '''external rotation''' (30° with the hip extended, 50° with the hip flexed): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]; [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]; dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[iliopsoas]] (including [[psoas major muscle|psoas major]] from the vertebral column); [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|brevis]], and [[Adductor minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.
* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40°): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fascia latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].
* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20°): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].
* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140°): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fascia latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.
* '''Abduction''' (50° with hip extended, 80° with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fascia latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.
* '''Adduction''' (30° with hip extended, 20° with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.

== Sexual dimorphism and cultural significance ==

[[File:Canova-Dancer with her hands on her hips 45degree view.jpg|thumb|Dancers often stand with hands on hips.]]

In humans, unlike other animals, the hip bones are substantially different in the two sexes. The hips of human females widen during [[puberty]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref><!-- - ref does not support female hips are wider - --> The [[femur|femora]] are also more widely spaced in females, so as to widen the opening in the hip bone and thus facilitate childbirth. Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.

The female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.
