'''Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy''' ('''BHRT'''), also known as '''bioidentical hormone therapy''' or '''natural hormone therapy''', is a poorly defined term referring to the use of [[hormone]]s that are identical, on a [[molecule|molecular]] level, with [[endogeny|endogenous]] hormones in [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]]. The term is also associated with pharmacy [[compounding]], blood or [[saliva testing]], efforts to reach a targeted level of hormones in the body (as established through blood or saliva testing) and unfounded claims of safety and efficacy.  Specific hormones used in BHRT include [[estrone]], [[estradiol]], [[progesterone]] (which are available both in [[approved drug|FDA-approved]] manufactured products and as pharmacy-compounded products) [[testosterone]], [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (both products have more limited availability and approval in Canada and the United States) and [[estriol]] (which is available in Europe but is not approved in Canada and the United States).

Custom-compounded BHRT is a practice almost wholly restricted to the United States.<ref name = Cirigliano/> BHRT is a form of [[alternative medicine]], and has been promoted as a [[panacea (medicine)|panacea]] for many diseases rather than a means of relieving the symptoms of [[menopause]] and/or reducing the risk of [[osteoporosis]] (the goals of traditional hormone replacement therapy). There is no evidence to support these claims; the hormones are expected to have the same risks and benefits of comparable approved drugs for which there is an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence base]] and extensive research and regulation. The exception is progesterone, which may have an improved safety profile, though direct comparisons with [[progestin]]s have not been made. Bioidentical hormones may also present extra risks, due to the process of compounding. In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing has not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched.

The International Menopause Society, [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], [[Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada]], [[The Endocrine Society]],  [[North American Menopause Society|the North American Menopause Society (NAMS)]], [[United States Food and Drug Administration]], American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, [[American Medical Association]], [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[Mayo Clinic]] have released statements that there is a lack of evidence that the benefits and risks of bioidentical hormones are different from well-studied nonbioidentical counterparts; until such evidence is produced the risks should be treated as if they were similar; and that compounded hormone products may have additional risks related to compounding. A major safety concern in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is that there is no requirement to include package inserts, despite the potential for serious adverse effects (including life-threatening adverse effects)  associated with HRT. This can lead to consumers' being deceived (and harmed), as they are misled into believing that BHRT is safe and has no side effects. Regulatory bodies require pharmacies to include important safety information with conventional hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) via package inserts.

==History==
Bioidentical hormones were first used for menopausal symptom relief in the 1930s,<ref name = Cirigliano/> after Canadian researcher [[James Collip]] developed a method to extract an orally-active estrogen from the urine of pregnant women and marketed it as the active agent in a product called Emmenin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Noble RL |title=J. B. Collip, 1893-1965 |journal=J. Reprod. Fertil. |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=167–70 |year=1966 |month=April |pmid=5328022 |doi= 10.1530/jrf.0.0110167|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/reprint/11/2/167.pdf | format = pdf}}{</ref> It was supplanted on the market when its manufacturer, Ayerst (later [[Wyeth]] Pharmaceuticals), began producing the more easily manufactured conjugated [[equine]] estrogens in 1941 under the brand name [[Premarin]]; by 1992, Premarin was the most widely prescribed drug in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.solaltech.com/doctors/3/HOT%20OFF%20THE%20PRESS%20Premarin-The_Intriguing_History_of_a_Controversial_Drug.pdf | format = pdf | last = Vance | first = DA | journal = International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding | title = Premarin: The Intriguing History of a Controversial Drug | year = 2007 | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–287 }}</ref>

In the 1970s, research and reports indicating risks from synthetic conjugated estrogens began to appear. Investigation determined that the addition of a [[progestogen]] to estrogen treatment reduced the risks.  As early as 1980, the ''British Medical Journal'' (now ''[[BMJ]]'') recommended oral bioidentical progesterone as an option when side effects from synthetic progestogens otherwise mandated discontinuing treatment.  Starting in 1980, side effects caused by synthetic progestin use prompted more research into bioidentical progesterone.<ref name = Schwartz>{{cite journal | last=Schwartz | first = E | coauthors = Holtorf K |title=Hormones in Wellness and Disease Prevention: Common Practices, Current State of the Evidence, and Questions for the Future| pmid = 18928825  | journal=Prim Care Clin Office Pract  | year = 2008 | volume = 35 | pages = 669–705 | doi = 10.1016/j.pop.2008.07.015 | url = http://www.hormoneandlongevitycenter.com/nss-folder/pictures/Holtorf-Med-Clinics.pdf | format = pdf | issue=4}}</ref> In May 1998 the FDA approved [[Prometrium]], an oral bioidentical progesterone product produced by [[Solvay (company)|Solvay Pharmaceutical]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/33644485.html?dids=33644485:33644485&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+03%2C+1998&author=Marie+McCullough%2C+Philadelphia+Inquirer.&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=HORMONE+OPTIONS&pqatl=google | title = Hormone Options | last = McCullough | first = M | date = 1998-09-03 | accessdate = 2009-12-16 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | pages = 7 }}</ref>

Physicians John R. Lee and [[Jonathan Wright (physician)|Jonathan Wright]] were pioneers in the area of BHRT.<ref name = Rosenthalethical/> Lee authored several popular books on BHRT<ref name = Watt>{{cite journal |author=Watt PJ, Hughes RB, Rettew LB, Adams R |title=A holistic programmatic approach to natural hormone replacement |journal=Fam Community Health |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=53–63 |year=2003 |pmid=12802128 |doi= 10.1097/00003727-200301000-00007|url=}}</ref> and promoted custom-compounded BHRT, with the goal of achieving what he called a "natural hormone balance".  He based this goal on the clinical testing of saliva to establish where "deficiencies" existed, though agencies such as the FDA and the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] state that blood and saliva testing is unreliable and biologically meaningless.<ref name = Cirigliano/>  Lee also believed that progesterone acted as a [[panacea]]<ref name = Fugh2007/> and general health tonic for many health conditions; he based his claims on anecdotal data rather than peer-reviewed research,<ref name = Watt/> and there have been no clinical trials demonstrating this to be true.<ref name = Fugh2007/>  Wright also authored a popular book on BHRT;<ref name = Rosenthalethical/> he promoted a triple-estrogen formula he called "Triest", which combined the three estrogens (of over 25 types) found in human females: [[estriol]], [[estradiol]] and [[estrone]]. Previous bioidential formulas had used only estradiol.  This triple formula was based on a single unpublished study whose conclusions did not take into account how estrogens are processed and excreted in the body&mdash;particularly how the liver processes oral estrogens, converting many of them to estrone.  No followup was performed by Wright to replicate these observations.<ref name = Cirigliano/>  Wright may have been the first proponent of BHRT to use the term "bioidentical"—the word he coined to describe unpatentable, plant-derived molecules he believed were identical to human hormones.  However, no [[Crystallography|structural crystallographic]] evidence has been used to support the idea that these molecules are actually identical to endogenous human hormones.  When the [[Women's Health Initiative]]'s reports on the unappreciated risks of equine estrogens were released, many prescribers of BHRT used Wright's assertions (and his terminology) to proclaim the superiority of bioidentical molecules despite a lack of scientifically supported evidence.  Following the publication of a popular book written by actress [[Suzanne Somers]] in 2006, the term "bioidentical" gained more prominence in popular consciousness as a "poorly understood new adjective" regarding hormone replacement therapy.<ref name = Rosenthalethical/>

==Terminology==
There is no single definition for the term "bioidentical hormone replacement therapy" (BHRT); it is generally used to refer to 17β-estradiol, but other uses include plant-based or compounded estrogen products that blend estradiol with estriol and sometimes with estrone.<ref name = Taylor2005/>  A "bioidentical hormone" is defined as a molecule identical to a hormone [[endogeny|produced by the human body]]<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Schwartz/> (though not all allegedly bioidentical hormones sold by custom-compounding pharmacies are necessarily molecularly identical to endogenous humans<ref>{{cite pmid | 22205711 }}</ref>).  Despite the term "bioidentical" being used in FDA packaging inserts since before 1998,<ref name = Schwartz/> the FDA considers "BHRT" to be a marketing term and does not recognize its use.<ref name = FDAmyth/> The meaning of "plant-derived" has also been attached to the term "bioidentical",<ref name = FDAFAQ>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCompounding/ucm183088.htm | title = Compounded Menopausal Hormone Therapy Questions and Answers | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | date = 2009-09-23 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] }}</ref> and it may also mean that the hormones are "natural"; throughout the 1990s plant-derived, compounded hormones were referred to as "natural hormone therapy".<ref name = Rosenthalethical/> However, the term "natural" can be applied to all products where the principal ingredient originates from an animal, plant, or mineral source, and both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones can be produced from the same plant sources.<ref name = Harvard>{{cite news| url = https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/What-are-bioidentical-hormones.htm | title = What are bioidentical hormones? | work = Harvard Women's Health Watch | date = 2006-08-01 | accessdate = 2009-02-27 | publisher = [[Harvard Medical School]] }}</ref>

"BHRT" is often used to refer to a set of diagnostic, prescribing, preparation and marketing practices including [[compounding]] (the preparation of custom-mixed hormones by a pharmacist, according to a prescription), saliva testing, and efforts to counter the effects of aging rather than relieving the symptoms of menopause. This compounded BHRT package has been promoted by Suzanne Sommers, Oprah Winfrey and other proponents as safer and more effective than CHRT,<ref name = Endocrinesociety>{{cite web|title=The Endocrine Society- Position Statement: Bioidentical Hormones | format = pdf | date = 2006-10-01 | accessdate = 2009-02-29 | url = http://www.endo-society.org/advocacy/policy/upload/BH_Position_Statement_final_10_25_06_w_Header.pdf | publisher = [[The Endocrine Society]]}}</ref><ref name = Kalvaitis>{{cite journal |last=Kalvaitis |first=K | title = Compounded hormone therapies: unproven, untested - and popular | journal = Endocrine Today | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | year = 2008| url = http://www.endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=27231 |format=web reprint }}</ref><ref name = McBane2008>{{cite journal | last = McBane | first = SE | year = 2008 | title = Easing vasomotor symptoms: Besides HRT, what works? | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Physicians Assistants | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 26–31 | pmid = 18468366 }}</ref><ref name = Rosenthal2008/><ref name = FDA/><ref name = Boothby2004>{{cite journal | last = Boothby | first = LA | coauthors = Doering PL; Kipersztok S | year = 2004 | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review | journal = Menopause: the Journal of the North American Menopause Society | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | doi =  10.1097/01.GME.0000094356.92081.EF | pages = 356–67 | pmid = 15167316 }}</ref> though there is no evidence to support these claims. Compounded BHRT has been marketed on the internet by pharmacies which make unfounded claims for its safety and its effectiveness for a variety of conditions.<ref name = FDAFAQ/>

The lack of distinction between FDA-approved bioidentical hormones and compounded bioidentical hormones as part of a package that includes saliva testing and compounding has resulted in considerable confusion regarding exactly what BHRT is.<ref name = Schwartz/>

There are a variety of FDA-approved products made using bioidentical estrogens and micronized progesterone, used to treat the symptoms of menopause:<ref name = Harvard/>

The term "synthetic" is also used incorrectly by lay "experts" in two different ways - to refer to the process used to manufacture all estrogens, including bioidentical estrogens, and to compounds that interact with estrogen receptors similar to estrogen molecules but are not found in nature.  Examples of the latter two include [[diethylstilbestrol]] and [[ethinylestradiol]].<ref name = Taylor2005/>

==Uses==
{{Main|Menopause|Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)}}
BHRT is used to reduce the symptoms of menopause. It is also promoted by some practitioners for anti-aging purposes and as providing benefits beyond menopausal symptom relief—improving the quality of life, though there is [[#Lack of evidence for claims|little evidence to support these claims]].<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Schwartz/><ref name = Boothby2008/>

==Components and compounding==
Typically, compounded preparations of bioidentical hormones include [[estriol]], [[estrone]], [[estradiol]], [[testosterone]], [[progesterone]] and sometimes [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), either individually or in some combination.<ref name = Cirigliano/> They are promoted as natural, safer and (in some cases) more efficacious than CHT; however, there are no scientific studies to support claims of superiority of BHs over CHRT.<ref name = Cirigliano/>   Estimates from sales of bulk hormones for compounding suggest that more than one million women may be using compounded BHRT in the U.S.<ref name = Kalvaitis/>  Bioidentical hormones are expected to have the same risks as conventional hormones made with the same products.<ref name = Medlett/>

===Estrogens===
In premenopausal women the majority of estrogen produced by the body is estradiol (produced primarily in the ovaries), while in postmenopausal women estrone (produced in fat cells) is the type of estrogen present in the greatest amount; however, the body is able to convert one type of estrogen into another to a certain extent. Because of the limited research into potency, delivery methods and conversion of the various estrogens, a valid scientific understanding of compounded estrogen products has not been achieved.<ref name = Chervenak/>  Synthetic estradiol, taken orally, splits when absorbed in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] and delivers bioidentical estradiol to the bloodstream.<ref name = Panay2010>{{cite journal |author=Panay N, Fenton A |title=Bioidentical hormones: what is all the hype about? |journal=Climacteric |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20067429 |doi=10.3109/13697130903550250 |url=}}</ref>

The hormone [[estriol]], produced during [[pregnancy]], is frequently compounded into bioidentical preparations in the United States.  While some think it to be a weaker estrogen, with a more limited period of effectiveness than estradiol, it has been demonstrated to be a stronger estrogen in certain ways.<ref name = Chervenak/>  Though initial research in the 1970s suggested possible use, follow-up studies have failed to confirm this potential.<ref name = Fugh2007/><ref name=NAMSMono/><ref name = Sites>{{cite journal |author=Sites CK |title=Bioidentical hormones for menopausal therapy |journal=Womens Health (Lond Engl) |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=163–71 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=19072518 |doi=10.2217/17455057.4.2.163 |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/571299}} (free subscription required)</ref>  Estriol is not found in any FDA-approved drug, and its safety and effectiveness as a hormone supplement is unknown.<ref name = Medlett/>

Estriol was part of the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] before FDA approval was needed for its use. Its approval was grandfathered by the FDA until 2008 when the agency banned its use, stating that manufacturers of estriol would have to create a new application and estriol would be treated as a new drug.<ref name = FDAmyth/>  Its use is not approved by [[Health Canada]]; estriol is not available as a pharmaceutical preparation in Canada or the United States, but is a commonly-prescribed conventional treatment in other countries and is available as a cream or vaginal suppository in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[European Union]].<ref name = Fugh2007/><ref name = Derzko/>  Estradiol is available as brand-name products in both oral and transdermal forms.<ref name = Derzko>{{cite journal | last = Derzko | first = C | year = 2009 | url = http://www.sigmamenopause.com/pdf/Derzko_BHT-Oct09.pdf | format = pdf | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 1–6 | title = Bioidentical Hormone Therapy at Menopause | journal = Endocrinology Rounds }}</ref>

===Progesterone===
Progesterone is used both orally and transdermally. Oral progesterone is micronized (ground) to increase availability, and is approved by the FDA to treat endometrial hyperplasia when used in opposition to estrogen. It has also been approved to relieve menopausal symptoms, either alone or in combination with estrogen. It is more reliable in treating menopausal sleep disorders than synthetic progestins. Transdermal progesterone is often used as a component of compounded BHRT but has not been clinically proven to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, as oral progesterone has.<ref name= Sites/>  The [[Editor in chief|editors-in-chief]] of the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Climacteric (journal)|Climacteric]]'' state that the greatest difference in function between bioidentical and synthetic hormones may be found in progesterone's behavior compared with [[progestin]].  Laboratory studies have suggested that bioidentical progesterone binds primarily to progesterone [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], while synthetic [[progestin]]s activate other receptors with a variety of effects.  The editors suggested that progesterone may have neutral-to-positive effects on the cardiovascular system, and induce [[apoptosis]] in breast epithelial cells.  They also called for more research to examine and confirm the effects of progesterone on health, and for continued use of regulated (rather than unregulated) individually compounded products provided by pharmacies. These compounds have not been directly compared with each other in  appropriate scientific tests, though as of 2010 trials had begun.<ref name = Panay2010/>  Progesterone is approved for use by both the FDA and Health Canada as a brand-name oral preparation.<ref name = Derzko/>  The [[France|French]] [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] study ''Etude Epidemiologique aupres de femmes de l’Education Nationale'' suggested micronized progesterone may offer a reduced risk of breast cancer compared to other progestins, though large-scale clinical trials have not yet been conducted.<ref name = Sood>{{cite pmid | 21383221}}</ref>  A 2012 practice advisory published by the journal ''[[Canadian Family Physician]]'' concluded "...there is no convincing evidence that bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than synthetic HRT."<ref>{{cite pmid | 22859638}}</ref>

===Other hormones===
Testosterone supplementation can improve libido in postmenopausal women, but can also reduce levels of [[high-density lipoprotein]] (good cholesterol).<ref name = Boothby2008/>  Commercial sources for testosterone for women in the U.S. are limited, and include the commercially prepared estrogen-testosterone mixture [[Estratest]]; compounding pharmacies are the main source of testosterone-only preparations for women.<ref name=NAMSMono>{{cite web | url = http://www.menopause.org/edumaterials/PG06monograph.pdf | format = pdf | title = Understanding the Controversy: Hormone Testing and Bioidentical Hormones | publisher = North American Menopause Society | date = 2006-10-11 | accessdate = 2010-01-18 }}</ref> There is little published data to indicate dosing, duration and method of administration, although there is increasing popular awareness of testosterone's use for increasing postmenopausal libido.<ref name = Schwartz/>  A testosterone patch has been approved for use in the United Kingdom and European Union, but in Canada and the United States it awaits long-term safety data.<ref name = Derzko/>

DHEA is an androgen [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] that lacks FDA and Health Canada approval for use in women, and is not available in Canada as a pharmaceutical preparation;<ref name = Derzko/> it is sold as an [[over-the-counter drug]] or incorporated into compounded preparations in the United States.  In the body, it can be converted to testosterone and then to estrogen; there are no consistent scientific findings or safety information supporting its use. High levels of DHEA have been linked to breast cancer.<ref name= Sites/>

===Compounding===
[[Compounding]] pharmacies use commercially available bulk drugs to create new formulations which differ (in form or dosage) from those manufactured on a large scale by pharmaceutical companies.<ref name = Fugh2007/> Custom-compounded BHRT is almost wholly restricted to the United States, where pharmacy compounding is governed at the state level while the FDA has regulatory authority over the compounded product. Some internet-based compounding pharmacies understate harm and claim benefits of compounded BHRT beyond what can be proven by evidence-based medicine, and many of their claims exceed those made by other, more mainstream, BHT practitioners.<ref name = Cirigliano/>

==Adverse effects==
The benefits—as well as adverse effects—are expected to be the same for bioidentical and synthetic hormones.<ref name=etetusp>{{cite web | url =http://www.wcrx.com/pdfs/pi/pi_estrace_wc_imprint.pdf | title =ESTRACE TABLETS, (estradiol tablets, USP) | author =Barr Laboratories, Inc. | authorlink=Barr Laboratories | month =March | year =2008 | publisher =wcrx.com | format =PDF | accessdate = 2010-01-27}}</ref> Dosages used in BHRT can be as high as ten times the oral dose provided by comparable HRT regimens; the hormones used are known to adversely impact biological markers of cardiovascular disease, and may produce a substantially higher risk of heart attack or stroke because of this.<ref>{{cite pmid | 17107222 }}</ref>  There are potentially serious adverse effects and important safety information which is required to be given with FDA approved HRT in the form of package inserts; however, package inserts are typically not given (or required) with compounded bioidentical preparations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Testimony/ucm154031.htm | title = Pharmacy Compounding/Compounding of Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapies | accessdate = 2010-03-16 | date = 2007-04-19 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]}}</ref><ref name="2008_compendium_of_selected_publications">{{Cite book | title = 2008 Compendium of Selected Publications (v. 1 2) | date = 15 Feb 2008 | publisher = American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecol | url = http://books.google.com/?id=FmhqAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 1-932328-44-0 | page = 299 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://ftp.resource.org/gpo.gov/hearings/110s/37150.wais.pdf | title = Bioidentical Hormones: Sound Science or Bad Medicine | format = pdf | date = 2007-04-19 | accessdate = 2010-03-16 | publisher = [[United States Senate]]}}</ref> This has led consumers into the erroneous assumption that bioidenticals are safer than FDA-approved hormones or lack any adverse effects—one of the concerns expressed about the hormones.<ref>{{cite web | last = Simon | first = JA | url = http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/705130 | title = Bioidentical Hormone Therapy: What Is It, Might It Have Advantages, and What We Simply Don't Know!

===Estrogens===
Less common (but serious) side effects of all post-menopausal estrogens include increased risk or severity of [[breast cancer|breast]], [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian]] or [[uterine cancer]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], [[blood clots]], [[dementia]], [[gallbladder disease]], [[high blood pressure]], [[liver]] problems, [[high blood sugar]], [[Water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], enlargement of benign tumors ([[fibroids]]) of the uterus, a spotty darkening of the skin, especially on the face ([[melasma]]), and vaginal [[yeast infection]].<ref name=etetusp/>

====Estradiol====
{{See also|Estradiol#Adverse effects}}
[[Estradiol]] (a type of estrogen) is&mdash;in the case of naturally menopausal women&mdash;only recommended for use for the shortest period of time and at the lowest effective dose due to its adverse-effects profile.<ref name=etetusp/> There is the potential for a range of adverse effects in [[breast]]s, skin, eyes, [[circulatory system|cardiovascular]], [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]], [[genitourinary system|genitourinary]] or [[central nervous system]]s. These risks, however, are very low.<ref name=etetusp/>

===Progesterone===

==Administration==
Hormones can be administered in a variety of ways, including percutaneous skin and vaginal creams, oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Though all preparations of a given type of estrogen (e.g. estradiol) may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the [[liver]] before entering the [[blood]]stream and in this process, most is converted to estrone. However, estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver and entering through the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and gels applied to the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin.<ref name = Harvard/> Pharmaceutical compounding is frequently used to modify the dose, form, and additives of the preparations, based on instructions from a health-care practitioner.

==Criticisms==

The primary difference between the popular promotions of CHRT and compounded BHRT involves BHRT advocates' use of regular testing of blood or saliva-bound hormone levels, use of individualized compounding rather than standard doses, dosing to attain certain levels in the body rather than for symptom relief, and the use of hormones for purposes other than relief of menopausal symptoms. Proponents of compounded BHRT have been criticized by many mainstream medical sources for making unsubstantiated claims about its effectiveness for a variety of purposes, and for promoting it as more safe and "natural" than CHRT.

Advocates for BHRT have claimed that commonly-compounded BHRT preparations are not commercially available; this is false, as there are many FDA-approved hormone preparations containing bioidentical molecules available both as proprietary or generic brands. The exception is estriol, used in the compounded bioidentical preparations Triest and Biest—in 2008, the FDA banned estriol until a [[New Drug Application]] had been completed; these preparations are not approved by either the FDA, or [[Health Canada]].<ref name = Medlett>{{cite pmid | 20508582 }}</ref>  Some advocates of compounding have also falsely claimed that customized compounding provides customized results; this is incorrect since it is aimed at producing a single hormone profile with absolute blood or saliva levels—which has not been demonstrated to be better than CHRT—and does not consider the rate at which individuals will differ in the activity, metabolism and excretion of the hormones. There have been no [[clinical trial]]s directly comparing the effectiveness or efficacy of bioidentical versus nonbioidentical compounds.<ref name = Cirigliano/>

A 2010 article published in ''[[The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics]]'' concluded "There is no acceptable evidence that 'bioidentical' hormones are safe or effective.  Patients should be discouraged from taking them."<ref name = Medlett/>

===Salivary testing and compounding===
BHRT is frequently associated with testing of saliva to establish a baseline hormone level and [[compounding]] of the substances by pharmacists (according to a doctor's advice) to produce preparations (and blood levels) of hormones that are individualized to the patients. There is no research demonstrating any benefit to either of these practices.<ref name = Fugh2007/><ref name="McBane2008"/><ref name = Boothby2008/><ref name = Medlett/><ref name = Mayo/> Though promoters of BHRT claim that saliva testing can be used to "customize" the level of hormones for individuals, and tests are used to determine which hormones are supposed to be deficient and require supplementation, there is no scientific basis to support the use of saliva testing. Estrogens are secreted in pulses within and over days, resulting in varying saliva levels.<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Boothby2004/><ref name = Medlett/>  Certain compounding formulations also attempt to use a single profile for all women, with no evidence that a specific profile is beneficial in all cases and no recognition that women differ in their sensitivity to hormones and metabolic rate.  Testing-based customizing also does not account for much of the effects, and synthesis of hormones occurs within [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] rather than in the blood; therefore, blood or saliva levels of hormones may not necessarily reflect actual biological activity.<ref name = Cirigliano/>  Other concerns include lack of evidence that samples are stable during storage and transportation, poor replication of results and considerable variation among [[assay]]s.<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Boothby2004/>  There are also no studies that link symptoms with blood or saliva levels of hormones.<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Fugh2007/>  The FDA recommends, instead, adjusting hormone therapy to the symptoms of the patient,<ref name = FDAFAQ/><ref name = Chervenak/><ref name = ACOG/> and there is no reason to adjust the dosing or monitor patients receiving BHRT.<ref name = Pastner>{{cite journal | last = Pastner | first = B | pmid = 18561473 | title = Pharmacy Compounding of Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT): A Proposed New Approach to Justify FDA Regulation of These Prescription Drugs | journal = Food & Drug L.J. | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 459–91 | year = 2008 }}</ref>  Skeptics of BHRT have also pointed out that there is no certainty regarding hormone levels in the body.<ref name = Harvard/>  The [[North American Menopause Society]] has supported warnings about the potential harm BHRT could cause, as it unnecessarily compounds drugs that are already FDA-approved in ways that lack an evidence base of safety or harm;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.menopause.org/bioidentical.aspx | title = Bioidentical Hormone Therapy  | publisher = [[North American Menopause Society]] | date = 2009-10-11 | accessdate = 2010-01-18}}</ref> this warning is supported by the [[Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher =  [[Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada]] | url = http://www.menopauseandu.ca/therapies/bioidentical-hormone-therapy_e.aspx | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy | accessdate = 2010-01-18 }}</ref>

Although promoted as a way of customizing treatment, hormone therapy does not require customization;<ref name = ACOG/> the use of testing to determine the amount of hormones administered could result in the dose being higher than the minimum recommended level to alleviate symptoms,<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Fugh2007/> or the administration of unnecessary hormones to asymptomatic women may result in greater risks to the patient.<ref name = Fugh2007/><ref name = Chervenak/>  In addition, analysis of the material used to promote BHRT suggests that rather than basing hormone doses on saliva results, practitioners are actually adjusting the dose based on symptoms.<ref name = Boothby2004/>  Health practitioners customize the care of their patients on an ongoing basis by choosing the medication, dose and administration route individually, using approved medications that have a demonstrated safety record and are not subject to the errors and inconsistencies of custom-prepared combinations.  Different bioidentical preparations result in mixtures with different strengths, and practitioners using compounded formulations may be unaware of the total dose of hormones their patients receive.<ref name = Chervenak/>  In a 2001 test of compounded bioidentical hormone products, the FDA found that 10 out of 29 products failed their quality tests; nine out of ten failed potency tests (comparable rates for drug manufacturers were less than 2% and 0.13%, respectively)<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Derzko/> A 2006 test found potency levels ranging from 67.5% to 268.4% of the potency specified on the label; some samples were mixtures of different hormones with some being above, and others below, the specified potency.<ref name = Medlett/>  The failure of potency testing could be problematic and dangerous for progesterone products, where specific levels of progesterone are required to protect the endometrium against precancerous hyperplasia.<ref name = Derzko/>

Boothby, Doering and Kipersztok summarize the issue as being a poor effort to apply principles of [[pharmacokinetics]] to achieve individualized dosing for drugs that do not require it.<ref name = Boothby2004/>

Saliva testing has not been shown to accurately measure blood-bound hormone levels. The FDA recommends the lowest dose of hormones that effectively relieve symptoms and does not recommend custom compounding, blood or saliva testing.<ref name = FDAFAQ/><ref name = Holtorf2009>{{cite journal |author=Holtorf K |title=The bioidentical hormone debate: are bioidentical hormones (estradiol, estriol, and progesterone) safer or more efficacious than commonly used synthetic versions in hormone replacement therapy? |journal=Postgrad Med |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=73–85 |year=2009 |month=January | pmid = 19179815 |doi=10.3810/pgm.2009.01.1949 | url=http://www.bobmehrpharmacies.com/images/_content/bio-identical/The%20Bioidentical%20Hormone%20Debate-%20Ken%20Holtorf%20MD.pdf | format = pdf}}</ref>

In 2006, actress [[Suzanne Somers]] released the book ''Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones'' endorsing the use of bioidentical hormones. The book was criticized by a group of doctors who (though generally supportive of BHRT) state that more research is required, and object to protocols mentioned in the book—because of their potential danger and the promoters' lack of qualifications.<ref name = Ellin>{{cite news | last = Ellin | first = A | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/fashion/15suzanne.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2006-10-15 | accessdate = 2009-10-27 | title = A Battle Over 'Juice of Youth' }}</ref> Somers' book may have raised the profile of BHRT for the growing number of menopausal women, but also may have caused confusion by making unsubstantiated claims for BHRT and referring to bioidentical hormones as non-drug products with fewer risks.<ref name = Cirigliano/>  Bioidentical hormones have also been discussed on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', with Somers as a guest.<ref name = Oprah>{{cite web | url = http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow/20090128_tows_suzannesomers/ | title = The Bioidentical Debate | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | publisher = [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] }}</ref>

Bioidentical-hormone proponents [[Erika Schwartz]] and [[Kent Holtorf]] criticized a 2008 literature review on bioidentical hormones for addressing only compounded bioidentical hormones and not reviewing FDA-approved bioidentical products, which they believed added to the existing confusion.<ref name = Schwartz/><ref name = Holtorf2009/>  Michael Cirigliano and Judi Chervenak have stated in reviews of literature on BHRT that large-scale, peer-reviewed studies should be used to establish the safety, efficacy and beliefs about the use of bioidentical hormones.<ref name = Cirigliano/><ref name = Chervenak/>  Two 2008 studies conducted in France found that estradiol plus micronized progesterone did not increase the incidence of breast cancer, while a comparison of estradiol plus different types of progestins found a reduced risk of invasive breast cancer with micronized progesterone. Christine Derzko stated that the evidence supported the use of bioidentical estrogen plus progesterone, but since the trial was an observational cohort study rather than a [[randomized controlled trial]] that compared different types of hormones head-to-head, more data was required before concluding bioidentical hormones were safer and preferred.  Derzko concluded that there was weak (but promising) preliminary evidence that bioidentical hormones may present equal (or possibly lower) risks than conventional HRT; however, there was no data supporting the use of compounding. Derzko recommended following evidence-based medicine and cited concerns over BHRT by numerous medical organizations—requirements for oversight over compounding, [[black box warning]]s for all bioidentical products, and the establishment of a mandatory adverse-events registry.<ref name = Derzko/>

M. Sarah Rosenthal, Director of the [[University of Kentucky]] Program for Bioethics and Patients’ Rights, has stated that she believes BHRT is an experimental therapy that is often prescribed by practitioners who sell the products, and are thus in an unethical position of [[conflict of interest]].  Rosenthal has also described problematic issues with BHRT including patients receiving information from popular books while lacking the scientific literacy to separate rhetoric from evidence about hormone replacement, illegitimate claims of a "big pharam" conspiracy to suppress bioidentical prescribing, the extra and unnecessary cost of the products that are often not covered by insurance plans, and the inaccurate depiction of bioidentical prescribing as "cutting edge science" rather than unproven alternative medicine.<ref name = Rosenthalethical/>

==="Natural" claims===
Bioidentical hormones are frequently marketed as being "natural", or more natural than conventional HRT.  The term "natural" can be used to suggest or emphasize a variety of different ideas—similarity with endogenous hormones, extraction from a plant-based source, and that the hormones are not manufactured or synthesized.<ref name = Burrell>{{cite journal |author=Burrell BA |title=The replacement of the replacement in menopause: hormone therapy, controversies, truth and risk |journal=Nurs Inq |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=212–22 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19689648 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1800.2009.00456.x |url=}}</ref>

* [[Endogeny]] - this meaning of "natural" implies that the hormones are molecularly identical to those found within the body.  However, BHRT (like all types of HRT used in naturally menopausal women) is unnatural in that it opposes the biologically determined declining levels of fertility hormones in aging women and medicalizes a stage of human life that is probably normal.<ref name = Burrell/>  In addition, most of the conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) extracted from pregnant horse urine (such as [[Premarin]]) are converted to human estrogens once they enter the body. However, not all are converted, and BHRT advocates allege that the small amount that is not converted may have some harmful effects. This is still being studied.<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacLennan AH, Sturdee DW |title=The 'bioidentical/bioequivalent' hormone scam |journal=Climacteric |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16428119 |doi=10.1080/13697130500487166 |url=}}</ref>

* Plant-derived - Women who purchase compounded BHRT are more likely to associate the term "natural" with the idea that the hormones are derived from plant sources.<ref name = Cirigliano>{{cite journal | last = Cirigliano | first = M | pmid = 17627398  | url = http://www.solaltech.com/doctors/3/Bioidentical%20Hormone%20Therapy--%20Cirigliano.pdf | format = pdf | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review of the evidence | journal = Journal of Womens Health | year = 2007 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 600–31 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2006.0311 }}</ref>  However, both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones are sourced from the same plants, generally [[soy bean]]s or [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s.<ref name = Harvard/>

* Manufacturing - both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones are synthesized using the same chemical precursors; [[diosgenin]] is extracted from soy or yam plants, converted into [[progesterone]] and used as a hormone [[precursor (chemistry)|chemical precursor]] to create the final product.<ref name = Harvard/>  "Natural" is also used to promote the idea of being unmodified, and containing the "goodness" of a pure substance. However, this argument simultaneously draws upon a scientific discourse and methodology; even hormones called "bioidentical" have been heavily processed and converted in a pharmaceutical lab.<ref name = Burrell/>  Premarin (conjugated estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant horses) contains the only truly "natural" hormones—natural in the sense of being completely unmodified beyond blending the estrogens to achieve a specific ratio.<ref name = Taylor2005/>

The monthly newsletter ''Harvard Women's Health Watch'', published by [[Harvard Medical School]], states that "natural" does not automatically mean "safe", and that "natural" can be used to indicate any product with an animal, plant, or mineral source—including hormones that are not bioidentical (such as [[Premarin]]), as well as the molecules extracted from soybean and yam sources used in many bioidentical and nonbioidentical commercial preparations.<ref name = Harvard/>

The alternative medicine [[consumer protection|watchdog]] site [[Quackwatch]] recommends against the use of bioidentical hormones due to lack of quality control over compounding, posing the same risks as conventional hormones, the use of unnecessary saliva testing, and for including the non-FDA-approved hormone [[estriol]].  [[Stephen Barrett]], the site's owner, concludes his review with the statement "The bottom line for consumers is very simple: Steer clear of anyone who prescribes "bioidentical" hormones or recommends saliva testing as the basis for evaluating hormone status."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmwatch.org/strategy/bioidentical.shtml | title = Steer Clear of "Bioidentical" Hormone Therapy | last = Barrett | first = S | accessdate = 2010-09-13 | date = 2008-01-19 | authorlink = Stephen Barrett | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] }}</ref>

==Regulatory status in the United States==
Compounded BHRT is used almost exclusively in the United States,<ref name = Cirigliano/> and many FDA-approved formulations that are wholly or partially made of bioidentical hormones are available.<ref name = Harvard/> Topical hormone preparations such as progesterone, estrogen and DHEA creams can be purchased in stores or over the internet and are not regulated by the FDA, as they are generally considered cosmetic.<ref name = Fugh2007/>

When prescribed by a licensed practitioner, the compounding of bioidentical hormones is controlled by the state pharmacy boards rather than the FDA,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ola/2007/hormone041907.html | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] | title = Statement of Steven K.

All three estradiol products passed every test; however, two out of five progesterone products failed at least one test of potency, content or uniformity.<ref name = Cirigliano/>

In October 2005 [[Wyeth]] Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of both FDA-approved bioidentical and nonbioidentical HRT preparations, filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA asking for enforcement action against compounding pharmacies which dispensed BHRT, and to investigate labeling and advertising guidelines. Soon after, the FDA took a number of enforcement actions against several (primarily Internet-based) pharmacies that were producing compounded BHRT and in 2008, banned the use of estriol in the US.<ref name = FDA/><ref name = Pastner/> The FDA stated that they did not take these regulatory actions against compounded bioidentical hormones in response to Wyeth's request, since that is not the purpose of a citizen petition. They said that they had an ongoing investigation when they received the petition.<ref name = FDAFAQ/> The FDA has acknowledged that they are unaware of any adverse events connected to the use of estriol, but ordered pharmacies to discontinue its use.<ref name = Holtorf2009/> The agency's Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance stated that use of estriol would  require a permit for research and a new drug application.  The FDA also stated that it has not approved any drug containing estriol and that no information had been submitted to the FDA regarding its safety and effectiveness.<ref name = FDAmyth>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049311.htm | title = Bio-Identicals: Sorting Myth from Fact | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | date = 2008-04-08 }}</ref>  The FDA's concerns over the marketing and use of bioidentical hormones were supported by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.<ref name = AACE>{{cite web | url = http://media.aace.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4681 | title = The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) strongly supports the FDA in its concerns regarding the marketing and use of so called Bio-identical Hormones | date = 2008-01-23 | accessdate = 2010-01-18 | publisher = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists}}</ref>  In response to the FDA's actions, the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists (IACP) enlisted thousands of women to join a letter-writing campaign to the FDA to reverse this action, citing Wyeth's attempt as a "self-serving, and at times duplicitous, campaign to restrict patients’ access to alternatives to its own products".<ref name = IACPstatement2008>{{cite web | url = http://www.iacprx.org/site/DocServer/SCONRES_88_Press_Release_061608.pdf?docID=4461 | format = pdf | title = Senators Join Thousands of Patients, Doctors, Pharmacists in Supporting Women’s Access to Critical Hormone Treatments | date = 2008-06-16 | accessdate = 2010-01-18 | publisher =International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists }}</ref>

In November 2006, the [[American Medical Association]] adopted a policy urging the Food and Drug Administration to survey compounded BHRT products for purity and dosage; to maintain a registry and require mandatory adverse event reporting by manufacturers and compounding pharmacies related to bioidentical hormones; to mandate the inclusion of uniform patient information, including warnings and precautions regarding bioidentical products; and to prohibit use of the term "bioidentical hormones" unless the agency has approved the preparation.<ref name = AMApolicy>{{cite web | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/19/wpccompendfinal.pdf | title = American Medical Association Women Physicians Congress: Policy Compendium | date = 2007-10-01 | accessdate = 2010-01-06 | publisher = [[American Medical Association]] }}</ref>

On July 18, 2008, a US Appeals Court issued a ruling stating that new drug approval processes should not be applied to compounded drugs that complied with established guidelines, and also that provisions of the regulations relevant to the use of estriol were still in effect, preventing the FDA from taking action against pharmacies using estriol in compounded products.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmacist.com/AM/PrinterTemplate.cfm?Section=Pharmacy_News&template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=16948 | title = Court rules compounded products are neither uniformly exempt from nor subject to new drug approval requirements | accessdate = 2010-01-21 | date = 2008-07-31 | publisher = [[American Pharmacists Association]] }}</ref>

==Wiley Protocol==
{{Main|Wiley Protocol}}
The Wiley Protocol is a version of compounded BHRT, endorsed by [[T. S. Wiley]], whose goal is to produce serum levels of estradiol and progesterone that are identical to those of a young woman with a normal menstrual cycle.  The Wiley Protocol has been criticized for a variety of reasons.<ref name = Rosenthal2008>{{cite journal | last = Rosenthal | first = MS | year = 2008 | title = The Wiley Protocol: an analysis of ethical issues | journal = Menopause | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 1014–22 | pmid = 18551081 | doi = 10.1097/gme.0b013e318178862e}}</ref><ref name = Ellin/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/print?id=2874767 | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Suzanne Somers: Super Saleswoman: Has Somers Found the Fountain of Youth? | author = Sherr L; Ruppel G | date = 2007-02-16 | accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/44568|title=A Real Somers Storm: At war over Suzanne Somers's book on 'bioidenticals'| work = [[Newsweek]] | date = 2006-11-13 | author = Kantrowitz B; Wingert P | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref>
