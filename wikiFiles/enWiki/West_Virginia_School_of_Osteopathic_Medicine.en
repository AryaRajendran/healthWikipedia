== History ==
Purchasing a facility once used as [[Greenbrier Military School]] (1812–1972), the Greenbrier College of Osteopathic Medicine began as a private school with a class of 36 students in 1974. Two years later, in 1976, the [[West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission]] brought the school under its umbrella, establishing it as a state-funded public institution now named the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine. In 1978, WVSOM graduated its first class of 33 students.<ref name="WVSOM at a Glance" /> 
Extensive renovations started in 1992 and continue into the present time, with construction just completed on a new {{convert|19000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building that includes exam rooms and laboratory space. 
WVSOM has spent more than $38 million on construction and renovation projects while increasing from one building in 1974 to 12 campus facilities across its more than {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus, all of this was accomplished while maintaining a debt free financial status.<ref>{{cite web

== Curriculum ==

WVSOM was founded on the principles of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]], a branch of medicine founded by frontiersman [[Andrew Taylor Still]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. The basic premise of osteopathic medicine is that a physician’s primary role is to facilitate the body’s inherent ability to heal itself. While originally designed as an improvement on the traditional medicine of 19th century America, osteopathic medicine became a reformation within the U.S. healthcare system while remaining distinct from other forms of medicine.<ref name="About Osteopathic Medicine">[http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/default.aspx About Osteopathic Medicine]</ref> 
In addition to a medical education, students at WVSOM also learn holistic techniques and are trained in [[Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine]] (OMM), manual-based therapies used to relieve pain, restore range of motion and foster the body’s own ability to heal itself.<ref name="About Osteopathic Medicine" />
Medical school at WVSOM is a four-year program, with two years of training located at the Lewisburg-based campus and the final two years taking place off-campus during clinical rotations.<ref name="WVSOM at a Glance" />
WVSOM offers two curricular choices based on a person’s individual learning style: Systems Based Learning (SBL)—a conventional curricular track, incorporating lectures, labs and clinical experiences<ref>[http://www.wvsom.edu/applicants/sbl.cfm Systems Based Learning (SBL) Track]</ref>—and Problem Based Learning (PBL)—a program that relies on small group and student-directed learning that identifies clinical problems, using a hands-on approach to learning osteopathic skills.<ref>[http://www.wvsom.edu/applicants/pbl.cfm Problem Based Learning (PBL) Track]</ref>
WVSOM uses human subject robots as part of its training. The lifelike robots breath, cry, defecate, bleed and are anatomically correct, allowing students to practice nearly every aspect of patient care, including checking vital signs, inserting a chest tube and performing CPR.

== Principles of Osteopathic Medicine ==
