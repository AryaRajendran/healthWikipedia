'''McLeod syndrome''' (or ''McLeod phenomenon'') is a [[genetic disorder]] that may affect the [[blood]], [[brain]], [[peripheral nerves]], [[muscle]] and [[heart]]. It is caused by a variety of recessively-inherited mutations in the [[XK (protein)|XK gene]] on the [[X chromosome]]. The gene is responsible for producing the Kx protein, a secondary supportive protein for the [[Kell antigen]] on the [[red blood cell]] surface.

==Clinical features==
Patients usually begin to notice symptoms in their 50s and the course is usually slowly progressive. Common features include [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[cardiomyopathy]] and [[hemolytic anemia]]. Other features include limb [[chorea (disease)|chorea]], facial [[tics]], other oral movements (lip and tongue biting), [[seizures]], a late-onset [[dementia]] and behavioral changes.

==Laboratory features==
McLeod syndrome is one of only a few disorders in which [[acanthocyte]]s may be found on the [[Blood film|peripheral blood smear]]. Blood evaluation may show signs of [[hemolytic anemia]]. Elevated [[creatine kinase]] can be seen with [[myopathy]] in McLeod syndrome.

==Radiologic and pathologic features==
[[MRI]] shows increased T2 signal in the lateral [[putamen]] with [[caudate nucleus|caudate]] atrophy and secondary [[Lateral ventricles|lateral ventricular]] dilation. [[Necropsy]] shows loss of neurons and [[gliosis]] in the caudate and [[globus pallidus]]. Similar changes may also be seen in the [[thalamus]], [[substantia nigra]] and putamen. The [[cerebellum]] and [[cerebral cortex]] are generally spared.

==History==
McLeod syndrome was discovered in 1961 and, as with the [[Kell antigen system]], was named after the first patient in which it was found: a [[Harvard]] dental student Hugh McLeod, whose [[red blood cell]]s were observed to have weak expression of Kell system antigens during [[blood donation]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allen FH, Krabbe SM, Corcoran PA |title=A new phenotype (McLeod) in the Kell blood-group system |journal=Vox Sang. |volume=6 |issue= |pages=555–60 |year=1961 |month=September |pmid=13860532 }}</ref> and his red cells were found to be [[acanthocyte|acanthocytic]] (spiky) under the microscope.

==Genetics==
The McLeod phenotype is a [[Recessive gene|recessive]] [[mutation]] of the [[Kell antigen system|Kell blood group system]]. The McLeod [[gene]] encodes the [[XK (protein)|XK protein]], which is located on the [[X chromosome]],<ref name="pmid19040496">{{cite journal |author=Arnaud L, Salachas F, Lucien N, ''et al.'' |title=Identification and characterization of a novel XK splice site mutation in a patient with McLeod syndrome |journal=Transfusion |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=479–84 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19040496 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.02003.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0041-1132&date=2009&volume=49&issue=3&spage=479}}</ref> and has the structural characteristics of a [[membrane transport]] [[protein]] but an unknown function. Absence of the XK protein is an [[Sex linkage|X-linked disease]].

Mutational variants result in McLeod syndrome either with or without [[neuroacanthocytosis]]: the gene on the X chromosome for McLeod syndrome is physically close to the gene for [[chronic granulomatous disease]]. As a result, individuals with one relatively small deletion may have both diseases.

The phenotype may be present without the syndrome presenting.<ref name="pmid17302777">{{cite journal |author=Walker RH, Danek A, Uttner I, Offner R, Reid M, Lee S |title=McLeod phenotype without the McLeod syndrome |journal=Transfusion |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=299–305 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17302777 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01106.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0041-1132&date=2007&volume=47&issue=2&spage=299}}</ref>

==Epidemiology and disease associations==
McLeod syndrome is present in 0.5 to 1 per 100,000 the population. McLeod males have variable [[acanthocyte|acanthocytosis]] due to a defect in the inner leaflet bilayer of the [[red blood cell]], as well as mild [[hemolysis]]. McLeod females have only occasional acanthocytes and very mild [[hemolysis]]; the lesser severity is thought to be due to [[X chromosome]] inactivation via the [[Lyon effect]]. Some individuals with McLeod phenotype develop [[myopathy]], [[neuropathy]] or psychiatric symptoms, producing a syndrome that may mimic [[chorea (disease)|chorea]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Danek A, Rubio JP, Rampoldi L, ''et al.'' |title=McLeod neuroacanthocytosis: genotype and phenotype |journal=Ann.

Neurol. Sci. |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=89–94 |year=1994 |month=June |pmid=7931427 }}</ref>

McLeod syndrome can cause an increase in the enzymes [[creatine kinase]] (CK) and [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) found in routine blood screening.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for McLeod syndrome, the treatment is supportive depending on symptoms. Medication may assist management of epilepsy, cardiac and psychiatric features, although patients may respond poorly to treatment for chorea.
