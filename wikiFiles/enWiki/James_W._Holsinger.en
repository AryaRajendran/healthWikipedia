Given the Democratic resistance coupled with Holsinger's lack of response to the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator [[Jim Bunning]], a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] denied. The political scientist [[Norman Ornstein]] said, "It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's a big fat 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate. Even if you know or believe you are not likely to be confirmed, the idea that you wouldn't sort of do what the committee has asked is still kind of mind-boggling." The committee's Republican [[ranking member]] said Holsinger's lack of response was "not helpful" while the [[editorial board]] of Kentucky's [[Courier-Journal]] characterized it as "disrespectful" and "baffling".<ref name="HL061808">{{cite web

The nomination was never voted on by the Senate and afterwards, in January 2009, Bush appointed him to fill a vacant unpaid position on the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] to expire May 2010.<ref name="010709AP"/><ref name="LH010709"/>

===Nomination controversy===
Following the nomination, Holsinger's views on homosexuality came under scrutiny, and several Democratic senators expressed concern or opposition to the nomination. In addition, individuals released statements supporting or opposing the nomination. Kevin Naff, editor of the [[LGBT]] newspaper, the ''[[Washington Blade]]'', charged that Holsinger has a "long record of anti-gay bias."<ref>{{cite web

The critics were largely concerned with a 1991 [[white paper]]  he wrote titled ''[http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/Holsinger_on_Homosexuality.pdf Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality]'' for a committee in the United Methodist Church reviewing its position that homosexuality violates Christian teaching.<ref name="Banerjee June9"/> According to [[Jake Tapper]] of [[ABC News]], the paper "purported" to discuss homosexuality from a medical standpoint.<ref name="Banerjee June9"/><ref name="ABCNEWS">{{cite web

Supporters of Holsinger's nomination defended the paper as a review of the relevant medical literature at that time.<ref name="Banerjee June9"/> Critics said the paper reflected a pre-1970s view of human sexuality, and that it had a political agenda and was not a scientific paper.<ref name="ABCNEWS"/> At his confirmation hearing, Holsinger said the paper did not represent his current views and was not “an example of my scientific work.”<ref name="NYT071307"/>

Critics have also expressed concerns about Holsinger's leadership of The United Methodist Church’s Judicial Council, the highest court of the Church. In 2005, the court defrocked [[Irene Elizabeth Stroud]], an openly lesbian minister, and in a separate case reinstated a pastor who had been suspended for refusing to allow a gay man to join his congregation.<ref name = "Banerjee June9"/><ref name="criticism surprises"/><ref name="NYT110105">{{cite web

===Public health stances===
