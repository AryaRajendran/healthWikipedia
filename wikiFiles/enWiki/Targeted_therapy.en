'''Targeted therapy''' or '''Molecularly targeted therapy''' is a type of [[medication]] that blocks the growth of [[cancer cell]]s by interfering with specific targeted [[molecules]] needed for [[carcinogenesis]] and  [[tumor]] growth,<ref name=NCI-TT-def>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=270742 |title=Definition of targeted therapy - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms }}</ref> rather than by simply interfering with all [[rapidly dividing cells]] (e.g. with traditional [[chemotherapy]]). [[Radiotherapy]] is not considered a 'targeted therapy' despite it being often aimed at the tumours. 

Targeted cancer therapies are expected to be more effective than current treatments and less harmful to normal cells. 

There are targeted therapies for [[breast cancer]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[lymphoma]], [[prostate cancer]], [[melanoma]] and other cancers.<ref name=NCI-TT-tutorials>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/targetedtherapies NCI: Targeted Therapy tutorials]</ref>

The definitive experiments that showed that targeted therapy would reverse the malignant phenotype of tumor cells involved treating Her2/neu transformed cells with monoclonal antibodies in vitro and in vivo by Mark Greene’s laboratory and reported from 1985.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.84.17.6317 |author=Perantoni AO, Rice JM, Reed CD, Watatani M, Wenk ML |title=Activated neu oncogene sequences in primary tumors of the peripheral nervous system induced in rats by transplacental exposure to ethylnitrosourea |journal=Proc.

==Types==
The main categories of targeted therapy are ''[[small molecule]]s'' and ''[[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]].''

===Small molecules===
[[Image:Mechanism imatinib.svg|thumb|300px|Mechanism of [[imatinib]]]]
Many are [[tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]]s.

*[[Imatinib|Imatinib mesylate]] (Gleevec, also known as STI–571) is approved for [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]] and some other types of cancer.  Early clinical trials indicate that imatinib may be effective in treatment of [[dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans]].
*[[Gefitinib]] (Iressa, also known as ZD1839), targets the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) [[tyrosine kinase]] and is approved in the [[U.S.]] for non small cell [[lung cancer]].
*[[Erlotinib]] (marketed as Tarceva).  Erlotinib inhibits [[epidermal growth factor receptor]],<ref name="pmid19159467">{{cite journal |author=Katzel JA, Fanucchi MP, Li Z |title=Recent advances of novel targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer |journal=J Hematol Oncol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19159467 |doi=10.1186/1756-8722-2-2 |url=http://www.jhoonline.org/content/2/1/2 |pmc=2637898}}</ref> and works through a similar mechanism as gefitinib.  Erlotinib has been shown to increase survival in metastatic non small cell [[lung cancer]] when used as second line therapy.  Because of this finding, erlotinib has replaced gefitinib in this setting.
*[[Bortezomib]] (Velcade) is an [[apoptosis]]-inducing [[proteasome inhibitor]] drug that causes cancer cells to undergo cell death by interfering with proteins. It is approved in the [[U.S.]] to treat [[multiple myeloma]] that has not responded to other treatments.
*The [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] [[tamoxifen]] has been described as the foundation of targeted therapy.<ref name="pmid18068350">{{cite journal |author=Jordan VC |title=Tamoxifen: catalyst for the change to targeted therapy |journal=Eur. J. Cancer |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=30–38 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18068350 |pmc=2566958 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2007.11.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-8049(07)00861-1}}</ref>
*[[Janus kinase inhibitor]]s, e.g. FDA approved [[tofacitinib]]
*[[ALK inhibitor]]s, e.g. [[crizotinib]]
*[[Bcl-2 inhibitor]]s (e.g. [[obatoclax]] in clinical trials, [[ABT-263]], and [[Gossypol]].<ref name="pmid19079626">{{cite journal |author=Warr MR, Shore GC |title=Small-molecule Bcl-2 antagonists as targeted therapy in oncology |journal=Curr Oncol |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=256–61 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19079626 |pmc=2601021 |doi= |url=http://www.current-oncology.com/index.php/oncology/article/view/392/306;}}</ref>
*[[PARP inhibitor]]s (e.g. Iniparib, Olaparib in clinical trials)
*[[PI3K inhibitor]]s (e.g. [[perifosine]] in a phase III trial)
*[[Apatinib]] is a selective [[VEGF receptors|VEGF Receptor]] 2 inhibitor which has shown encouraging anti-tumor activity in a broad range of malignancies in clinical trials.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/529 |title=Safety and pharmacokinetics of novel selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 inhibitor YN968D1 in patients with advanced malignancies |year=2010 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-10-529 |pmid=20923544 |pmc=2984425 |volume=10 |author=Li J, Zhao X, Chen L, ''et al.'' |journal=BMC Cancer |pages=529}}</ref> Apatinib is currently in clinical development for metastatic [[gastric carcinoma]], metastatic [[breast cancer]] and advanced [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=apatinib</ref>
*[[AN-152]], (AEZS-108) [[doxorubicin]] linked to [D-Lys(6)]- [[LHRH]], Phase II results for ovarian cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=74&abstractID=50099 |title=Phase II study of AEZS-108 (AN-152), a targeted cytotoxic LHRH analog, in patients with LHRH receptor-positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer. |year=2010 }}</ref>
*[[Braf inhibitor]]s ([[vemurafenib]], [[dabrafenib]], [[LGX818]]) used to treat metastatic [[melanoma]] that harbors BRAF V600E mutation
*[[MEK inhibitor]]s ([[trametinib]], [[MEK162]]) are used in experiments, often in combination with BRAF inhibitors to treat [[melanoma]]
*[[CDK inhibitor]]s, e.g. [[PD-0332991]], [[LEE011]] in clinical trials
*[[salinomycin]] has demonstrated potency in killing [[cancer stem cells]] in both laboratory-created and naturally occurring breast tumors in mice.

===Monoclonal antibodies===
{{main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}
Several are in development and a few have been licenced by the FDA. Examples of licenced monoclonal antibodies include:
*[[Rituximab]] (marketed as MabThera or Rituxan) targets [[CD20]] found on B cells.  It is used in non Hodgkin [[lymphoma]]
*[[Trastuzumab]] (Herceptin) targets the [[Her2/neu]] (also known as ErbB2) receptor expressed in some types of [[breast cancer]]
*[[Cetuximab]] (marketed as Erbitux) targets the epidermal growth factor receptor.  It is used in the treatment of [[colon cancer]] and [[non-small cell lung cancer]].
*[[Bevacizumab]] (marketed as Avastin) targets circulating VEGF ligand.  It is approved for use in the treatment of [[colon cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], and is investigational in the treatment of [[sarcoma]]. Its use for the treatment of [[brain tumor]]s has been recommended.<ref>{{cite news

Many [[Antibody-drug conjugate]]s (ADCs) are being developed. See also [[ADEPT (medicine)|ADEPT]] (Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy).

==Progress and future==

In the [[U.S.]], the  [[National Cancer Institute]]'s  ''[http://home.ncifcrf.gov/mtdp  Molecular Targets Development Program]'' (MTDP) aims to identify and evaluate molecular targets that may be candidates for drug development.
