'''''Xanthelasma''''' (or '''''xanthelasma palpebrarum''''') is a sharply demarcated yellowish deposit of fat underneath the skin, usually on or around the [[eyelids]].<ref name=lang>{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Gerhard K |title=Ophthalmology |publisher=Thieme |location=Stuttgart |year=2000}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> While they are neither harmful nor painful, these minor growths may be disfiguring and can be removed.<ref name=lang/> They are common in people of Asian origin and those from the Mediterranean region.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Because of the hereditary component, they may or may not indicate high blood levels of cholesterol. Where there is no family history of ''xanthelasmata'', they usually indicate high cholesterol and may correlate with a risk of [[atheroma]]tous disease.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

A ''xanthelasma'' may instead be referred to as a ''[[xanthoma]]'' when becoming larger and nodular, assuming tumorous proportions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Shields, Carol; Shields, Jerry |title=Eyelid, conjunctival, and orbital tumors: atlas and textbook |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7578-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> Still, ''xanthelasma'' is often classified simply as a subtype of ''xanthoma''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=xanthelasma |title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition=8th |year=2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/xanthelasma}}</ref>

==Treatment==
''Xanthelasmata'' can be removed with a [[trichloroacetic acid]] peel, surgery, [[laser]]s or [[cryotherapy]]. Removal can cause scarring and pigment changes, but it is unusual after treatment with trichloroacetic acid.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Name==
The word is derived from Greek ''xanthos, ξανθός'', "yellow" and ''έλασμα, elasma'', "foil". The plural is ''xanthelasmata''. ''Palpebrarum'' is Latin for 'of the [[eyebrow]]s' (plural [[genitive case]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
