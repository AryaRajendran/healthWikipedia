The '''canine space''' (also termed the '''infra-orbital space'''),<ref name="Hargreaves 2010">{{cite book|last=Hargreaves KM, Cohen S (editors), Berman LH (web editor)|title=Cohen's pathways of the pulp|year=2010|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-06489-7|pages=590–594|edition=10th}}</ref> is a [[fascial spaces of the head and neck|fascial space of the head and neck]] (sometimes also termed [[fascia]]l spaces or tissue spaces). It is a thin [[potential space]] on the face, and is paired on either side. It is located between the [[levator anguli oris muscle]] inferiorly and the [[levator labii superioris muscle]] superiorly.<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=317–333|edition=5th}}</ref><ref name="Hargreaves 2010" /> The term is derived from the fact that the space is in the region of the [[canine fossa]], and that infections originating from the [[Maxillary canine|maxillary canine tooth]] may spread to involve the space. ''Infra-orbital'' is derived from ''[[wikt:infra-|infra-]]'' meaning below and [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] which refers to the eye socket.

==Location and structure==
===Anatomic boundaries===

The boundaries of the canine space are:<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the nasal cartilages anteriorly
* the buccal space posteriorly
* the [[ Quadratus labii superioris muscles|quadratus labii superioris muscle]] (levator labii superioris) superiorly
* the [[oral mucosa]] of the maxiallry labial sulcus inferiorly
* the quadratus labii superioris muscle superficially
* and the deep border is created by the levator anguli oris muscle.

===Communications===
the canine space communicates with the buccal space posteriorly.<ref name="Hupp 2008" />

===Contents===
The contents of the canine space are:<ref name="Hupp 2008" />
* the [[angular artery]] and [[angular vein]]
* the [[infra-orbital nerve]] (a branch of the maxillary division of the [[trigeminal nerve]])

==Clinical relevance==
Canine space infections may occur by spread of infection from the buccal space.<ref name="Hupp 2008" />  Signs and symptoms of a canine space abscess might include swelling that obliterates the [[nasolabial fold]]. If left untreated, infections of this space will eventually spontaneously drain via the [[Canthus|medial or lateral canthus]] of the eye, as this is the path of least resistance.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> Treatment is usually by surgical [[incision and drainage]], and the incision is placed inside the mouth to avoid a facial scar.

Rarely, when infections of the canine space erode into the [[infra-orbital vein]] or the [[inferior ophthalmic vein]] (via the [[paranasal air sinuses|sinuses]]), there can be spread via the common ophthalmic vein through the [[superior orbital fissure]] and into the [[cavernous sinus]]. This can result in septic [[cavernous sinus thrombosis]], which is a rare, but life-threatening condition.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 

===Odontogenic infection===
[[Odontogenic infection]]s may spread to involve the canine space. The most likely causative tooth is the maxillary canine or maxillary first premolar.<ref name="Hargreaves 2010" /> This occurs when pus (e.g. from a [[periapical abscess]]), perforates the buccal cortical plate of the maxilla above the level of attachment of the levator anguli oris muscle. This is more likely if the tooth root is long (the maxillary canine has the longest root of all the teeth), and its apex lies at a level above the muscle attachment.<ref name="Hargreaves 2010" />
