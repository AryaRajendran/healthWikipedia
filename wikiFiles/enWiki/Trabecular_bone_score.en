The '''trabecular bone score''' is a measure of [[bone]] texture correlated with bone microarchitecture and a marker for the risk of [[osteoporosis]]. Introduced in 2008,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2007.11.018 |title=Correlations between grey-level variations in 2D projection images (TBS) and 3D microarchitecture: Applications in the study of human trabecular bone microarchitecture |year=2008 |last1=Pothuaud |first1=Laurent |last2=Carceller |first2=Pascal |last3=Hans |first3=Didier |journal=Bone |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=775–87 |pmid=18234577}}</ref> its main projected use is alongside measures of [[bone density]] in better predicting fracture risk in people with metabolic bone problems.

To diagnose [[osteoporosis]], despite the inclusion of [[bone mineral density]] (BMD), biological markers and clinical factors of fracture risk, many not detected patients are at risk and many fractures are not explained. [[BMD|bone mineral density]] is an assessment of the quantity of bone. It does not provide information on bone quality, another important parameter to describe the bone. In addition, clinical risk factors for fracture are at best an indirect assessment of the bone quality. One way to describe the quality of the bone is to assess its microarchitecture. Bone microarchitecture is related to the mechanical strength of bone and hence its greater or lesser risk of fracture. Indeed, for the same quantity of bone, different mechanically resistant bone structures may exist (few large trabeculae or numerous thin trabeculae that are mechanically stronger). Actually, bone loss is often accompanied by a deterioration of bone architecture, resulted in a decreased number of trabeculae, increased inter-trabecular distances, and a loss connectivity of the trabecular meshwork. Moreover, reduction of [[cortical bone]] thickness and increased porosity accompany trabecular bone loss, and in particular promote the fragility of the femoral neck. Osteoporotic bone is called "porous".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The trabecular bone score) is a textural parameter that can be applied to [[DXA images|DEXA]], which quantifies the local variations in gray level. TBS is derived from the evaluation of the experimental variogram, obtained from the grayscale [[DXA image|DEXA]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

It was found that TBS is a reflection of the structural condition of the bone microarchitecture. TBS is strongly correlated with the number of [[trabeculae]] and their connectivity and negatively with the space between trabeculae.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jocd.2011.05.005 |title=Correlations Between Trabecular Bone Score, Measured Using Anteroposterior Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Acquisition, and 3-Dimensional Parameters of Bone Microarchitecture: An Experimental Study on Human Cadaver Vertebrae |year=2011 |last1=Hans |first1=Didier |last2=Barthe |first2=Nicole |last3=Boutroy |first3=Stephanie |last4=Pothuaud |first4=Laurent |last5=Winzenrieth |first5=Renaud |last6=Krieg |first6=Marc-Antoine |journal=Journal of Clinical Densitometry |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=302–12 |pmid=21724435}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jocd.2011.02.056 |title=Assessment of correlations between 3D μCT microarchitecture parameters and TBS: Effects of resolution and correlation with TBS DXA measurements |year=2011 |last1=Piveteau |first1=Teddy |last2=Winzenrieth |first2=Renaud |last3=Hans |first3=Didier |journal=Journal of Clinical Densitometry |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=169}}</ref> That is to say that a high TBS value means that microarchitecture bone is dense, well connected with little spaces between trabeculaes.

All these studies have shown that TBS can be used as a clinical risk factor for osteoporotic fracture since it is reversible (with or without treatment), quantitative and independent of BMD. It should therefore be used as such in the same way that taking corticosteroids, rheumatoid arthritis or prevalent fracture after age 50.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
