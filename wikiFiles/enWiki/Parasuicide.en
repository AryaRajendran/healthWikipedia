{{Suicide}}
'''Parasuicide''' (Greek "παρά", ''para-'', "near" or "resembling", + suicide) refers to [[suicide]] attempts or gestures and [[self-harm]] where there is no result in [[death]]. It is a non-fatal act in which a person deliberately causes injury to him or herself or ingests any prescribed or generally recognised therapeutic dose in excess. The term was first coined in Edinburgh by  [[Norman Kreitman]] <ref>Kreitman N., Parasuicide. Chichester: Wiley, 1977</ref> It is considered to be a serious [[public health]] issue. Parasuicide is the strongest known indicator for a future successful suicide attempt.<ref name=Welch-2001>{{Cite journal |last=Welch |first=SS |title=A review of the literature on the epidemiology of parasuicide in the general population |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/52/3/368 |journal= Psychiatr Serv |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=368–75 |month=Mar |year=2001 |pmid=11239107}}</ref> Other researchers also include those who attempt suicide with the intent to kill themselves in the definition of parasuicide.

==Suicidal gestures==
Examples of suicidal gestures include cutting, where the cut is not deep enough to cause significant blood loss, or taking a non-lethal overdose of medication. This differs from [[self-harm]] in that, in self-harm, the person's primary intention is to relieve unbearable emotions, sensations of unreality, or feelings of numbness by injuring their body. Suicidal gestures are typically done to alert others of the seriousness of the individual's [[clinical depression]] and [[suicidal ideation]], and are usually treated as actual suicide attempts by hospital staff. Some suicidal gestures do lead to death, despite the individual not having the intention of dying. Studies show that 1% of patients who self-harm will complete suicide within two years of the first act.<ref>Semple, David. "Oxford handbook of Psychiatry" 2005.</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Nearly half of all [[suicide]]s are preceded by an attempt at suicide that does not end in death. Those with a history of such attempts are 23 times more likely to eventually end their own lives than those without.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shaffer |first=DJ |year=1988 |month=September |title=The Epidemiology of Teen Suicide: An Examination of Risk Factors |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Psychiatry]] |volume=49 |issue=supp. |pages=36–41 |pmid=3047106 |accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref>

Those who attempt to harm themselves are, as a group, quite different from those who actually die from suicide; females attempt suicide much more frequently than males do, but males are four times more likely to die from suicide.<ref>National Center for Health Statistics. [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf Deaths: Injuries, 2002]. Retrieved on 21 October 2007.</ref> The incidence of parasuicide ranges from as low as 2.6 to as high as 1,100 per 100,000 people per year. The lifetime incidence of parasuicide has been estimated as low as 720 and as high as 5,930 per 100,000 people. Parasuicide is more likely to occur in younger people and females. Other risk factors include being single or being divorced, unemployment, recent change in living condition, mental illness, ill health and a history of parasuicide. Substance abuse, especially alcohol, is highly associated with parasuicide.<ref name=Welch-2001/>

One study found that [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] could be a factor in parasuicide. A high level of perfectionism was found in patients that had been hospitalised for parasuicide and the study suggests that perfectionism is more likely to lead to feelings of failure, therefore making a suicide attempt or parasuicide more likely.<ref>{{Cite pmid|18664231}}</ref>
