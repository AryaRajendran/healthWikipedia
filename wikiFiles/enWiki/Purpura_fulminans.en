'''Purpura fulminans''' (also known as "Purpura gangrenosa"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|825}}) is a haemorrhagic condition usually associated with [[sepsis]] or previous infection. It occurs mainly in babies and small children. 

It was first described by Guelliot in 1884.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Guelliot A|year=1884|title=Note sur trois cas de purpusa infectieux foudroyant|journal=Un Med Sci Nord-Est|volume=8|pages=25}}</ref>

== Presentation ==
It is a life-threatening disorder of acute onset. It is characterized by cutaneous [[haemorrhage]] and [[necrosis]] (tissue death), low [[blood pressure]], [[fever]] and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].<ref>Murray, Patrick R.; Rosenthal, Ken S.; Pfaller, Michael A. (2009) ''Medical Microbiology''. Mosby Elsevier. Chapter 21 "staphylococcus and other related gram-positive cocci" page 218</ref>

== Causes ==
Common causes are severe infection (especially with [[meningococcus]], and ''[[Capnocytophaga canimorsus]]'', and other Gram-negative organisms),<ref name=Nolan>{{cite journal |title=Review of management of purpura fulminans and two case reports |journal=British journal of anaesthesia |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=581–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11573639 |doi=10.1093/bja/86.4.581 |author1=Nolan J |author2=Sinclair R |author-separator=,}}</ref> and deficiency of the natural anticoagulants [[protein C]] or [[protein S]] in the blood.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Neonatal purpura fulminans: a genetic disorder related to the absence of protein C in blood |journal=Blood |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=15–20 |year=1985 |pmid=3838081 |doi= |author1=Marciniak E |author2=Wilson HD |author3=Marlar RA |author-separator=,}}</ref> In some cases, a cause is never found.<ref name=Nolan/>

== Treatment ==
Treatment is mainly by removing the underlying cause and degree of clotting abnormalities and with supportive treatment (antibiotics, volume expansion, tissue oxygenation, etc.). Thus, treatment includes aggressive management of the septic state. Surgical [[debridement]], [[escharotomy|escharotomies]], [[fasciotomy|fasciotomies]], and even [[amputation]]s. In many cases, digits may need to be amputated when their blood supply has ceased completely.<ref name=Nolan/>
The use of full dose [[heparin]] or other [[anticoagulant]] is controversial.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

It is often difficult to determine tissue viability during the resuscitation phase and debridement and amputation should therefore ideally be deferred until demarcation has taken place.
