'''Intraocular pressure''' (IOP) is the fluid [[pressure]] inside the [[human eye|eye]]. [[Ocular tonometry|Tonometry]] is the method [[eye care professional]]s use to determine this. IOP is an important aspect in the evaluation of patients at risk from [[glaucoma]]. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury ([[mmHg]]).

==Physiology==
Intraocular pressure is mainly determined by the coupling of the production of [[aqueous humor]] and the drainage of aqueous humor mainly through the [[trabecular meshwork]] located in the [[anterior chamber]] angle. 

An important quantitative relationship is provided below:
:IOP = F / C + PV 
Where F = aqueous fluid formation rate, C = outflow rate, PV = episcleral venous pressure.
The above factors are those that drive IOP.

==Measurement==
Intraocular pressure is measured with a [[Ocular tonometry|tonometer]] as part of a comprehensive [[eye examination]].

Measured values of intraocular pressure are influenced by [[cornea]]l thickness and rigidity.<ref name=Grieshaber>{{Cite journal|author=Grieshaber MC, Schoetzau A, Zawinka C, Flammer J, Orgul S|title=Effect of Central Corneal Thickness on Dynamic Contour Tonometry and Goldmann Applanation Tonometry in Primary Open-angle Glaucoma|journal=Arch Ophthalmol.|volume=125|issue=6|pages=740–44|year=2007|month=June|url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/125/6/740|pmid=17562982|doi=10.1001/archopht.125.6.740}}</ref><ref name=Tanaka>{{Cite journal|author=Tanaka GH|title=Corneal pachymetry: a prerequisite for applanation tonometry?|journal=Arch Ophthalmol.|volume=116|issue=4|pages=544–5|year=1998|month=April|url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/116/4/544|pmid=9565063}}</ref> As a result, some forms of [[refractive surgery]] (such as [[photorefractive keratectomy]]) can cause traditional intraocular pressure measurements to appear normal when in fact the pressure may be abnormally high.

==Classification==
Current consensus among ophthalmologists and optometrists define normal intraocular pressure as that between 10 [[mmHg]] and 20 mmHg.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/hw/lab_tests/hw201323.asp webMD - Tonometry]</ref><ref>[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/14545-1.asp Glaucoma Overview] from eMedicine</ref> The average value of intraocular pressure is 15.5 mmHg with fluctuations of about 2.75 mmHg.<ref name=Janunts>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniklinikum-saarland.de/de/einrichtungen/kliniken_institute/experimentelle_ophthalmologie/forschung/iop_sensing/| title=Optical remote sensing of intraocular pressure by an implantable nanostructured array

[[Ocular hypertension]] (OHT) is defined by intraocular pressure being higher than normal, in the absence of [[optic nerve]] damage or [[visual field]] loss.<ref name="Vieira">{{cite journal |author=Viera GM, Oliveira HB, de Andrade DT, Bottaro M, Ritch R |title=Intraocular Pressure Variation During Weight Lifting |journal=Arch Ophthalmol. |volume=124 |issue=9 |pages=1251–54 |year=2006 |month=September |url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/124/9/1251 |pmid=16966619 |doi=10.1001/archopht.124.9.1251}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aoa.org/ocular-hypertension.xml American Optometric Association - Ocular Hypertension]</ref>

Hypotony, or ocular hypotony, is typically defined as intraocular pressure equal to or less than 5 mmHg.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1207657-overview eMedicine - Ocular Hypotony - Author: Sheila P Sanders, MD]</ref><ref name="Henderer">{{cite journal |author=Henderer JD, Budenz DL, Flynn HW Jr, Schiffman JC, Feuer WJ, Murray TG |title=Elevated Intraocular Pressure and Hypotony Following Silicone Oil Retinal Tamponade for Complex Retinal Detachment: Incidence and Risk Factors |journal=Arch Ophthalmol. |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=189–95 |year=1999 |month=February |url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/2/189 |pmid=10037563 }}</ref> Such low intraocular pressure could indicate fluid leakage and deflation of the eyeball.

==Influencing factors==

=== Daily variation ===
Intraocular pressure varies throughout the night and day. The diurnal variation for normal eyes is between 3 and 6 mmHg and the variation may increase in glaucomatous eyes. During the night, intraocular pressure may not decrease<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu JHK|coauthors=Weinreb RN|title=Monitoring intraocular pressure for 24 h|journal=Br J Ophthalmol|year=2011|volume=95|issue=5|pages=599–600}}</ref>  despite the slower production of aqueous humour.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brubaker RF|title=Flow of aqueous humor in humans|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci|year=1991|volume=32|issue=13|pages=3145–3166}}</ref> In the general population, IOP ranges between 10 and 21&nbsp;mm Hg with a mean of about 15 or 16&nbsp;mm Hg (plus or minus 3.5&nbsp;mm Hg during a 24-hour cycle).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

=== Fitness and exercise ===
Studies have been conducted on both healthy and sedentary individuals to determine if intraocular pressure could be reduced with exercise. Some forms of exertion have been found to result in a decrease in intraocular pressure. Exercises studied included; walking, jogging, and running. These studies indicate the possibility that other exercise may also reduce intraocular pressure such as yoga, tai chi, pilates, and aerobics.<ref>[http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/medical/issues/sag-00-30-2/sag-30-2-20-9907-19.pdf Acute Dynamic Exercise Reduces Intraocular Pressure, Departments of Ophthalmology, Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Atatürk University, Erzurum- Turkey. July 1999.]</ref><ref>[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03014469500004202 Qureshi IA. Effects of mild, moderate and severe exercise on intraocular pressure of sedentary subjects. Rawalpindi Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan]</ref> However, some other forms of exercise may raise IOP.<ref name="Vieira" />

=== Other factors ===
Intraocular pressure also varies with a number of other factors such as [[heart]] rate, [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], fluid intake, systemic medication and topical drugs. [[Alcohol]] consumption leads to a transient decrease in intraocular pressure and [[caffeine]] may increase intraocular pressure.<ref>Intraocular pressure measure on normal eyes by Pardianto G et al., in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2005;2:78-9.</ref>

Taken orally, [[glycerol]] (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste) can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in intraocular pressure.  This can be a useful initial emergency treatment of severely elevated pressure.<ref>Effect of Oral Glycerol on Intraocular Pressure in Normal and Glaucomatous Eyes, S. M. Drance, MD, FRCS (ENG) ''Arch Ophthalmol.'' 1964;72(4):491-493. doi:10.1001/archopht.1964.00970020491009</ref>

==Significance==
Ocular hypertension is the most important risk factor for [[glaucoma]].

Differences in pressure between the two eyes is often clinically significant, and potentially associated with certain types of glaucoma, as well as  [[iritis]] or [[retinal detachment]].

Intraocular pressure may become elevated due to anatomical problems, [[inflammation]] of the eye, genetic factors, or as a [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]] from [[medication]]. Intraocular pressure usually increases with age and is genetically influenced.<ref>Intraocular pressure measure on normal eyes by Pardianto G et al., in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2005;2: 80.</ref>
