'''Mouth breathing''' refers to the state of [[inhaling]] and [[Exhalation|exhaling]] through the [[mouth]].

A healthy individual normally breathes through the [[nasal breathing|nose]] while resting or doing light exercise, and breathes simultaneously through both the nose and mouth during vigorous [[aerobic exercise]], in order to supply sufficient oxygen.  

Mouth breathing in children can be a cause of abnormal facial growth primarily in the upper and lower jaw shape, leading to [[Long Face Syndrome]] or other malocclusions.<ref>R.M.
