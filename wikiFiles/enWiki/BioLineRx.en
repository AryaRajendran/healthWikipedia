=== Business model ===
{{See also|Bench to bedside|Proof of concept}}
BioLine's [[business model]] consists of three stages. In the first stage, called the ''bench'' stage, the potential drug candidate is evaluated "from both scientific and marketing perspectives." In the second stage, called the ''bedside'' stage, BioLine accompanies the drug through early [[clinical trial]]s. In the third stage, the ''partner'' stage, BioLine enters into strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company to see the drug through its advanced clinical trials and bring it to the market.<ref>{{cite web|title=BioLineRx – Overview|url=http://www.biolinerx.com/default.asp?pageid=11|publisher=BioLineRx|accessdate=28 November 2011|year=2010}}</ref>
