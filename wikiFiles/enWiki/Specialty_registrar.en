'''Specialty Registrar''' is a new training grade introduced in 2007 into UK medical training as part of the [[Modernising Medical Careers]] programme. It is intended to replace the old Specialist Registrar training places used to train doctors up to the [[Medical specialist|specialist]] level needed to become a [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[physician|Doctor]]. In the UK medical system, a specialist is someone who has the necessary experience and qualifications to be placed on the [[General Medical Council|GMC]]'s Specialist Register. Only persons on the Specialist Register can be appointed consultants in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).

Training to become a [[General Practice|General Practitioner]] will also involve a Specialty Registrar training scheme and completion will lead to eligibility for entry on the General Practice Register.<ref name="MMCFramework">{{cite web | title = MMC Career Framework | publisher = MMC | url = http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/pages/specialities/specialityframework | accessdate = 2007-06-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614094043/http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/pages/specialities/specialityframework <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-14}}</ref>

Specialty Registrar training involves structured specialist or general practitioner training programmes that begin directly after completion of the 2 year [[Foundation Year 1|foundation training]] programme.<ref name="MMCFramework" /> Completing the training scheme will lead to the award of a [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] (CCT), subject to satisfactory in-training assessment and progress; this is a necessary pre-requisite for entry onto the Specialist Register  or GP Register.<ref name="MMCFramework" />

The curricula used for the different specialty training schemes will be set by the relevant [[medical royal college]].<ref name="MMCFramework2">{{cite web | title = Arrangements for the introduction of the new career framework | publisher = MMC | url = http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/pages/speciality-introduction | accessdate = 2007-06-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070602143522/http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/pages/speciality-introduction <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-02}}</ref> Under the old system, before applying for the old [[Specialist registrar|Registrar]] posts, applicants were required to have sat and passed part, or all, of a medical royal college's membership examinations while still a [[Senior House Officer]].
