'''Porotic hyperostosis''', also known as '''osteoporosis symmetrica''', '''cribra crani''', '''hyperostosis spongiosa''', and '''symmetrical [[osteoporosis]]'''. is a disease that causes bone tissue to become soft and spongy.<ref name="El-Najjar">El-Najjar M and Robertson Jr AL. 1976.

The overgrowth of the skull's marrow may cause the outer table of the bones to move and become thinner.<ref name="cule">Cule J and Evans IL. 1968.

In [[anthropology]], presence of the condition is used by researchers to detect malnourished populations. Anthropologists can look at bones of people from ancient populations and learn about their diets and lifestyles, a discipline known as paleonutrition.  A high [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the disease indicates the population adapted poorly to its environment or was under nutritional stress.<ref name="Stuart-Macadam"/>  A low level of [[iron]] in the blood is also a defense against [[pathogen]]s, so a high incidence of the disease in a population could also indicate an attempt to fight off a [[microorganism]].<ref name="Stuart-Macadam"/>  From this perspective, porotic hyperostosis could be viewed as an adaptation to the environment, rather than an indicator of malnutrition.
