==Career==
In 1993, Brotto graduated Johnston Heights High School in [[Surrey, British Columbia]]. Brotto attended the [[University of British Columbia]], earning a [[biopsychology]] [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1997, a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in 1999, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[clinical psychology]] in 2003. In 2003, she completed a one-year internship in the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of Washington]], followed by a two-year Postdoctoral Fellowship in Reproductive and Sexual Medicine. Brotto was licensed as a Psychologist in the Province of British Columbia in 2005 and has held a position in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of British Columbia since 2005.

Brotto is a member of the [[International Academy of Sex Research]], the [[International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health]], the [[Society for Sex Therapy and Research]], the [[Canadian Sex Research Forum]], and the [[Canadian Psychological Association]]. She is an Associate Editor for the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', on the editorial board for ''[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]],'' and a consulting editor for the ''[[Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy]]''. 

Brotto specializes in sexual issues for women during and after treatment for gynecological [[cancer]], saying that "50% to almost 100% of women following gynaecological cancer do report some degree of sexual impairment depending on the kind of cancer treatment they've had."<ref name="swan2008">Swan, Norman (June 23, 2008).

[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070914190618.htm Sex After Cancer.] ''[[Science Daily|ScienceDaily]]''.</ref> In 2005 Brotto launched North America's first study to explore a mindfulness-based treatment aimed at helping cancer survivors treated with radical hysterectomy regain their sexual health.<ref name="thomson2004">Thomson, Hilary (December 2, 2004). ''UBC Reports'', Vol. 50, No. 11</ref> To Brotto, the one defining feature of sexual dysfunction is the level of interference it causes. "If lack of desire or inability to reach orgasm interferes in a woman's life, distresses her, or creates a burden on her relationship with her partner, then it could do with some fixing. If it doesn't, then leave well enough alone."<ref name="bryan2005">Bryan, Helena (June 30, 2005). [http://www.straight.com/article/female-orgasms-not-always-on-the-menu? Female orgasms not always on the menu.] ''[[The Georgia Straight]]''</ref> She coauthored two chapters on managing FSAD and low sexual desire in women in the 2009 publication ''Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders'' edited by [[Richard Balon]] and [[Robert Taylor Segraves]].

More recently, inspired by the work of [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]],  Brotto has been involved in the subject of mindfulness meditation skills for women with problems of low sexual desire/loss of arousal, sexual distress associated with sexual abuse. She is also interested sexual difficulties associated with gynaecologic and colorectal cancers (men and women), and women with provoked vestibulodynia (genital pain).{{cn|date=April 2013}}, and outcome research focused on psychological and mindfulness-based methods in the treatment of sexual dysfunction.<ref name="Suttie2013">Suttie, Jill (January 30, 2013).
