A '''lacto vegetarian''' (sometimes referred to as a '''lactarian'''; from the [[Latin]] '''lactis''', ''milk'') diet is a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet that includes [[dairy product]]s such as [[milk]], [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[butter]], [[ghee]], [[cream]], and [[kefir]], but excludes [[egg (food)|eggs]]. Lacto-vegetarians also abstain from cheeses that include animal [[rennet]] and yogurts that contain [[gelatin]]. The concept and practice of lacto-vegetarianism among a significant number of people comes from [[ancient India]]<ref>Spencer, Colin: ''The Heretic’s Feast. A History of Vegetarianism'', London: Fourth Estate 1993, p. 69–84. ISBN 1-85702-078-2.</ref> and was originally based on religious beliefs.<ref name=vegan002>[http://www.ivu.org/history/renaissance/words.html Some background to 'vegetarian' and 'vegan']</ref>

The greatest proportion of vegetarians, such as those in [[India]] or those in the area of the classical [[Mediterranean]] such as the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], are or were lacto-vegetarian.<ref name=vegan002/>

Lacto-vegetarian diets are popular with many followers of the [[Eastern religion|Eastern]] religious traditions such as  [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The cores of their beliefs are behind a lacto-vegetarian diet is the law of [[ahimsa]], or non-violence.<ref>''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50-52.</ref> According to the [[Vedas]], (Hindu holy scriptures), all living beings are equally valued.<ref>[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/5/18/en1 Bhagavad Gita 5.18] "The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]."</ref><ref name="hinduwebsite.com">[http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/essays/animals.asp Animals in Hinduism, second paragraph]</ref> Also, Hindus believe that one's personality is affected by the kind of food one consumes, and eating flesh is considered bad for one's spiritual/mental well-being. It takes many more vegetables or plants to produce an equal amount of meat,<ref name=feed800>[http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/livestock.hrs.html U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat]</ref> many more lives are destroyed, and in this way more suffering is caused when meat is consumed.<ref name=Gabriel001>Gabriel Cousens, Spiritual Nutrition: Six Foundations for Spiritual Life and the Awakening of Kundalini, North Athlantic Books, page 251</ref> In the case of Jainism, the vegetarian standards are even more strict. It allows the consumption of only fruit and leaves that can be taken from plants without causing their death. This further excludes from the diet vegetables like [[carrots]], [[potatoes]], and [[onions]]. Although some suffering and pain is inevitably caused to other living beings to satisfy the human need for food, according to ahimsa, every effort should be made to minimize suffering.<ref name=Gabriel001/> This is to avoid [[Karma|karmic consequences]] and show respect for living things. In this sense, wastage of food is considered a sin. Because all living beings are equally valued in these traditions,<ref name="hinduwebsite.com"/> a vegetarian diet rooted in [[ahimsa]] is only one aspect of environmentally conscious living, relating to those beings affected by our need for food.<ref name=Gabriel001/> Environmentalism and vegetarianism are often practiced together.<ref>[http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/stories/stuff-environmentalists-like  Many environmentalists are vegetarian.]</ref><ref>[http://www.miamacdonald.com/a.php?id=27 Maneka Gandhi and Ahimsa]</ref>

==Lacto-vegetarians and Vegans==

One of the main differences between a [[veganism|vegan]] and a lacto vegetarian diet is the avoidance of dairy products. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy because they state that their production causes the animal suffering and/or a premature death.<ref name=marcus>{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|date=2000|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>
