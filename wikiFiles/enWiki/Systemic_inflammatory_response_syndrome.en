'''Systemic inflammatory response syndrome''' ('''SIRS''') is an [[inflammation|inflammatory state]] affecting the whole body, frequently a response of the [[immune system]] to [[infection]], but not necessarily so. It is related to [[sepsis]], a condition in which individuals both meet criteria for SIRS and have a known or highly suspected infection.

==Classification==
SIRS is a serious condition related to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and organ failure. It is a subset of [[cytokine storm]], in which there is abnormal regulation of various [[cytokine]]s.<ref>Parsons, Melissa, [http://www.aphon.org/files/public/JOPON_aug-sep10_Cytokine.pdf Cytokine Storm in the Pediatric Oncology Patient] (section "Differential Diagnoses and Workup", Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing, 27(5) Aug/Sep 2010, 253–258.</ref> SIRS is also closely related to [[sepsis]], in which patients satisfy criteria for SIRS and have a suspected or proven infection.<ref name="accp"/><ref name=rippe/><ref name=marino/>

==Definition==
{{SIRS}}SIRS was first described by Dr. William R. Nelson, of the University of Toronto, in a presentation to the Nordic Micro Circulation meeting in Geilo, Norway in February 1983. There was intent to encourage a definition which dealt with the multiple (rather than a single) etiologies associated with organ dysfunction and failure following a [[Shock (circulatory)|hypotensive shock]] episode.  The active pathways leading to such pathophysiology may include [[fibrin]] deposition, [[Platelet#Adhesion_and_aggregation|platelet aggregation]], [[Coagulopathy|coagulopathies]] and [[leukemoid reaction|leukocyte liposomal release]].  The implication of such a definition suggests that recognition of the activation of one such pathway is often indicative of that additional pathophysiologic processes are also active and that these pathways are synergistically destructive. The clinical condition may lead to [[renal failure]], [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], [[central nervous system]] dysfunction and possible [[gastrointestinal bleeding]]. 

Criteria for SIRS were established in 1992 as part of the [[American College of Chest Physicians]]/[[Society of Critical Care Medicine]] Consensus Conference.<ref name="accp">{{cite journal |author= |title=American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference: definitions for sepsis and organ failure and guidelines for the use of innovative therapies in sepsis |journal=Crit.

* [[Normal human body temperature|Body temperature]] less than 36°C(96.8°F) or greater than 38°C(100.4°F)
* [[Heart rate]] greater than 90 beats per minute
* [[Tachypnea]] (high respiratory rate), with greater than 20 breaths per minute; or, an arterial [[partial pressure]] of [[carbon dioxide]] less than 4.3 kPa (32 mmHg)
* [[leukocytes]] less than 4000 cells/mm³ (4 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L) or greater than 12,000 cells/mm³ (12 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L); or the presence of greater than 10% [[immature neutrophil]]s (band forms)

SIRS can be diagnosed when two or more of these criteria are present.<ref name="rippe">{{cite book |author=Rippe, James M.; Irwin, Richard S.; Cerra, Frank B |title=Irwin and Rippe's intensive care medicine |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |location=Philadelphia |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-1425-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="marino">{{cite book |author=Marino, Paul L. |title=The ICU book |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-683-05565-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>Sharma S, Steven M.

The International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus has proposed some changes to adapt these criteria to the pediatric population.<ref>[http://www.vritdraugija.lt/index_files/DODS%20kriterijai%20(PCCM%202005).pdf Brahm Goldstein et al., International pediatric sepsis consensus, Pediatr Crit Care Med 2005 Vol. 6, No. 1]</ref>

Fever and [[leukocytosis]] are features of the [[acute-phase reaction]], while [[tachycardia]] is often the initial sign of hemodynamic compromise. [[Tachypnea]] may be related to the increased metabolic stress due to infection and inflammation, but may also be an ominous sign of inadequate [[perfusion]] resulting in the onset of anaerobic cellular metabolism.

In children, the SIRS criteria are modified in the following fashion:<ref name="pmid15636651">{{cite journal |author=Goldstein B, Giroir B, Randolph A |title=International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics |journal=Pediatr Crit Care Med |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15636651 |doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000149131.72248.E6 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1529-7535&volume=6&issue=1&spage=2}}</ref>

* [[Heart rate]] is greater than 2 [[standard deviations]] above normal for age in the absence of stimuli such as pain and drug administration, or unexplained persistent elevation for greater than 30 minutes to 4 hours. In infants, also includes [[Heart rate]] less than 10th percentile for age in the absence of [[vagal stimuli]], [[beta-blockers]], or [[congenital heart disease]] or unexplained persistent depression for greater than 30 minutes.
* [[Body temperature]] obtained orally, rectally, from [[Foley catheter]] probe, or from [[central venous catheter]] probe less than 36&nbsp;°C or greater than 38.5&nbsp;°C. Temperature must be abnormal to qualify as SIRS in pediatric patients.
* [[Respiratory rate]] greater than 2 [[standard deviations]] above normal for age or the requirement for [[mechanical ventilation]] not related to neuromuscular disease or the administration of [[anesthesia]].
* [[White blood cell]] count elevated or depressed for age not related to chemotherapy, or greater than 10% bands plus other immature forms.

Note that SIRS criteria are non-specific,<ref name="Levy">{{cite journal |author=Levy MM, Fink MP, Marshall JC, Abraham E, Angus D, Cook D, Cohen J, Opal SM, Vincent JL, Ramsay G |title=2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference |journal=Crit Care Med |year=2003 |month=Apr |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1250–1256 |url=http://www.ccmjournal.com/pt/re/ccm/abstract.00003246-200304000-00038.htm |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000050454.01978.3B |pmid=12682500}}</ref> and must be interpreted carefully within the clinical context. These criteria exist primarily for the purpose of more objectively classifying critically ill patients so that future clinical studies may be more rigorous and more easily reproducible.

As an alternative, when two or more of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria are met without evidence of infection, patients may be diagnosed simply with "SIRS." Patients with SIRS and acute organ dysfunction may be termed "severe SIRS."

==Causes==
The causes of SIRS are broadly classified as infectious or noninfectious. As above, when SIRS is due to an infection, it is considered [[sepsis]]. Noninfectious causes of SIRS include [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[burn (injury)|burns]], [[pancreatitis]], [[ischemia]], and [[hemorrhage]].<ref name="accp"/><ref name=rippe/><ref name=marino/>

Other causes include:<ref name="accp"/><ref name=rippe/><ref name=marino/>
* Complications of surgery
* [[Adrenal insufficiency]]
* [[Pulmonary embolism]]
* Complicated [[aortic aneurysm]]
* [[Cardiac tamponade]]
* [[Anaphylaxis]]
* Drug overdose
* Polypropylene Mesh Surgical Implant

==Treatment==
Generally, the treatment for SIRS is directed towards the underlying problem or inciting cause (i.e. adequate fluid replacement for hypovolemia, IVF/NPO for pancreatitis, epinephrine/steroids/diphenhydramine for anaphylaxis).[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/168943-treatment], removal (explantation) of polypropylene surgical mesh implant (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1345243/
[[Selenium]], [[glutamine]], and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] have shown effectiveness in improving symptoms in clinical trials.<ref name="pmid17713413">{{cite journal |author=Berger MM, Chioléro RL |title=Antioxidant supplementation in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=35 |issue=9 Suppl |pages=S584–90 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17713413 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000279189.81529.C4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rinaldi|first=S|coauthors=Landucci, F, De Gaudio, AR|title=Antioxidant therapy in critically septic patients.|journal=Current drug targets|date=2009 Sep|volume=10|issue=9|pages=872–80|pmid=19799541|doi=10.2174/138945009789108774}}</ref> Other antioxidants such as [[vitamin E]] may be helpful as well.<ref name="pmid12578114">{{cite journal |author=Bulger EM, Maier RV |title=An argument for Vitamin E supplementation in the management of systemic inflammatory response syndrome |journal=Shock |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–103 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12578114 |doi= 10.1097/00024382-200302000-00001}}</ref>

==Complications==
SIRS is frequently complicated by failure of one or more organs or [[organ system]]s.<ref name="accp"/><ref name=rippe/><ref name=marino/> The complications of SIRS include:
* [[Acute lung injury]]
* [[Acute kidney injury]]
* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]
* [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]
