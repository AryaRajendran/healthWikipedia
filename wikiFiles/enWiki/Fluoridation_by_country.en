=== Nigeria ===

Only a small fraction of Nigerians receive water from waterworks, so water fluoridation would affect only a few people. About 20% of water sources are naturally fluoridated to recommended levels, about 80% have fluoride below recommended levels, and the remainder are above recommended levels.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Akpata ES, Danfillo IS, Otoh EC, Mafeni JO |title=Geographical mapping of fluoride levels in drinking water sources in Nigeria |journal=Afr Health Sci |date=2009 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=227–33 |doi= |url=http://ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/viewFile/52143/40772 |format=PDF }}</ref>

===South Africa===
[[South Africa]]'s Health Department recommends adding fluoridation chemicals to drinking water in some areas. It also advises removal of fluoride from drinking water (defluoridation) where the fluoride content is too high.<ref>[http://www.doh.gov.za/department/fluoridation.html "Water Fluoridation - The Facts"], from South Africa's [http://www.doh.gov.za/department/ Department of Health] website, page accessed April 29, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.africanwater.org/randwater_fluoride.htm The Water Page - Rand Water and Fluoridation]</ref>

Legislation around mandatory fluoridation was introduced in 2002, but has been on hold since then pending further research after opposition from water companies, municipalities and the public.<ref>http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=125&art_id=vn20030108054021972C918779</ref>

===China===
In [[China]], water fluoridation began in 1965 in the urban area of [[Guangzhou]]. It was interrupted during 1976–1978 due to the shortage of sodium silico-fluoride. It was resumed only in the Fangcun district of the city, due to objections, and was halted in 1983. The fluoridation reduced the number of cavities, but increased dental fluorosis; the fluoride levels could have been set too high, and low-quality equipment led to inconsistent, and often excessive, fluoride concentrations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Petersen PE, Kwan S, Zhu L, Zhang BX, Bian JY |title=Effective use of fluorides in the People's Republic of China--a model for WHO Mega Country initiatives |journal=Community Dental Health |volume=25 |issue=4 Suppl 1 |pages=257–67 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19202775 |doi=10.1922/CDH_2475Petersen11}}</ref>  As of 2002, there was no water fluoridation in China.<ref name=FL35>

They recommended other ways of reducing tooth decay (improving food and oral hygiene habits) instead of fluoridating tap water. They also found that many people found fluoridation to impinge upon personal liberty/freedom of choice by forcing them to be medicated, and that the long-term effects of fluoridation were insufficiently acknowledged. They also lacked a proper study on the effects of fluoridation on formula-fed infants.<ref name=Larsson1981/>{{rp|29}}

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]] since 1962 two fluoridation programmes had operated in tandem: water fluoridation in the City of Basel, and salt fluoridation in the rest of Switzerland (around 83% of domestic salt sold had fluoride added).  However it became increasingly difficult to keep the two programmes separate.  As a result some of the population of Basel were assumed to use both fluoridated salt and fluoridated water.  In order to correct that situation, in April 2003 the State Parliament agreed to cease water fluoridation and officially expand salt fluoridation to Basel.<ref>J. MEYER and P.

The water supply in [[Northern Ireland]] has never been artificially fluoridated except in two small localities where fluoride was added to the water for about 30 years. By 1999, fluoridation ceased in those two areas, as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Canada===

The decision whether to fluoridate lies with local governments, with guidelines set by provincial, territorial, and federal governments. Brantford, Ontario became the first city in Canada to fluoridate its water supplies in 1945.<ref name=Rabb-Waytowich/> In 1955, Toronto approved water fluoridation, but delayed implementation of the program until 1963 due to a campaign against fluoridation by broadcaster [[Gordon Sinclair]].<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-75-341-1816/science_technology/fluoride/clip4 "Gordon Sinclair's rant"], from the [http://archives.cbc.ca/index.asp?IDLan=1 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Archives] website, page accessed March 27, 2006.</ref>  The city continues to fluoridate its water today.<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/supply_facilities/rlclark/filtration_process.htm "Water supply - R.

{{main|Water fluoridation in Australia}}

[[Australia]] now provides fluoridated water for 70% or more of the population in all states and territories. Many of Australia's drinking water supplies began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1984 almost 66% of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water, represented by 850 towns and cities.<ref name="parliament">[http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/downloads/reports/1SP%20Flouridation%20part%201%20of%204.pdf Inquiry into Water Fluoridation in the ACT - Report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy, 1991]</ref><ref name="commonwealth">Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water: A Collection. 9; Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water in Australia 1984 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1985), 13.</ref> Some areas within Australia have [[Fluoride#Natural_occurrence|natural fluoride]] levels in the groundwater, which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9% of the population.<ref name="parliament" />

===Brazil===
Water fluoridation was first adopted in [[Brazil]] in the city of [[Baixo Guandu]], [[Espírito Santo|ES]], in 1953.<ref>[http://www.odontologia.com.br/artigos.asp?id=665]</ref> A 1974 federal law required new or enlarged water treatment plants to have fluoridation, and its availability was greatly expanded in the 1980s, with optimum fluoridation levels set at 0.8&nbsp;mg/L. Today, the expansion of fluoridation in Brazil is a governmental priority; state-sponsored research points to a sharp correlation between the availability of fluoridation and benefits to human health.<ref name=portal_saude/> Between 2005 and 2008, fluoridation became available to 7.6 million people in 503 [[municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]].<ref name=portal_saude>[http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/saude/visualizar_texto.cfm?idtxt=23649&janela=1]</ref> As of 2008, 3,351 municipalities, 60.3% of total, adopted fluoridation, up from 2,466 in 2000.<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/pnsb2008/PNSB_2008.pdf]</ref> The proportion of the national population affected is greater, because cities with fluoridation tend to be larger.

===Chile===
In [[Chile]] 70.5% of the population receive fluoridated water (10.1 million added by chemical means, 604,000 naturally occurring).<ref>Information from the Oral Health Department of the Chilean Ministry of Health. December 2004.</ref>
