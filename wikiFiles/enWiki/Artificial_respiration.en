'''Artificial respiration''' is the act of assisting or stimulating [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body by pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tortora|first=Gerard J|coauthors=Derrickson, Bryan|title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.}}</ref>  Assistance takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for a person who is not [[breath]]ing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on their own<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009713/artificial-respiration|title=Artificial Respiration|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=2007-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070614094502/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009713/artificial-respiration| archivedate= 14 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> (although it must be used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] to achieve the internal respiration).

Pulmonary anton ventilation (and hence external parts of respiration) is achieved through manual insufflation of the lungs either by the rescuer blowing into the patient's lungs, or by using a mechanical device to do so.  This method of insufflation has been proved more effective than methods which involve mechanical manipulation of the patient's chest or arms, such as the Silvester method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562617/Artificial_Respiration.html|title=Artificial Respiration|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKiCVG5|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref>   It is also known as '''Expired Air Resuscitation''' (EAR), '''Expired Air Ventilation''' (EAV), '''mouth-to-mouth resuscitation''', '''rescue breathing''' or colloquially the '''kiss of life'''.

Artificial respiration is a part of most protocols for performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/cprleaflet|title=Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation model information leafler|publisher=British Medical Association|month=July | year=2002|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12|title=Overview of CPR|publisher=American Heart Association|year=2005|accessdate=2007-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070627015639/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12| archivedate= 27 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> making it an essential skill for [[first aid]].   In some situations, artificial respiration is also performed separately, for instance in near-[[drowning]] and [[opiate]] overdoses.  The performance of artificial respiration in its own is now limited in most protocols to [[health professional]]s, whereas lay first aiders are advised to undertake full CPR in any case where the patient is not breathing sufficiently.

[[Mechanical ventilation]] involves the use of a [[mechanical ventilator]] to move air in and out of the lungs when an individual is unable to breathe on his or her own, for example during [[surgery]] with [[general anesthesia]] or when an individual is in a [[coma]].

==History==

In 1773, physician [[William Hawes (physician)|William Hawes]] (1736–1808) began publicising the power of [[artificial respiration]] to resuscitate people who superficially appeared to have drowned. For a year he paid a reward out of his own pocket to any one bringing him a body rescued from the water within a reasonable time of immersion. [[Thomas Cogan]], another English physician, who had become interested in the same subject during a stay at [[Amsterdam]], where was instituted in 1767 a society for preservation of life from accidents in water, joined Hawes in his crusade. In the summer of 1774 Hawes and Cogan each brought fifteen friends to a meeting at the Chapter Coffee-house, [[Saint Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] Churchyard, where they founded the [[Royal Humane Society]] as a campaigning group for first aid and resuscitation.

Gradually, branches of the Royal Humane Society were set up in other parts of the country, mainly in ports and coastal towns where the risk of drowning was high and by the end of the 19th century the society had upwards of 280 depots throughout the UK, supplied with life-saving apparatus. The earliest of these depots was the Receiving House in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], on the north bank of the [[Serpentine (lake)|Serpentine]], which was built in 1794 on a site granted by [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]. Hyde Park was chosen because tens of thousands of people swam in the [[Serpentine (lake)|Serpentine]] in the summer and ice-skated in the winter. Boats and boatmen were kept to render aid to bathers, and in the winter ice-men were sent round to the different skating grounds in and around [[London]]. The society distributed money-rewards, medals, clasps and testimonials, to those who saved or attempted to save drowning people. It further recognized "all cases of exceptional bravery in rescuing or attempting to rescue persons from [[asphyxia]] in mines, wells, [[blast furnace|blasting furnace]]s, or in sewers where [[sewer gas|foul gas]] may endanger life."

==Insufflations==
[[Image:insulfation2.jpg|thumb|Mouth-to-mouth insufflation]]
'''Insufflation''', also known as 'rescue breaths' or 'ventilations', is the act of mechanically forcing air into a patient's respiratory system.  This can be achieved via a number of methods, which will depend on the situation and equipment available.  All methods require good [[airway management]] to perform, which ensures that the method is effective. These methods include:
* Mouth to mouth - This involves the rescuer making a seal between their mouth and the patient's mouth and 'blowing', to pass air into the patient's body
* Mouth to nose - In some instances, the rescuer may need or wish to form a seal with the patient's nose. Typical reasons for this include [[maxillofacial]] injuries, performing the procedure in water or the remains of vomit in the mouth
* Mouth to mouth and nose - Used on infants (usually up to around 1 year old), as this forms the most effective seal
* Mouth to mask – Most organisations recommend the use of some sort of barrier between rescuer and patient to reduce cross infection risk.  One popular type is the 'pocket mask'.  This may be able to provide higher tidal volumes than a Bag Valve Mask.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Gerald M|title=Mouth to Mouth rescue breathing and comparisons of personal resuscitation masks|journal=Rescue Squad Quarterly|date=Winter 1987|url=http://www.lifesaving.com/issues/articles/30mouth_to_mouth.html|accessdate=2007-06-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070602124950/http://lifesaving.com/issues/articles/30mouth_to_mouth.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-02}}</ref>
* [[Bag valve mask]] (BVM) - This is a simple device manually operated by the rescuer, which involves squeezing a bag to expel air into the patient.
* Mechanical resuscitator - An electric unit designed to breathe for patients

===Adjuncts to insufflation===
[[Image:CPR mask 2.jpg|thumb|A CPR pocket mask, with carrying case]]
Most training organisations recommend that in any of the methods involving mouth to patient, that a protective barrier is used, to minimise the possibility of cross infection (in either direction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/services/hss/resources/eccpr.doc|title=Emergency Cardiovascular Care Revisions for the professional rescuer|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=2007-06-15|format=DOC}}</ref>

Barriers available include pocket masks and keyring-sized face shields.  These barriers are an example of [[Infection control#Personal protective equipment|Personal Protective Equipment]] to guard the face against splashing, spraying or splattering of blood or other potentially infectious materials.

These barriers should provide a one-way filter valve which lets the air from the rescuer deliver to the patient while any substances from the patient (e.g. vomit, blood) cannot reach the rescuer.  Many adjuncts are single use, though if they are multi use, after use of the adjunct, the mask must be cleaned and [[autoclave]]d and the filter replaced. It is very important for the mask to be replaced or cleaned because it can act as an transporter of various diseases. 

The CPR mask is the preferred method of ventilating a patient when only one rescuer is available. Many feature 18mm inlets to support supplemental oxygen, which increases the oxygen being delivered from the approximate 17% available in the expired air of the rescuer to around 40-50%.

[[Tracheal intubation]] is often used for short term mechanical ventilation. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and subglottic stenosis.

In an emergency a [[Cricothyrotomy]] can be used by health care professionals, where an airway is inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]]. This is similar to a [[tracheostomy]] but a [[cricothyrotomy]] is reserved for emergency access.  This is usually only used when there is a complete blockage of the [[pharynx]] or there is massive maxillofacial injury, preventing other adjuncts being used.<ref name="rsi">{{cite journal |author=Carley SD, Gwinnutt C, Butler J, Sammy I, Driscoll P. |title=Rapid sequence induction in the emergency department: a strategy for failure |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |pmid=11904254 |pmc=1725832 |doi=10.1136/emj.19.2.109 |year=2002 |month=March |volume=19 |issue=2 |url=http://emj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/19/2/109 |pages=109–113 |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

==Efficiency of mouth to patient insufflation==
Normal atmospheric air contains approximately 21% oxygen when inhaled in.  After [[gaseous exchange]] has taken place in the lungs, with waste products (notably [[carbon dioxide]]) moved from the bloodstream to the lungs, the air being exhaled by humans normally contains around 17% oxygen.  This means that the human body utilises only around 19% of the oxygen inhaled, leaving over 80% of the oxygen available in the exhalatory breath.<ref>{{cite web | title=Physical Intervention: Life Support (Rescue Breathing)| url=http://www.doitnow.org/pages/208/208-5.html| accessdate=December 29, 2005 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060125011006/http://www.doitnow.org/pages/208/208-5.html| archivedate= 25 January 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

This means that there is more than enough residual oxygen to be used in the lungs of the patient, which then crosses the cell membrane to form oxy[[hemoglobin]].

==Oxygen==
[[Image:CPR-oxygen-defibrillator.jpg|thumb|Typical view of resuscitation in progress with a BVM in use]]
The efficiency of artificial respiration can be greatly increased by the simultaneous use of oxygen therapy.  The amount of oxygen available to the patient in mouth to mouth is around 16%.  If this is done through a pocket mask with an oxygen flow, this increases to 40% oxygen.   If a Bag Valve Mask or mechanical respirator is used with an oxygen supply, this rises to 99% oxygen.  The greater the oxygen concentration, the more efficient the gaseous exchange will be in the lungs.
