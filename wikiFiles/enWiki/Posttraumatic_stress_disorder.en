==Causes==
PTSD is believed to be caused by the experience of a wide range of traumatic events and, particularly if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions.<ref>{{Cite web  | title =Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)  | publisher =National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  | url =http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/who-gets-ptsd.shtml  | accessdate =2011-12-16 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web  | last = Mayo Clinic staff  | title =Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  | publisher =Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research  | url =http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/DS00246/DSECTION=causes  | accessdate =2011-12-16 }}</ref> 

Persons considered at risk include combat military personnel, victims of natural disasters, concentration camp survivors and victims of violent crime. Individuals not infrequently experience "survivor's guilt" for remaining alive while others died. Causes of the symptoms of PTSD are the experiencing or witnessing of a stressor event involving death, serious injury or such threat to the self or others in a situation in which the individual felt intense fear, horror, or powerlessness.<ref name=ASD-PTSD>{{cite journal|last=Fullerton|first=CS|coauthors=Ursano, Wang|title=Acute Stress Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and Depression in Disaster or Rescue Workers|journal=Am J Psychiatry|year=2004|volume=161|pages=1370–1376|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.8.1370|pmid=15285961|issue=8}}</ref>
Persons who are employed in occupations which expose them to violence (such as soldiers) or disasters (such as [[emergency service]] workers) are also at risk.<ref name=ASD-PTSD/>

Children or adults may develop PTSD symptoms by experiencing [[bullying]] or [[mobbing]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelleher I, Harley M, Lynch F, Arseneault L, Fitzpatrick C, Cannon M |title=Associations between childhood trauma, bullying and psychotic symptoms among a school-based adolescent sample |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=193 |issue=5 |pages=378–82 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18978317 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.049536 |url=}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}}<ref>"Are they really out to get your patient?" http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf ''Current Psychiatry'' Volume 8 Number 4</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}}

==Differential diagnosis==
For a diagnosis of PTSD, an extreme stressor such as one that is life threatening. Any stressor can result in a diagnosis of [[Adjustment disorder]] and it is an appropriate diagnosis for a stressor and a symptom pattern that does not meet the criteria for PTSD, for example a stressor like a partner being fired, or a spouse leaving. If any of the symptom pattern is present before the stressor, another diagnosis is required, such as [[Brief psychotic disorder]] or [[Major depressive disorder]]. Other differential diagnoses are [[Schizophrenia]] or other disorders with psychotic features such as Psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. [[Drug-induced psychotic disorders]] can be considered if substance abuse is involved.<ref name=DSM4/>

The symptom pattern for [[Acute stress disorder]] must occur and be resolved within four weeks of the trauma. If it lasts longer, and the symptom pattern fits that characteristic of PTSD, the diagnosis may be changed.<ref name=DSM4/>

[[Obsessive compulsive disorder]] may be diagnosed for intrusive thoughts that are reoccuring but not related to a specific traumatic event.<ref name=DSM4/>

[[Malingering]] should be considered if there is a financial and/or legal advantage is a possibility.

==Other considerations==
===Family violence===
Trauma from family violence can predispose an individual to PTSD. Approximately 25% of children exposed to family violence can experience PTSD in a study of 337 school age children<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=Laura Ann|coauthors=Marla Walker|title=Posttraumatic Stress in Children Exposed to Family Violence and Single-Event Trauma|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2000|month=January|volume=39|issue=1|pages=108–115|doi=10.1097/00004583-200001000-00023|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709661074}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}}  Preliminary research suggests that child abuse may interact with mutations in a stress-related gene to increase the risk of PTSD in adults, in a cross-sectional study of 900 school age children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Binder EB, Bradley RG, Liu W, ''et al.'' |title=Association of FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood abuse with risk of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults |journal=JAMA |volume=299 |issue=11 |pages=1291–305 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18349090 |pmc=2441757 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.11.1291 |url=}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Genetics/GeneticTesting/dh/8824  |title=Genes May Affect Lifelong Impact of Child Abuse |author=Peggy Peck, Executive Editor |publisher=MedPage Today |date=2008-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/318/2?etoc  |title=Seeds of PTSD Planted in Childhood  |author=Constance Holden|publisher=ScienceNOW Daily News |date=2008-03-18}}</ref> However, being exposed to a traumatic experience doesn't automatically indicate they will develop PTSD.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rothschild|first=Babette|title=The Body Remembers: The psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment|year=2000|publisher=W.W.

People with PTSD have intrusive re-experiences of traumatic events which lack awareness of context and time. These episodes aggravate and maintain PTSD symptoms since the individual re-experiences trauma as if it was happening in the present moment.<ref>Ehlers, A., Hackmann, A., & Michael, T. (2004).

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
[[Evolutionary psychology]] views different types of fears and reactions caused by fears as [[adaptation]]s that may have been useful in the ancestral environment in order to avoid or cope with various threats. [[Mammal]]s generally display several defensive behaviors roughly dependent on how close the threat is: avoidance, vigilant immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defense, appeasement, and finally complete frozen immobility (the last possibly to confuse a predator's attack reflex or to simulate a dead and contaminated body). PTSD may correspond to and be caused by overactivation of such fear circuits. Thus, PTSD avoidance behaviors may correspond to mammal avoidance of and withdrawal from threats. Heightened memory of past threats may increase avoidance of similar situations in the future as well as be a prerequisite for analyzing the past threat and develop better defensive behaviors if the threat should reoccur. PTSD hyperarousal may correspond to vigilant immobility and aggressive defense. [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|Complex posttraumatic stress disorder]] (and phenomena such as the [[Stockholm syndrome]]) may in part correspond to the appeasement stage and possibly the frozen immobility stage.<ref name="Cantor2005">{{cite book|author=Chris Cantor|title=Evolution and posttraumatic stress: disorders of vigilance and defence|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yBavaOGUd_MC&pg=PR3|year= 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-58391-771-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1080/00048670701261178}}</ref>

There may be evolutionary explanations for differences in resilience to traumatic events. Thus, PTSD is rare following traumatic fire which may be explained by events such as forest fires long being part of the evolutionary history of mammals. On the other hand, PTSD is much more common following modern warfare, which may be explained by modern warfare being a new development and very unlike the quick inter-group raids that are argued to have characterized the [[paleolithic]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008}}</ref>

===Neuroendocrinology===
PTSD symptoms may result when a traumatic event causes an over-reactive adrenaline response, which creates deep neurological patterns in the brain. These patterns can persist long after the event that triggered the fear, making an individual hyper-responsive to future fearful situations.<ref name="Rothschild 2000"/><ref name="secret">[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/brain/outreach/episode4.html PBS Series "The Secret Life of the Brain Episode 4, 2001]</ref>  During traumatic experiences the high levels of stress hormones secreted suppress [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] activity which may be a major factor towards the development of PTSD.<ref name="PTSD fact and fiction">{{cite journal|last=Zohar|first=Joseph|coauthors=Alzbeta Juven-Wetzler, Viki Myers, and Leah Fostic|title=Post-Traumatic stress disorder: Facts and Fiction|journal=Current opinion in psychiatry|year=2008|volume=21|issue=1|pages=70–eoa|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f269ee}}</ref>  

PTSD causes [[biochemistry|biochemical]] changes in the brain and body that differ from other psychiatric disorders such as major depression. Individuals diagnosed with PTSD respond more strongly to a [[dexamethasone suppression test]] than individuals diagnosed with [[clinical depression]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yehuda R, Halligan SL, Golier JA, Grossman R, Bierer LM |title=Effects of trauma exposure on the cortisol response to dexamethasone administration in PTSD and major depressive disorder |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=389–404 |year=2004 |pmid=14644068 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(03)00052-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yehuda R, Halligan SL, Grossman R, Golier JA, Wong C |title=The cortisol and glucocorticoid receptor response to low dose dexamethasone administration in aging combat veterans and holocaust survivors with and without posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=393–403 |year=2002 |pmid=12242055 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01357-4}}</ref>

In addition, most people with PTSD also show a low secretion of [[cortisol]] and high secretion of [[catecholamine]]s in [[urine]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heim|first=Christine|coauthors=Ulrike Ehlert, Dirk H.

Translating this reaction to human conditions gives a pathophysiological explanation for PTSD by a maladaptive learning pathway to fear response through a hypersensitive, hyperreactive, and hyperresponsive HPA axis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yehuda R |title=Clinical relevance of biologic findings in PTSD |journal=Psychiatr Q |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=123–33 |year=2002 |pmid=12025720| doi = 10.1023/A:1015055711424}}</ref>

Low [[cortisol]] levels may predispose individuals to PTSD: Following war trauma, [[Sweden|Swedish]] soldiers serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with low pre-service salivary cortisol levels had a higher risk of reacting with PTSD symptoms, following war trauma, than soldiers with normal pre-service levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aardal-Eriksson E, Eriksson TE, Thorell LH |title=Salivary cortisol, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and general health in the acute phase and during 9-month follow-up |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=12 |pages=986–93 |year=2001 |pmid=11750895| doi = 10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01253-7}}</ref> Because cortisol is normally important in restoring [[homeostasis]] after the stress response, it is thought that trauma survivors with low cortisol experience a poorly contained—that is, longer and more distressing—response, setting the stage for PTSD. 

Other studies indicate that people that suffer from PTSD have chronically low levels of [[serotonin]] which contributes to the commonly associated behavioral symptoms such as anxiety, ruminations, irritability, aggression, suicidality, and impulsivity.<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/> Serotonin also contributes to the stabilization of glucocorticoid production.

[[Dopamine]] levels in patients with PTSD can help contribute to the symptoms associated. Low levels of dopamine can contribute to [[anhedonia]], [[apathy]], [[attention control|impaired attention]], and motor deficits. Increased levels of dopamine can cause [[psychosis]], [[agitation]], and restlessness.<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/>

Hyperresponsiveness in the norepinephrine system can be caused by continued exposure to high stress. Overactivation of norepinephrine receptors in the prefrontal cortex can be connected to the flashbacks and nightmares frequently experienced by those with PTSD. A decrease in other norepinephrine functions (awareness of the current environment) prevents the memory mechanisms in the brain from processing that the experience, and emotions the person is experiencing during a flashback are not associated with the current environment.<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/>

However, there is considerable controversy within the medical community regarding the neurobiology of PTSD. A review of existing studies on this subject showed no clear relationship between cortisol levels and PTSD. However the majority of reports indicate people with PTSD have elevated levels of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]], lower basal [[cortisol]] levels, and enhanced negative feedback suppression of the HPA axis by [[dexamethasone]].<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/><ref>{{cite journal | author =Lindley SE, Carlson EB, Benoit M |title=Basal and dexamethasone suppressed salivary cortisol concentrations in a community sample of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Biol.

Three areas of the brain whose function may be altered in PTSD have been identified: the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]], and [[hippocampus]]. Much of this research has utilised PTSD victims from the Vietnam War.

In human studies, the amygdala has been shown to be strongly involved in the formation of emotional memories, especially fear-related memories.

When someone with PTSD undergoes a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] similar to the traumatic event the body perceives the event as occurring again because the memory was never properly recorded in the patients memory.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/>

The maintenance of the fear involved with PTSD has been shown to include the HPA axis, the [[locus coeruleus]]-[[noradrenergic]] systems, and the connections between the [[limbic system]] and [[frontal cortex]]. The HPA axis which coordinates the hormonal response to stress<ref name="Radley 2011 481–497">{{cite journal|last=Radley|first=Jason J.|coauthors=Mohamed Kabbaj, Lauren Jacobson, Willem Heydendael, Rachel Yehuda, James P.

The [[locus coeruleus|LC]]-[[noradrenergic]] system has been hypothesized to mediate the over-consolidation of fear memory in PTSD. High levels of [[cortisol]] reduces noradrenergic activity it is proposed that individuals with PTSD fail to regulate the increased noradrenergic response to traumatic stress.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zohar|first=Joseph|coauthors=Alzbeta Juven-Wetzler, Vicki Myers and Leah Fostic|title=Post traumatic stress disorder:facts and fiction|journal=Current opinion in psychiatry|year=2008|volume=21|issue=1|pages=74–eoa|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f269ee}}</ref> It is thought that the intrusive memories and conditioned fear responses to associated triggers is a result of this response.

The [[basolateral amygdala|basolateral]] nucleus (BLA) of the amygdala is responsible for the comparison and development of associations between unconditioned and conditioned responses to stimuli which results in the fear conditioning present in PTSD. The BLA activates the [[central nucleus]] (CeA) which elaborates the fear response, (including behavioral response to threat and elevated startle response). Descending inhibitory inputs form the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC) regulates the transmission from the BLA to the CeA which is hypothesized to play a role in the extinction of conditioned fear responses.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/>

===Genetics===
There is evidence that susceptibility to PTSD is hereditary. Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused from genetics alone. For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin having PTSD compared to twins that were dizygotic (non-identical twins).<ref>{{cite journal |author=True WR, Rice J, Eisen SA, ''et al.'' |title=A twin study of genetic and environmental contributions to liability for posttraumatic stress symptoms |journal=Arch.

Research has also found that PTSD shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders. Panic and generalized [[anxiety disorders]] and PTSD share 60% of the same genetic variance. Alcohol, nicotine, and [[drug dependence]] shares greater than 40% genetic similarities.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/> 

[[Gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) is the major inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain. A recent study reported significant interactions between three [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in the GABA alpha-2 receptor gene and the severity of childhood trauma in predicting PTSD in adults. A study found those with a specific genotype for G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2), a protein that decreases [[G protein-coupled receptor]] signaling, and high environmental stress exposure as adults and a diagnosis of lifetime PTSD. This was particularly prevalent in adults with prior trauma exposure and low social support.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/> 

Recently, it has been found that several [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in [[FKBP5|FK506 binding protein 5]] (FKBP5) interact with childhood trauma to predict severity of adult PTSD.<ref>Newton, Phil (16 November 2008) "[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/200811/gene-anxiety-depression-and-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-fkbp5 A gene for anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder; FKBP5]" ''Psychology Today.''

This is particularly interesting given that FKBP5 SNPs have previously been associated with peritraumatic dissociation (that is, [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] at the time of the trauma),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koenen KC, Saxe G, Purcell S, ''et al.'' |title=Polymorphisms in FKBP5 are associated with peritraumatic dissociation in medically injured children |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1058–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16088328 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001727}}</ref> which has itself been shown to be predictive of PTSD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birmes P, Brunet A, Carreras D, ''et al.'' |title=The predictive power of peritraumatic dissociation and acute stress symptoms for posttraumatic stress symptoms: a three-month prospective study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1337–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12832251 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1337}}</ref><ref name="jtraumastress">{{cite journal |author=Schnurr PP, Lunney CA, Sengupta A |title=Risk factors for the development versus maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=J Trauma Stress |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=85–95 |year=2004 |pmid=15141781 |doi=10.1023/B:JOTS.0000022614.21794.f4}}</ref> Furthermore, FKBP5 may be less [[gene expression|expressed]] in those with current PTSD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yehuda R, Cai G, Golier JA, Sarapas C, Galea S, Ising M, Rein T, Schmeidler J, Müller-Myhsok B, Holsboer F, Buxbaum JD |title=Gene expression patterns associated with posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to the World Trade Center attacks |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume= 66|issue= 7|pages=708–11|date=24 April 2009 [Epub ahead of print] |pmid=19393990 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.034}}</ref> Another recent study found a single SNP in a putative [[estrogen response element]] on [[ADCYAP1R1]] (encodes pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor or PAC1) to predict PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females.<ref>{{cite journal|title =Post-traumatic stress disdorder is associated with PACAP and the PAC1 receptor|author=Ressler KJ, Merer KB, Bradley B, ''et al.''|date=February 24, 2011|journal=Nature|pmid =21350482|volume=470|issue =7335|pmc =3046811|pages=492–497|doi=10.1038/nature09856|laysummary=http://www.sciguru.com/newsitem/6364/Fear-Factor-Researchers-on-Trail-of-Marker-to-Predict-Risk-of-PTSD/|laysource=SciGuru|laydate=March 02, 2011}}</ref> Incidentally, this SNP is also associated with fear discrimination. The study suggests that perturbations in the [[PACAP]]-PAC1 pathway are involved in abnormal stress responses underlying PTSD.

PTSD is a [[psychiatric disorder]] which requires an environmental event which individuals may have varied responses to so [[gene-environment interaction|gene-environment]] studies tend to be the most indicative of their effect on the probability of PTSD then studies of the main effect of the gene. Recent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFBP5 and childhood environment to predict the severity of PTSD. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in FKBP5 have been associated with peritraumatic dissociation in mentally ill children. A study of highly traumatized African-American subjects from inner city primary care clinics indicated 4 polymorphisms of the FKBP5 gene, each of these were functional. The interaction between the polymorphisms and the severity of childhood abuse predicts the severity of the adult PTSD symptoms. A more recent study of the African-American population indicated that the TT genotype of the FKBP5 gene was associated with the highest risk of PTSD among those who experienced childhood adversity, however those with this genotype that experienced no childhood adversity had the lowest risk of PTSD. In addition [[alcohol dependence]] interacts with the FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood adversity to increase the risk of PTSD in these populations. Emergency room expression of the FKPB5 mRNA following trauma was shown to indicate a later development of PTSD.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/> 

[[Catechol-O-methyl transferase]] (COMT) is an [[enzyme]] that catalyzes the extraneuronal breakdown of [[catecholamines]]. The gene that codes for COMT has a functional polymorphism in which a [[valine]] has been replaced with a [[methionine]] at codon 158. This polymorphism has lower enzyme activity and has been tied to slower breakdown of the catecholamines. A study, of Rwandan Genocide survivors, indicated that carriers of the Val allel demonstrated the expected response relationship between the higher number of lifetime traumatic events and a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. However those who were homozygotes for the Met/Met genotype demonstrated a high risk of lifetime PTSD independent of the number of traumatic experiences. Those with Met/Met genotype also demonstrated a reduced extinction of conditioned fear responses with may account for the high risk for PTSD experienced by this genotype.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/> 

Many genes impact the limbic-frontal neurocircuitry as a result of its complexity. The main effect of the D2A1 allele of the [[dopamine receptor D2]] (DRD2) has a strong association with the diagnosis of PTSD. The D2A1 allele has also shown a significant association to PTSD in those who engaged in harmful drinking. In addition a polymorphism in the [[dopamine transporter]] SLC6A3 gene has a significant association with chronic PTSD. A polymorphism of the [[serotonin receptor]] 2A gene has been associated with PTSD in Korean women. The short allele of the promoter region of the [[serotonin transporter]] (5-HTTLPR) has been shown to be less efficient then the long allele and is associated with the [[amygdala]] response for extinction of fear conditioning. However the short allele is associated with a decreased risk of PTSD in a low risk environment but a high risk of PTSD in a high risk environment. The s/s genotype demonstrated a high risk for development of PTSD even in response to a small number of traumatic events but those with the l allele demonstrate increasing rates of PTSD with increasing traumatic experiences.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/> 

[[Genome-wide association study]] (GWAS) offer an opportunity to identify novel risk variants for PTSD which will in turn inform our understanding of the [[etiology]] of the disorder. Early results indicate the feasibility and potential power of GWAS to identify [[biomarkers]] for anxiety-related behaviors that suggest a future of PTSD. These studies will lead to the discovery of novel loci for the susceptibility and symptomatology of anxiety disorders including PTSD.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/>

===Epigenetics===
Gene and environment studies alone fail to explain the importance the developmental stressor timing exposure to the phenotypic changes associated with PTSD. [[Epigenetic]] modification is the environmentally induced change in DNA which alters the function rather than the structure of the gene. The biological mechanism of epigenetic modification typically involves the methylation of cytosine within a gene which produces decreased transcription of that segment of DNA. The [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] alteration seen in animal models parallel those of PTSD in which low basal [[cortisol]] and enhanced suppression of cortisol in response to synthetic [[glucocorticoid]] becomes [[hereditary]]. Lower levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA have been demonstrated in the [[hippocampus]] of suicide victims with histories of childhood abuse. It hasn’t been possible to monitor the state of methylation over time however the interpretation is early developmental methylation changes are long-lasting and enduring. It is hypothesized that epigenetic-mediated changes in the [[HPA axis]] could be associated with an increased vulnerability to PTSD following traumatic events. These findings support the mechanism in which early life trauma strongly validates as a risk factor for PTSD development in adulthood by recalibrating the set point and stress-responsivity of the HPA axis. Studies have reported an increased risk for PTSD and low cortisol levels in the offspring of female holocaust survivors with PTSD. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be relevant to the intrauterine environment. Mothers with PTSD produced infants with lower salivary cortisol levels only if the traumatic exposure occurred during the third trimester of gestation. These changes occur via transmission of hormonal responses to the fetus leading to a reprogramming of the glucocorticoid responsivity in the offspring.<ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"/>

Glass and Jones found early intervention to be a critical preventive measure:

<blockquote>"PTSD symptoms can follow any serious psychological trauma, such as exposure to combat, accidents, torture, disasters, criminal assault and exposure to atrocities or to the sequelae of such extraordinary events. Prisoners of war exposed to harsh treatment are particularly prone to develop PTSD. In their acute presentation these symptoms, which include subsets of a large variety of affective, cognitive, perceptional, emotional and behavioral responses which are relatively normal responses to gross psychological trauma. If persistent, however, they develop a life of their own and may be maintained by inadvertent reinforcement. Early intervention and later avoidance of positive reinforcement (which may be subtle) for such symptoms is a critical preventive measure.<ref>Psychiatry In The U.S. Army: Lessons for Community Psychiatry By Albert Julius Glass, Franklin D. Jones [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA434841]</ref></blockquote>

Studies have shown that those prepared for the potential of a traumatic experience are more prepared to deal with the stress of a traumatic experience and therefore less likely to develop PTSD.<ref name="Rothschild 2000"/>

In the Casey Family Northwest Alumni Study, conducted in conjunction with researchers from the [[Harvard Medical School]] in  Oregon and Washington state, the rate of PTSD in adults who were in [[foster care]] for one year between the ages of 14–18 was found to be higher than that of combat veterans. Up to 25% of those in the study meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD as compared to 12–13% of Iraq war veterans and 15% of Vietnam War veterans, and a rate of 4% in the general population.

==Diagnosis==
{{globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2012}}

===DSM-IV criteria===
The diagnostic criteria for PTSD, stipulated in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] IV (Text Revision)'' (DSM-IV-TR), may be summarized as:<ref name=DSM4>{{cite book |author= American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-061-0 |oclc= |doi=}}; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/ptsd.htm on-line].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/what-are-the-symptoms-of-ptsd.shtml |title=NIMH · What are the symptoms of PTSD? |work=[[National Institute of Mental Health]] |accessdate=}}</ref>

====A: Exposure to a traumatic event====
This must have involved ''both'' (a) loss of "physical integrity", or risk of serious injury or death, to self or others, and (b) a response to the event that involved intense fear, horror, or helplessness (or in children, the response must involve disorganized or agitated behavior). (The [[DSM-IV]]-TR criterion differs substantially from the previous DSM-III-R stressor criterion, which specified the traumatic event should be of a type that would cause "significant symptoms of distress in almost anyone," and that the event was "outside the range of usual human experience."<ref>{{Cite book | last = American Psychiatric Association  | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-III-R  | publisher =  | year = 1987  | isbn = 0-89042-018-1}}</ref>)

====B: Persistent re-experiencing====
One or more of these must be present in the victim: [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]] memories, recurring distressing dreams, subjective re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s), or intense negative psychological or physiological response to any objective or subjective reminder of the traumatic event(s).

====C: Persistent avoidance and emotional numbing====
This involves a sufficient level of:
* avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, such as certain thoughts or feelings, or talking about the event(s);
* avoidance of behaviors, places, or people that might lead to distressing memories as well as the disturbing memories, dreams, flashbacks, and intense psychological or physiological distress;<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/>
* inability to recall major parts of the trauma(s), or decreased involvement in significant life activities;
* decreased capacity (down to complete inability) to feel certain feelings;
* an expectation that one's future will be somehow constrained in ways not normal to other people.

====D: Persistent symptoms of increased arousal not present before====
These are all physiological response issues, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, or problems with anger, concentration, or [[hypervigilance]]. Additional symptoms include irritability, angry outbursts, increased startle response, and concentration or sleep problems.<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/>

====E: Duration of symptoms for more than 1 month====
If all other criteria are present, but 30 days have not elapsed, the individual is diagnosed with [[Acute stress disorder]].<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/>

====F: Significant impairment====
The symptoms reported must lead to "clinically significant distress or impairment" of major domains of life activity, such as social relations, occupational activities, or other "important areas of functioning".<ref>{{Cite book| last =American Psychiatric Association| title =Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, quick reference| publisher =American Psychiatric Association| year =1994| location =Washington, D.C.| page =211| isbn =0-89042-063-7 }}

* Criterion A (prior exposure to traumatic events) is more specifically stated, and evaluation of an individual's emotional response at the time (current criterion A2) is dropped.
* Several items in Criterion B (intrusion symptoms) are rewritten to add or augment certain distinctions now considered important.
* Special consideration is given to developmentally appropriate criteria for use with children and adolescents. This is especially evident in the restated Criterion B—intrusion symptoms. Development of age-specific criteria for diagnosis of PTSD is ongoing at this time.
* Criterion C (avoidance and numbing) has been split into "C" and "D":
** Criterion C (new version) now focuses solely on avoidance of behaviors or physical or temporal reminders of the traumatic experience(s). What were formerly two symptoms are now three, due to slight changes in descriptions.
** New Criterion D focuses on negative alterations in cognition and mood associated with the traumatic event(s) and contains two new symptoms, one expanded symptom, and four largely unchanged symptoms specified in the previous criteria.
* Criterion E (formerly "D"), which focuses on increased arousal and reactivity, contains one modestly revised, one entirely new, and four unchanged symptoms.
* Criterion F (formerly "E") still requires duration of symptoms to have been at least one month.
* Criterion G (formerly "F") stipulates symptom impact ("disturbance") in the same way as before.
* The "acute" vs "delayed" distinction is dropped; the "delayed" specifier is considered appropriate if clinical symptom onset is no sooner than 6 months after the traumatic event(s).

"Developmental trauma disorder", a proposed new diagnosis, was still under discussion at the time of the draft publication.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Conditions Proposed by Outside Sources | work =  | url = http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/ConditionsProposedbyOutsideSources.aspx | accessdate = 11 February 2010}}</ref>{{update after |2013 |05 |30 |reason=diagnosis will have been adopted or dropped by then|date=November 2010}}

===Prevention and early intervention strategies===
{{See also|Traumatic memories}}
Modest benefits have been seen from early access to [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], as well as from some medications such as [[propranolol]].<ref name="Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ 2007 80–116">{{cite journal |author=Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ |title=A critical analysis of approaches to targeted PTSD prevention: current status and theoretically derived future directions |journal=Behav Modif |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=80–116 |year=2007 |pmid=17179532 |doi=10.1177/0145445506295057}}</ref> [[Critical incident stress management]] has been suggested as a means of preventing PTSD, but subsequent studies suggest the likelihood of its producing [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Disaster-related post-traumatic stress in police officers: A field study of the impact of debriefing | journal = Stress Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 143–8 | last = Carlier | first = IVE | coauthors = Lamberts RD; van Uchelen AJ; Gersons BPR | year = 1998 | url = http://doi.apa.org/?uid=1998-10258-001 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1700(199807)14:3<143::AID-SMI770>3.0.CO;2-S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayou RA, Ehlers A, Hobbs M |title=Psychological debriefing for road traffic accident victims.

====Early detection====
The ability to prescreen individuals would be of great help in getting treatment to those who are at risk of PTSD prior to development of the syndrome.  Several biological indicators have been identified that are related to later PTSD development.  First,  Delhanty<ref name="Delahanty DL 2011">{{cite journal |author= Delahanty DL |title= Toward the predeployment detection of risk for PTSD |journal= American Psychiatric Assn | year=2011 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10101519 |volume= 168 |pages= 9 }}</ref> found that higher response times and a smaller [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] volume were identified as linked to later PTSD development.  However, both of these indicators are relatively difficult to test for and need specialized tests or equipment, or both, to identify.  A blood biomarker is much easier to test for.  Van Zuiden et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author= van Zuiden M, Geuze E, Maas M, Vermetten E, Heijnen CJ, Kavelaars|title= Deployment-related severe fatigue with depressive symptoms is associated with increased [[glucocorticoid]] binding to peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells |journal= Brain Behav Immun |volume=23 | pages=1132–1139 |doi= 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.07.004 |pmid= 19635550 |year= 2009 |issue= 8}}</ref> found a biomarker when testing U.S. Army soldiers prior to deployment.  They found that soldiers with more glucocorticoid receptors (GR) were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD six months after deployment.  However, higher GR levels have not been identified as a cause of PTSD, and may instead be an intermediator, or even an indicator that the individual has previously experienced traumatic events.  There is a great deal of overlap between high GR levels and those who later are diagnosed with and without PTSD.  Thus, the identification of high GR is simply a vulnerability indicator at this time. 

Delhanty<ref name="Delahanty DL 2011"/>  found that biological precursors existed directly following traumatic exposure in those who later developed chronic PTSD and were significantly different from those who did not.  Directly following the traumatic event later sufferers often have significantly lower levels of [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] pituitary-adrenal activity and a corresponding decrease in Cortisol.  
Other methods of early detection include the identification of specific risk factors associated with later PTSD symptoms.  Resnick, Acierno, Holmes, Kilpatrick, and Jager<ref name="Resnik H, Acierno R, Kilpatrick DG, Jager, N 1999 359–370">{{cite journal |author=Resnik H, Acierno R, Kilpatrick DG, Jager, N |title= Prevention of post-rape psychopathology: Preliminary findings of a controlled acute rape treatment study|journal=Journal of anxiety disorders|volume=13 |pages=359–370 |year=1999 |pmid=10504107 |issue=4 }}</ref> for example were able to identify that the forensic exam given to victims after a rape was associated with PTSD.  
Finally, global treatments attempt to avoid the problems of early detection by simply treating everyone involved. However, many studies<ref name="Delahanty DL 2011"/> have found this to be often ineffective and for global treatments to at times increase prevalence rates of PTSD.

====Preventive Treatments====

=====Psychological debriefing=====
The first form of preventive treatment is that of a psychological debriefing.<ref name="Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ 2007 80–116"/>  Psychological debriefing is the most often used preventive measure.  One of the main reasons for this is the relative ease with which this treatment can be given to individuals directly following an event.  It consists of interviews that are meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event.
However, while this form of therapy is the most often used it is the least effective.<ref name="Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ 2007 80–116"/>  Studies have had mixed findings concerning psychological debriefings and have ranged from being of significant help to helping in the formation of PTSD in individuals who would otherwise have not developed PTSD.<ref name="Radley 2011 481–497"/> The greater number of studies tends to simply find that it is neither overly beneficial nor harmful.<ref name="Rothschild 2000"/>

=====Risk Targeted Interventions=====
Risk targeted interventions are those that attempt to mitigate specific formative information or events. It can target modeling normal behaviors, instruction on a task, or giving information on the event. For example,<ref name="Resnik H, Acierno R, Kilpatrick DG, Jager, N 1999 359–370"/> rape victims were given an instruction video on the procedures for a forensic exam. Also included in the video was advice on how to identify and stop avoidance behavior and control anxiety. Finally, the individuals modeling the forensic exam were shown to be calm and relaxed. PTSD diagnosis for those who saw the video were thirty three percent less than for those who went through the standard forensic procedure.

=====Psychobiological Treatments=====
Psychobiological treatments have also found success, especially with cortisol.<ref name="Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ 2007 80–116"/> Psychobiological treatments target biological changes that occur after a traumatic event. They also attempt to chemically alter learning or memory formation.  Cortisol treatments after a traumatic event have found success in mitigating later diagnosis of PTSD. As discussed earlier, cortisol is often lower in individuals who are at risk of PTSD after a traumatic event than their counterparts. By increasing cortisol levels to normal levels this has been shown to reduce arousal post event as well prevent GR upregulation.

=====Stepped Collaborative Care=====
Stepped collaborative care is where individuals who are at risk are monitored for symptoms.<ref name="Feldner MT, Monson CM, Friedman MJ 2007 80–116"/> As symptoms of PTSD appear the level of care is increased to treat those symptoms.

===Psychotherapeutic interventions===
Many forms of psychotherapy have been advocated for trauma-related problems such as PTSD. Basic counseling practices common to many treatment responses for PTSD include education about the condition and provision of safety and support.<ref name="Rothschild 2000"/><ref>Foa 1997.</ref>

The psychotherapy programs with the strongest demonstrated efficacy include cognitive behavioral programs, variants of [[exposure therapy]], stress inoculation training (SIT), variants of cognitive therapy (CT), [[eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing|eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR),<ref name="Newport 2010 211–218"/> and many combinations of these procedures.<ref>Cahill, S.

EMDR and trauma-focused [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (TFCBT) were recommended as first-line treatments for trauma victims in a 2007 review; however, "the evidence base [for EMDR] was not as strong as that for TFCBT ...

====Behavioral and Cognitive Behavioral therapy====
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) seeks to change the way a trauma victim feels and acts by changing the patterns of thinking or behavior, or both, responsible for negative emotions. CBT has been proven to be an effective treatment for PTSD and is currently considered the standard of care for PTSD by the [[United States Department of Defense]].<ref>Hassija, C.M. & Gray, M.J. (2007). Behavioral Interventions for Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 3(2),''166-175. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]</ref> In CBT, individuals learn to identify thoughts that make them feel afraid or upset and replace them with less distressing thoughts. The goal is to understand how certain thoughts about events cause PTSD-related stress.

Recent research on contextually based third-generation [[behavior therapy|behavior therapies]] suggests that they may produce results comparable to some of the better validated therapies.<ref>Mulick, P.S., Landes, S. & Kanter, J.W. (2005) Contextual Behavior Therapies in the Treatment of PTSD: A Review. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 1(3),'' 223-228 [http://www.uwm.edu/~jkanter/pdf/publication/IJBCT-1-3.pdf]</ref> Many of these therapy methods have a significant element of exposure<ref>Hassija, C.M. & Gray, M.J.

Exposure therapy is a type of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]<ref>{{Cite web | last =Grohol | first =JM | title =What is Exposure Therapy?| url =http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/what-is-exposure-therapy/ | accessdate = 2010-07-14}}</ref> that involves assisting trauma survivors to re-experience distressing trauma-related memories and reminders in order to facilitate habituation and successful emotional processing of the trauma memory. Most exposure therapy programs include both imaginal confrontation with the traumatic memories and real-life exposure to trauma reminders; this therapy modality is well supported by clinical evidence.

Some studies have shown that treatment with [[hydrocortisone]] shortly after a traumatic event, in comparison to a placebo, decreases the likelihood that the patient will suffer from PTSD. Other studies have indicated that [[propranolol]] administered within 6 hours of a traumatic event decreases the physiological reactivity to a reminder of the traumatic event. However propranolol had no effect on the rate of PTSD. Despite these studies there is not significant evidence that medication can prevent PTSD, therefore none is routinely administered.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bisson|first=Jonathan I|title=Pharmacological treatment to prevent and treat post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=Torture|year=2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=104–eoa}}</ref>

====Symptom prevention: potentially useful medication classes====
Some medications have shown benefit in preventing PTSD or reducing its incidence, when given in close proximity to a traumatic event. These medications include:

'''[[Alpha-adrenergic agonist]]s.'''

'''[[Beta blockers]].''' [[Propranolol]] ("Inderal"), similarly to clonidine, may be useful if there are significant symptoms of "over-arousal". These may inhibit the formation of traumatic memories by blocking adrenaline's effects on the [[amygdala]].<ref name="pmid11822998">{{cite journal |author=Pitman RK, Sanders KM, Zusman RM, ''et al.'' |title=Pilot study of secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder with propranolol |journal=Biol.

'''[[Glucocorticoid]]s.''' There is some evidence suggesting that administering [[glucocorticoid]]s immediately after a traumatic experience may help prevent PTSD.

===United States===

The [http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ National Comorbidity Survey] has estimated that the [[lifetime prevalence]] of PTSD among adult Americans is 7.8%, with women (10.4%) twice as likely as men<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/>  (5%) to have PTSD at some point in their lives.<ref name=Kessler95/> More than 60% of men and more than 60% of women experience at least one traumatic event in their life. The most frequently reported traumatic events by men are rape, combat, and childhood neglect or physical abuse. Women most frequently report instances of rape, sexual molestation, physical attack, being threatened with a weapon and childhood physical abuse.<ref name="Olszewski 2005 40"/> 88% of men and 79% of women with lifetime PTSD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. Major depressive disorder, 48% of men and 49% of women, and lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence, 51.9% of men and 27.9% of women, are the most common comorbid disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sher|first=Leo|title=Neurobiology of suicidal behavior in post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=Expert Reviews|year=2010|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1233–1235}}</ref> 

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] estimates that 830,000 Vietnam War veterans suffered symptoms of PTSD.<ref>Mintz, S.  (2007) [http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 The War's Costs]. ''Digital History''.</ref>  The ''National Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Study'' (NVVRS) found 15.2% of male and 8.5% of female Vietnam Vets to suffer from current PTSD at the time of the study. Life-Time prevalence of PTSD was 30.9% for males and 26.9% for females. In a reanalysis of the NVVRS data, along with analysis of the data from the Matsunaga Vietnam Veterans Project, Schnurr, Lunney, Sengupta, and Waelde found that, contrary to the initial analysis of the NVVRS data, a large majority of Vietnam veterans suffered from PTSD symptoms (but not the disorder itself). Four out of five reported recent symptoms when interviewed 20–25 years after Vietnam.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

A 2011 study from [[Georgia State University]] and [[San Diego State University]] found that rates of PTSD diagnosis increased significantly when troops were stationed in combat zones, had tours of longer than a year, experienced combat, or were injured. Military personnel serving in combat zones were 12.1 percentage points more likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis than their active-duty counterparts in non-combat zones. Those serving more than 12 months in a combat zone were 14.3 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD than those who served less than one year.  Experiencing an enemy firefight was associated a 18.3 percentage point increase in the probability of PTSD, while being wounded or injured in combat was associated a 23.9 percentage point increase in the likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis. For the 2.16 million U.S. troops deployed in combat zones between 2001 and 2010, the total estimated two-year costs of treatment for combat-related PTSD are between $1.54 billion and $2.69 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/psychological-costs-war-military-combat-mental-health/|title=Psychological Costs of War: Military Combat and Mental Health|publisher=journalistsresource.org }}</ref>

==History==

===Earliest reports===

Psychiatrist [[Jonathan Shay]] has proposed that [[Lady Percy]]'s [[soliloquy]] in [[Henry IV, Part 1]] (act 2, [http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=henry4p1&Act=2&Scene=3&Scope=scene scene 3, lines 40-62]), written around 1597, represents an unusually accurate description of the symptom constellation of PTSD.<ref>Shay, Jonathan ''Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character,'' Scribner, 1994; pp. 165-66.</ref>

===Modern recognition in military settings===
[[File:Statue Three Servicemen Vietnam Veterans Memorial-editA.png|thumb|right|250px|Statue, ''Three Servicemen'', Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]
In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with "exhaustion" after the stress of battle. This "exhaustion" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma—prior to the 20th century, soldiers were expected always to be emotionally tough and show no fear in the midst of combat. The only treatment for this "exhaustion" was to relieve the afflicted from frontline duty until symptoms subsided, then return to battle. During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.<ref>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.ptsdmanual.com/chap1.htm|title=Military Veterans PTSD Reference Manual|chapter=Ch. 1, Section II. HISTORY|pages=01–03|author=MSG. I. S. Parrish, USA Retired|publisher=Infinity Publishing|location=Bryn Mawr, PA|edition=Revised|month=May|year=2008|accessdate=11 January 2011|isbn=0-7414-0077-4}}</ref>

According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, "One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees."<ref>[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 - 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker</ref>

Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many [[military conflict]]s since, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]].<ref name=AllInTheMind>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/allinthemind/stories/2004/1214098.htm When trauma tips you over: PTSD Part 1] All in the Mind, Australian Broadcasting Commission, 9 October 2004.</ref>

Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include [[railway spine]], [[stress syndrome]], [[shell shock]], battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.<ref>{{cite book |title=Brave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genome |last=Andreasen |first=Nancy C.

===Terminology===
The term ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'') was coined in the mid 1970s,<ref name=AllInTheMind/> in part through the efforts of anti–Vietnam War activists and the anti-war group [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] and [[Chaim F. Shatan]], who worked with them and coined the term ''post-Vietnam Syndrome''; the condition was added to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-III (1980)|DSM-III]] as ''posttraumatic stress disorder''.<ref name=IHHRT>{{cite book |author=Shalev, Arieh Y.; Yehuda, Rachel; Alexander C. McFarlane|title=International handbook of human response to trauma |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press |location=New York |year=2000|pages= |isbn=0-306-46095-5 |oclc= |doi=}}; [http://www.istss.org/what/history2.cfm on-line].</ref>

Early in 1978, the term was used in a working group finding presented to the Committee of Reactive Disorders.<ref name=IHHRT/> The term was formally recognized in 1980.<ref name=AllInTheMind/>

In the [[DSM-IV]], the spelling "<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS ARTICLE. The spelling/hyphenation of "posttraumatic" is correct per DSM-IV-TR -->post<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS ARTICLE. The spelling/hyphenation of "posttraumatic" is correct per DSM-IV-TR -->traumatic<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS ARTICLE. The spelling/hyphenation of "posttraumatic" is correct per DSM-IV-TR --> stress disorder" is used, while in the [[ICD-10]] the spelling is "post-traumatic stress disorder".<ref name = icd10-2007>{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder#Terminology | title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision Version for 2007 | publisher=World Health Organization (UN) | year=2007 | accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> Elsewhere, especially in less formal writing, the term may be rendered as two words—"post traumatic stress disorder".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}})
