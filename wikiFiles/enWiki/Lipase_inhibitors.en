'''Lipase inhibitors''' are drugs used to reduce the activity of [[lipase]]s found in the [[intestine]]. Lipases are secreted by the [[pancreas]] when fat is present. The primary role of lipase inhibitors is to decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of fats. Fats then tend to be excreted in feces rather than being absorbed to be used as a source of caloric energy, and this can result in [[weight loss]] in individuals.<ref name=A>{{cite web|last=Aronne|first=Louis|title=Treating Obesity:Drug Treatment for Obesity|url=http://www.medscape.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/viewarticle/407755_7|work=Treating Obesity|publisher=Medscape News|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> These inhibitors could be used for the treatment of [[obesity]], which can subsequently lead to [[Type II diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]s if not managed. An example of a lipase inhibitor is [[orlistat]].<ref name=B>{{cite journal|last=Franson|first=K.|coauthors=Rossner|title=Fat intake and food choices during weight reduction with diet, behavioural modification and a lipase inhibitor|journal=Journal of Internal Medicine|year=2000|volume=247|issue=5|pages=607–614|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2240cea9-9618-445e-af62-c3f20fb34891%40sessionmgr111&vid=8&hid=109|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref>

Lipase inhibitors can be found naturally in plants and can be clinically modified to drugs. Some include Panax japonicas and  Platycodi radix. These plants include phytochemicals such as [[saponin]]s, [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, and [[caffeine]].<ref name=D />

==Mechanism==

Lipase inhibitors may affect the amount of fat absorbed, yet they do not block the absorption of a particular type of fat.<ref name=A /> Likewise, lipase inhibitors are not absorbed into the [[bloodstream]]. Lipase inhibitors bind to lipase enzymes in the intestine,<ref name=B /> thus preventing the [[hydrolysis]] of dietary triglycerides into [[monoglyceride]]s and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref name=D>{{cite journal|last=Yun|first=W.|title=Possible Anti-Obesity therapeutics from nature – A review|journal=Phytochemistry|year=2010|volume=71|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942210002967|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> This then reduces the absorption of dietary fat.<ref name=B /> Lipase inhibitors covalently bond to the active [[serine]] site on lipases. This [[covalent bond]] is strong, meaning the lipase inhibitor tends to remain attached to the lipase.<ref name=C>{{cite book|last=Christopher|first=A.|title=Fat Digestion and Absorption|year=2000|publisher=AOCS|location=Champaign, IL,usa|pages=425–430|url=http://books.google.ca/books?ei=5-xrT7mIMeaniAKe9biFBQ&id=t5FNYzGEUDsC&dq=Drent+M%2C+van+der+Veen+EA.+Lipase+inhibition%3A+A+novel+concept+in+the+treatment+of+obesity.+Int+J+Obes.+1993%3B17%3A241-244.&q=%22lipase+inhibitor%22#v=snippet&q=%22lipase%20inhibitor%22&f=false}}</ref>  Studies have shown that lipase inhibitors work optimally when 40% of an individual’s daily caloric intake is obtained from fat.<ref name=A />{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=Really? Or is 40% a maximum?}} Orlistat tends to block absorption of 30% of total fat intake from a meal, as orlistat passes out of the digestive tract more rapidly than fat does.<ref name=B />

==Side effects==

Lipase inhibitors can cause [[side effect]]s, including oily spotting, fecal inconsistence{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=Is this supposed to be incontinence?}}, [[flatus]] with discharge<ref name=A />  and [[Abdominal cramps|abdominal cramping]].<ref name=D /> Additionally, a raise in [[blood pressure]], [[dry mouth]], [[constipation]], [[headache]], and [[insomnia]] have been reported.<ref name=D />  Malabsorption of fat soluble [[vitamin]]s may develop as a result of the impaired absorption of fat, which is required for the transportation of these vitamins across the intestine to reach the blood.<ref name=C /> Since lipase inhibitors are not absorbed in the intestine, and consequently not circulating in the blood, information about alternative side effects such as the modulation{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=what is this supposed to mean in this context?}} of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is unobtainable.<ref name=A /> Generally, side effects can be controlled by reducing the consumption of dietary fats. Overall, orlistat has been considered to be safer than other anti-obesity drugs.<ref name=B />
