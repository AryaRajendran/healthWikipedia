Also known as "Parathyroid gland removal", '''Parathyroidectomy''' is the [[surgery|surgical]] removal of one or more [[parathyroid gland]]s. This procedure is used to remove primary tumors or hyperplasia of the glands, especially when they produce excessive [[parathyroid hormone]]. As drugs such as Fosamax do not treat the underlying cause of parathyroid-related [[osteoporosis]], surgery is the only cure.  Bone loss is reversible.

The location of the glands is generally behind the [[thyroid]], but there is a lot of variation. Usually, the location of an enlarged gland has been confirmed via a [[sestamibi scan]] or on [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].

==Procedure==
During the [[Surgery|operation]], the patient is usually put under a [[general anesthetic]] (unconscious and pain free) or a [[local anesthetic]] (pain free). The [[surgeon]] makes an incision around an inch long in the neck just under the [[Adam's apple]] and locates the offending parathyroid glands. Preoperative testing using [[sestamibi]] scanning can help identify the location of glands. It can also be used to limit the extent of surgical exploration when used in conjunction with intraoperative PTH hormone monitoring.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Augustine|first=MM|coauthors=Bravo, PE, Zeiger, MA|title=Surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism.|journal=Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists|date=2011 Mar-Apr|volume=17 Suppl 1|pages=75–82|pmid=21324817}}</ref>  The particular problem or disease process will determine how many of the parathyroid glands are removed. Some parathyroid tissue must be left in place to help prevent [[hypoparathyroidism]].

The [[patient]] usually recovers very quickly after the operation.  The [[Parathyroid hormone|PTH]] level is back to normal within 10–15 minutes, and is confirmed by intraoperative rapid assessment during the operation.  However, the remaining parathyroid glands may take hours to several weeks to return to their normal functioning levels.  Patients must be placed on calcium supplements to prevent symptoms of [[hypocalcemia]] and to restore lost bone mass.
