The '''pulmonary artery''' carries deoxygenated [[blood]] from the [[heart]] to the [[lungs]]. It is one of the only [[artery|arteries]] (other than the [[Umbilical artery|umbilical arteries]] in the fetus) that carry deoxygenated blood.

In the [[human heart]], the '''pulmonary trunk''' ('''pulmonary artery''' or '''main pulmonary artery''') begins at the base of the [[right ventricle]]. It is short and wideâ€”approximately {{convert|5|cm|in}} in length and {{convert|3|cm|in}} in diameter. It then branches into two pulmonary arteries (left and right), which deliver de-oxygenated blood to the corresponding [[lung]].

In contrast to the ''pulmonary arteries'', the [[bronchial arteries]] supply nutrition to the lungs themselves.

== Role in disease ==
[[Pulmonary hypertension]] occurs alone and as a consequence of a number of [[pulmonology|lung diseases]]. It can also be a consequence of [[heart disease]] ([[Eisenmenger's syndrome]]) but equally a cause (right-ventricular [[heart failure]]); it also occurs as a consequence of [[pulmonary embolism]] and [[scleroderma]]. It is characterised by reduced exercise tolerance. Severe forms, generally, have a dismal prognosis.
