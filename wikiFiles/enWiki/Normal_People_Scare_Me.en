'''''Normal People Scare Me: A Film about Autism''''' is a [[documentary film]] about [[autism]], produced by [[Joey Travolta]], older brother of actor [[John Travolta]].<ref name="mccarthy" /> The documentary initially began as a 10-minute [[short film]] co-directed by an autistic teenager named Taylor Cross, and his mother Keri Bowers. Joey Travolta first met Cross at a program Travolta led teaching the art of filmmaking to children with special needs. He helped educate Cross about filmmaking, and the documentary was expanded into a [[feature-length film]]. It includes interviews with 65 people, including those that are autistic as well as friends and family. Cross asks them about their experiences with autism and how they feel about it, and elicits multiple insightful responses from his subjects.

The short version of the film was shown at a student film festival at [[Chaminade College Preparatory School (California)|Chaminade High School]] in [[West Hills, Los Angeles, California|West Hills]], California in April 2004, and co-director Cross won multiple awards at the festival. In November 2004, Cross was honored for his work on the film, at a gala benefit dinner for the Bubel-Aiken Foundation in [[Los Angeles, California]]; the foundation's co-creator is [[Clay Aiken]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. The feature-length version of the film was released on April 1, 2006. Special screenings included the [[Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival]] in October 2006, and the Staten Island Film Festival in 2007. The documentary received positive reception in the ''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]'', ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the ''[[Tri-Valley Herald]]''.

==Contents==
The documentary's purpose is to educate the public to gain an understanding of autism.<ref name="buchanan" /> Taylor Cross interviews autistic children between the ages of 9 to 19, and asks them to describe their perspective on the world and to share their thoughts.<ref name="mccarthy" /> The youngest autistic child to appear in the film is a boy named Ricky, and the oldest at age 19 shares the same name as the co-director, Taylor.<ref name="mccarthy" /> An autistic boy named Brian appears in the film and voices frustration due to experiencing teasing from girls at his school.<ref name="mccarthy" /> Brian's sister Elizabeth also appears in the film – she communicates with her brother in a language only the two of them comprehend.<ref name="mccarthy" /> Cross also interviews parents of children with autism, including surfer [[Izzy Paskowitz]].<ref name="woodman" /> In addition, Cross interviews the dean of the film program at [[New York University]].<ref name="woodman" />

Cross asks subjects in the film: "Do you like having autism?".<ref name="skenazy" /> One middle school girl responds "I feel okay. It makes things hard for me that might be easy for others."<ref name="skenazy" /> A little boy tells Cross: "Everyone's good at their own things."<ref name="skenazy" /> An autistic woman tells Cross "Yes, I do. Because why should I not--why should I feel bad about something I can't really change? I might as well look at the good things about it."<ref name="brown">{{cite news   | last =Brown  | first =Campbell  | title =Taylor Cross and Keri Bowers, "Normal People Scare Me", discuss autism and the documentary they co-directed  | work =Sunday Today  | publisher =[[NBC News]]  | date =April 23, 2006 }}</ref> Another boy says to Cross "I don't like being autistic", and when Cross asks why, the boy responds: "Because it's hard for me to have changes and all the other stuff."<ref name="brown" /> A woman states to Cross of her experiences with autism: "I cry, I scream, I wish to God I wasn't different and I didn't have to struggle with everything...", and a boy tells him of the negative aspects of the condition: "The bad thing about autism is that it gets hard to understand other people and to understand what people say and what--what other people try to tell me to do and how to explain me better."<ref name="brown" />

When Cross asks his subjects "Tell me how you feel about having autism", he elicits responses including: "I have first thought, because people don't understand me", "Over the years I have come to accept it as a part of who I am. When I was younger I wanted to go away" and "It is not the biggest part of my life but knowing that I have something that makes me a little different, it sometimes makes me question myself".<ref name="harris">{{cite news   | last =Harris  | first =Tony  | coauthors =Fredricka Whitfield, Susan Candiotti, Allan Chernoff, Dan Lothian, Judy Fortin, Drew Griffin, Susan Lisovicz  | title =Bomb in Baggage in Orlando; Flight Safety Inspections; Ruling Change in Zimbabwe  | work =CNN Newswroom  | publisher =[[CNN]]  | date =April 2, 2008  }}</ref>

He also poses a question to the interviewees related to the film's title, and asks "Sometimes normal people are scary to kids with autism. They talk funny or too fast. Do normal people ever scare you?"<ref name="harris" /> Responses include "All the time", "Yes, because it is hard to keep up when people are talking", "Not really", "Yes. They do" and "A little, yes".<ref name="harris" /> Cross poses the question to those with autism: "What is normal anyway?".<ref name="freefilm">{{cite news   | last = Moellering  | first = Amy   | title = Free film festival focuses on siblings of children with special needs   | newspaper = [[Tri-Valley Herald]]  | publisher = [[MediaNews Group]]  | date = September 24, 2008}}</ref> Cross interviews autistic students in the film and asks them to cite the most difficult things about their condition.<ref name="gonzalez" /> Answers include "making friends", "driving", and "making people not hate you".<ref name="gonzalez" /> All students acknowledge to Cross in the interviews that they have been teased for being different from others.<ref name="gonzalez" />

The idea for the name of the film came to Cross from a t-shirt at a novelty store that had the phrase "Normal People Scare Me" printed on it.<ref name="gonzalez">{{cite news  | last =Gonzalez | first =Maria  | title =Autistic teen's film wins recognition | work =Ventura County Star | page =1 | date =May 24, 2004  }}</ref> "I thought it was absolutely perfect," said Cross of the phrase he saw on the t-shirt.<ref name="gonzalez" /> In an appearance on ''[[Sunday Today]]'', Cross explained to [[Campbell Brown]]: "Yeah, I was thinking I--it actually just came off a T-shirt that I read, which totally makes sense either way because the real underlying message, if--if you've noticed it, even I haven't noticed it until like recently, like the whole underlying message is `What is normal anyway?' I mean, that just kind of gives it off in the title."<ref name="brown" />
