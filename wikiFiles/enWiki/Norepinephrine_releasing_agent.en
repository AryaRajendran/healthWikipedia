A '''norepinephrine releasing agent''' ('''NRA''') is a type of [[drug]] which induces the [[synapse|release]] of [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]] from the [[synapse|pre-synaptic neuron]] into the [[synapse]]. This in turn leads to increased [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of norepinephrine and epinephrine therefore an increase in [[adrenergic]] [[neurotransmission]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Keith Parker; Laurence Brunton; Goodman, Louis Sanford; Lazo, John S.; Gilman, Alfred | title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics | edition=11 | issue= | page = | pages= | chapter = | publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York | year=2006 | id = ISBN 0-07-142280-3 | doi= | url=http://books.mcgraw-hill.com/medical/goodmanandgilman/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author= |editor=Thomas L.

{{Main|Releasing agent}}

== Uses ==
NRAs are used for a variety of clinical indications including the following:

* For the treatment of [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) - e.g., [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], [[pemoline]].
* As [[anorectic]]s in the treatment of [[obesity]] - e.g., amphetamine, [[phentermine]], [[benzphetamine]], [[phenmetrazine]], [[aminorex]].
* As [[wakefulness-promoting agent]]s in the treatment of [[narcolepsy]] - e.g., amphetamine, methamphetamine.
* As [[nasal decongestant]]s - e.g., [[levomethamphetamine]], [[propylhexedrine]], [[ephedrine]], [[pseudoephedrine]], [[phenylpropanolamine]].

They are also used as [[recreational drug]]s, though this is typically reserved only for those that also induce the release of serotonin and/or dopamine like amphetamine, methamphetamine, [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]], [[mephedrone]], and [[4-methylaminorex]], among others.

[[Cathine]] and [[cathinone]] are NRAs found [[natural product|naturally]] in ''[[Catha edulis]]''. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are also found naturally in ''[[Ephedra sinica]]''. Both of these plants are used medicinally (and recreationally as well regarding the former). The endogenous [[trace amine]]s [[phenethylamine]] and [[tyramine]] are NRAs found in many animals, including humans.
