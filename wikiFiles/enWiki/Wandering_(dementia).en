'''Wandering''', in persons with [[dementia]], is a common behavior that can cause great risk for the person, and is often the major priority (and concern) for caregivers.  It is estimated to be the most common form disruption from people with dementia within institutions.<ref>{{cite book

== Elopement ==
Unattended wandering that goes out of bounds, a behavior known as '''elopement''', is a special concern for caregivers and [[search and rescue]] responders. Wandering (especially if combined with [[Sundowning (dementia)|sundowning]]) can result in the person's being lost out of doors at night, dressed inappropriately, and unable to take many ordinarily routine steps to ensure his or her personal safety and security.  This is a situation of great urgency, and the necessity of searching at night imposes added risks on the searchers.

In some countries the social costs of elopement, already significant, are increasing rapidly.<ref name="dbs-sar">{{cite web

== Assessment ==
Assessment of a person's risk of wandering often is neglected.  A review of medical records of 83 persons with dementia resident in [[Los Angeles, California]], found that only 8% of the records included a wandering risk assessment.<ref name="pmid15352531">{{cite journal

==Wandering prevention==

The most common form of wandering prevention is for a caregiver to remain in the company of the person likely to wander, so the caregiver can either accompany them or prevent them from wandering when the situation occurs.

Other methods used to prevent wandering, or simply to reduce the risk of wandering out of bounds, include:  drugs, physical restraints, physical barriers, 24-hour real-time surveillance, and tracking devices.  All of these methods have ethical issues and one, use of physical restraints, is widely considered to be inhumane.<ref>{{cite journal

Much of the literature on wandering concerns persons resident in institutions.  Studies on wandering from private residences are insufficient for comparison of prevention via drugs versus other methods.<ref>{{cite journal

The risk of wandering can be reduced by several low-tech and minimally intrusive techniques, including:  placing a visual barrier such as a curtain across a doorway.<ref name="pmid15154224">{{cite journal

Wandering can be due to a person searching for stimulation. If a wanderer does not purposefully attempt to escape the location where they are, a minimal barrier can deter wandering behaviour. However, some wanderers will look for a familiar route from their past, while others will simply 'explore.'

Some cases of wanderers operating vehicles and driving either aimlessly or along a familiar route have been reported.

In response to wandering seniors, 25 states have adopted [[Silver Alert]] programs. [[Silver Alert]] is a program similar to [[AMBER Alert]] to notify the public of missing seniors with dementia and other cognitive disabilities.

== Technology ==
In other efforts to help keep residents safe, mitigate liability, and protect reputations, Long Term Care and Assisted Living Facilities may use radio frequency ([[RFID]]) products to protect their residents.  A resident wears a wrist, pendant, or ankle transmitter.  This RFID tag can be read by receiving antenna units, which are placed usually at door or hallway locations that are deemed likely routes of egress and need monitoring.  The system will then either sound an alarm or briefly lock a door <ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3830/is_4_52/ai_100204753/pg_2/?tag=content;col1 | work=Nursing Homes | title=Why residents wanderand what you can do about it - Feature Article - Interview | year=2003}}</ref> when a door monitor reads a transmitter worn by a resident that is at risk for wandering. This helps prevent an elopement as staff can be notified by alarms at the door, pocket pagers, and email.  A caregiver will be able to quickly find the person at risk and keep them safely inside.  Smaller scale versions of this technology are also used in private residences.<ref>http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw28/leikas.html</ref>

Newer versions of this equipment have become more advanced.  The newest types of systems may have the ability to: identify a RFID tag by a specific resident and forward that name to the staff; give staff a last known location of the resident; show a photo of the resident at the staff station with a mapped out door location; report the frequency, times and severity of the incidents; and finally, integrate with other access control systems, [[HVAC]], fire alarm equipment and phone equipment.

The reason this type of system seems to be preferable is that it helps monitor those at risk for wandering and elopements while not infringing on the freedom of other residents or visitors to a facility.
