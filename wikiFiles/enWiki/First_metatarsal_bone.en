The '''first metatarsal bone''' is the [[bone]] in the [[foot]] just behind the [[Hallux|big]] [[toe]]. The first metatarsal bone is the shortest of the [[Metatarsus|metatarsal bones]] and by far the thickest and strongest of them.<ref name=Bojsen246>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=246 |accessdate=Marts 1, 2012}}</ref>  

As the four other metatarsals bone it can be divided into three parts; base, body and head.
The base is the part closest to the ankle and the head is closest to the big toe. The narrowed part in the middle is referred to as the body of the bone. The bone is somewhat flatten giving it to sides; the plantar (towards the [[Sole (foot)|sole of the foot]]) and the dorsal side (the area facing upwards while standing).<ref name=Bojsen246/>

The base presents, as a rule, no [[articular facets]] (joint surfaces) on its sides, but occasionally on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|lateral]] side there is an oval facet, by which it articulates with the [[second metatarsal]]. On the lateral part of the planter surface there is a rough oval prominence, or tuberosity, for the insertion of the [[tendon]] of the [[fibularis longus]]. 

The first metatarsal articulates (forms [[joints]]) with the [[Medial cuneiform bone|medial cuneiform]], and to a small extent to the [[intermediate cuneiform bone]].<ref name="Platzer-218">Platzer 2004, p 218</ref> Its proximal articular surface is large and [[kidney]]-shaped; its circumference is grooved, for the [[tarsometatarsal ligaments]], and medially gives insertion to part of the tendon of the [[tibialis anterior]]; 

The body of the bone is strong, and of well-marked prismoid form. 

The head is large; on its plantar surface are two grooved facets, on which glide [[sesamoid bones]]; the facets are separated by a smooth elevation.

Three muscles attaches to the first metatarsal bone; the [[Tibialis anterior muscle|tibialis anterior]], [[fibularis longus]] and [[Dorsal interossei of the foot|first dorsal interossei]].<ref name=Bojsen364-367>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=364-367 |accessdate=Marts 1, 2012}}</ref>  

The tibialis anterior inserts a the basis of the bone, while the fibularis longus inserts at the tuberosity.
The lateral part of the first dorsal interossei muscle originates from the medial side of the bone. The function of the muscle is to spread the toes.<ref name=Bojsen300-301>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=300-301 |accessdate=Marts 1, 2012}}</ref>
