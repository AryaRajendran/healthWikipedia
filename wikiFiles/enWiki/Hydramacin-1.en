'''Hydramacin-1''' is a type of [[antimicrobial]] [[protein]]. It was first isolated and reproduced in 2008 from cells of the freshwater [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroid]] ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]''. Only around 60 [[amino acid]]s long, the protein is unique both in amino acid sequence and [[tertiary structure]], prompting its classification in a new family of proteins, the [[macin protein family|macins]]. The protein's unusual structure is most likely a reason for the compound's potent antimicrobial qualities.<ref name="Jung2009">{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=Sascha|coauthors=Andrew J.

Antimicrobial tests determined that the protein has an antibacterial effect against both [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacteria. This potent antibacterial activity extended to known [[antibiotic resistance|multi-resistant]] strains of pathogenic bacteria, such as those of ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]''. Functionally, the protein causes bacterial cells to clump together and aggregate, changing the morphology of the bacterial aggregations it creates. This results in a disruption of the structure of the bacterial membrane.<ref name="Jung2009"/>

Hydramacin-1 was first isolated from [[epithelial]] cells of the [[cnidaria]]n ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', a small (almost-microscopic) freshwater animal related to [[coral]]s, [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]].<ref name="ITISHydra">{{ITIS | id = 50845 | taxon = Hydra | accessdate = 23 January 2009 }}</ref><ref name="ITISScyphozoa">{{ITIS | id =51483 | taxon = Scyphozoa | accessdate = 23 January 2009 }}</ref><ref name="ITISAnthozoa">{{ITIS | id =51938 | taxon = Anthozoa | accessdate = 23 January 2009 }}</ref><ref name="ITISCnidaria">{{ITIS | id =48738 | taxon = Cnidaria | accessdate = 23 January 2009 }}</ref> Like other members of the [[Phylum]] [[Cnidaria]], ''Hydra'' possesses specialized defensive epithelial cells called [[cnidocyte]]s that shoot [[toxic]] barbs into organisms they come in physical contact with. German researchers managed to isolate the [[gene]] that coded for the production of the protein from the ''Hydra'' genome in 2008. The gene was transferred and cloned in a [[plasmid]] ([[Pet32a]]) which was inserted in the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', a standard method of replicating a protein isolated from a much larger organism.<ref name="Jung2009"/> The three-dimensional structure of the resulting protein was then determined by [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|
NMR spectroscopy]] and is now published online by the [[Protein Data Bank]].<ref name="PDBHydramacin1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2K35|title=Hydramacin-1 (2K35)|publisher=Protein Data Bank|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref> 

Hydramacin-1 is a single-chain protein composed of sixty [[amino acid]]s. It is a unique combination of amino acids on the surface of the molecule that gives the protein its potent antimicrobial qualities. This specialized part of the protein tertiary structure, a positively charged belt in between two [[hydrophobic]] (and ionically inert) regions, has been suggested as the trigger for bacterial aggregation influence by the protein.<ref name="Jung2009"/>

Hydramacin-1 is different from any other antibacterial currently known, except for two proteins found in [[leech]]es. The researchers propose placing hydramacin-1 and the proteins from the leech in a newly designated protein family called the [[macin protein family|macins]]. The proteins closest in structure to the macins are a [[Superfamily (molecular biology)|superfamily]] of proteins derived from [[scorpion]] [[venom]], dubbed the [[scorpion oxin]]s.<ref name=SD20090117>
