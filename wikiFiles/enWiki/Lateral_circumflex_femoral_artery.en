The '''lateral circumflex femoral artery''' ('''lateral femoral circumflex artery''', '''external circumflex artery''') is an [[artery]] in the upper thigh.

==Structure==
The lateral femoral circumflex artery arises from the lateral side of the [[profunda femoris artery]], passes horizontally between the divisions of the [[femoral nerve]], and behind the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]] and [[rectus femoris]], and divides into ascending, transverse, and [[Descending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery|descending]] branches. The lateral femoral circumflex artery may occasionally arise directly from the [[femoral artery]].
