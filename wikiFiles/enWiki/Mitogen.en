A '''mitogen''' is a [[chemical substance]] that encourages a cell to commence [[cell division]], triggering [[mitosis]].  A mitogen is usually some form of a [[protein]]. 

'''Mitogenesis''' is the induction (triggering) of mitosis, typically via a mitogen.

Mitogens trigger [[signal transduction]] pathways in which [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK) is involved, leading to mitosis.

==Use in immunology==

[[B cell]]s can enter mitosis when they encounter an [[antigen]] matching their [[Antibody|immunoglobulin]]. 

Mitogens are often used to stimulate [[lymphocyte]]s and therefore assess immune function.

The most commonly used mitogens in clinical laboratory medicine are:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name''' || '''Acts upon [[T cell]]s?''' || '''Acts upon [[B cell]]s?''' 
 |- 
 | [[phytohaemagglutinin]] (PHA) || yes || no
 |- 
 | [[concanavalin A]] (conA) || yes || no
 |- 
 | [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS) || no || yes
 |- 
 | [[pokeweed mitogen]] (PWM) || yes || yes 
|}

[[Lipopolysaccharide]] [[toxin]] from [[gram-negative bacteria]] is [[thymus]]-independent. They may directly activate B cells, regardless of their [[antigen]]ic [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]].

[[Plasma cell]]s are terminally [[Cellular differentiation| differentiated]] and, therefore, cannot undergo mitosis.  [[Memory B cell]]s can proliferate to produce more memory cells or plasma B cells.  This is how the mitogen works, that is, by inducing mitosis in memory B cells to cause them to divide, with some becoming plasma cells.

==Mitogens in human physiology==

[[Insulin-like Growth Factor 1]] mediates the major growth-promoting effect of [[Human Growth Hormone]] as a [[paracrine agent]] at growth plates in the skeletal system. another example for mitogen agent is G-CSF.

==Other uses==
Mitogens also induce the activity of the [[PTGS2]] [[enzyme]].
