'''Progressive disease''' or '''progressive illness''' is a [[disease]] or physical ailment whose [[Course (medicine)|course]] in most cases is the worsening, growth, or spread of the disease. This may happen until [[death]], serious [[Debility (medical)|debility]], or [[organ failure]] occurs. Some progressive diseases can be halted and reversed by treatment. Many can be slowed by [[medical therapy]]. Some cannot be altered by current treatments.

Though the time distinctions are imprecise, diseases can be ''rapidly progressive'' (typically days to weeks) or ''slowly progressive'' (months to years). Virtually all slowly progressive diseases are also [[chronic disease]]s in terms of time course; many of these are also referred to as [[degenerative disease]]s. Not all chronic diseases are progressive: a chronic, non-progressive disease may be referred to as a ''static'' condition. 

==Examples==
There are examples of slowly and rapidly progressive diseases affecting all [[organ systems]] and parts of the body. The following are some examples of rapidly and slowly progressive diseases affecting various organ systems:
*[[human brain|Brain]]: [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] progresses rapidly compared to [[Alzheimer's disease]].
*[[human eye|Eye]]s: [[Cataract]]s can be static or slowly progressive. [[Macular degeneration]] is slowly progressive, while [[retinal detachment]] is rapidly progressive.
*[[human lung|Lung]]s: [[Emphysema]] due to [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]] is a slowly progressive [[pulmonary disease]].
*[[Kidney]]s: [[Goodpasture's syndrome]] is a rapidly progressive [[glomerulonephritis]], while [[diabetic glomerulosclerosis]] is slowly progressive.
*[[Pancreas]]: [[Type 1 diabetes mellitus]] involves rapidly progressive loss of [[insulin]] secretory capacity compared to [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], in which the loss of insulin secretion is slowly progressive over many years. [[MODY 2]], due to ''GCK'' [[mutation]], is a relatively static form of reduced insulin secretion.
*[[Joint]]s: Both [[osteoarthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] are slowly progressive forms of [[arthritis]].
*[[Nerve]]s: [[Essential tremor]] is a slowly progressive neurological disorder which is usually [[Heredity|genetically]] passed down.
