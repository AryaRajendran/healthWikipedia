With limited resources, some states are placing a priority on testing hospitalized patients, which may create a false impression that the virus is becoming more lethal, Richard Besser, MD, the CDC's acting director, said at a media briefing yesterday.

However, he added that scaled-back testing is also in line with how public health officials handle testing for seasonal influenza. Given that the swine flu outbreak seems to resemble seasonal flu, expect the CDC to revise some of its recommendations and change some of its reporting practices, he said.

As the disease becomes more widespread, tallies of individual cases won't be as meaningful, but health authorities will want to know what regions of the country are affected and to what extent, Besser said. For reporting on the swine flu outbreak, the CDC will likely use the surveillance and reporting model it uses for seasonal flu.

Minnesota is among states that have announced a cutback in influenza testing. In a May 4 press release, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) said it was asking healthcare providers to submit lab specimens only when a patient has been hospitalized for flu-like like symptoms. It will also continue to accept specimens from the state's 29 sentinel influenza surveillance sites and for ill healthcare workers.

:May 9, 2009 — The confirmed numbers of influenza A (H1N1) cases reported are likely to fall far short of the actual numbers occurring within the community, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson.
