'''Mesothelioma''' (or, more precisely, '''malignant mesothelioma''') is a rare form of [[cancer]] that develops from cells of the [[mesothelium]], the protective lining that covers many of the internal organs of the body. Mesothelioma is most commonly caused by exposure to [[asbestos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/type/mesothelioma/about/mesothelioma-risks-and-causes |title=Mesothelioma risks and causes : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK |publisher=Cancerhelp.org.uk |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref> The most common anatomical site for mesothelioma is the [[pleura]] (the outer lining of the [[lung]]s and internal chest wall), but it can also arise in the [[peritoneum]] (the lining of the abdominal cavity), the [[pericardium]] (the sac that surrounds the [[heart]]),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ashrafian H, Athanasiou T, Yap J, DeSouza AC |title=Two-chamber intracardiac mesothelioma |journal=Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=184–6 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15905353 |url=http://asianannals.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15905353}}</ref> or the [[tunica vaginalis]] (a sac that surrounds the testis).

Most people who develop mesothelioma have worked in jobs where they inhaled or ingested asbestos fibers, or were exposed to airborne asbestos dust and fibers in other ways. It has also been suggested that washing clothes of a family member who worked with asbestos increases their risk for developing mesothelioma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eastbourne Today|title=Woman's death from asbestos|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news?articleid=2857574|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> Unlike lung cancer, there seems to be no association between mesothelioma and tobacco [[smoking]], but smoking greatly increases the risk of other asbestos-induced cancers.<ref name="muscat">{{cite journal |title=Cigarette smoking, asbestos exposure, and malignant mesothelioma |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=51 |issue=9 |pages=2263–7 |year=1991 |month=May |pmid=2015590 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2015590 |author1=Muscat JE |author2=Wynder EL |author-separator=,}}</ref> Some people who were exposed to asbestos have collected damages for asbestos-related disease, including mesothelioma. Compensation via asbestos funds or class action lawsuits is an important issue in law practices regarding mesothelioma (see [[asbestos and the law]]).

Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma include [[shortness of breath]] due to [[pleural effusion]] (fluid between the lung and the chest wall), chest wall pain, and constitutional signs such as unexplained weight loss. The diagnosis may be suspected based on [[chest X-ray]] and [[CT scan]] findings, but must be confirmed either by examining serous effusion [[cytology]] or with a [[biopsy]] (removing a sample of the suspicious tissue). A [[thoracoscopy]] (inserting a tube with a camera into the chest) can be used to acquire biopsy material, and allows the introduction of substances such as [[talc]] to obliterate the pleural space (a procedure called [[pleurodesis]]), preventing more fluid from accumulating and pressing on the lung. Despite treatment with [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]] or sometimes [[surgery]], mesothelioma carries a poor prognosis. Research about [[screening test]]s for the early detection of mesothelioma is ongoing.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms or signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 20 to 50 years (or more) after exposure to asbestos. Shortness of breath, cough, and pain in the chest due to an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space ([[pleural effusion]]) are often symptoms of pleural mesothelioma.<ref name="Diffuse">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jaoa.org/content/106/12/699.long|last1=Barreiro|first1=TJ|last2=Katzman|first2=PJ |title=Malignant mesothelioma: a case presentation and review|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=106 |issue=12 |pages=699-704|year=2006 |pmid=17242414}}</ref>

Symptoms of [[peritoneum|peritoneal]] mesothelioma include weight loss and [[cachexia]], abdominal swelling and pain due to [[ascites]] (a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity). Other symptoms of [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] may include bowel obstruction, blood clotting abnormalities, [[anemia]], and [[fever]]. If the cancer has spread beyond the mesothelium to other parts of the body, symptoms may include pain, trouble swallowing, or swelling of the neck or face.

These symptoms may be caused by mesothelioma or by other, less serious conditions.

Mesothelioma that affects the pleura can cause these signs and symptoms:<ref name="Diffuse"/>
* Chest wall pain
* Pleural effusion, or fluid surrounding the lung
* Shortness of breath
* Fatigue or anemia
* Wheezing, hoarseness, or cough
* Blood in the [[sputum]] (fluid) coughed up ([[hemoptysis]])

In severe cases, the person may have many [[tumor]] masses. The individual may develop a [[pneumothorax]], or collapse of the [[lung]]. The disease may [[metastasize]], or spread, to other parts of the body.

Tumors that affect the abdominal cavity often do not cause symptoms until they are at a late stage. Symptoms include:
* Abdominal pain
* [[Ascites]], or an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen
* A mass in the abdomen
* Problems with bowel function
* Weight loss

In severe cases of the disease, the following signs and symptoms may be present:
* Blood clots in the veins, which may cause [[thrombophlebitis]]
* [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]], a disorder causing severe bleeding in many body organs
* [[Jaundice]], or yellowing of the eyes and skin
* Low blood sugar level
* Pleural effusion
* Pulmonary emboli, or blood clots in the arteries of the lungs
* Severe ascites

A mesothelioma does not usually spread to the bone, brain, or adrenal glands. Pleural tumors are usually found only on one side of the lungs.

However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos. In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with irradiation, intrapleural thorium dioxide ([[Thorotrast]]), and inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as [[erionite]].

Asbestos was known in antiquity, but it was not mined and widely used commercially until the late 19th century. Its use greatly increased during [[World War II]]. Since the early 1940s, millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos dust. Initially, the risks associated with asbestos exposure were not publicly known. However, an increased risk of developing mesothelioma was later found among shipyard workers, people who work in asbestos mines and mills, producers of asbestos products, workers in the heating and construction industries, and other tradespeople. Today, the official position of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the U.S. EPA is that protections and "permissible exposure limits" required by U.S. regulations, while adequate to prevent most asbestos-related non-malignant disease, they are ''not'' adequate to prevent or protect against asbestos-related cancers such as mesothelioma.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-103/pdfs/81-103.pdf NIOSH Working Group Paper from the Centers for Disease Control, 1980]</ref> Likewise, the British Government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) states formally that any threshold for mesothelioma must be at a very low level and it is widely agreed that if any such threshold does exist at all, then it cannot currently be quantified. For practical purposes, therefore, HSE assumes that no such "safe" threshold exists. Others have noted as well that there is no evidence of a threshold level below which there is no risk of mesothelioma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hillerdal G |title=Mesothelioma: cases associated with non-occupational and low dose exposures |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=56 |issue=8 |pages=505–13 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10492646 |pmc=1757769 |doi=10.1136/oem.56.8.505 }}</ref> There appears to be a linear, dose-response relationship, with increasing dose producing increasing disease.<ref name="Peto 1982"/> Nevertheless, mesothelioma may be related to brief, low level or indirect exposures to asbestos.<ref name="fibertypes"/> The dose necessary for effect appears to be lower for asbestos-induced mesothelioma than for pulmonary asbestosis or lung cancer.<ref name="fibertypes"/>  Again, there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos as it relates to increased risk of mesothelioma.

The duration of exposure to asbestos causing mesothelioma can be short. For example, cases of mesothelioma have been documented with only 1–3 months of exposure.<ref name="Burdorf">{{cite journal |author=Burdorf A, Dahhan M, Swuste P |title=Occupational characteristics of cases with asbestos-related diseases in The Netherlands |journal=Ann Occup Hyg |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=485–92 |year=2003 |pmid=12890657 |doi= 10.1093/annhyg/meg062|url=http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12890657}}</ref><ref name="Gilson">{{cite journal |title=Hygiene standards for airborne amosite asbestos dust.

Latency, the time from first exposure to manifestation of disease, is prolonged in the case of mesothelioma. It is virtually never less than fifteen years and peaks at 30–40 years.<ref name="fibertypes"/> In a review of occupationally related mesothelioma cases, the median latency was 32 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lanphear BP, Buncher CR |title=Latent period for malignant mesothelioma of occupational origin |journal=J Occup Med |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=718–21 |year=1992 |month=July |pmid=1494965 }}</ref> Based upon the data from Peto ''et al.'', the risk of mesothelioma appears to increase to the third or fourth power from first exposure.<ref name="Peto 1982">{{cite journal |author=Peto J, Seidman H, Selikoff IJ |title=Mesothelioma mortality in asbestos workers: implications for models of carcinogenesis and risk assessment |journal=Br.

===Environmental exposures===
Incidence of mesothelioma had been found to be higher in populations living near naturally occurring asbestos. For example, in central [[Cappadocia]], Turkey, mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths in three small villages — Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır. Initially, this was attributed to [[erionite]], a [[Zeolite#Zeolite mineral species|zeolite]] mineral with similar properties to [[asbestos]]. Recently, however, detailed epidemiological investigation showed that erionite causes mesothelioma mostly in families with a genetic predisposition.<ref>{{cite journal

The documented presence of asbestos fibers in water supplies and food products has fostered concerns about the possible impact of long-term and, as yet, unknown exposure of the general population to these fibers.

===Occupational===

Exposure to asbestos fibers has been recognized as an occupational health hazard since the early 20th century. Numerous epidemiological studies have associated occupational exposure to asbestos with the development of pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, asbestosis, carcinoma of the lung and larynx, gastrointestinal tumors, and diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum.  Asbestos has been widely used in many industrial products, including cement, brake linings, gaskets, roof shingles, flooring products, textiles, and insulation.

Commercial asbestos mining at Wittenoom, Western Australia, occurred between 1945 and 1966. A [[cohort study]] of miners employed at the mine reported that while no deaths occurred within the first 10 years after [[crocidolite]] exposure, 85 deaths attributable to mesothelioma had occurred by 1985. By 1994, 539 reported deaths due to mesothelioma had been reported in Western Australia.

===Paraoccupational secondary exposure===

Family members and others living with asbestos workers have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma, and possibly other asbestos related diseases.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2002-113/2002-113.html Protecting Workers' Families: A Research Agenda].

To reduce the chance of exposing family members to asbestos fibres, asbestos workers are usually required to shower and change their clothing before leaving the workplace.

===Asbestos in buildings===

Many building materials used in both public and domestic premises prior to the banning of asbestos may contain asbestos. Those performing renovation works or [[Do it yourself|DIY]] activities may expose themselves to asbestos dust. In the UK use of Chrysotile asbestos was banned at the end of 1999. Brown and [[Riebeckite|blue asbestos]] was banned in the UK around 1985. Buildings built or renovated prior to these dates may contain asbestos materials.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MesotheliomaCXR.png|thumb|CXR demonstrating a mesothelioma]]
[[Image:Tumor Mesothelioma2 legend.jpg|thumb|CT scan of a patient with mesothelioma, [[Coronal plane|coronal section]] (the section follows the plane that divides the body in a front and a back half). The mesothelioma is indicated by yellow arrows, the central [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection) is marked with a yellow star. Red numbers: (1) right lung, (2) spine, (3) left lung, (4) ribs, (5) [[Descending aorta|descending]] part of the [[aorta]], (6) [[spleen]], (7) left [[kidney]], (8) right kidney, (9) [[liver]].]]
[[Image:Mesothelioma cytology 1.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a [[pleural fluid]] [[cytopathology]] specimen showing mesothelioma.]]
[[File:Mesothelioma.PNG|thumb|[[Micrograph]]s showing mesothelioma in a core biopsy.]]

Diagnosing mesothelioma is often difficult, because the symptoms are similar to those of a number of other conditions. Diagnosis begins with a review of the patient's medical history. A history of exposure to asbestos may increase clinical suspicion for mesothelioma. A physical examination is performed, followed by [[chest X-ray]] and often [[spirometry|lung function tests]]. The X-ray may reveal pleural thickening commonly seen after asbestos exposure and increases suspicion of mesothelioma.<ref name="Diffuse"/> A [[computed tomography|CT]] (or CAT) scan or an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] is usually performed. If a large amount of fluid is present, abnormal cells may be detected by [[cytopathology]] if this fluid is [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspirated]] with a syringe. For pleural fluid, this is done by [[thoracentesis]] or tube thoracostomy ([[chest tube]]); for ascites, with [[paracentesis]] or [[ascitic drain]]; and for [[Pericardium|pericardial]] effusion with [[pericardiocentesis]]. While absence of malignant cells on cytology does not completely exclude mesothelioma, it makes it much more unlikely, especially if an alternative diagnosis can be made (e.g. [[tuberculosis]], [[heart failure]]). Using conventional cytology  diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is difficult, but immunocytochemistry has greatly enhanced the accuracy of cytology.

Generally, a [[biopsy]] is needed to confirm a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. A doctor removes a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a [[histopathology|pathologist]]. A biopsy may be done in different ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located. If the cancer is in the chest, the doctor may perform a [[thoracoscopy]]. In this procedure, the doctor makes a small cut through the chest wall and puts a thin, lighted tube called a thoracoscope into the chest between two ribs. Thoracoscopy allows the doctor to look inside the chest and obtain tissue samples. Alternatively, the chest surgeon might directly open the chest ([[thoracotomy]]). If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a [[laparoscopy]]. To obtain tissue for examination, the doctor makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a special instrument into the abdominal cavity. If these procedures do not yield enough tissue, more extensive diagnostic surgery may be necessary.

Immunohistochemical studies play an important role for the pathologist in differentiating malignant mesothelioma from neoplastic mimics. There are numerous tests and panels available. No single test is perfect for distinguishing mesothelioma from carcinoma or even benign versus malignant.  Currently, there is no FDA approved immunohistochemistry assay for the diagnosis of mesothelioma so different cancer centers use different panels.

There are three histological types of malignant mesothelioma: (1) Epithelioid; (2) Sarcomatoid; and (3) Biphasic (Mixed). Epithelioid comprises about 50-60% of malignant mesothelioma cases and generally holds a better prognosis than the Sarcomatoid or Biphasic subtypes.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/thorax.55.9.731 | author = Edwards JG, Abrams KR, Leverment JN ''et al.'' | year = 2000 | title = Prognostic factors for malignant mesothelioma in 142 patients: validation of CALGB and EORTC prognostic scoring systems | journal = Thorax | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 731–5 | pmid = 10950889 | pmc = 1745842 }}</ref>

== Screening ==
There is no universally agreed protocol for screening people who have been exposed to asbestos. Screening tests might diagnose mesothelioma earlier than conventional methods thus improving the survival prospects for patients. The [[blood plasma|serum]] [[osteopontin]] level might be useful in screening asbestos-exposed people for mesothelioma. The level of soluble mesothelin-related protein is elevated in the serum of about 75% of patients at diagnosis and it has been suggested that it may be useful for screening.<ref name=smrp>{{cite journal |title=Soluble mesothelin-related protein&mdash;a blood test for mesothelioma |journal=Lung Cancer |volume=49 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S109–11 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15950789 |doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2005.03.020 |display-authors=3 |author1=Robinson BW |author2=Creaney J |author3=Lake R |author-separator=, |last4=Nowak |first4=A |last5=Musk |first5=AW |last6=De Klerk |first6=N |last7=Winzell |first7=P |last8=Hellstrom |first8=KE |last9=Hellstrom |first9=I}}</ref> Doctors have begun testing the [[Mesomark assay]] which measures levels of soluble [[mesothelin]]-related proteins (SMRPs) released by diseased mesothelioma cells.<ref name="Beyer">{{cite journal | last=Beyer | first=HL | title=MESOMARK: a potential test for malignant pleural mesothelioma | journal=Clinical Chemistry | volume=53 | issue=4 | pages=666–672 | month=April | year=2007 | pmid=17289801 | doi=10.1373/clinchem.2006.079327 | author1=Geschwindt RD | author2=, Glover CL et al. | author-separator=, | last3=Glover | first3=C.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Diffuse pleural mesothelioma.jpg|thumb|Diffuse pleural mesothelioma with extensive involvement of the pericardium.]]
The [[mesothelium]] consists of a single layer of flattened to cuboidal cells forming the [[epithelium|epithelial]] lining of the serous cavities of the body including the [[peritoneum|peritoneal]], [[pericardium|pericardial]] and [[pleura]]l cavities. Deposition of asbestos fibers in the [[parenchyma]] of the lung may result in the penetration of the [[visceral pleura]] from where the fiber can then be carried to the pleural surface, thus leading to the development of malignant mesothelial plaques. The processes leading to the development of [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] remain unresolved, although it has been proposed that asbestos fibers from the lung are transported to the abdomen and associated organs via the [[lymphatic system]]. Additionally, asbestos fibers may be deposited in the gut after ingestion of sputum contaminated with asbestos fibers.

Pleural contamination with asbestos or other mineral fibers has been shown to cause cancer. Long thin asbestos fibers (blue asbestos, [[amphibole]] fibers) are more potent [[carcinogen]]s than "feathery fibers" ([[chrysotile]] or white asbestos fibers).<ref name="fibertypes">{{cite journal |title=Malignant mesothelioma and occupational exposure to asbestos: a clinicopathological correlation of 1445 cases |journal=Ultrastruct Pathol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=55–65 |year=2002 |pmid=12036093 |doi=10.1080/01913120252959227 |author1=Roggli VL |author2=Sharma A |author3=Butnor KJ |author4=Sporn T |author5=Vollmer RT |author-separator=,}}</ref>  However, there is now evidence that smaller particles may be more dangerous than the larger fibers. They remain suspended in the air where they can be inhaled, and may penetrate more easily and deeper into the lungs. "We probably will find out a lot more about the health aspects of asbestos from [the World Trade Center attack], unfortunately," said Dr. Alan Fein, chief of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. Dr. Fein has treated several patients for "World Trade Center syndrome" or respiratory ailments from brief exposures of only a day or two near the collapsed buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2001Q4/junkman.html |title=The Junkman's Answer to Terrorism: Use More Asbestos &#124; Center for Media and Democracy |publisher=Prwatch.org |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref>

Mesothelioma development in rats has been demonstrated following intra-pleural inoculation of phosphorylated chrysotile fibers. It has been suggested that in humans, transport of fibers to the pleura is critical to the pathogenesis of mesothelioma. This is supported by the observed recruitment of significant numbers of [[macrophage]]s and other cells of the [[immune system]] to localized lesions of accumulated asbestos fibers in the pleural and peritoneal cavities of rats. These lesions continued to attract and accumulate macrophages as the disease progressed, and cellular changes within the lesion culminated in a morphologically malignant tumor.

Experimental evidence suggests that asbestos acts as a complete carcinogen with the development of mesothelioma occurring in sequential stages of initiation and promotion. The molecular mechanisms underlying the malignant transformation of normal mesothelial cells by asbestos fibers remain unclear despite the demonstration of its oncogenic capabilities (see next-but-one paragraph). However, complete in vitro transformation of normal human mesothelial cells to malignant [[phenotype]] following exposure to asbestos fibers has not yet been achieved. In general, asbestos fibers are thought to act through direct physical interactions with the cells of the mesothelium in conjunction with indirect effects following interaction with inflammatory cells such as macrophages.

Analysis of the interactions between asbestos fibers and [[DNA]] has shown that phagocytosed fibers are able to make contact with [[chromosome]]s, often adhering to the [[chromatin]] fibers or becoming entangled within the chromosome. This contact between the asbestos fiber and the chromosomes or structural proteins of the spindle apparatus can induce complex abnormalities. The most common abnormality is [[monosomy]] of chromosome 22. Other frequent abnormalities include structural rearrangement of 1p, 3p, 9p and 6q chromosome arms.

Common gene abnormalities in mesothelioma cell lines include deletion of the [[tumor suppressor gene]]s:

* [[Neurofibromatosis]] type 2 at 22q12
* [[p16 (gene)|P16<sup>INK4A</sup>]]
* [[p14arf|P14<sup>ARF</sup>]]

Asbestos has also been shown to mediate the entry of foreign DNA into target cells. Incorporation of this foreign DNA may lead to mutations and oncogenesis by several possible mechanisms:

* Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
* Activation of [[oncogene]]s
* Activation of [[proto-oncogene]]s due to incorporation of foreign DNA containing a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region
* Activation of [[DNA repair]] enzymes, which may be prone to error
* Activation of [[telomerase]]
* Prevention of [[apoptosis]]

Asbestos fibers have been shown to alter the function and secretory properties of macrophages, ultimately creating conditions which favour the development of mesothelioma. Following asbestos phagocytosis, macrophages generate increased amounts of hydroxyl [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which are normal by-products of cellular anaerobic metabolism. However, these free radicals are also known [[clastogenic]] and membrane-active agents thought to promote asbestos carcinogenicity. These oxidants can participate in the oncogenic process by directly and indirectly interacting with DNA, modifying membrane-associated cellular events, including oncogene activation and perturbation of cellular antioxidant defences.

Asbestos also may possess [[immunosuppressant|immunosuppressive]] properties. For example, chrysotile fibres have been shown to depress the in vitro proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, suppress natural killer cell lysis and significantly reduce [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]] viability and recovery. Furthermore, genetic alterations in asbestos-activated macrophages may result in the release of potent mesothelial cell mitogens such as [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF) and [[transforming growth factor]]-β (TGF-β) which in turn, may induce the chronic stimulation and proliferation of mesothelial cells after injury by asbestos fibres.

==Treatment==
The prognosis for malignant mesothelioma remains disappointing, although there have been some modest improvements in prognosis from newer chemotherapies and multimodality treatments.<ref name="Borasio 2008">{{cite journal |author=Borasio P, Berruti A, Billé A, ''et al.'' |title=Malignant pleural mesothelioma: clinicopathologic and survival characteristics in a consecutive series of 394 patients |journal=Eur J Cardiothorac Surg |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=307–13 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18164622 |doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2007.09.044 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1010-7940(07)00998-0}}</ref> Treatment of malignant mesothelioma at earlier stages has a better prognosis, but cures are exceedingly rare. Clinical behavior of the malignancy is affected by several factors including the continuous mesothelial surface of the pleural cavity which favors local metastasis via exfoliated cells, invasion to underlying tissue and other organs within the pleural cavity, and the extremely long latency period between asbestos exposure and development of the disease. The histological subtype and the patient's age and health status also help predict prognosis. The epithelioid histology responds better to treatment and has a survival advantage over sarcomatoid histology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haber SE, Haber JM |title=Malignant mesothelioma: a clinical study of 238 cases |journal=Ind Health |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=166–72 |year=2011 |pmid=21173534 |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/indhealth/MS1147?from=PubMed |doi=10.2486/indhealth.MS1147}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===
Surgery, by itself, has proved disappointing. In one large series, the median survival with surgery (including extrapleural [[pneumonectomy]]) was only 11.7 months.<ref name="Borasio 2008"/> However, research indicates varied success when used in combination with radiation and chemotherapy (Duke, 2008). (For more information on  multimodality therapy with surgery, see below). A pleurectomy/decortication is the most common surgery, in which the lining of the chest is removed. Less common is an extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), in which the lung, lining of the inside of the chest, the hemi-[[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and the [[pericardium]] are removed.

=== Radiation ===
For patients with localized disease, and who can tolerate a radical surgery, radiation is often given post-operatively as a consolidative treatment. The entire hemi-thorax is treated with radiation therapy, often given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Delivering radiation and chemotherapy after a radical surgery has led to extended life expectancy in selected patient populations with some patients surviving more than 5 years. As part of a curative approach to mesothelioma, radiotherapy is also commonly applied to the sites of [[chest drain]] insertion, in order to prevent growth of the tumor along the track in the chest wall.

Although mesothelioma is generally resistant to curative treatment with [[radiotherapy]] alone, palliative treatment regimens are sometimes used to relieve symptoms arising from tumor growth, such as obstruction of a major blood vessel. Radiation therapy when given alone with curative intent has never been shown to improve survival from mesothelioma. The necessary radiation dose to treat mesothelioma that has not been surgically removed would be very toxic.

=== Chemotherapy ===

Chemotherapy is the only treatment for mesothelioma that has been proven to improve survival in randomised and controlled trials. The landmark study published in 2003 by Vogelzang and colleagues compared [[cisplatin]] chemotherapy alone with a combination of cisplatin and [[pemetrexed]] (brand name Alimta) chemotherapy in patients who had not received chemotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma previously and were not candidates for more aggressive "curative" surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vogelzang NJ, Rusthoven JJ, Symanowski J, ''et al.'' |title=Phase III study of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=21 |issue=14 |pages=2636–44 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12860938 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2003.11.136 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12860938}}</ref> This trial was the first to report a survival advantage from chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma, showing a statistically significant improvement in [[median]] survival from 10 months in the patients treated with cisplatin alone to 13.3 months in the group of patients treated with cisplatin in the combination with pemetrexed and who also received supplementation with folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Vitamin supplementation was given to most patients in the trial and pemetrexed related side effects were significantly less in patients receiving pemetrexed when they also received daily oral folate 500mcg and intramuscular vitamin B<sub>12</sub> 1000mcg every 9 weeks compared with patients receiving pemetrexed without vitamin supplementation. The objective response rate increased from 20% in the cisplatin group to 46% in the combination pemetrexed group. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting, [[stomatitis]], and diarrhoea were more common in the combination pemetrexed group but only affected a minority of patients and overall the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin was well tolerated when patients received vitamin supplementation; both [[quality of life]] and [[lung function tests]] improved in the combination pemetrexed group. In February 2004, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved pemetrexed for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, there are still unanswered questions about the optimal use of chemotherapy, including when to start treatment, and the optimal number of cycles to give.

Cisplatin in combination with [[raltitrexed]] has shown an improvement in survival similar to that reported for pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin, but raltitrexed is no longer commercially available for this indication. For patients unable to tolerate pemetrexed, cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine or vinorelbine is an alternative, or vinorelbine on its own, although a survival benefit has not been shown for these drugs. For patients in whom cisplatin cannot be used, carboplatin can be substituted but non-randomised data have shown lower response rates and high rates of haematological toxicity for carboplatin-based combinations, albeit with similar survival figures to patients receiving cisplatin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santoro A, O'Brien ME, Stahel RA, ''et al.'' |title=Pemetrexed plus cisplatin or pemetrexed plus carboplatin for chemonaïve patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: results of the International Expanded Access Program |journal=J Thorac Oncol |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=756–63 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18594322 |doi=10.1097/JTO.0b013e31817c73d6 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1556-0864&volume=3&issue=7&spage=756}}</ref>

In January 2009, the United States FDA approved using conventional therapies such as surgery in combination with radiation and or chemotherapy on stage I or II Mesothelioma after research conducted by a nationwide study by Duke University concluded an almost 50 point increase in remission rates.

=== Immunotherapy ===
Treatment regimens involving immunotherapy have yielded variable results. For example, intrapleural inoculation of [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin]] (BCG) in an attempt to boost the immune response, was found to be of no benefit to the patient (while it may benefit patients with [[bladder cancer]]). Mesothelioma cells proved susceptible to in vitro lysis by LAK cells following activation by [[interleukin-2]] (IL-2), but patients undergoing this particular therapy experienced major side effects. Indeed, this trial was suspended in view of the unacceptably high levels of IL-2 toxicity and the severity of side effects such as fever and cachexia. Nonetheless, other trials involving interferon alpha have proved more encouraging with 20% of patients experiencing a greater than 50% reduction in tumor mass combined with minimal side effects.

=== Heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ===
A procedure known as heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy was developed by Paul Sugarbaker at the Washington Cancer Institute.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A review of peritoneal mesothelioma at the Washington Cancer Institute |journal=Surg Oncol Clin N Am |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=605–21, xi |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=14567020 |doi= 10.1016/S1055-3207(03)00045-0 |author1=Sugarbaker PH |author2=Welch LS |author3=Mohamed F |author4=Glehen O |author-separator=,}}<br/>Online manual: [http://www.surgicaloncology.com/gpmtitle.htm Management of Peritoneal Surface Malignancy].</ref>  The surgeon removes as much of the tumor as possible followed by the direct administration of a chemotherapy agent, heated to between 40 and 48°C, in the abdomen. The fluid is perfused for 60 to 120 minutes and then drained.

This technique permits the administration of high concentrations of selected drugs into the abdominal and pelvic surfaces. Heating the chemotherapy treatment increases the penetration of the drugs into tissues. Also, heating itself damages the malignant cells more than the normal cells.

This technique is also used in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richards WG, Zellos L, Bueno R, ''et al.'' |title=Phase I to II study of pleurectomy/decortication and intraoperative intracavitary hyperthermic cisplatin lavage for mesothelioma |journal=J.

=== Multimodality therapy ===

All of the standard approaches to treating solid tumors—radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery—have been investigated in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Although surgery, by itself, is not very effective, surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation (trimodality therapy) has produced significant survival extension (3–14 years) among patients with favorable prognostic factors.<ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com">{{cite journal |title=Resection margins, extrapleural nodal status, and cell type determine postoperative long-term survival in trimodality therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma: results in 183 patients |journal=J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=54–63; discussion 63–5 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9869758 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5223(99)70469-1|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022522399000720 |display-authors=3 |author1=Sugarbaker DJ |author2=Flores RM |author3=Jaklitsch MT |author-separator=, |last4=Richards |first4=WG |last5=Strauss |first5=GM |last6=Corson |first6=JM |last7=Decamp Jr |first7=MM |last8=Swanson |first8=SJ |last9=Bueno |first9=R |authorlink2=Raja M.

Two surgeries have been developed: extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. The indications for performing these operations are unique. The choice of operation depends on the size of the patient's tumor. This is an important consideration because tumor volume has been identified as a prognostic factor in mesothelioma.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Preoperative tumor volume is associated with outcome in malignant pleural mesothelioma |journal=J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=115 |pages=310–7; discussion 317–8 |year=1998 |display-authors=3 |author1=Pass HI |author2=Temeck BK |author3=Kranda K |author4=Steinberg SM |author5=Feuerstein IR |author-separator=, |doi=10.1016/S0022-5223(98)70274-0 |pmid=9475525 |issue=2}}</ref> Pleurectomy/decortication spares the underlying lung and is performed in patients with early stage disease when the intention is to remove all gross visible tumor (macroscopic complete resection), not simply palliation.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Macroscopic complete resection: the goal of primary surgery in multimodality therapy for pleural mesothelioma |journal=J Thorac Oncol | volume=1 | pages=175–176 | year=2006 | doi=10.1097/01243894-200602000-00014 | pmid=17409850 | last1=Sugarbaker | first1=DJ | issue=2 }}</ref>  Extrapleural pneumonectomy is a more extensive operation that involves resection of the parietal and visceral pleurae, underlying lung, ipsilateral diaphragm, and ipsilateral pericardium.

===Alternative medicine===

The medicinal plant Ashwagandha (''[[Withania somnifera]]'') has long been used in Indian [[Ayurvedic medicine]]. An extract of this plant, [[Withaferin A]] (WA), has been tested ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' as a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The authors of these tests have concluded that their data "convincingly demonstrate that WA targets multiple pathways to suppress MPM growth ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo,'' and underscore its potential as a future anti-MPM therapy".<ref>Yang H, Wang Y, Cheryan VT, Wu W, Cui CQ, ''et al'' (2012).

==Epidemiology==
Although reported incidence rates have increased in the past 20 years, mesothelioma is still a relatively rare cancer. The incidence rate varies from one country to another, from a low rate of less than 1 per 1,000,000 in Tunisia and Morocco, to the highest rate in Britain, Australia and Belgium: 30 per 1,000,000 per year.<ref name="Bianchi">{{cite journal | last=Bianchi | first=C | title=Malignant mesothelioma: global incidence and relationship with asbestos |journal=Industrial Health | volume=45 | issue=3 | pages=379–387 | month=June | year=2007 | pmid=17634686 | doi=10.2486/indhealth.45.379 | url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth/45/3/379/_pdf | coauthors=Bianchi T }}</ref> For comparison, populations with high levels of smoking can have a [[Lung cancer#Epidemiology|lung cancer]] incidence of over 1,000 per 1,000,000.

==Society and culture==

===Notable cases===
Mesothelioma, though rare, has had a number of notable patients:

*[[Bernie Banton]], an Australian workers' rights activist, fought a long battle for compensation from [[James Hardie]] after he contracted mesothelioma after working for that company.  He claimed James Hardie knew of the dangers of asbestos before he began work with the substance making insulation for power stations.  Mesothelioma eventually took his life along with his brothers and hundreds of James Hardie workers.  James Hardie made an undisclosed settlement with Banton only when his mesothelioma had reached its final stages and he was expected to have no more than 48 hours to live.  Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] mentioned Banton's extended struggle in his acceptance speech after winning the 2007 [[Australian federal election]].

===Notable people who have lived for some time with mesothelioma===
Although life expectancy with this disease is typically limited, there are notable survivors. In July 1982, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] was diagnosed with [[peritoneal mesothelioma]]. After his diagnosis, Gould wrote "The Median Isn't the Message"<ref name="Gould">{{cite web | last = Gould | first = Stephen Jay | title = The Median Isn't the Message | url=http://www.physics.utoledo.edu/~ljc/median1.htm | accessdate = }}</ref> for ''Discover'' magazine, in which he argued that statistics such as median survival are just useful abstractions, not destiny. Gould lived for another 20 years, eventually succumbing to metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, not mesothelioma.

===Legal issues===
{{main|Asbestos and the law}}
The first lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers were in 1929. Since then, many lawsuits have been filed against asbestos manufacturers and employers, for neglecting to implement safety measures after the links between asbestos, asbestosis, and mesothelioma became known (some reports seem to place this as early as 1898).

;History
The first lawsuit against asbestos manufacturers was brought in 1929. The parties settled that lawsuit, and as part of the agreement, the attorneys agreed not to pursue further cases. In 1960, an article published by Wagner et al. was seminal in establishing mesothelioma as a disease arising from exposure to asbestos.<ref name="marchand">{{cite journal |title=Diffuse Pleural Mesothelioma and Asbestos Exposure in the North Western Cape Province |journal=Br J Ind Med. |volume=17 |pages=260–71 |year=1960 |month=October |pmid=13782506 |pmc=1038078 |author1=Wagner JC |author2=Sleggs CA |author3=Marchand P |author-separator=, |issue=4}}</ref> The article referred to over 30 case studies of people who had suffered from mesothelioma in South Africa. Some exposures were transient and some were mine workers.  Prior to the use of advanced microscopy techniques, malignant mesothelioma was often diagnosed as a variant form of lung cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Malignant mesothelioma |journal= Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|volume= 3|issue=34 |pages=1750–1172 |year= 2008|pmid=19099560 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-3-34 |pmc=2652430 |author1=Alastair J Moore|author2=Robert J Parker|author3=John Wiggins|author-separator=, }}</ref> In 1962 McNulty reported the first diagnosed case of malignant mesothelioma in an [[Australia]]n asbestos worker.<ref name="mcnulty">{{cite journal |author=McNulty JC |title=Malignant pleural mesothelioma in an asbestos worker |journal=Med J Aust |volume=49 |issue= 2|pages=953–4 |year=1962 |month=December |pmid=13932248 }}</ref> The worker had worked in the mill at the asbestos mine in [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]] from 1948 to 1950.

In the town of [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]], asbestos-containing mine waste was used to cover schoolyards and playgrounds. In 1965 an article in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine established that people who lived in the neighbourhoods of asbestos factories and mines, but did not work in them, had contracted mesothelioma.

Despite proof that the dust associated with asbestos mining and milling causes asbestos-related disease, mining began at Wittenoom in 1943 and continued until 1966.   In 1974 the first public warnings of the dangers of blue asbestos were published in a cover story called "Is this Killer in Your Home?" in Australia's ''Bulletin'' magazine. In 1978 the [[Western Australia]]n Government decided to phase out the town of Wittenoom, following the publication of a Health Dept. booklet, "The Health Hazard at Wittenoom", containing the results of air sampling and an appraisal of worldwide medical information.

By 1979 the first writs for negligence related to Wittenoom were issued against CSR and its subsidiary ABA, and the Asbestos Diseases Society was formed to represent the Wittenoom victims.

In [[Leeds]], England the [[Armley asbestos disaster]] involved several court cases against [[Turner & Newall]] where local residents who contracted mesothelioma claimed compensation because of the asbestos pollution from the company's factory. One notable case was that of June Hancock, who contracted the disease in 1993 and died in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.junehancockfund.org/|title=June Hancock Research Fund |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref>
