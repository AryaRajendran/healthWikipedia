A '''throat lozenge''' ('''cough drop''', '''troche''', '''cachou''', or '''cough sweet''') is a small, medicated tablet intended to be dissolved slowly in the mouth to temporarily stop coughs and lubricate and soothe irritated tissues of the [[throat]] (usually due to a [[Pharyngitis|sore throat]]), possibly from the [[common cold]] or [[influenza]]. Cough tablets have taken the name [[lozenge]], based on their original shape.

==Ingredients==
Lozenges may contain [[benzocaine]], an [[Anesthesia|anesthetic]], or [[eucalyptus oil]].  Non-menthol throat lozenges generally use either [[zinc gluconate glycine]] or [[pectin]] as an [[demulcent|oral demulcent]]. Several brands of throat lozenges contain [[dextromethorphan]].

Still other varieties, such as [[Halls (cough drop)|Halls]], contain [[menthol]], [[peppermint oil]] and/or [[spearmint]] as their [[active ingredient]](s). [[Honey]] lozenges are also available.

==History==
Candies to soothe the throat date back to 1000&nbsp;BC in [[Egypt]]'s [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]], when they were made from honey flavored with [[citrus]], herbs, and spices.  In the 19th century, physicians discovered [[morphine]] and [[heroin]], which suppress coughing at its source&mdash;the brain.  Popular formulations of that era included [[Smith Brothers]] Cough Drops, first advertised in 1852, and [[Luden's]], created in 1879.  Concern over the risk of [[opioid dependence]] led to the development of alternative medications.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Panati |first=Charles |authorlink= |title=Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things |url= |accessdate= |year=1989 |publisher=Harper & Row |location=New York |isbn=0060964197 |pages=258&ndash;260}}</ref>
