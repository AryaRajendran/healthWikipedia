In [[renal physiology]], '''net acid excretion''' ('''NAE''') is the net amount of acid excreted in the [[urine]] per unit time. Its value depends on urine flow rate, urine acid concentration, and the concentration of [[bicarbonate]] in the urine (the loss of bicarbonate, a [[buffering agent]], is physiologically equivalent to a gain in acid). NAE is commonly expressed in units of [[milliliter]]s per [[minute]] (ml/min) and is given by the following equation:

:<math>NAE = V ( U_{NH_4} + U_{TA} - U_{HCO_3} )</math>

where 

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Variable''' || '''Meaning''' 
 |- 
 | ''NAE''  || net acid excretion 
 |- 
 | ''V''  || volume of urine produced per unit time 
 |- 
 | ''U<sub>NH4</sub>'' || urine concentration of [[ammonium]]
 |- 
 | ''U<sub>TA</sub>'' || urine concentration of [[titratable acid]] (e.g., [[phosphoric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]]) 
 |- 
 | ''U<sub>HCO3</sub>'' || urine concentration of [[bicarbonate]] 
|}

==Pathology==

Increased net acid excretion is a compensation for [[respiratory acidosis]], while decreased net acid excretion is a compenstation for [[respiratory alkalosis]].<ref>http://sprojects.mmi.mcgill.ca/nephrology/presentation/presentation4.htm</ref>
