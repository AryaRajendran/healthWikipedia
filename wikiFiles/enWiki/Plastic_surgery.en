'''Plastic surgery''' is a medical [[:Category:Surgical specialties|specialty]] concerned with the correction or restoration of form and function. Though cosmetic or aesthetic surgery is the best-known kind of plastic surgery, most plastic surgery is not cosmetic;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citelighter.com/science/medicine/knowledgecards/plastic-surgery |title=Plastic surgery |work=Aman Garg |publisher=Citelighter |accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref> plastic surgery includes many types of [[reconstructive surgery]], [[hand surgery]], [[microsurgery]], and the treatment of [[burn]]s.

==Etymology==
In the term '''plastic surgery''', the adjective ''plastic'' denotes ''sculpting'', and derives from the Greek πλαστική (τέχνη), ''plastikē'' (''tekhnē''), “the art of modelling” of malleable [[Tissue (biology)|flesh]].<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''s.v.'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/145291 'plastic']</ref>

==History==
[[File:Walter Yeo skin graft.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Yeo]], a British sailor, is often cited as the first known person to have benefited from plastic surgery. The photograph shows him before the procedure (left) and after (right) receiving a skin [[flap (surgery)|flap]] performed by Sir [[Harold Gillies]] in 1917.]]

[[File:Aulus Cornelius Celsus.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], who lived in the first century AD, described plastic surgery of the face, using skin from other parts of the body]]
The ancient Egyptians and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] also performed plastic cosmetic surgery. The Romans were able to perform simple techniques, such as repairing damaged ears from around the 1st century BC. For religious reasons, they did not dissect either human beings or animals, thus their knowledge was based in its entirety on the texts of their [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] predecessors. Notwithstanding, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] left some surprisingly accurate anatomical descriptions,<ref>Wolfgang H. Vogel, Andreas Berke (2009). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=t_5pzrF1QocC&pg=PA97&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Brief History of Vision and Ocular Medicine]''". Kugler Publications. p.97. ISBN 90-6299-220-X</ref> some of which — for instance, his studies on the genitalia and the skeleton — are of special interest to plastic surgery.<ref>P. Santoni-Rugiu, ''A History of Plastic Surgery'' (2007)</ref>

In 1465, Sabuncu's book, description, and classification of [[hypospadias]] was more informative and up to date. Localization of [[urethral meatus]] was described in detail. Sabuncuoglu also detailed the description and classification of ambiguous genitalia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In mid-15th century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process "to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it" by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not [[history of surgery|until the 19th and 20th centuries]] that such surgery became common.

Up until the techniques of [[anesthesia]] became established, surgeries involving healthy tissues involved great [[pain]]. Infection from surgery was reduced by the introduction of sterile techniques and disinfectants. The invention and use of antibiotics, beginning with [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and [[penicillin]], was another step in making [[elective surgery]] possible.

In 1793, Chopart performed operative procedure on a lip using a flap from the neck. In 1814, Joseph Carpue successfully performed operative procedure on a British military officer who had lost his nose to the toxic effects of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] treatments. In 1818, German surgeon [[Carl Ferdinand von Graefe]] published his major work entitled ''Rhinoplastik''. Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap.

The first American plastic surgeon was [[John Peter Mettauer]], who, in 1827, performed the first [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] operation with instruments that he designed himself. In 1845, [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] wrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty, entitled ''Operative Chirurgie'', and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose.

In 1891, American otorhinolaryngologist John Roe presented an example of his work, a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications. In 1892, Robert Weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts (duck sternum) in the reconstruction of sunken noses. In 1896, [[James Israel]], a urological surgeon from Germany, and in 1889 George Monks of the United States each described the successful use of heterogeneous free-bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects. In 1898, Jacques Joseph, the German orthopaedic-trained surgeon, published his first account of reduction rhinoplasty. In 1928, Jacques Joseph published ''Nasenplastik und Sonstige Gesichtsplastik''.

===20th century===
In [[World War I]], a New Zealand otolaryngologist working in London, [[Harold Gillies]], developed many of the techniques of modern facial surgery in caring for soldiers suffering from disfiguring facial injuries. [[Varaztad Kazanjian]] and Blair, two men hired for plastic surgery by the United States army, learned from Gillies in England.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chambers|first=J|coauthors=P. Ray|title=Achieving growth and excellence in medicine: the case history of armed conflict and modern reconstructive surgery|journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery|year=2009|volume=63|issue=5|pages=473–478|doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181bc327a|pmid=20431512}}</ref> His work was expanded upon during [[World War II]] by his cousin and former student [[Archibald McIndoe]], who pioneered treatments for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircrew suffering from severe burns. McIndoe's radical, experimental treatments, led to the formation of the [[Guinea Pig Club]]. In 1946, Gillies carried out the first [[female-to-male]] sex reassignment surgery.

==Techniques and procedures==
In plastic surgery, the transfer of skin tissue ([[skin graft]]ing) is a very common procedure. Skin grafts can be taken from the recipient or donors:
* [[Autograft]]s are taken from the recipient. If absent or deficient of natural tissue, alternatives can be cultured sheets of [[epithelial cell]]s ''in vitro'' or synthetic compounds, such as integra, which consists of [[silicone]] and bovine tendon collagen with glycosaminoglycans.
* [[Allograft]]s are taken from a donor of the same species.
* [[Xenograft]]s are taken from a donor of a different species.

Usually, good results are expected from plastic surgery that emphasizes careful planning of incisions so that they fall in the line of natural skin folds or lines, appropriate choice of wound closure, use of best available suture materials, and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.

==Reconstructive surgery==

{{Redirect|Reconstructive||Reconstructive plastic surgery}}
Reconstructive plastic surgery is performed to correct functional impairments caused by burns; traumatic injuries, such as facial bone fractures and breaks; congenital abnormalities, such as cleft palates or cleft lips; developmental abnormalities; infection and disease; and [[cancer]] or [[tumor]]s. Reconstructive plastic surgery is usually performed to improve function, but it may be done to approximate a normal appearance.

The most common reconstructive procedures are tumor removal, laceration repair, scar repair, hand surgery, and [[breast reduction plasty]]. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the number of reconstructive breast reductions for women increased in 2007 by 2 percent from the year before. Breast reduction in men also increased in 2007 by 7 percent. Some other common reconstructive surgical procedures include [[breast reconstruction]] after a [[mastectomy]], cleft lip and palate surgery, [[Burn scar contracture|contracture]] surgery for [[Burn (injury)|burn]] survivors, and creating a new outer ear when one is congenitally absent.

Plastic surgeons use microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. [[Free flap]]s of skin, muscle, bone, fat, or a combination may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body, and reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries and veins as small as 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter.

Aesthetic plastic surgery, also called [[Medical aesthetics]], involves techniques intended for the "enhancement" of appearance through surgical and medical techniques, and is specifically concerned with maintaining normal appearance, restoring it, or enhancing it beyond the average level toward some aesthetic ideal.

In 2006, nearly 11 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has increased over 50 percent since the start of the century. Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, nasal surgery, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for thirty-four different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and [[laser hair removal]]. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical (p.&nbsp;5). They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people (p.&nbsp;12).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery|title=Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics|journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal|year=2010|pages=1–18}}</ref>
The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses racial and ethnic lines in the U.S., with increases seen among African-Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans. In Europe, the second largest market for cosmetic procedures, cosmetic surgery is a $2.2 billion business.<ref>[http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?Src=RSS&docid=153913646 "Frost and Sullivan"]</ref> Cosmetic surgery is now very common in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. In Asia, cosmetic surgery has become an accepted practice, and countries such as China and India has become Asia's biggest cosmetic surgery markets.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/news/20100809/india-china-among-plastic-surgery-capitals India, China Among Plastic Surgery Hot Spots] - WebMD</ref> Thailand is also one of the main cosmetic surgery markets in Asia, in particular for affordable breast augmentation and sex reassignment surgery, with international patients coming from Australia, Europe and neighboring Asian countries.<ref>[http://www.novasans.com/articles/breast-augmentation-cost-cheap-breast-implants-in-thailand/ "Breast Augmentation Thailand"] - Novasans</ref>

The most prevalent aesthetic/cosmetic procedures include:
* [[Abdominoplasty]] ("tummy tuck"): reshaping and firming of the [[abdomen]]
* [[Blepharoplasty]] ("eyelid surgery"): reshaping of the eyelids or the application of permanent eyeliner, including [[Asian blepharoplasty]]
* [[Phalloplasty]] ("penile liposuction") : construction (or reconstruction) of a penis or, sometimes, artificial modification of the penis by surgery, often for cosmetic purposes
* [[Mammoplasty]]:
** [[Breast augmentation]]s ("breast implant" or "boob job"): augmentation of the [[breast]]s by means of fat grafting, saline, or silicone gel prosthetics, which was initially performed to women with [[micromastia]]
** [[Reduction mammoplasty]] ("breast reduction"): removal of skin and glandular tissue, which is done to reduce back and shoulder pain in women with [[gigantomastia]] and/or for psychological benefit men with [[gynecomastia]]
** [[Mastopexy]] ("breast lift"): Lifting or reshaping of breasts to make them less saggy, often after weight loss (after a pregnancy, for example). It involves removal of breast skin as opposed to glandular tissue
* [[Buttock augmentation]] ("butt implant"): enhancement of the [[buttock]]s using silicone implants or fat grafting ("Brazilian butt lift") and transfer from other areas of the body
** [[Buttock lift]]: lifting, and tightening of the buttocks by excision of redundant skin
* [[Chemical peel]]: minimizing the appearance of [[acne vulgaris|acne]], [[chicken pox]], and other scars as well as [[wrinkles]] (depending on concentration and type of agent used, except for deep furrows), [[solar lentigines]] (age spots, freckles), and [[skin cancer|photodamage]] in general. Chemical peels commonly involve [[carbolic acid]] (Phenol), [[trichloroacetic acid]] (TCA), [[glycolic acid]] (AHA), or [[salicylic acid]] (BHA) as the active agent.
* [[Labiaplasty]]: surgical reduction and reshaping of the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]]
* [[Lip enhancement]]: surgical improvement of lips' fullness through enlargement
* [[Rhinoplasty]] ("nose job"): reshaping of the [[human nose|nose]]
* [[Otoplasty]] ("ear surgery"/"ear pinning"): reshaping of the [[ear]], most often done by pinning the protruding ear closer to the head.
* [[Rhytidectomy]] ("face lift"): removal of wrinkles and signs of aging from the face
** [[Browplasty]] ("brow lift" or "forehead lift"): elevates eyebrows, smooths forehead skin
** Midface lift ("cheek lift"): tightening of the cheeks
* [[Chin augmentation]] ("chin implant"): augmentation of the [[chin]] with an implant, usually silicone, by [[sliding genioplasty]] of the jawbone or by suture of the soft tissue
* [[Cheek augmentation]] ("cheek implant"): implants to the cheek
* [[Orthognathic Surgery]]: manipulation of the facial bones through controlled fracturing
* Fillers injections: [[collagen]], [[fat]], and other tissue filler injections, such as [[hyaluronic acid]]
* [[Laser]] Skin Rejuvenation or Resurfacing:The lessening of depth in pores of the face
* [[Liposuction]] ("suction lipectomy"): removal of fat deposits by traditional suction technique or ultrasonic energy to aid fat removal
* [[Brachioplasty]] ("Arm lift"): reducing excess skin and fat between the underarm and the elbow<ref>[http://www.novasans.com/articles/arm-lift-brachioplasty/ "Arm lift"] - Novasans</ref>

==Sub-specialties==
Plastic surgery is a broad field, and may be subdivided further. In the United States, plastic surgeons are board certified by [[American Board of Plastic Surgery]] and the [[American Osteopathic Board of Surgery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aobs.org/protocol-for-certification |title=Requirements for Certification |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Surgery |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abplsurg.org/ModDefault.aspx?section=AboutIntro |title=Introduction |author= |year=2013 |work= |publisher=American Board of Plastic Surgery |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> Subdisciplines of plastic surgery may include:

;Burn
Burn surgery generally takes place in two phases. Acute burn surgery is the treatment immediately after a burn. Reconstructive burn surgery takes place after the burn wounds have healed.

;Cosmetic
Aesthetic surgery is an essential component of plastic surgery. Plastic surgeons use cosmetic surgical principles in all reconstructive surgical procedures as well as isolated operations to improve overall appearance.<ref>Description of Plastic Surgery [https://www.abplsurg.org/ModDefault.aspx?section=AboutDPS American Board of Plastic Surgery]</ref>

;Craniofacial
[[Craniofacial surgery]] is divided into pediatric and adult craniofacial surgery. Pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues, such as cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, and pediatric fractures. Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with fractures and secondary surgeries (such as orbital reconstruction) along with orthognathic surgery. Craniofacial surgery is an important part of all plastic surgery training programs, further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship.

;Hand
Hand surgery is concerned with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome). Hand surgery is an important part of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. The Hand surgery field is also practiced by [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeons]] and [[general surgery|general surgeons]] (see [[Hand surgeon]]). Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. 

;Micro
Microsurgery is generally concerned with the reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels. Popular subspecialty areas are breast reconstruction, head and neck reconstruction, hand surgery/replantation, and brachial plexus surgery.

;Pediatric
Children often face medical issues very different from the experiences of an adult patient. Many [[birth defects]] or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and [[pediatric]] plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include [[craniofacial team|craniofacial anomalies]], cleft lip and palate and congenital hand deformities.

==Plastic surgery obsession==
 
Though media and advertising do play a large role in influencing many people's lives, researchers believe that plastic surgery obsession is linked to psychological disorders.<ref>[http://www.aphroditewomenshealth.com/news/cosmetic_surgery.shtml Obsessed With Beauty: The Rush To Cosmetic Surgery]</ref> [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] is seen as playing a large role in the lives of those who are obsessed with plastic surgery in order to correct a perceived defect in their appearance.

BDD is a disorder resulting in the sufferer becoming “preoccupied with what they regard as defects in their bodies or faces.” While 2% of people suffer from body dysmorphic disorder in the United States, 15% of patients seeing a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeons have the disorder. Half of the patients with the disorder who have cosmetic surgery performed are not pleased with the aesthetic outcome. BDD can lead to suicide in some of its sufferers. While many with BDD seek cosmetic surgery, the procedures do not treat BDD, and can ultimately worsen the problem. The psychological root of the problem is usually unidentified; therefore causing the treatment to be even more difficult. Some say that the fixation or obsession with correction of the area could be a sub-disorder such as anorexia or muscle dysmorphia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=M|title=What is body dysmorphic disorder?|journal=Harvard Mental Health Letter|year=2005|volume=22|pages=8}}</ref>

In some cases, people whose physicians refuse to perform any further surgeries, have turned to "[[self-surgery|do it yourself]]" plastic surgery, injecting themselves and running extreme safety risks.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Canning | first = Andrea | title = Woman's DIY Plastic Surgery 'Nightmare' | pages = | newspaper = ABC News | location = | date = 20 July 2009 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=8080723&page=1 }}</ref>
