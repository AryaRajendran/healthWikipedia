Diphtheria is a contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the [[particulate|aerosolized]] secretions of infected individuals. Historically quite common, diphtheria has largely been eradicated in industrialized nations through widespread [[vaccination]]. In the [[United States]], for example, there were 53 reported cases of diphtheria between 1980 and 2000,<ref name = Pinkbook>{{Cite book| author = Atkinson W, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, Wolfe S, eds. | title = Diphtheria.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:A diphtheria skin lesion on the leg. PHIL 1941 lores.jpg|thumb|A diphtheria skin lesion on the leg]]
The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection.
Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], bluish skin coloration, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling bloodstained nasal discharge and [[lymphadenopathy]].<ref>http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diphtheria/Pages/Symptoms.aspx</ref><ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002575/</ref> Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Mechanism==
Diphtheria [[toxin]] is produced by ''C. diphtheriae'' only when infected with a [[bacteriophage]] that integrates the toxin-encoding genetic elements into the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Victor J Freeman | title = STUDIES ON THE VIRULENCE OF BACTERIOPHAGE-INFECTED STRAINS OF CORYNEBACTERIUM DIPHTHERIAE | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | year = 1951 | pages = 675–688 | pmid = 14850426 | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pmc=386063}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Freeman VJ, Morse IU | title = FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CHANGE TO VIRULENCE OF BACTERIOPHAGE-INFECTED AVIRULENT STRAINS OF CORYNEBACTERIUM DIPHTHERIAE | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | year = 1953 | pages = 407–414 | pmid = 14927573 | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pmc=169283}}</ref>

[[Diphtheria toxin]] is a single, 60,000 [[molecular mass|molecular weight]]  [[protein]] composed of two [[peptide]] chains, fragment A and fragment B, held together by a [[disulfide bond]]. Fragment B is a recognition subunit that gains the toxin entry into the host cell by binding to the EGF-like domain of [[heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor]] (HB-EGF) on the cell surface. This signals the cell to internalize the toxin within an [[endosome]] via [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]]. Inside the endosome, the toxin is split by a trypsin-like [[protease]] into its individual A and B fragments. The acidity of the endosome causes fragment B to create pores in the endosome membrane, thereby catalyzing the release of fragment A into the cell's [[cytoplasm]].

Fragment A inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in the affected cell. It does this by catalyzing [[ADP-ribosylation]] of [[elongation factor]] [[EF-2]]—a [[protein]] that is essential to the translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an [[ADP-ribose]] from [[NAD+]] to a [[diphthamide]] (a modified [[histidine]]) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of [[tRNA]] from the A-site to the P-site of the [[ribosome]] during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.

ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 is reversed by giving high doses of [[nicotinamide]] (a form of vitamin B<sub>3</sub>), since this is one of the reaction's end-products, and high amounts will drive the reaction in the opposite direction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Diagnosis==
The current definition of diphtheria used by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) is based on both laboratory and clinical criteria.

===Laboratory criteria===
* Isolation of ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' from a gram stain or throat culture from a clinical specimen,<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> or
* Histopathologic diagnosis of diphtheria by a stain called "Albert's Stain".

===Clinical criteria===
* Upper respiratory tract illness with sore throat
* Low-grade fever (>{{convert|102|F|C}} is rare)
* An adherent true membrane on the tonsil(s),which may extend to pillars, palate and pharynx(post. pharangeal wall).

===Case classification===
* Probable: a clinically compatible case that is not laboratory-confirmed and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case
* Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is either laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case

Empirical treatment should generally be started in a patient in whom suspicion of diphtheria is high.

==Treatment==
The disease may remain manageable, but in more severe cases, [[lymph nodes]] in the neck may swell, and breathing and swallowing will be more difficult. People in this stage should seek immediate medical attention, as obstruction in the throat may require [[intubation]] or a [[tracheotomy]]. Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to [[heart failure]]. Diphtheria can also cause paralysis in the eye, neck, throat, or respiratory muscles. Patients with severe cases will be put in a hospital [[intensive care unit]] and be given a diphtheria [[antitoxin]]. Since antitoxin does not neutralize toxin that is already bound to tissues, delaying its administration is associated with an increase in mortality risk. Therefore, the decision to administer diphtheria antitoxin is based on clinical diagnosis, and should not await laboratory confirmation.<ref name="Pinkbook"/>

Antibiotics have not been demonstrated to affect healing of local infection in diphtheria patients treated with antitoxin. Antibiotics are used in patients or carriers to eradicate ''C. diphtheriae'' and prevent its transmission to others. The CDC recommends<ref>''The first version of this article was adapted from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] document "Diphtheria - 1995 Case Definition" at http://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/casedef/diphtheria_current.htm. As a work of an agency of the U.S. Government without any other copyright notice it should be available as a [[public domain resource]]''.</ref> either:

* [[Metronidazole]]
* [[Erythromycin]] (orally or by injection) for 14 days (40&nbsp;mg/kg per day with a maximum of 2 g/d), or
* [[Procaine penicillin G]] given intramuscularly for 14 days (300,000 U/d for patients weighing <10&nbsp;kg and 600,000 U/d for those weighing >10&nbsp;kg). Patients with allergies to penicillin G or erythromycin can use [[rifampin]] or [[clindamycin]].

In cases that progress beyond a throat infection, diphtheria toxin spreads through the blood and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications that affect other organs, such as the heart and kidneys. The toxin can cause damage to the heart that affects its ability to pump blood or the kidneys' ability to clear wastes. It can also cause nerve damage, eventually leading to paralysis. About 40% to 50% of those left untreated can die.

Diphtheria is a serious disease, with fatality rates between 5% and 10%. In children under five years and adults over 40 years, the fatality rate may be as much as 20%.<ref name= Pinkbook/> Outbreaks, though very rare, still occur worldwide, even in developed nations, such as [[Germany]] and [[Canada]]. After the breakup of the former [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1980s, vaccination rates in its constituent countries fell so low that there was an explosion of diphtheria cases. In 1991, there were 2,000 cases of diphtheria in the USSR. By 1998, according to [[Red Cross]] estimates, there were as many as 200,000 cases in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], with 5,000 deaths.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol4no4/vitek.htm | title=Diphtheria in the Former Soviet Union: Reemergence of a Pandemic Disease |accessdate= |work= |publisher=CDC, Emerging Infectious Diseases |date=1998-10-01 }}</ref> This was so great an increase that diphtheria was cited in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as "most resurgent disease".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==History==
In 1613, Spain experienced an epidemic of diphtheria. The year is known as "El Año de los Garotillos" (The Year of Strangulations) in history of Spain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=LAVAL|first=Enrique|title=El garotillo (Difteria) en España (Siglos XVI y XVII)|journal=Revista chilena de infectología|year=2006|month=March|volume=23|doi=10.4067/S0716-10182006000100012|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0716-10182006000100012&lng=en&nrm=iso|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> 

In 1659, [[Cotton Mather]] described diphtheria as ''Malady of Bladders in the Windpipe''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diphtheria|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/26802/Diphtheria.html|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> 

In 1735, a diphtheria epidemic swept through New England.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=Boston Gazette|date=March 18, 1735}}</ref> 

Before 1826, diphtheria was known by different names across the world. In England, it was known as ''Boulogne sour throat'', as it spread from France. In 1826, [[Pierre Bretonneau]] gave the name to disease as ''diphtérite'' (from Greek diphthera "leather") describing the appearance of pseudomembrane in the throat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diphtheria|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diphtheria|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> 

In 1856, [[Victor Fourgeaud]] described an epidemic of diphtheria in California.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fourgeaud|first=Victor J.|title=Diphtheritis: a concise historical and critical essay on the late epidemic pseudo-membranous sore throat of California (1856-7), with a few remarks illustrating the diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of the disease|year=1858|publisher=Sacramento : J.

In 1878, [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] daughter [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]] and her family became infected with it, causing two deaths, [[Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]] and Princess Alice herself.

In 1883, [[Edwin Klebs]] identified the bacterium and named it '''Klebs-Loeffler bacterium'''. The club shape of bacterium helped Edwin to differentiate it from other bacteria. Over the period of time, it was called ''Microsporon diphtheriticum'', ''Bacillus diphtheriae'' and ''Mycobacterium diphtheriae''. Current nomenclature is ''Corynebacterium diphtheriae''.

[[Friedrich Loeffler]] was the first one to cultivate [[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]] in 1884. He used [[Koch's postulates]] to prove association between ''Corynebacterium diphtheriae'' and Diphtheria. He also showed that the bacillus produces an [[exotoxin]].

In 1888, [[Emile Roux]] and [[Alexandre Yersin]] showed that a substance produced by C. diphtheriae caused symptoms of diphtheria in animals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parish|first=Henry|title=A history of immunization|year=1965|publisher=E. & S. Livingstone|pages=120}}</ref>

In 1890, [[Shibasaburo Kitasato]] and [[Emil von Behring]] immunized guinea pigs with heat-treated diphtheria toxin. Von Behring won the first Nobel Prize in medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria. Over the Christmas holiday in 1891 in Berlin, the first attempt to cure a person of diphtheria was made. It succeeded. . . . ''It was the first cure''." <ref>John M. Barry, ''The Great Influenza; The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History'' (New York: Penguin Books, c2004, 2005) p. 70.</ref>

In 1895, [[Merck Sharp & Dohme|Mulford Company of Philadelphia]] started production and testing of diphtheria antitoxin in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|first=H. K.

In 1897, [[Paul Ehrlich]] developed a standardized unit of measure for diphtheria antitoxin. This was first ever standardization of biological product and played an important factor in future developmental work on sera and vaccines.

In 1901, thirteen St. Louis children died from contaminated diphtheria antitoxin. The horse from which the antitoxin was derived died of [[tetanus]].

In 1905, Franklin Royer, from Philadelphia’s Municipal Hospital, published a paper urging timely treatment for diphtheria and adequate doses of antitoxin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Royer|first=Franklin|title=The Antitoxin Treatment of Diphtheria, with a Plea for Rational Dosage in Treatment and in Immunizing|year=1905}}</ref> In the same year, [[Clemens Pirquet]] and [[Bela Schick]] described [[serum sickness]] in children receiving large quantities of horse-derived antitoxin.

[[Bela Schick]] developed [[Schick test]] to detect preexistent immunity to diphtheria in an exposed person. Only those who were not exposed to diphtheria were preferably vaccinated. A massive five-year campaign was coordinated by Dr. Schick. As a part of the campaign, 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]] with an appeal to parents to "Save your child from diphtheria." A vaccine was developed in the next decade, and deaths began declining in earnest in 1924.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.healthsentinel.com/graphs.php?id=14&event=graphs_print_list_item | title=United States mortality rate from measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, whooping cough, and diphtheria from 1900–1965 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work= |publisher=HealthSentinel.com |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080508025250/http://www.healthsentinel.com/graphs.php?id=14&event=graphs_print_list_item <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-08}}</ref>

In 1919, at Dallas, Texas, U.S.A., 10 children were killed and 60 others made seriously ill by toxin-antitoxin which had passed the tests of the New York State Health Department. [[Merck Sharp & Dohme|Mulford Company of Philadelphia]] (manufacturers) paid damages in every case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Graham|title=The Hazards of Immunization|year=2002|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group, Limited, 2002|isbn=9780485263190|pages=20}}</ref>

In the 1920s, there were an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 cases of diphtheria per year in the United States, causing 13,000 to 15,000 deaths per year.<ref name= Pinkbook/> Children represented a large majority of these cases and fatalities. One of the most famous outbreaks of diphtheria was in [[Nome, Alaska]]; the [[1925 serum run to Nome|"Great Race of Mercy"]] to deliver diphtheria antitoxin is now celebrated by the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]].

The [[Schick test]], invented between 1910 and 1911, is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria. It was named after its inventor, [[Béla Schick]] (1877–1967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician. 
Alexander Thomas Glenny increased the effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid by treating it with aluminum salts.

In 1943, diphtheria outbreaks accompanied war and disruption in Europe. There were 1 million cases in Europe, with 50,000 deaths.

In 1948, 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization due to improper manufacture of aluminum phosphate toxoid.

In 1974, [[World Health Organization|WHO]] included DPT vaccine [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] for [[Developing country|developing countries]].

In 1975, Seattle reported an outbreak of cutaneous diphtheria.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harnisch|first=JP|coauthors=Tronca E, Nolan CM, Turck M, Holmes KK|title=Diphtheria among alcoholic urban adults.

In 1994, Russian Federation saw 39,703 diphtheria cases. In contrast, in 1990, there had been only 1,211 cases.

In early May 2010, a case of diphtheria was diagnosed in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]] after the devastating [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].
