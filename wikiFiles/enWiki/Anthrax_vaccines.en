'''[[Vaccine]]s''' against the livestock and human disease '''[[anthrax]]''' (caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'') have had a prominent place in the history of medicine, from Pasteur’s pioneering 19th century work with cattle (the first effective [[bacterial]] vaccine and the second effective vaccine ever) to the controversial late 20th century use of a modern product to protect American troops against the use of anthrax in [[biological warfare]]. Human anthrax vaccines were developed by the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1930s and in the US and UK in the 1950s. The current FDA-approved US vaccine was formulated in the 1960s. 

Currently administered human anthrax vaccines include [[acellular vaccine|acellular]] (USA, UK) and [[live spore vaccine|live spore]] (Russia) varieties. All currently used anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general [[reactogenicity]] ([[erythema]], [[induration]], [[soreness]], [[fever]]) and serious adverse reactions occur in about 1% of recipients.<ref>Splino M, et al (2005), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15977694 “Anthrax vaccines”], ''[[Ann Saudi Med]]''; 2005 Mar-Apr;25(2):143-9.</ref> New second-generation vaccines currently being researched include [[recombinant live vaccine]]s and [[recombinant sub-unit vaccine]]s.

==Pasteur’s vaccine==
In the 1870s, the French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822-1895) applied his previous method of immunizing chickens against [[chicken cholera]] to [[anthrax]], which affected [[cattle]], and thereby aroused widespread interest in combating other diseases with the same approach. In May 1881, Pasteur performed a famous public experiment at [[Pouilly-le-Fort]] to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 sheep, one goat and several cows. The animals of one group were twice injected, with an interval of 15 days, with an anthrax vaccine prepared by Pasteur; a [[control group]] was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection, both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the non-vaccinated group died, while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.<ref>{{cite book |author=Decker, Janet |title=Deadly Diseases and Epidemics, Anthrax |publisher=Chelesa House Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=0-7910-7302-5 |pages=27–28 }}</ref> The public reception was sensational. 

Pasteur publicly claimed he had made the anthrax vaccine by exposing the bacilli to oxygen. His laboratory notebooks, now in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris, in fact show Pasteur used the method of rival [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint]] (1847-1890) , a [[Toulouse]] [[veterinary surgeon]], to create the anthrax vaccine.<ref name="cohn">{{cite web | url=http://pyramid.spd.louisville.edu/~eri/fos/interest1.html| title=Pasteur| author=David V. Cohn  location=University of Louisville| date=December 18, 2006| accessdate=2007-12-02| quote=Fortunately, Pasteur's colleagues Chamberlain {{sic}} and Roux followed up the results of a research physician Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, who had reported a year earlier that carbolic-acid/heated anthrax serum would immunize against anthrax. These results were difficult to reproduce and discarded although, as it turned out, Toussaint had been on the right track. This led Pasteur and his assistants to substitute an anthrax vaccine prepared by a method similar to that of Toussaint and different from what Pasteur had announced.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Adrien Loir| title=Le mouvement sanitaire| year=1938| pages=18, 160| chapter-url=A l'ombre de Pasteur}}</ref> This method used the oxidizing agent [[potassium dichromate]]. Pasteur's oxygen method did eventually produce a vaccine but only after he had been awarded a [[patent]] on the production of an anthrax vaccine.

The notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new; this had been known for a long time for [[smallpox]]. Inoculation with smallpox ([[variolation]]) was known to result in far less scarring, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally acquired disease. The English physician [[Edward Jenner]] (1749–1823) had also discovered (1796) the process of [[vaccination]] by using [[cowpox]] to give cross-immunity to [[smallpox]] and by Pasteur's time this had generally replaced the use of actual smallpox material in inoculation. The difference between smallpox vaccination and [[anthrax]] or [[chicken cholera]] vaccination was that the weakened form of the latter two disease organisms had been "generated artificially", so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found. This discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name "[[vaccine]]s", in honor of Jenner's groundbreaking discovery. In 1885, Pasteur produced his celebrated first vaccine for [[rabies]] by growing the virus in rabbits and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue.

In 1995, the centennial of Pasteur's death, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an article titled "Pasteur's Deception". After having thoroughly read Pasteur's lab notes, the science historian [[Gerald L. Geison]] declared Pasteur had given a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort.<ref>See Gerald Geison, ''The Private Science of Louis Pasteur'', Princeton University Press, 1995.

==Sterne's vaccine==
The Austrian-South African immunologist [[Max Sterne]] (1905-1997) developed an attenuated live animal vaccine in 1935 that is still employed and derivatives of his strain account for almost all veterinary anthrax vaccines used in the world today.<ref>Turnbull, PCB,  “Anthrax vaccines: past, present and future”; Vaccine 9: 533, 1991.</ref> Beginning in 1934 at the [[Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute]], north of [[Pretoria]], he prepared an attenuated anthrax vaccine, using the method developed by Pasteur. A persistent problem with Pasteur's vaccine was achieving the correct balance between virulence and immunogenicity during preparation. This notoriously difficult procedure regularly produced casualties among vaccinated animals. With little help from colleagues, Sterne performed small-scale experiments which isolated the "[[Sterne strain]]" (34F2) of anthrax which became, and remains today, the basis of most of the improved livestock anthrax vaccines throughout the world.<ref>Turnbull, Peter, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-max-sterne-1270967.html “Obituary: Max Sterne”]; ''[[The Independent]]'' @ independent.co.uk.

==Russian anthrax vaccines==
Anthrax vaccines were developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and available for use in humans by 1940.<ref>Anaisimova, TI, Pimenov TV, Kozhukhov VV, et al: “Development of method for preparation and maintenance of the anthrax strain STI-1 and test strain Zenkovsky”; In ''Salisbury Medical Bulletin'', Special Supplement #87, June 1996, pg 122.</ref><ref>Shlyakov, EN and Rubinstein E: “Human live anthrax vaccine in the former USSR”; ''[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]]'', 12:727, 1994.</ref> A live attenuated, unencapsulated spore vaccine became widely used for humans.

==British anthrax vaccines==
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}
The widely used British anthrax vaccine — sometimes called Anthrax Vaccine Precipitated (AVP) to distinguish it from the similar AVA (see below) — became available for human use in 1954. This was a cell-free vaccine in distinction to the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine previously used for veterinary purposes.<ref>"[http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/anthrax/downloads/ed-vpd2006-anthrax.ppt Anthrax and Anthrax Vaccine – Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases]", National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, January 2006. (PPT format)</ref> It is now manufactured by the [[Health Protection Agency]]. 

AVP is administered at primovaccination in 3 doses with a booster dose after 6 months. The active ingredient is a sterile filtrate of an [[alum]]-precipitated anthrax antigen from the Sterne strain in a solution for injection. The other ingredients are [[aluminium potassium sulphate]], [[sodium chloride]] and purified water. The preservative is [[thiomersal]] (0.005%). The vaccine is given by intramuscular injection and the primary course of four single injections (3 injections 3 weeks apart, followed by a 6 month dose) is followed by a single booster dose given once a year. During the [[Gulf War]] (1990–1991), UK military personnel were given AVP concomitantly with the [[pertussis vaccine]] as an adjuvant to improve overall immune response and efficacy.

==American anthrax vaccines==
{{main| Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed}}
 
The US undertook basic research directed at producing a new anthrax vaccine during the 1950s and '60s. The product known as [[Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed]] (AVA) — trade name ''BioThrax'' — was licensed in 1970 by the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and in 1972 the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) took over responsibility for vaccine licensure and oversight. AVA is produced from culture filtrates of an avirulent, nonencapsulated mutant of the ''B. anthracis'' [[Vollum strain]] known as V770-NP1-R.<ref name="biothrax">[http://www.fda.gov/cber/label/biopava0131022LB.pdf BioThrax Package Insert]</ref>  No living organisms are present in the vaccine which results in protective immunity after 3 to 6 doses.<ref name="biothrax"/> AVA remains the only FDA-licensed human anthrax vaccine in the [[United States]] and is currently produced by [[Emergent BioDefense Corporation]], formerly known as [[BioPort Corporation]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. In the U.S., the principal purchasers of the vaccine are the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Department of Health and Human Services]].  Ten million doses of AVA have been purchased for the U.S. [[Strategic National Stockpile]] for use in the event of a mass [[bioterrorist]] anthrax attack.

In 1997, the Clinton administration initiated the [[Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program]] (AVIP), under which active U.S. service personnel were to be immunized with the vaccine. Controversy ensued since vaccination was mandatory and a perception developed that AVA was unsafe, causing sometimes serious side effects. Mandatory vaccinations were halted in 2004 by a formal legal injunction which made numerous substantive challenges regarding the vaccine and its safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthrax.mil/documents/library/AnthraxSJtOrder_Op.pdf|title=John Doe #1 v. Donald H. Rumsfeld, et al|date=2004-10-27|format=PDF|publisher=Military Vaccine (MILVAX) Agency|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> After reviewing extensive scientific evidence, the FDA again determined in 2005 that AVA is safe and effective as licensed for the prevention of anthrax, regardless of the route of exposure. In 2006, the Defense Department announced the reinstatement of mandatory anthrax vaccinations for more than 200,000 troops and defense contractors. Despite another lawsuit filed by the same attorneys, the vaccinations are required for most US military units and civilian contractors assigned to homeland bioterrorism defense or deployed in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] or [[South Korea]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/16/AR2006101601084_pf.html Mandatory Vaccine Article] - 'Mandatory Anthrax Shots to Return', Christopher Lee, Washington Post (October 17, 2006)</ref>

{{expand section|date=October 2012}}

==Investigational anthrax vaccines==
A number of experimental anthrax vaccines are undergoing pre-clinical testing, notably the ''Bacillus anthracis'' protective antigen — known as PA (see [[Anthrax toxin]]) — combined with various [[adjuvant]]s such as [[aluminum hydroxide]] (Alhydrogel), [[saponin]] QS-21, and [[monophosphoryl lipid A]] (MPL) in [[squalene]]/[[lecithin]]/[[Tween 80]] emulsion (SLT). One dose of each formulation has provided significant protection (> 90%) against inhalational anthrax in [[rhesus macaque]]s.
*Beginning in 1998 and running for eight years, a secret [[Israel|Israeli]] project known as ''Omer Two'' tested an Israeli investigational anthrax vaccine on 716 volunteers of the [[Israel Defense Forces]].  The vaccine—given under a seven dose schedule—was developed by the [[Nes Tziona Biological Institute]]. A group of study volunteers complained of multi-symptom illnesses  allegedly associated with the vaccine and petitioned for disability benefits to the [[Israeli Defense Ministry|Defense Ministry]], but were denied.  In February 2009, a petition from the volunteers to disclose a report about ''Omer Two'' was filed with the Israel's High Court against the Defense Ministry, the [[Israel Institute for Biological Research]] at Nes Tziona, the director, [[Avigdor Shafferman]], and the  IDF Medical Corps.  Release of the information was requested to support further action to provide disability compensation for the volunteers.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Haaretz Newspaper | title=Defense attempting to block report about anthrax trial | author=Yossi Melman | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1056673.html | date=27 January 2009}}</ref>
