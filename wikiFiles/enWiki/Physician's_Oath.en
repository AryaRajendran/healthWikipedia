Upon a physician's retirement, the "Physician's Oath on Retirement" is being proposed "to address the moral, psychological, social, and cultural responsibilities that a physician assumes when voluntarily relinquishing the responsibilities of active medical practice."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071215/ |title=A Physician's Oath on Retirement |publisher=Pubmedcentral.nih.gov |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>
