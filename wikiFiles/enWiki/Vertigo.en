==Classification of Vertigo==
Vertigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway,<ref name="Hearing loss">{{cite journal|last1=Wippold 2nd|first1=FJ|last2=Turski|first2=PA|title=Vertigo and hearing loss.|journal=AJNR.

===Peripheral===
Vertigo caused by problems with the [[inner ear]] or [[vestibular system]], which is composed of the [[semicircular canal]]s, the [[vestibule]] ([[utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]]), and the [[vestibular nerve]] is called "peripheral", "otologic" or "vestibular" vertigo.<ref name="Medline"/><ref name="Karatas (2008)">{{cite journal|last=Karatas|first=M|title=Central Vertigo and Dizziness|journal=The Neurologist|year=2008|volume=14|issue=6|pages=355–364|pmid=19008741|doi=10.1097/NRL.0b013e31817533a3|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19008741}}</ref> The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ([[BPPV]]), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /> Other causes include [[Ménière's disease]] (12%), [[superior canal dehiscence syndrome]], [[labyrinthitis]] and visual vertigo.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Visual vertigo: symptom assessment, spatial orientation and postural control|journal=Brain|volume=124|issue=8|pages=1646&ndash;1656|year=2001|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/8/1646|doi=10.1093/brain/124.8.1646|last1=Guerraz|first1=M.|pmid=11459755}}</ref>  Any cause of inflammation such as [[common cold]], [[influenza]], and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., [[aminoglycoside]]s)<ref name="aminoglycoside">{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=J|last2=Talaska|first2=AE|last3=Schacht|first3=J|title=New developments in aminoglycoside therapy and ototoxicity.|journal=Hearing research |year=2011|volume=281|issue=1-2|pages=28–37|pmid=21640178|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.05.008|pmc=3169717}}</ref> or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures).  [[Motion sickness]] is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo.

Patients with peripheral vertigo typically present with mild to moderate [[balance disorder|imbalance]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[deafness|hearing loss]], [[tinnitus]], fullness, and pain in the ear.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /> In addition, lesions of the internal auditory canal may be associated with ipsilateral facial weakness.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /> Due to a rapid compensation process, acute vertigo as a result of a peripheral lesion tends to improve in a short period of time (days to weeks).<ref name="Karatas (2008)" />

===Central===
Vertigo that arises from injury to the balance centers of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), often from a lesion in the [[brainstem]] or [[cerebellum]]<ref name="Medline"/><ref name="Emergency"/><ref name="Advances"/> and is generally associated with less prominent movement illusion and [[nausea]] than vertigo of peripheral origin.<ref name="Dieterich (2007)">{{cite journal|last=Dieterich|first=Marianne|title=Central vestibular disorders|journal=Journal of Neurology|year=2007|volume=254|pages=559–568|doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0340-7|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x62437220t306gr6/}}</ref>  Central vertigo has accompanying [[neurological deficit|neurologic deficits]] (such as [[slurred speech]] and [[diplopia|double vision]]), and [[pathologic nystagmus]] (which is pure vertical/torsional).<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /><ref name="Dieterich (2007)" /> Central pathology can cause [[disequilibrium]] which is the sensation of being off-balance. The [[balance disorder]] associated with central lesions causing vertigo are often so severe that many patients are unable to stand or walk.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /> 

A number of conditions that involve the [[central nervous system]] may lead to vertigo including:  lesions caused by [[infarction]]s or [[hemorrhagic stroke|hemorrhage]], [[brain tumor|tumors]] present in the [[cerebellopontine angle]] such as a [[vestibular schwannoma]] or cerebellar tumors,<ref name="Emergency"/><ref name="Hearing loss"/> [[epilepsy]],<ref name="adolescent"/> [[cervical spine]] disorders such as [[cervical spondylosis]],<ref name="Hearing loss"/> degenerative ataxia disorders,<ref name="Emergency"/> [[Migraine|migraine headaches]],<ref name="Emergency"/> [[lateral medullary syndrome]], [[Chiari malformation]],<ref name="Emergency"/> [[multiple sclerosis]],<ref name="Emergency"/> [[parkinsonism]], as well as cerebral dysfunction.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" /> Central vertigo may not improve or may do so more slowly than vertigo caused by disturbance to peripheral structures.<ref name="Karatas (2008)" />

==Signs and symptoms==
Vertigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch080/ch080c.html |title=Vertigo: Dizziness and Vertigo: Merck Manual Home Edition |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  It is commonly associated with [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]],<ref name="adolescent"/> [[balance disorder|unsteadiness]] (postural instability),<ref name="Advances">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037955 | last1=Jahn |first1=K|last2=Dieterich|first2=M| title=Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders.| journal=Journal of neurology |volume=258 |issue=12 |pages=2305–2308|year=2011  |month=December|pmid=22037955|doi=10.1007/s00415-011-6286-4}}</ref> falls,<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21504956 | last1=Vieira |first1=ER|last2=Freund-Heritage|first2=R|last3=da Costa|first3=BR| title=Risk factors for geriatric patient falls in rehabilitation hospital settings: a systematic review| journal=Clinical rehabilitation |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=788–799|year=2011  |month=September|pmid=21504956|doi=10.1177/0269215511400639}}</ref>  and difficulties walking.<ref name="Rehab">{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-35552010000500003&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en| last1= Ricci|first1=NA|last2=Aratani|first2=MC|last3=Dona|first3=F|last4=Macedo|first4=C|last5=Caovilla|first5=HH|last6=Gananca|first6=FF| title=A systematic review about the effects of the vestibular rehabilitation of middle-age and older adults| journal=Revista brasileira de fisioterapia |volume= 14 |issue=5 |pages=361–371|year= 2010 |month=|pmid=21180862}}</ref>  Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and they frequently impair the [[quality of life]].<ref name=Epi09/> [[Blurred vision]], difficulty speaking, a lowered level of [[consciousness]], and hearing loss may also occur.

The characteristics of persistent onset vertigo is indicated by symptoms lasting for longer than one day<ref name="one" /> and caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as we age. Naturally, the nerve conduction slows with aging and a decreased vibratory sensation is common.<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Kaneko|first1=A|last2=Asai|first2=N|last3=Kanda|first3=T|title=The influence of age on pressure perception of static and moving two-point discrimination in normal subjects| journal=Journal of hand therapy: official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists|volume= 18 |issue=4 |pages=421–424|year= 2005 |month=|pmid=16271689 |doi=10.1197/j.jht.2005.09.010}}</ref>
Additionally, there is a degeneration of the [[ampulla]] and [[otolith]] organs with an increase in age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Kutz Jr|first1=JW| title=The dizzy patient.| journal=The Medical clinics of North America |volume= 94 |issue=5 |pages=989–1002|year= 2010 |month=September|pmid=20736108|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.05.011}}</ref> Persistent onset is commonly paired with central vertigo signs and systems.<ref name="one" />

The characteristics of an episodic onset vertigo is indicated by symptoms lasting for a smaller, more memorable amount of time, typically lasting for only seconds to minutes.<ref name="one" /> Typically, episodic vertigo is correlated with peripheral symptoms and can be the result of but not limited to [[diabetic neuropathy]] or [[autoimmune disease]].

===Motion sickness===
Motion sickness is one of the biggest symptoms of vertigo and it develops most often in persons with inner ear problems. The feeling of [[dizziness]] and [[lightheadedness]] is often accompanied by [[nystagmus]] (an involuntary movement of the eye characterized by a [[smooth pursuit]] eye movement followed by a rapid [[saccade]] in the opposite direction of the smooth pursuit eye movement). During a single episode of vertigo, this action will occur repeatedly. Symptoms can fade while sitting still with the eyes closed.

==Differential diagnosis==
A number of specific conditions can cause vertigo.  In the elderly, however, the condition is often multifactorial.<ref name=Epi09/>

===Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo===
[[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder<ref name="Brevern"/> and occurs when loose [[calcium carbonate]] debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion.<ref name="Emergency"/><ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> Patients with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute,<ref name="Emergency"/> which occur with change in position.<ref name="Benign">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm |title=Benign positional vertigo |author=MedlinePlus |year=2011 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> It is the most common process of vertigo.<ref name=Epi09/>  It occurs in 0.6% of the population yearly with 10% having an attack during their lifetime.<ref name=Epi09/>  It is believed to be due to a mechanical malfunction of the inner ear.<ref name=Epi09/>  BPPV may be diagnosed with the [[Dix-Hallpike test]] and can be effectively treated with repositioning movements such as the [[Epley maneuver]].<ref name=Epi09/><ref name="Brazil"/><ref name="Benign"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&pident_articulo=13153812&pident_usuario=0&pcontactid=&pident_revista=495&ty=150&accion=L&origen=elsevier&web=www.elsevier.es&lan=en&fichero=295v25n05a13153812pdf001_2.pdf| last1= Prim-Espada|first1=MP|last2=De Diego-Sastre|first2=JI|last3=Perez-Fernandez|first3=E| title=[Meta-analysis on the efficacy of Epley's manoeuvre in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo].| journal= Neurologia |volume= 25 |issue=5 |pages=295–299|year= 2010 |month=June|pmid=20643039}}</ref>

===Vestibular migraine===
[[Vestibular migraine]] is the association of vertigo and [[migraine]]s and is one of the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo.<ref name=Epi09/><ref name="Brevern"/> The etiology of vestibular migraines is currently unclear;<ref name="Brevern">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22348934| last1=von Brevern|first1=M|last2=Neuhauser|first2=H| title=Epidemiological evidence for a link between vertigo and migraine.| journal= Journal of vestibular research: equilibrium & orientation |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=299–304|year= 2011 |month=|pmid=22348934|doi=10.3233/VES-2011-0423}}</ref> however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the [[trigeminal nerve]] leads to nystagmus in individuals suffering from migraines.<ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> Other suggested causes of vestibular migraines include: unilateral neuronal instability of the vestibular nerve,  idiopathic asymmetric activation of the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, and [[vasospasm]] of the blood vessels supplying the labyrinth or central vestibular pathways resulting in [[ischemia]] to these structures.<ref name="adolescent"/>  Vestibular migraines are estimated to affect 1-3% of the general population<ref name=Epi09/><ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> and may affect 10% of migraine patients.<ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> Additionally, vestibular migraines tend to occur more often in women than in men and rarely affect individuals after the sixth decade of life.<ref name="Brevern"/>

===Ménière's disease===
[[Ménière's disease]] is a vestibular disorder of unknown origin, but is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of [[Endolymph|endolymphatic fluid]] present in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops).<ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> However, this idea has not been directly confirmed with [[Histopathology|histopathologic]] studies but [[Electrophysiology study|electrophysiologic studies]] have been suggestive of this mechanism.<ref name="relentless"/> Ménière's disease frequently presents with recurrent, spontaneous attacks of severe vertigo in combination with ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness), severe nausea or vomiting, imbalance, and hearing loss.<ref name="Emergency"/><ref name="one"/><ref name="relentless">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21474013 | last1= Semaan|first1=MT|last2=Megerian|first2=CA|title=Ménière's disease: a challenging and relentless disorder.| journal=Otolaryngologic clinics of North America |volume= 44 |issue=2 |pages=383–403|year= 2011 |month=April|pmid=21474013|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.010}}</ref> As the disease worsens, hearing loss will progress.

===Vestibular neuritis===
[[Vestibular neuritis]] presents with severe vertigo<ref name=Epi09/> with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and is believed to be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear though several theories have been put forward and the etiology remains uncertain.<ref name="Emergency"/><ref name="Neuritis">{{cite journal|url=| last1=Goddard |first1=JC|last2=Fayad|first2=JN| title=Vestibular Neuritis| journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America |volume=44  |issue=2 |pages=361–365|year=2011 |month=|pmid=|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.007}}</ref> Individuals with vestibular neuritis do not typically have auditory symptoms but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus.<ref name="Neuritis"/> Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected.<ref name=Epi09/>

==Pathophysiology==
The neurochemistry of vertigo includes six primary [[neurotransmitter]]s that have been identified between the three-neuron arc<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/20.long| last1= Angelaki|first1=DE|title=Eyes on target: what neurons must do for the vestibuloocular reflex during linear motion| journal= Journal of neurophysiology  |volume= 92 |issue=1 |pages=20–35|year= 2004 |month=July|pmid=15212435|doi=10.1152/jn.00047.2004}}</ref> that drives the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons, and may modulate [[chemical synapse|synaptic transmission]] in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the [[medial vestibular nucleus]], the connections between the cerebellar [[Purkinje cells]], and the [[lateral vestibular nucleus]], and the vertical VOR.

Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. [[Dopamine]] may accelerate vestibular compensation. [[Norepinephrine]] modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. [[Histamine]] is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. Dopamine, histamine, [[serotonin]], and acetylcholine are neurotransmitters thought to produce vomiting.<ref name="Emergency"/> It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of acute symptomatic vertigo.<ref name="Australia">{{cite journal|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2008/200806/200806kuo.pdf| last1= Kuo|first1=CH|last2=Pang|first2=L|last3=Chang|first3=R| title=Vertigo-part 2-management in general practice| journal= Australian family physician  |volume= 37 |issue=6 |pages=409–413|year= 2008 |month=June|pmid=18523693}}</ref>

==Diagnostic approach==
Tests for vertigo often attempt to elicit nystagmus and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as [[presyncope]], [[hyperventilation syndrome]], [[disequilibrium]], or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness.<ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> Tests of [[vestibular system]] (balance) function include: [[electronystagmography]] (ENG),<ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> Dix-Hallpike maneuver,<ref name="Diagnostic approach"/> rotation tests, head-thrust test,<ref name="Emergency"/> [[caloric reflex test]],<ref name="Emergency"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/oto/studs/vertigo.html |title=Core Curriculum: Inner Ear Disease&nbsp;— Vertigo |publisher=Baylor College of Medicine |date=23 January 2006|accessdate=19 September 2007 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070630173414/http://www.bcm.edu/oto/studs/vertigo.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-30}}</ref> and [[Posturography|computerized dynamic posturography]] (CDP).<ref name="tests">{{cite web |url=http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/diagnosis |title=Diagnosis: How are vestibular disorders diagnosed? |author= |year=2013 |work= |publisher=Vestibular Disorders Association |accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref> [[Computerized tomography|CT scans]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRIs]] are sometimes used by physicians when diagnosing vertigo.<ref name="adolescent"/>

Tests of [[auditory system]] (hearing) function include: [[pure tone audiometry]], speech audiometry, [[acoustic reflex]], [[electrocochleography]] (ECoG), [[otoacoustic emissions]] (OAE), and the [[Auditory brainstem response|auditory brainstem response test]].<ref name="tests"/>
