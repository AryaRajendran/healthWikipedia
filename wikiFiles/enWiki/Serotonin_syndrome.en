'''Serotonin syndrome''' is a potentially life-threatening drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, [[overdose]] of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs. Serotonin syndrome is not an [[idiopathic]] drug reaction; it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonergic activity at [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and peripheral [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> For this reason, some experts strongly prefer the terms '''serotonin toxicity''' or '''serotonin toxidrome''' because these more accurately reflect the fact that it is a form of [[poison]]ing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillman PK |title=A review of serotonin toxicity data: implications for the mechanisms of antidepressant drug action |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=1046–51 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16460699 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.11.016 |url=}}</ref><ref name="Isbister Buckley"/>  It may also be called '''serotonin sickness''', '''serotonin storm''', '''serotonin poisoning''', '''hyperserotonemia''', or '''serotonergic syndrome'''.

The excess serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms including [[cognitive]], [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], and [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] effects. The symptoms may range from barely perceptible to fatal.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM">{{cite journal |author=Boyer EW, Shannon M |title=The serotonin syndrome |url=http://toxicology.ucsd.edu/art%203%20serotonin%20syndrome.pdf|journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=11 |pages=1112–20 |year=2005 |pmid=15784664 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra041867}}</ref> Numerous drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce serotonin syndrome. Diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes observing the symptoms produced and a thorough investigation of the patient's history. The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be mistaken for other illnesses in some people, particularly those with [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. No laboratory tests can currently confirm the diagnosis.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/>

Treatment consists of discontinuing medications which may contribute and in moderate to severe cases administering a [[serotonin antagonist]]. An important adjunct treatment includes controlling agitation with [[benzodiazepine]] sedation. The high-profile case of [[Libby Zion]], who is generally accepted to have died from serotonin syndrome,<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> resulted in changes to graduate medical education in [[New York|New York State]].<ref name="pmid9757752"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptom onset is usually rapid, often occurring within minutes. Serotonin syndrome encompasses a wide range of clinical findings. Mild symptoms may only consist of [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]], shivering, [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[mydriasis|dilated pupils]], [[myoclonus]] (intermittent tremor or twitching), as well as [[hyperreflexia|overresponsive reflexes]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[hyperthermia]]; a temperature as high as {{convert|40|°C|°F}} is common in moderate intoxication. The overactive reflexes and [[clonus]] in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the [[upper limb]]s. Mental status changes include [[hypervigilance]] and [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. Temperature may rise to above {{convert|41.1|°C|°F}} in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include [[metabolic acidosis]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[seizures]], [[renal failure]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Isbister Buckley"/>

The symptoms are often described as a clinical triad of abnormalities:<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Dunkley"/>

* '''[[Cognitive|Cognitive effects]]''': [[headache]], agitation, [[hypomania]], [[mental confusion]], [[hallucinations]],  [[coma]]
* '''[[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic effects]]''': [[shivering]], [[sweating]], [[hyperthermia]], [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]].
* '''[[Somatic nervous system|Somatic effects]]''': [[myoclonus]] (muscle twitching), [[hyperreflexia]] (manifested by [[clonus]]), [[tremor]].

==Cause==
A large number of medications either alone in high dose or in combination can produce serotonin syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Serotonin]] is a [[neurotransmitter]] involved in multiple states including aggression, pain, sleep, appetite, anxiety, depression, migraine, and vomiting.<ref name="Dunkley"/>{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} In humans the effects of excess serotonin were first noted in 1960 in patients receiving a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) and [[tryptophan]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oates JA, Sjoerdsma A |title=Neurologic effects of tryptophan in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor |journal=Neurology |volume=10 |issue= 12|pages=1076–8 |year=1960 |month=December |pmid=13730138 |doi= 10.1212/WNL.10.12.1076|url=}}</ref> The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> It was originally suspected that [[Agonist|agonism]] of [[5-HT receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors]] in [[Periaqueductal gray|central grey]] nuclei and the medulla was responsible for the development of the syndrome.<ref name="Whyte"/> Further study has determined that overstimulation of primarily the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]] appears to contribute substantially to the condition.<ref name="Whyte">{{cite book |last=Whyte| first= Ian M. |chapter=Serotonin Toxicity/Syndrome|title=Medical Toxicology |publisher=Williams & Wilkins| location=Philadelphia |year=2004|pages=103&ndash;6| isbn=0-7817-2845-2}}</ref> The 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor may still contribute through a [[pharmacodynamic]] interaction in which increased synaptic concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Additionally, noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS [[norepinephrine]] concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels appear to correlate with the clinical outcome. Other neurotransmitters may also play a role; [[NMDA receptor]] antagonists and [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] have been suggested as affecting the development of the syndrome.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/>  Serotonin toxicity is more pronounced following supra-therapeutic doses and [[overdose]]s, and they merge in a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose.<ref name="Isbister-JToxClinTox">{{cite journal | author = Isbister G, Bowe S, Dawson A, Whyte I | title = Relative toxicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in overdose | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–85 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15362595 | doi = 10.1081/CLT-120037428}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Whyte I, Dawson A, Buckley N | title = Relative toxicity of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in overdose compared to tricyclic antidepressants | journal = QJM | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–74 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12702786 | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/hcg062}}</ref>

===Spectrum concept===
A postulated 'spectrum concept' of serotonin toxicity emphasises the role that progressively increasing serotonin levels play in mediating the clinical picture as side effects merge into toxicity. The dose-effect relationship is the effects of progressive elevation of serotonin, either by raising the dose of one drug, or combining it with another serotonergic drug which may produce large elevations in serotonin levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillman PK |title=The spectrum concept of serotonin toxicity |journal=Pain Med |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=231–2 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15209988 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2004.04033.x}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

There is no laboratory test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore diagnosis is by symptom observation and investigation of the patient's history.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by [[Harvey Sternbach]], a professor of psychiatry at [[UCLA]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Sternbach"/><ref name="pmid9684919">{{cite journal |author=Hegerl U, Bottlender R, Gallinat J, Kuss HJ, Ackenheil M, Möller HJ |title=The serotonin syndrome scale: first results on validity |journal=Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci |volume=248 |issue=2 |pages=96–103 |year=1998 |pmid=9684919 |doi= 10.1007/s004060050024|url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00406/bibs/8248002/82480096.htm }}</ref> Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better [[sensitivity and specificity]], 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Dunkley"/> As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria were still the most commonly used.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/>

The most important symptoms for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are tremor, [[akathisia]], or [[clonus]] (spontaneous, inducible and ocular).<ref name="Dunkley"/> [[Physical examination]] of the patient should include assessment of [[Stretch reflex|deep-tendon reflexes]] and muscle rigidity,  the dryness of the [[Mucous membrane|oral mucosa]], the size and reactivity of the pupils, the intensity of bowel sounds, skin color, and the presence or absence of sweating.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> The patient's history also plays an important role in diagnosis, investigations should include inquries about the use of prescription and [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] drugs, illicit substances, and [[dietary supplement]]s, as all these agents have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> To fulfill the Hunter Criteria, a patient must have taken a serotonergic agent and meet one of the following conditions:<ref name="Dunkley"/>
* Spontaneous clonus, or
* Inducible clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis, or
* Ocular clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis, or
* Tremor plus hyperreflexia, or
* Hypertonism plus temperature > {{convert|38|°C|°F}} plus ocular clonus or inducible clonus

===Differential diagnosis===

Serotonin toxicity has a characteristic picture which is generally hard to confuse with other [[medical conditions]], but in some situations it may go unrecognized because it may be mistaken for a [[virus|viral illness]], [[anxiety]], [[neurological disorder]], [[anticholinergic]]
poisoning, [[sympathomimetic]] toxicity, or worsening psychiatric condition.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Isbister Buckley"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Fennell J, Hussain M | title = Serotonin syndrome:case report and current concepts | journal = Ir Med J | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 143–4 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16010782}}</ref> The condition most often confused with serotonin syndrome is [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] (NMS).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nisijima K, Shioda K, Iwamura T |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome |journal=Prog Brain Res |volume=162 |issue= |pages=81–104 |year=2007 |pmid=17645916 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(06)62006-2 |url= |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=9780444519269}}</ref> The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features which can make differentiating them difficult.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Christensen V, Glenthøj B | title = [Malignant neuroleptic syndrome or serotonergic syndrome] | journal = Ugeskr Laeger | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–2 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11219110}}</ref> In both conditions, [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] dysfunction and altered [[mental status]] develop.<ref name="Whyte"/> However, they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction (serotonin excess vs [[dopamine]] blockade). Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity.<ref name="Dunkley"/> Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like [[chlorpromazine]] and [[cyproheptadine]]. [[Dopamine receptor]] blockade (NMS) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a [[neuroleptic]] drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as [[bromocriptine]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Whyte"/>

[[Differential diagnosis]] may become difficult in patients recently exposed to both serotonergic drugs and neuroleptic drugs. Features that are classically present in NMS, that are useful for differentiating the two, are [[bradykinesia]] and [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] "lead pipe" rigidity, whereas serotonin syndrome causes [[hyperkinesia]] and [[clonus]].<ref name="Birmes">{{cite journal |author=Birmes P, Coppin D, Schmitt L, Lauque D |title=Serotonin syndrome: a brief review |journal=CMAJ |volume=168 |issue=11 |pages=1439–42 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12771076 |pmc=155963 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12771076}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Isbister GK, Dawson A, Whyte IM |title=Citalopram overdose, serotonin toxicity, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome? |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=657–9 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11582830 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Management==

Management is based primarily on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of [[serotonin antagonist]]s such as [[cyproheptadine]], and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of [[Autonomic Nervous System|autonomic]] instability, and the control of hyperthermia.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sporer K | title = The serotonin syndrome. Implicated drugs, pathophysiology and management | journal = Drug Saf | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–104 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7576268 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-199513020-00004}}</ref> Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with [[activated charcoal]] if it can be administered within an hour of overdose.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/> The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving [[benzodiazepine]]s for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no [[controlled trials]] demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/><ref name="Graudins"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillman PK |title=The serotonin syndrome and its treatment |journal=J Psychopharmacol (Oxford) |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=100–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10221364 |doi=10.1177/026988119901300111}}</ref> Despite the absence of controlled trials, there are a number of case reports detailing apparent improvement after patients have been administered cyproheptadine.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/> Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nisijima K, Yoshino T, Yui K, Katoh S|title=Potent serotonin (5-HT)(2A) receptor antagonists completely prevent the development of hyperthermia in an animal model of the 5-HT syndrome|journal=Brain Res.|volume=890|issue=1|pages=23–31|year=2001|month=January|pmid=11164765 |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03020-1}}</ref> Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a [[nasogastric tube]]; it is unlikely to be effective in patients administered [[activated charcoal]] and has limited use in severe cases.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/> Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering [[atypical antipsychotic]] drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as [[olanzapine]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Critically ill patients should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/>  Patient who have autonomic instability such as low [[blood pressure]] require treatment with direct-acting [[sympathomimetic]]s such as [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], or [[phenylephrine]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting [[antihypertensive]] drugs such as [[nitroprusside]] or [[esmolol]]; longer acting drugs such as [[propranolol]] should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/>

===Agitation===
Specific treatment for some symptoms may be required. One of the most important treatments is the control of agitation with benzodiazepines.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> [[Medical restraint|Physical restraints]] are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric [[muscle contraction]]s that are associated with severe [[lactic acidosis]] and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological [[sedation]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004531/ |title=Serotonin syndrome - PubMed Health |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>

===Hyperthermia===
Treatment for [[hyperthermia]] includes reducing muscle over-activity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More severe cases may require muscular paralysis with [[vecuronium]], [[intubation]], and artificial ventilation.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Isbister Buckley"/> [[Suxamethonium chloride|Succinylcholine]] is not recommended for muscular paralysis as it may increase the risk of cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> [[Antipyretic]] agents are not recommended as the increase in [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]] is due to muscular activity not a [[hypothalamic]] temperature set point abnormality.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/>

==Prognosis==
Upon the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, most cases of serotonin syndrome resolve within 24 hours,<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Isbister Buckley">{{cite journal |author=Isbister GK, Buckley NA, Whyte IM |title=Serotonin toxicity: a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment |journal=Med J Aust |volume=187 |issue=6 |pages=361–5 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17874986 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/187_06_170907/isb10375_fm.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Prator B | title = Serotonin syndrome | journal = J Neurosci Nurs | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–5 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16681290 | doi = 10.1097/01376517-200604000-00005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Jaunay E, Gaillac V, Guelfi J | title = [Serotonin syndrome.
