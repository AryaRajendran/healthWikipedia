'''William Louis Abbott''' (23 February 1860 – 2 April 1936) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician|medical doctor]], [[exploration|explorer]], [[ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[natural history|field naturalist]].  He complied prodigious collections of biological specimens and [[ethnology|ethnological]] artefacts from around the world, especially from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], and was a significant financial supporter of the [[Smithsonian Institution|United States National Museum]] collecting expeditions.

==Early life and education==

Abbot was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="SIA1">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=William Louis Abbott Papers | work=Record Unit 7117, Abbott, William Louis, 1860-1936 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]] | url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217275 | accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref>  He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1881 before studying [[medicine]] there, graduating in 1884 and subsequently doing postgraduate studies in [[England]], obtaining [[licentiate]]s from the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]].  In 1886 he received a substantial inheritance, ceased the formal practice of medicine, and devoted himself to [[exploration]] and collecting.<ref name=Boruchoff1986>Boruchoff, Judith. (1986). ''Register to the William Louis Abbott Collection''. National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution: Washington.[http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fa/abbott.pdf]</ref>

* 1899 - Abbott constructed the [[schooner]] “''Terrapin''” and, using Singapore as a base for the next ten years, travelled throughout the islands of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] often accompanied by [[Cecil Boden Kloss]]. Places visited include the [[Mergui Archipelago]], [[Natuna Islands]], the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]], [[Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], [[Nias]], the [[Mentawai Islands]], [[Enggano Island|Enggano]], the [[Riau Archipelago]] and islands in the [[South China Sea|South China]] and [[Java Sea|Java]] Seas.<ref name=Boruchoff1986/>
* 1909 - The onset of partial [[blindness]], caused by [[spirochaete|spirochetosis]], forced him to sell the “''Terrapin''” and largely suspend his collecting in the [[tropics]].  After treatment in Germany, from 1910 to 1915, he travelled in Kashmir, though making a brief collecting visit to the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Sulawesi]] with his sister in 1914.<ref name=Boruchoff1986/>
* 1916 – [[Dominican Republic]]
* 1917-18 – [[Haiti]], where he suffered a near-fatal attack of [[dysentery]]
* 1919-23 – [[Hispaniola]]

==Post career==
In 1923, Abbott retired from active fieldwork but continued to provide funding on several occasions to the United States National Museum for other collecting expeditions. 

He died at his farm on the [[Elk River (Maryland)|Elk River]] in [[Maryland]] of heart disease after a long illness, leaving his books, papers and 20% of his estate to the Smithsonian Institution.<ref name=Boruchoff1986/>  At the time of his death he was the largest single contributor to the collections of the museum.<ref>Taylor, Paul Michael. (1985). The Indonesian collections of William Louis Abbott (1860-1936): invitation to a research resource at the Smithsonian Institution. ''Museum Anthropology'' '''9'''(2):5-14.</ref>  Abbott’s name is commemorated in the names of numerous animal taxa, including those of [[Abbott's Crested Lizard]] (''Gonocephalus abbotti''), [[Abbott's Day Gecko]] (''Phelsuma abbotti''), [[Abbott's Booby]] (''Papasula abbotti''), [[Abbott's Starling]] (''Cinnyricinclus femoralis''), [[Pygmy Cuckoo-shrike]] (''Coracina abbotti''), [[Abbott's Sunbird]] (''Cinnyris sovimanga abbotti'') and [[Abbott's Duiker]] (''Cephalophus spadix'').  Plants named after him include ''[[Cyathea abbottii]]'', a tree-fern native to Hispaniola.
