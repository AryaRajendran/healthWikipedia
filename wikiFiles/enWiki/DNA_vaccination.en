[[Image:Making of a DNA vaccine.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The making of a DNA vaccine.]]

'''DNA vaccination''' is a technique for protecting an [[organism]] against disease by injecting it with [[genetically engineered]] [[naked DNA|DNA]] to produce an [[immunological response]]. Nucleic acid vaccines are still experimental, and have been applied to a number of [[virus|viral]], [[bacterial]] and [[parasitic]] models of disease, as well as to several [[tumour]] models. DNA vaccines have a number of advantages over conventional vaccines, including the ability to induce a wider range of immune response types.

== History ==

Many believe [[vaccine]]s are among the greatest achievements of modern medicine – in industrial nations, they have eliminated naturally occurring cases of [[smallpox]], and nearly eliminated [[polio]], while other diseases, such as [[typhus]], [[rotavirus]], [[hepatitis]] A and B and others are well controlled. Conventional vaccines, however, only cover a small number of diseases, and infections that lack effective vaccines kill millions of people every year, with [[AIDS]], [[hepatitis C]] and [[malaria]] being particularly common.

''First generation'' vaccines are whole-organism vaccines – either live and [[Attenuated virus|weakened]], or killed forms.<ref name=Alarcon1999>{{cite journal

}}</ref> Live, attenuated vaccines, such as smallpox and polio vaccines, are able to induce [[Cytotoxic T cell|killer T-cell]] (T<sub>C</sub> or CTL) responses, [[Helper T cell|helper T-cell]] (T<sub>H</sub>) responses and [[antibody]] immunity. However, there is a small risk that attenuated forms of a pathogen can revert to a dangerous form, and may still be able to cause disease in [[immunocompromised]] vaccine recipients (such as those with [[AIDS]]). While killed vaccines do not have this risk, they cannot generate specific killer T cell responses, and may not work at all for some diseases.<ref name=Alarcon1999 /> In order to minimise these risks, so-called ''second generation vaccines'' were developed. These are subunit vaccines, consisting of defined [[protein]] [[antigen]]s (such as [[tetanus]] or [[diphtheria]] [[toxoid]]) or [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] protein components (such as the hepatitis B surface antigen). These, too, are able to generate T<sub>H</sub> and antibody responses, but not killer T cell responses.

DNA vaccines are ''third generation vaccines'', and are made up of a small, circular piece of [[bacterial]] DNA (called a [[plasmid]]) that has been [[genetically engineered]] to produce one or two specific proteins ([[antigens]]) from a pathogen. The vaccine DNA is injected into the cells of the body, where the "inner machinery" of the host cells "reads" the DNA and uses it to synthesize the pathogen's proteins. Because these proteins are recognised as foreign, when they are processed by the host cells and displayed on their surface,  the immune system is alerted, which then triggers a range of immune responses.<ref name=Alarcon1999 /><ref name=Robinson2000>{{cite journal

Because the plasmid is the “vehicle” from which the immunogen is expressed, optimising vector design for maximal protein expression is essential.<ref name=Lewis1999 /> One way of enhancing protein expression is by optimising the [[codon]] usage of pathogenic mRNAs for [[eukaryotic]] cells. Pathogens often have different [[AT contents]] than the species being immunized, so altering the [[gene sequence]] of the immunogen to reflect the [[genetic code|codon]]s more commonly used in the target species may improve its expression.<ref name=Andre1998>{{cite journal

Another consideration is the choice of [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]. The [[SV40]] promoter was conventionally used until research showed that vectors driven by the [[Rous Sarcoma Virus]] (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates.<ref name=Alarcon1999 /> More recently, expression rates have been further increased by the use of the [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPV)-CTE with/without rev  increased envelope expression. Furthermore the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic than CTE-alone vector.

=== Vaccine insert design ===

Immunogens can be targeted to various cellular compartments in order to improve antibody or cytotoxic T-cell responses. Secreted or [[plasma membrane]]-bound antigens are more effective at inducing antibody responses than [[cytosolic]] antigens, while [[cytotoxic T-cell]] responses can be improved by targeting antigens for cytoplasmic degradation and subsequent entry into the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class I pathway.<ref name=Robinson2000 /> This is usually accomplished by the addition of [[N-terminal]] [[ubiquitin]] signals.<ref name=Rodriguez1997>{{cite journal

== Delivery methods ==

[[Image:Gene therapy.jpg|thumb|right|DNA vaccine and Gene therapy techniques are similar.]]
DNA vaccines have been introduced into animal tissues by a number of different methods. These delivery methods are briefly reviewed in Table 2, with the advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly used methods summarised in Table 3.

The two most popular approaches are injection of DNA in [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], using a standard hypodermic needle, and [[gene gun]] delivery. A schematic outline of the construction of a DNA vaccine plasmid and its subsequent delivery by these two methods into a host is illustrated at [http://www.sciam.com/media/inline/000052A5-43F6-1CBC-B4A8809EC588EEDF_arch2.gif Scientific American].<ref name=Weiner1999>{{cite journal

The method of delivery determines the dose of DNA required to raise an effective immune response.

Another approach to DNA vaccination is [[expression library]] immunization (ELI). Using this technique, potentially all the genes from a pathogen can be delivered at one time, which may be useful for pathogens which are difficult to attenuate or culture.<ref name=Alarcon1999 /> ELI can be used to identify which of the pathogen’s genes induce a protective response. This has been tested with ''[[Mycoplasma]] pulmonis'', a [[murine]] lung pathogen with a relatively small [[genome]], and it was found that even partial expression libraries can induce protection from subsequent challenge.<ref name=Barry1995>{{cite journal

=== Helper T-Cell responses ===

[[Image:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|right|Antigen presentation stimulates T cells to become either "cytotoxic" CD8+ cells or "helper" CD4+ cells. Cytotoxic cells directly attack other cells carrying certain foreign or abnormal molecules on their surfaces. Helper T cells, or Th cells, coordinate immune responses by communicating with other cells. In most cases, T cells only recognize an antigen if it is carried on the surface of a cell by one of the body’s own MHC, or major histocompatibility complex, molecules.]]
DNA immunization is able to raise a range of T<sub>H</sub> responses, including lymphoproliferation and the generation of a variety of [[cytokine]] profiles. A major advantage of DNA vaccines is the ease with which they can be manipulated to bias the type of T-cell help towards a TH1 or TH2 response.<ref name=Feltquate1997>{{cite journal

(1995)<ref name=Mor1995 /> immunized and boosted mice with pDNA encoding the circumsporozoite protein of the mouse [[malaria]]l parasite ''[[Plasmodium yoelii]]'' (PyCSP) and found that the initial TH2 response changed, after boosting, to a TH1 response.

==== Mechanistic basis for different types of T-Cell help ====

It is not understood how these different methods of DNA immunization, or the forms of antigen expressed, raise different profiles of T-cell help. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection were responsible for the induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence has shown no differences in TH type due to dose.<ref name=Feltquate1997 /> It has been postulated that the type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of [[antigen presenting cells]]. [[Dendritic cells]] can differentiate to secrete [[interleukin|IL]]-12 (which supports TH1 cell development) or IL-4 (which supports TH2 responses).<ref name=Banchereau1998>{{cite journal

==== Practical uses of polarised T-Cell help ====

This polarisation in T-cell help is useful in influencing [[allergic]] responses and [[autoimmune diseases]]. In autoimmune diseases, the goal would be to shift the self-destructive TH1 response (with its associated cytotoxic T cell activity) to a non-destructive TH2 response. This has been successfully applied in predisease priming for the desired type of response in preclinical models<ref name=Robinson2000 /> and somewhat successful in shifting the response for an already established disease.<ref name=Raz1996>{{cite journal

=== Cytotoxic T-cell responses ===

One of the greatest advantages of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes,<ref name=Fu1997>{{cite journal

Cytotoxic T-cells recognise small [[peptides]] (8-10 [[amino acids]]) complexed to [[MHC class I]] molecules (Restifo et al., 1995). These peptides are derived from endogenous cytosolic proteins which are degraded and delivered to the nascent MHC class I molecule within the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER).<ref name=Restifo1995>{{cite journal

=== Humoral (antibody) response ===

[[Image:Antibody.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of an antibody and antigens]]
Antibody responses elicited by DNA vaccinations are influenced by a number of variables, including type of antigen encoded; location of expressed antigen (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted); number, frequency and dose of immunizations; site and method of antigen delivery, to name a few.

==== Kinetics of antibody response ====

Humoral responses after a single DNA injection can be much longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against [[hepatitis B]] virus (HBV) envelope protein (HBsAg) have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza [[haemagglutinin]] has been demonstrated in mice after gene gun delivery.<ref name=Justewicz1996>{{cite journal

Comparisons of antibody responses generated by natural (viral) infection, immunization with recombinant protein and immunization with pDNA are summarised in Table 4. DNA-raised antibody responses rise much more slowly than when natural infection or recombinant protein immunization occurs. It can take as long as 12 weeks to reach peak titres in mice, although boosting can increase the rate of antibody production. This slow response is probably due to the low levels of antigen expressed over several weeks, which supports both primary and secondary phases of antibody response.

Additionally, the titres of specific antibodies raised by DNA vaccination are lower than those obtained after vaccination with a recombinant protein. However, DNA immunization-induced antibodies show greater affinity to native epitopes than recombinant protein-induced antibodies. In other words, DNA immunization induces a qualitatively superior response. Antibody can be induced after just one vaccination with DNA, whereas recombinant protein vaccinations generally require a boost. As mentioned previously, DNA immunization can be used to bias the TH profile of  the immune  response, and  thus  the  antibody  isotype,  which  is  not  possible  with  either  natural infection or recombinant protein immunization. Antibody responses generated by DNA are useful not just in vaccination but as a preparative tool, too. For example, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be generated for use as reagents.

Besides direct transfection of dendritic cells or macrophages, cross priming is also known to occur following IM, ID and gene gun deliveries of DNA. Cross priming occurs when a bone marrow-derived cell presents peptides from proteins synthesised in another cell in the context of MHC class 1. This can prime cytotoxic T-cell responses and seems to be important for a full primary immune response.<ref name=Robinson2000 /><ref name=Torres1997>{{cite journal

}}</ref>

=== Role of the target site ===

IM and ID delivery of DNA initiate immune responses differently. In the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and Langerhans cells take up and express antigen, and are responsible for inducing a primary antibody response. Transfected Langerhans cells migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle, on the other hand, striated muscle cells are most frequently transfected, but seem to be unimportant in mounting an immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are transfected and then initiate an immune response. Transfected myocytes seem to act as a “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.<ref name=Lewis1999 /><ref name=Wolff1992 /><ref name=Torres1997 />

=== Maintenance of immune response ===
DNA vaccination generates an effective immune memory via the display of antigen-antibody complexes on follicular dendritic cells (FDC), which are potent B-cell stimulators. T-cells can be stimulated by similar, germinal centre dendritic cells. FDC are able to generate an immune memory because antibodies production “overlaps” long-term expression of antigen, allowing antigen-antibody immunocomplexes to form and be displayed by FDC.<ref name=Robinson2000 />

=== Interferons ===

Both helper and cytotoxic T-cells can control viral infections by secreting interferons. Cytotoxic T cells usually kill virally infected cells. However, they can also be stimulated to secrete antiviral cytokines such as INF-γ and TNF-α, which don’t kill the cell but place severe limitations on viral infection by down-regulating the expression of viral components.<ref name=Franco1997>{{cite journal

== Modulation of the immune response ==

=== Cytokine modulation ===

For a vaccine to be effective, it must induce an appropriate immune response for a given pathogen, and the ability of DNA vaccines to polarise T-cell help towards TH1 or TH2 profiles, and generate CTL and/or antibody when required, is a great advantage in this regard. This can be accomplished by modifications to the form of antigen expressed (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted), the method and route of delivery, and the dose of DNA delivered.<ref name=Feltquate1997 /><ref name=References1996 /><ref name=Cardoso1996>{{cite journal

* as a mixture of 2 separate plasmids, one encoding the immunogen and the other encoding the cytokine;
* as a single bi- or polycistronic vector, separated by spacer regions; or
* as a plasmid-encoded [[Fusion protein|chimera]], or fusion protein.
In general, co-administration of pro-inflammatory agents (such as various [[interleukins]], [[tumor necrosis factor]], and GM-CSF) plus TH2 inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1 inducing cytokines decrease humoral responses and increase cytotoxic responses (which is more important in viral protection, for example). Co-stimulatory molecules like B7-1, B7-2 and CD40L are also sometimes used.

This concept has been successfully applied in topical administration of pDNA encoding IL-10.<ref name=Daheshia1997 /> Plasmid encoding B7-1 (a ligand on APCs) has successfully enhanced the immune response in anti-tumour models, and mixing plasmids encoding GM-CSF and the circumsporozoite protein of P. yoelii (PyCSP) has enhanced protection against subsequent challenge (whereas plasmid-encoded PyCSP alone did not). It was proposed that GM-CSF may cause dendritic cells to present antigen more efficiently, and enhance IL-2 production and TH cell activation, thus driving the increased immune response.<ref name=Weiss1998 /> This can be further enhanced by first priming with a pPyCSP and pGM-CSF mixture, and later boosting with a recombinant poxvirus expressing PyCSP.<ref name=Sedegah2000>{{cite journal

The advantages of using genetic adjuvants are their low cost and simplicity of administration, as well as avoidance of unstable recombinant cytokines and potentially toxic, “conventional” adjuvants (such as alum,  calcium phosphate, monophosphoryl lipid A, [[cholera]] toxin, cationic and mannan-coated liposomes, QS21, carboxymethylcellulose and ubenimix).<ref name=Robinson2000 /><ref name=Lewis1999 /> However, the potential toxicity of prolonged cytokine expression has not been established, and in many commercially important animal species, cytokine genes still need to be identified and isolated. In addition, various plasmid encoded cytokines modulate the immune system differently according to the time of delivery. For example, some cytokine plasmid DNAs are best delivered after the immunogen pDNA, because pre- or co-delivery can actually decrease specific responses, and increase non-specific responses.<ref name=Barouch1998>{{cite journal

This is because eukaryotes exhibit “CpG suppression” – i.e. CpG dinucleotide pairs occur much less frequently than expected. Additionally, CpG-S sequences are hypomethylated. This occurs frequently in bacterial DNA, while CpG motifs occurring in eukaryotes are all methylated at the cytosine nucleotide. In contrast, nucleotide sequences which inhibit the activation of an immune response (termed CpG neutralising, or CpG-N) are over represented in eukaryotic genomes.<ref name=Krieg1998>{{cite journal

Manipulation of CpG-S and CpG-N sequences in the plasmid backbone of DNA vaccines can ensure the success of the immune response to the encoded antigen, and drive the immune response toward a TH1 phenotype. This is useful if a pathogen requires a TH response for protection. CpG-S sequences have also been used as external adjuvants for both DNA and recombinant protein vaccination with variable success rates. Other organisms with hypomethylated CpG motifs have also demonstrated the stimulation of polyclonal B-cell expansion. However, the mechanism behind this may be more complicated than simple methylation – hypomethylated murine DNA has not been found to mount an immune response.

Most of the evidence for the existence of immunostimulatory CpG sequences comes from murine studies. Clearly, extrapolation of this data to other species should be done with caution – different species may require different flanking sequences, as binding specificities of scavenger receptors differ between species. Additionally, species such as ruminants may be insensitive to immunostimulatory sequences due to the large gastrointestinal load they exhibit. Further research may be useful in the optimisation of DNA vaccination, especially in the food animal industry.

=== Alternative boosts ===

DNA-primed immune responses can be boosted by the administration of recombinant protein or recombinant poxviruses. “Prime-boost” strategies with recombinant protein have successfully increased both neutralising antibody titre, and antibody avidity and persistence, for weak immunogens, such as HIV-1 envelope protein.<ref name=Robinson2000 /><ref name=Letvin1997>{{cite journal

Priming with DNA focuses the immune response on the required immunogen, while boosting with the recombinant virus provides a larger amount of expressed antigen, leading to a large increase in specific CTL responses.

Prime-boost strategies have been successful in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding ''Plasmodium yoelii'' circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone.<ref name=Sedegah1998>{{cite journal

They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to ''P. falciparum'' in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.

=== Additional methods of enhancing DNA-Raised immune responses ===

==== Formulations of DNA ====

The efficiency of DNA immunization can be improved by stabilising DNA against degradation, and increasing the efficiency of delivery of DNA into antigen presenting cells.<ref name=Robinson2000 /> This has been demonstrated by coating biodegradable cationic microparticles (such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) formulated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) with DNA. Such DNA-coated microparticles can be as effective at raising CTL as recombinant vaccinia viruses, especially when mixed with alum. Particles 300&nbsp;nm in diameter appear to be most efficient for uptake by antigen presenting cells.<ref name=Robinson2000 />

==== Alphavirus vectors ====

Recombinant alphavirus-based vectors have also been used to improve DNA vaccination efficiency.<ref name=Robinson2000 /> The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus replicon, replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural replicase genes intact. The Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus have been used to build recombinant alphavirus replicons. Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations, however, alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells, and are only transiently expressed. Also, alphavirus replicase genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it is thought that this may be due to the high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.
