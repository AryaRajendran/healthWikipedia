<!--Definition-->
A '''pulmonary contusion''' (or '''lung contusion''') is a contusion ([[bruise]]) of the [[lung]], caused by [[chest trauma]]. As a result of damage to [[capillary|capillaries]], blood and other fluids accumulate in the lung tissue.  The excess fluid interferes with [[gas exchange]], potentially leading to inadequate oxygen levels ([[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]).  Unlike [[pulmonary laceration]], another type of lung injury, pulmonary contusion does not involve a cut or tear of the lung tissue.

<!--Causes, history-->
A pulmonary contusion is usually caused directly by [[blunt trauma]] but can also result from explosion injuries or a [[shock wave]] associated with [[penetrating trauma]]. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.

<!--Diagnosis, Treatment-->
Diagnosis is made by studying the cause of the injury, [[physical examination]] and [[Chest X-ray|chest radiography]].  Typical signs and symptoms include direct effects of the physical trauma, such as chest pain and [[Hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], as well as signs that the body is not receiving enough oxygen, such as [[cyanosis]].  The contusion frequently heals on its own with supportive care. Often nothing more than supplemental oxygen and close monitoring is needed; however, [[intensive care]] may be required. For example, if breathing is severely compromised, [[mechanical ventilation]] may be necessary. [[Fluid replacement]] may be required to ensure adequate blood volume, but fluids are given carefully since [[fluid overload]] can worsen [[pulmonary edema]], which may be lethal.

<!--Prognosis, Epidemiology-->
The severity ranges from mild to deadly—small contusions may have little or no impact on the patient's health—yet pulmonary contusion is the most common type of potentially lethal chest trauma. It occurs in 30–75% of severe chest injuries.  With an estimated mortality rate of 14–40%, pulmonary contusion plays a key role in determining whether an individual will die or suffer serious ill effects as the result of trauma. Pulmonary contusion is usually accompanied by other injuries.  Although associated injuries are often the cause of death, pulmonary contusion is thought to cause death directly in a quarter to half of cases. Children are at especially high risk for the injury because the relative flexibility of their bones prevents the chest wall from absorbing force from an impact, causing it to be transmitted instead to the lung.  Pulmonary contusion is associated with complications including [[pneumonia]] and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], and it can cause long-term respiratory disability.

Pulmonary contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung tissue. [[Pulmonary laceration]], in which lung tissue is torn or cut, differs from pulmonary contusion in that the former involves disruption of the [[macroscopic]] architecture of the lung,<ref name="Collins07">{{cite book | author=Collins J, Stern EJ | title=Chest Radiology: The Essentials | isbn=0-7817-6314-2 | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year= 2007 | page=120 }}</ref> while the latter does not.<ref name="Wicky00"/> When lacerations fill with blood, the result is [[pulmonary hematoma]], a collection of blood within the lung tissue.<ref name="White991">{{cite book | author=Stern EJ, White C | title=Chest Radiology Companion | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location=Hagerstown, MD | year=1999 | pages=103 | isbn=0-397-51732-7 }}</ref> Contusion involves hemorrhage in the [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] (tiny air-filled sacs responsible for absorbing oxygen), but a [[hematoma]] is a discrete clot of blood not interspersed with lung tissue.<ref name="Moore03">{{cite book | chapter=Trauma to the chest wall and lung | author=Livingston DH, Hauser CJ | title=Trauma.

These conditions do not inherently involve damage to the lung tissue itself, but they may be associated with it.  Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may be associated with lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include [[rib fracture]]s and [[flail chest]], in which multiple ribs are broken so that a segment of the ribcage is detached from the rest of the chest wall and moves independently.

==Signs and symptoms==
Presentation may be subtle; people with mild contusion may have no symptoms at all.<ref name="Costantino06"/> However, pulmonary contusion is frequently associated with [[Medical sign|signs]] (objective indications) and [[symptom]]s (subjective states), including those indicative of the lung injury itself and  of accompanying injuries.

</ref>  This effect is thought to occur microscopically when the pressure in the airways increases sharply.<ref name="Hwang96" />

Contusion usually occurs on the lung directly under the site of impact, but, as with [[traumatic brain injury]], a [[Coup contrecoup injury|contrecoup]] contusion may occur at the site opposite the impact as well.<ref name="Karmy02"/> A blow to the front of the chest may cause contusion on the back of the lungs because a shock wave travels through the chest and hits the curved back of the chest wall; this reflects the energy onto the back of the lungs, concentrating it.

The amount of energy transferred to the lung is determined in a large part by the compliance (flexibility) of the chest wall.<ref name="Karmy02"/> Children's chests are more flexible because their ribs are more elastic and there is less [[ossification]] of their intercostal [[cartilage]].<ref name="Tovar08"/>  Therefore, their chest walls bend, absorbing less of the force and transmitting more of it to the underlying organs.<ref name="Tovar08"/><ref name="Sartorelli04">

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Fluid-filled alveolus.svg|thumb|right|Normally, [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] diffuse across the capillary and alveolar membranes and the interstitial space (top). Fluid impairs this diffusion, resulting in less oxygenated blood (bottom).]]

Pulmonary contusion results in bleeding and fluid leakage into lung tissue, which can become stiffened and lose its normal elasticity.  The water content of the lung increases over the first 72&nbsp;hours after injury, potentially leading to frank [[pulmonary edema]] in more serious cases.<ref name="CohnSM"/> As a result of these and other pathological processes, pulmonary contusion progresses over time and can cause hypoxia (insufficient oxygen).

===Bleeding and edema===
In contusions, torn [[capillary|capillaries]] leak fluid into the tissues around them.<ref name="Fleisher06">{{cite book |chapter=Thoracic trauma |editor=Fleisher GR, Ludwig S, Henretig FM, Ruddy RM, Silverman BK |title=Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2006 |pages=1434–1441 |isbn=0-7817-5074-1}}</ref> The membrane between alveoli and capillaries is torn; damage to this [[Alveolar-capillary barrier|capillary–alveolar membrane]] and small blood vessels causes blood and fluids to leak into the alveoli and the [[interstitial space (biology)|interstitial space]] (the space surrounding cells) of the lung.<ref name="Gavelli02"/>  With more severe trauma, there is a greater amount of edema, bleeding, and tearing of the alveoli.<ref name="ullman03"/>  Pulmonary contusion is characterized by [[hemorrhage|microhemorrhage]]s (tiny bleeds) that occur when the [[alveoli]] are traumatically separated from airway structures and blood vessels.<ref name="Karmy02"/> Blood initially collects in the interstitial space, and then edema occurs by an hour or two after injury.<ref name="Matthay05"/> An area of bleeding in the contused lung is commonly surrounded by an area of edema.<ref name="Karmy02"/> In normal [[gas exchange]], [[carbon dioxide]] [[diffusion|diffuses]] across the [[endothelium]] of the capillaries, the interstitial space, and across the alveolar epithelium; oxygen diffuses in the other direction. Fluid accumulation interferes with gas exchange,<ref name="Bailey06">{{cite book | author=Bailey BJ, Johnson JT, Newlands SD, Calhoun KS, Deskin RW | title=Head and Neck Surgery—Otolaryngology | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location=Hagerstown, MD | year=2006 | page=929 | isbn=0-7817-5561-1 }}</ref> and can cause the alveoli to fill with proteins and collapse due to edema and bleeding.<ref name="Karmy02"/> The larger the area of the injury, the more severe respiratory compromise will be.<ref name="ullman03"/>

===Consolidation and collapse===
Pulmonary contusion can cause parts of the lung to [[consolidation (medicine)|consolidate]], alveoli to collapse, and [[atelectasis]] (partial or total lung collapse) to occur.<ref name="Keough01">{{cite journal |author=Keough V, Pudelek B |title=Blunt chest trauma: Review of selected pulmonary injuries focusing on pulmonary contusion |journal=AACN Clinical Issues |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=270–281 |year=2001 |pmid=11759554 |doi=10.1097/00044067-200105000-00010}}</ref>  Consolidation occurs when the parts of the lung that are normally filled with air fill with material from the pathological condition, such as blood.<ref name="Pryor98">{{cite book |author=Collins CD, Hansell DM |chapter=Thoracic imaging |editor=Pryor JA, Webber BR| title=Physiotherapy for Respiratory and Cardiac Problems |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=1998 |pages= 35 |isbn=0-443-05841-5}}</ref> Over a period of hours after the injury, the alveoli in the injured area thicken and may become consolidated.<ref name="Karmy02"/> A decrease in the amount of [[surfactant]] produced also contributes to the collapse and consolidation of alveoli;<ref name="Moloney08"/> inactivation of surfactant increases their [[surface tension]].<ref name="AllenCox98"/> Reduced production of surfactant can also occur in surrounding tissue that was not originally injured.<ref name="Hwang96"/>

[[Inflammation]] of the lungs, which can result when components of blood enter the tissue due to contusion, can also cause parts of the lung to collapse.  [[Macrophage]]s, [[neutrophils]], and other [[White blood cell|inflammatory cell]]s and blood components can enter the lung tissue and release factors that lead to inflammation, increasing the likelihood of respiratory failure.<ref name="Klein02"/>  In response to inflammation, excess [[mucus]] is produced, potentially plugging parts of the lung and leading to their collapse.<ref name="Karmy02"/>  Even when only one side of the chest is injured, inflammation may also affect the other lung.<ref name="Klein02"/>  Uninjured lung tissue may develop edema, thickening of the septa of the alveoli, and other changes.<ref name="Bastos08"/>  If this inflammation is severe enough, it can lead to dysfunction of the lungs like that seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.<ref name="Sutyak07"/>

===Ventilation/perfusion mismatch===
Normally, the [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|ratio of ventilation to perfusion]] is about one-to-one; the volume of air entering the alveoli ([[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]) is about equal to that of blood in the capillaries around them ([[perfusion]]).<ref name="Prentice94">
{{cite journal |author=Prentice D, Ahrens T |title=Pulmonary complications of trauma |journal=Critical Care Nursing Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=24–33 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=8055358
}}
</ref>  This ratio is reduced in pulmonary contusion; fluid-filled alveoli cannot fill with air, oxygen does not fully saturate the [[hemoglobin]], and the blood leaves the lung without being fully oxygenated.<ref name="Gwinnutt03">
{{cite book |author=Kishen R, Lomas G |chapter=Thoracic trauma |editor=Gwinnutt CL, Driscoll P |title=Trauma Resuscitation: The Team Approach |publisher=Informa Healthcare  |year=2003 |isbn=1-85996-009-X |pages=55–64
}}
</ref> Insufficient inflation of the lungs, which can result from inadequate mechanical ventilation or an associated injury such as flail chest, can also contribute to the ventilation/perfusion mismatch.<ref name="AllenCox98"/> As the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion grows, blood oxygen saturation is reduced.<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/>  Pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, in which blood vessels near the hypoxic alveoli [[vasoconstriction|constrict]] (narrow their diameter) in response to the lowered oxygen levels, can occur in pulmonary contusion.<ref name="Allen96"/>  The [[vascular resistance]] increases in the contused part of the lung, leading to a decrease in the amount of blood that flows into it,<ref name="Bastos08"/>  directing blood to better-ventilated areas.<ref name="Allen96"/> Although reducing blood flow to the unventilated alveoli is a way to compensate for the fact that blood passing unventilated alveoli is not oxygenated,<ref name="Allen96"/> the oxygenation of the blood remains lower than normal.<ref name="Prentice94"/>  If it is severe enough, the hypoxemia resulting from fluid in the alveoli cannot be corrected just by giving supplemental oxygen; this problem is the cause of a large portion of the fatalities that result from trauma.<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/>

==Diagnosis==
To diagnose pulmonary contusion, health professionals use clues from a physical examination, information about the event that caused the injury, and [[radiography]].<ref name="ullman03"/>  Laboratory findings may also be used; for example, arterial blood gasses may show insufficient oxygen and excessive carbon dioxide even in someone receiving supplemental oxygen.<ref name="Keough01"/>  However, blood gas levels may show no abnormality early in the course of pulmonary contusion.<ref name="Strange02"/>

Pulmonary [[ultrasound]], performed at the bedside or on the accident scene, is being explored as a diagnosis for pulmonary contusion.  Its use is still not widespread, being limited to facilities which are comfortable with its use for other applications, like pneumothorax, airway management, and hemothorax.  Accuracy has been found to be comparable to [[CT scanning]].<ref name="Soldati">{{cite journal |author=Soldati G, Testa A, Silva F |title=Chest Ultrasonography in Pulmonary Contusion |journal=Chest |volume=130 |pages=533–538 |year=2006 |pmid=16899855 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/130/2/533 |doi=10.1378/chest.130.2.533 |issue=2}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Prevention of pulmonary contusion is similar to that of other chest trauma.  Airbags in combination with seat belts can protect vehicle occupants by preventing the chest from striking the interior of the vehicle during a collision, and by distributing forces involved in the crash more evenly across the body.<ref name="mlr07"/>  However, in rare cases, an airbag causes pulmonary contusion in a person who is not properly positioned when it deploys.<ref name="Caudle07">{{cite journal |author=Caudle JM, Hawkes R, Howes DW, Brison RJ |title=Airbag pneumonitis: A report and discussion of a new clinical entity |journal=CJEM |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=470–473 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18072996}}</ref>  Child restraints such as carseats protect children in vehicle collisions from pulmonary contusion.<ref name="Cullen01"/> Equipment exists for use in some sports to prevent chest and lung injury; for example, in softball the catcher is equipped with a chest protector.<ref name="Pfeiffer07"/>  Athletes who do not wear such equipment, such as basketball players, can be trained to protect their chests from impacts.<ref name="Pfeiffer07">{{cite book |author=Pfeiffer RP, Mangus BC |title=Concepts of Athletic Training |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2007 |pages=200 |isbn=0-7637-4949-4 }}</ref> Protective garments can also prevent pulmonary contusion in explosions.<ref name="Cooper96"/> Although traditional [[body armor]] made from rigid plates or other heavy materials protects from projectiles generated by a blast, it does not protect against pulmonary contusion, because it does not prevent the blast's shock wave from being transferred to the lung.<ref name="Cooper96"/>  Special body armor has been designed for military personnel at high risk for blast injuries; these garments can prevent a shock wave from being propagated across the chest wall to the lung, and thus protect wearers from blast lung injuries.<ref name="Cooper96"/> These garments alternate layers of materials with high and low [[acoustic impedance]] (the product of a material's density and a wave's velocity through it) in order to "decouple" the blast wave, preventing its propagation into the tissues.<ref name="Cooper96">{{cite journal |author=Cooper GJ |title=Protection of the lung from blast overpressure by thoracic stress wave decouplers |journal=Journal of Trauma |volume=40 |issue=Supplement 3 |pages=S105–110 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8606389 |doi=10.1097/00005373-199603001-00024}}</ref>

==Treatment==
No treatment is known to speed the healing of a pulmonary contusion; the main care is supportive.<ref name="Sutyak07"/>   Attempts are made to discover injuries accompanying the contusion,<ref name="CohnSM"/> to prevent additional injury, and to provide supportive care while waiting for the contusion to heal.<ref name="Sutyak07"/>  Monitoring, including keeping track of [[fluid balance]], respiratory function, and oxygen saturation using [[pulse oximetry]] is also required as the patient's condition may progressively worsen.<ref name="Pryor981">

===Ventilation===
[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|[[mechanical ventilator|Mechanical ventilation]] may be required if pulmonary contusion causes inadequate oxygenation.]]

[[Positive pressure ventilation]], in which air is forced into the lungs, is needed when oxygenation is significantly impaired. [[Non-invasive (medical)|Noninvasive]] positive pressure ventilation including [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), may be used to improve oxygenation and treat atelectasis.<ref name="Sutyak07"/> In both, air is blown into the airways at a prescribed pressure via a mask fitted tightly to the face; in BiPAP the pressure changes between inhalation and exhalation, while in CPAP the pressure is the same during both.<ref name="Sutyak07"/> Noninvasive ventilation has advantages over [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] methods because it does not carry the risk of infection that intubation does, and it allows normal coughing, swallowing, and speech.<ref name="Sutyak07"/> However, the technique may cause complications;  it may force air into the stomach or cause aspiration of stomach contents, especially when [[level of consciousness]] is decreased.<ref name="Moore03"/>

People with  signs of inadequate [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] or oxygenation may need to be [[Tracheal intubation|intubated]]<ref name="Wanek04"/> and [[ventilator|mechanically ventilated]].<ref name="Yamamoto05"/> Mechanical ventilation aims to reduce pulmonary edema and increase oxygenation.<ref name="Allen96"/> Ventilation can reopen collapsed alveoli, but it is harmful for them to be repeatedly opened, and positive pressure ventilation can also damage the lung by overinflating it.<ref name="Dueck06">

Pulmonary contusion or its complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome may cause lungs to lose [[pulmonary compliance|compliance]] (stiffen), so higher pressures may be needed to give normal amounts of air<ref name="Moore03"/> and oxygenate the blood adequately.<ref name="Fleisher06"/> [[Positive end-expiratory pressure]] (PEEP), which delivers air at a given pressure at the end of the expiratory cycle, can reduce edema and keep alveoli from collapsing.<ref name="Tovar08">

</ref>  PEEP is considered necessary with mechanical ventilation; however, if the pressure is too great it can expand the size of the contusion<ref name="ullman03"/> and injure the lung.<ref name="Sutyak07"/> When the compliance of the injured lung differs significantly from that of the uninjured one, the lungs can be ventilated independently with two ventilators in order to deliver air at different pressures; this helps avoid injury from overinflation while providing adequate ventilation.<ref name="Anantham05">

===Fluid therapy===
The administration of [[fluid resuscitation|fluid therapy]] in individuals with pulmonary contusion is controversial.<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/> Excessive fluid in the circulatory system ([[hypervolemia]]) can worsen [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] because it can cause fluid leakage from injured capillaries (pulmonary edema), which are more permeable than normal.<ref name="AllenCox98"/><ref name="Johnson08"/> However, low blood volume ([[hypovolemia]]) resulting from insufficient fluid has an even worse impact, potentially causing hypovolemic [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]; for people who have lost large amounts of blood, fluid resuscitation is necessary.<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/>  A lot of the evidence supporting the idea that fluids should be withheld from people with pulmonary contusion came from animal studies, not [[clinical trial]]s with humans; human studies have had conflicting findings on whether fluid resuscitation worsens the condition.<ref name="CohnSM"/>  For people who do require large amounts of [[intravenous]] fluid, a [[catheter]] may be placed in the [[pulmonary artery]] to measure the pressure within it.<ref name="mlr07"/>  Measuring pulmonary artery pressure allows the clinician to give enough fluids to prevent shock without exacerbating edema.<ref name="Smith98">

</ref>  [[Diuretic]]s, drugs that  increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, can be used when fluid overload does occur.<ref name="KarmyJurk04"/>  [[Furosemide]], a diuretic used in the treatment of pulmonary contusion, also relaxes the [[smooth muscle]] in the veins of the lungs, thereby decreasing pulmonary [[vascular resistance|venous resistance]] and reducing the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.<ref name="Johnson08"/>

==History==
[[File:Morgagni portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]], credited with having first described lung trauma without chest wall trauma]]

In 1761, the Italian anatomist [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] was first to describe a lung injury that was not accompanied by injury to the chest wall overlying it.<ref name="CohnSM"/> Nonetheless, it was the French military surgeon [[Guillaume Dupuytren]] who is thought to have coined the term ''pulmonary contusion'' in the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name="KarmyJurk04">
{{cite journal |author=Karmy-Jones R, Jurkovich GJ |title=Blunt chest trauma |journal=Current Problems in Surgery |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=211–380 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15097979 |doi=10.1016/j.cpsurg.2003.12.004

</ref> With the use of explosives during World War I came many casualties with no external signs of chest injury but with significant bleeding in the lungs.<ref name="EAST06"/>  Studies of World War I injuries by D.R. Hooker showed that pulmonary contusion was an important part of the concussive injury that results from explosions.<ref name="EAST06"/>

Pulmonary contusion received further attention during World War II, when the bombings of Britain caused blast injuries and associated respiratory problems in both soldiers and civilians.<ref name="CohnSM"/> Also during this time, studies with animals placed at varying distances from a blast showed that protective gear could prevent lung injuries.<ref name="CohnZieg96"/> These findings suggested that an impact to the outside of the chest wall was responsible for the internal lesions.<ref name="CohnZieg96"/> In 1945, Burford and Burbank described what they called "wet lung", in which the lungs accumulated fluid and were simultaneously less able to remove it.<ref name="Burford-1945">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Burford | first1 = TH. | last2 = Burbank | first2 = B. | title = Traumatic wet lung; observations on certain physiologic fundamentals of thoracic trauma. | journal = J Thorac Surg | volume = 14 | issue =  | pages = 415–24 | month = Dec | year = 1945 | doi =  | PMID = 21008101 }}</ref><ref name="CohnSM"/> They attributed the respiratory failure often seen in blunt chest trauma in part to excessive fluid resuscitation, and the question of whether and how much to administer fluids has remained controversial ever since.<ref name="CohnSM"/>

During the Vietnam War, combat again provided the opportunity for study of pulmonary contusion; research during this conflict played an important role in the development of the modern understanding of its treatment.<ref name="CohnSM"/>  The condition also began to be more widely recognized in a non-combat context in the 1960s, and symptoms and typical findings with imaging techniques such as X-ray were described.<ref name="CohnSM"/>  Before the 1960s, it was believed that the respiratory insufficiency seen in flail chest was due to "paradoxical motion" of the flail segment of the chest wall (the flail segment moves in the opposite direction as the chest wall during respiration), so treatment was aimed at managing the chest wall injury, not the pulmonary contusion.<ref name="Pettiford07">

</ref> For example, [[positive pressure ventilation]] was used to stabilize the flail segment from within the chest.<ref name="Sutyak07"/> It was first proposed in 1965 that this respiratory insufficiency is most often due to injury of the lung rather than to the chest wall,<ref name="CohnSM"/>  and a group led by J.K. Trinkle confirmed this hypothesis in 1975.<ref name="Bastos08">

</ref>  Hence the modern treatment prioritizes the management of pulmonary contusion.<ref name="EAST06"/>  Animal studies performed in the late 1960s and 1970s shed light on the pathophysiological processes involved in pulmonary contusion.<ref name="CohnZieg96"/>
