The '''2009 flu pandemic''' or '''swine flu''' was an [[influenza pandemic]], and the second of the two pandemics involving [[influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 influenza virus]] (the first of them was the [[1918 flu pandemic]]), albeit in a new version. First described in April 2009, the virus appeared to be a new strain of H1N1 which resulted when a previous triple [[reassortment]] of bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus,<ref>{{Cite journal|date=9 July 2009|title=Geographic Dependence, Surveillance, and Origins of the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus|journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]|volume=361|issue=2|pages=115–119 |pmid=19474418 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0904572 |accessdate=14 May 2010|first1=Vladimir |last1=Trifonov |first2=Hossein |last2=Khiabanian |first3=Raul |last3=Rabadan|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0904572}}</ref> leading to the term "[[swine flu]]" to be used for this pandemic.<ref>{{Cite news|author=From Caleb Hellerman [[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/11/swine.flu.who/ |title=Swine flu 'not stoppable,' World Health Organization says |publisher=CNN |date=11 June 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> Unlike most strains of influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60 years; this was an unusual and characteristic feature of the H1N1 [[pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza|year=2010|title=Clinical Aspects of Pandemic 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=362|location=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]|issue= 18|pages=1708–19|pmid=20445182|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1000449}}</ref> Even in the case of previously very healthy persons, a small percentage will develop [[pneumonia]] or [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).

===Symptoms in severe cases===
The [[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

A November 2009 CDC recommendation stated that the following constitute "emergency warning signs" and advised seeking immediate care if a person experiences any one of these signs:<ref name="CDC_symptoms"/>
;In adults<nowiki>:</nowiki>
:* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
:* Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen
:* Sudden dizziness
:* Confusion
:* Severe or persistent vomiting
:* Low temperature
;In children<nowiki>:</nowiki>
:* Fast breathing or working hard to breathe
:* Bluish skin color
:* Not drinking enough fluids
:* Not waking up or not interacting
:* Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held
:* Flu-like symptoms which improve but then return with fever and worse cough
:* Fever with a rash
:* Being unable to eat
:* Having no tears when crying

Research later indicated that the severe flu effects in healthy young and middle-aged adults are caused by an excessive immune response.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-over-reactive-immune-young-adults-pandemic.html|title=Over-reactive immune system kills young adults during pandemic flu|date=5 December 2010|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref>

==Complications==
Most complications have occurred among previously healthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors. [[Pulmonary]] complications are common. Primary influenza [[pneumonia]] occurs most commonly in adults and may progress rapidly to acute lung injury requiring [[mechanical ventilation]]. Secondary [[bacterial infection]] is more common in children. ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with a high mortality rate. [[Neuromuscular]] and [[cardiac]] complications are unusual but may occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rothberg |pmid=19935413 |first1=MB |last2=Haessler |first2=SD |title=Complications of seasonal and pandemic influenza |pages=e91–7 |issue=4 Suppl |volume=38 |journal=Critical Care Medicine |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c92eeb|year=2010}}</ref>

A United Kingdom investigation of risk factors for hospitalisation and poor outcome with pandemic A/H1N1 influenza looked at 631 patients from 55 hospitals admitted with confirmed infection from May through September 2009. 13% were admitted to a high dependency or intensive care unit and 5% died; 36% were aged <16 years and 5% were aged ≥65 years. Non-white and pregnant patients were over-represented. 45% of patients had at least one underlying condition, mainly [[asthma]], and 13% received antiviral drugs before admission. Of 349 with documented chest x-rays on admission, 29% had evidence of [[pneumonia]], but bacterial co-infection was uncommon. Multivariate analyses showed that physician-recorded obesity on admission and pulmonary conditions other than asthma or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) were associated with a severe outcome, as were radiologically confirmed pneumonia and a raised [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) level (≥{{Nowrap|100 mg/l)}}. 59% of all in-hospital deaths occurred in previously healthy people.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=J.S.

[[Fulminant]] (sudden-onset) [[myocarditis]] has been linked to infection with H1N1, with at least four cases of myocarditis confirmed in patients also infected with A/H1N1. Three out of the four cases of H1N1-associated myocarditis were classified as fulminant, and one of the patients died.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]]|volume=55 |last1=Bratincsák |issue=9 |pages=928–9 |first1=A |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2010.01.004 |last2=El-Said |first2=HG |last3=Bradley |first3=JS |last4=Shayan |first4=K |last5=Grossfeld |first5=PD |last6=Cannavino |first6=CR |title=Fulminant Myocarditis Associated With Pandemic H1N1 Influenza A Virus in Children |pmid=20153131 |date=10 February 2010| laysummary=http://www.modernmedicine.com/modernmedicine/Modern+Medicine+Now/Myocarditis-Linked-to-Pandemic-H1N1-Flu-in-Childre/ArticleNewsFeed/Article/detail/656746?contextCategoryId=40137}} (primary source)</ref>

On 22 June 2010, the CDC announced a new test called the "CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel (IVD)". It uses a molecular biology technique to detect influenza A viruses and specifically the 2009 H1N1 virus. The new test will replace the previous real-time RT-PCR diagnostic test used during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which received an emergency use authorisation from the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in April 2009.

==Virus characteristics==
{{Main|Pandemic H1N1/09 virus}}
The virus was found to be a novel strain of influenza for which extant [[vaccination|vaccines]] against seasonal flu provided little protection. A study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain but that adults, particularly those older than 60, had some degree of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Children showed no [[Cross-reactivity|cross-reactive]] [[antibody]] reaction to the new strain, adults aged 18 to 60 had 6–9%, and older adults 33%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/may2109serum-jw.html |title=Some immunity to novel H1N1 flu found in seniors |last=Schnirring |first=Lisa |date=21 May 2009 |publisher=Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy |accessdate=26 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090923225423/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/may2109serum-jw.html| archivedate= 23 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="CDC_MMWRDispatch_20090421">{{Cite news|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0421a1.htm |title=Swine Influenza A (H1N1) Infection in Two Children – Southern California, March–April 2009 |work=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |date={{Nowrap|21 April}} 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090925183214/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0421a1.htm| archivedate= 25 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> While it has been thought that these findings suggest the partial immunity in older adults may be due to previous exposure to similar seasonal influenza viruses, a November 2009 study of a rural unvaccinated population in China found only a 0.3% cross-reactive antibody reaction to the H1N1 strain, suggesting that previous vaccinations for seasonal flu and not exposure may have resulted in the immunity found in the older U.S. population.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Chen | first1 = H | last2 = Wang | first2 = Y | last3 = Liu | first3 = W | last4 = Zhang | first4 = J | last5 = Dong | first5 = B | last6 = Fan | first6 = X | last7 = De Jong | first7 = MD | last8 = Farrar | first8 = J | last9 = Riley | first9 = S | title = Serologic survey of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, Guangxi Province, China | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1849–50 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19891883 | pmc = 2857250 | doi=10.3201/eid1511.090868 }}</ref>

It has been determined that the strain contains genes from five different flu viruses: North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza and two swine influenza viruses typically found in Asia and Europe. Further analysis has shown that several [[protein]]s of the virus are most similar to strains that cause mild symptoms in humans, leading [[virologist]] Wendy Barclay to suggest on 1 May 2009, that the initial indications are that the virus was unlikely to cause severe symptoms for most people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8028371.stm |title=What scientists know about swine flu |publisher=BBC News |author=Emma Wilkinson |date=1 May 2009|accessdate=26 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090929231136/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8028371.stm| archivedate= 29 September 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In June 2010, scientists from Hong Kong reported discovery of a new swine flu virus which is a hybrid of the pandemic H1N1 virus and viruses previously found in pigs. It is the first report of a reassortment of the pandemic virus, which in humans has been slow to evolve. Nancy Cox, head of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said, "This particular paper is extremely interesting because it demonstrates for the first time what we had worried about at the very onset of the pandemic, and that is that this particular virus, when introduced into pigs, could reassort with the resident viruses in pigs and we would have new gene constellations. And bingo, here we are." Pigs have been termed the mixing vessel of flu because they can be infected both by avian flu viruses, which rarely directly infect people, and by human viruses. When pigs become simultaneously infected with more than one virus, the viruses can swap genes, producing new variants which can pass to humans and sometimes spread amongst them.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Science |date=18 June 2010 |volume=328 |issue=5985 |page=1529 |author=Vijaykrishna D, Poon LL, Zhu HC, Ma SK, Li OT, Cheung CL, Smith GJ, Peiris JS, Guan Y |title=Reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza A virus in swine |pmid=20558710 |doi=10.1126/science.1189132 |bibcode=2010Sci...328.1529V}}</ref> "Unlike the situation with birds and humans, we have a situation with pigs and humans where there's a two-way street of exchange of viruses.

===Transmission===
Spread of the H1N1 virus is thought to occur in the same way that seasonal flu spreads. Flu viruses are spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing by people with influenza. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something – such as a surface or object – with flu viruses on it and then touching their face. "Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way".<ref name="fluandyou">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/qa.htm|title=2009 H1N1 Flu ("Swine Flu") and You|date=10 February 2010|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |accessdate=26 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100304031110/http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Accusations of conflict of interest===
In January 2010, [[Wolfgang Wodarg]], a German deputy who trained as a physician and now chairs the health committee at the [[Council of Europe]], claimed major firms had organised a "campaign of panic" to put pressure on the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) to declare a "false pandemic" to sell vaccines. Wodarg said the WHO's "false pandemic" flu campaign is "one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century". He said that the "false pandemic" campaign began last May in [[Mexico City]], when a hundred or so "normal" reported influenza cases were declared to be the beginning of a threatening new pandemic, although he said there was little scientific evidence for this. Nevertheless he argued that the WHO, "in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and their scientists, re-defined pandemics", removing the statement that "an enormous amount of people have contracted the illness or died" from its existing definition and replacing it by stating simply that there has to be a virus, spreading beyond borders and to which people have no immunity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/swine-flu/story-e6frfkyi-1225818388508|title=Swine flu 'a false pandemic' to sell vaccines, expert says|date=13 January 2010|publisher=[[News.com]]|accessdate=13 January 2010 | first=Chris | last=Pollard| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100114013335/http://www.news.com.au/world/swine-flu/story-e6frfkyi-1225818388508| archivedate= 14 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref>

The WHO responded by stating that they take their duty to provide independent advice seriously and guarded against interference from outside interests. Announcing a review of the WHO's actions, spokeswoman Fadela Chaib stated: "Criticism is part of an outbreak cycle. We expect and indeed welcome criticism and the chance to discuss it".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BL2ZT20100112 |agency=Reuters | title=WHO to review its handling of H1N1 flu pandemic | date=12 January 2010| accessdate= 14 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110326201246/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BL2ZT20100112| archivedate= 26 March 2011| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>Bloomberg http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=ahj0H_RH8U68</ref> In March 2010, the [[Council of Europe]] launched an enquiry into "the influence of the pharmaceutical companies on the global swine flu campaign", and a preliminary report is in preparation.<ref>Paul Flynn, [http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2010/20100329_MemorandumPandemie_E.pdf The handling of the H1N1 pandemic: more transparency needed], memorandum, Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee, The [[Council of Europe]], 23 March 2010 (pdf)</ref>

On 12 April 2010, Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's top influenza expert, stated that the system leading to the declaration of a pandemic led to confusion about H1N1 circulating around the world, and he expressed concern that there was a failure to communicate in regard to uncertainties about the new virus, which turned out to be not as deadly as feared. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan has appointed 29 flu experts from outside the organization to conduct a review of WHO's handling of the H1N1 flu pandemic. She has told them, "We want a frank, critical, transparent, credible and independent review of our performance".<ref name=letter>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/letter_bmj_20100608/en/index.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |author=Chan M |date=8 June 2010 |title=WHO Director-General's letter to BMJ editors|accessdate=30 January 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110130000141/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/letter_bmj_20100608/en/index.html| archivedate= 30 January 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In June 2010, [[Fiona Godlee]], editor-in-chief of the ''[[BMJ]]'', published an editorial which criticised the WHO, saying that an investigation had disclosed that some of the experts advising WHO on the pandemic had financial ties with drug companies which were producing antivirals and vaccines.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fiona Godlee |title=Conflicts of interest and pandemic flu |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=340 |pages=c2947 |year=2010 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2947.full#ref-1|accessdate=21 December 2010|doi=10.1136/bmj.c2947 |pmid=20525680| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101221213507/http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2947.full| archivedate= 21 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO, replied stating, "Without question, the ''BMJ'' feature and editorial will leave many readers with the impression that WHO's decision to declare a pandemic was at least partially influenced by a desire to boost the profits of the pharmaceutical industry. The bottom line, however, is that decisions to raise the level of pandemic alert were based on clearly defined virological and epidemiological criteria. It is hard to bend these criteria, no matter what the motive".<ref name=letter/> In August 2010, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' printed an article stating that "a third of the experts advising the World Health Organisation about the swine flu pandemic had ties to drugs firms" and that of the 20 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which advised the British Government on swine flu, 11 had done work for the pharmaceutical industry or were linked to it through their universities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu advisers' ties to drug firms: Five WHO experts linked with vaccine producers |author=Sophie Borland |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=13 August 2010 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1302505/WHO-swine-flu-advisers-ties-drug-firms-Experts-linked-vaccine-producers.html | accessdate= 10 September 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Fearing a worst-case scenario, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) developed updated guidance<ref name="fluguidance"/> and a video for employers to use as they developed plans to respond to the H1N1 outbreak.

To help avoid shortages of these drugs, the U.S. CDC recommended oseltamivir treatment primarily for people hospitalised with pandemic flu; people at risk of serious flu complications due to underlying medical conditions; and patients at risk of serious flu complications. The CDC warned that the indiscriminate use of antiviral medications to prevent and treat influenza could ease the way for [[drug-resistant]] strains to emerge, which would make the fight against the pandemic that much harder. In addition, a British report found that people often failed to complete a full course of the drug or took the medication when not needed.<ref name=Tami1>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/economy/ap/53932902.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jCd175C5|archivedate=21 August 2009|title=WHO: Healthy people who get swine flu don't need Tamiflu; drug for young, old, pregnant|last=Cheng|first=Maria|date=21 August 2009|work=[[Washington Examiner]]|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref>

===Effectiveness of antivirals questioned===
On 8 December 2009, the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], which reviews medical evidence, announced in a review published in ''[[BMJ]]'' that it had reversed its previous findings that the antiviral drugs [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) and [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) can ward off [[pneumonia]] and other serious conditions linked to influenza. They reported that an analysis of 20 studies showed oseltamivir offered mild benefits for healthy adults if taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms, but found no clear evidence it prevented lower respiratory tract infections or other [[complication (medicine)|complications]] of influenza.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=a9acc7qIJFdU|title=Roche's Tamiflu Not Proven to Cut Flu Complications, Study Says|last=Cortez|first=Michelle Fay|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=11 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=BMJDec8>{{Cite journal|date=8 December 2009|title=Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMJ|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/339/dec07_2/b5106?ijKey=b9e57312b08cf03c1923f6a254048e5d5a08e60d&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|accessdate=11 December 2009|doi=10.1136/bmj.b5106|first1=Tom |last1=Jefferson |first2=Mark |last2=Jones |first3=Peter |last3=Doshi |first4=Chris |last4=Del Mar|volume=339|pages=b5106|pmid=19995812|pmc=2790574}}</ref> Their published finding relates only to its use in healthy adults with influenza; they say nothing about its use in patients judged to be at high risk of complications (pregnant women, children under five and those with underlying medical conditions), and uncertainty over its role in reducing complications in healthy adults may still leave it as a useful drug for reducing the duration of symptoms.

Some specific results from the ''BMJ'' article include: "The efficacy of oral oseltamivir against symptomatic laboratory confirmed influenza was 61% (risk ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.85) at {{Nowrap|75 mg}} daily&nbsp;... The remaining evidence suggests oseltamivir did not reduce influenza related lower respiratory tract complications (risk ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 1.35)".<ref name=BMJDec8/> Notice especially the wide range for this second result.

The initial outbreak received a week of near-constant media attention. [[Epidemiologist]]s cautioned that the number of cases reported in the early days of an outbreak can be very inaccurate and deceptive due to several causes, among them [[selection bias]], [[media bias]] and incorrect reporting by governments. Inaccuracies could also be caused by authorities in different countries looking at differing population groups. Furthermore, countries with poor health care systems and older laboratory facilities may take longer to identify or report cases.<ref>{{Cite news |agency=[[Reuters]] |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm |title=GLOBAL: No A (H1N1) cases – reality or poor lab facilities? |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090511130411/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> "[E]ven in developed countries the [numbers of flu deaths] are uncertain, because medical authorities don't usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu-like illness".<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Peter M. |last1=Sandman |first2=Jody |last2=Lanard|year=2005|title=Bird Flu: Communicating the Risk|journal=Perspectives in Health Magazine|volume=10|issue=2|url=http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/Number22_article1a.htm| accessdate= 14 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Dr. Joseph S.

===Followup===
A Wisconsin study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in September 2010, reported that findings showed that the 2009 H1N1 flu was no more severe than the seasonal flu. "The risk of most serious complications was not elevated in adults or children", the study's authors wrote. "Children were disproportionately affected by 2009 H1N1 infection, but the perceived severity of symptoms and risk of serious outcomes were not increased." Children infected in the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic were no more likely to be hospitalized with complications or get pneumonia than those who catch seasonal strains. About 1.5% of children with the H1N1 swine flu strain were hospitalized within 30 days, compared with 3.7% of those sick with a seasonal strain of H1N1 and 3.1% with an H3N2 virus.<ref>{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Tom |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-07/swine-flu-in-children-is-no-more-severe-than-seasonal-virus-study-finds.html |title=Swine Flu Found No More Severe Than Seasonal Virus |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 September 2010 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>

CDC illness and death estimates from April 2009 to April 2010, are as follows:
* CDC estimates that between 43&nbsp;million and 89&nbsp;million cases of 2009 H1N1 occurred between April 2009 and 10 April 2010. The mid-level in this range is about 61&nbsp;million people infected with 2009 H1N1.
* CDC estimates that between about 195,000 and 403,000 H1N1-related hospitalizations occurred between April 2009 and 10 April 2010. The mid-level in this range is about 274,000 2009 H1N1-related hospitalizations.
* CDC estimates that between about 8,870 and 18,300 2009 H1N1-related deaths occurred between April 2009 and 10 April 2010. The mid-level in this range is about 12,470 2009 H1N1-related deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm |title=Updated CDC Estimates of 2009 H1N1 Influenza Cases, Hospitalizations and Deaths in the United States, April 2009 – April 10, 2010 |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>

It is often stated that about 36,000 die from the seasonal flu in the U.S. each year,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mason |first=Michael |url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html |title=Flu – Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment of Flu – NY Times Health Information |publisher=Health.nytimes.com |accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref> and this is frequently understood as an indication that the H1N1 strain was not as severe as seasonal influenza. The 36,000 estimate was presented in a 2003 study by CDC scientists published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' but only refers to a period from 1990-91 through 1998-99. During those years, the number of estimated deaths ranged from 17,000 to 52,000, with an average of about 36,000. The ''JAMA'' study also looked at seasonal influenza-associated deaths over a 23 year period, from 1976-1977 and 1998-1999. During that period, estimates of respiratory and circulatory influenza-associated deaths ranged from about 5,000 to about 52,000, with an average of about 25,000. While the 36,000 number is often cited, it's important to note that during that decade, influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus during most of the seasons, and H3N2 influenza viruses are typically associated with higher death rates. CDC believes that the range of deaths over the past 31 years (~3,000 to ~49,000) is a more accurate representation of the unpredictability and variability of flu-associated deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm#how-many-die |title=CDC - Seasonal Influenza (Flu) - Questions and Answers Regarding Estimating Deaths from Influenza in the United States |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> The annual toll from seasonal influenza in the US is more accurately estimated at 3000-49,000 deaths per year. So the H1N1 pandemic estimated mortality of 8,870 to 18,300, places it in the mid-range of estimates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flu.gov/individualfamily/about/h1n1/estimates_2009_h1n1.html#The%20Numbers |title=CDC Estimates of 2009 H1N1 Influenza Cases, Hospitalizations and Deaths in the United States, April – November 14, 2009 |publisher=Flu.gov |date= |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref>

The 2009 pandemic caused hospitals around the country to make significant preparations in terms of hospital surge capacities, especially within the emergency department and among vulnerable populations.  In many cases, hospitals were relatively successful in making sure that those patients most severely affected by the influenza strain were able to be seen, treated, and discharged in an efficient manner.  A proper case-study of the preparation, planning, mitigation, and response efforts during the Fall of 2009 is that of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  For example, CHOP took several steps to increase the emergency department (ED) surge capacity response abilities through careful planning and mitigation efforts.  To increase ED capacity and response, CHOP used portions of the main lobby area as an ED waiting room; several of the region's hospital-based outpatient facilities were in use during evening and weekend hours for non-emergent cases; the ED's 24-hour short-stay unit was utilized to care for ED patients in a longer-term capacity; non-board certified physicians (in pediatric emergency medicine) and inpatient-unit medical nurses were utilized for ED patient care; hospital units normally utilized for other medical or therapeutic purposes were transformed into ED patient rooms; and rooms normally used for only one patient were expanded to at least a capacity of 2<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scarfone|first=Dr. Richard J.|coauthors=Dr. Susan Coffin, Dr. Evan S.

People who contracted flu before 1957 appeared to have some immunity to H1N1 flu. Dr. Daniel Jernigan, head of flu epidemiology for the U.S. CDC, has stated: "Tests on [[blood serum]] from older people showed that they had [[antibodies]] that attacked the new virus&nbsp;... That does not mean that everyone over 52 is immune, since Americans and Mexicans older than that have died of the new flu".<ref name="Don McNeil, 20 May">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/health/21swineflu.html |title=U.S. Says Older People Appear Safer From New Flu Strain |work=The New York Times |last=McNeil Jr. |first=Donald G. |date=20 May 2009|accessdate=26 September 2009}}</ref>
