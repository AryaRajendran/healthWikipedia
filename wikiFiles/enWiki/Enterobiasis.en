A '''pinworm infection''' or '''enterobiasis''' is a [[human parasitic disease]] and one of the most common childhood [[parasitic worm]] infections in the developed world.<ref name="cook2009p1515">[[#cook2009|Cook et al. 2009]], p. 1515</ref><ref name="britannica">[[#britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref> It is caused by infestation of the parasitic roundworm ''[[Enterobius vermicularis]]'', commonly called the human ''pinworm''.<ref name="icd">[[#icd|WHO: ICD 2007]]</ref> Infection usually occurs through the ingestion of pinworm eggs, either through [[contamination|contaminated]] hands, food, or less commonly, water.<ref name="cook1994p1159" />  The chief symptom is [[itch]]ing in the [[anus|anal]] area.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The [[incubation time]] from ingestion of eggs to the first appearance of new eggs around the anus is 4 to 6 weeks.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /> Pinworms are usually considered a nuisance rather than a serious disease.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> Treatment is straightforward in uncomplicated cases, however, elimination of the parasite from a family group or institution often poses significant problems—either due to an incomplete cure or reinfection.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> Pinworm infection has no association with any socioeconomic level, race or culture.<ref name="burkhart2005p837">[[#burkhart2005|Burkhart & burkhart 2005]], p. 837</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
One third of individuals with pinworm infection are totally [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /> The main symptoms are [[pruritus ani]] and [[perineum|perineal]] [[pruritus]], i.e., [[itch]]ing in and around the anus and around the [[perineum]].<ref name="burkhart2005p838">[[#burkhart2005|Burkhart & burkhart 2005]], p. 838</ref><ref name="cook2009p1516">[[#cook2009|Cook et al. 2009]], p. 1516</ref><ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> The itching occurs mainly during the night,<ref name="cook2009p1516" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307">[[#caldwell1982|Caldwell 1982]], p. 307.</ref> and is caused by the female pinworms migrating to lay eggs around the anus.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> Both the migrating females and the clumps of eggs are irritating, but the mechanisms causing the intense [[pruritus]] have not been explained.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" />  The intensity of the itching varies, and it can be described as [[tickling]], crawling sensations, or even [[acute pain]].<ref name="cook1994p1160">[[#cook1994|Cook 1994]], p. 1160</ref> The itching leads to continuously scratching the area around the anus, which can further result in tearing of the skin and complications such as [[secondary infection|secondary bacterial infections]], including [[bacterial]] [[dermatitis]] (i.e., skin inflammation) and [[folliculitis]] (i.e., hair follicle inflammation).<ref name="cook2009p1516" /><ref name="gutierrez2000p355">[[#gutierrez2000|Gutiérrez 2005]], p. 355.</ref><ref name="cook1994p1160" /> General symptoms are [[insomnia]] (i.e., persistent difficulties to sleep) and [[psychomotor agitation|restlessness]].<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> A considerable proportion of children suffer from [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (i.e., loss of appetite), [[weight loss]], [[irritability]], emotional instability, and [[enuresis]] (i.e., inability to control [[urination]]).<ref name="cook2009p1516" />

Pinworms cannot damage the skin,<ref name="gutierrez2000p356">[[#gutierrez2000|Gutiérrez 2005]], p. 356.</ref> and they do not normally migrate through [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> However, in women they may move onto the [[vulva]] and into the [[vagina]], from there moving to [[external orifice of the uterus]], and onwards to the [[uterine cavity]], [[fallopian tubes]], [[ovaries]], and [[peritoneal cavity]].<ref name="gutierrez2000p356" /> This can cause [[vulvovaginitis]], i.e. an inflammation of the vulva and vagina.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /><ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> This causes [[vaginal discharge]] and [[pruritus vulvae]], i.e., [[itch]]iness of the vulva.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> The pinworms can also enter the [[urethra]], and presumably, they carry intestinal bacteria with them.<ref name="gutierrez2000p356" /> According to Gutierrez (2000), a statistically significant correlation between pinworm infection and [[urinary tract infection]]s has been shown,<ref name="gutierrez2000p356" /> however  Burkhart & Burkhart (2005) maintain that the incidence of pinworms as a cause of urinary tract infections remains unknown.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /> Incidentally, one report indicated that 36% of young girls with [[urinary tract infection]] also had pinworms.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /> [[Dysuria]] (i.e., painful [[urination]]) has been associated with pinworm infection.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" />

The relationship between pinworm infestation and [[appendicitis]] has been researched, but there is a lack of clear consensus in the matter: while Gutierres (2005) maintains that there exists a consensus that pinworms do not produce the inflammatory reaction,<ref name="gutierrez2000p363" /> Cook (1994) states that it is controversial whether pinworms are causatively related to [[acute appendicitis]],<ref name="cook1994p1160" /> and Burkhart & Burkhart (2004) state that pinworm infection causes symptoms of appendicitis to surface.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" />

==Cause==
{{Main|Enterobius}}
[[File:Enterobius vermicularis LifeCycle.gif|thumb|Pinworm life cycle.]]

The cause of a pinworm infection is the worm ''[[Enterobius vermicularis]]''.  The entire lifecycle &mdash; from egg to adult &mdash; takes place in the [[human gastrointestinal tract]] of a single human host.<ref name="cook1994p1159">[[#cook1994|Cook 1994]], p. 1159</ref><ref name="gutierrez2000p354">[[#gutierrez2000|Gutiérrez 2005]], p. 354.</ref> Cook ''et al.'' (2009) and Burkhart & Burkhart (2005) disagree over the length of this process, with Cook ''et al.'' stating two to four weeks,<ref name="cook2009p1516"/> while Burkhart & Burkhart states that it takes from four to eight weeks.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" />

The lifecycle begins with eggs being [[ingestion|ingested]].<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The eggs hatch in the [[duodenum]] (i.e., first part of the [[small intestine]]).<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The emerging pinworm [[larva]]e grow rapidly to a size of 140 to 150 micrometers in size,<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> and migrate through the small intestine towards the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> During this migration they [[moult]] twice and become adults.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Females survive for 5 to 13 weeks, and males about 7 weeks.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The male and female pinworms mate in the [[ileum]] (i.e., last part of the small intestine),<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> whereafter the male pinworms usually die,<ref name="garcia1999p246">[[#garcia1999|Garcia 1999]], p. 246</ref> and are passed out with stool.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" />  The gravid female pinworms settle in the [[ileum]], [[caecum]] (i.e., beginning of the [[large intestine]]), [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and [[ascending colon]],<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> where they attach themselves to the [[mucosa]]<ref name="burkhart2005p837"/>  and ingest colonic contents.<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> Almost the entire body of a [[gravid]] female becomes filled with eggs.<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The estimations of the number of eggs in a gravid female pinworm ranges from about 11,000<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> to 16,000.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> The egg-laying process begins approximately five weeks after initial ingestion of pinworm eggs by the human host.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> The gravid female pinworms migrate through the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] towards the [[rectum]] at a rate of 12 to 14 centimeters per hour.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> They emerge from the [[anus]], and while moving on the skin near the anus, the female pinworms deposit eggs either through (1) contracting and expelling the eggs, (2) dying and then disintegrating, or (3) bodily rupture due to the host scratching the worm.<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> After depositing the eggs, the female becomes [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and dies.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> The reason the female emerges from the anus is to obtain the oxygen necessary for the maturation of the eggs.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" />

Pinworm infection spreads through human-to-human [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], by [[ingesting]] (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The eggs are hardy and can remain viable (i.e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still viable after 18 hours at &minus;8 degrees Celsius (18 °F).<ref name="caldwell1982p307" />

After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through [[contamination]].<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid,<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> From here, eggs are further transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom [[plumbing fixture|fixtures]] and other objects.<ref name="cook1994p1159" /><ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected.<ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307" /><ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="cook2009p1516" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host,<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal [[mucosa]], and migrate up the [[bowel]] and back into the [[gastrointestinal tract]] of the original host.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="cook2009p1516" /> This process is called ''retroinfection''.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /><ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> According to Burkhart (2005), when this retroinfection occurs, it leads to a heavy [[parasitic]] load and ensures that the pinworm infestation continues.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> This statement is contradictory to a statement by Caldwelli (1982), who contends that retroinfection is rare and not clinically significant.<ref name="caldwell1982p307" /> Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms,<ref name="cook1994p1159" /> [[autoinfection]] (i.e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" />

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Pinworms in the Appendix (2).jpg|thumb|High magnification [[micrograph]] of a pinworm in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] in the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
Diagnosis depends on finding the eggs or the adult pinworms.<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Individual eggs are invisible to the naked eye, but they can be seen using a low-power [[microscope]].<ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> On the other hand, the light-yellowish thread-like adult pinworms are clearly visually detectable, usually during the night when they move near the anus, or on toilet paper.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /><ref name="cook1994p1160" /><ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> Transparent [[adhesive tape]] (e.g. [[Scotch Tape]]) applied on the anal area will pick up deposited eggs, and diagnosis can be made by examining the tape with a microscope.<ref name="gutierrez2000p363">[[#gutierrez2000|Gutiérrez 2005]], p. 363.</ref><ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> This test is most successful if done every morning for several days, because the females do not lay eggs every day, and the number of eggs vary.<ref name="caldwell1982p308" />

Pinworms do not lay eggs in the [[human feces|feces]],<ref name="caldwell1982p308">[[#caldwell1982|Caldwell 1982]], p. 308.</ref> but sometimes eggs are deposited in the intestine.<ref name="garcia1999p246" />  As such, routine examination of fecal material gives a positive diagnosis in only 5 to 15% of infected subjects,<ref name="cook1994p1160" /> and is therefore of little practical diagnostic use.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> In a heavy infection, female pinworms may adhere to [[human feces|stools]] that pass out through the anus, and they may thus be detected on the surface on the stool.<ref name="cook1994p1160" /><ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Adult pinworms are occasionally seen during [[colonoscopy]].<ref name="cook1994p1160" /> On a microscopic level, pinworms have an identifying feature of [[alae (anatomy)|alae]] (i.e., protruding ridges) running the length of the worm.<ref name="dpdx">[[#dpdx|dpdx 2009]]</ref>

==Prevention==
Pinworm infection cannot be totally prevented under most circumstances.<ref name="garcia1999p247">[[#garcia1999|Garcia 1999]], p. 247</ref> This is due to the prevalence of the parasite and the ease of transmission through soiled night clothes, airborne eggs, contaminated furniture, toys and other objects.<ref name="garcia1999p246" /> Infection may occur in the highest strata of society, where hygiene and [[nutrition]]al status are typically high.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> The stigma associated with pinworm infection is hence considered a possible over-emphasis.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> [[Counselling]] is sometimes needed for upset parents that have discovered their children are infected, as they may not realize how prevalent the infection is.<ref name="garcia1999p246" />

Preventative action revolves around [[personal hygiene]] and the cleanliness of the living quarters.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> The ''rate'' of reinfection can be reduced through hygienic measures, and this is recommended especially in recurring cases.<ref name="caldwell1982p308" /><ref name="cook1994p1161" />
The main measures are keeping fingernails short, and washing and scrubbing hands and fingers carefully, especially after [[defecation]] and before meals.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /><ref name="caldwell1982p309" /> Under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and hand towels should be changed daily.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> Children should wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> Food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> Household [[detergents]] have little effect on the viability of pinworm eggs, and cleaning the bathroom with a damp cloth moistened with an [[antibacterial agent]] or [[bleach]] will merely spread the still-viable eggs.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> Similarly, shaking clothes and bed linen will detach and spread the eggs.<ref name="cook1994p1161" />

==Treatment==

[[Medication]] is the primary treatment for pinworm infection.<ref name="cook1994p1161">[[#cook1994|Cook 1994]], p. 1161</ref> The existing pharmaceutical drugs against pinworms are so effective that many medical scientists regard hygienic measures as impractical.<ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> However, reinfection is frequent regardless of the medication used.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /> Total elimination of the parasite in a household may require repeated doses of medication for up to a year or more.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> Because the drugs kill the adult pinworms, but not the eggs, the first retreatment is recommended in two weeks.<ref name="caldwell1982p308" /> Also, if one household member spreads the eggs to another, it will be a matter of two or three weeks before those eggs become adult worms and thus amenable to treatment.<ref name="caldwell1982p309">[[#caldwell1982|Caldwell 1982]], p. 309.</ref> [[Asymptomatic]] infections, often in small children, can serve as reservoirs of infection, and therefore the entire household should be treated regardless of whether or not symptoms are present.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /><ref name="cook1994p1161" />

The [[benzimidazole]] compounds [[albendazole]] ([[brand name]]s e.g., ''Albenza'', ''Eskazole'', ''Zentel'' and ''Andazol'') and [[mebendazole]] ([[brand name]]s e.g., ''Ovex'', ''Vermox'', ''Antiox'' and ''Pripsen'') are the most effective.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> They work by inhibiting the [[microtubule]] function in the pinworm adults, causing [[glycogen]] depletion,<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> thereby effectively starving the parasite.<ref name="caldwell1982p309" /> A single 100 milligram dose of [[mebendazole]]  with one repetition after a week, is considered the safest, and is usually effective with cure rate of 96%.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" /><ref name="cook1994p1161" /> Mebendazole has no serious [[side effects]], although [[abdominal pain]] and [[diarrhea]] have been reported.<ref name="cook1994p1161" /> [[Pyrantel pamoate]] (also called pyrantel embonate, [[brand name]]s e.g., ''Reese's Pinworm Medicine'', ''Pin-X'', ''Combantrin'', ''Anthel'', ''Helmintox'', and ''Helmex'') kills adult pinworms through [[neuromuscular blockade]],<ref name="caldwell1982p309" /> and is considered as effective as the [[benzimidazole]] compounds.<ref name="cook2009p1516" /> Other medications are [[piperazine]], which causes [[flaccid paralysis]] in the adult pinworms, and [[pyrvinium pamoate]] (also called pyrvinium embonate), which works by inhibiting [[oxygen]] uptake of the adult pinworms.<ref name="caldwell1982p309" /> Pinworms located in the [[genitourinary system]] (in this case, female genital area) may require other drug treatments.<ref name="burkhart2005p838" />

A pinworm infection can also be treated using home made remedies and the most common ingredients used are tea tree oil, garlic, papaya seeds, and pumpkin seeds. Usually smashed garlic cloves and tea tree oil mixture are applied (over isolation layer like vaseline) around the anus to kill the female pinworms and destroy the eggs.<ref>http://www.pinworms.co/treatments-for-pinworms/</ref><ref>http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15625/1/Home-Remedies-for-Pinworms.html</ref>

==Epidemiology==

Pinworm infection occurs worldwide,<ref name="gutierrez2000p355"/> and is the most common [[helminth]] (i.e., parasitic worm) infection in the United States and Western Europe.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" />  In the United States, a study by the [[Center of Disease Control]] reported an overall [[incidence rate]] of 11.4% among people of all ages.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Pinworms are particularly common in children, with [[prevalence rate]]s in this age group having been reported as high as 61% in India, 50% in England, 39% in Thailand, 37% in Sweden, and 29% in Denmark.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> [[Finger sucking]] has been shown to increase both incidence and relapse rates,<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> and [[nail biting]] has been similarly associated.<ref name="cook1994p1160"/> Because it spreads from host to host through [[contamination]], pinworms are common among people living in close contact, and tends to occur in all people within a household.<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> The prevalence of pinworms is not associated with gender,<ref name="gutierrez2000p355" /> nor with any particular [[social class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], or culture.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> Pinworms are an exception to the tenet that intestinal parasites are uncommon in affluent communities.<ref name="burkhart2005p837" /> The earliest known instance of pinworms is evidenced by pinworm eggs found in [[coprolite]], [[carbon dated]] to 7837 BC at western [[Utah]].<ref name="cook1994p1159" />
