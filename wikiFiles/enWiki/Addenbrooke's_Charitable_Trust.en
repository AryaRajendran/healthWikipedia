'''Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust''' ('''ACT''') (established 1997<ref>[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?chyno=1048868 Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) is the official independent registered charity for [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]], Cambridge, UK.

ACT's objective is to support and promote the work of Addenbrooke's for the benefit of patients and staff, by raising extra funds to enhance services, facilities and research.

Many hospitals across the UK rely on fundraising activities to supplement publicly funded services. Donations received by ACT make a real difference to patients and staff at Addenbrooke’s. Monies raised play a critical role in keeping Addenbrooke’s at the forefront of medical diagnosis, treatment and research, by enabling the purchase of sophisticated equipment not affordable through NHS budgets, funding specialist staff and providing financial support for environmental enhancements. 

Charitable donations have contributed to funds in most departments around the hospital. ACT manages the charitable funds in an effective way and aims to invest and disburse money successfully, ensuring that funds are used for the purposes for which they are raised.
