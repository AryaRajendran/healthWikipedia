=== Dream theories ===
Dr. Hobson's research specialty is quantifying mental events and correlating them with quantified brain events, with special reference to waking, sleeping and dreaming.  Following the [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]], he believes that dreams are created when random energy signals reach the brain's cortex during REM sleep.  The cortex attempts to make sense of the random inputs it is receiving, which causes dreams.<ref>{{cite web

He calls such notions "the mystique of [[fortune cookie]] dream interpretation."  For years he has proven his theories through lab testing with mice and human subjects.<ref>{{cite web
