'''Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency''' ('''α1-antitrypsin deficiency''', '''A1AD''') is a [[genetic disorder]] that causes defective production of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] (A1AT), leading to decreased A1AT activity in the [[blood]] and [[lungs]], and deposition of excessive abnormal A1AT [[protein]] in [[liver]] cells.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book | editor=Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N | title = Robbins and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease | edition=7th | pages=911–2 | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7216-0187-1}}</ref><ref name=Stoller_2005>{{cite journal | author = Stoller J, Aboussouan L | title = Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9478 | pages = 2225–36 | year = 2005| pmid = 15978931 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66781-5}}</ref> There are several forms and degrees of deficiency, principally depending on whether the sufferer has one or two copies of the affected gene because it is a codominant trait. Severe A1AT deficiency causes panacinar [[emphysema]] or [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] in adult life in many people with the condition (especially if they are exposed to cigarette smoke), as well as various liver diseases in a minority of children and adults, and occasionally more unusual problems.<ref name=Needham_2004>{{cite journal | author = Needham M, Stockley RA | title = α1-Antitrypsin deficiency • 3: Clinical manifestations and natural history | journal = Thorax | volume = 59 | issue =  5| pages = 441–5 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15115878 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2003.006510 | pmc = 1746985}}</ref> It is treated by avoidance of damaging inhalants, by [[intravenous infusion]]s of the A1AT protein, by [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of the [[liver transplant|liver]] or [[lung transplantation|lungs]], and by a variety of other measures, but it usually produces some degree of [[disability]] and reduced life expectancy.<ref name=Robbins/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[Wheeze|wheezing]], [[rhonchi]], and [[rales]]. The patient's symptoms may resemble recurrent respiratory infections or [[asthma]] that does not respond to treatment. Individuals with A1AD may develop [[emphysema]] during their thirties or forties even without a history of significant [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], though smoking greatly increases the risk for emphysema.<ref name=Robbins/> A1AD also causes impaired liver function in some patients and may lead to [[cirrhosis]] and [[liver failure]] (15%). It is a leading indication for [[liver transplantation]] in newborns.

{{see also|Alpha 1-antitrypsin}}

[[Alpha 1-antitrypsin]] (A1AT) is produced in the [[liver]], and one of its functions is to protect the lungs from [[elastase|neutrophil elastase]], an enzyme that can disrupt connective tissue.<ref name=Robbins/> Normal blood levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin are 1.5-3.5 [[gram|g]]/[[litre|l]]. In individuals with PiSS, PiMZ and PiSZ [[phenotype]]s, blood levels of A1AT are reduced to between 40 and 60% of normal levels. This is usually sufficient to protect the lungs from the effects of [[elastase]] in people who do not [[tobacco smoking|smoke]]. However, in individuals with the PiZZ phenotype, A1AT levels are less than 15% of normal, and patients are likely to develop panacinar [[emphysema]] at a young age; 50% of these patients will develop [[cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]], because the A1AT is not secreted properly and instead accumulates in the liver. A [[liver biopsy]] in such cases will reveal [[Periodic acid-Shiff|PAS]]-positive, [[diastase]]-resistant granules.

[[Cigarette]] smoke is especially harmful to individuals with A1AD.<ref name=Robbins/> In addition to increasing the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction in the [[airway]]s, [[cigarette]] smoke directly inactivates [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] essential [[methionine]] residues to [[sulfoxide]] forms, decreasing the [[enzyme]] activity by a factor of 2000.

==Genetics==
Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1 (SERPINA1) is a gene that translates the protein [[Alpha 1-antitrypsin]].  SERPINA 1 has been localized to chromosome 14q32.  Over 75 mutations of the SERPINA1 gene have been identified but clinically significant effects for Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency have only been attributed to a missense mutation in exon 5.<ref name="Genetics In Medicine Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency">{{cite journal|last=Strange|first=Charlie|coauthors=Ryan Dickson, Cindy Carter, Matthew J. Carpenter , Brian Holladay, Ryan Lundquist, and Mark L Brantly|title=Genetic Testing for Alpha 1-Antitrypsin deficiency|journal=Genetics in Medicine|year=2004|month=Jul/Aug|volume=6|issue=4|pages=204–210|doi=10.1097/01.GIM.0000132669.09819.79|url=http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v6/n4/full/gim200442a.html|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>   The single base-pair substitution produces the allele "Z" which causes alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.  The non-mutated SERPINA1 gene produces the “M” allele which produces normal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin.  Genetic diagnosis of Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is performed through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the localized mutated region of SERPINA1 and allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO probes).  A hybridized ASO probe containing the mutated sequence for the “Z” allele and an ASO probe bearing the normal DNA sequence allow direct determination of the individual's genotype, the identification of the “Z” allele in the individual and the genetic diagnosis of Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.<ref name="SERPINA1 Genetics (Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency)">{{cite web|title=Learning About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency|url=http://www.genome.gov/19518992|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

A1AT deficiency remains undiagnosed in many patients. Patients are usually labelled as having COPD without an underlying cause. It is estimated that about 1% of all COPD patients actually have A1AT deficiency. Thus, testing should be performed for all patients with COPD, asthma with irreversible air-flow obstruction, unexplained liver disease, or necrotizing panniculitis. The initial test performed is serum A1AT level. A low level of A1AT confirms the diagnosis and further assessment with A1AT protein phenotyping and A1AT genotyping should be carried out subsequently.<ref name=NEJM>{{cite journal | author = Silverman EK, Sandhaus RA | title = Alpha1-Antitrypsin Deficiency | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 360 | issue =  26| pages = 2749–2757 | year = 2009| doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp0900449| url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/26/2749 | pmid = 19553648}}</ref>

As protein electrophoresis does not completely distinguish between A1AT and other minor proteins at the alpha-1 position (agarose gel), antitrypsin can be more directly and specifically measured using a [[nephelometry|nephelometric]] or [[immunoturbidimetry|immunoturbidimetric]] method. Thus, protein electrophoresis is useful for screening and identifying individuals likely to have a deficiency. A1AT is further analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]] (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its [[isoelectric point]] or charge in a pH gradient.
Normal A1AT is termed M, as it is migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional, and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run [[proximal]] or [[distal]] to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Since the number of identified [[mutations]] has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above. As every person has two copies of the A1AT gene, a [[heterozygote]] with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although a heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band. In blood test results, the IEF results are notated as, e.g., PiMM, where Pi stands for protease inhibitor and "MM" is the banding pattern of that person.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

Other detection methods include use of [[enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays]] in vitro and radial [[immunodiffusion]].
Alpha 1-antitrypsin levels in the blood depend on the genotype. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the [[proteasome]], whereas others have a tendency to [[polymerise]], thereafter being retained in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}
* PiMM: 100% (normal)
* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiZZ: 10-15% (severe alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency)

PiZ is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[lysine]] mutation at position 342, while PiS is caused by a glutamate to valine mutation at position 264. Other rarer forms have been described; in all there are over 80 variants.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

== Treatment ==
In the United States, Canada, and several European countries, lung-affected A1AD patients may receive intravenous infusions of alpha-1 antitrypsin, derived from donated human plasma. This augmentation therapy is thought to arrest the course of the disease and halt any further damage to the lungs. Long-term studies of the effectiveness of A1AT replacement therapy are not available. It is currently recommended that patients begin augmentation therapy only after the onset of emphysema symptoms.<ref name="NEJM"/>

Augmentation therapy is not appropriate for liver-affected patients; treatment of A1AD-related liver damage focuses on alleviating the symptoms of the disease. In severe cases, [[liver transplantation]] may be necessary.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

As α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin is an [[acute phase reaction|acute phase reactant]], its [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is markedly increased during [[inflammation]] elsewhere in response to increased [[interleukin]]-1 and 6 and [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNFα]] production.

Treatments currently being studied include recombinant and inhaled forms of A1AT. Other experimental therapies are aimed at the prevention of [[polymer]] formation in the [[liver]].

== Epidemiology ==
[[File:PiZZ Europe.png|right|thumb|Distribution of PiZZ in Europe.]]
People of northern [[European ethnic groups|European]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]n ancestry are at the highest risk for A1AD. Four percent carry the PiZ [[allele]]; between 1 in 625 and 1 in 2000 are [[homozygote|homozygous]].

==History==
A1AD was discovered in 1963 by Carl-Bertil Laurell (1919–2001), at the [[University of Lund]] in [[Sweden]].<ref name=Laurell_1963>{{cite journal | author = Laurell CB, Eriksson S | title = The electrophoretic alpha 1-globulin pattern of serum in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | year = 1963 | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 132&ndash;140 | url=  | doi = 10.1080/00365516309051324}}</ref>
Laurell, along with a medical resident, Sten Eriksson, made the discovery after noting the absence of the α<sub>1</sub> band on protein [[electrophoresis]] in five of 1500 samples; three of the five patient samples were found to have developed emphysema at a young age.

The link with [[liver disease]] was made six years later, when Dr. Harvey Sharp ''et al.'' described A1AD in the context of liver disease.<ref name=Sharp_1969>{{cite journal | author = Sharp H, Bridges R, Krivit W, Freier E | title = Cirrhosis associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: a previously unrecognized inherited disorder | journal = J Lab Clin Med | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 934–9 | year = 1969 | pmid = 4182334}}</ref>
