'''Gelotology''' (from the Greek ''gelos'', meaning laughter) is the study of [[laughter]] and its effects on the body, from a [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] perspective. Its proponents often advocate induction of laughter on therapeutic grounds in [[complementary medicine]]. The field of study was pioneered by [[William F. Fry]] of [[Stanford University]].<ref name=sciam>{{cite news|last=Liebertz|first=Charmaine|title=A Healthy Laugh|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-healthy-laugh|accessdate=November 24, 2011|newspaper=Scientific American|date=September 21, 2005}}</ref> 

==History==
Gelotology was first studied by psychiatrists, although some doctors in antiquity recommended laughter as a form of medicine. It was initially deprecated by most other physicians, who doubted that laughter possessed [[analgesic]] qualities. One early study that demonstrated the effectiveness of laughter in a clinical setting showed that laughter could help patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] respond less to allergens.<ref>{{citation|last=Krois|first=John Michael|title=Embodiment in cognition and culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nfV05nU4XogC&pg=PA200|year=2007|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-5207-4|page=200}}</ref> Other studies have shown that laughter can help alleviate stress and pain, and can assist [[cardiopulmonary rehabilitation]].<ref>Jodi R.

==Types of therapy==
Several types of therapy have emerged which use laughter to help patients. 

*Humor and Laughter Therapy consist of the use of humorous materials such as books, shows, movies, or stories to encourage spontaneous discussion of the patients' own humorous experiences.  This can be provided individually or in a group setting.  The process is facilitated by a clinician.<ref>{{citation|last=Karwowski|first=Waldemar|title=International encyclopedia of ergonomics and human factors|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qFBAv_ib0VYC&pg=PA392|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-415-30430-6|page=392}}</ref> It can also be used in conversation between medical professionals and patients.<ref>{{citation|last=Rankin-Box|first=Denise F.|title=The nurse's handbook of complementary therapies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zYgvQEIwJuAC&pg=RA5-PA1974|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7020-2651-5|page=1975}}</ref>

*Laughter Meditation possesses similarities to traditional meditation.  However, it is the laughter that focuses the person to concentrate on the moment.  Through a three stage process of stretching, intentional laughing, and a period of meditative silence. It is sometimes done in group settings.<ref>{{citation|last=Mahoney|first=Michael J.|title=Constructive psychotherapy: a practical guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sTjfQwP9Md4C&pg=PA127|year=2003|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-57230-902-9|page=127}}</ref>

*[[Laughter Yoga]] is somewhat similar to traditional yoga, it is an exercise which incorporates breathing, yoga, and stretching techniques, along with laughter.  The structured format includes several laughter exercises for a period of 30 to 45 minutes facilitated by a trained individual. It can be used as supplemental or preventative therapy.<ref>{{citation|last1=Folkman|first1=Susan|last2=Nathan|first2=Peter E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Stress, Health, and Coping|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z1HG15HeqNQC&pg=PA416|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-537534-3|page=416}}</ref>
