The '''non-Hodgkin lymphomas''' (NHLs) are diverse group of [[hematological malignancy|blood cancers]] that include any kind of [[lymphoma]] except [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954456|non-Hodgkin lymphomas  }}</ref>  Types of NHL vary significantly in their severity, from indolent to very aggressive.

Lymphomas are types of [[cancer]] derived from [[lymphocyte]]s, a type of [[white blood cell]]. Lymphomas are treated by combinations of [[chemotherapy]], [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]], [[immunotherapy]], [[radiation therapy|radiation]], and [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. 

Non-Hodgkin lymphomas were classified according to the 1982 [[Working Formulation]] which recognizes 16 types.  The Working Formulation is now considered obsolete, and the classification is commonly used primarily for statistical comparisons with previous decades.  The Working Formulation has been superseded twice.

The latest lymphoma classification, the 2008 [[World Health Organization|WHO]] classification, largely abandoned the "Hodgkin" vs. "Non-Hodgkin" grouping. Instead, it lists over 80 different forms of lymphomas in four broad groups.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Steven H |editor1-last=Swerdlow |editor2-first=Elias |editor2-last=Campo |editor3-first=Nancy Lee |editor3-last=Harris |editor4-first=Elaine S. |editor4-last=Jaffe |editor5-first=Stefano A. |editor5-last=Pileri |editor6-first=Harold |editor6-last=Stein |editor7-first=Jurgan |editor7-last=Thiele |editor8-first=James W. |editor8-last=Vardiman |title=WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues |publisher=Oxford Univ Pr |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-92-832-2431-0}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>

A number of peer-reviewed health studies have shown a causal link between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and exposure to [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), a [[persistent organic pollutant]] now found throughout the natural environment.<ref name="Kramer">{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104652 |title=Current Status of the Epidemiologic Evidence Linking Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and the Role of Immune Dysregulation |year=2012 |last1=Kramer |first1=Shira |last2=Hikel |first2=Stephanie Moller |last3=Adams |first3=Kristen |last4=Hinds |first4=David |last5=Moon |first5=Katherine |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=120 |issue=8 |pages=1067–75 |pmid=22552995 |pmc=3440083}}</ref><ref name="Bertrand">{{cite journal |pmid=20087190 |year=2010 |last1=Bertrand |first1=Kimberly A. |last2=Spiegelman |first2=Donna |last3=Aster |first3=Jon C. |last4=Altshul |first4=Larisa M. |last5=Korrick |first5=Susan A. |last6=Rodig |first6=Scott J. |last7=Zhang |first7=Shumin M. |last8=Kurth |first8=Tobias |last9=Laden |first9=Francine |title=Plasma organochlorine levels and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a cohort of men |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=172–80 |doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181cb610b |pmc=2957873 |journal=Epidemiology}}</ref><ref name="Hardell">{{cite journal |pmid=19424638 |year=2009 |last1=Hardell |first1=Karin |last2=Carlberg |first2=Michael |last3=Hardell |first3=Lennart |last4=Björnfoth |first4=Helén |last5=Ericson Jogsten |first5=Ingrid Ericson |last6=Eriksson |first6=Mikael |last7=Van Bavel |first7=Bert |last8=Lindström |first8=Gunilla |title=Concentrations of organohalogen compounds and titres of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus antigens and the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1567–76 |journal=Oncology Reports |doi=10.3892/or_00000389}}</ref>

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
[[Hodgkin lymphoma]] (HL, Hodgkin disease), described by [[Thomas Hodgkin]] in 1832, was the first form of lymphoma described and defined. Other forms were later described and there was a need to classify them. Because Hodgkin lymphoma was much more radiation-sensitive than other forms, its diagnosis was important for oncologists and their patients. Thus, research originally focused on it. The first classification of Hodgkin lymphoma was proposed by [[Robert J. Luke]] in 1963. 

While consensus was rapidly reached on the classification of Hodgkin lymphoma, there remained a large group of very different diseases requiring further classification. The Rappaport classification, proposed by [[Henry Rappaport]] in 1956 and 1966, became the first widely accepted classification of lymphomas other than Hodgkin. Following its publication in 1982, the [[Working Formulation]] became the standard classification for this group of diseases. It introduced the term non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and defined three [[Grading (tumors)|grade]]s of lymphoma.

However, NHL consists of 16 different conditions that have little in common with each other. They are grouped by their aggressiveness. Less aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas are compatible with a long survival while more aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be rapidly fatal without treatment. Without further narrowing, the label is of limited usefulness for patients or doctors.

==Contributing factors==
Strongly correlated with human sewage [[sludge]] and products produced from fields utilizing sewage sludge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sewage sludge is probably a source|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/crapshoot_the_gamble_with_our_wastes/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=EPA admits non-Hodgkin lymphoma link to PCB & sludge|url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/fishshellfish/techguidance/pcb99.cfm}}</ref>

==Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and HIV==
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) included certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as AIDS-defining cancers in 1987.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3039334 |year=1987 |author1=Centers for Disease Control |title=Revision of the CDC surveillance case definition for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; AIDS Program, Center for Infectious Diseases |volume=36 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=1S–15S |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/other/mmsu3601.pdf}}</ref> Immune suppression rather than HIV itself is implicated in the pathogenesis of this malignancy, with a clear correlation between the degree of immune suppression and the risk of developing NHL.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2217/hiv.10.54 |title=HIV-related lymphoma |year=2010 |last1=Lee |first1=Belinda |last2=Bower |first2=Mark |last3=Newsom-Davis |first3=Thomas |last4=Nelson |first4=Mark |journal=HIV Therapy |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=649}}</ref> HIV-infected patients are at an increased risk for developing both Hodgkin lymphoma and NHL when compared with the general population.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198408303110904 |title=Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in 90 Homosexual Men |year=1984 |last1=Ziegler |first1=John L. |last2=Beckstead |first2=Jay A. |last3=Volberding |first3=Paul A. |last4=Abrams |first4=Donald I. |last5=Levine |first5=Alexandra M. |last6=Lukes |first6=Robert J. |last7=Gill |first7=Parkash S. |last8=Burkes |first8=Ronald L. |last9=Meyer |first9=Paul R. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=311 |issue=9 |pages=565–70 |pmid=6611504}}</ref>
Another prominent example of AIDS defining malignancy is Kaposi sarcoma, which is not a lymphoma.

==Modern usage of term==
Nevertheless, the Working Formulation and the NHL category continue to be used by many. To this day, lymphoma statistics are compiled as Hodgkin's vs non-Hodgkin lymphomas by major cancer agencies, including the [[National Cancer Institute]] in its [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results|SEER]] program, the [[Canadian Cancer Society]] and the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]].

==Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and PCBs==
A growing number of peer-reviewed, epidemiologic health studies suggest that the rising incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in recent decades may be at least partially due to incidental exposure to organochlorines such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).<ref name="Engel">{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0055 |title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma |year=2007 |last1=Engel |first1=Lawrence S. |last2=Lan |first2=Qing |last3=Rothman |first3=Nathaniel |journal=Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=373–6 |pmid=17337641}}</ref> PCBs were widely used as dielectric and coolant fluids in transformers, capacitors, and electric motors. Due to the toxicity of PCBs and their classification as [[persistent organic pollutants]], PCB production was banned by the U.S. Congress in 1977 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.<ref name="EPA2">[http://www.epa.gov/region2/pcbs/index.html "PCBs in Schools"], Region 2, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 24 August 2012.</ref><ref name="EPA3">[http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/international/agreements/ "International Agreements and Treaties on Pesticides"], Pesticides: International Activities, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 24 August 2012.</ref> Though they are no longer produced, PCBs do not readily break down once they have been released into the environment.
