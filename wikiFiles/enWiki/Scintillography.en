'''Scintillography''' is an [[Molecular imaging|imaging]] method of [[nuclear event]]s provoked by [[collision]]s or [[charged current interaction]]s among nuclear particles or [[ionizing radiation]] and [[atom]]s which result in a brief, localised pulse of [[electromagnetic radiation]], usually in the [[visible light]] range ([[Cherenkov radiation]]). This pulse ([[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]]) is usually detected and amplified by a [[photomultiplier]] or [[charged coupled device]] elements ([[scintillator]]s), and its resulting electrical waveform is processed by [[computer]]s to provide two- and three-dimensional images of a subject or [[region of interest]].

Scintillography is mainly used in [[scintillation camera]]s in [[experimental physics]]. For example, huge [[neutrino detection]] underground tanks filled with [[tetrachloroethylene]] are surrounded by arrays of photo detectors in order to capture the extremely rare event of a collision between the fluid's atoms and a [[neutrino]].

Another extensive use of scintillography is in [[medical imaging]] techniques which use [[gamma ray]] detectors called [[gamma camera]]s. Detectors coated with materials which scintillate when subjected to gamma rays are scanned with optical photon detectors and [[scintillation counter]]s. The subjects are injected with special [[radionuclide]]s which irradiate in the gamma range inside the region of interest, such as the [[heart]] or the [[brain]]. A special type of gamma camera is the [[SPECT]] (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography). Another medical scintillography technique, the [[Positron-emission tomography]] (PET), which uses the scintillations provoked by [[electron-positron annihilation]] phenomena.
