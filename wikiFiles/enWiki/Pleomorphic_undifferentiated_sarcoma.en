'''Pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma''' (abbreviated '''PUS'''), also '''undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma''' and previously '''malignant fibrous histiocytoma''' (abbreviated '''MFH'''), is a type of [[soft tissue sarcoma]].

It is considered a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] for [[sarcoma]]s that cannot be more precisely categorized.<ref name=pmid19671033>{{cite journal |author=Matushansky I, Charytonowicz E, Mills J, Siddiqi S, Hricik T, Cordon-Cardo C |title=MFH classification: differentiating undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the 21st Century |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=1135–44 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19671033 |pmc=3000413 |doi=10.1586/era.09.76 |url=}}</ref><ref name="urlNeoplasia">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/NEOHTML/NEOPL045.html |title=Neoplasia |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
PUS is regarded as the most common [[Sarcoma|soft tissue sarcoma]] of late adult life. It rarely occurs in children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alaggio R, Collini P, Randall RL, Barnette P, Million L, Coffin CM |title=Undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcomas in children: a clinicopathologic study of 10 cases and review of literature |journal=Pediatr. Dev. Pathol. |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=209–17 |year=2010 |pmid=20055602 |doi=10.2350/09-07-0673-OA.1 |url=}}</ref> It occurs more often in Caucasians than in those of African or Asian descent and is a male-predominant disease, afflicting two males for every female.

==Presentation==
PUS occurs most commonly in the extremities and [[retroperitoneum]], but has been reported in other sites. [[Metastasis]] occurs most frequently in the [[lung]]s (90%), bones (8%), and [[liver]] (1%).  

In the extremities, it presents as a painless enlarging soft tissue mass.  

==Diagnosis==
It can be detected by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), but a [[biopsy]] is required for the definitive diagnosis.  [[MRI]] findings typically show a well-circumscribed mass that is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images.  Central [[necrosis]] is often present and identifiable by imaging, especially in larger masses.

===Pathology===
Pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas are, by definition, ''[[cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]]'',  meaning (as the name implies) that they do not bear a resemblance to any normal tissue.  

The [[histomorphology]], otherwise, is characterized by high cellularity, marked [[nuclear pleomorphism]], usually accompanied by abundant mitotic activity (including [[atypical mitoses]]), and a [[spindle cell]] morphology.  [[Necrosis]] is common and characteristic of high grade lesions.  

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of surgical excision (the extent of which ranges from tumor excision to limb amputation, depending on the tumor) and in some cases radiation.  [[Chemotherapy]] remains controversial in MFH.  The usual site of metastatic disease is the lungs, and metastases should be resected if possible.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on the primary tumor grade (appearance under the microscope as judged by a [[pathologist]]), size, resectability (whether it can be completely removed surgically), and presence of metastases.  The five-year survival ranges from 35 to 60%.

==Human-human transmission==
There is a case report of human-human transmission, in a surgeon who injured his hand while working on a PUS case.<ref>{{Cite journal
