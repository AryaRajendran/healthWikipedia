In human anatomy, the '''rhomboid minor''' is a small [[skeletal muscle]] on the back that connects the [[scapula]] with the vertebrae of the [[spinal column]].

Located inferior to [[Levator scapulae muscle|levator scapulae]] and superior to [[Rhomboid major muscle|rhomboid major]], it acts together with the latter to keep the scapula pressed against the thoracic wall.
<!-- nor ref -->
It lies deep to [[Trapezius muscle|trapezius]] but superficial to the long spinal muscles.<ref name="GP">{{GPnotebook|194641998}}</ref><!-- typo in ref -->

== Origin and insertion ==
The rhomboid minor arises from the inferior border of the [[nuchal ligament]], from the [[spinous process]]es of the seventh [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] and first [[thoracic vertebrae]], and from the intervening [[supraspinous ligament]]s.
<ref name="GP" />

It is inserted into a small area of the [[Medial border of scapula|medial border]] of the scapula at the level of the [[Spine of scapula|scapular spine]].
<ref>{{MuscleLoyola|rhmn}}</ref>

== Action ==
Together with the rhomboid major, the rhomboid minor retracts the scapula when trapezius is contracted. Acting as an antagonist to the trapezius, both rhomboids elevate the medial border of the scapula medially and upward, working in tandem with the [[levator scapulae muscle]] to rotate the scapulae downward. While other shoulder muscles are active, the rhomboids stabilize the scapula.

== Innervation and blood supply ==
The nerve supply comes from the [[dorsal scapular nerve]], with most of its fibers derived from the C5 nerve root and only minor contribution from C4 or C6.
<ref name="Martin-Fish-2008">{{cite doi|10.1007/s12178-007-9000-5}}, p. 4</ref>

The rhomboid minor gets its arterial blood supply from the [[dorsal scapular artery]].

== Variation ==
It is usually separated from the rhomboid major by a slight interval, but the adjacent margins of the two muscles are occasionally united.
