'''Glutaraldehyde''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula CH<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>CHO)<sub>2</sub>. A pungent colorless oily liquid, glutaraldehyde is used to disinfect medical and dental equipment. It is also used for [[industrial water treatment]] and as a preservative.  It is mainly available as an aqueous solution, and in these solutions the aldehyde groups are hydrated.<ref name = Ullmann>{{Ullmann | author = Christian Kohlpaintner, Markus Schulte, Jürgen Falbe, Peter Lappe, Jürgen Weber | title = Aldehydes, Aliphatic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a01_321.pub2}}</ref>

==Production and structure==
Glutaraldehyde is produced industrially by the oxidation of [[cyclopentene]] and by the [[Diels-Alder reaction]] of [[acrolein]] and [[methyl vinyl ether]] followed by hydrolysis.<ref name = Ullmann/> 

Like other dialdehydes (e.g., [[glyoxal]]), it does not exist as the dialdehyde but as the hydrate.  These hydrates adopt several structures.<ref>Earl B. Whipple, Michael Ruta "Structure of Aqueous Glutaraldehyde" J. Org. Chem., 1974, vol. 39, 1666-1668. {{DOI|10.1021/jo00925a015}}</ref>

Monomeric glutaraldehyde can polymerize by [[aldol condensation]] reaction yielding alpha, beta-unsaturated poly-glutaraldehyde. This reaction usually occurs at alkaline pH values.

==Uses==

===Fixative===
A glutaraldehyde solution of 0.1% to 1.0% concentration may be used for system disinfection and as a preservative for long term storage. Glutaraldehyde is used in biological [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]] as a fixative. It kills cells quickly by crosslinking their proteins and is usually employed alone or mixed with [[formaldehyde]]<ref name=Karnovsky>Karnovsky, M.J. (1965). A formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixative of high osmolality for use in electron microscopy. Journal of Cell Biology 27: 137A–138A</ref> as the first of two [[fixation (histology)|fixative]] processes to stabilize specimens such as bacteria, plant material, and human cells. A second fixative procedure uses [[osmium tetroxide]] to crosslink and stabilize cell and [[organelle]] [[membrane lipids]]. [[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]] is usually followed by dehydration of the tissue in [[ethanol]] or [[acetone]], followed by embedding in an [[epoxy resin]] or [[acrylic resin]].

Another example of an application for treatment of proteins with glutaraldehyde is the inactivation of bacterial toxins to create [[toxoid]] vaccines, e.g., the [[pertussis]] (whooping cough) toxoid component in the Boostrix [[DPT vaccine#Tdap|Tdap]] vaccine produced by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].<ref>[http://www.gsksource.com/gskprm/en/US/adirect/gskprm?cmd=ProductDetailPage&product_id=1244167203071&featureKey=600532 Boostrix prescribing information], ©2009, GlaxoSmithKline</ref>

In a related application, glutaraldehyde is sometimes employed in the [[Leather production processes#Tanning|tanning of leather]].

===Biochemical reagent===
Glutaraldehyde is frequently used in biochemistry applications as an amine-reactive homobifunctional [[cross-link|crosslinker]].  The oligomeric state of proteins can be examined through this application. Glutaraldehyde is also used in [[SDS-PAGE]] to fix proteins and peptides prior to staining. Typically, a gel is treated with a 5% solution for approximately half an hour, after which it must be thoroughly washed to remove the yellow stain brought about by reacting with free [[tris]].

===Wart treatment===
A solution of 10% w/w glutaraldehyde is sold under the name "Diswart Solution" to remove common and plantar warts. Product claims include: "Inactivates viruses and bacteria. Dries the wart surface. Stains the area treated brown, but will not harm the surrounding skin."

===Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) Fluid===
Glutaraldehyde has been listed as a component of hydraulic fracturing "fracking" fluid.  It is included in the additive called Alpha 1427, as a biocide, according to Material Safety Data Sheets released to the Morgantown Utility Board by Northeast Natural Energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mub.org/pdfs/MIP/Fracking%20Fluid%20Info/Alpha_1427_MSDS.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mub.org/pdfs/MIP/Fracking%20Fluid%20Info/MUB_letter.pdf}}</ref>

==Safety==
As a strong disinfectant, glutaraldehyde is [[toxic]] and a strong irritant.<ref name=osh>[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/asthma.html Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) (a federal government site) > OSH Answers  > Diseases, Disorders & Injuries > Asthma] Document last updated on February 8, 2005</ref>  There is no evidence of [[carcinogenic]] activity.<ref>[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/LT_rpts/tr490.pdf Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Glutaraldehyde]</ref>
