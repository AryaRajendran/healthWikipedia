'''Fever''' (also known as '''pyrexia'''<ref name=NC08>{{cite journal |author=Axelrod YK, Diringer MN |title=Temperature management in acute neurologic disorders |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=585–603, xi |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18514828 |doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2008.02.005 |url=}}</ref>) is one of the most common [[medical signs]] and is characterized by an elevation of [[body temperature]] above the normal range of {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F|1}} due to an increase in the temperature regulatory [[Human thermoregulation#Thermoregulation in humans|set-point]].<ref name=pmid18788094 >{{cite journal |author=Karakitsos D, Karabinis A |title=Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children |journal=N.

Med. |volume=359 |issue=11 |pages=1179–80 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18788094 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc081418|url=}}</ref>  This increase in set-point triggers increased [[muscle tone]] and [[chills]].

As a person's temperature increases, there is, in general, a feeling of [[cold]] despite an increasing body temperature. Once the new temperature is reached, there is a feeling of warmth. 

A fever can be caused by many different conditions ranging from benign to potentially serious.  Some studies suggest that fever is useful as a defence mechanism as the body's immune response can be strengthened at higher temperatures, however there are arguments for and against the usefulness of fever, and the issue is controversial. With the exception of very high temperatures, treatment to reduce fever is often not necessary; however, [[antipyretic]] medications can be effective at lowering the temperature, which may improve the affected person's comfort.

Fever differs from uncontrolled [[hyperthermia]],<ref name=NC08/> in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the body's thermoregulatory set-point, due to excessive heat production and/or insufficient [[thermoregulation]].

==Definition==
{{HumanTemperature}}
A wide range for [[Normal human body temperature|normal temperatures]] has been found.<ref name=CC09>{{cite journal |author=Laupland KB |title=Fever in the critically ill medical patient |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=37 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=S273–8 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19535958 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181aa6117 |url=}}</ref>
Fever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature is caused by a raised set point and:
* Temperature in the [[anus]] (rectum/rectal) is at or over {{convert|37.5|–|38.3|C|F|1}}<ref name="NC08"/><ref name="CC09"/>
* Temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over {{convert|37.7|C|F}}<ref name=Reiew09>{{cite journal |author=Barone JE |title=Fever: Fact and fiction |journal=J Trauma |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=406–9 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19667898 |doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e3181a5f335 |url=}}</ref>
* Temperature under the arm (axillary) or in the [[ear]] (otic) is at or over {{convert|37.2|C|F}}

In healthy adult men and women, the [[Normal human body temperature|range of normal, healthy temperatures]] for oral temperature is {{convert|33.2|–|38.2|C|F|1}}, for rectal it is {{convert|34.4|–|37.8|C|F|1}}, for [[tympanic membrane]] (the ear drum) it is {{convert|35.4|–|37.8|C|F|1}}, and for axillary (the armpit) it is {{convert|35.5|–|37.0|C|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sund-Levander M, Forsberg C, Wahren LK |title=Normal oral, rectal, tympanic and axillary body temperature in adult men and women: a systematic literature review |journal=Scand J Caring Sci |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=122–8 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12000664 |doi= 10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x|url=}}</ref> Harrison's textbook of internal medicine defines a fever as a morning temperature of >37.2°C (>98.9°F) or an evening temperature of >37.7°C (>99.9°F) while the normal daily temperature variation is typically 0.5°C (0.9°F).<ref>{{cite book|first=ed. Dan L. Longo ... Eds. of previsous eds.: T.R. Harrison|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-174889-6|pages=4012|edition=18th}}</ref>

Normal body temperatures vary depending on many factors, including age, sex, time of day, ambient temperature, activity level, and more.  A raised temperature is not always a fever.  For example, the temperature of a healthy person rises when he or she exercises, but this is not considered a fever, as the set-point is normal.  On the other hand, a "normal" temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high for that person.  For example, [[medically frail]] elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a "normal" temperature of {{convert|37.3|C|F}} may represent a clinically significant fever.

===Types===
[[File:Febbre.gif|thumb|right|Performance of the various types of fever<br>
a) Fever continues<br>
b) Fever continues to abrupt onset and remission<br>
c) Fever remittent<br>
d) Intermittent fever<br>
e) Undulant fever<br>
f) Relapsing fever]]
The pattern of temperature changes may occasionally hint at the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]:

*Continuous fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than {{val|1|u=°C}} in 24 hours, ''e.g.'' [[lobar pneumonia]], [[typhoid]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[brucellosis]], or [[typhus]]. [[Typhoid fever]] may show a specific fever pattern (''Wunderlich curve'' of typhoid fever), with a slow stepwise increase and a high plateau.  (Drops due to fever-reducing drugs are excluded.)
*Intermittent fever: The temperature elevation is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal, ''e.g.'' [[malaria]], [[kala-azar]], [[pyaemia]], or [[septicemia]]. Following are its types <ref>{{cite book |last= Muhammad |first=Inayatullah  |coauthors= Shabbir Ahmad Nasir |title= Bedside Techniques: Methods of clinical examination |publisher= Saira Publishers and Salamat Iqbal Press, [[Multan]] |year= 2009 |month= May |isbn= }}

**Quotidian fever, with a periodicity of 24 hours, typical of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' or ''Plasmodium knowlesi'' [[malaria]]
**Tertian fever (48 hour periodicity), typical of ''Plasmodium vivax'' or ''Plasmodium ovale'' malaria
**Quartan fever (72 hour periodicity), typical of ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]'' malaria.
*Remittent fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than {{val|1|u=°C}} in 24 hours, ''e.g.'', [[infective endocarditis]].
*[[Pel-Ebstein fever]]: A specific kind of fever associated with [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], being high for one week and low for the next week and so on. However, there is some debate as to whether this pattern truly exists.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hilson AJ |title=Pel-Ebstein fever |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=333 |issue=1 |pages=66–7 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7777006 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199507063330118|url=}}.

A neutropenic fever, also called [[febrile neutropenia]], is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting [[neutrophil]]s, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing [[chemotherapy]] than in apparently healthy people.

''Febricula'' is an old term for a low-grade fever, especially if the cause is unknown, no other symptoms are present, and the patient recovers fully in less than a week.<ref>{{cite book

===Hyperpyrexia===
Hyperpyrexia is a fever with an extreme elevation of [[body temperature]] greater than or equal to {{convert|41.5|C|F}}.<ref name=Har08>{{cite book |author=Loscalzo, Joseph; Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, Eugene; Dennis L.

===Hyperthermia===
[[Hyperthermia]] is an example of a high temperature that is not a fever.  It occurs from a number of causes including [[heatstroke]], [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], [[malignant hyperthermia]], stimulants such as [[amphetamine]]s and [[cocaine]], [[idiosyncratic drug reaction]]s, and [[serotonin syndrome]].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[image:Michael Ancher 001.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Peter Ancher]], "The Sick Girl", 1882, [[Statens Museum for Kunst]]]]
A fever is usually accompanied by [[sickness behavior]], which consists of [[lethargy]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[sleepiness]], [[hyperalgesia]], and the inability to concentrate.<ref name="Hart">{{cite journal | last1 =Hart | author-separator =, | first1 =BL | title =Biological basis of the behavior of sick animals | journal =Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews | volume =12 | issue =2 | pages =123–37 | year =1988 | author-name-separator= |pmid=3050629 | doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(88)80004-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | last1 =Johnson  | author-separator =,  | first1 =RW  | title =The concept of sickness behavior: a brief chronological account of four key discoveries  | journal =Veterinary immunology and immunopathology  | volume =87  | issue =3–4  | pages =443–50  | year =2002 | author-name-separator=|pmid=12072271  | doi =10.1016/S0165-2427(02)00069-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Kelley | author-separator =, | first1 =KW | last2 =Bluthé | first2 =RM | last3 =Dantzer | first3 =R | last4 =Zhou | first4 =JH | last5 =Shen | first5 =WH | last6 =Johnson | first6 =RW | last7 =Broussard | first7 =SR | title =Cytokine-induced sickness behavior | journal =Brain, behavior, and immunity | volume =17 Suppl 1 | pages =S112–8 | year =2003 | author-name-separator= |pmid=12615196 | doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00077-6}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
Fever is a common [[symptom]] of many medical conditions:
* [[Infectious disease]], ''e.g.'', [[influenza]], [[HIV]], [[malaria]], [[infectious mononucleosis]], or [[gastroenteritis]]
* Various skin [[inflammation]]s, ''e.g.'', [[boils]], or [[abscess]]
* [[Immunology|Immunological]] diseases, ''e.g.'', [[lupus erythematosus]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]]s, [[Kawasaki disease]]
* Tissue destruction, which can occur in [[hemolysis]], [[surgery]], [[infarction]], [[crush syndrome]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[cerebral hemorrhage]], etc.
* Reaction to incompatible blood products
* [[Cancer]]s, most commonly [[kidney cancer]] and [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]]s
* [[Metabolic disorder]]s, ''e.g.'', [[gout]] or [[porphyria]]
* Thrombo-embolic processes, ''e.g.'', [[pulmonary embolism]] or [[deep venous thrombosis]]

Persistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called [[fever of unknown origin]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:fever-conceptual.svg|thumb|'''Hyperthermia''': Characterized on the left.

As can be seen, hyperthermia can be conceptualized as an increase above the thermoregulatory set point.<br />'''Hypothermia''': Characterized in the center: Normal body temperature is shown in green, while the hypothermic temperature is shown in blue.

It reads "New Normal" because the thermoregulatory set point has risen. This has caused what was the normal body temperature (in blue) to be considered hypothermic.]]

Temperature is ultimately regulated in the [[hypothalamus]]. A trigger of the fever, called a pyrogen, causes a release of [[prostaglandin E2]] (PGE2). PGE2 then in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which generates a systemic response back to the rest of the body, causing heat-creating effects to match a new temperature level.

In many respects, the hypothalamus works like a [[thermostat]].<ref name=Harrisons>{{cite book

}}</ref>  When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retaining heat.  [[Vasoconstriction]] both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold.  If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new setting in the hypothalamus, then [[shivering]] begins in order to use muscle movements to produce more heat.  When the fever stops, and the hypothalamic setting is set lower; the reverse of these processes (vasodilation, end of shivering and nonshivering heat production) and sweating are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.

This contrasts with [[hyperthermia]], in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat.<ref name=Harrisons />  Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment ([[heat stroke]]) or an adverse reaction to drugs.  Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to [[anti-pyretic]] medications.

===Pyrogens===
A pyrogen is a substance that induces fever. These can be either internal ([[endogenous]]) or [[external]] ([[exogenous]]) to the body. The bacterial substance [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), present in the cell wall of some bacteria, is an example of an exogenous pyrogen. Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as [[superantigens]] can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. [[Depyrogenation]] may be achieved through [[filtration]], [[distillation]], [[chromatography]], or inactivation.

====Endogenous====
In essence, all endogenous pyrogens are [[cytokines]], molecules that are a part of the [[innate immune system]].  They are produced by [[phagocytic cells]] and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus. Major endogenous pyrogens are [[interleukin 1]] (α and β),<ref name=boron-58>Chapter 58 in:  {{cite book |author=Walter F., PhD. Boron |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year=2003 |page=1300 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6). Minor endogenous pyrogens include [[interleukin-8]], [[Lymphotoxin alpha|tumor necrosis factor-β]], [[macrophage inflammatory protein]]-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-β as well as [[interferon-α]], [[IFN-β|interferon-β]], and [[Interferon-gamma|interferon-γ]].<ref name=boron-58/> [[Tumor necrosis factor-α]] also acts as a pyrogen. It is mediated by [[interleukin 1]] (IL-1) release.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stefferl|first=Andreas|coauthors=Stephen J. Hopkins, Nancy J. Rothwell & Giamal N. Luheshi|title=The role of TNF-a in fever: opposing actions of human and murine TNF-oa and interactions with IL-fl in the rat|journal=Brftish Journal of Pharmacology|date=April 25, 1996|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1909906/|accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> 

These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the [[circumventricular organ]]s of the [[Human brain|brain]] due to easier absorption caused by the [[blood–brain barrier]]'s reduced filtration action there. The cytokine factors then bind with [[endothelium|endothelial receptor]]s on vessel walls, or interact with local [[microglial cell]]s. When these cytokine factors bind, the [[arachidonic acid pathway]] is then activated.

====Exogenous====
One model for the mechanism of fever caused by exogenous pyrogens includes LPS, which is a cell wall component of [[Gram-negative|gram-negative bacteria]]. An immunological protein called [[lipopolysaccharide-binding protein]] (LBP) binds to LPS. The LBP–LPS complex then binds to the [[CD14]] receptor of a nearby [[macrophage]]. This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous [[cytokine]] factors, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In other words, exogenous factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway.

===PGE2 release===
PGE2 release comes from the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the [[enzyme]]s [[phospholipase|phospholipase A2]] (PLA2), [[cyclooxygenase|cyclooxygenase-2]] (COX-2), and [[prostaglandin E2 synthase]]. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.

PGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The set point temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the [[preoptic area]] (POA) through the [[prostaglandin E receptor 3]] (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the [[dorsomedial hypothalamus]] (DMH), the rostral [[raphe]] pallidus nucleus in the [[medulla oblongata]] (rRPa), and the [[paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) of the [[hypothalamus]] . Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving [[pituitary gland]] and various [[endocrine organs]].

===Hypothalamus===
The brain ultimately orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the [[autonomic nervous system]]. These may be:
* Increased heat production by increased [[muscle tone]], [[shivering]] and hormones like [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline)
* Prevention of heat loss, such as [[vasoconstriction]].
In infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate [[brown adipose tissue]] to produce heat (non-exercise-associated [[thermogenesis]], also known as non-shivering thermogenesis). Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased [[blood pressure]] in fever.

==Epidemiology==
About 5% of people who go to an emergency room have a fever.<ref name=EMP2012>{{cite journal|last=Nassisi|first=D|coauthors=Oishi, ML|title=Evidence-based guidelines for evaluation and antimicrobial therapy for common emergency department infections.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=2012 Jan|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1-28; quiz 28-9|pmid=22292348}}</ref>

==History==
By the time of Hippocrates several patterns of fever had been recognised: these included the  tertian (every 48 hours) and quartan (every 72 hours) fevers caused by malaria.<ref name=Sajadi2012>Sajadi MM, Bonabi R, Sajadi MR, Mackowiak PA (2012) Akhawayni and the first fever Curve. Clin Infect Dis</ref> Over the succeeding centuries a general consensus arose regarding what constitutes a fever, the distinction between fever as a symptom and fever as a disease, an elaborate classification scheme for multiple types of fever, hypotheses as to the causes of fever and various methods for diagnosing and treating fevers. In the 10th century the [[Persia]]n physician [[Akhawaynī]] created the concept of a fever curve - fever against time as a diagnostic aid.

==Society and culture==

===Fever phobia===
Fever phobia is the name given by medical experts to parents' misconceptions about fever in their children.  Among them, many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a [[disease]] rather than a [[medical sign]], that even low fevers are harmful, and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified "normal" number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever.<ref name=pubmed11389237 />  They are also afraid of harmless side effects like [[febrile seizure]]s and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers.<ref name=pubmed11389237 />  The underlying problem, according to professor of pediatrics Barton D. Schmitt, is "as parents we tend to suspect that our children’s brains may melt."<ref>{{cite news |title=Lifting a Veil of Fear to See a Few Benefits of Fever |author=Klass, Perri |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 January 2011 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/health/11klass.html }}</ref>

As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child's sleep to give the child more medicine.<ref name=pubmed11389237>{{cite journal |author=Crocetti M, Moghbeli N, Serwint J |title=Fever phobia revisited: have parental misconceptions about fever changed in 20 years? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=6 |pages=1241–6 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11389237 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.6.1241 }}</ref>

===Etymology===
Pyrexia is from the Greek ''pyr'' meaning ''fire''. Febrile is from the [[Latin]] word ''[[febris]]'', meaning ''fever'', and archaically known as ''ague''.

== Other animals ==
Fever is an important feature for the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[veterinary medicine|disease in domestic animals]]. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a [[horse]] is said to have a fever above {{val|101|u=°F}} ({{val|38|u=°C}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equusite.com/articles/health/healthVitalSigns.shtml|title=Equusite Vital Signs|publisher=www.equusite.com | accessdate = 2010-03-22}}</ref> In species that allow the body to have a wide range of "normal" temperatures, such as [[camel]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/188/1/103|title=Body Temperature of the Camel and Its Relation to Water Economy |publisher=ajplegacy.physiology.org | accessdate = 2010-03-22}}</ref> it is sometimes difficult to determine a febrile stage.
