The '''Dioxin Reassessment Report''' refers to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s scientific reassessment of the health effects of exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]]. It began in April 1991, and in 1994 was published for public review. In 1995 the Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed it, concluding that three chapters (eight, nine and a new chapter) be subject to independent peer review. This involved a 2003 review of the reassessment by the Interagency Working Group on Dioxin (Dioxin IWG), who recommended a further review by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS). This review by the NAS began in November 2004, and was expected to end by June 2006. As of 2012, the review is ongoing.<ref>[http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/CFM/nceaQFind.cfm?keyword=Dioxin EPA Environmental Assessment: Dioxin] Retrieved 2012-02-06.</ref>
