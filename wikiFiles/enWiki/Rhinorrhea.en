'''Rhinorrhea''' or '''rhinorrhoea''' is a condition where the [[nasal cavity]] is filled with a significant amount of mucous fluid. The condition, commonly known as "runny [[Human nose|nose]]", occurs relatively frequently. Rhinorrhea is a common [[symptom]] of [[allergies]] or certain diseases, such as the [[common cold]] or [[hay fever]]. It can be a side effect of [[crying]], exposure to cold temperatures, [[cocaine]] abuse <ref>{{cite web| publisher=US National Library of Medicine| title=Palatal necrosis due to cocaine abuse| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20060991| accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> or [[withdrawal]], such as from [[opioid]]s like [[methadone]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Eileen Trigoboff; Kneisl, Carol Ren; Wilson, Holly Skodol |title=Contemporary psychiatric-mental health nursing |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2004 |isbn=0-13-041582-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=274}}</ref> Treatment for rhinorrhea is not usually necessary, but there are a number of medical treatments and preventative techniques available.

The term was coined in 1866 and is a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms "rhin-" meaning "of the nose" and "-rhoia" meaning "discharge or flow".<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary| title=Rhinorrhea| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=rhinorrhea&searchmode=none| accessdate=2011-09-21}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Rhinorrhea is characterized by an excess amount of mucus produced by the [[mucous membranes]] that line the nasal cavities. The membranes create mucus faster than it can be processed, causing a backup of mucus in the nasal cavities. As the cavity fills up, it blocks off the air passageway, causing difficulty breathing through the nose. Air caught in nasal cavities, namely the [[paranasal sinuses|sinus cavities]], cannot be released and the resulting pressure may cause a headache or facial pain. If the sinus passage remains blocked, there is a chance that [[sinusitis]] may result.<ref name=NLM>{{cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003051.htm | accessdate=2007-11-01 | publisher=US NLM/NIH | work=Medline Plus | title=Nasal discharge }}</ref> If the mucus backs up through the [[Eustachian tube]], it may result in ear pain or an [[otitis|ear infection]]. Excess mucus accumulating in the throat or back of the nose may cause a [[post-nasal drip]], resulting in a sore throat or coughing.<ref name=NLM/> Additional symptoms include [[sneeze|sneezing]], [[epistaxis|nosebleeds]], and nasal discharge.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=FreeMd| url=http://www.freemd.com/rhinorrhea/overview.htm| title=Rhinorrhea Overview| accessdate=2011-09-21}}</ref>

==Causes==

===Cold temperature===
Rhinorrhea is especially common during winter months. Cold-induced rhinorrhea occurs due to a combination of thermodynamics and the body's natural reactions to cold weather stimuli. One of the purposes of nasal mucus is to warm inhaled air to body temperature as it enters the body. In order for this to happen, the nasal cavities must be constantly coated with liquid mucus. During cold, dry seasons, the mucus lining nasal passages tends to dry out, meaning that mucous membranes must work harder, producing more mucus to keep the cavity lined. As a result, the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus. At the same time, when air is exhaled, water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the colder outside temperature near the nostrils. This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities. In these cases, the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=NPR| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99844567| title=Why Does Cold Weather Cause Runny Noses?| accessdate=2011-09-22}}</ref>

===Infection===
Rhinorrhea can be a symptom of other diseases, such as the [[common cold]] or [[influenza]]. During these infections, the nasal mucous membranes produce excess mucus, filling the nasal cavities. This is to prevent infection from spreading to the lungs and respiratory tract, where it could cause far worse damage.<ref name="kids">{{cite web| title=Why Does My Nose Run?| publisher=Kids Health| accessdate=2011-09-22| url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/nose_run.html}}</ref> Rhinorrhea caused by these infections usually occur on [[circadian rhythm]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smolensky MH, Reinberg A, Labrecque G |title=Twenty-four hour pattern in symptom intensity of viral and allergic rhinitis: treatment implications |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=95 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=1084–96 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7751526 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Over the course of a viral infection, [[sinusitis]] (the inflammation of the nasal tissue) may occur, causing the mucous membranes to release more mucus. Acute sinusitis consists of the nasal passages swelling during a viral infection. Chronic sinusitis occurs when one or more [[nasal polyp]]s appear. This can be caused by a [[Nasal septum deviation|deviated septum]] as well as a viral infection.<ref name="prime">{{cite web| publisher=Prime Health Channel| title=Rhinorrhea – Definition, Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment| accessdate=2011-09-24| date=2011-08-30| url=http://www.primehealthchannel.com/rhinorrhea-definition-symptoms-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment.html}}</ref>

===Allergies===
[[File:Misc pollen.jpg|thumb|right|Pollen grains from a variety of common plants can cause an allergic reaction.]]
Rhinorrhea can also occur when individuals with allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, dust, latex, soy, shellfish, or animal dander, are exposed to these allergens. In people with sensitized immune systems, the inhalation of one of these substances triggers the production of the [[antibody]] [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE), which binds to [[mast cell]]s and [[basophil]]s. IgE bound to mast cells are stimulated by pollen and dust, causing the release of inflammatory mediators such as [[histamine]].<ref>{{cite book| last1=Dipiro| first=J.T.| last2=Talbert| first2=R.L.| last3=Yee| first3=G.C.| title=Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach| edition=7th| location=New York, NY| publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc| year=2008| pages=1565–1575| isbn=978-0-07-147899-1}}</ref> In turn, this causes, among other things, inflammation and swelling of the tissue of the nasal cavities as well as increased mucus production. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can make the condition considerably worse.

===Lacrimation===
Rhinorrhea is also associated with shedding tears, whether from emotional events or from eye irritation. When an excess amount of [[tears]] are produced, the liquid drains through the [[lacrimal canaliculi|inner corner of the eyelids]], through the [[nasolacrimal duct]], and into the nasal cavities. As more tears are shed, more liquid flows into the nasal cavities. The buildup of fluid is usually resolved via mucus expulsion through the nostrils.<ref name="kids"/>

===Head trauma===
{{Main|Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea}}
If caused by a head injury, rhinorrhea can be a much more serious condition. A [[basilar skull fracture]] can result in a rupture of the barrier between the sinonasal cavity and the [[anterior cranial fossa]]e or the [[middle cranial fossa]]e. This rupture can cause the nasal cavity to fill with cerebrospinal fluid. This condition, known as [[cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea]] or CSF rhinorrhea, can lead to a number of serious complications and possibly death if not addressed properly.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Medscape| author=Welch et al.| title=CSF Rhinorrhea| accessdate=2011-09-22| date=2011-07-22| url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/861126-overview}}</ref>

===Other causes===
Rhinorrhea can occur as a symptom of opioid withdrawal accompanied by lachrymation.<ref>{{cite web| title=Opioid Withdrawal Protocol| publisher=Mental Health and Addiction Services| accessdate=2011-09-24| url=http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/pdf/Opioid_Withdrawal_Protocol.pdf}}</ref> Other causes include [[cystic fibrosis]], [[whooping cough]], nasal tumors, hormonal changes, and [[cluster headaches]]. Rhinorrhea can also be the side effect of several genetic disorders, such as [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]].<ref name="prime"/>

==Treatment==
In most cases treatment for rhinorrhea is not necessary and will clear up on its own - especially if it is the symptom of an infection. For general cases, blowing your nose can get rid of the mucus buildup. Alternatively, [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] nasal sprays and [[Vasoconstrictor]] nasal sprays may also be used, but may become counterproductive after several days of use, causing [[Rhinitis medicamentosa]]. 

In recurring cases, such as those due to allergies, there are medicinal treatments available. For cases caused by histamine buildup, several types of [[antihistamine]]s can be obtained relatively cheaply from drugstores.

People who prefer to keep clear nasal passages, such as singers, who need a clear nasal passage to perform, may use a technique called "[[nasal irrigation]]" to prevent rhinorrhea. Nasal irrigation involves rinsing the nasal cavity regularly with salty water or store bought [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] solutions.<ref>{{cite web| title=Got a Runny Nose?
