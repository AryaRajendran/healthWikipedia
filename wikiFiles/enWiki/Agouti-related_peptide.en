'''Agouti-related protein''' also called '''Agouti-related peptide''' ('''AgRP''') is a [[neuropeptide]] produced in the [[brain]] by the AgRP/NPY neuron. It is only synthesised in NPY containing cell bodies located in the ventromedial part of the [[arcuate nucleus]] in the hypothalamus.<ref name="pmid15193430">{{cite journal | author = Bäckberg M, Madjid N, Ogren SO, Meister B | title = Down-regulated expression of agouti-related protein (AGRP) mRNA in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of hyperphagic and obese tub/tub mice | journal = Brain Res.

==Structure==
AgRP is a paracrine signalling molecule made up of 132 amino acids.  It was independently identified by two teams in 1997 based on its sequence similarity with [[Agouti signalling peptide]] (ASIP), a protein synthesised in the skin that controls coat colour.<ref name="pmid9119224">{{cite journal | author = Shutter JR, Graham M, Kinsey AC, Scully S, Lüthy R, Stark KL | title = Hypothalamic expression of ART, a novel gene related to agouti, is up-regulated in obese and diabetic mutant mice | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 593–602 | year = 1997 | month = March | pmid = 9119224 | doi = 10.1101/gad.11.5.593 | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid9311920">{{cite journal | author = Ollmann MM, Wilson BD, Yang YK, Kerns JA, Chen Y, Gantz I, Barsh GS | title = Antagonism of central melanocortin receptors in vitro and in vivo by agouti-related protein | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5335 | pages = 135–8 | year = 1997 | month = October | pmid = 9311920 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5335.135 | url = | issn = }}</ref> AgRP is approximately 25% identical to ASIP. The [[murine]] homologue of AgRP is made up of 131 amino acids and shares 81% amino acid identity with the human protein.

Its secondary structure consists mainly of random coils and β-sheets.<ref name="pmid9819197">{{cite journal | author = Rosenfeld RD, Zeni L, Welcher AA, Narhi LO, Hale C, Marasco J, Delaney J, Gleason T, Philo JS, Katta V, Hui J, Baumgartner J, Graham M, Stark KL, Karbon W | title = Biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological characterization of bacterially expressed human agouti-related protein | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 46 | pages = 16041–52 | year = 1998 | month = November | pmid = 9819197 | doi = 10.1021/bi981027m | url = | issn = }}</ref> AgRP is mapped to human chromosome 16q22 and mouse chromosome 8D1-D2.

==Function==
Agouti-related protein is primarily expressed in the adrenal gland, subthalamic nucleus and hypothalamus; with lower levels of expression in the testis, kidneys and lungs. The appetite stimulating effects of AgRP are inhibited by the hormone [[leptin]] and activated by the hormone [[ghrelin]]. [[Adipocytes]] secrete leptin in response to food intake. This hormone acts in the arcuate nucleus and inhibits the AgRP/NPY neuron from releasing [[orexigenic]] peptides.<ref name="pmid17339026">{{cite journal | author = Enriori PJ, Evans AE, Sinnayah P, Jobst EE, Tonelli-Lemos L, Billes SK, Glavas MM, Grayson BE, Perello M, Nillni EA, Grove KL, Cowley MA | title = Diet-induced obesity causes severe but reversible leptin resistance in arcuate melanocortin neurons | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–94 | year = 2007 | month = March | pmid = 17339026 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2007.02.004 | url = | issn = }}</ref> Ghrelin has receptors on NPY/AgRP neurons that stimulate the secretion of NPY and AgRP to increase appetite.

It has been found that AgRP stimulates the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]] to release [[ACTH]], [[cortisol]] and [[prolactin]].

==Mechanism==

AGRP has been demonstrated to be an inverse agonist of [[melanocortin receptor]]s, specifically, [[Melanocortin 3 receptor|MC3-R]] and [[Melanocortin 4 receptor|MC4-R]]. The melanocortin receptors, MC3-R and MC4-R, are directly linked to [[metabolism]] and body weight control. These receptors are activated by the peptide hormone [[Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone|α-MSH]] (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) and antagonized by the agouti-related protein.<ref name="pmid17185225">{{cite journal | author = Jackson PJ, Douglas NR, Chai B, Binkley J, Sidow A, Barsh GS, Millhauser GL | title = Structural and molecular evolutionary analysis of Agouti and Agouti-related proteins | journal = Chem.

This inverse agonism not only [[Receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] the action of melanocortin agonists, such as α-MSH but also further decreases the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] produced by the affected [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. The exact mechanism by which AgRP inhibits melanocortin-receptor signalling is not completely clear. It has been suggested that Agouti-related protein binds MSH receptors and acts as a competitive antagonist of [[ligand binding]].<ref name="pmid9450927">{{cite journal | author = Ollmann MM, Lamoreux ML, Wilson BD, Barsh GS | title = Interaction of Agouti protein with the melanocortin 1 receptor in vitro and in vivo | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–30 | year = 1998 | month = February | pmid = 9450927 | pmc = 316484 | doi = 10.1101/gad.12.3.316| url = | issn = }}</ref> Studies of Agouti protein in B16 melanoma cells supported this logic. The expression of AgRP in the adrenal gland is regulated by [[glucocorticoid]]s.  The protein blocks α-MSH induced secretion of [[corticosterone]].<ref name="pmid12535647">{{cite journal | author = Dhillo WS, Small CJ, Gardiner JV, Bewick GA, Whitworth EJ, Jethwa PH, Seal LJ, Ghatei MA, Hinson JP, Bloom SR | title = Agouti-related protein has an inhibitory paracrine role in the rat adrenal gland | journal = Biochem.

==History==

[[Ortholog]]s of AgRP, ASIP, MCIR and MC4R have been found in mammalian, teleost fish and avian genomes.  This suggests that the agouti-melanocortin system evolved by [[gene duplication]] from individual ligand and receptor genes in the last 500 million years.<ref name="pmid17185225"/>

AgRP mRNA levels have been found to be down regulated following an acute stressful event. Studies suggest that systems involved in the regulation of stress response and of energy balance are highly integrated. Loss or gain of AgRP function may result in inadequate adaptive behavioural responses to environmental events, such as stress, and may potentially contribute to the development of [[eating disorder]]s. It has been shown that polymorphisms in the AgRP gene have been linked with [[anorexia nervosa]]<ref name="pmid11326303">{{cite journal | author = Vink T, Hinney A, van Elburg AA, van Goozen SH, Sandkuijl LA, Sinke RJ, Herpertz-Dahlmann BM, Hebebrand J, Remschmidt H, van Engeland H, Adan RA | title = Association between an agouti-related protein gene polymorphism and anorexia nervosa | journal = Mol.

Some studies suggest that inadequate signalling of AgRP during stress may result in [[binge eating]].
Recent studies have shown that [[autophagy]] plays a key role in regulation of food intake and energy balance in maintaning neuronal AgRP levels.<ref>Kaushik S, Rodriguez-Navarro JA, Arias E, Kiffin R, Sahu S, Schwartz GJ, Cuervo AM, Singh R.
