'''Cancer''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-cancer.ogg|ˈ|k|æ|n|s|ər}}, known medically as a [[malignancy|malignant]] [[neoplasm]], is a broad group of various [[disease]]s, all involving unregulated cell growth. In cancer, [[cell (biology)|cells]] divide and grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors, and invade nearby parts of the body. The cancer may also [[metastasis|spread]] to more distant parts of the body through the [[lymph|lymphatic system]] or [[blood]]stream. Not all tumors are cancerous. [[Benign tumor]]s do not grow uncontrollably, do not invade neighboring tissues, and do not spread throughout the body. There are over 200 different known cancers that afflict humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/how-many-different-types-of-cancer-are-there |title=How many different types of cancer are there? : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK |format= |work= |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref>

<!--Cause -->
Determining what causes cancer is complex. Many things are known to increase the risk of cancer, including [[tobacco]] use, certain [[infection]]s, [[radiation]], [[lack of physical activity]], [[obesity]], and environmental pollutants.<ref name=Enviro2008>{{cite journal | author = Anand P, Kunnumakkara AB, Kunnumakara AB, Sundaram C, Harikumar KB, Tharakan ST, Lai OS, Sung B, Aggarwal BB | title = Cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes | journal = Pharm.

<!--Diagnosis, Treatment, Epidemiology -->
Cancer can be detected in a number of ways, including the presence of certain [[Cancer signs and symptoms|signs and symptoms]], [[cancer screening|screening tests]], or [[medical imaging]]. Once a possible cancer is detected it is diagnosed by [[histology|microscopic examination]] of a [[biopsy|tissue sample]]. Cancer is usually treated with [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]] and [[surgery]]. The chances of surviving the disease vary greatly by the type and location of the cancer and the extent of disease at the start of treatment. While cancer can affect people of all ages, and a few types of cancer are more common in children, the risk of developing cancer generally increases with age. In 2007, cancer caused about 13% of [[causes of death|all human deaths]] worldwide (7.9&nbsp;million). Rates are rising as more people live to an old age and as mass lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.<ref name=Epi11/>

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Cancer signs and symptoms}}
[[Image:Symptoms of cancer metastasis.svg|thumb|Symptoms of cancer [[metastasis]] depend on the location of the tumor.]]
When cancer begins it invariably produces no symptoms with signs and symptoms only appearing as the mass continues to grow or [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerates]].<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> The findings that result depends on the type and location of the cancer.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> Few symptoms are [[non-specific symptom|specific]], with many of them also frequently occurring in individuals who have other conditions.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> Cancer is the new "[[the great imitator|great imitator]]".<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> Thus it is not uncommon for people diagnosed with cancer to have been treated for other diseases to which it was assumed their symptoms were due.<ref name=Card10>Holland Chp. 1</ref>

===Local effects===
Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> For example, mass effects from [[lung cancer]] can cause blockage of the [[bronchus]] resulting in [[cough]] or [[pneumonia]]; [[esophageal cancer]] can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and [[colorectal cancer]] may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, resulting in changes in bowel habits.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> Masses of breast or testicles may be easily felt.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> [[ulcer (dermatology)|Ulceration]] can cause bleeding which, if it occurs in the lung, will lead to [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], in the bowels to [[anemia]] or [[Lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]], in the bladder to blood in the urine, and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial swelling is usually painless.<!--<ref name=Card10/> --> Some cancers can cause build up of fluid within the chest or abdomen.<ref name=Card10/>

===Systemic symptoms===
General symptoms occur due to distant effects of the cancer that are not related to direct or metastatic spread. These may include: unintentional weight loss, [[fever]], being excessively tired, and changes to the skin.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Dell|first=edited by Michael D. Stubblefield, Michael W.|title=Cancer rehabilitation principles and practice|year=2009|publisher=Demos Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-1-933864-33-4|page=983|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=_JaPlNYgXkEC&pg=PT983}}</ref> [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin disease]], [[leukemia]]s, and cancers of the liver or kidney can cause a persistent [[fever of unknown origin]].<ref name=Card10/>

Specific constellations of systemic symptoms, termed [[paraneoplastic phenomenon|paraneoplastic phenomena]], may occur with some cancers. Examples include the appearance of [[myasthenia gravis]] in [[thymoma]] and [[nail clubbing|clubbing]] in [[lung cancer]].<ref name=Card10/>

===Metastasis===
{{main|Metastasis}}
[[Symptoms of metastasis]] are due to the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. They can include enlarged [[lymph node]]s (which can be felt or sometimes seen under the skin and are typically hard), [[hepatomegaly]] (enlarged liver) or [[splenomegaly]] (enlarged spleen) which can be felt in the [[abdomen]], pain or [[fracture]] of affected bones, and [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms.<ref name=Card10/>

==Causes==
Cancers are primarily an environmental disease with 90–95% of cases attributed to environmental factors and 5–10% due to genetics.<ref name=Enviro2008/> ''[[Environment (biophysical)|Environmental]]'', as used by cancer researchers, means any cause that is not [[Heredity|inherited genetically]], not merely pollution.<ref name="isbn0-387-78192-7">{{cite book | author = Kravchenko J, Akushevich I, Manton, KG | title = Cancer mortality and morbidity patterns in the U. S. population: an interdisciplinary approach | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 0-387-78192-7 | quote = The term ''environment'' refers not only to air, water, and soil but also to substances and conditions at home and at the workplace, including diet, smoking, alcohol, drugs, exposure to chemicals, sunlight, ionizing radiation, electromagnetic fields, infectious agents, etc. Lifestyle, economic and behavioral factors are all aspects of our environment. }}</ref> Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include [[tobacco]] (25–30%), diet and [[obesity]] (30–35%), [[infection]]s (15–20%), [[radiation]] (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), stress, lack of [[physical exercise|physical activity]], and [[environmental pollutants]].<ref name=Enviro2008/>

It is nearly impossible to prove what caused a cancer in any individual, because most cancers have multiple possible causes. For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, then there is a small chance that the cancer developed because of air pollution or radiation.

===Chemicals===
{{Further|Alcohol and cancer|Smoking and cancer}}
[[Image:Cancer smoking lung cancer correlation from NIH.svg|thumb|right|The incidence of [[lung cancer]] is highly correlated with [[smoking]].]]
Cancer pathogenesis is traceable back to [[DNA mutations]] that impact cell growth and metastasis. Substances that cause DNA mutations are known as mutagens, and mutagens that cause cancers are known as carcinogens. Particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer. [[Tobacco smoking]] is associated with many forms of cancer,<ref name=Sasco>{{cite journal | author = Sasco AJ, Secretan MB, Straif K | title = Tobacco smoking and cancer: a brief review of recent epidemiological evidence | journal = Lung Cancer | volume = 45 Suppl 2 | issue = | pages = S3–9 | year = 2004 | month = August | pmid = 15552776 | doi = 10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.07.998 }}</ref> and causes 90% of [[lung cancer]].<ref name="pmid9594919">{{cite journal | author = Biesalski HK, Bueno de Mesquita B, Chesson A, Chytil F, Grimble R, Hermus RJ, Köhrle J, Lotan R, Norpoth K, Pastorino U, Thurnham D | title = European Consensus Statement on Lung Cancer: risk factors and prevention.

===Diet and exercise===
{{anchor|Diet}}
Diet, [[Physical activity|physical inactivity]], and [[obesity]] are related to approximately 30–35% of cancer deaths.<ref name=Enviro2008/><ref name=Nutri06/> In the United States excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.<ref name=Nutri06/> Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on [[immune system]] and [[endocrine system]].<ref name=Nutri06/>  More than half of the effect from diet is due to [[overnutrition]] rather than from eating too few healthful foods.

Diets that are very low in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, and high in [[processed meat|processed]] or red meats are linked with a number of cancers.<ref name=Nutri06>{{cite journal | author = Kushi LH, Byers T, Doyle C, Bandera EV, McCullough M, McTiernan A, Gansler T, Andrews KS, Thun MJ | title = American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for cancer prevention: reducing the risk of cancer with healthy food choices and physical activity | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 254–81; quiz 313–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17005596 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.56.5.254 }}</ref> A high-[[salt]] diet is linked to [[gastric cancer]], [[aflatoxin B1]], a frequent food contaminate, with liver cancer, and [[Betel nut]] chewing with oral cancer.<ref name="pmid18990005">{{cite journal | author = Park S, Bae J, Nam BH, Yoo KY | title = Aetiology of cancer in Asia | journal = Asian Pac.

===Infection===
{{Main|Infectious causes of cancer}}
Worldwide approximately 18% of cancer deaths are related to [[infectious disease]]s.<ref name=Enviro2008/> This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.<ref name=Enviro2008/> [[Virus]]es are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but [[bacteria]] and [[parasites]] may also have an effect.

A virus that can cause cancer is called an ''[[oncovirus]]''. These include [[human papillomavirus]] ([[cervical carcinoma]]), [[Epstein–Barr virus]] ([[B-cell lymphoproliferative disease]] and [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]]), [[Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus]] ([[Kaposi's sarcoma]] and primary effusion lymphomas), [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]] viruses ([[hepatocellular carcinoma]]), and [[Human T-cell leukemia virus-1]] (T-cell leukemias). Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in [[Helicobacter pylori]]-induced [[gastric carcinoma]].<ref name=Viral04>{{cite journal | author = Pagano JS, Blaser M, Buendia MA, Damania B, Khalili K, Raab-Traub N, Roizman B | title = Infectious agents and cancer: criteria for a causal relation | journal = Semin.

===Radiation===
{{main|radiation-induced cancer}}
Up to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both [[ionizing radiation]] and [[non-ionizing radiation|non-ionizing]] [[ultraviolet radiation]] .<ref name=Enviro2008/> Additionally, the vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing [[ultraviolet radiation]].

Sources of ionizing radiation include [[medical imaging]], and [[radon]] gas. Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced [[leukemia]]s typically require 2–10 years to appear.<ref name=Little /> Some people, such as those with [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] or [[retinoblastoma]], are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.<ref name=Little /> Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.<ref name=Little /> Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.<ref name=Little /> Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as [[passive smoking]].<ref name=Little /> Low-dose exposures, such as living near a [[nuclear power plant]], are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.<ref name=Little /> Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.<ref name=Little />

Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a [[chromosome]], it can break the chromosome, result in an [[aneuploidy|abnormal number of chromosomes]], inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause [[chromosome translocation]]s, or cause other types of [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome abnormalities]].<ref name=Little /> Major damage normally results in the cell dying, but smaller damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer, especially if [[tumor suppressor gene]]s were damaged by the radiation.<ref name=Little>{{cite book | editor = Kufe DW, Pollock RE, Weichselbaum RR, Bast RC Jr, Gansler TS, Holland JF, Frei E III | title = Cancer medicine | author = Little JB | chapter = Chapter 14: Ionizing Radiation | edition = 6th | publisher = B.C.

Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.<ref name=Little /> It is also used in some kinds of [[medical imaging]].

===Heredity===
{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary ("sporadic cancers"). [[Hereditary cancer]]s are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect.

Some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.<ref name=Maltoni>{{cite book | author = Maltoni CFM, Holland JF | editor = Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE, ''et al.'' | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition = 5th | publisher = B.C. Decker | location = Hamilton, Ontario | year = 2000 | chapter = Chapter 16: Physical Carcinogens | isbn = 1-55009-113-1 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20770/ | accessdate = 31 January 2011}}</ref>

A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to [[asbestos]], naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of [[mesothelioma]], which is a cancer of the [[serous membrane]], usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.<ref name=Maltoni /> Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as [[wollastonite]], [[attapulgite]], [[glass wool]], and [[rock wool]], are believed to have similar effects.<ref name=Maltoni />

Nonfibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]], and [[crystalline silica]] ([[quartz]], [[cristobalite]], and [[tridymite]]).<ref name=Maltoni />

Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.<ref name=Maltoni />

Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.<ref name=Gaeta>{{cite book|author=Gaeta, John F|editor=Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE, ''et al.''|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|edition=5th|publisher=B.C. Decker|location=Hamilton, Ontario|year=2000|chapter=Chapter 17: Trauma and Inflammation|isbn=1-55009-113-1|oclc=|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20784/|accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref> Claims that breaking bone resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.<ref name=Gaeta /> Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.<ref name=Gaeta />

One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by [[kanger]] and kairo heaters (charcoal [[hand warmer]]s), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.<ref name=Gaeta /> Frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.<ref name=Gaeta />

Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.<ref name=Gaeta /> However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation. There is no evidence that [[inflammation]] itself causes cancer.<ref name=Gaeta />

===Hormones===
Some [[hormone]]s play a role in the development of cancer by promoting [[cell growth|cell proliferation]].<ref name=Henderson>{{cite book | author = Henderson BE, Bernstein L, Ross

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, [[endometrium]], prostate, ovary, and [[testicle|testis]], and also of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[bone cancer]].<ref name=Henderson />  For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.<ref name=Henderson /> Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.<ref name=Henderson /> Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating [[androstanediol glucuronide]], have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.<ref name=Henderson />

Other factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.<ref name=Henderson /> Women who take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.<ref name=Henderson /> On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.<ref name=Henderson /> [[Osteosarcoma]] may be promoted by [[growth hormone]]s.<ref name=Henderson /> Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers.<ref name=Henderson />

===Other===
Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]].

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Carcinogenesis}}
[[File:Cancer requires multiple mutations from NIHen.png|thumb|right|Cancers are caused by a series of mutations. Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell somewhat.]]

Cancer is fundamentally a disease of failure of regulation of tissue growth. In order for a normal cell to [[malignant transformation|transform]] into a cancer cell, the [[gene]]s which regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered.<ref name="pmid18234754">{{cite journal | author = Croce CM | title = Oncogenes and cancer | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 358 | issue = 5 | pages = 502–11 | year = 2008 | month = January | pmid = 18234754 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072367 }}</ref>

The affected genes are divided into two broad categories. [[Oncogene]]s are genes which promote cell growth and reproduction. [[Tumor suppressor gene]]s are genes which inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in ''many'' genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.<ref name="pmid11905807">{{cite journal | author = Knudson AG | title = Two genetic hits (more or less) to cancer | journal = Nat. Rev. Cancer | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–62 | year = 2001 | month = November | pmid = 11905807 | doi = 10.1038/35101031 }}</ref>

Genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms. The gain or loss of an entire [[chromosome]] can occur through errors in [[mitosis]]. More common are [[mutation]]s, which are changes in the [[nucleotide]] sequence of genomic DNA.

Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. [[Gene duplication|Genomic amplification]] occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. [[Chromosomal translocation|Translocation]] occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], and results in production of the [[BCR (gene)|BCR]]-[[aBL (gene)|abl]] [[fusion protein]], an oncogenic [[tyrosine kinase]].

Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of a gene and affect its [[gene expression|expression]], or may occur in the gene's [[coding sequence]] and alter the function or stability of its [[protein]] product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from [[provirus|integration of genomic material]] from a [[DNA virus]] or [[retrovirus]], and resulting in the expression of ''viral'' oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.

Replication of the enormous amount of data contained within the DNA of living cells will [[probability|probabilistically]] result in some errors (mutations). Complex error correction and prevention is built into the process, and safeguards the cell against cancer. If significant error occurs, the damaged cell can "self-destruct" through programmed cell death, termed [[apoptosis]]. If the error control processes fail, then the mutations will survive and be passed along to [[cell division|daughter cells]].

Some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate. Such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called [[carcinogen]]s, repeated physical injury, heat, ionising radiation, or [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nelson DA, Tan TT, Rabson AB, Anderson D, Degenhardt K, White E | title = Hypoxia and defective apoptosis drive genomic instability and tumorigenesis | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 18 | issue = 17 | pages = 2095–107 | year = 2004 | month = September | pmid = 15314031 | pmc = 515288 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1204904 }}</ref>

The errors which cause cancer are ''self-amplifying'' and ''compounding'', for example:
* A mutation in the error-correcting machinery of a cell might cause that cell and its children to accumulate errors more rapidly.
* A further mutation in an oncogene might cause the cell to reproduce more rapidly and more frequently than its normal counterparts.
* A further mutation may cause loss of a tumour suppressor gene, disrupting the apoptosis signalling pathway and resulting in the cell becoming immortal.
* A further mutation in signaling machinery of the cell might send error-causing signals to nearby cells.

The transformation of normal cell into cancer is akin to a [[chain reaction]] caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape the controls that limit normal tissue growth. This rebellion-like scenario becomes an undesirable [[survival of the fittest]], where the driving forces of [[evolution]] work against the body's design and enforcement of order. Once cancer has begun to develop, this ongoing process, termed ''clonal evolution'' drives progression towards more invasive [[cancer staging|stages]].<ref name="pmid17109012">{{cite journal | author = Merlo LM, Pepper JW, Reid BJ, Maley CC | title = Cancer as an evolutionary and ecological process | journal = Nat. Rev. Cancer | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 924–35 | year = 2006 | month = December | pmid = 17109012 | doi = 10.1038/nrc2013 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Thorax pa peripheres Bronchialcarcinom li OF markiert.jpg|thumb|Chest x-ray showing lung cancer in the left lung.]]

Most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through [[cancer screening|screening]]. Neither of these lead to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a [[anatomical pathology|pathologist]]. People with suspected cancer are investigated with [[medical test]]s. These commonly include [[blood test]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] and [[endoscopy]].

===Classification===
{{further2|[[List of cancer types]]|[[List of oncology-related terms]]}}
Cancers are classified by the [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|type of cell]] that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor. These types include:
* [[Carcinoma]]: Cancers derived from [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers, particularly in the aged, and include nearly all those developing in the [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]], [[lung cancer|lung]], [[pancreas]], and [[Colorectal cancer|colon]].
* [[Sarcoma]]: Cancers arising from [[connective tissue]] (i.e. [[bone]], [[cartilage]], [[fat]], [[nerve]]), each of which develop from cells originating in [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]] cells outside the bone marrow.
* [[Lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]]: These two classes of cancer arise from hematopoietic ([[blood]]-forming) cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood, respectively. Leukemia is the most common type of [[childhood cancer|cancer in children]] accounting for about 30%.<ref>{{cite book |author=Varricchio, Claudette G. |title=A cancer source book for nurses |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2004 |page=229 |isbn=0-7637-3276-1 |oclc= |url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=jkqdgZcF9qcC&pg=PA229}}</ref>
* [[Germ cell tumor]]: Cancers derived from [[pluripotent]] cells, most often presenting in the [[testicular cancer|testicle]] or the [[ovarian cancer|ovary]] ([[seminoma]] and [[dysgerminoma]], respectively).
* [[Blastoma]]: Cancers derived from immature "precursor" cells or embryonic tissue. Blastomas are more common in children than in older adults.

Cancers are usually named using ''-carcinoma'', ''-sarcoma'' or ''-blastoma'' as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or tissue of origin as the root. For example, cancers of the liver [[parenchyma]] arising from malignant epithelial cells is called ''[[hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocarcinoma]]'', while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a [[hepatoblastoma]], and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a ''[[liposarcoma]]''. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of [[breast cancer]] is called ''[[mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinoma of the breast]]''. Here, the adjective ''ductal'' refers to the appearance of the cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts.

[[Benign tumor]]s (which are not cancers) are named using ''-oma'' as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a ''[[leiomyoma]]'' (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is ''[[uterine fibroid|fibroid]]''). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the ''-noma'' suffix, examples including [[melanoma]] and [[seminoma]].

Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as [[giant cell carcinoma]], [[spindle cell carcinoma]], and [[small-cell carcinoma]].

===Pathology===
The tissue [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] given by the pathologist indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its [[histological grade]], genetic abnormalities, and other features of the tumor. Together, this information is useful to evaluate the [[prognosis]] of the patient and to choose the best treatment. [[Cytogenetics]] and [[immunohistochemistry]] are other types of testing that the pathologist may perform on the tissue specimen. These tests may provide information about the molecular changes (such as [[mutation]]s, [[fusion gene]]s, and numerical [[chromosome]] changes) that has happened in the cancer cells, and may thus also indicate the future behavior of the cancer (prognosis) and best treatment.

==Screening==
{{Main|Cancer screening}}
Unlike diagnosis efforts prompted by [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign]]s, cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear.<ref name=NIH>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/overview/Patient |title=What Is Cancer Screening? |work=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=}}</ref> This may involve [[physical examination]], [[blood test|blood]] or [[urinalysis|urine tests]], or [[medical imaging]].<ref name=NIH/>

Cancer screening is currently not possible for many types of cancers, and even when tests are available, they may not be recommended for everyone. ''[[Universal screening]]'' or ''mass screening'' involves screening everyone.<ref name=Wilson>Wilson JMG, Jungner G. (1968) [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/php/WHO_PHP_34.pdf Principles and practice of screening for disease.] Geneva:[[World Health Organization]]. Public Health Papers, #34.</ref> ''Selective screening'' identifies people who are known to be at higher risk of developing cancer, such as people with a family history of cancer.<ref name=Wilson /> Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening.<ref name=NIH/> These factors include:
* Possible harms from the screening test: for example, X-ray images involve exposure to potentially harmful [[ionizing radiation]].
* The likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer.
* The likelihood of cancer being present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers.
* Possible harms from follow-up procedures.
* Whether suitable treatment is available.
* Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes.
* Whether the cancer will ever need treatment.
* Whether the test is acceptable to the people: If a screening test is too burdensome (for example, being extremely painful), then people will refuse to participate.<ref name=Wilson />
* Cost of the test.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of cancer}}

Many management options for cancer exist with the primary ones including [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[palliative care]]. Which treatments are used depends upon the type, location and grade of the cancer as well as the person's health and wishes.

===Palliative care===
[[Palliative care]] refers to treatment which attempts to make the patient feel better and may or may not be combined with an attempt to attack the cancer. Palliative care includes action to reduce the physical, emotional, spiritual, and psycho-social distress experienced by people with cancer. Unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve the patient's [[quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]].

Patients at all stages of cancer treatment need some kind of palliative care to comfort them. In some cases, [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] [[professional organizations]] recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care and not with cancer-directed therapy.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref> Those cases have the following characteristics:<ref>

#patient is ineligible to participate in any appropriate [[clinical trial]]<ref name="ASCOfive"/>  
#the physician sees no strong evidence that treatment would be effective<ref name="ASCOfive"/>  

Palliative care is often confused with [[hospice]] and therefore only involved when people approach [[End-of-life care|end of life]]. Like hospice care, palliative care attempts to help the person cope with the immediate needs and to increase the person's comfort. Unlike hospice care, palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at prolonging their lives or curing the cancer.

Multiple national [[medical guideline]]s recommend early palliative care for people whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea) or who need help coping with their illness. In people who have metastatic disease when first diagnosed, oncologists should consider a palliative care consult immediately. Additionally, an oncologist should consider a palliative care consult in any patient they feel has a prognosis of less than 12 months even if continuing aggressive treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/default.asp |title=NCCN Guidelines}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/guideline.pdf |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care |publisher = The National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care (NCP)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Levy MH, Back, A, Bazargan, S, Benedetti, C, Billings, JA, Block, S, Bruera, E, Carducci, MA, Dy, S, Eberle, C, Foley, KM, Harris, JD, Knight, SJ, Milch, R, Rhiner, M, Slatkin, NE, Spiegel, D, Sutton, L, Urba, S, Von Roenn, JH, Weinstein, SM, National Comprehensive Cancer Network | title = Palliative care.

===Surgery===
Surgery is the primary method of treatment of most isolated solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival.<!--<ref name=HollandTx40/> --> It is typically an important part of making the definitive diagnosis and staging the tumor as biopsies are usually required.<!--<ref name=HollandTx40/> --> In localized cancer surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with, in certain cases, the [[lymph node]]s in the area.<!--<ref name=HollandTx40/> --> For some types of cancer this is all that is needed to eliminate the cancer.<ref name=HollandTx40>Holland Chp. 40</ref>

===Chemotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] in addition to surgery has proven useful in a number of different cancer types including: [[breast cancer]], colorectal cancer, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[osteosarcoma|osteogenic sarcoma]], [[testicular cancer]], ovarian cancer, and certain lung cancers.<ref name=HollandTx40/> The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by toxicity to other tissues in the body.

===Radiation===
[[Radiation therapy]] involves the use of [[ionizing radiation]] in an attempt to either cure or improve the symptoms of cancer.<!--<ref name=H41/> --> It is used in about half of all cases and the radiation can be from either internal sources in the form of [[brachytherapy]] or external sources.<!--<ref name=H41/> --> Radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy but for certain types of cancer such as early [[head and neck cancer]] may be used alone.<!--<ref name=H41/> --> For painful [[bone metastasis]] it has been found to be effective in about 70% of people.<ref name=H41>Holland Chp. 41</ref>

===Alternative treatments===
[[Alternative cancer treatments|Complementary and alternative cancer treatments]] are a diverse group of health care systems, practices, and products that are not part of conventional medicine.<ref name="mnalt">{{cite journal | author = Cassileth BR, Deng G | title = Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer | journal = Oncologist | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14755017 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80 }}</ref> "Complementary medicine" refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while "alternative medicine" refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine.<ref>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/#2 What Is CAM?] [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. retrieved 3 February 2008.</ref> Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been rigorously studied or tested.

==Prognosis==
{{See also|Cancer survivor}}
{{See also|List of cancer mortality rates}}
Cancer has a reputation as a deadly disease. Taken as a whole, about half of people receiving treatment for invasive cancer (excluding [[carcinoma in situ]] and non-melanoma skin cancers) die from cancer or its treatment.<ref name=Epi11/> Survival is worse in the developing world.<ref name=Epi11/> However, the survival rates vary dramatically by type of cancer, with the range running from basically all people surviving to almost no one surviving.

Those who survive cancer are at increased risk of developing a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed with cancer.<ref name="isbn1-55009-213-8" /> The increased risk is believed to be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, partly due to the treatment for the first cancer, and potentially related to better compliance with screening.<ref name="isbn1-55009-213-8">{{cite book| editor=Frei, Emil; Kufe, Donald W.; Holland, James F.|author=Rheingold, Susan; Neugut, Alfred; Meadows, Anna| title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine| edition = 6th| publisher=BC Decker| location=Hamilton, Ont| year=2003| page=2399| isbn=1-55009-213-8|chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20948/| chapter=156: Secondary Cancers: Incidence, Risk Factors, and Management| accessdate=5 November 2009}}</ref>

Predicting either short-term or long-term survival is difficult and depends on many factors. The most important factors are the particular kind of cancer and the patient's age and overall health. People who are [[wikt:frailty|frail]] with many other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people. A [[centenarian]] is unlikely to survive for five years even if the treatment is successful. People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Montazeri A | title = Quality of life data as prognostic indicators of survival in cancer patients: an overview of the literature from 1982 to 2008 | journal = Health Qual Life Outcomes | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = | year = 2009 | month = December | pmid = 20030832 | pmc = 2805623 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7525-7-102 }}</ref> People with lower quality of life may be affected by [[major depressive disorder]] and other complications from cancer treatment and/or disease progression that both impairs their quality of life and reduces their quantity of life. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report a lower quality of life directly because they correctly perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal.

His contemporary [[Nicolaes Tulp]] believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was [[infectious disease|contagious]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Yalom|first=Marilyn|title=A history of the breast|year=1998|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-43459-3|edition=1st Ballantine Books ed.}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Though many diseases (such as [[heart failure]]) may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos. The [[euphemism]], "after a long illness" is still commonly used (2012), reflecting an apparent [[social stigma|stigma]].<ref>{{Cite news

Cancer is regarded as a disease that must be "fought" to end the "civil insurrection"; a [[War on Cancer]] has been declared. Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer's human effects, and they emphasize both the parlous state of the affected individual's health and the need for the individual to take immediate, decisive actions himself, rather than to delay, to ignore, or to rely entirely on others caring for him. The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments.<ref name=Gwyn>{{cite book

In the 1970s, a relatively popular [[alternative cancer treatment]] was a specialized form of [[talk therapy]], based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude.<ref name=Olson /> People with a "cancer personality"—depressed, repressed, self-loathing, and afraid to express their emotions—were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire. Some psychotherapists said that treatment to change the patient's outlook on life would cure the cancer.<ref name=Olson /> Among other effects, this belief allows society to [[Victim blaming|blame the victim]] for having caused the cancer (by "wanting" it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless, and loving person).<ref name=Ehrenreich /> It also increases patients' anxiety, as they incorrectly believe that natural emotions of sadness, anger or fear shorten their lives.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> The idea was excoriated by the notoriously outspoken [[Susan Sontag]], who published ''[[Illness as Metaphor]]'' while recovering from treatment for [[breast cancer]] in 1978.<ref name=Olson>{{cite book

In 2007, the overall costs of cancer in the U.S. — including treatment and indirect mortality expenses (such as lost productivity in the workplace) — was estimated to be $226.8 billion. In 2009, 32% of Hispanics and 10% of children 17 years old or younger lacked health insurance; "uninsured patients and those from ethnic minorities are substantially more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, when treatment can be more extensive and more costly."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/cancer-facts-figures-2012/ |title = Cancer Facts and Figures 2012 |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>

[[Experimental cancer treatment]]s are treatments that are being studied to see whether they work. Typically, these are studied in [[clinical trial]]s to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment.

Cancer research is the intense scientific effort to understand disease processes and discover possible therapies.

Research about cancer causes focuses on the following issues:
* Agents (e.g. viruses) and events (e.g. mutations) which cause or facilitate genetic changes in cells destined to become cancer.
* The precise nature of the genetic damage, and the genes which are affected by it.
* The consequences of those genetic changes on the biology of the cell, both in generating the defining properties of a cancer cell, and in facilitating additional genetic events which lead to further progression of the cancer.

The improved understanding of [[molecular biology]] and [[cell biology|cellular biology]] due to cancer research has led to a number of new treatments for cancer since U.S. President Nixon declared the "[[War on Cancer]]" in 1971. Since then, the U.S. has spent over $200 billion on cancer research, including resources from the public and private sectors and foundations.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sharon Begley | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/157548/page/2 |title=Rethinking the War on Cancer |date=16 September 2008 | work=Newsweek |accessdate=8 September 2008}}</ref> During that time, the country has seen a five percent decrease in the cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) between 1950 and 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/health/policy/24cancer.html |title=Advances Elusive in the Drive to Cure Cancer |last=Kolata|first=Gina|authorlink=Gina Kolata|date=23 April 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

==Pregnancy==
Because cancer is largely a disease of older adults, it is not common in pregnant women. Cancer affects approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnant women.<ref name=yarbro /> The most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in non-pregnant women during childbearing ages: breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer.<ref name=yarbro />

Diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.<ref name=yarbro /> As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women. Some imaging procedures, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRIs]] (magnetic resonance imaging), [[CT scan]]s, ultrasounds, and [[mammography|mammograms]] with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]] are not.<ref name=yarbro />

Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women.<ref name=yarbro /> However, radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery is generally safe, but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage. Some treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the [[first trimester]], increase the risk of [[birth defect]]s and [[pregnancy loss]] (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).<ref name=yarbro />

Elective [[abortion]]s are not required and, for the most common forms and stages of cancer, do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.<ref name=yarbro /> In a few instances, such as advanced uterine cancer, the pregnancy cannot be continued, and in others, such as an acute leukemia discovered early in pregnancy, the pregnant woman may choose to have abortion so that she can begin aggressive chemotherapy without worrying about birth defects.<ref name=yarbro />

Some treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed her baby.<ref name=yarbro /> Cervical cancer may require birth by Caesarean section. Radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of [[mastitis]]. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.<ref name=yarbro>{{cite book

==Other animals==

In non-humans, a few types of [[transmissible cancer]] have been described, wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves. This phenomenon is seen in dogs with [[Sticker's sarcoma]], also known as canine transmissible venereal tumor,<ref name="pmid16901782">{{cite journal | author = Murgia C, Pritchard JK, Kim SY, Fassati A, Weiss RA | title = Clonal origin and evolution of a transmissible cancer | journal = Cell | volume = 126 |issue = 3 | pages = 477–87 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16901782 | pmc = 2593932 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.051 }}</ref> as well as [[devil facial tumour disease]] in [[Tasmanian devil]]s.
