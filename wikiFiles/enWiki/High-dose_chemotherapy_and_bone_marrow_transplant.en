'''High-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant''' ('''HDC/BMT'''), also '''high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplant''' ('''HDC/ABMT''' or just '''ABMT'''), was a treatment regimen for [[metastatic breast cancer]], and later high-risk breast cancer, that was considered promising during the 1980s and 1990s.  It was ultimately determined to be no more effective than normal treatment, and to have significantly higher side effects, including treatment-related death.

From its birth in the 1980s to its [[denouement]] in the late 1990s, HDC/BMT transformed clinical practice, legislation on healthcare insurance coverage, public health policy and drove a two-decade long period of entrepreneurial [[oncology]]. It also gave rise to one of the most serious cases of [[research misconduct]] of the 20th century.<ref name=Rettig>{{cite book|title=False Hope: Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195187762|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=bbcTZLRRVmoC|author=Richard A.

==History of the treatment==
High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was a treatment developed in the 1980s<ref name=Weiss /> but had its antecedents in 1957 when [[E. Donnall Thomas]] had shown that bone marrow could be harvested from a patient and transplanted into the same or another patient.<ref name=Thomas>{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=E. Donnall|coauthors=Lochte H.L. Jr., Lu W.C., Ferrebee J.W.|title=Intravenous infusion of bone marrow in patients receiving radiation and chemotherapy|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=12 September 1957|volume=257|pages=491–496|doi=10.1056/NEJM195709122571102|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195709122571102|accessdate=23 December 2012|pmid=13464965}}</ref>

In HDC, the bone marrow transplantation was used to maximise chemotherapeutic dosage. By harvesting and freezing bone marrow, then implanting the marrow after HDC, doctors were theoretically able to break through the frontier of toxicity; the so-called "red ceiling". Early proponents of the technique were [[George Canellos]] and [[Emil Frei]] of the [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute]], and William Peters, whom Frei had recruited to the institute in 1982.<ref name=Hayes>{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Daniel|title=False Hope: Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=6 September 2007|volume=357|pages=1059–1060|doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev58584|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMbkrev58584|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref> Howard Skipper and Frank Schabel demonstrated efficacy in mouse models for megadose therapy in 1983.<ref name=Mukherjee>{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|title=The Emperor of All Maladies|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=9780007435814|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=wiJN_pHHLHsC}}</ref>

Frei and Peters developed the Solid Tumor Autologous Marrow Program (STAMP) regimen. By December 1984, 32 women had completed the Phase I study of the regimen, designed to investigate safety. The researchers proceeded with Phase II trials, which showed very promising results. However, only women who were healthier and responded better to conventional chemotherapy were eligible for the Phase II studies. The problem with Phase II studies was explained thus: {{quote|If you have a hundred patients and you give them a treatment applicable to all 100, and two are alive after 10 years, that is a 2% absolute survival rate. If you have 100 patients and you have a treatment applicable to 20 of the 100, and 20% of those 20 are alive after 10 years, that's only a 4% absolute survival rate, not a 20% survival rate.|Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, M.D.|Journal of the National Cancer Institute, July 5, 1995<ref name=Smigel />}} 

This [[selection bias]] makes the treatment look better, because candidates who would have fared better under any condition were selected. To belabour the point further Hortobagyi, using data from the [[University of Texas]] [[M. D. Anderson Cancer Center]] in [[Houston]], reported in May 1995 that patients eligible for high-dose chemotherapy survived 65% longer on ''conventional chemotherapy'' than those who would not have been eligible for the protocol.<ref name=Smigel /> Subsequent research on [[doxorubicin]]-containing protocols for the treatment of [[metastatic breast cancer]], found that median [[progression-free survival]] (PFS) was 16 and 8 months and median [[overall survival]] (OS) was 30 and 17 months, respectively for patients who met eligibility criteria versus those who did not, when all received the conventional treatment.<ref name=Rahman>{{cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Z.

Stage III [[randomised controlled trial]]s were needed to confirm the benefit of HDC/BMT.<ref name=Smigel>{{cite journal|last=Smigel|first=Kara|title=Women flock to ABMT for breast cancer without final proof|journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|date=5 July 1995|volume=87|issue=13|pages=953–5|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/13/952.full.pdf+html?ijkey=57384f11375606d7f00d8c73867ba80c0d30ff4b&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref> In 1985, William Peters left the Faber to set up the trial at [[Duke University]] in [[North Carolina]].

==Funding mechanisms and litigation==
Treatment remained exclusive of most patients due to high cost; $50,000 to $400,000 per patient. As long as HMOs regarded the regime as ''experimental'' or ''investigational'', there was no contractual obligation to cover it. This changed dramatically, in 1993, after a landmark court case, ''Fox v. Health Net''.<ref name=Mukherjee />

A public-school teacher named [[Nelene Fox]] was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991.<ref name=Rettig />{{rp|74}} Fox's brother, Mark Hiepler, took her [[HMO]], [[Health Net]], to court to force them to pay for HDC/BMT, which they had refused to do. Despite raising $220,000 herself and receiving the treatment regime, Fox died on April 22, 1993. Mark Hiepler sought damages from Health Net for delaying his sister's treatment. On December 28, Fox's family was awarded $89 million by a Californian jury.<ref name=Brownlee>{{cite news|last=Brownlee|first=Shannon|title=Bad Science and Breast Cancer|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2002/aug/featbad#.UNXuu3Nesco|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=Discover Magazine|date=1 August 2002|author2=Winters, Dan}}</ref> Between 1988 and 2002, 86 cases were filed to force HMOs to pay for transplants, of which 47 were successful.<ref name=Mukherjee /> The legislatures of [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire]], [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia]], and [[Minnesota Legislature|Minnesota]] mandated insurance coverage for all high-dose chemotherapy with ABMT or [[peripheral blood stem cell]] (PBSCT) transplant for women with breast cancer.<ref name=Smigel />

While, in the mid-1980s, fewer than 100 bone marrow transplants a year were performed on breast cancer patients,<ref name=Brownlee /> the uptake of HDC/BMT increased six-fold between January 1, 1989 and June 30, 1995. Between those dates 19,291 autotransplants were reported to the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry; 5,886 were for breast cancer. After 1992, breast cancer was the most common indication for autotransplant. Only 11% of women with stage 2/3 disease and less than one percent of those with stage 4 disease participated in randomized trials.<ref name=Antman>{{cite journal|last=Antman|first=K. H.|coauthors=P.

==Randomised controlled trials==
In May 1992, researchers from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (Wits) in [[South Africa]] presented early results of a randomised control trial (RCT) at the annual meeting of the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] (ASCO) in [[San Diego]]. The lead investigator was Werner Bezwoda, professor of [[haematology]] and [[oncology]] at Wits. This was the first scientific evidence of clinical benefit to emerge.<ref name=Bezwoda1992>{{cite journal|last=Bezwoda|first=Werner|coauthors=Seymour L., Vorobiof D.A.|title=High dose cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and VP-16 (HD-CNV) as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.|journal=Procedures of the American Society Clinical Oncology|year=1992|volume=11|issue=64|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>

The overall response rate for HD-CNV was 95%, with 23 of 45 patients achieving complete response (remission).<ref name=Bezwoda1995 />

The Journal of Clinical Oncology retracted the 1995 paper on April 26, 2001, concluding: "the trial was not conducted in a scientifically acceptable manner. The protocol was apparently written 9 years after the study was started and only after another study by the same investigator was to be audited. No patient signed a consent form, and there is little evidence of true randomisation."<ref name=Retraction1995>{{cite journal|title=Retraction for Bezwoda et al. 13 (10): 2483|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=1 June 2001|volume=19|issue=11|pages=2973|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/19/11/2973|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=McNamee>{{cite journal|last=McNamee|first=David|title=Cancer paper retracted|journal=The Lancet|date=28 April 2001|volume=357|issue=9265|pages=1343|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04535-9|url=http://lancetjournals.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)04535-9/fulltext?_eventId=login&version=printerFriendly|accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref> ASCO President [[Lawrence H.

High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation is no longer used.  It is an expensive and toxic treatment modality. Quality of life during treatment and in the first few months following treatment is worse than that of patients who receive conventional chemotherapy. Acute toxicities commonly include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, mucositis, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin abnormalities. Given these issues, the burden of proof for a benefit over standard treatments is high.<ref name=Rodenhuis>{{cite journal|last=Rodenhuis|first=S.|title=The Status of High-Dose Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer|journal=The Oncologist|year=2000|month=October|volume=5|issue=5|pages=369–375|doi=10.1634/theoncologist.5-5-369|url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/5/5/369.full|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref> High-dose therapy is also associated with an increase in second malignancies, including [[myelodysplastic syndromes]] and [[leukemias]].<ref name=Mukherjee />
