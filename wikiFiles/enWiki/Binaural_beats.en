'''Binaural beats''' or [[Sound localization|binaural]] tones are [[Sound|auditory]] processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, the [[perception]] of which arises in the brain for specific physical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. This effect was discovered in 1839 by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Dove]], and earned greater public awareness in the late 20th century based on claims that binaural [[Beat (acoustics)|beats]] could help induce relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental states. The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone: for example, if 300&nbsp;Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 10&nbsp;Hz.<ref name="pmid17309374">{{cite journal |author=Wahbeh H, Calabrese C, Zwickey H |title=Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess psychologic and physiologic effects |journal=Journal of alternative and complementary medicine |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |year=2007 |pmid=17309374 |doi=10.1089/acm.2006.6196}}</ref><ref name="pmid17388762">{{cite journal |author=Wahbeh H, Calabrese C, Zwickey H, Zajdel J |title=Binaural Beat Technology in Humans: A Pilot Study to Assess Neuropsychologic, Physiologic, And Electroencephalographic Effects |journal=Journal of alternative and complementary medicine |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=199–206 |year=2007 |pmid=17388762 |doi=10.1089/acm.2006.6201}}</ref>

The brain produces a phenomenon resulting in low-frequency pulsations in the [[amplitude]] and [[sound localization]] of a perceived sound when two tones at slightly different frequencies are presented separately, one to each of a subject's ears, using stereo [[headphones]]. A beating tone will be perceived, as if the two tones mixed naturally, out of the brain. The frequencies of the tones must be below 1,000 [[hertz]] for the beating to be noticeable.<ref name = "pmid4727697" /> The difference between the two frequencies must be small (less than or equal to 30&nbsp;Hz) for the effect to occur; otherwise, the two tones will be heard separately and no beat will be perceived.

Binaural beats are of interest to [[neurophysiologist]]s investigating the [[hearing (sense)|sense of hearing]].<ref name="pmid19506952">{{cite journal |author=Fitzpatrick D, et al|title=Processing Temporal Modulations in Binaural and Monaural Auditory Stimuli by Neurons in the Inferior Colliculus and Auditory Cortex |journal=JARO |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=579–593 |year=2009 |pmid=19506952 |doi=10.1007/s10162-009-0177-8}}</ref><ref name="pmid7860843">{{cite journal |author=Gu X, Wright BA, Green DM |title=Failure to hear binaural beats below threshold |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=701–703 |year=1995 |pmid=7860843 |doi=10.1121/1.412294}}</ref><ref name="pmid15615831">{{cite journal |author=Zeng F-G, et al |title=Perceptual Consequences of Disrupted Auditory Nerve Activity |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=3050–3063 |year=2005 |pmid=15615831 |doi=10.1152/jn.00985.2004}}</ref><ref>

== Acoustical background ==
[[File:Acoustics BinauralBeats.JPG|thumb|Interaural time differences (ITD) of binaural beats]]
For [[sound localization]] the human [[auditory system]] analyses [[interaural time difference]]s between both ears inside small frequency ranges, called [[critical band]]s. For frequencies below 1000 to 1500 [[hertz|Hz]] interaural time differences are evaluated from interaural phase differences between both ear signals.<ref>Blauert, J.: Spatial hearing - the psychophysics of human sound localization; MIT Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts (1983), ch. 2.4</ref>
The perceived sound is also evaluated from the analysis of both ear signals.

If different [[pure tone]]s ([[sinusoidal]] signals with different frequencies) are presented to each ear, there will be time dependent phase and time differences between both ears (see figure). The perceived sound depends on the frequency difference between both ear signals:
* If the frequency difference between the ear signals is lower than a few Hertz, the auditory system can follow the changes in the interaural time differences. As a result an [[auditory event]] is perceived, which is moving through the head. The perceived direction corresponds to the instantaneous interaural time difference.
* For slightly bigger frequency differences between the ear signals (more than 10&nbsp;Hz) the auditory system can no longer follow the changes in the interaural parameters. A diffuse auditory event appears. The sound corresponds to an overlay of both ear signals, which means amplitude and loudness are changing rapidly (see figure in the chapter above).
* For frequency differences between the ear signals of above 30&nbsp;Hz the [[cocktail party effect]] begins to work, and the auditory system is able to analyze the presented ear signals in terms of two different sound sources at two different locations, and two distinct signals are perceived.

Binaural beats can also  be experienced without headphones, they  appear when playing  two different pure tones through loudspeakers. The sound perceived is quite similar: with auditory events which move through the room, at low frequency differences, and diffuse sound at slightly bigger frequency differences. At bigger frequency differences apparent  localized sound sources appear.<ref>Slatky, Harald (1992): ''[http://www.cocktail-party-processor.de/english/algo/index.html Algorithms for direction specific Processing of Sound Signals - the Realization of a binaural Cocktail-Party-Processor-System]'', Dissertation, Ruhr-University Bochum, ch. 3</ref>
However, it is more effective to use headphones than loudspeakers.

== History ==
[[Heinrich Wilhelm Dove]] discovered binaural beats in 1839 and published his findings in his book Repertorium der Physik. While research about them continued after that, the subject remained something of a scientific curiosity until 134 years later, with the publishing of Gerald Oster's article "Auditory Beats in the Brain" (Scientific American, 1973). Oster's article identified and assembled the scattered islands of relevant research since Dove, offering fresh insight (and new laboratory findings) to research on binaural beats.

In particular,Oster saw binaural beats as a powerful tool for [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive and neurological research]], addressing questions such as how animals [[sound localization|locate sounds]] in their three-dimensional environment, and also the remarkable ability of animals to pick out and focus on specific sounds in a sea of noise (which is known as the "[[cocktail party effect]]").

Oster also considered binaural beats to be a potentially useful medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] tool, not merely for finding and assessing auditory impairments, but also for more general neurological conditions. (Binaural beats involve different neurological pathways than ordinary auditory processing.) For example, Oster found that a number of his subjects that could not perceive binaural beats, suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]]. In one particular case, Oster was able to follow the subject through a week-long treatment of Parkinson's disease; at the outset the patient could not perceive binaural beats; but by the end of the week of treatment, the patient was able to hear them.

In corroborating an earlier study, Oster also reported gender differences in the perception of beats. Specifically, women seemed to experience two separate peaks in their ability to perceive binaural beats—peaks possibly correlating with specific points in the [[menstrual cycle]], onset of menstruation and during the [[luteal phase]]. This data led Oster to wonder if binaural beats could be used as a tool for measuring relative levels of [[estrogen]].<ref name="pmid4727697"/>

The effects of binaural beats on consciousness were first examined by physicist [[Thomas Warren Campbell]] and electrical engineer Dennis Mennerich, who under the direction of [[Robert Monroe]] sought to reproduce a subjective impression of 4&nbsp;Hz oscillation that they associated with [[out-of-body experience]].<ref>"My Big TOE" book 1, Thomas Campbell, p79 ISBN 978-0-9725094-0-4</ref>  On the strength of their findings, Monroe created the binaural-beat technology self-development industry by forming [[The Monroe Institute]], now a charitable binaural research and education organization.

== Unverified claims ==
There have been a number of claims regarding binaural beats, among them that they may simulate the effect of recreational drugs, help people memorize and learn, stop smoking, help dieting, tackle erectile dysfunction and improve athletic performance.  
    
An [[Control (experiment)|uncontrolled]] [[pilot experiment|pilot study]] of 8 individuals indicated that binaural beats may have a relaxing effect. In absence of positive evidence for a specific effect, claimed effects may be attributed to the power of suggestion (the [[placebo effect]]).<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17309374 | doi=10.1089/acm.2006.6196 | volume=13 | issue=1 | title=Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess psychologic and physiologic effects | year=2007 | author=Wahbeh H, Calabrese C, Zwickey H | journal=J Altern Complement Med | pages=25–32}}</ref>

In a blind study (8 participants) of binaural beats' effects on meditation, 7&nbsp;Hz frequencies were found to enhance meditative focus while 15&nbsp;Hz frequencies harmed it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavallee|first=Christina F.|coauthors=Koren, Persinger|title=A Quantitative Electroencephalographic Study of Meditation and Binaural Beat Entrainment|journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|date=7|year=2011|month=April|volume=17|issue=4|pages=351–355|doi=10.1089/acm.2009.0691|pmid=21480784|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21480784|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>

== Physiology ==

The sensation of binaural beats is believed to originate in the [[Superior olivary complex|superior olivary nucleus]], a part of the [[brain stem]]. They appear to be related to the brain's ability to locate the sources of sounds in three dimensions and to track moving sounds, which also involves inferior colliculus (IC) neurons.<ref name="pmid9862906">{{cite journal |author=Spitzer MW, Semple MN |title=Transformation of binaural response properties in the ascending auditory pathway: influence of time-varying interaural phase disparity |journal=J.

== Hypothetical effects on brain function ==
{{details|brainwave synchronization}}

=== Overview ===
Binaural beats may influence functions of the brain in ways besides those related to hearing. This phenomenon is called ''frequency following response''.  The concept is that if one receives a stimulus with a frequency in the range of brain waves, the predominant brain wave frequency is said to be likely to move towards the frequency of the stimulus (a process called [[Brainwave synchronization|entrainment]]).<ref name="pmid46818">{{cite journal |author=Gerken GM, Moushegian G, Stillman RD, Rupert AL |title=Human frequency-following responses to monaural and binaural stimuli |journal=Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=379–86 |year=1975 |pmid=46818 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(75)90262-X}}</ref> In addition, binaural beats have been credibly documented to relate to both spatial perception & stereo auditory recognition, and, according to the frequency following response, activation of various sites in the brain.<ref name="pmid6158406">{{cite journal |author=Dobie RA, Norton SJ |title=Binaural interaction in human auditory evoked potentials |journal=Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology |volume=49 |issue=3-4 |pages=303–13 |year=1980 |pmid=6158406|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(80)90224-2}}</ref><ref name="pmid84739">{{cite journal |author=Moushegian G, Rupert AL, Stillman RD |title=Evaluation of frequency-following potentials in man: masking and clinical studies |journal=Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=711–18 |year=1978 |pmid=84739 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(78)90139-6}}</ref><ref name="pmid675250">{{cite journal |author=Smith JC, Marsh JT, Greenberg S, Brown WS |title=Human auditory frequency-following responses to a missing fundamental |journal=Science |volume=201 |issue=4356 |pages=639–41 |year=1978 |pmid=675250|doi=10.1126/science.675250}}</ref><ref name="pmid52439">{{cite journal |author=Smith JC, Marsh JT, Brown WS |title=Far-field recorded frequency-following responses: evidence for the locus of brainstem sources |journal=Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=465–72 |year=1975 |pmid=52439 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(75)90047-4}}</ref><ref name="pmid70337">{{cite journal |author=Yamada O, Yamane H, Kodera K |title=Simultaneous recordings of the brain stem response and the frequency-following response to low-frequency tone |journal=Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=362–70 |year=1977 |pmid=70337 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(77)90259-0}}</ref>

The stimulus does not have to be [[aural]]; it can also be visual<ref name="pmid17945633">{{cite journal |author=Cvetkovic D, Simpson D, Cosic I |title=Influence of sinusoidally modulated visual stimuli at extremely low frequency range on the human EEG activity |journal=Conference proceedings : ...

Perceived human hearing is limited to the range of frequencies from 20&nbsp;Hz to 20,000&nbsp;Hz, but the frequencies of human brain waves are below about 40&nbsp;Hz. To account for this lack of perception, binaural beat frequencies are used. Beat frequencies of 40&nbsp;Hz have been produced in the brain with binaural sound and measured experimentally.<ref name="pmid15721080">{{cite journal |author=Schwarz DW, Taylor P |title=Human auditory steady state responses to binaural and monaural beats |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=658–68 |year=2005 |pmid=15721080 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2004.09.014}}</ref>

When the perceived [[beat frequency]] corresponds to the [[delta wave|delta]], [[theta wave|theta]], [[alpha waves|alpha]], [[beta wave|beta]], or [[gamma wave|gamma]] range of [[Electroencephalography|brainwave]] frequencies, the brainwaves entrain to or move towards the beat frequency.<ref name="pmid-7300432">{{cite journal |author=Rogers LJ, Walter DO |title=Methods for finding single generators, with application to auditory driving of the human EEG by complex stimuli |journal=J.

(The precise boundaries between ranges vary among definitions, and there is no universally accepted standard.)

The dominant frequency determines your current state. For example, if in someone's brain alpha waves are dominating, they are in the alpha state (this happens when one is relaxed but awake). However, other frequencies will also be present, albeit with smaller amplitudes.

The brain entraining is more effective if the entraining frequency is close to the user's starting dominant frequency. Therefore, it is suggested to start with a frequency near to one's current dominant frequency (likely to be about 20&nbsp;Hz or less for a waking person), and then slowly decreasing/increasing it towards the desired frequency.

Some people find pure [[sine waves]] unpleasant, so a [[pink noise]] or another background (e.g. natural sounds such as river noises) can also be mixed with them. In addition to that, as long as the beat is audible, increasing the volume should not necessarily improve the effectiveness, therefore using a low volume is usually suggested. One theory is to reduce the volume so low that the beating should not even be clearly audible, but this does not seem to be the case (see the next paragraph).

In addition to lowering the brain frequency to relax the listener, there are other controversial, alleged uses for binaural beats.

A small media controversy was spawned in 2010 by an Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics official comparing binaural beats to illegal narcotics, and warning that interest in websites offering binaural beats could lead to drug use.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: Teens Using Digital Drugs to Get High|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/digital-drugs/|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=14 July 2010}}</ref>
