The '''causes of schizophrenia''' have been the subject of much debate, with various factors proposed and discounted or modified. The language of [[schizophrenia]] research under the medical model is scientific.  Such studies suggest that [[genetics]], prenatal development, early environment, [[neurobiology]] and psychological and social processes are important contributory factors. Currently, there are five different types of schizophrenia listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] titled: catatonic, residual, disorganized, undifferentiated, and paranoid.<ref>Carlson, N. R. (2010). Psychology, the science of behaviour. (4 ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.</ref> Current psychiatric research into the development of the disorder is often based on a [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|neurodevelopmental]] model  (proponents of which see schizophrenia as a syndrome.)<ref>http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/for/int//Murray/murray.asp as at 12-8-10</ref><ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7321/full/nature09552.html</ref> However, schizophrenia is diagnosed on the basis of [[Syndrome|symptom profiles]].

Although no common cause of schizophrenia has been identified in all individuals diagnosed with the condition, currently most researchers and clinicians believe it results from a combination of both [[human brain|brain]] vulnerabilities (either inherited or acquired) and life events. This widely adopted approach is known as the 'stress-vulnerability' model,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zubin J, Spring B |title=Vulnerability--a new view of schizophrenia |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=103–26 |year=1977 |month=April |pmid=858828 |doi= 10.1037/0021-843X.86.2.103|url=}}</ref> and much scientific debate now focuses on how much each of these factors contributes to the development and maintenance of schizophrenia. 

It is possible for schizophrenia to develop at any age, but it mostly happens to people within the ages of 16-40 - about 75 percent of people living with the illness develops it at this age. There is a likelihood of children developing schizophrenia, though it is quite rare before the age of 12. Also, new cases are uncommon after age 40. In addition, about 1 percent of the world's population will develop schizophrenia over their lifetime, therefore out of all the people born, one in 100 will develop schizophrenia by age 55. <ref>Schizophrenia society of canada.

There is on average a somewhat earlier onset for men than women, with the possible influence of the female hormone [[estrogen]] being [[Schizophrenia and the Effects of Estrogen on Schizophrenia|one hypothesis]] and sociocultural influences [[Social construction of schizophrenia|another]].<ref>Age of menarche and schizophrenia onset in women Schizophrenia Research, Volume 69, Issues 2-3, 1 August 2004, Pages 183-188

== Genetics ==
Evidence suggests that genetic vulnerability and environmental factors can act in combination to result in diagnosis of schizophrenia.<ref name=fn_12>{{cite journal |author=Harrison PJ, Owen MJ |title=Genes for schizophrenia? Recent findings and their pathophysiological implications |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9355 |pages=417–9 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12573388 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12379-3 |url=}}</ref> Although schizophrenia is strongly heritable, there is also evidence that not all cases are caused by heredity.  Many people who appear to carry "schizophrenia genes" do not become schizophrenic. <ref>Carlson, Neil R. (2013). "Physiology of Behavior" (11th ed.) p.568. </ref>  Recent research suggests that genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia is [[Multifactorial inheritance|multifactorial]], caused by interactions of several [[genes]].<ref name=fn_75>{{cite journal |author=Owen MJ, Craddock N, O'Donovan MC |title=Schizophrenia: genes at last? |journal=Trends Genet |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=518–25 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16009449 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.06.011 |url=}}</ref>

[[Reelin]] is a crucial factor for long term potentiation. Within the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients, levels of mRNA expressing this were found to be over 50% less than controls. Deficits are also observed in bipolar and autistic people. However, antipsychotics also effect reelin expression, so this data may be of some question. Regardless, how these drugs affect this signalling cascade is the mechanism of their long term effects upon the brain.

Both individual [[twin studies]] and meta-analyses of twin studies estimate the [[heritability]] of risk for schizophrenia to be approximately 80% (this refers to the proportion of variation between individuals in a population that is influenced by genetic factors, not the degree of genetic determination of individual risk). Concordance rates between monozygotic twins was close to 50%; whereas dizygotic twins was 17%.  Adoption studies have also indicated a somewhat increased risk in those with a parent with schizophrenia even when raised apart. Studies suggest that the [[phenotype]] is genetically influenced but not genetically determined; that the variants in genes are generally within the range of normal human variation and have low risk associated with them each individually; and that some interact with each other and with environmental risk factors; also they might not be specified to schizophrenia.<ref name=fn_79/> 

Some [[twin studies]]<ref name=fn_10>{{cite journal |author=Koskenvuo M, Langinvainio H, Kaprio J, Lönnqvist J, Tienari P |title=Psychiatric hospitalization in twins |journal=Acta Genet Med Gemellol (Roma) |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=321–32 |year=1984 |pmid=6540965 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=fn_11>{{cite journal |author=Hoeffer A, Pollin W |title=Schizophrenia in the NAS-NRC panel of 15,909 veteran twin pairs |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=469–77 |year=1970 |month=November |pmid=5478575 |doi= |url=}}</ref> have found rates as low as 11.0%&ndash;13.8% among monozygotic twins, and 1.8%&ndash;4.1% among dizygotic twins, however.

</ref> Yet, in the "Pairs of Veteran Twins" study, for example, 338 pairs were schizophrenic with only 26 pairs concordant, and it was concluded in one report: "the role of the suggested genetic factor appears to be a limited one; 85 percent of the affected monozygotic pairs in the sample were discordant for schizophrenia".<ref>WILLIAM POLLIN M.D., MARTIN G.

For example, although the concordance of schizophrenia occurrence in monozygotic twins has traditionally been used to estimate a genetic component to the illness, the results could be skewed because of environmental factors like a shared placenta<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pearce B D | year = 2001 | title = Schizophrenia and viral infection during neurodevelopment: a focus on mechanisms | url = | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 6| pages = 634–646 }}</ref><ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin#Monochorionic</ref><ref>''Schizophr Bull.'' 1995;21(3):357-66.

In fact, researchers have used the phenomenon of 'fetal programming' to account for familial patterns in epidemiological studies.  "Intra-uterine growth is a complex outcome that is influenced by a wide range of factors including fetal genotype, maternal physiology and behaviour as well as the function of that crucial interface—the placenta," said one journal.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/1/96 }} as at 12-08-10 - note one of the authors of the referenced schizophrenia study was Robin Murray</ref>

Family studies indicate that the closer a person’s genetic relatedness to a person with schizophrenia, the greater the likelihood of developing the disorder. The paternal age is a factor in schizophrenia because of the increased likelihood of mutations in the chromosomes of cells that produce sperms.  In contrast, women's oocytes divide twenty-three times before the time of birth and only once after that.  The chance of a copying error in DNA replication during cell division increases with the number of cell divisions, and an increase in copying errors may cause an accumulation of mutations that are responsible for an increased incidence of schizophrenia.<ref>Carlson, Neil R. (2013). "Physiology of Behavior" (11th ed.) p.568.</ref>  The average concordance rates are higher for identical twins than for fraternal twins and evidence also suggests that the prenatal and perinatal environments may also affect concordance rates in identical twins. <ref> Schacter, Daniel L., “Psychology”, 2010 </ref>

After reviewing techniques like: Genome Wide Association Studies; Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Copy Number Variations; the journal Nature journal reports: the basic observation is that,  "You have this clear tangible phenomenon in which children resemble their parents"...."Despite what children get told in elementary school science we just don't know how that works," as Professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton, Leonid Kruglyak, says (in reviewing heretability in general).<ref>Maher, Brendan; "The case of the missing hereditability"; NEWS FEATURE PERSONAL GENOMES NATURE|Vol 456|6 November 2008 p21</ref>  It cites schizophrenia as a trait in which the genes have gone missing.

A great deal of effort has been put into [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] studies of schizophrenia, which attempt to identify specific genes which may increase risk. A 2003 review of [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] studies listed seven genes as likely to increase risk for a later diagnosis of the disorder.<ref name=fn_12/> Two recent reviews<ref name=fn_75/><ref name=fn_79>{{cite journal |author=Riley B, Kendler KS |title=Molecular genetic studies of schizophrenia |journal=Eur J Hum Genet |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=669–80 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16721403 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201571 |url=}}</ref> suggested that the evidence was strongest for two genes known as [[dysbindin]] (''DTNBP1'') and [[neuregulin]] ([[NRG1]]), and that a number of other genes (such as ''[[COMT]]'', ''[[RGS4]]'', ''[[PPP3CC]]'', ''[[ZDHHC8]]'', ''[[DISC1]]'', and ''[[AKT1]]'') showed some early promising results.

The largest most comprehensive genetic study of its kind, involving tests of several hundred [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) in nearly 1,900 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 2,000 comparison subjects, reported in 2008 that there was no evidence of any significant association between the disorders and any of 14 previously identified [[candidate gene]]s (''[[RGS4]]'', ''[[DISC1]]'', ''[[DTNBP1]]'', ''[[STX7]]'', ''[[TAAR6]]'',
''[[PPP3CC]]'', ''[[NRG1]]'', ''[[DRD2]]'', ''[[HTR2A]]'', ''[[DAOA]]'', ''[[AKT1]]'', 
''[[CHRNA7]]'', ''[[COMT]]'', and ''[[ARVCF]]''). The statistical distributions suggested nothing more than chance variation. The authors concluded that the findings make it unlikely that common SNPs in these genes account for a substantial proportion of the genetic risk for schizophrenia, although small effects could not be ruled out.<ref>

Other research has suggested that a greater than average number of rare deletions or duplications of tiny DNA sequences within genes (known as [[Gene copy number|copy number variants]]) are linked to increased risk for schizophrenia, especially in those "sporadic" cases not linked to family history of schizophrenia, and that the genetic factors and developmental pathways can thus be different in different individuals.<ref name="Walsh T_et_al_2008">{{cite journal

CNVs occur due to [[non-allelic homologous recombination]] mediated by [[low copy repeats]] (sequentially similar regions). This results in deletions and duplications of dosage sensitive genes. It has been speculated that CNVs underlie a significant proportion of normal human variation, including differences in cognitive, behavioral, and psychological features, and that CNVs in at least three loci can result in increased risk for schizophrenia in a few individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee JA, Lupski JR |title=Genomic rearrangements and gene copy-number alterations as a cause of nervous system disorders |journal=Neuron |volume=52 |pages=103–121 |year=2006 |pmid=17015230 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.027 |issue=1}}</ref>

"The SFU group found that variations in four sets of [[genes]] are related to both [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]].

In February 28, 2013 The Lancet published an article about the possible genetic correlation between autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. They analyzed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestry. The lead researcher was Dr. Jordan Smoller, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Smoller's group found four gene areas that all overlapped with the five disorders, two of which regulate calcium balance in the brain.<ref>http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2962129-1/fulltext</ref>

== Evolutionary psychology ==
Schizophrenia has been considered an evolutionary puzzle due to the combination of high heritability, relatively high prevalence, and reduced reproductive success. One explanation could be increased reproductive success by close relatives without symptoms but this does not seem to be the case. Still, it has been argued that it is possible that a low amount of [[schizotypy]] increasing genes may increase reproductive success by increasing such traits such as creativity, verbal ability, and emotional sensitivity.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0016040}}</ref>  

Another evolutionary explanations is the "[[imprinted brain theory]]"  which argues that psychosis and [[autism]] are contrasting disorders on a number of different variables. This is argued to be caused by an unbalanced [[genomic imprinting]] favoring paternal genes in the case of autism and maternal genes in the case of psychosis.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/a0024043}}</ref>

==Prenatal==
It is well established that [[obstetric]] complications or events are associated with an increased chance of the child later developing schizophrenia, although overall they constitute a non-specific risk factor with a relatively small effect. Obstetric complications occur in approximately 25 to 30% of the general population and the vast majority do not develop schizophrenia, and likewise the majority of individuals with schizophrenia have not had a detectable obstetric event. Nevertheless, the increased average risk is well-replicated, and such events may moderate the effects of genetic or other environmental risk factors. The specific complications or events most linked to schizophrenia, and the mechanisms of their effects, are still under examination.<ref name=Clarke2006>

===Fetal growth===
Lower than average birth weight has been one of the most consistent findings, indicating slowed fetal growth possibly mediated by genetic effects. In the first and only prospective study of the low birthweight,  schizophrenia, and enlargement of brain ventricles suggestive of cerebral atrophy,  Leigh Silverton and colleagues found that low birthweight (measured prospectively with regard to psychopathology) was associated with enlarged ventricles on CT-Scans in a sample at risk for schizophrenia over 30 years later.  These signs suggestive of cerebral atrophy were associated with schizophrenia symptoms.<ref name="low birthweight and cerebral atrophy in schizophrenia">{{cite journal|last=Silverton|first=Leigh|coauthors=Finello,Schulsinger, Mednick|title=Low birth weight and ventricular enlargement in a high-risk sample|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1984|volume=94|series=3|issue=3|pages=405–409.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1986-01378-001}}</ref> In a follow up study, Silverton et al.  noted an interaction between genetic risk for schizophrenia and low birthweight. The risk of  enlarged ventricles on brain scan  (associated with schizophrenia symptoms and biologically suggestive of [[Emil Kraepelin]]'s dementia praecox type of schizophrenia ) was greatly increased if the subjects had both a higher genetic load for schizophrenia and lower birthweight. The investigators suggested that in utero insults may specifically stress those with a schizophrenia diathesis suggesting to the authors a diathesis stress etiological model for a certain type of schizophrenia  (that Kraepelin identified) with early abnormalities suggesting brain atrophy.<ref name="GXE interactions in ventricular">{{cite journal|last=Silverton|first=Leigh|coauthors=Mednick, Schulsinger, Parnas, Harrington|title=Gentic risk for schizophrenia, birthweight, and cerebral ventricular enlargement.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1988|month=Nov|volume=97|series=97|issue=3|pages=496–498|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.97.4.496|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/97/4/496/|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>   

Some investigators have noted, however, that any factor adversely affecting the fetus will affect growth rate, however, so believe that this association has may not be particularly informative regarding causation.<ref name=Clarke2006/> In addition, the majority of birth cohort studies have failed to find a link between schizophrenia and low birth weight or other signs of growth retardation.<ref name=Welham2008/> It should be noted, however, that the majority of studies do not measure the interaction of genetic risk and birthweight as was done in the Silverton et al. studies. 

Animal models have suggested links between intrauterine growth restriction and specific neurological abnormalities similar to those that may be involved in the development of schizophrenia, including ventricular enlargement and reduced hippocampal volume in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mallard EC, Rehn A, Rees S, Tolcos M, Copolov D |title=Ventriculomegaly and reduced hippocampal volume following intrauterine growth-restriction: implications for the aetiology of schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr.

===Hypoxia===
It has been hypothesized since the 1970s that brain [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low oxygen levels) before, at or immediately after birth may be a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Handford HA |title=Brain hypoxia, minimal brain dysfunction, and schizophrenia |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=192–4 |year=1975 |month=February |pmid=1111324 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1111324}}</ref><ref>The above reference is cited in a 2006 work, in giving a history of minimal brain dysfunction saying: "It was also noted that individuals who experienced perinatal brain hypoxia constituted a population at risk for minimal brain dysfunction, and that children attending psychiatric clinics often presented with illnesses or perinatal complications of a sort known to be associated with neurological brain damage (Handford 1975)."Disorganized Children : A Guide for Parents and Professionals Jessica Kingsley Publishers Ltd.

Hypoxia is now being demonstrated as relevant to schizophrenia in animal models, molecular biology and epidemiology studies.  One study in Molecular Psychiatry was able to differentiate 90% of schizophrenics from controls based on hypoxia and metabolism.<ref>Prabakaran, S., Swatton, J. E., Ryan, M. M., Huffaker, S.

Although most studies have interpreted hypoxia as causing some form of neuronal dysfunction or even subtle damage, it has been suggested that the physiological hypoxia that prevails in normal embryonic and fetal development, or pathological hypoxia or [[ischemia]], may exert an effect by regulating or dysregulating genes involved in neurodevelopment. A literature review judged that over 50% of the [[candidate gene]]s for susceptibility to schizophrenia met criteria for "ischemia–hypoxia regulation and/or [[vascular]] expression" even though only 3.5% of all genes were estimated to be involved in hypoxia/ischemia or the vasculature.<ref name=kastner>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt-Kastner R, van Os J, W M Steinbusch H, Schmitz C |title=Gene regulation by hypoxia and the neurodevelopmental origin of schizophrenia |journal=Schizophrenia research |volume=84 |issue=2–3 |pages=253–71 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16632332 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2006.02.022 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920996406001113}}</ref>

Research on [[rodents]] seeking to understand the possible role of prenatal hypoxia in disorders such as schizophrenia has indicated that it can lead to a range of sensorimotor and learning/memory abnormalities. Impairments in motor function and coordination, evident on challenging tasks when the hypoxia was severe enough to cause brain damage, were long-lasting and described as a "hallmark of prenatal hypoxia".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Golan H, Huleihel M |title=The effect of prenatal hypoxia on brain development: short- and long-term consequences demonstrated in rodent models |journal=Developmental science |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=338–49 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16764607 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00498.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118633736/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Golan H, Kashtutsky I, Hallak M, Sorokin Y, Huleihel M |title=Maternal hypoxia during pregnancy delays the development of motor reflexes in newborn mice |journal=Developmental neuroscience |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15509895 |doi=10.1159/000080708 |url=}}</ref> 

Several animal studies have indicated that fetal hypoxia can affect many of the same neural substrates implicated in schizophrenia, depending on the severity and duration of the hypoxic event as well as the period of gestation, and in humans moderate or severe (but not mild) fetal hypoxia has been linked to a series of motor, language and cognitive deficits in children, regardless of genetic liability to schizophrenia.<ref>Ellman, LM and Cannon TD, "Chapter 7.

Whereas most studies find only a modest effect of hypoxia in schizophrenia, a longitudinal study using a combination of indicators to detect possible fetal hypoxia, such as early equivalents of Neurological Soft Signs or obstetric complications, reported that the risk of schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychoses was "strikingly elevated" (5.75% versus 0.39%).  Although objective estimates of hypoxia did not account for all schizophrenic cases; the study revealed increasing odds of schizophrenia according to graded increase in severity of hypoxia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zornberg GL, Buka SL, Tsuang MT |title=Hypoxic-ischemia-related fetal/neonatal complications and risk of schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychoses: a 19-year longitudinal study |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=196–202 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10671387 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.2.196|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10671387}}</ref>

===Other factors===
There is an emerging literature on a wide range of prenatal risk factors, such as prenatal stress, intrauterine (in the [[womb]]) malnutrition, and prenatal infection. [[Paternal age effect|Increased paternal age]] has been linked to schizophrenia, possibly due to "chromosomal aberrations and mutations of the aging germline."<ref name="Torrey-2009">{{Cite journal | author = Torrey EF, Buka S, Cannon TD, Goldstein JM, Seidman LJ, Liu T, Hadley T, Rosso IM, Bearden C, Yolken RH | title = Paternal age as a risk factor for schizophrenia: how important is it? | journal = Schizophr Res | volume = 114 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 1–5 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2009.06.017 | pmid = 19683417 | url = http://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964%2809%2900290-4/abstract }}</ref> Maternal-fetal rhesus or genotype incompatibility has also been linked, via increasing the risk of an adverse prenatal environment. Also, in mothers with schizophrenia, an increased risk has been identified via a complex interaction between maternal genotype, maternal behavior, prenatal environment and possibly medication and socioeconomic factors.<ref name=Clarke2006/> References for many of these environmental risk factors have been collected in an online database.<ref>[http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/schizrisk.html Environmental risk factors and comorbid medical conditions in schizophrenia]</ref>

There may be an association between [[celiac disease]] ([[gluten]] intolerance) and schizophrenia in a small proportion of patients, though large [[randomized controlled trials]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies will be needed before such an association can be confirmed. Withdrawal of gluten from the diet is an inexpensive measure which may improve the symptoms in a small (≤3%) number of schizophrenic patients.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16423158}}</ref>

The dopamine hypothesis states that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are caused by hyperactivity of dopaminergic synapses in the mesolimbic system, which targets the nucleus accumbens and amygdala.  This hypothesis was inspired by the evidence that dopamine antagonists alleviate the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and they may even increase or produce them.  The involvement of dopamine in reinforcement could plausibly explain the positive effects of schizophrenia.  There is no evidence that an abnormally large amount of dopamine is released under resting conditions, but PET studies indicate that the administration of amphetamine causes a larger release of dopamine in the schizophrenic brain. <ref>Carlson, Neil R. (2013). "Physiology of Behavior" (11th ed.) p.568.</ref>

It is a [[pathogenic theory of disease]] in which it is thought that a proximal cause of certain cases of [[schizophrenia]] is the interaction of the developing fetus with [[pathogen]]s  such as [[virus]]es, or with [[antibodies]] from the mother created in response to these pathogens (in particular, [[Interleukin 8]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=AS|coauthors=Hooton, J, Schaefer, CA, Zhang, H, Petkova, E, Babulas, V, Perrin, M, Gorman, JM, Susser, ES|title=Elevated maternal interleukin-8 levels and risk of schizophrenia in adult offspring|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=2004 May|volume=161|issue=5|pages=889–95|pmid=15121655|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.5.889}}</ref> Substantial research suggests that exposure to certain illnesses (e.g., influenza) in the mother of the neonate (especially at the end of the second trimester) causes defects in neural development which may emerge as a predisposition to schizophrenia around the time of puberty, as the brain grows and develops.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=AS|title=Prenatal Infection as a Risk Factor for Schizophrenia|journal=Schizophrenia bulletin|date=2006 Apr|volume=32|issue=2|pages=200–2|pmid=16469941|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj052|pmc=2632220}}</ref>

== Childhood antecedents ==
In general, the antecedents of schizophrenia are subtle and those who will go on to develop schizophrenia do not form a readily identifiable subgroup - which would lead to identification of a specific cause. Average group differences from the norm may be in the direction of superior as well as inferior performance. Overall, birth cohort studies have indicated subtle nonspecific behavioral features, some evidence for psychotic-like experiences (particularly hallucinations), and various cognitive antecedents. There have been some inconsistencies in the particular domains of functioning identified and whether they continue through childhood and whether they are specific to schizophrenia.<ref name=Welham2008>{{cite journal |author=Welham J, Isohanni M, Jones P, McGrath J |title=The Antecedents of Schizophrenia: A Review of Birth Cohort Studies |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume= 35|issue= 3|pages= 603–23|year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18658128 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn084 |url= |pmc=2669575}}</ref>

A prospective study found average differences across a range of developmental domains, including reaching milestones of motor development at a later age, having more speech problems, lower educational test results, solitary play preferences at ages four and six, and being more socially anxious at age 13.

Symptoms of schizophrenia often appear soon after puberty, when the brain is undergoing significant maturational changes.  Some investigators believe that the disease process of schizophrenia begins prenatally, lies dormant until puberty, and then causes a period of neural degeneration that causes the symptoms to emerge.<ref>Carlson, Neil R.

== Substance use ==
The relationship between schizophrenia and drug use is complex, meaning that a clear causal connection between drug use and schizophrenia has been difficult to tease apart. There is strong evidence that using certain drugs can trigger either the onset or relapse of schizophrenia in some people. It may also be the case, however, that people with schizophrenia use drugs to overcome negative feelings associated with both the commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication and the condition itself, where negative emotion, [[paranoia]] and [[anhedonia]] are all considered to be core features.

The rate of substance use is known to be particularly high in this group. In a recent study, 60% of people with schizophrenia were found to use substances and 37% would be diagnosable with a substance use disorder.<ref name=fn_74>{{cite journal |author=Swartz MS |title=Substance use in persons with schizophrenia: baseline prevalence and correlates from the NIMH CATIE study |journal=J.

=== Cannabis ===
There is some evidence that [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use can contribute to schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that cannabis is neither a [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|sufficient nor necessary]] factor in developing schizophrenia, but that cannabis may [[Statistical significance|significantly]] increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and may be, among other things, a significant causal factor. Nevertheless, some previous research in this area has been criticised as it has often not been clear whether cannabis use is a cause or effect of schizophrenia. To address this issue, a recent review of studies from which a causal contribution to schizophrenia can be assessed has suggested that cannabis statistically doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia on the individual level, and may, assuming a causal relationship, be responsible for up to 8% of cases in the population.<ref name=pmid14754822>{{cite journal |author=Arseneault L, Cannon M, Witton J, Murray RM |title=Causal association between cannabis and psychosis: examination of the evidence |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=184 |issue= 2|pages=110–7 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14754822 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.184.2.110 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/184/2/110}}</ref>

===Amphetamines and other stimulants===
{{Main|Stimulant psychosis}}
As amphetamines trigger the release of dopamine and excessive dopamine function is believed to be responsible for many symptoms of schizophrenia (known as the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]]), amphetamines may worsen schizophrenia symptoms.<ref>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Aug 20;93(17):9235-40.Single photon emission computerized tomography imaging of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in drug-free schizophrenic subjects.Laruelle M, Abi-Dargham A, van Dyck CH, Gil R, D'Souza CD, Erdos J, McCance E, Rosenblatt W, Fingado C, Zoghbi SS, Baldwin RM, Seibyl JP, Krystal JH, Charney DS, Innis RB.

===Hallucinogens===
{{see also|LSD and schizophrenia}}
Drugs such as [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], and [[LSD]] have been used to mimic schizophrenia for research purposes. Using LSD and other [[psychedelics]] as a model has now fallen out of favor with the [[scientific research community]], as the differences between the drug induced states and the typical presentation of schizophrenia have become clear. The [[dissociatives]] ketamine and PCP, however, are still considered to produce states that are remarkably similar, and are considered to be even better models than stimulants since they produce both positive and negative symptoms.

===Alcohol===
Approximately three percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, [[gene expression]], as well as [[thiamin]] deficiency. There is evidence that [[alcohol abuse]] via a [[kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling mechanism]] can occasionally cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia.<ref name=emedicine>{{EMedicine|med|3113|Alcohol-Related Psychosis}}</ref>

Despite the higher prevalence of tobacco smoking, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have a much lower than average chance of developing and dying from [[lung cancer]]. While the reason for this is unknown, it may be because of a genetic resistance to the cancer, a side effect of drugs being taken, or a statistical effect of increased likelihood of dying from causes other than lung cancer.<ref name=fn_49>"''Conditions in Occupational Therapy: effect on occupational performance.''" ed.

Furthermore, many people with schizophrenia have smoked tobacco products long before they are diagnosed with the illness, and a cohort study of Israeli conscripts found that healthy adolescent smokers were more likely to develop schizophrenia in the future than their nonsmoking peers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mark Weiser, M.D., Abraham Reichenberg, Ph.D., Itamar Grotto, M.D., Ross Yasvitzky, B.Sc., Jonathan Rabinowitz, Ph.D., Gad Lubin, M.D., Daniella Nahon, M.A., Haim Y.

It is of interest that cigarette smoking affects liver function such that the [[antipsychotic drugs]] used to treat schizophrenia are broken down in the blood stream more quickly. This means that smokers with schizophrenia need slightly higher doses of antipsychotic drugs in order for them to be effective than do their non-smoking counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The increased rate of smoking in schizophrenia may be due to a desire to self-medicate with [[nicotine]]. One possible reason is that smoking produces a short term effect to improve alertness and cognitive functioning in persons who suffer this illness.<ref name=compton_2005>{{cite web | last = Compton | first = Michael T. | title = Cigarette Smoking in Individuals with Schizophrenia | publisher = Medscape Psychiatry & Mental Health | date = 2005-11-16 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/516304_print | accessdate = 2007-05-17 }}</ref> It has been postulated that the mechanism of this effect is that people with schizophrenia have a disturbance of nicotinic receptor functioning which is temporarily abated by tobacco use.<ref name=compton_2005/>  However, some researchers have questioned whether self-medication is really the best explanation for the association.<ref>http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910940707 Chambers, R.A.

Specific social experiences have been linked to specific psychological mechanisms and psychotic experiences in schizophrenia. In addition, structural neuroimaging studies of victims of sexual abuse and other traumas have sometimes reported findings similar to those sometimes found in psychotic patients, such as thinning of the corpus callosum, loss of volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, and reduced hippocampal volume.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bentall RP, Fernyhough C |title=Social Predictors of Psychotic Experiences: Specificity and Psychological Mechanisms |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume= 34|issue= 6|pages= 1012–20|year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18703667 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn103 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/sbn103v1 |pmc=2632492}}</ref>

===Urbanicity===
A particularly stable and replicable finding has been the association between living in an [[Urbanization|urban]] environment and the development of schizophrenia, even after factors such as [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], [[ethnic group]] and size of [[social group]] have been controlled for.<ref name=fn_19>{{cite journal |author=van Os J |title=Does the urban environment cause psychosis? |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=184 |issue= 4|pages=287–8 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15056569 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.184.4.287|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15056569}}</ref> A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in [[Sweden]] found a 68%&ndash;77% increased risk of diagnosed [[psychosis]] for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be described as schizophrenia.<ref name=fn_20>{{cite journal |author=Sundquist K, Frank G, Sundquist J |title=Urbanisation and incidence of psychosis and depression: follow-up study of 4.4 million women and men in Sweden |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=184 |issue= 4|pages=293–8 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15056572 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.184.4.293|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15056572}}</ref>

Various possible explanations for the effect have been judged unlikely based on the nature of the findings, including infectious causes or a generic stress effect. It is thought to interact with genetic dispositions and, since there appears to be nonrandom variation even across different neighborhoods, and an independent association with social isolation, it has been proposed that the degree of "social capital" (e.g. degree of mutual trust, bonding and safety in neighborhoods) can exert a developmental impact on children growing up in these environments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krabbendam L, van Os J |title=Schizophrenia and urbanicity: a major environmental influence—conditional on genetic risk |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=795–9 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16150958 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbi060 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/31/4/795#BIB37}}</ref>

===Close relationships===
Evidence is consistent that negative attitudes from others increase the risk of schizophrenia relapse, in particular critical comments, hostility, authoritarian, and intrusive or controlling attitudes (termed 'high expressed emotion' by researchers).<ref name=fn_70>{{cite journal |author=Bebbington P, Kuipers L |title=The predictive utility of expressed emotion in schizophrenia: an aggregate analysis |journal=Psychol Med |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=707–18 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=7991753 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291700027860|url=}}</ref> Although family members and significant others are not held responsible for schizophrenia - the attitudes, behaviors and interactions of all parties are addressed - unsupportive dysfunctional relationships may also contribute to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia.<ref name=Bentall_et_al_2007>{{cite journal |author=Bentall RP |coauthors=Fernyhough C, Morrison AP, Lewis S, Corcoran R |year=2007 |title=Prospects for a cognitive-developmental account of psychotic experiences |journal=Br J Clin Psychol |volume=46 | issue=Pt 2 |pages=155–73 |pmid=17524210 | doi = 10.1348/014466506X123011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Subotnik, KL |coauthors=Goldstein, MJ, Nuechterlein, KH, Woo, SM and Mintz, J |year=2002 |title=Are Communication Deviance and Expressed Emotion Related to Family History of Psychiatric Disorders in Schizophrenia? |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=719–29 |pmid=12795501}}</ref> The risk of developing schizophrenia can also be increased by an individual developing a very low sense of self, in which ones boundaries become confused with that of the mother and/ or father.

== Synergistic effects ==
Experiments on mice have provided evidence that several stressors can act together to increase the risk of schizophrenia. In particular, the combination of an maternal infection during pregnancy followed by heightened stress at the onset of sexual maturity markedly increase the probability that a mouse develops symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas the occurrence of one of these factors without the other does not.<ref>[http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/archive_articles/130301_schizophrenie_per/index_EN Malign environmental combination favours schizophrenia ], ETH Zürich, 28 February 2013</ref><ref>S.

== Other proposed etiologies ==
Psychiatrists [[R. D. Laing]], [[Silvano Arieti]], [[Theodore Lidz]] and others have argued that the symptoms of what is called mental illness are comprehensible reactions to impossible demands that society and particularly family life places on some sensitive individuals. Laing, Arieti and Lidz were notable in valuing the ''content'' of [[psychosis|psychotic]] experience as worthy of interpretation, rather than considering it simply as a secondary and essentially meaningless marker of underlying psychological or neurological distress. Laing described eleven case studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and argued that the content of their actions and statements was meaningful and logical in the context of their family and life situations.<ref>R.D. Laing's and Aaron Esterson. ''Sanity, Madness and the Family'' (1964)</ref> 

In 1956, [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues [[Paul Watzlawick]], [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], and [[Jay Haley]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bateson G, Jackson DD, Haley J, Weakland JH|year=1956 |title=Toward a theory of schizophrenia |journal=Behavioral Science |volume=1 |pages=251–264 |doi=10.1002/bs.3830010402 |issue=4}}</ref> articulated a theory of schizophrenia, related to Laing's work, as stemming from [[double bind]] situations where a person receives different or contradictory messages. Madness was therefore an expression of this distress and should be valued as a [[catharsis|cathartic]] and transformative experience. In the books ''Schizophrenia and the Family'' and ''The Origin and Treatment of Schizophrenic Disorders'' Lidz and his colleagues explain their belief that parental behaviour can result in mental illness in children. Arieti's ''[[Interpretation of Schizophrenia]]'' won the 1975 scientific [[National Book Award]] in the United States.

The concept of schizophrenia as a result of civilization has been developed further by psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]''; he proposed that until the beginning of historic times, schizophrenia or a similar condition was the normal state of human consciousness.<ref name="Jaynes1976">{{cite book |author =Jaynes J |title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1976 |isbn=0-395-20729-0}}</ref> This would take the form of a "[[bicameral mind]]" where a normal state of low affect, suitable for routine activities, would be interrupted in moments of crisis by "mysterious voices" giving instructions, which early people characterized as interventions from the gods. Researchers into [[shaman]]ism have speculated that in some cultures schizophrenia or related conditions may predispose an individual to becoming a shaman;<ref name="fn_57">{{cite journal |author=Polimeni J, Reiss JP |title=How shamanism and group selection may reveal the origins of schizophrenia |journal=Med.

Modern clinical psychological research has indicated a number of processes which may cause or bring on episodes of schizophrenia. 

A number of [[cognitive bias]]es and deficits have been identified. These include attribution biases in social situations, difficulty distinguishing inner speech from speech from an external source (source monitoring), difficulty in adjusting speech to the needs of the hearer, difficulties in the very earliest stages of processing visual information (including reduced [[latent inhibition]]), and an [[attentional bias]] towards threats.

Some of these tendencies have been shown to worsen or appear when under emotional stress or in confusing situations.

A number of emotional factors have been implicated in schizophrenia, with some models putting them at the core of the disorder. It was thought that the appearance of blunted affect meant that sufferers did not experience strong emotions, but more recent studies indicate there is often a normal or even heightened level of emotionality, particularly in response to negative events or stressful social situations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen AS, Docherty NM |title=Affective reactivity of speech and emotional experience in patients with schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr Res |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15145465 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(03)00069-0 |url=}}</ref> Some theories suggest positive symptoms of schizophrenia can result from or be worsened by negative emotions, including depressed feelings and low [[self-esteem]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith B |title=Emotion and psychosis: links between depression, self-esteem, negative schematic beliefs and delusions and hallucinations |journal=Schizophr Res |volume=86 |issue=1–3 |pages=181–8 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16857346 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2006.06.018 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Fowler DG |author3=Freeman D |display-authors=3 |last4=Bebbington |first4=Paul |last5=Bashforth |first5=Hannah |last6=Garety |first6=Philippa |last7=Dunn |first7=Graham |last8=Kuipers |first8=Elizabeth}}</ref> and feelings of vulnerability, inferiority or [[loneliness]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beck AT |year=2004 |url=http://www.atypon-link.com/SPC/doi/abs/10.1891/jcop.18.3.281.65649?cookieSet=1&journalCode=jcop |title=A cognitive model of schizophrenia |journal=Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=281–8 |doi= 10.1891/jcop.18.3.281.65649}}</ref> Chronic negative feelings and maladaptive coping skills may explain some of the association between psychosocial stressors and symptomology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horan WP, Blanchard JJ |title=Emotional responses to psychosocial stress in schizophrenia: the role of individual differences in affective traits and coping |journal=Schizophr Res |volume=60 |issue=2–3 |pages=271–83 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12591589 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(02)00227-X }}</ref> Critical and controlling behaviour by significant others (high [[expressed emotion]]) causes increased emotional arousal<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tarrier N, Turpin G |title=Psychosocial factors, arousal and schizophrenic relapse.

Countries or cultures where schizotypal personalities or schizophrenia symptoms are more accepted or valued appear to be associated with reduced onset of, or increased recovery from, schizophrenia.

Related studies suggest that the content of delusional and psychotic beliefs in schizophrenia can be meaningful and play a causal or mediating role in reflecting the life history, or social circumstances of the individual.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birchwood M, Meaden A, Trower P, Gilbert P, Plaistow J |title=The power and omnipotence of voices: subordination and entrapment by voices and significant others |journal=Psychol Med |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=337–44 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10824654 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291799001828 |url=}}</ref> Holding minority socio-cultural beliefs, for example due to ethnic background, has been linked to increased diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Psychiatrist [[Tim Crow]] has argued that schizophrenia may be the evolutionary price we pay for a left brain hemisphere specialization for [[language]].<ref name="fn_56">{{cite journal |author=Crow TJ |title=Schizophrenia as failure of hemispheric dominance for language |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=339–43 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9246721  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166223697010710 |accessdate=2008-07-07 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01071-0}}</ref> Since psychosis is associated with greater levels of right brain hemisphere activation and a reduction in the usual left brain hemisphere dominance, our language abilities may have evolved at the cost of causing schizophrenia when this system breaks down.

In [[alternative medicine]], some practitioners believe that there are a vast number of physical causes of what ends up being diagnosed as schizophrenia.<ref>http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/causesofschizophrenia.htm Twenty-Nine Medical Causes of "Schizophrenia" Excerpted from Nutrition and Mental Illness by the late Carl C. Pfeiffer, Ph.D., M.D.  Accessed 06-22-2011</ref> While some of these explanations may stretch credulity, others (such as heavy metal poisoning and nutritional imbalances) have been supported at least somewhat by research.<ref name="Opler2004" /><ref>{{Cite pmid|7177508}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|15006495}}</ref> However, it is not entirely clear how many (if any) patients initially diagnosed with schizophrenia these alternative explanations may account for.
