'''Freund's adjuvant''' is a solution of [[antigen]] [[emulsification|emulsified]] in [[mineral oil]] and used as an [[immunopotentiator]] (booster). The '''complete form''', Freund's Complete Adjuvant,(CFA{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} or FCA{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}) is composed of inactivated and dried [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] (usually ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis|M. tuberculosis]]''), whereas the '''incomplete form''' (IFA{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} or FIA{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}) lacks the mycobacterial components (hence just the water in oil emulsion). It is named after [[Jules T. Freund]].

==Regulation==
Freund's complete adjuvant is effective in stimulating [[cell-mediated immunity]] and may lead to the potentiation of the production of certain [[immunoglobulin]]s, but this effect depends on the [[animal model]] used. Its use in humans is forbidden by regulatory authorities, due to its [[toxicity]]. Even for animal research there are currently [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]] associated with its use, due to its [[pain]]ful reaction and potential for tissue damage. Injections of CFA should be subcutaneous or intraperitoneal, because intradermal injections may cause [[skin ulcer]]ation and [[necrosis]]; intramuscular injections may lead to temporary or permanent [[muscle]] lesion, and intravenous injections may produce pulmonary lipid [[embolism]].<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

When administered to mice, in some laboratory experiments Freund's complete adjuvant was said to have prevented [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|juvenile-onset diabetes]]<ref>{{Citation | surname=Sadelain | given=M.W., et al. | title=Prevention of type I diabetes in NOD mice by adjuvant immunotherapy | journal=Diabetes |volume=39 | year=1991 | pages=583–589 | url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/39/5/583 | pmid=2139617 | doi=10.2337/diabetes.39.5.583 | last1=Sadelain | first1=MW | last2=Qin | first2=HY | last3=Lauzon | first3=J | last4=Singh | first4=B | issue=5 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | surname=Qin | given=H.Y., et al. | title=Complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced T cells prevent the development and adoptive transfer of diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice | journal=J.

It has also been investigated in an animal model of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="pmid17023164">{{Citation |author=Armentero MT, Levandis G, Nappi G, Bazzini E, Blandini F |title=Peripheral inflammation and neuroprotection: systemic pretreatment with complete Freund's adjuvant reduces 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease |journal=Neurobiol.

===Mechanism===
FCA is known to stimulate production of [[Tumor necrosis factors|tumor necrosis factor]], which is thought to kill the [[T-cells]] responsible for the [[autoimmune]] destruction of the pancreatic [[Beta cells]]. Still in question is whether the regrowth of functional [[insulin]]-producing cells occurs due to [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] and [[cell division|proliferation]] of existing [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[adult stem cells|stem cells]], or whether the injected spleen cells re-differentiate to an insulin-producing form.  [[Denise Faustman]], whose work has been central to developing the protocol, has suggested that both mechanisms may play a role. However, in experiments to verify and examine her work, Suri reported that DNA-based evidence yielded no sign of spleen cell derivatives in [[pancreatic]] [[Islets of Langerhans|islet]] [[Beta cells]] analyzed after treatments.<ref>{{Citation | surname=Suri | given=A., et al. | title=Immunological Reversal of Autoimmune Diabetes Without Hematopoietic Replacement of β Cells  | journal=Science |volume=311 | year=2006 | pages=1778–1780 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5768/1778 | pmid=16556846 | doi=10.1126/science.1123500 | last1=Suri | first1=A | last2=Calderon | first2=B | last3=Esparza | first3=TJ | last4=Frederick | first4=K | last5=Bittner | first5=P | last6=Unanue | first6=ER | issue=5768 }}</ref>
