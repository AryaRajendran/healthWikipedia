In [[anatomy]], the '''splenic artery''' (in the past called the '''lienal artery''') is the [[blood vessel]] that supplies oxygenated [[blood]] to the [[spleen]].  It branches from the [[celiac artery]], and follows a course [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|superior]] to the [[pancreas]].  

==Branches==

The splenic artery gives off branches to the [[stomach]] and pancreas before reaching the spleen. 

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Branch''' || '''Description'''
 |- 
 | [[Pancreatic branches of splenic artery|branch to the pancreas]] || Multiple branches serving the [[pancreas]]. The largest is the [[arteria pancreatica magna]]
 |- 
 | [[Short gastric arteries|short gastric]] || upper part of [[greater curvature of the stomach]]
 |- 
 | [[left gastroepiploic artery|left gastroepiploic]] || middle of greater curvature of the [[stomach]]
 |-
 | [[Posterior gastric artery|posterior gastric]] || posterior of [[stomach]], gastric region superior to the splenic artery
|}

Note that the branches of the splenic artery do not reach all the way to the lower part of the greater curvature of the stomach. Instead, that region is supplied by the [[right gastroepiploic artery]], a branch of the [[gastroduodenal artery]]. The two gastroepiploic arteries [[anastomose]] with each other at that point.

==Vein==
Along its course, it is accompanied by a similarly named vein, the [[splenic vein]], which drains into the [[portal vein]].  

==Pathology==
Splenic artery [[aneurysm]]s are rare{{ref|Abbas}}, but still the third most common abdominal aneurysm{{ref|Jamsheer}} (after aneurysms of the [[abdominal aorta]] and [[iliac artery|iliac arteries]]).

They may occur in pregnant women in the 3rd trimester and rupture carries a maternal mortality of greater than 50% and a fetal mortality of 70% - 90%. Risk factors include smoking and high blood pressure.{{ref|Suzuki}}
