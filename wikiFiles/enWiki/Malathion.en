'''Malathion''' is an [[organophosphate]] [[parasympathomimetic]] which binds irreversibly to [[cholinesterase]]. Malathion is an [[insecticide]] of relatively low human [[toxicity]].
In the former [[USSR]], it was known as '''carbophos''', in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] as '''maldison''' and in [[South Africa]] as '''mercaptothion'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/malathion.html |title=alanwood.net |accessdate=2007-09-16 |work=}}</ref>

==Pesticide use==
Malathion is a pesticide that is widely used in agriculture, residential landscaping, public recreation areas, and in public health pest control programs such as mosquito eradication.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/health/mosquitoes/malathion4mosquitoes.htm#malathion Malathion for mosquito control], US EPA</ref>  In the US, it is the most commonly used organophosphate insecticide.<ref name="pmid17720683">{{cite journal |author=Bonner MR |title=Malathion Exposure and the Incidence of Cancer in the Agricultural Health Study |journal= American Journal of Epidemiology|volume= 166|issue=  9|pages=1023–1034|year=2007 |pmid=17720683 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwm182 |author-separator=, |author2=Coble J |author3=Blair A |display-authors=3 |last4=Beane Freeman |first4=L.

Malathion was used in the 1980s in [[California]] to combat the [[Mediterranean Fruit Fly]]. This was accomplished on a wide scale by the near weekly [[Aerial application|aerial spraying]] of suburban communities for a period of several months. Formations of three or four [[Agricultural aircraft|agricultural helicopters]] would overfly suburban portions of Alameda County, [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[San Mateo County]], [[Santa Clara County]], [[San Joaquin County]], [[Stanislaus County]], and [[Merced County]] <!-- other counties too? --> releasing a mixture of malathion and [[corn syrup]], the corn syrup being a bait for the fruit flies. Malathion has also been used to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly in Australia.<ref name="pmid16914134">{{cite journal |author=Edwards JW, Lee SG, Heath LM, Pisaniello DL |title=Worker exposure and a risk assessment of malathion and fenthion used in the control of Mediterranean fruit fly in South Australia |journal=Environ.

Malathion was sprayed in many cities to combat [[West Nile virus]]. In the Fall of 1999 and the Spring of 2000, [[Long Island]] and the five boroughs of [[New York City]] were sprayed with several pesticides, one of which was malathion. While it was claimed by some anti-pesticide groups that use of these pesticides caused a lobster die-off in Long Island Sound, there is no conclusive evidence yet to support this.<ref>[http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/LILobsters/Oct04Meeting/summaries/LISLISummary-Pesticides.pdf ModelContaminants_Toxic Effec<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Manitoba]] ordered the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] to be sprayed in July 2005 as part of the [[West Nile virus]] campaign. Prior to this, malathion was used over the last couple of decades on a regular basis during summer months to kill nuisance mosquitoes, but homeowners were allowed to exempt their properties if they chose. Today, [[Winnipeg]] is the only major city in [[Canada]] with an ongoing Malathion nuisance-adult-mosquito-control program.<ref>[http://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/bugline/mosquitoes/policy.stm Winnipeg.ca-UD: Public Works: Insect Control Branch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.podolsky.ca/gary/Malathionwinnipeg.htm Malathion winnipeg<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Medical use==
Malathion in low doses (0.5% preparations) is used as a treatment for:

* [[Head lice]] and [[body lice]].  Malathion is approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] for treatment of [[pediculosis]].<ref>[http://guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=12784 National Guideline Clearinghouse | Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pediculosis capitis (head lice) in children and adults 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="McMichaelHordinsky2008">{{cite book|author1=Amy J.

==Risks==

===General===
Malathion itself is of low toxicity; however, absorption or ingestion into the human body readily results in its metabolism to [[malaoxon]], which is substantially more toxic.<ref name=REL/>  In studies of the effects of long-term exposure to oral ingestion of malaoxon in rats, malaoxon has been shown to be 61 times more toxic than malathion.<ref name=REL>{{cite journal |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/REDs/malathion_red.pdf |title=Reregistration  Eligibility Decision for Malathion |journal=US Environmental Protection Agency - Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances EPA 738-R-06-030   journal |author=Edwards D  |pages=9 |year=2006}}</ref>  It is cleared from the body quickly, in three to five days.<ref name="Maugh II">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/16/science/la-sci-pesticides-20100517 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Thomas H. | last=Maugh II | title=Study links pesticide to ADHD in children | date=16 May 2010}}</ref>  
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] there is currently no reliable information on adverse health effects of chronic exposure to malathion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg154.html |title=US Department of Health and Human Services: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry - Medical Management Guidelines for Malathion |accessdate=2008-04-02 |work=}}</ref> Acute exposure to extremely high levels of malathion will cause body-wide symptoms whose intensity will be dependent on the severity of exposure. Possible symptoms include skin and eye irritation, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating, seizures and even death. Most symptoms tend to resolve within several weeks.  Malathion present in untreated water is converted to malaoxon during the chlorination phase of water treatment, so malathion should not be used in waters that may be used as a source for drinking water, or any upstream waters.

If malathion is used in an indoor, or other poorly ventilated environment, it can seriously poison the occupants living or working in this environment. A possible concern is that malathion being used in an outdoor environment, could enter a house or other building; however, studies by the EPA have conservatively estimated that possible exposure by this route is well below the toxic dose of malathion.<ref name="REL"/> Regardless of this fact, in jurisdictions which spray malathion for pest control, it is often recommended to keep windows closed and air conditioners turned off while spraying is taking place, in an attempt to minimize entry of malathion into the closed environment of residential homes. 

In 1981, the late [[B. T. Collins]],<ref name='CADI-BTC'>{{cite web |url=http://www.ancestry.com |title=California Death Index, 1940-1997 [Database Online] |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=The Generations Network |location=Provo, Utah |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2009-12-14 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref> Director of the California Conservation Corps, publicly swallowed and survived a mouthful of dilute Malathion solution.  This was an attempt to demonstrate Malathion's safety following an outbreak of Mediterranean fruit flies in California.  Malathion was sprayed over a {{convert|1400|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} area to control the flies.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jordan |last=Bonfante |title=Medfly Madness |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,969129,00.html |work=TIME |date=1990-01-08 |accessdate=May 21, 2009}}</ref>

In 1976, numerous [[malaria]] workers in [[Pakistan]] were poisoned by [[isomalathion]], a contaminant that may be present in some preparations of malathion.<ref name="pmid74508">{{cite journal |author=Baker EL |title=Epidemic malathion poisoning in Pakistan malaria workers |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8054 |pages=31–4 |year=1978 |pmid=74508 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(78)90375-6|author-separator=, |author2=Warren M |author3=Zack M |display-authors=3 |last4=Dobbin |first4=RD |last5=Miles |first5=JW |last6=Miller |first6=S |last7=Alderman |first7=L |last8=Teeters |first8=WR}}</ref> It is capable of inhibiting [[carboxyesterase]] enzymes in those exposed to it. It was discovered that poor work practices had resulted in excessive direct skin contact with isomalathion contained in the malathion solutions. Implementation of good work practices, and the cessation of use of malathion contaminated with isomalathion led to the cessation of poisoning cases.

===Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder===

A May 2010 study found that in a representative sample of US children, those with higher levels of organophosphate pesticide metabolites in their urine were more likely to have [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], but no causal relationship was established.<ref name=Bouchard>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1542/peds.2009-3058 | title = Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Urinary Metabolites of Organophosphate Pesticides | year = 2010 | last1 = Bouchard | first1 = M.

G. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 125 | issue = 6 | pages = e1270–7 | pmid = 20478945}}</ref>  Each 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites was associated with a 55% to 72% increase in the odds of ADHD.  The  study was the first investigation on children's neurodevelopment to be conducted in a group with no particular pesticide exposure.<ref name=Bouchard/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/721892 | title = Organophosphate Pesticides Linked to ADHD | publisher = Medscape Today | date =  May 17, 2010 | accessdate = Dec. 11, 2012}}</ref>

===Carcinogenicity===
Whether malathion is carcinogenic or not in humans is unknown.  Malathion is classified by US EPA as having "suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential."<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/REDs/malathion_red.pdf Reregistration Eligibility Decision for Malathion], US EPA</ref> This classification was based on the occurrence of liver tumors at excessive doses in mice and female rats and the presence of rare oral and nasal tumors in rats that occurred following exposure to very large doses.  Researchers conducted a study involving participants from six Canadian provinces and found that exposure to organophosphates as a group and malathion alone was associated with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. Malathion used as a fumigant was not associated with increased cancer risk.  Between 1993 and 1997, as part of the Agricultural Health Study, researchers surveyed 19,717 pesticide applicators about their past pesticide exposures and health histories and no clear association between malathion exposure and cancer was reported.<ref>[http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/malatech.html Malathion Technical Fact Sheet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Amphibians===

Although current EPA regulations do not require amphibian testing, a 2008 study done by the University of Pittsburgh found that "cocktails of contaminants", which are frequently found in nature, were lethal to leopard frog tadpoles. They found that a combination of five widely used insecticides ([[carbaryl]], [[chlorpyrifos]], [[diazinon]], [[endosulfan]], and malathion) in concentrations far below the limits set by the EPA killed 99% of leopard frog tadpoles.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081111183041.htm | title = Low Concentrations Of Pesticides Can Become Toxic Mixture For Amphibians | publisher = Science Daily | date = Nov. 18, 2008 | accessdate = Dec. 11, 2012}}</ref>
