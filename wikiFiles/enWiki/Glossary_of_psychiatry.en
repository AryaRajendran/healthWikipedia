Neurosci. |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=531–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16958934 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2006.01576.x }}</ref>

For example, a person may see written "No Trespassing" on a board and may infer from this that intelligence agencies are spying on him.

===Aphemia===
Aphemia is the alternate term for [[mutism]]. Mutism is absence of speech with apparently normal level of consciousness. Mutism can be dissociative (hysterical) in which an individual (commonly a child or adolescent) stops speaking at once without involvement of any neurological or physical contributing factor; or it can be elective (selective) in which a child does not speak at all in certain situations (such as in school) but speaks well in other conditions (like at home or at play). A rare cause of mutism is akinetic mutism which results due to a [[lesion]] around 3rd [[ventricular system|ventricle]] of brain.

===Apperception===
Apperception is a normal phenomenon and refers to the ability to understand sensory inputs in their context, to interpret them and to incorporate them into experience. Failure of apperception is seen in [[delirium|delirious]] states.

Astasia-abasia is a form of psychogenic gait disturbance in which gait becomes impaired in the absence of any neurological or physical pathology. The person usually walks in a bizarre manner. He staggers and appears as if going to fall but always manages to catch hold of something in time.

===Asyndesis===
Alternate term for Loosening of association. A milder form of derailment of thought, in which a person goes on jumping  from one topic to another and there is little connection among the topics.

Capgras Syndrome and several other related disorders are referred to as [[delusional misidentification syndrome]].

The syndrome is named after [[Joseph Capgras]] (1873–1950), a French psychiatrist who first described the disorder in a paper by Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux1,2 in 1923. They used the term ''l'illusion des sosies'' (the illusion of doubles) to describe the case of a French woman who complained that various ''doubles'' had taken the place of people she knew. However, the term illusion has a subtly different meaning from delusion in psychiatry so ''[[Capgras delusion]]'' is used as a more suitable name.

Impaired [[perception]] functioning leads to [[illusions]] and [[hallucinations]] often in the visual sensory modality. This then causes agitation and distress and secondary [[delusions]]. The term 'confusion state' is sometimes used to mean clouding of consciousness, but should be avoided if at all possible because it is ambiguous.

===Dermatozoenwahn===
Alternate term for organic hallucinosis and [[delusional parasitosis]], the continuous belief on the part of the patient that their skin or body has been infested by parasites or insects. This state cannot be diagnosed if the hallucinatory state is produced while the patient is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or if the patient fulfills the criterion for [[delirium tremens|delirium]].

===Folie à deux===
{{Main|Folie_à_deux}}
Also called induced psychosis, folie à deux is a delusional disorder shared by two or more people who are closely related emotionally.

;Folie simultanée
In ''folie simultanée'', or subtype B of ''folie a deux'', a delusional system emerges simultaneously and independently in two closely related persons, and the separation of the two would not be beneficial in the resolution of psychopathology.
