Nine out of ten Sjögren's patients are women<ref name="SSFabout">{{cite web|url=http://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens-syndrome|title=About Sjögren's Syndrome|publisher=[[Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation]]}}</ref><ref name="williams">{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Venus-Williams-pulls-out-of-U-S-Open?urn=ten-wp2840|title=Venus Williams pulls out of U.S. Open due to autoimmune disease|author=Chris Chase|publisher=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=31 August 2011}}</ref> and the average age of onset is after menopause in women, although Sjögren's occurs in all age groups in both women and men.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} It is estimated to affect as many as 4 million people in the United States alone, making it the second most common rheumatic disease.

Sjögren's syndrome can exist as a disorder in its own right (primary Sjögren's syndrome) or may develop years after the onset of an associated rheumatic disorder, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[scleroderma]], [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] etc. (secondary Sjögren's syndrome).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The disorder should not be confused with the [[Sjögren–Larsson syndrome]], which was also denoted ''T. Sjögren syndrome'' in early studies. It shares clinical features with, and is sometimes concurrent with [[benign lymphoepithelial lesion]] or Mikulicz disease. They are, however, considered distinct entities.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The hallmark symptom of Sjögren's syndrome is a generalized [[Dryness (medical)|dryness]], typically including [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth) and [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] (dry eyes), part of what are known as sicca symptoms. Sicca syndrome also incorporates vaginal dryness, chronic bronchitis and lacks signs of arthritis. Sjögren's syndrome may cause [[human skin|skin]], [[human nose|nose]], and [[vaginal dryness]], and may affect other organs of the body, including the [[kidney]]s, [[blood vessel]]s, [[Human lung|lung]]s, [[liver]], [[pancreas]], [[peripheral nervous system]] (distal axonal sensorimotor neuropathy) and [[Human brain|brain]].

Sjögren's syndrome is associated with increased levels in [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) of [[IL-1RA]], an [[interleukin 1]] antagonist. This suggests that the disease begins with increased activity in the interleukin 1 system, followed by an auto-regulatory up-regulation of IL-1RA to reduce the successful binding of interleukin 1 to its receptors. It is likely that interleukin 1 is the marker for fatigue, however, increased IL-1RA is observed in the CSF and is associated with increased [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] through [[cytokine]] induced [[sickness behavior]].<ref>Harboe E, Tjensvoll AB, Vefring HK, Gøransson LG, Kvaløy JT, Omdal R. (2009). Fatigue in primary Sjögren's syndrome—a link to sickness behaviour in animals? Brain Behav Immun.23(8):1104–8. {{doi|10.1016/j.bbi.2009.06.151}} PMID 19560535</ref> On the other hand, Sjögren's syndrome is characterized by decreased levels of IL-1ra in saliva, which could be responsible for mouth inflammation and dryness.<ref>Perrier S, Coussedière C, Dubost JJ, Albuisson E, Sauvezie B. (1998) IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) gene polymorphism in Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 87(3):309-13> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9646842</ref> Patients with secondary Sjögren's syndrome also often exhibit signs and symptoms of their primary rheumatic disorders, such as SLE, Rheumatoid Arthritis or Systemic Sclerosis.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:SSA SSB ANA.jpg|thumb|[[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SS-A]] and SS-B antibodies on HEp-20-10 cells. This combination of autoantibodies is common in Sjögren's syndrome.]]Diagnosing Sjögren's syndrome is complicated by the range of symptoms a patient may manifest, and the similarity between symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome and those of other conditions. Nevertheless, the combination of several tests can lead to a diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome.

Blood tests can be done to determine if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as [[anti-nuclear antibody]] (ANA) and [[rheumatoid factor]] (because SS frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with [[autoimmune diseases]]. Typical Sjögren's syndrome ANA patterns are [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SSA/Ro]] and SSB/La, of which SSB/La is far more specific; SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions but are often present in Sjögren's.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Franceschini F, Cavazzana I |title=Anti-Ro/SSA and La/SSB antibodies |journal=Autoimmunity |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=55–63 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15804706 |doi=10.1080/08916930400022954 |url=}}</ref>

[[Schirmer's test]] measures the production of tears: a strip of filter paper is held inside the lower eyelid for five minutes, and its wetness is then measured with a ruler. Producing less than five millilitres of liquid is usually indicative of Sjögren's syndrome. However, lacrimal function declines with age or may be impaired from other medical conditions. An alternative test is ''nonstimulated whole saliva flow collection'', in which the patient spits into a test tube every minute for 15 minutes. A resultant collection of less than 1.5 mL is considered a positive result.<ref>Kruszka, P.; O'Brian, R. (2009). [http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0315/p465.html "Diagnosis and management of Sjögren syndrome"]. ''American Family Physician'' '''79''' (6): 465–470. PMID 19323359.</ref> It takes longer to perform than Schirmer's test, but does not require special equipment.

A [[slit lamp|slit-lamp examination]] can reveal dryness on the surface of the eye. Salivary gland function can be tested by collecting saliva and determining the amount produced in a five minute period. A lip [[biopsy]] can reveal [[lymphocyte]]s clustered around salivary glands, and damage to these glands due to inflammation.

Ultrasound examination of the salivary glands is the simplest confirmatory test and has the added advantage of being non-invasive with no complications. The parenchyma of the gland demonstrates multiple, small-2-6&nbsp;mm hypoechoic lesions which are representations of the lymphocytic infiltrates. Often sialectasis with calculi are demonstrated if the disease is advanced. The sonographic findings have excellent symptom correlation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The other advantage of ultrasound is that complications of the disease such as extra-nodal lymphomas can often be detected as larger 1–4&nbsp;cm hypoechoic intra-parenchymal masses.

There is also a [[radiology|radiological]] procedure which is a reliable and accurate test for Sjögren's syndrome. A [[contrast agent]] is injected into the [[parotid duct]], which opens from the cheek into the [[Vestibule of mouth|vestibule]] of the mouth opposite the neck of the upper second [[molar tooth]]. Widespread puddling of the injected contrast scattered throughout the gland indicates Sjögren's syndrome.

The Revised Classification Criteria for Sjögren's Syndrome<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vitali C, Bombardieri S, Jonsson R, ''et al.'' |title=Classification criteria for Sjögren's syndrome: a revised version of the European criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group |journal=Ann. Rheum. Dis. |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=554–8 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12006334 |pmc=1754137 |doi=10.1136/ard.61.6.554 |url=}}</ref> requires the presence of signs, symptoms, and lab findings.

Patient-reported symptoms must include both ocular symptoms, such as daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months, and oral symptoms, such as needing to drink water to swallow food.

Objective evidence of eye involvement relies on Schirmer's test and the [[Rose bengal]] score (or similar). [[Histopathology]] studies should show [[focal lymphocytic]] [[sialadenitis]]. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a [[parotid sialography]] or [[salivary scintigraphy]]. [[Autoantibodies]] against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens are also expected.

SS can be excluded from people with past head and neck [[radiation therapy]], [[AIDS|Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), pre-existing [[lymphoma]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[graft-versus-host disease]], and use of [[anticholinergic]] drugs (since a time shorter than four times the life of the drug).

== Pathogenesis ==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
The pathogenesis of Sjögren's Syndrome is not well understood. The number of factors involved in the progression of the disease makes it difficult to determine its exact origin and cause.<ref name="yamamoto">{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto K |title=Pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome |journal=Autoimmun Rev |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=13–8 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12848970 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Sjögren's Syndrome was originally proposed to be a specific, self-perpetuating immune system-mediated loss of [[exocrine glands]], specifically [[acinar]] and [[ductal cells]].<ref name="jonsson">{{cite journal |author=Jonsson R, Vogelsang P, Volchenkov R, Espinosa A, Wahren-Herlenius M, Appel S |title=The complexity of Sjögren's syndrome: novel aspects on pathogenesis |journal=Immunol. Lett. |volume=141 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=21777618 |doi=10.1016/j.imlet.2011.06.007 |url=}}</ref> Although this explains the more obvious symptoms, i.e. the lack of salivary and [[lacrimal fluid]], it does not explain the more widespread systemic effects that are seen in the progression of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tzioufas AG, Kapsogeorgou EK, Moutsopoulos HM |title=Pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome: what we know and what we should learn |journal=J. Autoimmun. |volume=39 |issue=1-2 |pages=4–8 |year=2012 |month=August |pmid=22326205 |doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2012.01.002 |url=}}</ref>
  
The current theory behind the origin of the disease involves a two-hit hypothesis; the first hit is a genetic predisposition to the disease. The second hit occurs upon challenge with a virus. It is suggested that upon presentation of a virus antigen, such as Epsteine-Barr virus ([[Epstein–Barr virus|EBV]]), dysfunctional [[plasmacytoid dendritic cells]] begin to produce elevated levels of [[Interferon α]] (IFN α).<ref name="jonsson" /> This increased level may then incorrectly stimulate auto-antigen [[myeloid]] dendritic cells, which would elicit an immune response resulting in the stimulation of autoreactive [[T cells]] and the proliferation of autoantibody-producing [[B cells]]. This would ultimately result in the destruction of the tissues and glands giving rise to the symptoms associated with Sjögren's Syndrome.  The genetic predisposition may involve the formation of dysfunctional [[plasmacytoid dendritic cells]] that have been theorized to play a role in the pathogenesis of Sjögren's Syndrome.<ref name="jonsson" /> Normally, a cell presenting an antigen incorrectly would be detected, and directed to undergo [[apoptosis]] thus preventing any manifestation of the disease.<ref name="yamamoto" />

== Treatment ==
There is neither a known cure for Sjögren's syndrome nor a specific treatment to permanently restore gland secretion. Instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Moisture replacement therapies such as [[artificial tear]]s may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use goggles to increase local humidity or have [[punctal plug]]s inserted to help retain tears on the ocular surface for a longer time. Additionally, [[cyclosporine]] (Restasis) is available by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as [[cevimeline]] (Evoxac) and [[pilocarpine]]. [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe complications, [[corticosteroid]]s or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, and sometimes [[IVIG]] (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs) such as [[methotrexate]] may be helpful. [[Hydroxychloroquine]] (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than [[methotrexate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dry.org/fox20020816/guide.htm|title=SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME:  A GUIDE FOR THE PATIENT|date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> Salagen, a man-made form of pilocarpine, can be used to help produce tears as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines.

=== Dry eyes ===

'''Punctal plugs'''<ref>Dr. J. Parks, Ancaster ON Canada</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In the advanced stage, despite the use of tear replacement drops, the eyes always feel burning,
scratchy, sore. The sufferer is always aware of some discomfort, the eyes feel worse in the morning and late evening. The use of tear replacement drops becomes tedious and ineffective. At this point it may be appropriate to consider punctal plugs.

Each eye has two sites at the inner corner of each eyelid where tears drain from the eye. The upper eyelid 'puncta' drains approximately 40% of the tears away and the lower puncta drains away the remaining 60% of the tears. If there is a problem with the quantity of tears, as there is in Sjögren's disease, plugging the lower puncta can result in the tears that the patient has remaining on the eye longer.

Punctal plugs can be inserted into the lower or upper tear drainage canals of the eyes. The procedure takes only a few minutes and is painless. It can be done in the optometrist or ophthalmologist's office. Generally, collagen plugs are inserted first. These plugs will dissolve within a few days, so it gives the patient a chance to see if there is any improvement in comfort. Generally, the improvement is immediate. The patient may proceed to use of permanent plugs, although these too can be removed if necessary.

=== Dental care ===

Preventive [[dentistry|dental]] treatment is also necessary (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause [[dental caries]] (cavities). Treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a dental hygienist. Existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth can not be effectively treated through teeth cleaning alone, and are at a high risk of spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or [[root canal]] therapy. This treatment regimen is the same as that used for all xerostomia patients, such as those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy which often damages the salivary glands, as they are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.

Unfortunately, many patients, not realizing the need for dental treatment, do not see a dentist until most of their teeth are beyond the point of restoration. It is not uncommon for a dentist to see a xerostomia patient with severe, untreatable cavities in almost every tooth. In severe cases, the only viable treatment may be to extract all of the patient's teeth and treat with prosthetics such as dentures or implants.

== Prognosis ==
Sjögren's can damage vital organs of the body with symptoms that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases.<ref>National Institute Of Neurological Disorders And Sroke Sjögren's Syndrome Information Page> http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sjogrens/sjogrens.htm</ref>  Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients are able to treat problems symptomatically. Others are forced to cope with blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen [[parotid gland]]s, hoarseness, and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and [[joint pain]] can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to [[proteinuria]], urinary concentrating defect and distal [[renal tubular acidosis]].

Patients with Sjögren's syndrome have a higher rate of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] compared to both patients with other autoimmune diseases and healthy people.<ref name="pmid17992593">{{cite journal |author=Voulgarelis M, Skopouli FN |title=Clinical, immunologic, and molecular factors predicting lymphoma development in Sjogren's syndrome patients |journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=265–74 |year=2007 |pmid=17992593 |doi=10.1007/s12016-007-8001-x}}</ref> About 5% of patients with Sjögren's syndrome will develop some form of lymphoid malignancy.<ref name="pmid18068857">{{cite journal |author=Tzioufas AG, Voulgarelis M |title=Update on Sjögren's syndrome autoimmune epithelitis: from classification to increased neoplasias |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=989–1010 |year=2007 |pmid=18068857 |doi=10.1016/j.berh.2007.09.001}}</ref> Patients with severe cases are much more likely to develop lymphomas than patients with mild or moderate cases.<ref name="pmid17119030"/> The most common lymphomas are salivary extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphomas ([[MALT lymphoma]]s in the salivary glands)<ref name="pmid17992593"/> and [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]].<ref name="pmid17119030">{{cite journal |author=Smedby KE, Baecklund E, Askling J |title=Malignant lymphomas in autoimmunity and inflammation: a review of risks, risk factors, and lymphoma characteristics |journal=Cancer Epidemiol.

People of any age can be affected by Sjögren’s Syndrome, although prevalence is considerably higher among the elderly.<ref name="haugen" /> The mean onset of symptoms has been reported to be 53 years but can range from 46 to 60 years, although experts note that up to half of all cases may be left undiagnosed.<ref name="haugen" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=García-Carrasco M, Ramos-Casals M, Rosas J, ''et al.'' |title=Primary Sjögren syndrome: clinical and immunologic disease patterns in a cohort of 400 patients |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=270–80 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=12169882 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 71-74 year olds are 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with Sjögren’s Syndrome than 40-44 year olds.<ref name="haugen" />

== Research ==
Research on diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome focuses on increasing knowledge and understanding of the disorder, improving diagnostic techniques, and finding ways to treat, prevent, and cure the disorder. The United Kingdom Primary Sjögren's Syndrome Registry, a tissue [[biobank]] of samples taken for research, supported by the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council, UK]] was established in 2010.<ref name="ng">{{cite journal |author=Ng WF, Bowman SJ, Griffiths B |title=United Kingdom Primary Sjogren's Syndrome Registry--a united effort to tackle an orphan rheumatic disease |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=32–9 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=20693261 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keq240 |url=}}</ref>

Viruses that can trigger the immune response of the syndrome include human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ([[HTLV-1]]), [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[hepatitis C virus]] (HCV).<ref name="peri" /> The UK Primary Sjögren's Syndrome Registry supports [[clinical trials]] and genetic studies of Sjögren's syndrome and is open to patients wishing to participate in research studies and researchers studying the disease.<ref name="ng" />

Some research showed that [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin D]] are associated with this disease.<ref name="peri" /> Vitamin D deficiency was found to be related to neurological manifestations and the presence of [[lymphoma]] among patients, while vitamin A levels were inversely associated with extra-glandular manifestations of the disease.<ref name="peri" />

In 2005, an [[animal model]] of Sjögren's syndrome was developed by immunizing mice with [[peptides]] from 60 kDa Ro-antigen.<ref name="scofield">{{cite journal |author=Scofield RH, Asfa S, Obeso D, Jonsson R, Kurien BT |title=Immunization with short peptides from the 60-kDa Ro antigen recapitulates the serological and pathological findings as well as the salivary gland dysfunction of Sjogren's syndrome |journal=J.

== Developments in diagnosis and therapeutics ==
[[Saliva]] is a potential diagnostic tool of Sjögren's syndrome because the salivary component is changed after onset of the disease.<ref name="liu">{{cite journal |author=Liu J, Duan Y |title=Saliva: a potential media for disease diagnostics and monitoring |journal=Oral Oncol. |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=569–77 |year=2012 |month=July |pmid=22349278 |doi=10.1016/j.oraloncology.2012.01.021 |url=}}</ref> With the new [[miniaturization]] technology, called ‘[[lab on a chip]]’, the diagnosis can be more convenient.<ref name="liu" /> 

With regard to therapeutics, multiple [[monoclonal antibodies]] were under investigation in 2007.<ref name="meijer">{{cite journal |author=Meijer JM, Pijpe J, Bootsma H, Vissink A, Kallenberg CG |title=The future of biologic agents in the treatment of Sjögren's syndrome |journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=292–7 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17992596 |pmc=2071970 |doi=10.1007/s12016-007-8005-6 |url=}}</ref> The most promising seemed to be the anti-[[CD20]] [[rituximab]] and the anti-[[CD22]] [[epratuzumab]], while the anti-[[TNF-α]] and [[IFN-α]] seemed less effective.<ref name="meijer" />

In 2008, mucosal administration of [[SPTAN1|α-fodrin]], an autoantigen in Sjögren's syndrome, was shown to inhibit the progression of the disorder in mice effectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=He J, Zhao J, Li Z |title=Mucosal administration of alpha-fodrin inhibits experimental Sjögren's syndrome autoimmunity |journal=Arthritis Res.
