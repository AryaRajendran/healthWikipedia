'''Obstructive lung disease''' is a category of [[respiratory disease]] characterized by [[airway obstruction]].  It is generally characterized by inflamed and easily collapsible airways, obstruction to airflow, problems exhaling and frequent office visits and hospitalizations.  Types of obstructive lung disease include; [[asthma]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[bronchitis]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).  Although COPD shares similar characteristics with all other obstructive lung diseases, such as the signs of [[coughing]] and [[wheezing]], they are distinct conditions in terms of disease onset, frequency of symptoms and reversibility of airway obstruction.<ref>National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of obstructive disease requires several factors depending on the exact disease being diagnosed.  However one commonalty between them is a decreased [[FEV1/FVC ratio]], which is the ability to exhale 70% of their breath within one second.

==Overview table==
Following is an overview of the main obstructive lung diseases. ''Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' is mainly a combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, but may be more or less overlapping with all conditions.<ref name=Kumar13-2/>

==Overview of Obstructive Lung Disease==

===Asthma===
{{main|Asthma}}
Asthma is an obstructive lung disease where the [[bronchial]] tubes (airways) are extra sensitive ([[bronchial hyperresponsiveness|hyperresponsive]]). The airways become inflamed and produce excess mucus and the muscles around the airways tighten making the airways narrower. Asthma is usually triggered by breathing in things in the air such as dust or pollen that produce an allergic reaction. It may be triggered by other things such as an [[upper respiratory tract infection]], cold air, exercise or smoke. Asthma is a common condition and affects over 300 million people around the world.<ref name = "GINA">{{cite web |url= http://www.ginasthma.com|title= GINA – the Global INitiative for Asthma |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref>
Asthma causes recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning.

*'''Exercise-Induced Asthma''' — is common in asthmatics, especially after participation in outdoor activities in cold weather.
*'''Occupational Asthma''' — An estimated 2% to 5% of all asthma episodes may be caused by exposure to a specific sensitizing agent in the workplace.
*'''Nocturnal Asthma''' — is a characteristic problem in poorly controlled asthma and is reported by more than two thirds of sub-optimally treated patients.

A [[peak flow meter]] can record variations in the severity of asthma over time. [[Spirometry]], a measurement of lung function, can provide an assessment of the severity, reversibility, and variability of airflow limitation, and help confirm the diagnosis of asthma.<ref name="GINA"/>

===Bronchiectasis===
{{Main|Bronchiectasis}}
Bronchiectasis refers to the abnormal, irreversible dilatation of the bronchi caused by destructive and inflammatory changes in the airway walls.  Bronchiectasis has three major anatomical patterns: cylindrical bronchiectasis, varicose bronchiectasis and cystic bronchiectasis.

===Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease===
{{main|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}}
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) or chronic airflow limitation (CAL), is a group of illnesses characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The flow of air into and out of the lungs is impaired.<ref name="emedicineCOPD">{{cite web |url= http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic99.htm|title= Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Emphysema|accessdate=2008-04-19 |author= Kleinschmidt, Paul|date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> This can be measured with breathing devices such as a [[peak flow meter]] or by [[spirometry]]. The term COPD includes the conditions [[emphysema]] and [[chronic bronchitis]] although most patients with COPD have characteristics of both conditions to varying degrees. [[Asthma]] being a reversible obstruction of airways is often considered separately, but many COPD patients also have some degree of reversibility in their airways.

In COPD, there is an increase in [[airway resistance]], shown by a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured by [[spirometry]].  COPD is defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) that is less than 0.7.<ref name = "GOLD">{{cite web |url= http://www.goldcopd.com/|title= GOLD – the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease|accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> The residual volume, the volume of air left in the lungs following full expiration, is often increased in COPD, as is the total lung capacity, while the vital capacity remains relatively normal. The increased total lung capacity (hyperinflation) can result in the clinical feature of a  "barrel chest" - a chest with a large front-to-back diameter that occurs in some individuals with COPD. Hyperinflation can also be seen on a [[chest x-ray]] as a flattening of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].

The most common cause of COPD is cigarette [[smoking]]. COPD is a gradually progressive condition and usually only develops after about 20 [[Pack year|pack-year]]s of smoking. COPD may also be caused by breathing in other particles and gases.

The diagnosis of COPD is established through [[spirometry]] although other pulmonary function tests can be helpful.  A [[chest x-ray]] is often ordered to look for hyperinflation and rule out other lung conditions but the lung damage of COPD is not always visible on a [[chest x-ray]]. [[Emphysema]], for example can only be seen on [[computed tomography|CT scan]].

The main form of long term management involves the use of [[Bronchodilator|inhaled bronchodilators]] (specifically [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta agonists]] and [[anticholinergics]]) and inhaled [[Glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]]. Many patients eventually require [[Oxygen therapy|oxygen supplementation]] at home. In severe cases that are difficult to control, chronic treatment with oral [[Glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]] may be necessary, although this is fraught with significant side-effects.

COPD is generally irreversible although lung function can partially recover if the patient stops smoking. Smoking cessation is an essential aspect of treatment.<ref name="BMJbest">{{cite web |url= http://besttreatments.bmj.com/btuk/conditions/14422.html|title= What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?|accessdate=2008-04-19 |date= |work= |publisher= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614083227/http://besttreatments.bmj.com/btuk/conditions/14422.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes involve intensive exercise training combined with education and are effective in improving shortness of breath. Severe [[emphysema]] has been treated with [[lung volume reduction surgery]], with some success in carefully chosen cases. [[Lung transplantation]] is also performed for severe COPD in carefully chosen cases.

[[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] is a fairly rare genetic condition that results in COPD (particularly [[emphysema]]) due to a lack of the antitrypsin protein which protects the fragile alveolar walls from protease enzymes released by [[Inflammation|inflammatory processes]].
