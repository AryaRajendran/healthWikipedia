While in modern Western European culture, such behaviour is considered [[taboo]] and is quite rare, incest between twins is a common feature in [[Indo-European]], [[Indonesia]]n and [[Oceania]]n [[mythology]], and there are a few societies in which the prohibition on it is limited or it is partially accepted{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.
