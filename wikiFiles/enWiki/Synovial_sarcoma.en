A '''synovial sarcoma''' (also known as: '''malignant synovioma'''<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578568/synovioma Synovioma]; Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 20 May, 2012</ref>) is a rare form of [[cancer]] which usually occurs near to the joints of the arm, neck or leg. It is one of the [[soft tissue sarcoma]]s. 

The name "synovial sarcoma" was coined early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to [[synovium]], and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints, indicated a synovial origin; however, the actual cells from which the tumour develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial.<ref name="atlas_2002">{{cite book|editor=Raphael E.

Primary synovial sarcomas are most common in the [[soft tissue]] near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs, including the brain, prostate, and heart. 

Synovial sarcoma occurs most commonly in the young, representing
about 8% of all soft tissue sarcomas<ref name="ferrari_2006">{{cite journal|title=Synovial Sarcoma|author=Ferrari and Collini|journal=ESUN|volume=9|issue=5|year=2012|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/synovial-sarcoma.html?tpm=1_2}}</ref> but about 15-20% of cases in adolescents and young adults.<ref name="Weiss_2001">{{cite journal|author=Weiss SW, Goldblum J|chapter=Malignant soft tissue tumors of uncertain type|editor=Weiss SW, Goldblum JR|title= Enzinger and Weiss's Soft Tissue Tumors|place=St Louis, Missouri|publisher=CV Mosby|pages=1483–1571}}</ref> The peak of incidence is before the 30th birthday and males are affected more often than females (ratio around 1.2:1).<ref name="ferrari_2006"/>

==Histopathology==
Two cell types can be seen microscopically in synovial sarcoma. One fibrous type, known as a spindle or sarcomatous cell, is relatively small and uniform, and found in sheets. The other is epithelial in appearance. Classical synovial sarcoma has a biphasic appearance with both types present. Synovial sarcoma can also appear to be poorly differentiated or to be monophasic fibrous, consisting only of sheets of spindle cells. Some authorities<ref name="atlas_2002"/> state that, extremely rarely, there can be a monophasic epithelial form which causes difficulty in differential diagnosis.

Like other [[soft tissue sarcoma]]s, there is no universal grading system for reporting histopathology results.<ref name="pmid17090186">{{cite journal|author=Coindre JM|title=Grading of soft tissue sarcomas: review and update|journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.|volume=130|issue=10|pages=1448–53|year=2006|pmid=17090186|doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2006)130[1448:GOSTSR]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> In Europe, the Trojani or French system is gaining in popularity<ref>{{cite journal|title=The management of soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities|author=A.

The Trojani system scores the sample, depending on tumour differentiation, [[mitotic index]], and tumour necrosis, between 0 and 6 and then converts this into a grade of between 1 and 3, with 1 representing a less aggressive tumour.<ref name="pmid17090186"/> The NCI system is also a three-grade one, but takes a number of other factors into account.

==Molecular biology==
Most, and perhaps all, cases of synovial sarcoma are associated with a reciprocal [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] t(x;18)(p11.2;q11.2). There is some debate about whether the molecular observation itself is definitional of synovial sarcoma.<ref>

The diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Coindre JM, Pelmus M, Hostein I, Lussan C, Bui BN, Guillou L|title=Should molecular testing be required for diagnosing synovial sarcoma?

The resulting fusion protein brings together the transcriptional activating domain of SS18 and the transcriptional repressor domains of SSX. SS18-SSX is thought to underlie synovial sarcoma pathogenesis through dysregulation of gene expression.<ref name="atlas_2002"/>

There is  some association between the SS18-SSX1 or SS18-SSX2 fusion type and both tumour morphology and five-year survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ladanyi M, Antonescu CR, Leung DH, ''et al.''|title=Impact of SS18-SSX fusion type on the clinical behavior of synovial sarcoma: a multi-institutional retrospective study of 243 patients|journal=Cancer Res.|volume=62|issue=1|pages=135–40 |year=2002|pmid=11782370|doi=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Synovial sarcoma usually presents with an otherwise asymptomatic swelling or mass, although general symptoms related to maligancies can be reported such as fatigue.

==Treatment==
Treatment usually involves:

*[[Surgery]], to remove the tumor and a safety margin of healthy tissue. This is the mainstay of synovial sarcoma treatment and is curative in approximately 20-70% of patients,depending on the particular study being quoted. <ref name="pmid10811674">{{cite journal |author=Lewis JJ, Antonescu CR, Leung DH, ''et al.'' |title=Synovial sarcoma: a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in 112 patients with primary localized tumors of the extremity |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=2087–94 |year=2000 |pmid=10811674 |doi=}}</ref>

*Conventional [[chemotherapy]], (for example, [[doxorubicin hydrochloride]] and [[ifosfamide]]), to reduce the number of remaining microscopic cancer cells. The benefit of chemotherapy in synovial sarcoma to overall survival remains unclear, although a recent study has shown that survival of patients with advanced, poorly differentiated disease marginally improves with doxorubicin/ifosfamide treatment.
*[[Radiotherapy]] to reduce the chance of local recurrence. The benefit of radiotherapy in this disease is less clear than for chemotherapy.
