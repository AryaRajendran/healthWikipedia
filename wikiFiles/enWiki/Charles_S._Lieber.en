{{for|the neuroscientist|Charles M. Lieber}}
'''Charles Saul Lieber''' (February 13, 1931 &ndash; March 1, 2009) was a clinical [[nutritionist]] who established that excess alcohol consumption can cause [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]] even in subjects who have an adequate diet, contradicting then-current scientific opinion.<ref name=NYTObit>{{cite news|title=Charles Lieber, Studied Alcohol as Toxin, Is Dead at 78|first=Lawrence K.|last=Altman|date=March 10, 2009|accessdate=March 11, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/11lieber.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Lieber was born on February 13, 1931, in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], and was forced to flee with his family to [[France]], and later [[Switzerland]], as [[World War II]] loomed. He spent most of the war with a Swiss family that had taken him in from a refugee camp. He attended college in Belgium after the war, where a portion of his stomach was removed due to complications of a [[peptic ulcer]]. At the [[University of Brussels]] school of medicine, his ulcer led him to investigate its causes, prior to his graduation in 1955.<ref name=NYTObit/> 

He continued research there after graduation, until a fellowship took him to [[Boston Medical Center|Boston City Hospital]] and [[Harvard University]]. There he was troubled by the belief in the profession that [[cirrhosis]] in alcoholics was caused by malnutrition and not alcohol itself, having seen alcoholics in Belgium who had liver disease even with a proper diet and based on research by Dr. [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] (co-discoverer of [[insulin]]) that showed that alcohol had no greater an effect in rats than sugar water. Lieber pursued Best's theory that excessive amounts of alcohol damaged the liver.<ref name=NYTObit/>

He was hired by [[Manhattan]]'s [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] in 1963, where he successfully pleaded for a grant from the [[National Institutes of Health]] which would be used for his investigations on alcohol in [[baboon]]s. He was admitted to the faculty of [[Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center]] and was appointed as a professor at the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in 1968, where he identified the biochemical processes used in the human body to metabolize alcohol. In a 1974 study, he showed that baboons who had been given a normal diet combined with the equivalent of about {{convert|750|ml|oz}} of alcohol daily for four years experienced cirrhosis, contradicting medical dogma that inadequate nutrition combined with [[alcoholism]] caused the disease. Other research showed that the effect of even social drinking on the liver can cause it to create toxic substances, increasing the sensitivity of even social drinkers to [[acetaminophen]], [[anesthetics]] and certain solvents<ref name=NYTObit/>

Lieber found that administering antibiotics to alcoholics with liver disease caused by their condition would have less [[ammonia]] converted from [[urea]] in their stomach, which he credited to bacteria in the stomach that he had seen using his microscope and that had been killed by the antibiotic treatment. As the medical wisdom at the time stated that bacteria could not survive in the stomach's acidic environment, his research was largely ignored. It was not until the 1980s, when researchers Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. [[Robin Warren]] identified the bacteria [[Helicobacter pylori]] in the stomach as a cause of ulcers and stomach cancer, for which they won the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name=LATimesObit/>

He pushed the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] to create the journal ''[[Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research]]'' in 1977 as an academic journal for articles regarding alcohol abuse and its treatment, to disseminate research in a field that was minimized by other medical professionals who did not believe that  alcohol research was a legitimate avenue for research and that there was nothing medicine could do to address the problems of alcoholism.<ref name=NYTObit/>

A 1990 study published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' showed that women feel greater effects than men from equivalent amounts of alcohol adjusted for body size due to lower amounts of a stomach enzyme that metabolizes the alcohol and keeps it from entering the bloodstream, though the study did not explain the cause of this enzymatic discrepancy. Lieber indicated that this finding might account for why women who become alcoholics are more likely to experience liver damage.<ref>[[Gina Kolata|Kolata, Gina]].

Other research performed by Lieber showed that [[hepatitis]] could be triggered by consumption of alcohol. He pioneered the therapeutic use of the [[coenzyme]] [[S-Adenosyl methionine]] as a therapeutic means to prevent liver toxicity.<ref name=LATimesObit/>

Lieber died at age 78 on March 1, 2009 of [[stomach cancer]] at his home in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]].<ref name=LATimesObit>Maugh II, Thomas H.

Accessed March 19, 2009.</ref> Lieber was survived by his second wife, Dr. Maria Leo-Lieber, as well as three daughters, two sons and six grandchildren.
