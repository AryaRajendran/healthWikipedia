'''Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers''' are one of two main types of oxygen-carrying [[blood substitute]]s in development, the other one being [[perfluorocarbon]] [[emulsion]]s.  As of 2011 there are no haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers or perfluorocarbon emulsions approved for commercial use in North America or Europe.<ref name=UPT2008>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=transfus/11560&selectedTitle=1~8&source=search_result |title=UpToDate Inc. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Spahn DR, Kocian R |title=Artificial O2 carriers: status in 2005 |journal=Curr.

==Classification==

The development of a “perfect” blood substitute has been going on for many years.<ref name="pmid11834811">{{cite journal |author=Squires JE |title=Artificial blood |journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=295 |issue=5557 |pages=1002–5 |year=2002 |pmid=11834811 |doi=10.1126/science.1068443 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11834811}}</ref> It is hoped that such a product would have certain advantages over human red cells, including rapid and widespread availability, fewer requirements with regard to storage, transport, and compatibility testing, a longer shelf life, and a more consistent supply. An ideal substitute would be less antigenic than allogenic red cells, and would have less risk of disease transmission. 

Two main types of blood substitutes are in development: haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon emulsions.<ref name="pmid10695091">{{cite journal |author=Remy B, Deby-Dupont G, Lamy M |title=Red blood cell substitutes: fluorocarbon emulsions and haemoglobin solutions |journal=[[Br.

==Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers==
===Unmodified cell-free haemoglobin===
The general task of blood within the frame of classic transfusion medicine is oxygen tissue supply (oxygen transport from lung to tissue, oxygen release and picking up carbon dioxide). All of this is accomplished with haemoglobin (Hb), the oxygen carrier protein contained within red cells. According to this simplified postulation, early attempts to develop blood substitutes was focused on simple cell-free solution of haemoglobin.<ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid12702030">{{cite journal |author=Chang TM |title=Future generations of red blood cell substitutes |journal=[[J. Intern. Med.]] |volume=253 |issue=5 |pages=527–35 |year=2003 |pmid=12702030 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01151.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0954-6820&date=2003&volume=253&issue=5&spage=527}}</ref> 

Haemoglobin is a tetramer of two a and two b polypeptide chains, each of which is bound to an iron-containing heme group which each bind one oxygen molecule. This oxygen heme bond results in a conformational change in haemoglobin molecule, which progressively increases the affinity of haemoglobin for additional oxygen molecules. The main consequence is that the small change in oxygen partial pressure results in a large change in the amount of oxygen bound or released by the haemoglobin. This is widely known as [[oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve]]s.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid11390946"/><ref name="pmid10318985">{{cite journal |author=Hébert PC |title=Transfusion requirements in critical care (TRICC): a multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical study.

In contrast, by decreased pH increased of temperature or an increase of 2,3-DPG-concentration curve is shifted to the right allowing the release of oxygen to tissue at higher than normal oxygen partial pressure.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid10318985"/>  According to modern trends this ability today could be termed the „intelligent natural nanotechnique product“. However, it is of great importance that cell free haemoglobin maintains its ability to transport oxygen outside of the RBC. Stroma-free haemoglobin has been investigated as an oxygen carrier since the 1940s, when researchers realized that native haemoglobin is not antigenic. The ability to transport oxygen outside of the RBC and that application of haemoglobin solution did not require compatibility testing and allowed sterilisation promote isolated Hb as a substitute for red cells.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid12559026"/>

Further investigation and evaluation showed that unmodified cell-free haemoglobin had limitations, such as: an oxygen affinity that was too high for effective tissue oxygenation; a half-life within the intravascular space that was too short to be clinically useful; and a tendency to undergo dissociation in dimers with resultant renal tubular damage and toxicity.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid5436128">{{cite journal |author=Rabiner SF, O'Brien K, Peskin GW, Friedman LH |title=Further studies with stroma-free hemoglobin solution |journal=[[Ann. Surg.]] |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=615–22 |year=1970 |pmid=5436128 |doi=10.1097/00000658-197004000-00020 |pmc=1396709}}</ref> Early studies conducted in experimental animals showed that infusion of free haemoglobin caused also substantial increase in oncotic pressure because of its hyperosmolarity, coagulopathy, and hypertension.<ref name="pmid5436128" /> The general problem was that solutions of acellular haemoglobin were not as effective at oxygenation as packed red blood cells because of their high affinity for oxygen. Red blood cells have adapted to release oxygen at an oxygen half-saturation pressure of haemoglobin (P-50) of approximately 26.5&nbsp;mm Hg, as a result of the allosteric effects of red bloods cell 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which shifts the oxyhaemoglobin curve to the right.<ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid11390946"/> Without 2,3-DPG, stroma-free haemoglobin has a P-50 of 12–14&nbsp;mm Hg, not allowing for the adequate release of oxygen to the tissues. This sides effects have been attributed to dissociation of a2b2 tetramer to ab dimers (short intravascular half-life, high oxygen affinity, nephrotoxicity), contamination with RBC stroma and affinity of Hb for nitric oxide (abdominal pain, vasoconstrictive crises).<ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid12686706">{{cite journal |author=Schechter AN, Gladwin MT |title=Hemoglobin and the paracrine and endocrine functions of nitric oxide |journal=[[N.

===Crosslinked haemoglobin===
The molecule haemoglobin can be cross-linked (a covalent bond between 2 globin chains is made through chemical modification), and then polymerised using reagents such as glutaraldehyde. These modifications result in a product that has a higher P50 than that of normal haemoglobin, and an increase in the plasma half-life of up to 30 hours.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid12702030" />

Prevention of rapid breakdown of tetramere into dimere could improve half-life and consecutive also eliminate nephrotoxicity. In a first generation of modified HBOCs specific chemical cross-links are established between haemoglobin polypeptide chain to prevent the dissociation of the Hb tetramer  into dimers. Haemoglobin treatment with 3,5-dibromosalycil fumarate established strong covalent bond between a subunits (aa-cross-linked-Hb) and successfully prevent rapid tetramere dissociation (half-life 12 hours compare to 6 hours of unmodified Hb). Efficiency of cross-linked Hb to transport and unload O2 was confirmed in a variety of shock animal models and there is no doubt that modified Hb solutions improve tissue oxygenation in similar rate as infusion of autologes or allogenes blood.<ref name="pmid11390946"/>

====HemAssist====
In such form stabilized hemoglobin (diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin, DCLHb; trade name HemAssist; Baxter Healthcare Corp) reached Phase III clinical trials. This is the most widely studied of the haemoglobin-based blood substitutes, used in more than a dozen animal and clinical studies.<ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid9083628">{{cite journal |author=Barve A, Sen AP, Saxena PR, Gulati A |title=Dose response effect of diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin (DCLHb) on systemic hemodynamics and regional blood circulation in rats |journal=[[Artif Cells Blood Substit Immobil Biotechnol]] |volume=25 |issue=1-2 |pages=75–84 |year=1997 |pmid=9083628 |doi=10.3109/10731199709118899}}</ref><ref name="pmid10229733">{{cite journal |author=Saxena R, Wijnhoud AD, Carton H, ''et al.'' |title=Controlled safety study of a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, DCLHb, in acute ischemic stroke |journal=[[Stroke]] |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=993–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10229733 |doi= |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10229733}}</ref> It has the advantages of a shelf life of approximately 9 months frozen and 24 hours refrigerated. Its intravascular half-life is limited to 2–12 hours and is dose-dependent. In phase II clinical studies, HemAssist increased perfusion and oxygen consumption in patients with septic shock and in other critically ill patients. This product underwent phase III clinical trials for coronary artery bypass grafting procedures and was determined to decrease the need for transfused packed red blood cells. The adverse effects include hypertension and gastrointestinal distress. 

Observed vasoconstriction as serious side effects manifested as an increase in systemic and pulmonary artery pressure without normalizing cardiac output or restoring intravascular volume. Decreases in the cardiac index may impair optimum oxygen delivery and outweigh the advantage of an oxygen-carrying solution. Severe vasoconstriction complications was reason for terminating this clinical trial.<ref name="pmid12559026"/><ref name="pmid10229733"/> The possible vasoconstriction mechanism involved penetration of modified (but unpolymerised) Hb molecules into interstitial space of the subendothelial layers of vessel walls with consecutive nitric oxide scavenging and a sensitisation of peripheral a-adrenergic receptors. NO produced by endothelial cells affect smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall and modulate the vascular tone toward vasodilatation. Extravased Hb scavenges NO and shift vasomotor tone toward vasoconstriction.<ref name="pmid11390946"/><ref name="pmid12686706" />

===Polymerised haemoglobin===
The problem of vasoconstriction was relative successfully solved with polymerisation (o-raffinose, glutaraldehyde) of the haemoglobin molecule. For example glutaraldehyde target specific amino groups and polymerised haemoglobin (polyhaemoglobin). Polyhaemoglobin (Poly-Hb) composed from 4-5 Hb molecules shows variation in molecular size and configuration, has intrvascular dwell times up to 24 hours and does not penetrate (or reduced penetrate) to subendothelium. Alternative to polymerisation Hb can be conjugated to variety of larger molecules such as dextran, polyoxyethylene or could be genetic modified and residual tetramers are with additional methods removed. Although  these processes are designed to optimise cross-linking with consecutively reduction of  vasoconstrictive HBOCs effects and prolongation of intravascular half-life.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid12702030" />

====Hemolink====
Hemolink (Hemosol, Inc., Mississauga, Canada) is a haemoglobin solution that contains cross-linked an o-rafinose polymerised human haemoglobin which is currently in Phase II trials in cardiothoracic surgery in USA.

====OxyVita====
OxyVita Hb is a polymerised HBOC developed at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] and undergoing [[Clinical trial#Pre-clinical studies|pre-clinical studies]] in the [[United States]]. Polymerisation is via a novel synthetic process involving the linkage of activated [[carboxyl group]]s with [[lysyl]] residues, to form a so-called "zero-linked" polymerised haemoglobin lacking chemical residues. The zero-linked polymerisation process can be applied to a wide variety of [[mammal]]ian haemoglobins, resulting in the formation of a very large superpolymer, with an average [[molecular weight]] of 17[[Dalton (unit)|MDa]]. 

OxyVita Hb has a low [[P50 (pressure)|P50]] and exhibits low [[cooperativity]] (n=1.2). The high molecular weight of OxyVita reduces extravasation from the [[circulatory system]], potentially reducing the possibility of renal failure. An intravascular time greater than 10 hours has been observed in cats. Several preclinical studies in [[cats]] and various other mammals have shown no increase in normal [[blood pressure]] after transfusion with OxyVita Hb.<ref>Bucci, E., Rasynaska, A., Kwansa, H., Matheson-Urbaitis, B., O’Hearne, M., Ulatowski, J.A. and Koehler, R.C.

===Complexes with superoxide dismutase and catalase===

===Recombinant haemoglobin===
Alternatively to modified human or bovine Hb, the continuous development of recombinant techniques opened the possibility to the production of Hb in micro-organisms. So produced Hb is free from mammalian infectious agents and allowed possibility to be designed and constructed with specific conformational and functional characteristics that render them suitable for application in different clinical situations. In contrast to HBOCs solutions in which chemically modified Hb was present in [[heterogeneous]] mixture of different size polymers recombinant Hb represents [[homogeneous]] and stable [[polymer]]. [[Blood transfusion|Transfusion]] experiments performed on mice showed that recombinant Hb maintains physiologically relevant oxygen and heme affinity, stability toward denaturation and [[oxidation]], and effective oxygen delivery as indicated by reduced cerebral ischemic damage.<ref name="pmid12689854">{{cite journal |author=Bobofchak KM, Mito T, Texel SJ, ''et al.'' |title=A recombinant polymeric hemoglobin with conformational, functional, and physiological characteristics of an in vivo O2 transporter |journal=[[Am.

===Encapsulated haemoglobin===
One other form of HBOCs is encapsulated haemoglobin, where the haemoglobin is packed inside an artificial [[neohemocyte]] ("new blood cell"). In the 1950s, the first form of encapsulated haemoglobin was developed but limited technical possibility and absence of public interest slowed further development until the HIV crisis . Liposome-encapsulated haemoglobin (LEH) has been found to be an effective oxygen carrier, without the adverse effects of vasoconstriction.<ref name="pmid12702030" />  The liposome encapsulation appears to increase plasma retention time; however, adverse immune interactions occur with the liposome. Microcapsulation of Hb opens the possibility to constructing  real artificial red cells which contain some enzymes (SOD, CAT, reducing agents, 2,3-DPG) which are involved in reduction of ischemia reperfusion injury and solve problem of  methaemoglobin formation. This product is still in early experimental phase and large-scale production is considered difficult due to costs and technical constraints.<ref name="pmid12702030" /> 

According to different property of HBOCs (or different stages of development), side effects and intention of investors for a prompt commercialisation, some of these products are in different phase of clinical trial and some are still registered for human or animal application.

==Safety==

HBOCs have not been found to be safe in humans.  They increase both the risk of death and risk of [[myocardial infarction]].<ref name="Natanson C, Kern SJ, Lurie P, Banks SM, Wolfe SM 2008 2304–12"/>

== Military Use ==
In the 1980s, an HBOC was developed by the US Army at the [[Letterman Army Hospital|Letterman Army Institute of Research (LAIR)]] which did not need typing. However, in clinical trials the HBOC were proven to be problematic, with more deaths using the HBOC than in the control group. Yet, their use would be of value to sustain the wounded in military conflicts.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} PolyHeme is currently in field trials with the US Army.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Experiments continue<ref name="titleBlood volume and cardiac index in rats after exchange transfusion with hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers -- Migita et al. 82 (6): 1995 -- Journal of Applied Physiology">{{cite web |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/82/6/1995+ |title=Blood volume and cardiac index in rats after exchange transfusion with hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers -- Migita et al. 82 (6): 1995 -- Journal of Applied Physiology |accessdate=2008-02-13 |format= |work=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> with requirements include long shelf-life, no need for refrigeration, and minimal side-effects.<ref name="titleDefenseLink News Article: Oxygen Carriers Coursing Through Clinical Trials">{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/20051110_3316.html |title=DefenseLink News Article: Oxygen Carriers Coursing Through Clinical Trials |accessdate=2008-02-13 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217140851/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/20051110_3316.html |archivedate = December 17, 2007}}</ref>

==History==

The idea to use a blood substitute is old as well as human intention to resuscitate a life with transfusion of real blood. In the past, many but often obscure trials were conducted. One recommendation from Sir Christopher Wren (17th century) who suggested wine and opium as blood substitute .<ref name="pmid11834811"/> At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of modern transfusion medicine initiated through the excellent work of Landsteiner and co-authors opened the possibility to understanding the general principle of blood group serology.<ref>Bendum J:  Geschichte der Bluttransfusion; in Mueller-Eckhardt C (ed): Transfusionsmedizin. Berlin Heidelberg New York, Springer, 1996, pp 3-18.</ref>  Simultaneously, significant progress was made in the fields of heart and circulation physiology as well as in the understanding of the mechanism of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation.<ref name="pmid6296890">{{cite journal |author=Feigl EO |title=Coronary physiology |journal=[[Physiol. Rev.]] |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1–205 |year=1983 |pmid=6296890 |doi= |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6296890}}</ref><ref name="pmid10749843">{{cite journal |author=Lahiri S |title=Historical perspectives of cellular oxygen sensing and responses to hypoxia |journal=[[J.

Complexity of blood compatibility, lack of suitable anticoagulants and insufficient storage methods combined with a disproportion between demand and availability implicated just in early phase of transfusion medicine needs to find one universal blood substitute. The term "blood substitute" is a misnomer. Under the term blood substitute, we understand in first line the substitution of a) facility of red blood cells e.g. haemoglobin as oxygen carriers and b) volume substitution. More accurately the term means "red-cell substitutes" or solutions of “haemoglobin or non-haemoglobin based oxygen carriers”.

Restrictions in applied transfusion medicine especially in disaster situations such as World War Two lay the grounds for an accelerated research in the field of blood substitutes.<ref name="pmid12559026">{{cite journal |author=Reid TJ |title=Hb-based oxygen carriers: are we there yet? |journal=[[Transfusion]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=280–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12559026 |doi= 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00314.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0041-1132&date=2003&volume=43&issue=2&spage=280}}</ref> Early attempts and optimism in developing blood substitutes were very quickly confronted with significant side effects which according to for that time actual level of knowledge and technology could not be promptly eliminated. Appearance of HIV and infection in the 1980s with consecutive public sensibilisation was the impulse necessary to improve blood safety but also renewed impetus for development of infection-safe blood substitutes.<ref name="pmid11834811"/> This situation was more intense with the advent of HCV and Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease which showed the absence of absolutely safe blood.<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid9971869">{{cite journal |author=Goodnough LT, Brecher ME, Kanter MH, AuBuchon JP |title=Transfusion medicine.

Taking into consideration that blood was used as resuscitation fluid with the main goal of improving oxygenation,<ref name="pmid11390946">{{cite journal |author=Spahn DR, Pasch T |title=Physiological properties of blood substitutes |journal=[[News Physiol.

In addition,  an ideal blood substitute was define as one 1.) that required no cross-matching or compatibility testing; 2.) with a long shelf life over a wide range of ambient temperatures; 3.) which exhibit a long intravascular half-life (over days and weeks) 4.) free of side effects and pathogens.

Up until now, two types of oxygen carriers have been established: Perfluorocarbon emulsion and haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOCs).<ref name="pmid11834811"/><ref name="pmid10695091"/><ref name="pmid11390946"/> According to literature a significant increase of published case reports in which HOBC’s were under different conditions applied was observed in the last few years.<ref name="pmid12559026"/>
