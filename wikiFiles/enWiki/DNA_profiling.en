'''DNA profiling''' (also called '''DNA testing''', '''DNA typing''', or '''genetic fingerprinting''') is a technique employed by [[forensic scientist]]s to assist in the identification of individuals  by their respective [[DNA]] profiles. '''DNA profiles''' are encrypted sets of numbers that reflect a person's DNA makeup, which can also be used as the person's identifier. DNA profiling should not be confused with [[full genome sequencing]].<ref>''Kijk'' magazine, 1 January 2009</ref> It is used in, for example, [[parental testing]] and [[criminal investigation]].

==DNA profiling process==

The process begins with a sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a "reference sample"). The most desirable method of collecting a reference sample is the use of a [[buccal swab]], as this reduces the possibility of contamination. When this is not available (e.g. because a court order may be needed and not obtainable) other methods may need to be used to collect a sample of [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[semen]], or other appropriate fluid or tissue from personal items (e.g. toothbrush, razor, etc.) or from stored samples (e.g. banked [[spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[biopsy]] tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives (biological relative) can provide an indication of an individual's profile, as could human remains which had been previously profiled.

A reference sample is then analyzed to create the individual's DNA profile using one of a number of techniques, discussed below. The DNA profile is then compared against another sample to determine whether there is a genetic match.

===RFLP analysis===
{{Main|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}
The first methods for finding out genetics used for DNA profiling involved [[restriction enzyme]] digestion, followed by [[Southern blot]] analysis. Although [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s can exist in the restriction enzyme cleavage sites, more commonly the enzymes and DNA probes were used to analyze VNTR loci. However, the Southern blot technique is laborious, and requires large amounts of undegraded sample DNA. Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many [[minisatellite]] loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but making it hard to discern individual [[allele]]s (and thereby precluding [[parental testing]]). These early techniques have been supplanted by [[PCR]]-based assays.

===PCR analysis===
{{Main|polymerase chain reaction}}
In 1985 (see Mullis and Faloona 1987) a process was reported by which specific portions
of the sample DNA can be amplified almost indefinitely (Saiki et al. 1985, 1988). This has
revolutionized the whole field of DNA study. The process, the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), mimics the biological process of DNA replication, but confines it to specific DNA
sequences of interest.

In this process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual strands. Two
DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA
strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of
each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. In this fashion, two new
copies of the sequence of interest are generated.

Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially
growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. The denaturation is generally performed
by heating, and in this case using, replication enzymes that are tolerant of high
temperatures (Taq DNA polymerase). Instruments that perform thermal cycling are now
readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or
greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.

With the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique, DNA profiling took huge strides forward in both discriminating power and the ability to recover information from very small (or degraded) starting samples. PCR greatly amplifies the amounts of a specific region of DNA, using [[oligonucleotide]] [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] and a [[Taq polymerase|thermostable DNA polymerase]]. Early assays such as the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-[[HLA-DQA1|DQ alpha]] [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|reverse]] [[dot blot]] strips grew to be very popular due to their ease of use, and the speed with which a result could be obtained. However they were not as discriminating as [[RFLP]]. It was also difficult to determine a DNA profile for mixed samples, such as a [[vaginal swab]] from a [[sexual assault]] victim.

Fortunately, the PCR method was readily adaptable for analyzing [[VNTR]], particularly [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] loci.DNA profiling (also called DNA testing, DNA typing, or genetic fingerprinting) is a technique employed by forensic scientists to assist in the identification of individuals by their respective DNA profiles. DNA profiles are encrypted sets of numbers that reflect a person's DNA makeup, which can also be used as the person's identifier. DNA profiling should not be confused with full genome sequencing.[1] It is used in, for example, parental testing and criminal investigation.
 
Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are monozygotic twins.[2] DNA profiling uses repetitive ("repeat") sequences that are highly variable,[2] called variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), particularly short tandem repeats (STRs). VNTR loci are very similar between closely related humans, but so variable that unrelated individuals are extremely unlikely to have the same VNTRs.

s. Interlaboratory studies have demonstrated the importance of human DNA quantitation on achieving reliable interpretation of STR typing and obtaining consistent results across laboratories.

===STR analysis===
{{Main|Short tandem repeats}}
The method of DNA profiling used today is based on PCR and uses short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using [[PCR]]. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using [[electrophoresis]]. There are two common methods of separation and detection, [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) and [[gel electrophoresis]].

Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of alleles is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals. The power of STR analysis comes from looking at multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.

From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems which amplify the [[CODIS]] 13 core loci are almost universal, while in the UK the [[SGM+]] 11 loci system (which is compatible with The [[National DNA Database]]), is in use. Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on multiplex reactions, whereby many STR regions will be tested at the same time.

The true power of [[STR analysis]] is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 13 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are [[independent assortment|independently assorted]] (having a certain number of repeats at one locus doesn't change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the [[Bayes' theorem#Bayes' theorem derived via conditional probabilities|product rule for probabilities]] can be applied. This means that if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x10<sup>18</sup>) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.<ref>{{Cite news |last = Felch|first = Jason|coauthors = et al|title = FBI resists scrutiny of 'matches'|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|pages = P8|date = July 20, 2008|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/20/local/me-dna20|accessdate =<!--March 18,2010-->}}</ref> Moreover, since there are about 12 million [[monozygotic twins]] on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.

In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a distant relative, such as a sample being contaminated from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. Logically, the risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested, to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person wasn't actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.

===AmpFLP===
{{Main|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}

Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified fragment length polymorphism was also put into practice during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used [[PCR]] to amplify DNA samples. It relied on [[variable number tandem repeat]] (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by [[silver staining]] the gel. One popular locus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together at the top of the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of [[phylogenetic]] trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.

===DNA family relationship analysis===
Using [[PCR]] technology, DNA analysis is widely applied to determine genetic family relationships such as paternity, maternity, siblingship and other kinships.

During conception, the father’s sperm cell and the mother’s egg cell, each containing half the amount of DNA found in other body cells, meet and fuse to form a fertilized egg, called a zygote. The zygote contains a complete set of DNA molecules, a unique combination of DNA from both parents. This zygote divides and multiplies into an embryo and later, a full human being.

At each stage of development, all the cells forming the body contain the same DNA—half from the father and half from the mother. This fact allows the relationship testing to use all types of all samples including loose cells from the cheeks collected using buccal swabs, blood or other types of samples.

While a lot of DNA contains information for a certain function, there is some called junk DNA, which is currently used for human identification. At some special locations (called loci) in the junk DNA, predictable inheritance patterns were found to be useful in determining biological relationships. These locations contain specific DNA markers that DNA scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, the markers used are [[Short Tandem Repeats]] (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.

Each person’s DNA contains two copies of these markers—one copy inherited from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, the markers at each person’s DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence, depending on the markers inherited from the parents.

The combination of marker sizes found in each person makes up his/her unique genetic profile. When determining the relationship between two individuals, their genetic profiles are compared to see if they share the same inheritance patterns at a statistically conclusive rate.

For example, the following sample report from this commercial DNA paternity testing laboratory Universal Genetics signifies how relatedness between parents and child is identified on those special markers:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! DNA Marker
! Mother
! Child
! Alleged father
|-
| D21S11
| 28, 30
| 28, 31
| 29, 31
|-
| D7S820
| 9, 10
| 10, 11
| 11, 12
|-
| TH01
| 14, 15
| 14, 16
| 15, 16
|-
| D13S317
| 7, 8
| 7, 9
| 8, 9
|-
| D19S433
| 14, 16.2
| 14, 15
| 15, 17
|}

The partial results indicate that the child and the alleged father’s DNA match among these five markers. The complete test results show this correlation on 16 markers between the child and the tested man to draw a conclusion of whether or not the man is the biological father.

Scientifically, each marker is assigned with a Paternity Index (PI), which is a statistical measure of how powerfully a match at a particular marker indicates paternity. The PI of each marker is multiplied with each other to generate the Combined Paternity Index (CPI), which indicates the overall probability of an individual being the biological father of the tested child relative to any random man from the entire population of the same race. The CPI is then converted into a Probability of Paternity showing the degree of relatedness between the alleged father and child.

The DNA test report in other family relationship tests, such as grandparentage and siblingship tests, is similar to a paternity test report. Instead of the Combined Paternity Index, a different value, such as a Siblingship Index, is reported.

The report shows the genetic profiles of each tested person. If there are markers shared among the tested individuals, the probability of biological relationship is calculated to determine how likely the tested individuals share the same markers due to a blood relationship.

===Y-chromosome analysis===
Recent innovations have included the creation of primers targeting polymorphic regions on the Y-chromosome ([[Y-STR]]), which allows resolution of a mixed DNA sample from a male and female and/or cases in which a [[differential extraction]] is not possible. Y-chromosomes are paternally inherited, so Y-STR analysis can help in the identification of paternally related males. Y-STR analysis was performed in the [[Sally Hemings]] controversy to determine if [[Thomas Jefferson]] had sired a son with one of his slaves.
The analysis of the Y-chromosome yields weaker results than autosomal chromosome analysis. The Y male sex-determining chromosome, as it is only inherited by males from their fathers, is almost identical along the patrilineal line. This leads to a less precise analysis than if autosomal chromosomes were testing, because of the random matching that occurs between pairs of chromosomes as zygotes are being made. <ref> [http://www.nij.gov/journals/267/extending-str.htm] "STR Analysis" </ref>

===Mitochondrial analysis===
{{Main|Mitochondrial DNA}}

For highly degraded samples, it is sometimes impossible to get a complete profile of the 13 CODIS STRs. In these situations, [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is sometimes typed due to there being many copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there may only be 1-2 copies of the nuclear DNA. Forensic scientists amplify the HV1 and HV2 regions of the mtDNA, then sequence each region and compare single-nucleotide differences to a reference. Because mtDNA is maternally inherited, directly linked maternal relatives can be used as match references, such as one's maternal grandmother's daughter's son. A difference of two or more nucleotides is generally considered to be an exclusion. [[Heteroplasmy]] and poly-C differences may throw off straight sequence comparisons, so some expertise on the part of the analyst is required. mtDNA is useful in determining clear identities, such as those of missing people when a maternally linked relative can be found. mtDNA testing was used in determining that [[Anna Anderson]] was not the Russian princess she had claimed to be, [[Anastasia Romanov]].

mtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth.

==DNA databases==
{{Main|National DNA database}}
There are now several [[DNA database]]s in existence around the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government controlled. The [[United States]] maintains the largest [[DNA database]], with the [[Combined DNA Index System]], holding over 5 million records as of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/national.htm |title=CODIS&nbsp;— National DNA Index System |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] maintains the [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|National DNA Database]] (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, is giving concern to [[civil liberties]] groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples |title=Restrictions on use and destruction of fingerprints and samples |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

The [[USA PATRIOT Act|U.S. Patriot Act]] of the United States provides a means for the U.S. government to get DNA samples from other countries if they{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} <!--who? employees? you can't get a DNA sample for a division or a head office-->are either a division of, or head office of, a company operating in the U.S. Under the act, the American offices of the company can't divulge to their subsidiaries/offices in other countries the reasons that these DNA samples are sought or by whom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

When a match is made from a National DNA Databank to link a crime scene to an offender who has provided a DNA Sample to a databank that link is often referred to as a ''cold hit''. A cold hit is of value in referring the police agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made from outside the DNA Databank.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DNA&nbsp;— A Practical Guide|authors=Rose & Goos|publisher=Carswell Publications|location=Toronto}}</ref>

FBI agents cannot legally store DNA of a person who was not convicted of a crime. DNA collected from a suspect who was not later convicted must be disposed of and not entered into the database. In 1998 a man residing in the UK was arrested on accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later released. Nine months later, this man’s DNA was accidentally and illegally entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found at cold cases, and in this case, this man was found to be a match to DNA found at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database. The request was facilitated. <ref name=autogenerated1> [http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/double-helix-jeopardy] "Double Helix Jeopardy" </ref>

==Considerations when evaluating DNA evidence==
In the early days of the use of genetic fingerprinting as criminal evidence, juries were often swayed by spurious statistical arguments by defense lawyers along these lines: given a match that had a 1 in 5 million probability of occurring by chance, the lawyer would argue that this meant that in a country of say 60 million people there were 12 people who would also match the profile. This was then translated to a 1 in 12 chance of the suspect being the guilty one. This argument is not sound unless the suspect was drawn at random from the population of the country. In fact, a jury should consider how likely it is that an individual matching the genetic profile would also have been a suspect in the case for other reasons. Another spurious statistical argument is based on the false assumption that a 1 in 5 million probability of a match automatically translates into a 1 in 5 million probability of innocence and is known as the [[prosecutor's fallacy]].

When using [[RFLP]], the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because [[monozygotic twins]] are 0.2% of the human population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures do not reflect the theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in ''precisely'' the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates which may be cause for concern.<ref>Nick Paton Walsh [http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,640157,00.html False result fear over DNA tests] [[The Observer]], Sunday 27 January 2002.</ref> In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309053951/html/35.html The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence] 1996.</ref> Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.

Since 1998, the DNA profiling system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the [[SGM+]] DNA profiling system which includes 10 STR regions and a sex indicating test. [[Short tandem repeat|STRs]] do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar power of discrimination (1 in 10<sup>13</sup> for unrelated individuals if using a full [[SGM+]] profile). It should be noted that figures of this magnitude are not considered to be statistically supportable by scientists in the UK, for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, [[chimerism]] is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.

===Evidence of genetic relationship===
It's also possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship, although such evidence varies in strength from weak to positive. Testing that shows no relationship is absolutely certain.

While almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, ultra-rare individuals, known as "[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]", have at least two different sets of genes. There have been two cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated to her children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693 |title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> This happens when two eggs are fertilized at the same time and fuse together to create one individual instead of twins.

==Fake DNA evidence==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The value of DNA evidence has to be seen in light of recent cases where criminals planted fake DNA samples at crime scenes. In one case, a criminal even planted fake DNA evidence in his own body: Dr. [[John Schneeberger]] raped one of his sedated patients in 1992 and left semen on her underwear. Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and compared its DNA against the crime scene semen DNA on three occasions, never showing a match. It turned out that he had surgically inserted a [[Penrose drain]] into his arm and filled it with foreign blood and [[anticoagulant]]s.

The functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences (open reading frames [ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought.<ref>{{cite journal|last=James L. Hartley, Gary F. Temple, and Michael A. Brasch|title=DNA Cloning Using In Vitro Site-Specific Recombination|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|year=2000}}</ref> In a study  conducted by the life science company Nucleix and published in the journal Forensic Science International, scientists found that an [[In vitro]] synthesized sample of DNA matching any desired genetic profile can be constructed using standard [[molecular biology]] techniques without obtaining any actual tissue from that person.

In the case of the [[Phantom of Heilbronn]], police detectives found DNA traces from the same woman on various crime scenes in Austria, Germany and France&nbsp;— among them murders, burglaries and robberies. Only after the DNA of the "woman" matched the DNA sampled from the burned body of a ''male'' asylum seeker in France, detectives began to have serious doubts about the DNA evidence. In that case, DNA traces were already present on the [[cotton swab]]s used to collect the samples at the crime scene, and the swabs had all been produced at the same factory in Austria. The company's product specification said that the swabs were guaranteed to be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]], but not DNA-free.

===Familial DNA searching===
Familial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as “Familial DNA” or “Familial DNA Database Searching”) is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match.<ref>Diamond, Diane. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-dimond/searching-the-family-dna-_b_845340.html "Searching the Family DNA Tree to Solve Crime."] The Huffington Post accessed April 17, 2011.</ref><ref>Bieber, Frederick et al.,(2006)[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/312/5778/1315.short “Finding Criminals Through DNA of Their Relatives”] Science. 312 Sci. 1315, 1315–16.</ref> After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state’s DNA database in order to generate a list of those offenders most likely to be a close relative of the forensic profile.<ref>[http://www.dnaforensics.com/FamilialSearches.aspx#uk “Science of the Future: Identifying Criminals Through Their Family Members”].</ref> To eliminate the majority of this list, crime lab technicians conduct [[Y-STR]] analysis that confirms the familial relationships suggested by the first list. Using standard investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The family tree is populated from information gathered from [[public records]] and criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members’ involvement in the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads from the case, such as [[witness]] or victim statements, to identify a suspect. Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the sample found at the crime scene, in accordance with well established and constitutionally accepted practices, to definitively identify the suspect as the source of the crime scene DNA.

Familial DNA database searching was first used to convict Craig Harman of manslaughter in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2004.<ref>Bhattacharya, Shaoni [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4908-killer-convicted-thanks-to-relatives-dna.html “Killer Convicted Thanks to Relative's DNA.”] New Scientist accessed April 17, 2011.</ref> Craig Harman was convicted using familial DNA because of the partial matches from Harman's brother. When the police questioned Harman's brother, the police noticed Harman lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman confessed when his DNA isolated from the DNA found on the brick, matched. <ref> [http://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/event/264460/media/slspublic/Greely.pdf "Family Ties: the Use of DNA Databases to Catch Offenders' Kin"]. </ref>Currently, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States.

Critics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique may be an invasion of an individual’s [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]] rights.<ref>Murphy, Erin Elizabeth, (2009). [http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/3/murphy.pdf “Relative Doubt: Familial Searches of DNA Databases”] Michigan Law Review, Vol. 109, 291-348, 2010.</ref> Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, while others are arguing that the only fair way to construct of database is to make it universal. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are no more threatening than other police search techniques.<ref>Suter, Sonia. [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v23.2/23HarvJLTech309.pdf “ All in The Family: Privacy and DNA Familial Searching”] (2010). Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, Vol. 23,328, 2010.</ref> The [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in United States v. Pool ruled that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator.<ref>[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/14/09-10303.pdf “US v. Pool”] Pool 621F .3d 1213.</ref> Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect’s DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.
Critics also claim that racial profiling could occur on account of Familial DNA testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are much higher than that of the overall population. It is unclear whether this is due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which are found in some parts of the United States, lead to an even greater level of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much heavier on police discretion, inevitably leading to a bias on the amount of people belonging to a certain race that are being convicted. <ref name=autogenerated1 />

For instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney’s Office successfully identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect’s blood left at the scene of the crime strongly resembled that of a current [[Colorado Department of Corrections]] prisoner.<ref>Pankratz, Howard.[http://www.denverpost.com/denver/ci_13801125 "Denver Uses ‘Familial DNA Evidence’ to Solve Car Break-Ins."] The Denver Post accessed April 17, 2011.</ref> Using publicly available records, the investigators created a family tree. They then eliminated all the family members who were incarcerated at the time of the offense, as well as all of the females (the crime scene DNA profile was that of a male). Investigators obtained a court order to collect the suspect’s DNA, but the suspect actually volunteered to come to a police station and give a DNA sample. After providing the sample, the suspect walked free without further interrogation or detainment. Later confronted with an exact match to the forensic profile, the suspect pled guilty to criminal trespass at the first court date and was sentenced to two years probation.

===Partial matches===
Partial DNA matches are not searches themselves, but are the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one [[allele]] at every [[locus (genetics)|locus]].<ref>[http://www.chromosomal-labs.com/files/FindingCriminals.pdf "Finding Criminals Through DNA Testing of Their Relatives"] Technical Bulletin, Chromosomal Laboratories, Inc. accessed April 22, 2011.</ref> Partial matching does not involve the use of a familial search software, such as those used in the UK and Denver, or additional [[Y-STR]] analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and US<ref>[http://www.denverda.org/DNA/Familial_DNA_Database_Searches.htm “Denver District Attorney DNA Resources”] accessed April 20, 2011.</ref> and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. [[Darryl Hunt]] was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina.<ref>[http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/Blog-Search.php?check=true&tag=134 “Darryl Hunt, The Innocence Project”].</ref> Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.

===Surreptitious DNA collecting===
Police forces may collect DNA samples without the suspects' knowledge, and use it as evidence. Legality of this mode of proceeding has been questioned in [[Australia]].

In the United States, it has been accepted, courts often claiming that there was no [[expectation of privacy]], citing [[California v. Greenwood]] (1985), during which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] does not prohibit the [[Search warrant|warrantless]] search and seizure of [[Waste|garbage]] left for collection outside the [[curtilage]] of a [[home]]. Critics of this practice underline the fact that this analogy ignores that "most people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one’s DNA in public."<ref>[[Amy Harmon]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/science/03dna.html Lawyers Fight DNA Samples Gained on Sly], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 3, 2008.</ref>

In the [[UK]], the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] prohibited private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA analysis, but excluded medical and criminal investigations from the offence.<ref>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Scientificdevelopmentgeneticsandbioethics/Tissue/TissueGeneralInformation/DH_4102169 Human Tissue Act 2004], UK, available in pdf.</ref>

The Defendant is one of them. If that is the position, the decision you have to reach, on all the evidence, is whether you are sure that it was the Defendant who left that stain or whether it is possible that it was one of that other small group of men who share the same DNA characteristics.</blockquote>

:“We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a "missing" allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence exists which would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |title=WikiCrimeLine DNA profiling |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

===Development of artificial DNA===

In August 2009, scientists in Israel raised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal ''Forensic Science International: Genetics'', the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.<ref name="pollack">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18dna.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=DNA Evidence Can Be Fabricated, Scientists Show|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>

The researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.<ref name="pollack"/>

''The New York Times'' quoted the lead author on the paper, Dr. Daniel Frumkin, saying, "You can just engineer a crime scene... any biology undergraduate could perform this."<ref name="pollack"/>

Dr. Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications, in particular, [[DNA methylation]]. Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains methyl group modifications within a CpG dinucleotide context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this epigenetic modification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from original, genuine, DNA.<ref name="pollack"/>

It is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.<ref name="frumkin">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(09)00099-4/abstract |title=Elsevier |publisher=Fsigenetics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912 was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.<ref>"[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-05-05-1914-dna_x.htm DNA clears man of 1914 kidnapping conviction]", ''[[USA Today]]'', (May 5, 2004), by Allen G.

*In 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the [[University of Michigan]], after DNA found on Mixer's [[pantyhose]] was matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never successfully connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/22/48hours/main1066064.shtml CBS News] story on the Jane Mixer murder case; March 24, 2007.</ref><ref>Another [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/earlyshow/main3065082.shtml CBS News] story on the Mixer case; July 17, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.garyisinnocent.org An advocacy site] challenging Leiterman's conviction in the Mixer murder.</ref>
*In December 2005, Evan Simmons was proven innocent of a 1981 attack on an Atlanta woman after serving twenty-four years in prison. Mr. Clark is the 164th person in the United States and the fifth in Georgia to be freed using post-conviction DNA testing.
*In March 2009, [[Sean Hodgson]] who spent 27 years in jail, convicted of killing Teresa De Simone, 22, in her car in [[Southampton]] 30 years ago was released by senior judges. Tests prove DNA from the scene was not his. British police have now reopened the case.
