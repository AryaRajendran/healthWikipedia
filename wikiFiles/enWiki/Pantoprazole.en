'''Pantoprazole''' (sold under various brand names including '''Somac''', '''Tecta''', '''Pantoloc''', '''Controloc''', '''Protium''', '''Protonix''', '''Pantecta''', '''Pantoheal''', '''Pantpas''', '''Ppi-40''', and '''Neoppi''') is a [[proton pump inhibitor]] drug that inhibits [[gastric acid]] secretion.

==Use==
Pantoprazole is used for short-term treatment of erosion and ulceration of the esophagus caused by [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]. Initial treatment is generally of eight weeks' duration, after which another eight week course of treatment may be considered if necessary.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} It can be used as a maintenance therapy for long term use after initial response is obtained. 

This medication may affect the results of certain lab tests, such as drug screenings (pantoprazole can cause a false positive for [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], the psychoactive component of [[cannabis]]<ref>Protonix package insert 12/07</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/192876-what-causes-false-positives-in-marijuana-drug-testing/ | title = What causes false positives in marijuana drug testing? | publisher = LiveStrong}}</ref>).

==Adverse effects==
Antacid preparations such as pantoprazole work by suppressing the acid-mediated breakdown of proteins. This leads to an elevated risk of developing food and drug allergies due to undigested proteins passing into the gastrointestinal tract where sensitisation occurs. It is unclear whether this risk occurs with short-term or only long-term use.<ref name="pmid21121928">{{cite journal |author=Pali-Schöll I, Jensen-Jarolim E |title=Anti-acid medication as a risk factor for food allergy |journal=Allergy |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=469–77 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21121928 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02511.x |url=}}</ref>

===Common===
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (3%), diarrhea (4%), flatulence (4%)
* Neurologic: Headache (5%)

===Serious===
* Gastrointestinal: [[Atrophic gastritis]], [[clostridium difficile]] diarrhea
* Hematologic: [[Thrombocytopenia]] (less than 1%)
* Immunologic: [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]]
* Musculoskeletal: Muscle disorders, bone fracture, osteoporosis-related, hip fracture, [[rhabdomyolysis]]
* Renal: [[Interstitial nephritis]] (rare)

==Pharmacology==
Pantoprazole is metabolized in the liver by the [[cytochrome P450]] system.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00042737-199610001-00005 | author = Meyer, U A  | title = Metabolic interactions of the proton-pump inhibitors lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole with other drugs | journal = European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology  | year = 1996 | volume = 8 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S21–25}}</ref> Metabolism mainly consists of [[demethylation]] by [[CYP2C19]] followed by [[sulfation]]. Another metabolic pathway is oxidation by [[CYP3A4]]. Pantoprazole metabolites are not thought to have any pharmacological significance. Pantoprazole is relatively free of drug interactions;<ref>{{cite journal | author = Steinijans, V. W.; Huber, R.; Hartmann, M.; Zech, K.; Bliesath, H.; Wurst, W.; Radtke, H. W.  | title = Lack of pantoprazole drug interactions in man: An updated review | journal = International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics  | year = 1996 | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 243–262 | pmid = 8793611}}</ref> however, it may alter the absorption of other medications that depend on the amount of acid in the stomach, such as [[ketoconazole]] or [[digoxin]]. Generally inactive at acidic pH of stomach, thus it is usually given with a pro kinetic drug. Pantoprazole binds irreversibly to H+K+ATPase (proton pumps) and suppresses the secretion of acid. As it binds irreversibly to the pumps, new pumps have to be made before acid production can be resumed. The drug's plasma half-life is about 2 hours.<ref name = Sachs2010>{{cite journal |author=Sachs G, Shin JM, Hunt R |title=Novel approaches to inhibition of gastric acid secretion |journal=Curr Gastroenterol Rep |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=437–47 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=20924727 |pmc=2974194 |doi=10.1007/s11894-010-0149-5 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2974194}}</ref>
