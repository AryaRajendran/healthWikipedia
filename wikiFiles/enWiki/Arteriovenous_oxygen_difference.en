The '''arteriovenous oxygen difference''', or '''a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff''', is the difference in the [[oxygen]] content of the [[blood]] between the [[arterial blood]] and the [[venous blood]]. It is an indication of how much oxygen is removed from the blood in [[Capillary|capillaries]] as the blood [[Circulatory system|circulates]] in the body. The a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff and [[cardiac output]] are the main factors that allow variation in the body's total oxygen consumption, and are important in measuring [[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub>]]. The a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff is usually measured in [[Litre#SI_prefixes_applied_to_the_litre|millilitres]] of oxygen per 100 millilitres of blood (mL/100 mL).<ref name=avo2diff-jrank>{{cite web|title=Arteriovenous oxygen difference|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/5973/arteriovenous-oxygen-difference.html|work=Sports Medicine, Sports Science and Kinesiology |publisher=Net Industries and its Licensors|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=2011}}</ref><ref name=pe-cla1>Malpeli, ''Physical Education'', Chapter 4: Acute Responses to Exercise, p. 106.</ref>

==Measurement==
The arteriovenous oxygen difference is usually taken by comparing the difference in the oxygen concentration of [[Blood#Oxygen_transport|oxygenated blood]] in the [[Femoral artery|femoral]], [[Brachial artery|brachial]], or [[radial artery]] and the oxygen concentration in the [[Blood#Oxygen_transport|deoxygenated blood]] from the mixed supply found in the [[pulmonary artery]] (as an indicator of the typical mixed venous supply).<ref name=avo2diff-jrank /> 

Put in simple terms:
:''a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff = C<sub>a</sub> – C<sub>v</sub>''
::where:
::*''C<sub>a</sub>'' = the oxygen concentration of arterial blood (oxygenated blood)
::*''C<sub>v</sub>'' = the oxygen concentration of venous blood (deoxygenated blood)

The usual unit for a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff is millilitres of oxygen per 100 millilitres of blood (mL/100 mL),<ref name=avo2diff-jrank /><ref name=pe-cla1 /> however, particularly in medical uses, other units may be used, such as [[Micro-|micro]][[Mole (unit)|moles]] per millilitre (μmol/mL).<ref name=jns-cerebral>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Claudia S.|coauthors=et al|title=Cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference as an estimate of cerebral blood flow in comatose patients|journal=[[Journal of Neurosurgery]]|year=1989|month=February|volume= 70|issue= 2|url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/jns.1989.70.2.0222?journalCode=jns|accessdate=30 April 2011|publisher=American Association of Neurosurgeons|doi=10.3171/jns.1989.70.2.0222}}</ref>

In practice, a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff may be determined using the [[Fick Principle]] rather than by taking direct blood samples. In order to do so oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) may be measured using a [[spirometer]] to detect gaseous concentrations in exhaled air compared to inhaled air, while [[cardiac output]] can be determined using a [[Medical_ultrasonography#Doppler_sonography|Doppler ultrasound]].<ref name=jp-exerciselevel>{{cite journal|last=De Cort|first=S. C|coauthors=et al|title=Cardiac output, oxygen consumption and arteriovenous oxygen difference following a sudden rise in exercise level in humans|journal=[[The Journal of Physiology]]|year=1991|month=September|volume= 441|pages=501–512|accessdate=30 April 2011|publisher=[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]|pmc=1180211|pmid=1816384}}</ref>   

Arterial blood will generally contain an oxygen concentration of around 20 mL/100 mL.<ref name=pe-cla1 /> Venous blood with an oxygen concentration of 15 mL/100 mL would therefore lead to typical values of the a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff at rest of around 5 mL/100 mL. During intense exercise, however, the a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff can increase to as much as 16 mL/100 mL due to the working [[Skeletal muscle|muscles]] extracting far more oxygen from the blood than they do at rest.<ref name=avo2diff-jrank />

Alternatively, in order to find the efficiency of the [[lungs]] in replenishing blood oxygen levels, the a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff may instead be taken by comparing blood from the pulmonary artery and the [[pulmonary vein]]; in this case a negative value for a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff would be obtained as the oxygen content of the blood would have increased.

==Impacts of exercise==
[[Physical exercise]] leads to an increase in the arteriovenous oxygen difference in all individuals. As exercise intensities increase, the muscles increase the amount of oxygen they extract from the blood and this therefore results in further increases in a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff.<ref name=pe-cla2>Malpeli, ''Physical Education'', Chapter 11: Chronic Training Adaptations, p. 304.</ref> 

The maximum a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff is also usually greater in [[Training#Physical_training|trained]] [[sportsperson|athlete]]s than in untrained individuals.<ref name=avo2diff-jrank /> This is a result of [[aerobic exercise]] leading to [[hypertrophy]] of the [[Skeletal_muscle#Muscle_fibers|slow twitch muscle fibres]] mainly due to increased capillarisation. The increase in capillary beds in the muscle means that blood supply to that muscle can be greater and [[diffusion]] of oxygen, [[carbon dioxide]], and other [[metabolite]]s increases.<ref name=pe-cla3>Malpeli, ''Physical Education'', Chapter 11: Chronic Training Adaptations, p. 307.</ref> With training the muscles also improve in their ability to extract oxygen from the blood and process the oxygen,<ref name=pe-cla3 /> possibly due to adaptations of the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and an increase in the muscle's [[myoglobin]] content.<ref name=avo2diff-jrank />

Research has shown that following the commencement of exercise there is a delay in the increase of the a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff, and that a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff only has a marginal impact in the total change in VO<sub>2</sub> in the early stages of exercise. The bulk of the early increase in oxygen consumption after a sudden change in exercise levels results from increased cardiac output.<ref name=jp-exerciselevel /> However it has also been found that the increase in the maximal a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff resulting from adaptations to a physical training program can account for most of the difference in [[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub> max]] in subjects participating in sub-maximal exercise.<ref name=circ-chd>{{cite journal|last=Detry|first=Jean-Marie R.|coauthors=et al|title=Increased Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference After Physical Training in Coronary Heart Disease|journal=[[Circulation (journal){{!}}Circulation]]|year=1971|volume= 44|pages=109–118|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/1/109|accessdate=30 April 2011|publisher=[[American Heart Association]]|issue=1}}</ref>

==In medicine==
Arteriovenous oxygen difference is also used in other areas of study such as [[medicine]] and [[medical research]]. For example the a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff has been used to measure [[cerebral blood flow]] in [[coma]]tose patients, assisting with their [[diagnosis]] and [[therapy|treatment]].<ref name=jns-cerebral /> The a-vO<sub>2</sub> diff has also been used to determine the effects of physical training in [[Coronary disease|coronary patients]].<ref name=circ-chd />
