A '''splenectomy''' is a [[Surgery|surgical procedure]] that partially or completely removes the [[spleen]].

==Indications==
The spleen, similar in structure to a large [[lymph node]], acts as a blood filter. Current knowledge of its purpose includes the removal of old [[red blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s, and the detection and fight against certain bacteria. It is also known to function as a site for the development of new red blood cells from their hematopoietic stem cell precursors, and particularly in situations in which the [[bone marrow]], the normal site for this process, has been compromised by a disorder such as [[leukemia]]. The spleen is enlarged in a variety of conditions such as [[malaria]], [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] and most commonly in cancers of the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic]]s, such as [[lymphoma]]s or [[leukemia]].

It is removed under the following circumstances:
#When it becomes very large such that it becomes destructive to [[platelet]]s/red blood cells
#For diagnosing certain [[lymphoma]]s
#Certain cases of [[wandering spleen]]
#When platelets are destroyed in the spleen as a result of an [[auto-immune]] condition, such as [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]].
#When the spleen bleeds following [[physical trauma]]
#Following spontaneous [[Ruptured spleen|rupture]]
#For long-term treatment of congenital erythropoietic [[porphyria]] (CEP) if severe [[hemolytic anemia]] develops<!--

The classical cause of traumatic damage to the spleen is a blow to the abdomen during a sporting event. In cases where the spleen is enlarged due to illness (mononucleosis), trivial activities, such as leaning over a counter or straining while defecating, can cause a rupture.

==Procedure==
[[Laparoscopy]] is the preferred procedure in cases where the spleen is not too large and when the procedure is elective.   [[Open surgery]] is performed in trauma cases or if the spleen is enlarged.  Either method is major surgery and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. Vaccination for pneumococcus, ''H. influenza'' and meningococcus should be given pre-operatively if possible to minimize the chance of [[overwhelming post-splenectomy infection]] (OPSI), a rapid-developing and potentially fatal type of [[septicaemia]].  The spleen is located and disconnected from its arteries. The ligaments holding the spleen in place are dissected and the organ is removed.  In some cases, one or more [[accessory spleen]]s are discovered and also removed during surgery. The incisions are closed and when indicated, a drain is left. If necessary, tissue samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis.

==Side effects==
As splenectomy causes an increased risk of [[sepsis]] due to encapsulated organisms (such as ''[[S. pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'') the patient should receive the [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine|pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar)]], [[Hib vaccine]], and the [[meningococcal vaccine]]; see [[asplenia]].  These bacteria often cause a sore throat under normal circumstances but after splenectomy, when infecting bacteria cannot be adequately [[opsonize]]d, the infection becomes more severe.

An increase in blood [[leukocytes]] can occur following a splenectomy.<ref name="BMJ1996">{{cite journal | author= | title=Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of infection in patients with an absent or dysfunctional spleen.

==Partial splenectomy==
Much of the spleen's protective roles can be maintained if a small amount of spleen can be left behind.<ref name="pmid957066">{{cite journal |author=Grosfeld JL, Ranochak JE |title=Are hemisplenectomy and/or primary splenic repair feasible? |journal=J.
