'''Atrophic gastritis''' (also known as '''Type A or Type B Gastritis''' more specifically) is a process of chronic [[inflammation]] of the [[stomach]] [[mucosa]], leading to loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues. As a result, the stomach's secretion of essential substances such as [[hydrochloric acid]], [[pepsin]], and [[intrinsic factor]] is impaired, leading to [[digestion|digestive]] problems, [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], and [[megaloblastic anemia]]. It can be caused by persistent infection with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', or can be [[autoimmune]] in origin. Those with the autoimmune version of atrophic gastritis are statistically more likely to develop [[gastric carcinoma]], [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], and [[achlorhydria]].

Type A gastritis primarily affects the body/fundus of the stomach, and is more common with pernicious anemia.

Type B gastritis (most common overall) primarily affects the [[pyloric antrum|antrum]], and is more common with ''H. pylori'' infection.

==Pathophysiology==
''Autoimmune Metaplastic Atrophic Gastritis'' (AMAG) is an inherited form of atrophic gastritis characterized by an immune response directed toward parietal cells and intrinsic factor.<ref name="urlAutoimmune Metaplastic Atrophic Gastritis: Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec02/ch013/ch013d.html |title=Autoimmune Metaplastic Atrophic Gastritis: Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> The presence of serum antibodies to parietal cells and to intrinsic factor are characteristic findings. The autoimmune response subsequently leads to the destruction of parietal cells, which leads to profound [[Achlorhydria|hypochlorhydria]] (and elevated [[gastrin]] levels). The inadequate production of intrinsic factor also leads to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> malabsorption and [[pernicious anemia]]. AMAG is typically confined to the gastric body and fundus.

Hypochlorhydria induces G Cell (Gastrin producing) hyperplasia, which leads to hypergastrinemia. Gastrin exerts a trophic effect on enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells are responsible for histamine secretion) and is hypothesized to be one mechanism to explain the malignant transformation of ECL cells into [[carcinoid]] tumors in AMAG.

==Associated conditions==
Patients with atrophic gastritis are also at increased risk for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma.<ref name="pmid18332421">{{cite journal |author=Giannakis M, Chen SL, Karam SM, Engstrand L, Gordon JI |title=Helicobacter pylori evolution during progression from chronic atrophic gastritis to gastric cancer and its impact on gastric stem cells |journal=Proc.

==Classification==
Atrophic gastritis is classified depending on the level of progress as "close type" or "open type". This classification was advocated by Takemoto and Kimura of [[Tokyo university]] at 1966.

==Causes==
Recent research has shown that AMAG is a result of the immune system attacking the parietal cells, the attack is being triggered by ''H. pylori'' through a mechanism called [[molecular mimicry]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

''Environmental Metaplastic Atrophic Gastritis'' (EMAG) is due to environmental factors, such as diet and ''H. pylori'' infection. EMAG is typically confined to the body of the stomach. Patients with EMAG are also at increased risk of gastric carcinoma.
