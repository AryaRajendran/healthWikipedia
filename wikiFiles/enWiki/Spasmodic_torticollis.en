'''Spasmodic torticollis''' is an extremely painful chronic [[neurological]] [[movement disorder]] causing the neck to involuntarily turn to the left, right, upwards, and/or downwards. The condition is also referred to as "cervical [[dystonia]]". Both agonist and antagonist muscles contract simultaneously during dystonic movement.<ref name="Geyer">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/S1474-4422(06)70547-6|author= Geyer HL, Bressman SB.

|volume=5|issue= 9
|pages=780–790}}</ref>
Causes of the disorder are predominantly [[idiopathic]]. A small number of patients develop the disorder as a result of another disorder or disease. Most patients first experience symptoms midlife. The most common treatment for spasmodic torticollis is the use of [[botulinum toxin]] type A.

==Signs and symptoms==
Initial symptoms of spasmodic torticollis are usually mild. The head may turn or tilt in jerky movements, or sustain a prolonged position involuntarily. Over time, the involuntary spasm of the neck muscles will increase in frequency and strength until it reaches a plateau. Symptoms can also worsen while the patient is walking or during periods of increased stress. Other symptoms include muscle [[hypertrophy]], neck pain, [[dysarthria]] and tremor.<ref name="MDV">{{cite journal|author =Cervical Dystonia Symptoms |date= April 1, 2008

==Classification==
Spasmodic torticollis is a form of focal [[dystonia]], a disorder that is described by sustained muscle contractions causing repetitive and twisting movements, and abnormal postures in a single body region.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richter A, Löscher W |title=Pathology of idiopathic dystonia: findings from genetic animal models |journal=Prog. Neurobiol. |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=633–77 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9560845 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301008297000890 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(97)00089-0}}</ref> There are two main ways to categorize spasmodic torticollis: age of onset, and cause. The disorder is categorized as early onset if the patient is diagnosed before the age of 27, and late onset thereafter. The causes are categorized as either primary ([[idiopathic]]) or secondary ([[symptomatic]]). Spasmodic torticollis can be further categorized by the direction and rotation of head movement.

===Primary===
Primary spasmodic torticollis is defined as having no other abnormality other than dystonic movement and occasional tremor in the neck.<ref name=Geyer/> This type of spasmodic torticollis is usually inherited. Studies have shown that the DYT7 [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] on [[chromosome]] 18p in a German family and the DYT13 locus on [[chromosome]] 1p36 in an Italian family is associated with spasmodic torticollis. The inheritance for both loci is [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]. These loci are all [[autosomal dominant]] inherited with reduced [[penetrance]]. Although these loci have been found, it is still not clear the extent of influence the loci has on spasmodic torticollis.<ref name="Aguiar">{{cite journal |author=de Carvalho Aguiar PM, Ozelius LJ |title=Classification and genetics of dystonia |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=316–25 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12849429 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474442202001370 |doi= 10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00137-0 }}</ref>

===Secondary===
When other conditions lead to spasmodic torticollis, it is said that the spasmodic torticollis is secondary. A variety of conditions can cause brain injury, from external factors to diseases. These conditions are listed below:<ref name=Geyer/>

*[[Perinatal]] [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] injury
* [[Kernicterus]]
* [[Cerebrovascular]] diseases
*Drug induced
* [[Central nervous system]] tumor
* [[Peripheral]] or central [[Physical trauma|trauma]]
*Infectious or post infectious [[encephalopathies]]
*Toxins
*Metabolic
* [[Paraneoplastic]] syndromes
*[[Central pontine myelinolysis]]

Secondary spasmodic torticollis is diagnosed when any of the following are present: history of [[exogenous]] insult of exposure, neurological abnormalities other than dystonia, abnormalities on brain imaging, particularly in the [[basal ganglia]].<ref name=Geyer/>

===Head positions===
To further classify spasmodic torticollis, one can note the position of the head. 

* Torticollis is the horizontal turning (rotational collis) of the head, and uses the [[ipsilateral]] [[Splenius muscles|splenius]], and [[contralateral]] [[Sternocleidomastoid muscle|sternocleidomastoid]] muscles. This is the "chin-to-shoulder" version.
* Laterocollis is the tilting of the head from side to side. This is the "ear-to-shoulder" version. This involves many more muscles: ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid, ipsilateral splenius, ipsilateral scalene complex, ipsilateral [[levator scapulae]], and ipsilateral posterior paravertebrals.
* The flexion of the neck (head tilts forwards) is anterocollis. This is the "chin-to-chest" version and is the most difficult version to address.  This movement utilizes the bilateral sternocleidomastoid, bilateral scalene complex, bilateral submental complex.
* Retrocollis is the extension of the neck (head tilts back) and uses the following muscles for movement: bilateral splenius, bilateral upper [[trapezius]], bilateral deep posterior paravertebrals. This is the "chin-in-the-air" version.

A combination of these head positions is common; many patients experience turning and tilting actions of the head.<ref name="Brashear">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.otot.2004.03.004|author= Brashear A.

==Diagnosis ==
The most commonly used scale to rate the severity of spasmodic torticollis is the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS). It has been shown that this rating system has widespread acceptance for use in clinical trials, and has been shown to have “good interobserver reliability.” <ref>{{cite journal |author=Salvia P, Champagne O, Feipel V, Rooze M, de Beyl DZ |title=Clinical and goniometric evaluation of patients with spasmodic torticollis |journal=Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon) |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=323–9 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16427167 |doi=10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2005.11.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0268-0033(05)00291-3}}</ref>  There are three scales in the TWSTRS: torticollis severity scale, disability scale, and pain scale. These scales are used to represent the severity, the pain, and the general lifestyle of spasmodic torticollis.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Basal-ganglia-coronal-sections-large.png|thumb|300px|right|Coronal sections of human brain labeling the basal ganglia.]]
The pathophysiology of spasmodic torticollis is still relatively unknown. Spasmodic torticollis is considered neurochemical in nature, and does not result in structural neurodegenerative changes. Although no lesions are present in the [[basal ganglia]] in primary spasmodic torticollis, [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] studies have shown abnormalities of the [[basal ganglia]] and hyper activation of the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] areas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vacherot F, Vaugoyeau M, Mallau S, Soulayrol S, Assaiante C, Azulay JP |title=Postural control and sensory integration in cervical dystonia |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=1019–27 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17383228 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2007.01.013 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1388-2457(07)00033-8}}</ref> Studies have suggested that there is a functional imbalance in the striatal control of the [[globus pallidus]], specifically the [[substantia nigra]] pars reticulate. The studies hypothesize the hyper activation of the cortical areas is due to reduced pallidal inhibition of the [[thalamus]], leading to over activity of the medial and prefrontal cortical areas and under activity of the primary [[motor cortex]] during movement.<ref name="Uc">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/S1071-9091(02)00010-4|author= Uc EY, Rodnitzky RL.
|year= 2003
|title= Childhood Dystonia 
|journal= Seminars in Pediatric Neurology
|volume=10|issue= 1
|pages=52–61
|pmid=12785748}}</ref> It has also been suggested that the functional imbalance is due to an imbalance of neurotransmitters such as [[dopamine]], [[acetylcholine]], and [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]]. These neurotransmitters are secreted from the basal ganglia and travel to muscle groups in the neck. An increase in neurotransmitters cause spasms to occur in the neck, resulting in spasmodic torticollis.<ref name=Aguiar/>	
Studies of local field potentials have also shown an increase of 4–10&nbsp;Hz oscillatory activity in the [[globus pallidus internus]] during [[myoclonic]] episodes and an increase of 5–7&nbsp;Hz activity in dystonic muscles when compared to other primary dystonias. This indicates that oscillatory activity in these frequency bands may be involved in the pathophysiology of spasmodic torticollis.<ref name="Tang">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.expneurol.2007.01.010|author= Tang JKH, et al.

|journal= Experimental Neurology
|volume=204|issue= 2
|pages=845–8|pmid= 17307166}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There are several treatments for spasmodic torticollis, the most commonly used being botulinum toxin injections in the dystonic muscle of the neck. Other treatments include [[sensory trick]], oral medications, and deep brain stimulation. Combinations of these treatments have been used to control spasmodic torticollis.<ref name=Tang/> In addition, selective surgical denervation of nerves triggering muscle contractions may offer relief from spasms, pain, and limit damage to the spine as a result of torqued posture.  Spinal fibrosis (i.e., locking of spinal facets due to muscular contortion resulting in fused vertebrates) may occur rapidly.  Therefore, it is important to seriously evaluate the option of surgical denervation as early as possible.

This suggests that the desynchronization of the frequency range is movement related.<ref name=Uc/>
	A sensory trick, also known as a ''geste antagoniste'', is a common characteristic present in focal dystonias, most prevalently in cervical [[dystonia]], however it has also been found in patients with [[blepharospasm]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poisson|first=A.|coauthors=Krack P., Thobois S., Loiraud C., Serra G., Vial C., Broussolle E.|title=History of the "geste antagoniste" sign in cervical dystonia|journal=Journal of Neurology|year=2012|doi=10.1007/s00415-011-6380-7|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>  Sensory tricks offer only temporary and often partial relief of spasmodic torticollis. 74% of patients report only partial relief of spasmodic torticollis compared to 26% of complete relief of torticollis. The sensory trick must also be applied by the patient themselves. When the sensory trick is applied by an examiner, only 32% of patients report relief comparable to relief during self-application.<ref name=Tang/>

===Oral medications===
In the past, [[dopamine]] blocking agents have been used in the treatment of spasmodic torticollis. Treatment was based on the theory that there is an imbalance of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia. These drugs have fallen out of fashion due to various serious side effects: sedation, [[parkinsonism]], and [[tardive dyskinesia]].<ref name="Adam">{{cite journal |author=Adam OR, Jankovic J |title=Treatment of dystonia |journal=Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. |volume=13 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=S362–8 |year=2007 |pmid=18267265 |doi=10.1016/S1353-8020(08)70031-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1353-8020(08)70031-2}}</ref>  
Other oral medications can be used in low doses to treat early stages of spasmodic torticollis. Relief from spasmodic torticollis is higher in those patients who take [[anticholinergic agents]] when compared to other oral medications. 50% of patients who use anticholinergic agents report relief, 21% of patients report relief from [[clonazepam]], 11% of patients report relief from [[baclofen]], and 13% [[benzodiazepines]].<ref name="Crowner">{{cite journal|doi= 10.2522/ptj.20060272|author= Crowner BE. |year= 2007
|title= dystonia: disease profile and clinical management. |journal= Physical Therapy |volume=87|issue= 11
|pages=1511–26|pmid= 17878433}}</ref>  

Higher doses of these medications can be used for later stages of spasmodic torticollis; however, the frequency and severity of side effects associated with the medications are usually not tolerated. Side effects include dry mouth, cognitive disturbance, drowsiness, diplopia, glaucoma, urinary retention.<ref name="Ochudlo">{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2007.01.004|author= Ochudlo S, Drzyzga K, Drzyzga LR, Opala G.

===Botulinum toxin===
[[Image:Presynaptic CNTs targets.svg|thumb|right|200px|Target molecules of botulinum (BoNT) and tetanus (TeNT) toxins inside the axon terminal.[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no10/04-1279.htm]]]
The most commonly used treatment for spasmodic torticollis is the use of botulinum toxin injection in the dystonic musculature. Botulinum toxin type A is most often used; it prevents the release of [[acetylcholine]] from the [[presynaptic]] [[axon]] of the [[motor end plate]], paralyzing the dystonic muscle.<ref name=Adam/> By disabling the movement of the antagonist muscle, the agonist muscle is allowed to move freely. With botulinum toxin injections, patients experience relief from spasmodic torticollis for approximately 12 to 16 weeks.<ref name=cdysg>{{cite journal |author=Velickovic M, Benabou R, Brin MF |title=Cervical dystonia pathophysiology and treatment options |journal=Drugs |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1921–43 |year=2001 |pmid=11708764 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=0012-6667&volume=61&issue=13&spage=1921}}</ref> There are several type A preparations available worldwide; however BOTOX and Dysport are the only preparations approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for clinical use in the United States.

Some patients experience or develop immunoresistance to botulinum toxin type A and must use botulinum toxin type B.  Approximately 4% to 17% of patients develop botulinum toxin type A antibodies. The only botulinum toxin type B accessible in the United States is Myobloc. Treatment using botulinum toxin type B is comparable to type A, with an increased frequency of the side effect dry mouth.<ref name=Brashear/>

Common side effects include pain at the injection site (up to 28%), [[dysphagia]] due to the spread to adjacent muscles (11% to 40%), dry mouth (up to 33%), fatigue (up to 17%), and weakness of the injected or adjacent muscle (up to 56%).<ref name=Adam/>

===Deep brain stimulation===
[[Image:Parkinson surgery.jpg|thumb|150px|Insertion of electrode during surgery]]

[[Deep brain stimulation]] to the basal ganglia and [[thalamus]] has recently been used as a successful treatment for tremors of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]]. This technique is currently being implanted in patients with spasmodic torticollis in clinical trials. These patients are subjected to stimulation of the [[globus pallidus]] internus, or the [[subthalamic nucleus]]. The device is analogous to a [[pacemaker]], an external battery is placed subcutaneously with wires through the skin and enter the skull to a region of the brain. To stimulate the globus pallidus internus, microelectrodes are placed into the globus pallidus internus bilaterally.  After the surgery is performed, multiple trips are required to program the settings for the stimulator. The stimulation of the globus pallidus internus disrupts the abnormal discharge pattern in the globus pallidus internus, resulting in inhibition of hyperactive cortical activity. Globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation is the preferred surgical procedure due to the lower frequency of side effects.<ref name=Adam/>  Advantages of deep brain stimulations include the reversibility of the procedure, and the ability to adjust settings of stimulation.<ref name=Crowner/> 

In one study, patients who have developed immunoresistance to botulinum toxin underwent globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation showed improvement by 54.4% after three to six months. 

There is a low rate of side effects for those who undergo deep brain stimulation. The most common side effect is headaches, occurring in 15% of patients, then infection (4.4%), and cognitive dysfunction (4%). Serious side effects seizure (1.2%), intracerebral hemorrhage (0.6%), intraventricular [[hemorrhage]] (0.6%), and large [[subdural hematoma]] (0.3%).<ref name=Adam/>

===Physical Interventions===
Physical treatment options for cervical dystonia include biofeedback, mechanical braces as well as patients self-performing a [[Sensory trick|geste antagoniste]]. [[Physical therapy]] also has an important role in managing spasmodic torticollis by providing stretching and strengthening exercises to aid the patient in keeping their head in proper alignment with their body.<ref name=cdysg/> Patients with cervical dystonia ranked physical therapy intervention second to botulinum toxin injections in overall effectiveness in reducing symptoms <ref>{{cite journal|last=Silfors|first=Anders|coauthors=and Gӧran Solders|title=Living with dystonia.

==Epidemiology==
Spasmodic torticollis is one of the most common forms of dystonia seen in neurology clinics, occurring in approximately 0.390% of the United States population in 2007 (390 per 100,000).<ref name=Jankovic/> Worldwide, it has been reported that the incidence rate of spasmodic torticollis is at least 1.2 per 100,000 person years,<ref name="Claypool">{{cite journal |author=Claypool DW, Duane DD, [[Duane Ilstrup|Ilstrup DM]], Melton LJ |title=Epidemiology and outcome of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) in Rochester, Minnesota |journal=Mov.

There is a higher prevalence of spasmodic torticollis in females; females are 1.5 times more likely to develop spasmodic torticollis than males. The prevalence rate of spasmodic torticollis also increases with age, most patients show symptoms from ages 50–69. The average onset age of spasmodic torticollis is 41.<ref name=Geyer/>
