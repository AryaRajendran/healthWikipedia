A '''doctor's office''' in [[American English]], or a '''doctor's surgery''' in [[British English]], is a [[medical facility]] in which a [[physician|doctor]], usually a [[general practitioner]] (GP), receives and treats [[patient]]s.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/office Definition at The Free Dictionary]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/surgery_2 surgery noun (ADVICE) - definition in British English Dictionary & Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionary Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Doctors' offices are the primary place where [[ambulatory care]] is given, and are often the first place that a sick person would go for care, except in emergencies, where one would go to an [[emergency department]] at a [[hospital]].<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/doctors/Pages/NHSGPs.aspx Your local GP practice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In most developed countries, where [[healthcare|health services]] are [[Universal health care|guaranteed by the state]] in some form, most [[doctor's visit|visits to doctors]] take place in their offices. In the [[United States]], where this is not the case, many people who cannot afford [[health insurance]] or doctor's visits must either go to free or reduced-cost [[clinic]]s or an emergency department at a hospital for care, instead of a doctor's office.<ref>[http://thebillfold.com/2012/06/how-to-get-health-care-while-uninsured/ How to Get Health Care While Uninsured | The Billfold<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

For healthy people, most visits to doctors' offices revolve around a once-yearly recommended [[physical examination]]. This exam usually consists of gathering information such as a patient's [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]], [[weight]], and [[height]], along with checking for any irregularities or signs of illness around the body.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/annual-physical-examinations Annual Physical Exams: What to Expect<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> GPs will also ask the patients about any [[mental health]] problems that they may be experiencing, and may [[referral (medicine)|refer]] them to a [[psychiatrist]] for further examination in the event that they do indeed have such problems. If there are any other health problems that must be addressed by a [[medical specialist]], such as a [[cardiologist]], a referral will be given.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The staff of a doctor's office usually consists of [[nurse]]s, [[receptionist]]s, and doctors. Sometimes, many doctors of different [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialties]] may be housed in one building, allowing easy [[Referral (medicine)|referrals]].

==Facilities==
Doctors' offices can range from spartan to luxurious. A basic office usually consists of a [[waiting room]] and an examination room. Examination rooms usually consist of an [[examination table]], upon which the patient sits or lies down, and various other equipment, depending on the office. Examples of the types of equipment found in an examination room include:<ref>[http://www.kristensguide.com/Family/Fun_Kid_Stuff/pretend_and_learn_doctor.asp Kristen's Guide]</ref>
