'''Embryo quality''' is the ability of an [[embryo]] to perform successfully either or both in terms of conferring a high [[pregnancy rate]] or/and resulting in a healthy person. '''Embryo profiling''' is the estimation of embryo quality by qualification and/or quantification of various parameters. Estimations of embryo quality guides the choice in [[In_vitro_fertilisation#Embryo_selection|embryo selection in ''in vitro'' fertilization]]. 

==Prediction of pregnancy rates==
In order to optimise [[pregnancy rate]]s (and closely related end-points such as implantation rates), there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos.<ref name=Rebmann>{{Cite journal|author=Rebmann V, Switala M, Eue I, Grosse-Wilde H |title=Soluble HLA-G is an independent factor for the prediction of pregnancy outcome after ART: a German multi-centre study |journal=Hum Reprod |volume= 25|issue= 7|pages= 1691–8|year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20488801 |doi=10.1093/humrep/deq120 |url=}}</ref> However, presence of soluble [[HLA-G]] might be considered as a second parameter if a choice has to be made between embryos of morphologically equal quality.<ref name=Rebmann/> Also, [[two-pronuclear zygote]]s (2PN) transitioning through 1PN or 3PN states tend to develop into poorer-quality embryos than those that constantly remain 2PN.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Reichman DE, Jackson KV, Racowsky C |title=Incidence and development of zygotes exhibiting abnormal pronuclear disposition after identification of two pronuclei at the fertilization check |journal=Fertil.

Also, methods are emerging in making comprehensive analyses of up to entire [[genome]]s, [[transcriptome]]s, [[proteome]]s and [[metabolome]]s which may be used to score embryos by comparing the patterns with ones that have previously been found among embryos in successful versus unsuccessful pregnancies:<ref name=Fauser2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr033}}</ref>
* In transcriptome evaluation, however, [[gene expression profiling]] studies of human embryos are limited due to legal and ethical issues.<ref name=Fauser2011/> An alternative or complement is [[Cumulus cell#Gene expression profiling|gene expression profiling of cumulus cells]] surrounding the oocyte and early embryo, or on [[granulosa cell]]s.<ref name=Fauser2011/> Profiling of cumulus cells can give valuable information regarding the efficiency of an [[ovarian hyperstimulation]] protocol, and may indirectly predict oocyte aneuploidy, embryo development and pregnancy outcomes, without having to perform any invasive procedure directly in the embryo.<ref name=Fauser2011/>
* Proteome profiling of embryos can indirectly be evaluated by sampling of proteins found in the vicinity of embryos, thereby providing a non-invasive method of embryo profiling.<ref name=Fauser2011/> Examples of protein markers evaluated in such profiling include [[CXCL13]] and [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor]], where lower protein amounts are associated with higher implantation rates.<ref name=Fauser2011/>

Another level of opportunity can be achieved by having the evaluation of the embryo profile tailored to the maternal status in regard to, for example health or immune status, potentially further detailed by similar profiling of the maternal genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Two examples of proteins that may be included in maternal profiling are [[endometrium]]-derived [[stathmin 1]] and [[annexin A2]], whose down- and up-regulation, respectively, are associated with higher rates of successful implantation.<ref name=Fauser2011/>

==Health prediction==
{{Further|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
The main method currently used to predict the health of a resultant person of an embryo is [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (also called ''preimplantation genetic screening'', ''preimplantation genetic profiling'' or PGP), in order to determine whether the resultant person will inherit a specific disease or not. On the other hand, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing [[randomized controlled trial]]s came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGP as measured by [[live birth rate]].<ref name=Mastenbroek2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr003 }}</ref> On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGP significantly lowers the live birth rate.<ref name=Mastenbroek2011/> Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and chromosomal mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGP.<ref name=Mastenbroek2011/>
