==Methods==
Birth control includes [[barrier methods]], [[hormonal contraception]], [[intrauterine devices]] (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. Hormones may be [[injectable contraceptives|delivered by injection]], by mouth (orally), [[intravaginal administration|placed in the vagina]], or implanted under the skin. The most common types of oral contraception include the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] and the [[progestogen-only pill]].<ref name="Ammer 2009a">{{cite book|last=Ammer|first=Christine|year=2009|chapter=oral contraceptive|title=The encyclopedia of women's health|edition=6th|location=New York|publisher=Facts On File|isbn=978-0-8160-7407-5|pages=312–315|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=_MRDimrELCIC&pg=PA312&vq=oral+contraceptive}}</ref> Most methods are typically used before sex while [[emergency contraception]] is effective for up to a few days after intercourse.

Determining whether a woman with one or more illnesses, diseases, risk factors, or abnormalities can use a particular form of birth control is a complex medical question sometimes requiring a [[pelvic examination]] or medical tests. The [[World Health Organization]] publishes a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of contraception.<ref name=WHO2009_10>{{cite book|last=Organization|first=World Health|title=Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use|year=2009|publisher=Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241563888|page=1-10|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241563888_eng.pdf|edition=4th ed.}}</ref>

===Barrier===
[[File:Condoms 08293403.jpg|thumb|Male [[condom]]s in the rolled-up position]]
[[Barrier contraceptive]]s are devices that attempt to prevent [[pregnancy]] by physically preventing [[sperm]] from entering the [[uterus]]. They include: male [[condom]]s, [[female condom]]s, [[cervical cap]]s, [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, and [[contraceptive sponge]]s with [[spermicide]].

The condom is most commonly used during [[sexual intercourse]] to reduce the likelihood of [[pregnancy]] and of spreading [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs—such as [[gonorrhea]], [[syphilis]], and [[HIV]]). It is put on a man's erect [[human penis|penis]] and physically blocks ejaculated semen from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from [[latex]], but some are made from other materials such as [[polyurethane]], [[polyisoprene]], or lamb intestine. A [[female condom]] is also available, most often made of [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.

Contraceptive sponges combine a barrier with spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are inserted vaginally prior to intercourse and must be placed over the [[cervix]] to be effective. Typical effectiveness during the first year of use is about 84% overall, and 68% among women who have already given birth.<ref name="hatcher">{{cite book | first=RA | last=Hatcher | coauthors=Trussel J, Stewart F, et al. | year=2000 | title=Contraceptive Technology | edition=18th | publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=0-9664902-6-6 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html }}</ref> The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Some people are allergic to spermicide used in the sponge. Women who use contraceptive sponges have an increased risk of [[yeast infection]]s and [[urinary tract infection]]s. Leaving the sponge in for more than 30 hours can result in [[toxic shock syndrome]].

===Hormonal===
[[Hormonal contraceptive]]s inhibit [[ovulation]] and [[Human fertilization|fertilization]].<ref name="Nelson 2011">{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.<br/>Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.</blockquote></ref> These include [[oral contraceptive|oral pills]], [[subdermal]] implants, and [[injectable contraceptives]] as well as the [[contraceptive patch|patch]], [[hormonal IUD]]s and the [[vaginal ring]]. The most commonly used hormonal contraceptive is the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]—commonly known as "the pill"—which includes a combination of an [[estrogen]] and a [[progestin]] ([[progestogen]]).<ref name="pmid21961825"/> There is also a progestin-only pill.<ref name="pmid21961819"/> Currently, hormonal contraceptives are available only for females.

Combined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slight increased cardiovascular risk, including an increased risk of [[venous thrombosis|venous]] and [[arterial thrombosis]], blood clots that can cause permanent disability or even death. However, the benefits are greater than the risk of pregnancy, because pregnancy also increases those risks.<ref name=Review2011>{{cite journal|last=Brito|first=MB|coauthors=Nobre, F, Vieira, CS|title=Hormonal contraception and cardiovascular system|journal=Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia|date=2011 Apr|volume=96|issue=4|pages=e81–9|pmid=21359483|doi=10.1590/S0066-782X2011005000022|ref=harv}}</ref>

According to the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]], oral contraceptives reduce the risk of [[ovarian cancer]] and [[endometrial cancer]] but increase the risk of [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]]. Some reduce [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]], and several are used to treat mild to moderate [[acne]], however there are risks of blood clots. Some types of combination hormonal contraceptives may reduce the symptoms of [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD) and can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and  [[dysmenorrhea]] (painful menstruation) by replacing menstruation with bleeding that imitates the menstrual cycle but does not regulate it. Lower doses of estrogen required by vaginal administration (i.e., from the vaginal ring or hormonal IUDs instead of the pill) may reduce the breast tenderness, [[nausea]], and headache associated with oral contraceptives for some women.<ref name="pmid21961825">{{cite journal|last=Shulman|first=LP|title=The state of hormonal contraception today: benefits and risks of hormonal contraceptives: combined estrogen and progestin contraceptives.|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology|date=2011 Oct|volume=205|issue=4 Suppl|pages=S9-13|pmid=21961825}}</ref>

Progestin-only pills and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of thromboses and may be used by women with previous venous thrombosis, or hepatitis.<ref name="pmid21961819"/><ref name=Review2011/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Mantha|first=S.|coauthors=Karp, R.; Raghavan, V.; Terrin, N.; Bauer, K.

Uncommon side effects of progestin-only pills, injections, and implants include headache, breast tenderness, mood effects, and [[dysmenorrhea]], but those symptoms often resolve with time.

===Intrauterine devices===
The contemporary [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) is a small 'T'-shaped birth control device, containing either copper or progesterone, which is inserted into the uterus. IUDs are a form of [[long-acting reversible contraception]], the most effective type of reversible birth control.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Winner, B; Peipert, JF; Zhao, Q; Buckel, C; Madden, T; Allsworth, JE; Secura, GM. | year = 2012 | title = Effectiveness of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 21 | pages = 1998–2007 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1110855 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1110855 | pmid=22621627 | ref = harv | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Hormonal IUDs do not increase bleeding as copper-containing IUDs do. Rather, they reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether, and can be used as a treatment for [[menorrhagia|heavy periods]]. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs may be used during breastfeeding whether or not they also include copper.<ref name="pmid8736722"/><ref>{{Cite pmid|9222467|noedit}}</ref>

===Sterilization===
[[Sterilisation (medicine)|Surgical sterilization]] is available in the form of [[tubal ligation]] for women and [[vasectomy]] for men.<ref name=Hopkins2010/> There are no significant long term side effects and tubal ligation decreases the risk of [[ovarian cancer]].<ref name=Hopkins2010/> Some women regret such a decision: about 5% over 30 years, and about 20% under 30.<ref name=Hopkins2010/> Short term complications are less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation.<ref name=Hopkins2010/> Neither method offers protection from [[sexually transmitted infections]].<ref name=Hopkins2010/>

Although sterilization is considered a permanent procedure, it is possible to attempt a [[tubal reversal]] to reconnect the [[fallopian tubes]] in females or a [[vasectomy reversal]] to reconnect the [[vasa deferentia]] in males. The rate of success depends on the original technique, tubal damage, and the person's age.

===Behavioral===
Behavioral methods involve [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods|regulating the timing]] or methods of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present.<ref name="pmid15495128"/> If used properly the failure rate is about 3.4%, however if used poorly failure rates may approach 85% for a year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Ruth|title=Breastfeeding : a guide for the medical professional.|year=2010|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9781437707885|page=673|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=jhQ2zHnKEKwC&pg=PA673|edition=7th ed.}}</ref>

====Lactation====
The [[lactational amenorrhea method]], or LAM, involves the use of a woman's natural [[postpartum infertility]] which occurs after delivery and may be extended by [[breastfeeding]].<ref name=Blackburn2007>{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Susan Tucker|title=Maternal, fetal, & neonatal physiology : a clinical perspective|year=2007|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9781416029441|page=157|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=2y6zOSQcn14C&pg=PA157|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref> This usually requires the presence of no [[menstruation |periods]], exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months.<ref name=Blenning2005>{{cite journal|last=Blenning|first=CE|coauthors=Paladine, H|title=An approach to the postpartum office visit.|journal=American family physician|date=2005 Dec 15|volume=72|issue=12|pages=2491-6|pmid=16370405}}</ref> If breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition the [[World Health Organization]] states that it is 98% effective in the six months following delivery.<ref>{{cite web |title=WHO 10 facts on breastfeeding |work=World Health Organization |month=April | year=2005 |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/facts/en/index2.html}}</ref> Trials have found effectiveness rates between 92.5% and 100%.<ref name=Vander2003/> Effectiveness decreases to 93-96% at one year and 87% at two years.<ref name=Fritz2012>{{cite book|last=Fritz|first=Marc|title=Clinical Gynecologic Endocrinology and Infertility|year=2012|isbn=9781451148473|page=1007-1008|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=KZLubBxJEwEC&pg=PA1007}}</ref> Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a [[pacifier]], and feeding solids all reduce its effectiveness. <ref>{{cite book|last=Swisher|first=Judith Lauwers, Anna|title=Counseling the nursing mother a lactation consultant's guide|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=9781449619480|page=465-466|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=2X0_Takcr_wC&pg=PA465|edition=5th ed.}}</ref>  In those who are exclusively breastfeeding about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months.<ref name=Fritz2012/> In those who are not breastfeeding fertility may return four weeks after delivery.<ref name=Fritz2012/>

====Fertility awareness====
[[File:Geburtenkontrollkette.jpg|thumb|alt=a birth control chain calendar necklace|A [[CycleBeads]] birth control chain, used for a rough estimate of fertility based on days since menstruation]]
Fertility awareness methods are used by about 3.6% of couples.<ref name=Sivin2010/> [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods]] such as the discredited rhythm method and the [[Standard Days Method]] estimate the likelihood of fertility based on the length of past menstrual cycles.<ref name="pmid15495128">{{cite journal|last=Grimes|first=DA|coauthors=Gallo, MF; Grigorieva, V; Nanda, K; Schulz, KF|title=Fertility awareness-based methods for contraception.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2004 Oct 18|issue=4|pages=CD004860|pmid=15495128}}</ref>{{clarify|date=May 2013}} To avoid pregnancy with fertility awareness, unprotected sex is restricted to a woman's least fertile period. During her most fertile period, barrier methods may be used, or she may abstain from intercourse. The term "[[natural family planning]]" (NFP) is sometimes used to refer to any use of fertility awareness. However, this term specifically refers to the practices that are permitted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The effectiveness of [[fertility awareness]]-based methods of contraception is unknown because of the lack of completed standardized and [[scientific control|controlled scientific trials]].<ref name="pmid15495128"/> More effective than calendar-based methods, systems of fertility awareness that track basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or both, are known as symptoms-based methods. Teachers of symptoms-based methods take care to distance their systems from the poor reputation of the rhythm method.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weschler |first=Toni |title=Fertility Myths |work=Ovusoft |publisher=Taking Charge of Your Fertility |url=http://www.ovusoft.com/library/myths.asp#19 |accessdate=2008-04-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080422205032/http://www.ovusoft.com/library/myths.asp#19 |archivedate = 2008-04-22}}</ref> Many consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years, and some even exclude calendar-based methods from their definition of fertility awareness.<ref name="tcoyf">{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | pages=3–4 | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}</ref>

The [[Standard Days Method]] has a simpler rule set and is more effective than the rhythm method.<ref name="hatcher"/> The Standard Days Method has a typical failure rate of 12% per year.<ref name="Arévalo M, Jennings V, Sinai I 2002 333–8">{{cite journal |author=Arévalo M, Jennings V, Sinai I |title=Efficacy of a new method of family planning: the Standard Days Method | journal = Contraception | volume = 65 | issue = 5 |pages=333–8 |year=2002 | pmid = 12057784 | url=http://pdf.dec.org/pdf_docs/PNACQ416.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(02)00288-3|format=PDF |ref=harv}}</ref> A product called [[CycleBeads]] was developed alongside the method to help the user keep track of estimated high and low fertility points during her menstrual cycle. The Standard Days Method may only be used by women whose cycles are always between 26 and 32 days in length. In this system:
* Days 1-7 of a woman's menstrual cycle are considered infertile
* Days 8-19 are considered fertile; considered unsafe for unprotected intercourse
* From Day 20 onwards, infertility is considered to resume

Symptoms-based methods of fertility awareness involve a woman's observation and charting of her body's fertility signs, to determine the fertile and infertile phases of her cycle. Charting may be done by hand or with the assistance of [[fertility monitor]]s. Most methods track one or more of the three primary fertility signs:<ref name="tcoyf">{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | page=52 | edition=Revised |publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}</ref> changes in [[basal body temperature]], in cervical mucus, and in cervical position. If a woman tracks both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as "symptothermal." Other bodily cues such as [[mittelschmerz]] are considered secondary indicators. Unplanned pregnancy rates have been reported from 1% to 20% for typical users of the symptothermal method.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pallone|first=SR|coauthors=Bergus, GR|title=Fertility awareness-based methods: another option for family planning.|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=2009 Mar-Apr|volume=22|issue=2|pages=147-57|pmid=19264938}}</ref>

====Withdrawal====

Estimates of the effectiveness of a birth control method are generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using the method in the first year of use. Thus, if 100 women use a method that has a 0 percent first-year failure rate, then 0 of the women should become pregnant during the first year of use. This equals 0 pregnancies per 100 woman-years, an alternative unit. Sometimes the effectiveness is expressed in lifetime failure rate, more commonly among methods with high effectiveness, such as [[vasectomy]] after the appropriate negative semen analysis.<ref>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=597295175&linkID=10752&cook=no GPnotebook > failure rate ( vasectomy )] Retrieved on January 4, 2009</ref>

The most effective methods in typical use are those that do not depend upon regular user action. Surgical sterilization, Depo-Provera, implants, and [[intrauterine device]]s (IUDs) all have first-year failure rates of less than one percent for perfect use. In reality, however, ''perfect'' use may not be the case, but still, sterilization, implants, and IUDs also have ''typical'' failure rates under one percent. The typical failure rate of Depo-Provera is disagreed upon, with figures ranging from less than one percent up to three percent.<ref name="Trussell 1998">{{cite book |author=Trussell, James |year=1998 |editor=Hatcher, Robert A. et al.

Other methods may be highly effective if used consistently and correctly, but can have typical use first-year failure rates that are considerably higher due to incorrect or ineffective usage by the user. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. In one survey, typical use first-year failure rates of hormonal contraceptive pills (and by extrapolation, patches or rings) were as high as five percent per year. 

Intrauterine devices were once associated with health risks, but most recent models of the IUD, including the ParaGard and Mirena, are both extremely safe and effective, and require very little maintenance.<ref name="guttmacher2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/10/4/gpr100419.html|title= Popularity Disparity: Attitudes About the IUD in Europe and the United States|publisher= Published by [http://www.guttmacher.org/archive/GPR.jsp Guttmacher Policy Review] Published Fall 2007|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Condoms and cervical barriers such as the diaphragm have similar typical use first-year failure rates (14 and 20 percent, respectively), but perfect usage of the condom is more effective (three percent first-year failure vs six percent) and condoms have the additional feature of helping to prevent the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[HIV/AIDS]]. 

The withdrawal method, if used consistently and correctly, has a first-year failure rate of four percent. Due to the difficulty of consistently using withdrawal correctly, it has a typical use first-year failure rate of 19 percent, and is not recommended by some medical professionals.<ref name="Trussell 1998" /><ref name="skouby">{{cite journal |author=Skouby SO |title=Contraceptive use and behavior in the 21st century: a comprehensive study across five European countries |journal=Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care |volume=9 |issue=2|pages=57–68 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15449817 |doi=10.1080/13625180410001715681 |ref=harv }}</ref> Fertility awareness methods as a whole have typical use first-year failure rates as between 12 and 25 percent; perfect use effectiveness depends on which system is used and are typically 1 to 9 percent.<ref name=Hopkins2010/> The evidence on which these estimates are based however is poor.<ref name="pmid15495128"/>

==History==
<!-- linked from redirect [[History of birth control]] -->
{{Further|Timeline of reproductive rights legislation}}
From ancient times women have extended breastfeeding induced [[lactational amenorrhea]] in an effort to avoid a new pregnancy. The [[Book of Genesis]] references withdrawal, or [[coitus interruptus]], as a method of contraception when [[Onan]] "spills his seed" (ejaculates) on the ground so as to not father a child with his [[widow inheritance|deceased brother's wife]] [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]]. The [[Talmud]] states that "there are three women that may cohabit with a sponge: a minor, a pregnant woman and one that nurses her child". Subsequent commentaries clarify that the "sponge" was an absorbent material, such as cotton or wool, intended to block [[sperm]].<ref name="Middleberg 2003 4">{{Cite book| last = Middleberg| first = Maurice I.| title = Promoting reproductive security in developing countries| publisher = Springer|year = 2003| page = 4| url =http://books.google.com/?id=8LR7GSmNGUsC&dq=Avicenna++Muhammad+ibn+Zakariya+ar-Razi+birth+control| isbn = 978-0-306-47449-1}}</ref>

[[File:Silphium.jpg|thumb|alt=ancient coin depicting silphium|Ancient silver coin from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] depicting a stalk of [[silphium]] ]]
Birth control and abortion are well documented in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. One of the earliest documents explicitly referring to birth control methods is the [[Kahun Gynecological Papyrus]] from about 1850 BCE. It describes various contraceptive [[pessary|pessaries]], including [[acacia gum]], which recent research has confirmed to have [[spermicide|spermatocidal]] qualities and is still used in contraceptive jellies. Other birth control methods mentioned in the papyrus include the application of gummy substances to cover the "mouth of the womb" (i.e. the [[cervix]]), a mixture of honey and [[sodium carbonate]] applied to the inside of the [[vagina]], and a pessary made from crocodile dung. [[Lactation]] (breast-feeding) of up to three years was also used for birth control purposes in ancient Egypt.<ref name=Lipsey2005>{{cite book |last1=Lipsey |first1= Richard G. |last2=Carlaw |first2=Kenneth|last3=Bekar |first3=Clifford |chapter=Historical Record on the Control of Family Size|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=tSrGTMtBv50C&pg=PA335 |pages=335–40 |title=Economic Transformations: General Purpose Technologies and Long-Term Economic Growth |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-928564-8}}</ref>

Plants with contraceptive properties were used in [[Ancient Greece]] from the 7th century BCE onwards and documented by numerous ancient writers on [[gynaecology]], such as [[Hippocrates]]. The botanist [[Theophrastus]] documented the use of [[Silphium]], a plant well known for its contraceptive and [[abortifacient]] properties. The plant only grew on a small strip of land near the coastal city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (located in modern day [[Libya]]), with attempts to cultivate it elsewhere failing. Its price increased due to high demand, leading to it being worth "more than its weight in silver" by the 1st century BC. The high demand eventually led to the extinction of Silphium during the third or 2nd century BC. [[Asafoetida]], a close relative of siliphion, was also used for its contraceptive properties. Other plants commonly used for birth control in ancient Greece include Queen Anne's lace ([[Daucus carota]]), [[willow]], [[date palm]], [[pomegranate]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[Artemisia (plant)|artemisia]], [[myrrh]], and [[rue]]. Some of these plants are toxic and ancient Greek documents specify safe dosages. Recent studies have confirmed the birth control properties of many of these plants, confirming for example that Queen Anne's lace has post coital anti-fertility properties. Queen Anne's lace is still used today for birth control in [[India]]. Like their neighboring ancient Greeks, [[Ancient Romans]] practiced contraception and [[abortion]].<ref name=Lipsey2005/>

=== Ancient Far East ===
In the 7th century BC, the Chinese physician Master Tung-hsuan documented both [[coitus reservatus]] and coitus obstructus, which prevents the release of semen during intercourse. However, it is not known if these methods were used primarily as birth control methods or to preserve the man's [[Yin and yang|yang]]. In the same century Sun Ssu-mo documented the "thousand of gold contraceptive prescription" for women who no longer want to bear children. This prescription, which was supposed to induce sterility, was made of oil and quicksilver heated together for one day and taken orally.<ref name="Middleberg 2003 4"/>

Indians used a variety of birth control methods since ancient times, including a potion made of powdered [[Palm tree|palm leaf]] and [[Sanguine|red chalk]], as well as vaginal suppositories made of [[honey]], [[ghee]], [[rock salt]] or the seeds of the palasa tree. A variety of birth control prescriptions, mainly made up of herbs and other plants, are listed in the 12th century [[Ratirahasya]] ("Secret of Love") and the [[Anangaranga]] ("The Stage of the God of Love").<ref name="Middleberg 2003 4"/>

=== Early Islam ===
In the late 9th to early 10th century, the Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] documents [[coitus interruptus]], preventing ejaculation and the use of suppositories to block the [[cervix]] as birth control methods. He describes a number of suppositories, including elephant dung, [[cabbages]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], used alone or in combination.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-first= Vern L. |editor-last= Bullough |title= Encyclopedia of Birth Control |year= 2001 |page= 154 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |isbn= 978-1-57607-533-3 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=XuX-MGTZnJoC&lpg=PA154&dq=Muhammad%20ibn%20Zakariya%20al-Razi%20cabbage%20elephant&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q=Muhammad%20ibn%20Zakariya%20al-Razi%20cabbage%20elephant&f=false |accessdate= September 19, 2012}}</ref> During the same period [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]] documents the use of suppositories made of rock salt for women for whom [[pregnancy]] may be dangerous.

On December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a papal bull in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the [[Inquisition]] to proceed "correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising" witches "according to their deserts." In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the "Witch-Bull of 1484", the witches were explicitly accused of having "slain infants yet in the mother's womb" (abortion) and of "hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving" (contraception).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080523174317/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00e.html ''The Bull of Innocent VIII''] as published in the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' translated by [[Montague Summers]]</ref> Famous texts that served to guide the witch hunt and instruct magistrates on how to find and convict so-called "witches" include the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', and [[Jean Bodin]]'s ''De la demonomanie des sorciers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvh.univ-tours.fr/Consult/index.asp?numfiche=221 |title=Jean Bodin (1580).

Barrier methods such as the [[condom]] have been around much longer, but were seen primarily as a means of preventing [[sexually transmitted diseases]], not pregnancy.

Restrictive legislation on birth control was continually employed by European governments throughout the period of [[mercantilism]] and formed the backbone of the populationist strategy of this era. The mercantilists argued that a large population was a form of wealth, making it possible to create bigger markets and armies. The intense violence during the mercantilist era of the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe can be seen as a result of successful political implementation of [[population growth]] by means of restricting birth control, which created an enormous [[youth bulge]]. This youth bulge, as explained by [[War#Youth bulge theory|the theory of that name]], in turn fueled [[Imperialism|imperialist expansion]] of the European empires.<ref>{{Cite report |first= Lionel |last= Beehner |date= April 27, 2007 |title= The Effects of 'Youth Bulge' on Civil Conflicts |publisher= Council on Foreign Relations |type= backgrounder |url= http://www.cfr.org/society-and-culture/effects-youth-bulge-civil-conflicts/p13093#p3 |accessdate= September 19, 2012}}</ref>

Birth control was a contested political issue in Britain during the 19th century. [[Malthusian]]s were in favour of limiting population growth and therefore promoted birth control through organisations such as the [[Malthusian League]], while the idea was opposed by a variety of groups, for different reasons, from the [[socialist]]s to the [[established church]].

In the United Kingdom, birth rates declined from almost 35.5 births per 1,000 in the 1870s to about 29 per 1,000 by 1900. While the cause is uncertain, the 29% decline within a generation shows that the birth control methods [[Women in the Victorian era|Victorian women]] used were effective. The trial of [[Charles Bradlaugh]] and [[Annie Besant]] for republishing [[Charles Knowlton#Fruits of Philosophy|Charles Knowlton's ''The Fruits of Philosophy'']] popularized the book and taught many women about contraception and how to avoid pregnancy. While the rhythm method was not yet understood, condoms and diaphragms made of [[vulcanized rubber]] were reliable and inexpensive.<ref name="draznin2001">{{cite book | title=Victorian London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day (#179) | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Draznin, Yaffa Claire | year=2001 | series=Contributions in Women's Studies | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=98–100 | isbn=0-313-31399-7}}</ref>

Contraception was legal in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s the [[Comstock Act]] and various state ''[[Comstock laws]]'' outlawed the distribution of information about [[safe sex]] and contraception and the use of contraceptives.

The birth control campaigner [[Marie Stopes]], who had opened Britain's first birth control clinic in 1921 and made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by framing it in scientific terms, also gained an international reputation. On opening their birth control clinic on  9 November 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth, the Malthusian League commented that the clinic which Marie Stopes 'and her equally courageous and public-spirited husband' opened nine months earlier was the first in the British Empire (but not the first in the world).

===Late 20th century===
In 1965, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' that a [[Connecticut]] law prohibiting the use of contraceptives violated the constitutional "right to marital privacy". In 1972, the case ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' expanded the right to possess and use contraceptives to unmarried couples.

In France, the [[1920 in France|1920]] Birth Law contained a clause that criminalized dissemination of birth-control literature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soubiran|first=Andre|title=Diary of a Woman in White|publisher=Avon Books|year=1969|edition=English|page=61}}</ref> That law, however, was annulled in 1967 by the Neuwirth Law, thus authorizing contraception, which was followed in 1975 with the Veil Law. Women fought for reproductive rights and they helped end the nation's ban on birth control in 1965.<ref name=Hunt2009>Hunt, Lynn, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, R.

The availability of [[contraception in the Republic of Ireland]] was illegal in the [[Irish Free State]] (later the [[Republic of Ireland]]) from 1935 until 1980, when it was legalised with strong restrictions, later loosened. This reflected [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]]. In Italy women gained the right to access birth control information in 1970.<ref name=Hunt2009/>

In the [[Soviet Union]] birth control was made readily available to facilitate social equality between men and women. [[Alexandra Kollontai]], USSR commissar for public welfare, promoted birth control education for adults. A recent, well-studied example of governmental restriction of birth control in order to promote higher birth rates was the post-World War II [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] era in [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gail Kligman|title=The politics of duplicity: controlling reproduction in Ceausescu's Romania|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nXuaVeRortkC|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=6 July 1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21075-2}}</ref><ref>Lataianu, M.

===Public policy===
The [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s opposition towards birth control continues to this day and has been a major influence on U.S. policies concerning the problem of population growth and unrestricted access to birth control.<ref>Mumford, S.D.

Recently, as an implementation policy of the 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], the Department of Health and Human Services developed a [[contraceptive mandate|mandate]] to require all insurance policies to provide free contraceptives. In 2012, the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] led an attempt to exempt insurance policies sponsored or paid for by religious institutions opposed to birth control on religious or moral grounds, from the mandate to provide free contraceptive care. The GOP opposition to this mandate is based on the view that it violates the "[[Free Exercise Clause]]" of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The bill was dismissed by the [[U.S. Senate]] by a vote of 51-48 along largely partisan lines and is viewed as a victory for President [[Barack Obama]]'s health care law.<ref>Morgan, D. and Ferraro, T.

====International law====
Seven measures required by the [[human rights]] standards of [[international law]] for governments to eliminate unmet need for family planning and achieve universal access to contraceptive information and services have been put forwards:<ref name="hrintlaw">{{cite journal | author = Cottingham J., Germain A., Hunt P. | year = 2012 | title = Use of human rights to meet the unmet need for family planning | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9837| pages = 172–180 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60732-6 | pmid = 22784536 | ref = harv }}</ref>

{|class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Priority measures required by human rights standards and principles for governments to eliminate the unmet need for family planning:<ref name="hrintlaw"/>
|-
! National and sub-national plans for sexual and reproductive health education, information, and services, including family planning
| Design plans, through a participatory process, to provide universal access (not only for married but also for unmarried people, adolescents, others marginalised by income, occupation, or other factors); to encompass all appropriate public, private, national, and international actors; and to include certain features, such as objectives and how they are to be achieved, timeframes, a detailed budget, financing, reporting, indicators, and benchmark measures.
|-
! Removal of legal and regulatory barriers
| Remove barriers that impede access to sexual and reproductive health education, information, and services, including family planning, particularly by disadvantaged groups.
|-
! Commodities
| Make available the widest feasible range of safe and effective modern contraceptives, including emergency contraception, as enumerated in a national List of Essential Medicines based on the WHO Model List and delivered through all appropriate public and private channels.
|-
! Community-based and clinic-based health workers
|Train adequate numbers of health workers who are skilled and supervised to provide good quality sexual and reproductive health services, including full and accurate contraceptive information and modern contraceptives, using the local language and exercising respect for privacy, confidentiality, diversity, and other basic ethical and human rights values.
|-
! Health facilities
| Provide health facilities that are clean, provide seating and privacy for user—provider interaction, are adequately stocked and equipped, adhere to published hours of services, and inform users of their [[reproductive rights|rights]].
|-
! Financial access
| Provide state subsidies and community insurance schemes to allow access for people who would not otherwise be able to afford services.
|-
! Monitoring and accountability
| Establish mechanisms that provide effective, accessible, transparent, and continuous review of the quality of services; assess progress toward equitable access and other objectives; and check that the commitments of all stakeholders are met.
|}

Governments have a formal legal obligation to do all they reasonably can to put these measures in place as a matter of urgent priority, and failing to do so without a compelling reason places them in breach of binding international treaty obligations pertaining to health and human rights.<ref name="hrintlaw"/> Cottingham ''et al.'' recommend that governments, NGOs, health-care providers and citizen advocates act to compel enforcement of these obligations to secure the existence and support of effective and inclusive birth control policies, improve the quality of reproductive health services, and achieve universal access to reproductive health including family planning. Guidance and assistance are available to help meet these obligations. For example, a [[World Health Organization]] publication can help identify inconsistencies between national laws and international human rights obligations (e.g., denying unmarried women contraceptive services.)<ref name="pmid20616975">{{Cite pmid|20616975|noedit}}</ref> WHO staff can assist with removal of such barriers to access to and the provision of high quality sexual and reproductive health services, which can help meet the considerable remaining need for family planning.<ref name="pmid20616975"/>

The United Nations created the "Every Woman Every Child initiative" to asses the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs and modern family planning services.<ref name=Gutt2012>{{cite journal|coauthors=Susheela Singh and Jacqueline E. Darroch|title=Adding It Up: Costs and Benefits of Contraceptive Services Estimates for 2012|journal=Guttmacher Institute and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 201|year=2012|month=June|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/AIU-2012-estimates.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>  These initiatives have set their goals in terms of expected increases in the number of users of modern methods because this is a direct indicator that typically increases in response to interventions.<ref name=Gutt2012/> In previous years, London began the London Summit on Family Planning in an effort to make modern contraceptive services accessible to an added 120 million women in the world's poorest 69 countries by the year 2020.<ref name=Gutt2012/> A goal of this initiative is reduce the number of women who have an "unmet need" for modern methods. The Summit wants to eradicate discrimination or coercion against girls who seek contraceptives.

Another initiative is the Millennium Development Goals which was established in 2000 by 193 United Nations member states and 23 international organizations.<ref name=MDG>{{cite web|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|publisher=UN Web Services Section, Department of Public Information}}</ref>  There are eight goals aimed at reducing inequality.

====Sex education====
[[File:Barbara-Hastings-Asatourian.jpg|thumb|alt=teacher with sex education instructional materials|Barbara Hastings-Asatourian of the [[University of Salford]] demonstrates "Contraception", a sex education board game played in UK schools.]]

Many teenagers, most commonly in developed countries, receive some form of [[sex education]] in school. What information should be provided in such programs is hotly contested, especially in the United States and United Kingdom. Topics include reproductive anatomy, human sexual behavior, information on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), social aspects of sexual interaction, negotiating skills intended to help teens follow through with a decision to remain abstinent or to use birth control during sex, and information on birth control methods.

One type of sex education program used in some more conservative areas of the United States is called [[abstinence-only education]], and it generally promotes complete [[sexual abstinence]] until [[marriage]]. The programs do not encourage the use of birth control, often provide inaccurate information about contraceptives and sexuality, stress failure rates of condoms and other contraceptives, and teach strategies for avoiding sexually intimate situations.<ref>{{cite news |first= Ceci |last= Connolly |title= Some Abstinence Programs Mislead Teens, Report Says|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26623-2004Dec1.html |work= The Washington Post |page=A01|date= 2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-05-23 }}</ref> Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence only education, compared to comprehensive sex education.<ref name="pmid18923389"/><ref name="pmid18703454"/><ref name="pmid18453234"/> Abstinence-only sex education programs show an increase in the rates of pregnancy and STDs of a teenage population in [[randomized controlled trial]]s.<ref name="pmid12065267">{{cite journal |author=DiCenso A, Guyatt G, Willan A, Griffith L |title=Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomised controlled trials | journal = BMJ | volume = 324 | issue = 7351 |page=1426 |year=2002 | pmid = 12065267 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426 |pmc=115855 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=February 23, 2005|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2005/02/sex-education.aspx |accessdate=2006-08-11 }}</ref> Professional medical organizations, including the [[American Medical Association|AMA]], [[American Academy of Pediatrics|AAP]], [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]], [[American Public Health Association|APHA]], [[American Psychological Association|APA]], and [[Adolescent medicine|Society for Adolescent Medicine]], support comprehensive sex education (providing both abstinence and contraceptive information) and oppose the sole use of abstinence-only sex education.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kaplan, David W. |year=2002 |title=Prepared Statement.

=== Misconceptions ===
Modern misconceptions and [[urban legend]]s have given rise to false claims. Here are the arguments against those false claims:

[[Douche|Douching]] with any substance immediately following intercourse does not work as a contraceptive. While it may seem like a sensible idea to try to wash the ejaculate out of the vagina, it is not effective for birth control. Due to the nature of the fluids and the structure of the female reproductive tract, douching most likely actually spreads semen further towards the uterus. Douching is neither a contraceptive nor a preventative measure against STDs or other infections.

A female can become pregnant the first time she engages in sexual intercourse, even if she has not yet had her first[[menstrual cycle|period]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|19305342|noedit}}</ref>

While women are usually less fertile for the first few days of menstruation, a woman can get pregnant if she has sex during her[[menstrual cycle|period]].<ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley | coauthors=Sheila Kippley | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2|pages=108–111, 148 }}, which cites:

Though intrauterine devices are popular in many parts of the world, many people in the United States believe they are dangerous, probably in large part due to the widely publicized health risks associated with an IUD model called the [[Dalkon Shield]].

===Males===
{{Main|Male contraceptive}}
Other than condoms and withdrawal, there is currently only one common method of birth control available: undergoing a [[vasectomy]], a minor surgical procedure wherein the vasa deferentia of a man are severed, and then tied/sealed in a manner which prevents sperm from entering the seminal stream (ejaculate). Several methods are in research and development:

*As of 2007, a chemical called [[Adjudin]] was in Phase II human trials as a [[male oral contraceptive]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Male Contraceptive Methods Are in the Pipeline |author=Finn, Robert |journal=Ob. Gyn. News |volume=42|page=28 |date=May 1, 2007|url=http://www.obgynnews.com/article/PIIS0029743707703956/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0029-7437(07)70395-6 | ref=harv}}</ref>
* [[Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance]] (RISUG) consists of injecting a polymer gel, [[styrene maleic anhydride]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], into the [[vas deferens]]. The polymer has a positive charge, and when negatively charged sperm pass through the vas deferens, the charge differential severely damages the sperm. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility.<ref name=PPAA>{{cite web|title=Expanding Options for Male Contraception|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2011/08/08/expanding-options-for-male-contraception/|publisher=[[Planned Parenthood]] Advocates of Arizona|accessdate=1 April 2012|month=8 August|year=2011}}</ref>
* Experiments in [[vas-occlusive contraception]] involve an implant placed in the [[vasa deferentia]].
* Experiments in [[heat-based contraception]] involve heating the testicles to a high temperature for a short period of time. Ultrasound is the application of high-frequency sound waves to the testes, which can absorb the sound waves' energy as heat, leading to temporary infertility.<ref name="PPAA"/>
* Research on the safety and effectiveness of using [[ultrasound]] treatments to kill sperm has undergone since the idea originally came about following experiments in the 1970s by Mostafa S. Fahim which noticed ultrasound killed microbes and decreased fertility.<ref name=Murray>{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Rheana|title=Ultrasound kills sperm, could be the future of male birth control: study|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19843262|publisher=[[Daily News (New York){{!}}Daily News]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|month=30 January|year=2012}}</ref> As of 2012 a study conducted on rats found that two 15 minute treatments of ultrasound delivered 2 days apart in a warm salt bath effectively lowered their sperm count to below fertile levels.<ref name=Murray/> Further experiments on its effectiveness on humans, the longevity of the results, and its safety have yet to be conducted.<ref name=Murray/>

===Other animals===
Artificial contraception is now being considered as an alternative to hunting as a means of controlling the [[overpopulation in wild animals|population of animals which overbreed]].<ref name="Boyle 2009">{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Rebecca|date=March 3, 2009|title=Birth control for animals: a scientific approach to limiting the wildlife population explosion|work=Popular Science|location=New York|publisher=[http://www.popsci.com/about-us PopSci.com]|url=http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-03/birth-control-animals?single-page-view=true}}</ref>
