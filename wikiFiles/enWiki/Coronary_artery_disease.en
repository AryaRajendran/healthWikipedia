'''Coronary artery disease''' ('''CAD'''; also '''atherosclerotic heart disease''') is the most common type of [[heart disease]] and cause of [[heart attack]]s.<ref name="MountSinai_CAD">[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/service-areas/heart/areas-of-care/heart-attack-coronary-artery-disease Heart attack/coronary artery disease] - [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]]</ref>  The disease is caused by [[atheroma|plaque]] building up along the inner walls of the [[Coronary circulation|arteries of the heart]], which narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow to the heart.  It is the leading cause of death worldwide.<ref name="MountSinai_CAD" /> 

While the symptoms and signs of coronary artery disease are noted in the advanced state of disease, most individuals with coronary artery disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms, often a "sudden" [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], finally arises.  After decades of progression, some of these [[atheroma|atheromatous plaques]] may rupture and (along with the activation of the [[blood clot]]ting system) start limiting [[blood flow]] to the [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]]. The disease is the most common cause of [[cardiac arrest|sudden death]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomas AC, Knapman PA, Krikler DM, Davies MJ |title=Community study of the causes of "natural" sudden death |journal=BMJ |volume=297 |issue=6661 |pages=1453–6 |year=1988 |month=December |pmid=3147014 |pmc=1835183 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.297.6661.1453}}</ref> and is also the most common reason for death of men and women over 20 years of age.<ref name=AHA>American Heart Association: [http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3000090 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics]-2007 Update. AHA, Dallas, Texas, 2007</ref>
According to present trends in the United States, half of healthy 40-year-old males will develop CAD in the future, and one in three healthy 40-year-old women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosamond W, Flegal K, Friday G |title=Heart disease and stroke statistics--2007 update: a report from the American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Subcommittee |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=e69–171 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17194875 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.179918 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/115/5/e69/TBL3179728}}</ref> According to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], [[Northern Ireland]] is the country with the most occurrences of CAD. By contrast, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] of Africa have almost no heart disease.

As the degree of coronary artery disease progresses, there may be near-complete obstruction of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the coronary artery, severely restricting the flow of oxygen-carrying blood to the [[myocardium]].  Individuals with this degree of coronary artery disease typically have suffered from one or more [[myocardial infarction]]s (heart attacks), and may have signs and symptoms of chronic coronary [[ischemia]], including symptoms of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] at rest and flash [[pulmonary edema]].

A distinction should be made between myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction.  Ischemia means that the amount of blood supplied to the tissue is inadequate to supply the needs of the tissue.  When the myocardium becomes ischemic, it does not function optimally.  When large areas of the myocardium becomes ischemic, there can be impairment in the relaxation and contraction of the myocardium.  If the blood flow to the tissue is improved, myocardial ischemia can be reversed.  Infarction means that the tissue has undergone irreversible death due to lack of sufficient oxygen-rich blood.

An individual may develop a rupture of an atheromatous plaque at ''any'' stage of the spectrum of coronary artery disease. The acute rupture of a plaque may lead to an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).

==Pathophysiology==
Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes [[ischemia]] (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the myocardial cells.  Myocardial cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly called a heart attack). It leads to [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] damage, [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] death and later [[myocardial scarring]] without [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] regrowth. Chronic high-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into ventricular fibrillation leading to death.

CAD is associated with [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]].   A number of recent studies have shown that family history of early CAD is an important predictor of CAD.  Most of the familial association of coronary artery disease may be related to common dietary habits. Screening for CAD includes evaluating [[High density lipoprotein|high-density]] and [[Low density lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein]] ([[cholesterol]]) levels and [[triglyceride]] levels.  Despite much press, most of the alternative risk factors including homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), Lipoprotein (a), coronary calcium and more sophisticated lipid analysis have added little if any additional value to the conventional risk factors of smoking, diabetes and hypertension.

==Angina==
[[Angina pectoris|Angina]] (chest pain) that occurs regularly with activity, after heavy meals, or at other predictable times is termed stable angina and is associated with high grade [[stenosis|narrowings]] of the [[heart]] [[artery|arteries]].  The symptoms of angina are often treated with betablocker therapy such as metoprolol or atenolol.  Nitrate preparations such as [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]], which come in short-acting and long-acting forms are also effective in relieving symptoms but are not known to reduce the chances of future heart attacks. Many other more effective treatments, especially of the underlying [[atheroma]]tous disease, have been developed.

Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction, and requires urgent medical attention. It may be treated with oxygen, intravenous nitroglycerin, and aspirin. Interventional procedures such as [[angioplasty]] may be done.

== Characteristics of coronary artery disease ==

=== Special pathophysiology ===
Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and swollen with all sorts of "grunge" - including calcium deposits, fatty deposits, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] - to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Deposits of calcium phosphates (hydroxyapatites) in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play not only a significant role in stiffening arteries but also for the induction of an early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]].  This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of calcification as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis  (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these patients suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large "pimples" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. Patients with coronary artery disease might have just one or two [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s, or might have dozens distributed throughout their [[coronary arteries]]. However, there is a term in medicine called ''“'''Cardiac Syndrome X'''”'', which describes chest pain ([[Angina pectoris]]) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger [[coronary arteries]] of their hearts when an [[angiogram]] (coronary angiogram) is being performed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lanza GA |title=Cardiac syndrome X: a critical overview and future perspectives |journal=Heart |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=16399854 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.067330 |url= |pmc=1861371}}</ref>

No one knows exactly what causes “Cardiac Syndrome X” and it is unlikely to have a single cause. Today, we speculate that the major contributing factor to “Cardiac Syndrome X” is ''“'''microvascular dysfunction'''”''.{{Who|date=March 2009}} The term “microvascular” refers to very small blood vessels and, in this case, very small [[arteries]] ([[arterioles]], [[capillaries]]) of the [[heart]]. Studies have also shown that people with “Cardiac Syndrome X” have enhanced [[pain]] perception, meaning they feel chest pain more intensely than the average person.

The large majority of women have the garden variety of coronary artery disease.  Rarely, women with “Cardiac Syndrome X” have typical anginal syndromes that are not associated with the presence of atherosclerotic plaques; that is, the localized blockages are absent. Scientists speculate that the blood vessels in these women are diffuse abnormal. Some have falsely claim that the entire lining of the [[artery]] becomes thickened throughout, making the [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s flush with the wall of the [[artery]] without any scientific proof.  On [[cardiac catheterization]] their [[coronary arteries]] appear smooth-walled and normal, though they may look "small" in diameter. By the way: in general, female [[coronary arteries]] (like all arteries) are somewhat smaller than in males.[[Image:Coro Man.jpg|thumb|Coronary angiogram of a man]][[Image:Coro Woman.jpg|thumb|Coronary angiogram of a woman]]

“Cardiac Syndrome X” have never been shown to cause acute heart attacks ([[myocardial infarction]]) despite much speculation. The prognosis with syndrome-X coronary artery disease is also known to be better than with typical coronary artery disease, but this is not a benign condition since it can be quite disabling.
It is not completely clear why women are more likely than men to suffer from "Syndrome X"; however, [[hormone]]s and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaski JC |title=Pathophysiology and management of patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms (cardiac syndrome X) |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=568–72 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14769677 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000116601.58103.62 |url=}}</ref> Women’s blood vessels are exposed to changing levels of [[estrogen]] throughout their lives, first during regular menstrual cycles and later during and after [[menopause]] as [[estrogen]] levels decline with age. [[estrogen]] affects how blood vessels narrow and widen and how they respond to injury, so changes in [[estrogen]] levels mean changes in the reactivity of the blood vessels. Women’s vessels may be “programmed” for more changes than men’s vessels, which could increase the risk of having problems in the lining of the [[arteries]] ([[endothelial cells]]) and the [[smooth muscle]] cells in the walls of the arteries.
The endothelial dysfunction is likely to be multifactorial in these patients and it is conceivable that risk factors such as [[hypertension]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[diabetes mellitus]] and smoking can contribute to its development. Most patients with Syndrome X are postmenopausal women and [[estrogen]] deficiency has been therefore proposed as a pathogenic factor in female patients. In addition to changing hormone levels, there are several other risk conditions for blood vessel problems that are unique to women, such as [[preeclampsia]] (a problem associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy) and delivering a low-birth weight baby.  Of course, despite these issues women, the female gender as a whole is protective against coronary artery disease.

=== Symptoms ===
Cardiac Syndrome X often is a diagnosis of exclusion where the presence of '''typical''' chest pains is not accompanied by coronary artery narrowings on angiography. In considering Syndrome-X, it is important to understand that about 80% of chest pains have nothing to do with the heart.  Therefore, the characteristics of typical chest pains must be carefully documented to avoid unnecessary labelling patients with heart disease:

* Chest pain or [[Angina pectoris]] with physical stress; the [[pain]] may spread to the left arm or the neck, back, throat, or jaw. There might be present a numbness ([[paresthesia]]) or a loss of feeling in the arms, shoulders, or wrists
* [[Coronary angiography]] demonstrates “normal” coronary arteries, i.e. no blockages or stenoses can be detected in the larger [[epicardial]] vessels
* No inducible coronary artery [[spasm]] present during [[cardiac catheterization]]
* Characteristic [[ischemic]] [[ECG]] changes during exercise testing
* [[ST segment]] depression and angina in the presence of left ventricular wall perfusion abnormalities during thallium or other stress perfusion test
* Consistent response to sublingual [[nitrate]]s.
* Postmenopausal or [[Menopause|menopausal]] status

The diagnosis of “Cardiac Syndrome X” - the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, an “exclusion” diagnosis. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any patient with the suspicion of coronary artery disease:
* [[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]] [[electrocardiography]] (ECG)
* Exercise ECG – [[Cardiac stress test|Stress test]]
* Exercise radioisotope test (nuclear stress test, myocardial [[scintigraphy]])
* [[Echocardiography]] (including stress echocardiography)
* [[Coronary angiography]]
* [[Intravascular ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)

===Therapy===
A variety of drugs are used in the attempt to treat the Syndrome-X coronary artery disease: [[nitrate]]s, [[calcium channel antagonist]]s, [[ACE-inhibitor]]s, [[statin]]s, [[imipramine]] (for [[analgesia]]), [[aminophylline]], hormone replacement therapy ([[estrogen]]), even electrical [[spinal cord stimulation]] are tried to overcome the symptomatology -all with mixed results. Quite often the quality of life for these women remains poor.

While not enough is known about Syndrome-X coronary artery disease to list specific [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] techniques, adopting heart-healthy habits can be a good start.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} These include monitoring [[cholesterol]] and [[blood pressure]] levels{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, maintaining a low-fat [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, exercising regularly{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, quitting smoking, avoiding recreational drugs{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, and moderating alcohol intake.

'''Risk factors can be classified as'''
#Fixed: age, sex, family history
#Modifiable: smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc.

There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is ''Framingham Score'', used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.<ref>[http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk/coronary.html framinghamheartstudy.org > Coronary Heart Disease (10-year risk)] (based on Wilson, D'Agostino, Levy et al. 'Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease using Risk Factor Categories', Circulation 1998)</ref>

== Prevention ==
Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease in the Western world. Prevention centers on the modifiable risk factors, which include decreasing [[cholesterol]] levels, addressing [[obesity]] and [[hypertension]], avoiding a [[sedentary lifestyle]], making healthy dietary choices, and [[smoking cessation|stopping smoking]]. There is some evidence that lowering [[homocysteine]] levels may contribute to more heart attacks (NORVIT trial). In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is little evidence that very tight [[blood sugar]] control actually improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other undesirable problems like kidney failure and blindness. Some recommend a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and [[vitamin C]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends "low to moderate alcohol intake" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease although this remains without scientific cause and effect proof.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html |title=5. Population nutrient intake goals for preventing diet-related chronic diseases |publisher=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref>

An increasingly growing number of other [[physiological]] markers and [[homeostatic]] mechanisms are currently under scientific investigation.  Patients with CAD and those trying to prevent CAD are advised to avoid fats that are readily oxidized (e.g., trans-fats), limit carbohydrates and processed sugars to reduce production of [[Low density lipoprotein]]s (LDLs), [[triacylglycerol]] and apolipoprotein-B.<ref name="pmid18384705">{{cite journal |author=Swarbrick MM, Stanhope KL, Elliott SS |title=Consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages for 10 weeks increases postprandial triacylglycerol and apolipoprotein-B concentrations in overweight and obese women |journal=Br.

It is also important to keep [[blood pressure]] normal, exercise and stop smoking.  These measures reduce the development of heart attacks.  Recent studies have shown that dramatic reduction in LDL levels can cause regression of coronary artery disease in as many as 2/3 of patients after just one year of sustained treatment.

CAD has always been a tough disease to diagnose without the use of invasive or stressful activities.  The development of the [[Multifunction cardiogram|Multifunction Cardiogram (MCG)]] has changed the way CAD is diagnosed.  The MCG consists of a 2 lead resting EKG signal is transformed into a mathematical model and compared against tens of thousands of clinical trials to diagnose a patient with an objective severity score, as well as secondary and tertiary results about the patients condition.  The results from MCG tests have been validated in 8 clinical trials which resulted in a database of over 50,000 patients where the system has demonstrated accuracy comparable to [[coronary angiography]] (90% overall sensitivity, 85% specificity).
This level of accuracy comes from the application of advanced techniques in signal processing and systems analysis combined with a large scale clinical database which allows MCG to provide quantitative, evidence-based results to assist physicians in reaching a diagnosis.  The MCG has also been awarded a Category III CPT code by the [[American Medical Association]] in the July 2009 CPT update.

==Exercise==
In patients with coronary artery disease, aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of mortality. Moreover, exercise is associated with lowering blood lipids and inflammatory markers, including [[C-reactive protein]] and [[fibrinogen]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Swardfager W, Herrmann N, Cornish S, Mazereeuw G, Marzolini S, Sham L, Lanctôt KL |title=Exercise intervention and inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis |journal=Am Heart J |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=666–676 |year=2012 |pmid= 22520533 |url= http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(11)00899-4/fulltext }}</ref> which have been associated with risk of mortality and poorer prognoses. Separate to the question of the benefits of exercise; it is unclear whether doctors should spend time counseling patients to exercise.

Regarding healthy women, the more recent [[Women's Health Study]] [[randomized controlled trial]] found [[statistical significance|insignificant]] benefit from aspirin in the reduction of cardiac events; however there was a [[statistical significance|significant]] reduction in [[stroke]].<ref name="pmid15753114">{{cite journal |author=Ridker P, Cook N, Lee I, Gordon D, Gaziano J, Manson J, Hennekens C, Buring J |title=A randomized trial of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=13 |pages=1293–304 |year=2005 |pmid=15753114 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/352/13/1293 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa050613}}</ref> [[Subgroup analysis]] showed that all benefit was confined to women over 65 years old.<ref name="pmid15753114" /> In spite of the [[statistical significance|insignificant]] benefit for women <65 years old, recent [[Clinical practice guideline|practice guidelines]] by the [[American Heart Association]] recommend to 'consider' aspirin in 'healthy women' <65 years of age 'when benefit for ischemic stroke prevention is likely to outweigh adverse effects of therapy'.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mosca L, Banka CL, Benjamin EJ |title=Evidence-based guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in women: 2007 update |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=11 |pages=1481–501 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17309915 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.181546 |url=}}</ref>

== Omega-3 fatty acids ==
The benefit of fish oil is controversial with conflicting conclusions reached by a negative [[meta-analysis]] on studies using traditional omega-3 products<ref name="pmid16565093">{{cite journal |author=Hooper L, Thompson RL, Harrison RA, Summerbell CD, Ness AR, Moore HJ, Worthington HV, Durrington PN, Higgins JP, Capps NE, Riemersma RA, Ebrahim SB, Davey Smith G |title=Risks and benefits of omega 3 fats for mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer: systematic review |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7544 |pages=752–60 |year=2006 |pmid=16565093 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38755.366331.2F |pmc=1420708}}</ref> of [[randomized controlled trials]] by the international [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and a partially positive [[systematic review]]<ref name="pmid16825676">{{cite journal |author=Wang C, Harris WS, Chung M, Lichtenstein AH, Balk EM, Kupelnick B, Jordan HS, Lau J |title=n-3 Fatty acids from fish or fish-oil supplements, but not alpha-linolenic acid, benefit cardiovascular disease outcomes in primary- and secondary-prevention studies: a systematic review |journal=Am.

[[Omega 3|Omega-3]] fatty acids are also found in some plant sources including [[flax seed oil]], [[hemp seed oil]], and [[walnut]]s. The parent Omega-3 [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|ALA]], while very important for general health, needs to be converted in the liver to EPA and only 5% is converted, making the benefits unclear for coronary artery disease specifically.

== Secondary prevention ==
Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Regarding coronary artery disease, this can mean risk factor management that is carried out during cardiac rehabilitation, a 4-phase process beginning in hospital after MI, angioplasty or heart surgery and continuing for a minimum of three months. Exercise is a main component of cardiac rehabilitation along with diet, smoking cessation, and blood pressure and cholesterol management. Beta blockers may also be used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book |last=Awtry |first=Eric H. |coauthors=Joseph Loscalzo |title=Cecil Essentials of Medicine |pages=87–108 |chapter=Coronary Heart Disease |year=2004 |edition=6 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-7216-0147-2}}</ref>

===Anti-platelet therapy===
A [[meta-analysis]] of [[randomized controlled trials]] by the international [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found "that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin is associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events compared with aspirin alone in patients with acute non-ST coronary syndrome. In patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease but not presenting acutely, there is only weak evidence of benefit and hazards of treatment almost match any benefit obtained.".<ref name="pmid17636787">{{cite journal |author=Keller T, Squizzato A, Middeldorp S |title=Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular disease |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD005158 |year=2007 |pmid=17636787 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005158.pub2 |editor1-last=Squizzato |editor1-first=Alessandro}}</ref>

*1. Medical treatment - drugs (e.g. cholesterol lowering medications, beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, calcium antagonists, etc.);
*2. Coronary interventions as [[angioplasty]] and [[coronary stent]]-implantation;
*3. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG - [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]).
Recent research efforts focus on new angiogenic treatment modalities ([[angiogenesis]]) and various (adult) [[stem cell]] therapies.
