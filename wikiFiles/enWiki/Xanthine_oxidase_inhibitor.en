A '''xanthine oxidase inhibitor''' is any substance that [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] the activity of [[xanthine oxidase]], an [[enzyme]] involved in [[purine metabolism]].  In [[human]]s, inhibition of xanthine oxidase reduces the production of [[uric acid]], and several [[medication]]s that inhibit xanthine oxidase are [[Indication (medicine)|indicated]] for treatment of [[hyperuricemia]] and related medical conditions including [[gout]].<ref name="pmid16507884">{{cite journal | author = Pacher P, Nivorozhkin A, Szabó C | title = Therapeutic Effects of Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors: Renaissance Half a Century after the Discovery of Allopurinol | journal = Pharmacol.

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are of two kinds: [[purine analogue]]s and others.  Purine analogues include [[allopurinol]], [[oxypurinol]],<ref name="pmid16135657">{{cite journal |author=Iwanaga T, Kobayashi D, Hirayama M, Maeda T, Tamai I |title=Involvement of uric acid transporter in increased renal clearance of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol induced by a uricosuric agent, benzbromarone |journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1791–5 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16135657 |doi=10.1124/dmd.105.006056 |url=http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16135657

In experiments, numerous [[natural product]]s have been found to inhibit xanthine oxidase [[in vitro]] or in model animals ([[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s).  These include three [[flavonoid]]s that occur in many different fruits and vegetables:  [[kaempferol]], [[myricetin]], and [[quercetin]].<ref name="pmid11673865">{{cite journal
