'''Toxicology testing''', also known as '''safety testing''', or '''toxicity testing''', is conducted to determine the degree to which a substance can damage a living or non-living organisms.   It is often conducted by researchers to comply with governing regulations.  Some toxicology testing is [[chemical test]]ing while some others use animals in the laboratory studies.  Contract animal testing facilities such as [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] and Inveresk Research International conduct a variety of tests on behalf of customers, including the manufacturer of medicines and household products.<ref>http://www.buav.org/pdf/HouseholdProductTests.pdf</ref>

==History==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

===Europe===
Around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests.<ref name=Abbott>Abbott, Alison. [http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf "Animal testing: More than a cosmetic change"] ''Nature'' 438, 144-146, November 10, 2005.</ref> In the UK, one-fifth of animal experiments are toxicology tests.<ref name=Lords3>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report], House of Lords, Chapter 3: The purpose and nature of animal experiments.</ref>

==Methodology==
The tests are conducted without [[anesthesia]], since drugs can change test results.{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=Watkins JB |title=Exposure of rats to inhalational anesthetics alters the hepatobiliary clearance of cholephilic xenobiotics |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=250 |issue=2 |pages=421–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2760837}}</ref> The tests examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[food additives]] such as [[artificial sweetener]]s, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients.  The substances are applied to the skin or eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or placing them in the animals' food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.

==Contract research organizations==

At one time, [[Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories]] conducted more than one-third of toxicology testing in the [[United States]].<ref name='Schneider 1983-04-03'>{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Schneider | title = Science; Lab Fraud - or Government Harrassment | date = 1983-04-03 | work = The Boston Globe }}</ref><ref name='Carson 2007'>{{cite book | last1 = Carson | first1 = Phillip A. | last2 = Dent | first2 = N. | title = Good Clinical, Laboratory and Manufacturing Practices | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | date = 2007-06-01 | pages = 172–174 | isbn = 978-0854048342}}</ref><ref name='JDC essay'>{{cite web | url = http://www.westgard.com/guest16.htm | title = Good Laboratory Practice versus CLIA | accessdate = 2012-07-12 | last = Cook | first = Janine Denis | work = University of Maryland, Baltimore}}</ref>

==Regulation==
===United States===
In the United States, toxicology tests are subject to [[Good Laboratory Practice]] guidelines and other [[Food and Drug Administration]] laws.
