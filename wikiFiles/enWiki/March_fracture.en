'''March fracture''', also known as '''fatigue fracture''' or '''stress fracture of metatarsal bone''', is the [[fracture]] of the distal third of one of the [[metatarsals]] occurring because of recurrent stress.  It is more common in [[soldier]]s, but also occurs in hikers, organists, and even those, like hospital doctors, whose duties entail much standing.  March fractures most commonly occur in the [[second metatarsal|second]] and [[third metatarsal]] bones of the foot.<ref>Hamilton Bailey's Demonstrations of Physical Signs in Clinical Surgery ISBN 0 7506 0625 8{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}</ref><ref name=patient.co.uk>{{cite web|title=Metatarsal Fractures|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Metatarsal-Fractures.htm|publisher=www.patient.co.uk|accessdate=16/10/2011}}</ref> <ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last=Collier et al|first=Judith|title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialities|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-922888-1|pages=694}}</ref> It is a common cause of foot pain, especially when people suddenly increase their activities.<ref>http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/lowerfx/g/march.htm</ref>

== Occurrence ==

[[Stress fractures]] can occur at many sites in the body; "march fracture" simply refers to a stress fracture specifically of the metatarsals, so named because the injury is sometimes sustained by soldiers during sustained periods of marching.<ref name=patient.co.uk /> Although march fractures can occur to the 5th metatarsal, fractures of this bone are more likely to be trauma-related fractures to the [[diaphysis]], termed [[Jones fracture]]s. In runners, march fracture occurs most often in the metatarsal neck, while in dancers it occurs in the proximal shaft. In ballet dancers, fracture mostly occurs at the base of the [[second metatarsal]] and at [[Lisfranc joint]]s. This fracture always occurs following a prolonged stress or weight bearing, and the history of direct trauma is very rare. Consideration should always be given to [[osteoporosis]] and [[osteomalacia]]. Cavus feet are a risk factor for march fracture.<ref>http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx</ref>

== Clinical features ==

The onset is undramatic.  When the boot or [[shoes]] are taken off, there is a cramp-like pain in the affected forefoot, and moderate local [[edema]] appears on the dorsal aspect.  On moving each toe in turn, that of the involved metatarsal causes pain, and when the bone is palpated from the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface, a point of [[tenderness (medicine)|tenderness]] is found directly over the lesion. [[Radiography]] at this stage is negative, but the condition is diagnosed correctly by military [[surgeon]]s without the aid of [[x-ray]]s. In civil life, it is seldom diagnosed correctly for a week or two, when, because of lack of immobilization, there is an excessive deposit of [[callus]] (which may be palpable) around the fracture.<ref>Hamilton Bailey's Demonstrations of Physical Signs in Clinical Surgery ISBN 0 7506 0625 8{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}</ref>

== Diagnostic studies ==

[[X-ray]] is seldom helpful, but a [[CT scan]] and an [[MRI]] study may help in diagnosis.<ref>Emergency Orthopedics:  The Extremities By Robert Rutha Simon and Steven Koenigsknecht ISBN 0838522106{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}</ref>
Bone scans are positive early on. [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] is also helpful to rule out comorbid osteoporosis.<ref>http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx</ref>

== Differential diagnosis ==

* Acute metatarsal fracture
* [[Hallux rigidus]]
* [[Jones fracture]]
* [[Sesamoid]] stress fracture
* Acute sesamoid fracture
* Proximal fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/85746-diagnosis</ref>

== Treatment ==

The first line treatment should be reduction of movements for 6 to 12 weeks. Wooden-soled shoes or a cast should be given for this purpose. In rare cases in which stress fracture occurs with a cavus foot, [[plantar fascia]] release may be appropriate.<ref>http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx</ref>
