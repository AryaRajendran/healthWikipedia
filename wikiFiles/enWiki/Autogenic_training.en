'''Autogenic training''' is a [[relaxation technique]] developed by the [[Germany|German]] psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]] and first published in 1932. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]]. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures (for example, lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll).  The technique can be used to alleviate many [[stress (medicine)|stress]]-induced [[psychosomatic]] disorders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Schultz emphasized parallels to techniques in [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].  It is a method for influencing one's [[autonomic nervous system]]. [[Abbe Faria]] and [[Emile Coue]] are the forerunners of Schultz.  There are many parallels to [[progressive relaxation]]. In 1963 Luthe discovered the significance of "autogenic discharges", paroxysmic phenomena of motor, sensorial, visual and emotional nature related to the traumatic history of the patient, and developed the method of "Autogenic Abreaction". His disciple Luis de Rivera, a McGill trained psychiatrist, introduced psychodynamic concepts<ref>Rivera, JLGde:.Autogenic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. In: "The body in Psychotherapy", pp. 176-181. Editor: J. Guimón. Karger, Basilea, 1997.</ref> into Luthe's approach, developing "Autogenic Analysis"<ref>[http://www.psicoter.es/_arts/pdf/01_A166_01.pdf Rivera, JLGde: Autogenic Análisis: The tool Freud was looking for. International J. Psychotherapy, 2001, 6: 67-76]</ref> as a new method for uncovering the unconscious.

Herbert Benson, MD, a Harvard professor also did significant research in the area.  He called it the Relaxation Response and wrote an influential book with that same title.

==Example of an autogenic training session==
# Sit in the meditative posture and scan the body
# "my right arm is heavy"
# "my arms and legs are heavy and warm" (repeat 3 or more times)
# "my heartbeat is calm and regular" (repeat 3 times)
# "my solar plexus is warm" (repeat 3 times)
# "my forehead is cool"
# "my neck and shoulders are heavy" (repeat 3 times)
# "I am at peace" (repeat 3 times)
# Finish part one by Cancelling
# Start part two by repeating from step 2 to Cancelling
# Start part three by repeating from step 2 to Cancelling

When you end your practice it is a good idea to Cancel to avoid your thoughts from inadvertently materializing. To Cancel say "arms firm" and move your arms vigorously, say "breathe deeply" and breathe deeply, and say "open eyes" and at open your eyes.<ref>Welz, Karl Hans (1991) Autogenic Training -- A Practical Guide in Six Easy Steps http://www.autoaura.com/autogenic.html</ref> 

Many practitioners will choose not to cancel between the three iterations, in order to maintain deeper relaxation.

Quite often, one will ease themselves into the "trance" by counting to ten, and exit by counting backwards from ten. This is another practice taken from progressive relaxation.

An entire autogenic protocol is available [http://www.johnmccauleyphd.com/Autogenic-Training.html here].

==Effects of autogenic training==
Autogenic Training restores the balance between the activity of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] (flight or fight) and the [[parasympathetic]] (rest and digest) branches of the [[autonomic nervous system]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This has important health benefits, as the parasympathetic activity promotes [[digestion]] and bowel movements, lowers the [[blood pressure]], slows the [[heart rate]], and promotes the functions of the [[immune system]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Contraindications==
Autogenic Training is contraindicated for people with heart conditions or psychotic disorders.<ref>Rosa K. R. (1976) Autogenic training. London: Victor Gollancz.</ref>

==Clinical evidence==
Autogenic training has been subject to clinical evaluation from its early days in Germany, and from the early 1980s worldwide.  In 2002, a [[meta-analysis]] of 60 studies was published in ''Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stetter F, Kupper S |title=Autogenic training: a meta-analysis of clinical outcome studies |journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=45–98 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=12001885 |doi=10.1023/A:1014576505223}}</ref> finding significant positive effects of treatment when compared to normals over a number of diagnoses; finding these effects to be similar to best recommended rival therapies; and finding positive additional effects by patients, such as their perceived quality of life.

In Japan, four researchers from the Tokyo Psychology and Counseling Service Center have formulated a measure for reporting clinical effectiveness of autogenic training.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ikezuki M, Miyauchi Y, Yamaguchi H, Koshikawa F |title=[Development of Autogenic Training Clinical Effectiveness Scale (ATCES)] |language=Japanese |journal=Shinrigaku Kenkyu |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=475–81 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11977841 |doi=10.4992/jjpsy.72.475}}</ref>

Autogenic training was popularized in North America particularly among practitioners by Wolfgang Luthe, who co-authored, with Schultz, a multi-volume tome on Autogenic Training. Luthe was a firm believer that Autogenic training was a powerful approach that should only be offered to patients by qualified professionals.

Like many techniques ([[progressive relaxation]], [[yoga]], [[qigong]],<ref name=Cohen>{{cite book|last= Cohen |first=K. S. | year=1999|month=|date= |title= The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healing |publisher= Random House of Canada |isbn=0-345-42109-4}}</ref> varieties of [[meditation]]) which have been developed into advanced, sophisticated processes of intervention and learning, Autogenic training, as Luthe and Schultz wrote in their master tome, took well over a year to learn to teach and over a year to learn. But some [[biofeedback]] practitioners took the most basic elements of autogenic imagery and developed "condensed" simplified versions that were used in combination with biofeedback. This was done at the Menninger foundation by Elmer Green, Steve Fahrio, Patricia Norris, Joe Sargent, Dale Walters and others, where they took the hand warming imagery of Autogenic training and used it as an aid to develop thermal biofeedback.

L'entraînement autogénico est une technique de relaxation basée l'autosugestión. A été développé par le neurologue berlinés Johannes Heinrich Schultz, celui qui l'a présentée le 30 avril 1927 pour la première fois et qui a publié en 1932 son livre "l'Entraînement Autogénico". De nos jours, l'entraînement autogénico est une méthode largement utilisée pour combattre des problèmes psychosomatiques et d'effort. Les exercices sont KKK. L'entraînement autogénico est habituellement appris dans des cours de groupes et une plus petite fréquemment dans des cours individuels d'une paire de semaines. Mais les gens peuvent aussi l'apprendre par son compte propre. Il y a divers livres (principalement en allemand) qui viennent fréquemment accompagnés d'un ruban ou d'un CD. La prise pratiquante au début de l'entraînement une position confortable. Ceux qu'il est entamé font avec davantage de facilité par s'ils sont couchés, mais en principe peut être prise toute position dans laquelle un peut détendre dans sa totalité les muscles. Les exercices comprennent des processus de répéter plusieurs fois visions sur un état souhaité au moyen de formules vu. La personne essaye d'être imaginées de la manière la plus intense possible ces visions. Le retour appelé, un "réveiller" artificiel avec des mouvements d'estiramiento pour activer les arrêts nerveux, finit les exercices. -->
