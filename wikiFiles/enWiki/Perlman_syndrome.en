'''Perlman syndrome''' (PS) (also called '''renal hamartomas''', '''nephroblastomatosis''' and '''fetal gigantism''') is a rare [[overgrowth syndrome|overgrowth disorder]] present at birth. It is characterized by [[polyhydramnios]] and fetal overgrowth, including [[macrocephaly]], neonatal [[macrosomia]], [[visceromegaly]], [[dysmorphic]] facial features, and an increased risk for [[Wilms' tumor]] at an early age. The prognosis for Perlman syndrome is poor and it is associated with a high [[neonatal mortality]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Perlman syndrome is an uncommon [[genetic disorder]] grouped with overgrowth syndrome in which an abnormal increase is often noted at birth in the size of the body or a body part of the infant. The disorder, also called renal hamartomas, nephroblastomatosis and fetal gigantism, has also been grouped with [[Renal cell carcinoma]].<ref name='orphanet' /> The characteristic features include [[polyhydramnios]], fetal overgrowth, including [[macrocephaly]], neonatal [[macrosomia]], visceromegaly, [[dysmorphic]] facial features, and an increased risk for [[Wilms' tumor]] at an early age.<ref name="pmid3024486">{{cite journal |author=Perlman M |title=Perlman syndrome: familial renal dysplasia with Wilms tumor, fetal gigantism, and multiple congenital anomalies. |journal=Am J Med Genet. |volume=25 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=793–5 |year=1986 |month=December |pmid=3024486 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320250418}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Perlman syndrome is a [[rare disease]] with an estimated incidence of less than 1 in 1,000,000. As of 2008, less than 30 patients had ever been reported in the world literature.<ref name='orphanet'>{{cite web | url = http://www.orpha.net//consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=2849 | title = Perlman syndrome | accessdate = 2010-10-21 | date = 2008-05 | publisher = Orphanet}}</ref>

== Genetics ==
[[File:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|Perlman syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]
The gene thought to cause some of the cases of Perlman syndrome is DIS3L2 found on chromosome 2 at 2q37.2 and is thought to have an important role in the mitotic cell cycle. Although both sexes are affected, the sex ratio of male to female is 2:1. The syndrome has been described in both [[consanguineous]] and non-consanguineous couplings.<ref name='Piccione'>{{cite journal | title = Perlman syndrome (renal hamartomas, nephroblastomatosis and fetal gigantism) | journal = Atlas Genet Cytogenet Oncol Haematol | date = 2006-12 | first = Maria | last = Piccione | coauthors = Giovanni Corsello  | url = http://AtlasGeneticsOncology.org/Kprones/PerlmanID10117.html | accessdate = 2010-10-18}}</ref>
No chromosomal abnormalities have been observed, except for in the case of Chernos et al., which showed a ''de novo'' mutation — an extra G positive band, a [[genetic mutation]] that neither parent possessed nor transmitted — on the tip of the short arm of [[chromosome 11 (human)|chromosome 11]].<ref name="pmc1683946">{{cite journal |author=Chernos JE, Fowler SB, Cox DM |title=A case of Perlman syndrome associated with a cytogenetic abnormality of chromosome 11 (abstract) |journal=Am J Hum Genet. |volume=47(suppl) |pages=A28 |year=1990 |month=September |pmc=1683946}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The [[diagnosis]] of Perlman syndrome is based on observed phenotypic features and confirmed by [[histological]] examination of the kidneys. [[Prenatal diagnosis]] is possible for families that have a genetic disposition for Perlman syndrome although there is no conclusive laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis. Fetal overgrowth, particularly with an [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (OFC) greater than the 90th centile for [[gestational age]], as well as an excess of [[amniotic fluid]] in the [[amniotic sac]] (polyhydramnios), may be the first signs of Perlman.<ref name='Piccione' /> Using ultrasound diagnosis, Perlman syndrome has been detected at 18 weeks. During the [[first trimester]], the common abnormalities of the syndrome observed by ultrasound include [[cystic hygroma]] and a thickened [[nuchal lucency]]. Common findings for the second and third trimesters include macrosomia, enlarged kidneys, renal tumors (both hamartoma and Wilms), cardiac abnormalities and visceromegaly.<ref name=Benacerraf2007 >{{citation | last=Benacerraf | first=Beryl R. | year=2007 | title=Ultrasound of fetal syndromes | edition=2 | publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn=978-0-443-06641-2  | page=147 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1MHFF0UOKAUC }}</ref>

Prompt recognition and identification of the disorder along with accurate follow-up and clinical assistance is recommended as the prognosis for Perlman is severe and associated with a high neonatal death rate.<ref name='Piccione' /><ref name='Emery' />

==Differential diagnosis==
Perlman syndrome shares clinical overlaps with other overgrowth disorders with similarities to [[Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome]] and [[Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome]] having been particularly emphasized in scientific study. Similarities with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, include polyhydramnios, macrosomia, nephromegaly and hypoglycaemia. It is the distinctive facial [[dysmorphology]] of Perlman, including deep-set eyes, depressed [[nasal bridge]], everted upper lip, and macrocephaly which allows the two conditions to be distinguished from one another. Diagnosis of Perlman syndrome also overlap with other disorders associated with Wilms tumor namely [[Sotos syndrome]] and [[Weaver syndrome]].<ref name='Piccione' /><ref name='Emery' >{{citation | title=Emery and Rimoin's principles and practice of medical genetics, Volume 2 | publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn=978-0-443-06870-6  | page=1522 | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=uc9fmqARPf8C }}</ref>
