'''Diabetes mellitus''', or simply '''diabetes''', is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high [[blood sugar]], either because the [[pancreas]] does not produce enough [[insulin]], or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced.<ref name=Green2011>{{cite book|last=Shoback|first=edited by David G. Gardner, Dolores|title=Greenspan's basic & clinical endocrinology|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0-07-162243-8|pages=Chapter 17|edition=9th}}</ref> This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of [[polyuria]] (frequent urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst) and [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger).

There are three main types of diabetes mellitus (DM). 
*[[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type&nbsp;1 DM]] results from the body's failure to produce insulin, and currently requires the person to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump. This form was previously referred to as "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" (IDDM) or "juvenile diabetes".
*[[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type&nbsp;2 DM]] results from [[insulin resistance]], a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. This form was previously referred to as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or "adult-onset diabetes".
*The third main form, [[gestational diabetes]] occurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. It may precede development of type&nbsp;2 DM.

Other forms of diabetes mellitus include congenital diabetes, which is due to [[Genetics|genetic]] defects of insulin secretion, [[cystic fibrosis]]-related diabetes, steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of [[MODY|monogenic diabetes]].

Untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. [[Acute (medical)|Acute]] complications include [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] and [[nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]]. Serious long-term complications include [[cardiovascular disease]], [[chronic renal failure]], and [[diabetic retinopathy]] (retinal damage). Adequate treatment of diabetes is thus important, as well as [[blood pressure]] control and lifestyle factors such as stopping [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and maintaining a healthy [[human weight|body weight]].

All forms of diabetes have been treatable since [[insulin]] became available in 1921, and type&nbsp;2 diabetes may be controlled with medications. Insulin and some oral medications can cause [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugars), which can be dangerous if severe. Both types 1 and 2 are [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] conditions that cannot be cured.  [[Pancreas transplant]]s have been tried with limited success in type&nbsp;1 DM; [[gastric bypass surgery]] has been successful in many with [[morbid obesity]] and type&nbsp;2 DM.  Gestational diabetes usually resolves after delivery.

Diabetes mellitus is classified into four broad categories: [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type&nbsp;1]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&nbsp;2]], [[gestational diabetes]] and "other specific types".<ref name=Green2011/> The "other specific types" are a collection of a few dozen individual causes.<ref name=Green2011/> The term "diabetes", without qualification, usually refers to diabetes mellitus.  The rare disease [[diabetes insipidus]] has similar symptoms as diabetes mellitus, but without disturbances in the sugar metabolism (''insipidus'' means "without taste" in Latin) and does not involve the same disease mechanisms.

The term "type&nbsp;1 diabetes" has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Likewise, the term "type&nbsp;2 diabetes" has replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard nomenclature.

===Type 1 diabetes===
{{Main|Diabetes mellitus type 1}}
Type&nbsp;1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing [[beta cell]]s of the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency. This type can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. The majority of type&nbsp;1 diabetes is of the immune-mediated nature, in which beta cell loss is a [[T-cell]]-mediated [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] attack.<ref name="Rother">{{cite journal | author = Rother KI | title = Diabetes treatment—bridging the divide | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 356 | issue = 15 | pages = 1499–501 | year = 2007 | month = April | pmid = 17429082 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp078030 }}</ref> There is no known preventive measure against type&nbsp;1 diabetes, which causes approximately 10% of diabetes mellitus cases in North America and Europe. Most affected people are otherwise healthy and of a healthy weight when onset occurs. Sensitivity and responsiveness to insulin are usually normal, especially in the early stages. Type&nbsp;1 diabetes can affect children or adults, but was traditionally termed "juvenile diabetes" because a majority of these diabetes cases were in children.

"Brittle" diabetes, also known as unstable diabetes or labile diabetes, is a term that was traditionally used to describe to dramatic and recurrent swings in [[glucose]] levels, often occurring for no apparent reason in [[insulin]]-dependent diabetes. This term, however, has no biologic basis and should not be used.<ref name="merck1">{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec12/ch158/ch158b.html#sec12-ch158-ch158b-1206 |title=Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=[[Merck & Co.|Merck Publishing]] |month= April | year = 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> There are many reasons for type&nbsp;1 diabetes to be accompanied by irregular and unpredictable [[hyperglycemia]]s, frequently with [[ketosis]], and sometimes serious [[hypoglycemia]]s, including an impaired counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, occult infection, gastroparesis (which leads to erratic absorption of dietary carbohydrates), and endocrinopathies (e.g., Addison's disease).<ref name="merck1"/> These phenomena are believed to occur no more frequently than in 1% to 2% of persons with type&nbsp;1 diabetes.<ref name="pmid406527">{{cite journal | author = Dorner M, Pinget M, Brogard JM | title = Essential labile diabetes | language = German | journal = MMW Munch Med Wochenschr | volume = 119 | issue = 19 | pages = 671–4 | year = 1977 | month = May | pmid = 406527 | doi =  }}</ref>

===Type 2 diabetes===
{{Main|Diabetes mellitus type 2}}
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by [[insulin resistance]], which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion.<ref name=Green2011/> The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the [[insulin receptor]]. However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is the most common type.

In the early stage of type&nbsp;2, the predominant abnormality is reduced insulin sensitivity. At this stage, hyperglycemia can be reversed by a variety of measures and [[Anti-diabetic drug|medications]] that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production by the [[liver]].

===Gestational diabetes===
{{Main|Gestational diabetes}}

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) resembles type&nbsp;2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2%–5% of all [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] and may improve or disappear after delivery. Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. About 20%–50% of affected women develop type&nbsp;2 diabetes later in life.

Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include [[macrosomia]] (high birth weight), congenital cardiac and central nervous system anomalies, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased fetal insulin may inhibit fetal [[surfactant]] production and cause [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]]. [[Hyperbilirubinemia]] may result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. [[Labor induction]] may be indicated with decreased placental function. A [[Caesarean section]] may be performed if there is marked fetal distress or an increased risk of injury associated with [[macrosomia]], such as [[shoulder dystocia]].

A 2008 study completed in the U.S. found the number of American women entering pregnancy with pre-existing diabetes is increasing. In fact, the rate of diabetes in expectant mothers has more than doubled in the past six years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lawrence JM, Contreras R, Chen W, Sacks DA | title = Trends in the prevalence of preexisting diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus among a racially/ethnically diverse population of pregnant women, 1999–2005 | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 899–904 | year = 2008 | month = May | pmid = 18223030 | doi = 10.2337/dc07-2345 }}</ref> This is particularly problematic as diabetes raises the risk of complications during pregnancy, as well as increasing the potential for the children of diabetic mothers to become diabetic in the future.

===Other types===
[[Prediabetes]] indicates a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type&nbsp;2 DM.
Many people destined to develop type&nbsp;2 DM spend many years in a state of prediabetes which has been termed "America's largest healthcare epidemic."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Handelsman Y, MD  | title = A Doctor's Diagnosis: Prediabetes | journal = Power of Prevention | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages =  | year =  | pmid =  | doi =  }}</ref>{{Rp|10–11|date=July 2009}}

[[Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults]] (LADA) is a condition in which type&nbsp;1 DM develops in adults. Adults with LADA are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type&nbsp;2 DM, based on age rather than [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]].

Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type&nbsp;2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon. Genetic mutations ([[Autosomal dominant|autosomal]] or [[mitochondrial]]) can lead to defects in [[beta cell]] function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the [[pancreas]] may lead to diabetes (for example, [[chronic pancreatitis]] and [[cystic fibrosis]]). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of [[insulin receptor|insulin-antagonistic]] [[hormone]]s can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells. The [[ICD]]-10 (1992) diagnostic entity, ''malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus'' (MRDM or MMDM, ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by the [[World Health Organization]] when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999.<ref name="WHO1999-DefDiagClass">{{cite web|publisher=[[World Health Organisation]] |title=Definition, Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and its Complications|year=1999|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Main symptoms of diabetes.png|thumb|300px|Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes]]

The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are loss of weight, [[polyuria]] (frequent urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst) and [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cooke DW, Plotnick L | title = Type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics | journal = Pediatr Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 11 | pages = 374–84; quiz 385 | year = 2008 | month = November | pmid = 18977856 | doi = 10.1542/pir.29-11-374 }}</ref> Symptoms may develop rapidly (weeks or months) in type&nbsp;1 diabetes, while they usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type&nbsp;2 diabetes.

Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the lens of the eye, which leads to changes in its shape, resulting in vision changes. Blurred vision is a common complaint leading to a diabetes diagnosis. A number of skin rashes that can occur in diabetes are collectively known as [[diabetic dermadromes]].

===Diabetic emergencies===
People (usually with type&nbsp;1 diabetes) may also present with [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by the smell of [[acetone]], a rapid, deep breathing known as [[Kussmaul breathing]], nausea, vomiting and [[abdominal pain]], and altered states of consciousness.

A rare but equally severe possibility is [[Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma|hyperosmolar nonketotic state]], which is more common in type&nbsp;2 diabetes and is mainly the result of dehydration.

===Complications===
{{Main|Complications of diabetes mellitus}}

All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications. These typically develop after many years (10–20), but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time. The major long-term complications relate to damage to [[blood vessel]]s. Diabetes doubles the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration | title = Diabetes mellitus, fasting blood glucose concentration, and risk of vascular disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of 102 prospective studies | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2215–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609967 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60484-9 | pmc = 2904878 }}</ref> The main [[Macrovascular disease|"macrovascular" diseases]] (related to [[atherosclerosis]] of larger arteries) are [[ischemic heart disease]] ([[angina]] and [[myocardial infarction]]), [[stroke]] and [[peripheral vascular disease]].

Diabetes also damages the [[capillaries]] (causes [[microangiopathy]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Boussageon R, Bejan-Angoulvant T, Saadatian-Elahi M, Lafont S, Bergeonneau C, Kassaï B, Erpeldinger S, Wright JM, Gueyffier F, Cornu C | title = Effect of intensive glucose lowering treatment on all cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and microvascular events in type&nbsp;2 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 343 | issue =  | pages = d4169 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21791495 | pmc = 3144314 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d4169 }}</ref> [[Diabetic retinopathy]], which affects blood vessel formation in the [[retina]] of the eye, can lead to visual symptoms including reduced vision and potentially [[blindness]]. [[Diabetic nephropathy]], the impact of diabetes on the kidneys, can lead to [[glomerulosclerosis|scarring changes in the kidney tissue]], loss of [[Microalbuminuria|small]] or progressively [[Proteinuria|larger]] amounts of protein in the urine, and eventually [[chronic kidney disease]] requiring [[dialysis]].

Another risk is [[diabetic neuropathy]], the impact of diabetes on the [[peripheral nervous system|nervous system]] &mdash; most commonly causing numbness, tingling and pain in the feet, and also increasing the risk of skin damage due to altered sensation. Together with vascular disease in the legs, neuropathy contributes to the risk of [[diabetic foot|diabetes-related foot problems]] (such as [[diabetic foot ulcer]]s) that can be difficult to treat and occasionally require [[amputation]].  As well, [[proximal diabetic neuropathy]] causes painful [[muscle wasting]] and weakness.

Several studies suggest<ref name=cognitive>{{cite web |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-005-0023-4/fulltext.html |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Cognitive decline and dementia in diabetes—systematic overview of prospective observational studies |date=8 Nov 2005 |accessdate=28 Apr 2013 |author=Cukierman, T}}</ref> a link between [[cognitive deficit]] and diabetes.  Compared to those without diabetes, the research showed that those with the disease have a 1.2 to 1.5-fold greater rate of decline in cognitive function, and are at greater risk.

==Causes==
The cause of diabetes depends on the type.

Type&nbsp;1 diabetes is partly inherited, and then triggered by certain infections, with some evidence pointing at [[Coxsackie B4 virus]]. A genetic element in individual susceptibility to some of these triggers has been traced to particular [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] [[genotype]]s (i.e., the genetic "self" identifiers relied upon by the immune system). However, even in those who have inherited the susceptibility, type&nbsp;1 DM seems to require an environmental trigger.  The onset of type&nbsp;1 diabetes is unrelated to lifestyle.

Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics.<ref name=Fat2009>{{cite journal | author = Risérus U, [[Walter Willett|Willet W]] | title = Dietary fats and prevention of type 2 diabetes | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–51 | year = 2009 | month = January | pmid = 19032965 | pmc = 2654180 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2008.10.002 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
[[File:Suckale08 fig3 glucose insulin day.png|thumb|The fluctuation of blood sugar (red) and the sugar-lowering hormone [[insulin]] (blue) in humans during the course of a day with three meals - one of the effects of a [[sucrose|sugar]]-rich vs a [[starch]]-rich meal is highlighted.]]
[[File:Glucose-insulin-release.png|thumb|Mechanism of insulin release in normal pancreatic beta cells - insulin production is more or less constant within the beta cells. Its release is triggered by food, chiefly food containing absorbable glucose.]]
Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates uptake of [[glucose]] from the blood into most cells (primarily muscle and fat cells, but not central nervous system cells). Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] plays a central role in all forms of diabetes mellitus.

Humans are capable of digesting some [[Carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrates]], in particular those most common in food; starch, and some disaccharides such as sucrose, are converted within a few hours to simpler forms, most notably the [[monosaccharide]] [[glucose]], the principal carbohydrate energy source used by the body. The rest are passed on for processing by gut flora largely in the colon. Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage.

Insulin is also the principal control signal for conversion of glucose to [[glycogen]] for internal storage in liver and muscle cells. Lowered glucose levels result both in the reduced release of insulin from the β-cells and in the reverse conversion of glycogen to glucose when glucose levels fall. This is mainly controlled by the hormone [[glucagon]], which acts in the opposite manner to insulin. Glucose thus forcibly produced from internal liver cell stores (as glycogen) re-enters the bloodstream; muscle cells lack the necessary export mechanism. Normally, liver cells do this when the level of insulin is low (which normally correlates with low levels of blood glucose).

Higher insulin levels increase some [[anabolism|anabolic]] ("building up") processes, such as cell growth and duplication, [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], and [[lipid|fat]] storage. Insulin (or its lack) is the principal signal in converting many of the bidirectional processes of metabolism from a [[catabolism|catabolic]] to an anabolic direction, and ''vice versa''. In particular, a low insulin level is the trigger for entering or leaving ketosis (the fat-burning metabolic phase).

If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin (insulin insensitivity or resistance), or if the insulin itself is defective, then glucose will not have its usual effect, so it will not be absorbed properly by those body cells that require it, nor will it be stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistent high levels of blood glucose, poor protein synthesis, and other metabolic derangements, such as [[acidosis]].

When the glucose concentration in the blood is raised to about 9-10&nbsp;mmol/L (except certain conditions, such as pregnancy), beyond its [[renal threshold]] (i.e. when glucose level surpasses the [[transport maximum]] of glucose reabsorption), [[reabsorption]] of glucose in the [[proximal tubule|proximal renal tubuli]] is incomplete, and part of the glucose remains in the [[urine]] ([[glycosuria]]). This increases the [[osmotic pressure]] of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production ([[polyuria]]) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments, causing [[dehydration]] and increased thirst.

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Glycated hemoglobin|Glucose tolerance test}}
{{OGTT}}
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following:<ref name="WHO1999-DefDiagClass" />

* Fasting plasma glucose level ≥&nbsp;7.0&nbsp;mmol/l (126&nbsp;mg/dl)
* [[Plasma glucose]] ≥&nbsp;11.1&nbsp;mmol/l (200&nbsp;mg/dL) two hours after a 75&nbsp;g oral glucose load as in a [[glucose tolerance test]]
* Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose ≥&nbsp;11.1&nbsp;mmol/l (200&nbsp;mg/dl)
* [[Glycated hemoglobin]] (Hb A1C) ≥&nbsp;6.5%.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[American Diabetes Association]]|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/Supplement_1/S3.full|title="Diabetes Care" January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref>

A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Saydah SH, Miret M, Sung J, Varas C, Gause D, Brancati FL | title = Postchallenge hyperglycemia and mortality in a national sample of U.S. adults | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1397–402 | year = 2001 | month = August | pmid = 11473076 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.24.8.1397 }}</ref> According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126&nbsp;mg/dl (7.0&nbsp;mmol/l) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.

==Management==
{{Main|Diabetes management}}
Diabetes mellitus is a [[chronic disease]], for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations.  Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ("euglycemia") as possible, without causing hypoglycemia.  This can usually be accomplished with diet, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type&nbsp;1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type&nbsp;2 diabetes).

Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital, since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nathan DM, Cleary PA, Backlund JY, Genuth SM, Lachin JM, Orchard TJ, Raskin P, Zinman B; Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group | title = Intensive diabetes treatment and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 353 | issue = 25 | pages = 2643–53 | year = 2005 | month = December | pmid = 16371630 | pmc = 2637991 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa052187 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = <Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.> | title = The effect of intensive diabetes therapy on the development and progression of neuropathy.

There are roles for patient education, dietetic support, sensible exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|within acceptable bounds]].  In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adler AI, Stratton IM, Neil HA, Yudkin JS, Matthews DR, Cull CA, Wright AD, Turner RC, Holman RR | title = Association of systolic blood pressure with macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 36): prospective observational study | journal = BMJ | volume = 321 | issue = 7258 | pages = 412–9 | year = 2000 | month = August | pmid = 10938049 | pmc = 27455 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.321.7258.412 }}</ref>

;Insulin
{{Main|Insulin therapy}}
Type&nbsp;1 diabetes is typically treated with a combinations of regular and NPH [[insulin]], or synthetic [[insulin analogs]]. When insulin is used in type&nbsp;2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.<ref name=AFP09/> Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.<ref name=AFP09/>

===Support===
In countries using a [[general practitioner]] system, such as the [[United Kingdom]], care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care of a patient in a team approach. Home [[telehealth]] support can be an effective management technique.<ref name="Polisena">{{cite journal | author = Polisena J, Tran K, Cimon K, Hutton B, McGill S, Palmer K | title = Home telehealth for diabetes management: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Diabetes Obes Metab | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 913–30 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19531058 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01057.x }}</ref>

Globally, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, an estimated 285&nbsp;million people had diabetes, with type&nbsp;2 making up about 90% of the cases.<ref name=Will2011/> Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and by 2030, this number is estimated to almost double.<ref name="Wild2004" /> Diabetes mellitus occurs throughout the world, but is more common (especially type&nbsp;2) in the more developed countries. The greatest increase in prevalence is, however, expected to occur in Asia and Africa, where most patients will probably be found by 2030.<ref name="Wild2004" /> The increase in incidence in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, perhaps most importantly a "Western-style" diet.

Galen named the disease "diarrhea of the urine" (diarrhea urinosa). The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that of [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] (2nd or early 3rd century CE). He described the symptoms and the course of the disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of  the "Pneumatic School". He hypothesized a correlation of diabetes with other diseases and he discussed differential diagnosis from the snakebite which also provokes excessive thirst. His work remained unknown in the West until the middle of the 16th century when, in 1552, the first Latin edition was published in Venice.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Konstantinos Laios ''et al.'' | year = 2012 | title = Aretaeus of Cappadocia and the first description of diabetes | url = | journal = Hormones | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 109–113 }}</ref>

Type&nbsp;1 and type&nbsp;2 diabetes where identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400-500&nbsp;CE with type&nbsp;1 associated with youth and type&nbsp;2 with being overweight.<ref name=History2010/> The term "mellitus" or "from honey" was added by the Briton John Rolle in the late 1700s to separate the condition from [[diabetes insipidus]], which is also associated with frequent urination.<ref name=History2010/> Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century, when Canadians [[Frederick Banting]] and [[Charles Herbert Best]] isolated and purified insulin in 1921 and 1922.<ref name=History2010/> This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the 1940s.<ref name=History2010/>

==In other animals==
{{main|Diabetes in dogs|Diabetes in cats}}

In animals, diabetes is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as [[Poodle|Miniature Poodles]].<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | title=Diabetes mellitus | work=Merck Veterinary Manual, 9th edition (online version) | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/40302.htm | year=2005 | accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognised in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.<ref name=Merck/>
