[[File:Haploid vs diploid.svg|thumb|120px|Diploid cells have two [[Homologous chromosome|homologous]] copies of each [[chromosome]].]]

'''Ploidy''' is the number of sets of [[chromosomes]] in the [[nucleus (biology)|nucleus]] of a [[biological cell]]. Normally a [[gamete]] ([[sperm]] or [[ovum|egg]]) carries a full set of chromosomes that includes a single copy of each [[gene]], as [[aneuploidy]] generally leads to severe genetic disease in the offspring. The '''haploid number''' (n) is the number of chromosomes in a gamete. Two gametes form a '''diploid''' [[zygote]] with twice this number (2n) i.e. two copies of [[autosomal]] chromosomes. However, the [[sex chromosomes]] of diploid cells (excluding [[pseudoautosomal region]]s), which are subject to [[sex linkage]], may be considered as haploid chromosomes.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.le.ac.uk/ge/maj4/project.html|author=Mark A. Jobling|title=The Y chromosome as a marker for the history and structure of human populations}}</ref>

Technically, ploidy is a description of a nucleus. Though at times authors may report the total ploidy of all nuclei present within the cell membrane of a [[syncytium]],<ref name=D~Amato>Encyclopedia of the Life Sciences (2002) "Polyploidy" Francesco D’Amato and Mauro Durante<!--- Sorry, omitted URL over stupid copyright issues---></ref> usually the ploidy of the nuclei present will be described. For example, a fungal [[dikaryon]] with two haploid nuclei is distinguished from the diploid in which the chromosomes share a nucleus and can be shuffled together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~anders38/ms.pdf|title=Dikaryons, diploids, and evolution|author=James B. Anderson and Linda M Kohn|publisher=University of Toronto}}</ref> Nonetheless, because in most situations there is only one nucleus, it is commonplace to speak of the ploidy of a cell.

Cells are described according to the number of sets present: '''haploid''' (1 set), '''diploid''' (2 sets), '''triploid''' (3 sets), '''tetraploid''' (4 sets), pentaploid (5 sets), hexaploid (6 sets), heptaploid<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00119108?LI=true|title=Morphology of pachytene chromosomes and its bearing on the nature of polyploidy in the cytological races of Apluda mutica L.|author=U.

Because chromosome number is generally reduced only by the specialized process of [[meiosis]], the [[somatic cells]] of the body inherit and maintain the diploid chromosome number of the zygote. However, in many situations somatic cells double their copy number by means of [[endoreduplication]] as an aspect of [[cellular differentiation]]. For example, the hearts of two-year-old children contain 85% diploid and 15% tetraploid nuclei, but by 12 years of age the proportions become approximately equal, and adults examined contained 27% diploid, 71% tetraploid and 2% octaploid nuclei.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VhLOSt1bq-wC&pg=PA234|title=The Development and Regenerative Potential of Cardiac Muscle|author=John O. Oberpriller, A Mauro|publisher=Taylor&Francis}}</ref>

It is also possible on rare occasions for the ploidy to increase in the [[germline]], which can result in [[polyploid]] ''organisms'' and ultimately polyploid ''species''. This is an important evolutionary mechanism in both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_940/07Polyploidy/papers/Mable2004.pdf|title="‘Why polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants’: myths and mechanisms" in ''Biological relevance of polyploidy: ecology to genomics''|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|year=2004|volume=82|pages=453–466}}</ref> As a result, it becomes desirable to distinguish between the ploidy of a species or variety as it presently breeds and that of an ancestor. The number of chromosomes in the ancestral (non-homologous) set is called the '''monoploid number''' (x), and is distinct from the haploid number (n) in the organism as it now reproduces. Both numbers n, and x, apply to every cell of a given organism. 

For humans, a diploid species x&nbsp;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;23. A typical human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes: 2 complete haploid sets, which make up 23 [[homologous chromosome]] pairs. But [[Common wheat]] is an organism where x and n differ. It has six sets of chromosomes, two sets from each of three different diploid species that are its distant ancestors. The somatic cells are hexaploid, with six sets of chromosomes, 2n&nbsp;=&nbsp;6x&nbsp;=&nbsp;42. The gametes are haploid for their own species, but triploid, with three sets of chromosomes, by comparison to a probable evolutionary ancestor, [[einkorn wheat]]. The monoploid number x&nbsp;=&nbsp;7, and the haploid number n&nbsp;=&nbsp;21. Tetraploidy (four sets of chromosomes, 2n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4x) is common in [[plant]]s, and also occurs in [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[insect]]s.

Over evolutionary time scales in which [[chromosomal polymorphism]]s accumulate, these changes become less apparent by [[karyotype]] - for example, humans are generally regarded as diploid, but the [[2R hypothesis]] has confirmed two rounds of whole genome duplication in early vertebrate ancestors.

Ploidy can also differ with life cycle and caste. In humans, only the gametes are haploid, but in the Australian bulldog ant, ''[[Myrmecia pilosula]]'', a [[haplodiploid]] species, haploid individuals of this species have a single chromosome, and diploid individuals have two chromosomes.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.231.4743.1278}}</ref> [[Alternation of generations]] occurs in many plants.

'''Euploidy''' is the state of a cell or organism having an integral multiple of the monoploid number, possibly excluding the [[sex chromosome|sex-determining chromosomes]]. For example, a human cell has 46 chromosomes, which is an [[integer]] multiple of the monoploid number, 23. A human with abnormal, but integral, multiples of this full set (e.g. 69 chromosomes) would also be considered as euploid. '''[[Aneuploidy]]''' is the state of not having euploidy. In humans, examples include having a single extra chromosome (such as [[Down syndrome]]), or missing a chromosome (such as [[Turner syndrome]]). Aneuploid [[karyotype]]s are given names with the suffix ''-somy'' (rather than ''-ploidy'', used for euploid karyotypes), such as [[trisomy]] and [[monosomy]].

== Etymology ==
The term ''ploidy'' is a [[back-formation]] from ''haploid'' and ''diploid''. These two terms are from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἁπλόος ''haplóos'' "single" and διπλόος ''diplóos'' "double" combined with εἶδος ''eîdos'' "form" (compare ''idol'' from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''īdōlum'', that from Greek εἴδωλον ''eídōlon'' derived from εἶδος ''eîdos''). The two ''haploid'' and ''diploid'' terms were borrowed from German through [[William Henry Lang]]'s 1908 translation of a 1894 textbook by [[Eduard Strasburger]] and colleagues.<ref>Strasburger, E.; Noll, F.; Schenck, H.; Karsten, G. 1908. ''A Textbook of botany'', a translation by W. H. Lang of ''Lehrbuch der Botanik für Hochschulen''. Macmillan, London.</ref> Strasburger used diploid to refer to an organism with twice the number of chromosomes of a haploid organism, hence "double" and "single".

== Haploid and monoploid ==
The '''haploid number''' (''n'') is the number of chromosomes in a [[gamete]] of an individual. This is distinct from the monoploid number (''x''), which is the number of unique chromosomes in a single complete set. Gametes ([[sperm]], and [[ovum|ova]]) are haploid cells. The haploid gametes produced by (most) diploid organisms combine to form a diploid [[zygote]]. For example, most animals are diploid and produce monoploid haploid gametes.

During [[meiosis]], sex cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly "choosing" one homologue, resulting in haploid gametes. Because homologous chromosomes usually differ genetically, gametes usually differ genetically from one another.

All [[plant]]s and many fungi and algae switch between a haploid and a diploid state (which may be [[polyploid]]), with one of the stages emphasized over the other. This is called [[alternation of generations]]. Most [[fungus|fungi]] and [[alga]]e are haploid during the principal stage of their lifecycle.

[[Male]] [[bees]], [[wasps]], and [[ants]] are haploid organisms because of the way they develop from unfertilized, haploid [[egg cells]]. 

In humans, the monoploid number (''x'') equals the haploid number (''n''), ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;23, but, in some species (especially plants), these numbers differ. [[Common wheat]] has six sets of chromosomes in its [[somatic]] cells, derived from its three different ancestral species, for a total of 42 chromosomes. The gametes of common wheat are considered to be haploid, since they contain half the genetic information of somatic cells (thus common wheat has a haploid number 'n' of 21) but are not monoploid, as they still contain three complete sets of chromosomes (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3''x''). As the monoploid number of an organism is the number of chromosomes in each complete set, and common wheat has 6 complete sets of chromosomes, the monoploid number of common wheat is 7 (6 sets X 7 chromosomes = 42 total chromosomes).<ref>http://mcb.berkeley.edu/courses/mcb142/lecture%20topics/Amacher/LECTURE_10_CHROM_F08.pdf</ref>

== Diploid ==
'''Diploid''' (indicated by 2''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''x'') cells have two [[Homologous chromosome|homologous]] copies of each [[chromosome]], usually one from the [[mother]] and one from the [[father]]. Nearly all mammals are diploid organisms. The tetraploid (four sets) [[plains viscacha rat]]s ''[[Tympanoctomys barrerae]]'' and ''[[Pipanacoctomys aureus]]''.<ref name=Gallardo2006>{{cite journal | author = Gallardo, M.H. | year = 2006 | title = Molecular cytogenetics and allotetraploidy in the red vizcacha rat, ''Tympanoctomys barrerae'' (Rodentia, Octodontidae)] | journal = Genomics | volume =88 | issue = 2 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WG1-4JKYTJP-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a18e9e7ecd4f6082c8579d751043661d | pages = 214–221 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.02.010 | pmid=16580173}}</ref> are the only known exceptions as of 2004<ref>Gallardo, M. H. ''et al.'' (2004). Whole-genome duplications in South American desert rodents (Octodontidae). ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 82'', 443-451.</ref>), although all individuals have some small fraction of cells that display [[polyploidy]]. Human diploid cells have 46 chromosomes and human haploid [[gametes]] (egg and sperm) have 23 chromosomes.
[[Retrovirus]]es that contain two copies of their RNA genome in each viral particle are also said to be diploid. Examples include [[human foamy virus]], [[human T-lymphotropic virus]], and [[HIV]].<ref>http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/mmi/jmoodie/hiv2.html</ref>

== Homoploid ==
"Homoploid" means "at the same ploidy level", i.e. having the same number of homologous chromosomes. For example, homoploid [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] is hybridization where the offspring have the same ploidy level as the two parental species. This contrasts with a common situation in plants where chromosome doubling accompanies, or happens soon after hybridization. Similarly, homoploid speciation contrasts with [[polyploid speciation]].

==Zygoidy and azygoidy==
Zygoidy is the state where the chromosomes are paired and can undergo meiosis. The zygoid state of a species may be diploid or polyploid.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-12-017603-8| last = Books| first = Elsevier Science & Technology| title = Advances in Genetics| date = 1950-01-01}}</ref><ref name=Cosin2011>Cosín, Darío J. Díaz, Marta Novo, and Rosa Fernández. “Reproduction of Earthworms: Sexual Selection and Parthenogenesis.” In Biology of Earthworms, edited by Ayten Karaca, 24:69-86. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. http://www.springerlink.com/content/j5j72p2834355w27/.</ref> In the azygoid state the chromosomes are unpaired. It may be the natural state of some asexual species or may occur after meiosis. In diploid organisms the azygoid state is monoploid. (see below for dihaploidy)

== Polyploidy ==
{{main|Polyploidy}}

'''Polyploidy''' is the state where all cells have multiple sets of chromosomes beyond the basic set. For example, in triploids 2''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3''x'', and in tetraploids 2''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4''x''. The chromosome sets may be from the same species or from closely related species. In the latter case, these are known as allopolyploids (or amphidiploids, which are allopolyploids that behave as if they were normal diploids). Allopolyploids are formed from the hybridization of two separate species. In plants, this probably most often occurs from the pairing of meiotically unreduced [[gametes]], and not by diploid–diploid hybridization followed by chromosome doubling.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150437}}</ref> The so-called [[Triangle of U|Brassica triangle]] is an example of allopolyploidy, where three different parent species have hybridized in all possible pair combinations to produce three new species.

Polyploidy occurs commonly in plants, but rarely in animals. Even in diploid organisms, many [[somatic cell]]s are polyploid due to a process called [[endoreduplication]] where duplication of the [[genome]] occurs without [[mitosis]] (cell division).

The extreme in polyploidy occurs in the [[fern]] genus ''[[Ophioglossum]]'', the adder's-tongues, in which polyploidy results in chromosome counts in the hundreds, or, in at least one case, well over one thousand.

It is also possible for polyploid organisms to revert to lower ploidy by means of [[haploidisation]].

== Variable or indefinite ploidy ==
Depending on growth conditions, [[prokaryotes]] such as bacteria may have a chromosome copy number of 1 to 4, and that number is commonly fractional, counting portions of the chromosome partly replicated at a given time. This is because under exponential growth conditions the cells are able to replicate their DNA faster than they can divide.

==Mixoploidy==
Mixoploidy refers to the presence of two cell lines, one diploid and one polyploid. Though polyploidy in humans is not viable, mixoploidy has been found in live adults and children. There are two types: diploid-triploid mixoploidy, in which some cells have 46 chromosomes and some have 69, and diploid-tetraploid mixoploidy, in which some cells have 46 and some have 92 chromosomes.

== Dihaploidy and polyhaploidy ==
{{distinguish2|[[Haplodiploid sex-determination system|haplodiploidy]] (where diploid and haploid individuals are different sexes)}}
Dihaploid and polyhaploid cells are formed by [[haploidisation]] of polyploids, i.e., by halving the chromosome constitution.

Dihaploids (which are diploid) are important for selective breeding of tetraploid crop plants (notably potatoes), because selection is faster with diploids than with tetraploids. Tetraploids can be reconstituted from the diploids, for example by somatic fusion.

The term “dihaploid” was coined by Bender<ref>Bender, K. 1963. “Über die Erzeugung und Entstehung dihaploider Pflanzen bei ''Solanum tuberosum''”. ''Zeitschrift für Pflanzenzüchtung'' 50: 141–166.</ref> to combine in one word the number of genome copies (diploid) and their origin (haploid). The term is well established in this original sense,<ref>Nogler, G.A. 1984. Gametophytic apomixis. In ''Embryology of angiosperms''. Edited by B.M. Johri. Springer, Berlin, Germany. pp. 475–518.</ref><ref>* Pehu, E. 1996. The current status of knowledge on the cellular biology of potato. ''Potato Research'' 39: 429–435.</ref> but it has also been used for doubled monoploids or [[doubled haploidy|doubled haploids]], which are homozygous and used for genetic research.<ref>* Sprague, G.F., Russell, W.A., and Penny, L.H. 1960. Mutations affecting quantitative traits in the selfed progeny of double monoploid maize stocks. ''Genetics'' 45(7): 855–866.</ref>

== Possible adaptive and ecological significance of variation in ploidy ==
A study comparing the [[karyotypes]] of endangered or invasive plants with those of their relatives found that being polyploid as opposed to diploid is associated with a 14% lower risk of being endangered, and a 20% greater chance of being invasive.<ref name = "Pandit">{{Cite journal
