'''Preventive medicine''' or '''preventive care''' consists of measures taken to prevent diseases,<ref>{{MeshName|Preventive+Medicine}}</ref> (or injuries) rather than [[curative care|curing]] them or [[palliative care|treating]] their symptoms. This contrasts in method with [[curative care|curative]] and [[palliative care|palliative]] medicine, and in scope with [[public health]] methods (which work at the level of population health rather than individual health). [[Occupational medicine]] operates very often within the preventive medicine.

==Levels==
Preventive medicine strategies are typically described as taking place at the primary, secondary, tertiary and [[Quaternary prevention|quaternary]] prevention levels. In addition, the term primal prevention has been used to describe all measures taken to ensure fetal well-being and prevent any long-term health consequences from gestational history and/or disease.<ref>Primal Research Centre, London</ref> The rationale for such efforts is the evidence demonstrating the link between fetal well-being, or "primal health," and adult health.<ref>Primal Health Research Databank</ref><ref>Effect of In Utero and Early-Life Conditions on Adult Health and Disease, by P.D.Gluckman et al., N ENGL J MED 359;1</ref> Primal prevention strategies typically focus on providing future parents with: education regarding the consequences of [[epigenetic]] influences on their child,<ref>Origins: How the nine months before birth shape the rest of your life, by Annie Murphy Paul, Time magazine, 176.14, 2010</ref> sufficient leave time for both parents or, for lack of it, at least some kin caregiving. 

Simple examples of preventive medicine include [[hand washing]], [[breastfeeding]], and [[immunization]]s. Preventive care may include examinations and screening tests tailored to an individual's age, health, and family history. For example, a person with a family history of certain cancers or other diseases would begin screening at an earlier age and/or more frequently than those with no such family history. On the other side of preventive medicine, some nonprofit organizations, such as the [[Northern California Cancer Center]], apply epidemiologic research towards finding ways to prevent diseases.

==Universal, selective, and indicated==

Gordon (1987) in the area of disease prevention,<ref>Gordon, R. (1987), ‘An operational classification of disease prevention’, in Steinberg, J. A. and Silverman, M. M. (eds.), Preventing Mental Disorders, Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1987.</ref> and later Kumpfer and Baxley in the area of substance use<ref>Kumpfer, K. L., and Baxley, G. B. (1997), 'Drug abuse prevention: What works?', National Institute on Drug Abuse, Rockville.</ref> proposed a three-tiered preventive intervention classification system: universal, selective, and indicated prevention. Amongst others, this typology has gained favour and is used by the U.S. [[Institute of Medicine]], the [[NIDA]] and the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]]. 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Tier
!Definition
|-
|Universal prevention
|Involves whole population (nation, local community, school, district) and aims to prevent or delay the abuse of [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]], tobacco, and other [[drug abuse|drugs]]. All individuals, without screening, are provided with information and skills needed to prevent the problem.
|-
|Selective prevention
|Involves groups whose risk of developing problems of alcohol abuse or dependence is above average. Subgroups may be distinguished by traits such as age, gender, family history, or economic status. For example, drug campaigns in recreational settings.
|-
|Indicated prevention
|Involves a screening process, and aims to identify individuals who exhibit early signs of substance abuse and other problem behaviours. Identifiers may include falling grades among students, known problem consumption or [[conduct disorder]]s, alienation from parents, school, and positive peer groups etc.
|}

Outside the scope of this three-tier model is ''environmental prevention''. Environmental prevention approaches are typically managed at the regulatory or community level and focus on ways to deter drug consumption. Prohibition and bans (e.g. on [[smoking ban|smoking]], [[alcohol advertising]]) may be viewed as the ultimate environmental restriction. However, in practice, environmental preventions programs embrace various initiatives at the ''macro'' and ''micro'' level, from government monopolies for alcohol sales through roadside sobriety or drug tests, worker/pupil/student drug testing, increased policing in sensitive settings (near schools, at rock festivals), and legislative guidelines aimed at precipitating punishments (warnings, penalties, fines).

==Professionals==
Professionals involved in the public health aspect of this practice may be involved in [[entomology]], [[pest control]], and public health inspections. Public health inspections can include recreational [[water]]s, [[swimming pool]]s, [[beach]]es, [[food]] preparation and serving, and [[industry|industrial]] [[hygiene]] inspections and surveys.

In the [[United States]], preventive medicine is a [[medical specialty]], and has one of the 24 certifying boards recognized by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) dedicated to it as well as one of the 18 certifying boards recognized by the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS). It encompasses three areas of specialization:
* General preventive medicine and public health
* Aerospace medicine
* Occupational medicine

To become board-certified in one of the preventive medicine areas of specialization, a licensed U.S. physician ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) must successfully complete a preventive medicine [[medical residency]] program following a one-year [[internship]]. Following that, the physician must pass the preventive medicine board examination. The residency program is at least two years in length and includes completion of a  [[master's degree]] in [[public health]] (MPH) or equivalent. The board exam takes a full day: the morning session concentrates on general preventive medicine questions, while the afternoon session concentrates on the one of the three areas of specialization that the applicant has studied.

In addition, there are two subspecialty areas of certification:
* [[Medical toxicology]] (MT)
* Undersea and [[hyperbaric]] medicine (UHB), formerly "undersea medicine"

These certifications require sitting for an examination following successful completion of an MT or UHB fellowship and prior board certification in one of the 24 ABMS-recognized specialties or 18 AOABOS-recognized specialties.

==Prophylaxis==
''Prophylaxis'' ({{lang-el|προφυλάσσω}} ''to guard or prevent beforehand'') is any medical or [[public health]] procedure whose purpose is to prevent, rather than treat or cure a disease. In general terms, prophylactic measures are divided between ''primary'' prophylaxis (to prevent the development of a disease) and ''secondary'' prophylaxis (whereby the disease has already developed and the patient is protected against worsening of this process).<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is Prophylaxis?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-prophylaxis.htm|publisher=wiseGEEK}}</ref>

===Examples===
Some specific examples of prophylaxis include:
*Many [[vaccine]]s are prophylactic, vaccines such as [[polio vaccine]], [[smallpox vaccine]], [[measles vaccine]], [[mumps vaccine]] and others have greatly reduced many childhood diseases; [[HPV vaccine]]s prevent certain cancers; [[influenza vaccine]].<ref>Jamie Michelle Womack (2010) [http://media.jaapa.com/documents/12/vaccines0110_2845.pdf "Safety and adherence: Issues that hinder childhood vaccinations"] ''Journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants''</ref>
*[[Birth control]] methods are used to prevent [[unwanted pregnancy]]. [[Condom]]s, for instance, are sometimes [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] referred to as "prophylactics" because of their use to prevent [[pregnancy]] as well as the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.
*Daily and moderate [[physical exercise]] in various forms can be called prophylactic because it can maintain or improve one's health. [[utility cycling|Cycling for transport]] appears to very significantly improve health by reducing risk of heart diseases, various cancers, muscular- and skeletal diseases, and overall mortality.<ref name=Anderson_2000>{{cite journal |author=Lars Bo Andersen et al. |title=All-cause mortality associated with physical activity during leisure time, work, sports, and cycling to work |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |year=2000 |month=June |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1621–8 |doi=10.1001/archinte.160.11.1621 |pmid=10847255}}</ref>
*Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables each day may be prophylactic. It may reduce the risk of heart disease.<ref>{{cite web|last=United States Department of Agriculture|title=Why is it important to eat fruit?|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/fruits-why.html|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref>
*[[Fluoride therapy]] and [[tooth cleaning]], either at home or by a professional, are parts of dental prophylaxis or oral prophylaxis.<ref>{{cite pmid|11521913|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19723429|noedit}}</ref>
*[[Antibiotic]]s are sometimes used prophylactically: For example, during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] scare in the United States, patients believed to be exposed were given [[ciprofloxacin]]. In similar manner, the use of antibiotic ointments on burns and other wounds is prophylactic. Antibiotics are also given prophylactically just before some medical procedures such as pacemaker insertion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Oliveira JC, Martinelli M, D'Orio Nishioka SA, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to the implantation of pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators: Results of a large, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology |year=2009 |volume=2 |pages=29–34 |doi=10.1161/CIRCEP.108.795906|pmid=19808441 |issue=1}}</ref>
*[[Tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) may, ''with caution'', be an example of a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] migraine preventive (see [[amitriptyline]] and [[migraine#Preventive drugs|migraines' prevention by medicine]]).
*[[antimalarial drug|Antimalarials]] such as [[chloroquine]] and [[mefloquine]] are used both in treatment and as prophylaxis by visitors to countries where [[malaria]] is endemic to prevent the development of the [[parasitic]] ''[[Plasmodium]]'', which cause [[malaria]].
*Mechanical measures (such as [[graduated compression stockings]] or [[intermittent pneumatic compression]]) and drugs (such as [[low-molecular-weight heparin]], unfractionated [[heparin]], and [[fondaparinux]]) may be used in immobilized [[hospital]] patients at risk of [[venous thromboembolism]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1059/0003-4819-155-9-201111010-00011| volume = 155| issue = 9| pages = 625–632| author = Qaseem A, Chou R, Humphrey LL, ''et al''. | title = Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Hospitalized Patients: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine| year = 2011 | url = http://www.annals.org/content/155/9/625.abstract| pmid=22041951}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1059/0003-4819-155-9-201111010-00008| volume = 155| issue = 9| pages = 602–615| author = Lederle FA, Zylla D, MacDonald R, ''et al''. | title = Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Hospitalized Medical Patients and Those With Stroke: A Background Review for an American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | year = 2011 | url = http://www.annals.org/content/155/9/602.abstract| pmid=22041949}}</ref><ref name="Kahn">{{cite journal|author= Kahn SR, Lim W, Dunn AS, ''et al''.|title= Prevention of VTE in Nonsurgical Patients: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines |journal=Chest|volume=141|issue=2 suppl|pages= e195S–e226S|year=2012|month= February|pmid=22315261|doi=10.1378/chest.11-2296}}</ref>
*Risk reducing or prophylactic [[mastectomies]] may be carried out for carriers of the [[BRCA mutation]] gene to minimise the risk of developing [[breast cancer]].
* Early and exclusive [[breastfeeding]] provides immunological protection against infectious diseases and well as reduced risk of chronic diseases for both mother and child.<ref>Ip S, Chung M, Raman G, ChewP, Magula N, DeVine D, Litt M, Trikalinos T, Lau J. Breastfeeding and maternal and infant health outcomes in developed countries. Evidence Report/Technology Assessment Number 153. 2007 April; AHRQ Publication No. 07-E007.</ref>
* [[Polypill]] for prevention of e.g. [[cardiovascular disease]].
* [[Potassium iodide]] is used prophylactically to protect the [[thyroid gland]] from absorbing inhaled or ingested [[radioactive iodine]], which may lead to the development of [[thyroid cancer]]; radioactive iodine may be released into the environment in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant, or the detonation of a nuclear explosive (see [[potassium iodide#Thyroid protection due to nuclear accidents and emergencies|thyroid protection due to nuclear accidents and emergencies]]).
*Prophylaxis may be administered as oral medication. Oral prophylaxis includes: PEP, nPEP, or PrEP. PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis used in an occupational setting e.g., to prevent the spread of HIV or Hepatitis C from patient to staff following an accidental needlestick. nPEP is non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis. nPEP may be used in a sexual or injection exposure to HIV, hepatitis, or other infectious agents; for example, during intercourse, if the condom breaks and one partner is HIV-positive, nPEP will help to decrease the probability that the HIV-negative partner becomes infected with HIV. (An nPEP is sometimes known as a PEPse - i.e. post-exposure prophylaxis sexual encounter.)  PrEP is a measure taken daily (before, during, and after) possible exposure; for example, by a person who inconsistently uses condoms during sex with a partner who may have an HIV infection.

==Limitations==

Since preventive medicine deals with healthy individuals or populations the costs and potential harms from interventions need even more careful examination than in treatment.  For an intervention to be applied widely it generally needs to be affordable and highly cost effective.

For instance, [[intrauterine device]]s (IUD) are highly effective and highly cost effective contraceptives, however where [[universal health care]] is not available the initial cost may be a barrier.<ref name=Speidel>{{cite journal|journal = Contraception | year = 2008 | month = September | title = The Potential of Long-acting Reversible Contraception to Decrease Unintended Pregnancy | author = J. Joseph Speidel, Cynthia C. Harper, and Wayne C. Shields | url = http://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/contraception-journal/september-2008 }}</ref>  IUDs work for several years (3 to 7 or more) and cost less over a year or two's time than most other reversible contraceptive methods.<ref name=Trussell2009>{{cite journal|journal = Contraception|year = 2009| volume=79|issue = 1| pmid=19041435| pages = 5–14| title = Cost effectiveness of contraceptives in the United States | author = James Trussell, Anjana Lalla, Quan Doan, Eileen Reyes, Lionel Pinto, Joseph Gricar|doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2008.08.003}}</ref>  They are also highly cost effective, saving health insurers and the public significant costs in [[unwanted pregnancies]].<ref name=Trussell2009 />  Making contraceptives available with no up front cost is one way to increase usage, improving health and saving money.<ref name=Monea2011>{{cite journal | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | year = 2011 | month = June | volume = 43 | author = Monea J, Thomas A | title = Unintended pregnancy and taxpayer spending | pages = 88–93 | doi = 10.1363/4308811 | issue = 2 | pmid = 21651707}}</ref>

Preventive solutions may be less profitable and therefore less attractive to makers and marketers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Birth control pills which are taken every day and may take in a thousand dollars over ten years may generate more profits than an IUD, which despite a huge initial markup only generates a few hundred dollars over the same period.<ref name=Speidel />
