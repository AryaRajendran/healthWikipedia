The '''Wolf Prize in Medicine''' is awarded once a year by the [[Wolf Foundation]] in [[Israel]]. It is one of the six [[Wolf Prize]]s established by the Foundation and awarded since 1978; the others are in [[Wolf Prize in Agriculture|Agriculture]], [[Wolf Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics|Mathematics]], [[Wolf Prize in Physics|Physics]] and [[Wolf Prize in Arts|Arts]]. The Prize is probably the third most prestigious award in [[medicine]], after the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] and the [[Lasker Award]].
