'''Charles Alan Blake Clemetson''' [[FRCOG]], [[FRCSC]], [[FACOG]] (31 October 1923 – 30 August 2006) was a medical doctor, scientist and researcher who published over 48 medical papers and a three-volume monograph, ''Vitamin C''.<ref name="Vitamin C, Vols I, II, III Monograph">{{cite journal |author= C.A.B. Clemetson |title=Books: Vitamin C, Vols. I, II, III |journal=CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida|year=1989 }}</ref> During his hospital and teaching career he specialised in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]]. After retirement in 1991 he devoted his time to researching and publishing papers on [[scurvy|Barlow's disease]] (scurvy in [[infant]]s), hypothesizing this to be a cause of [[shaken-baby syndrome]].

==Biography==
Clemetson was born in [[Canterbury]], [[England]], attending Wootton Court [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], [[Wootton, Kent|Wootton]], [[Kent]] (1930–1935) and [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]], [[Canterbury]] (1935–1942). After preclinical studies at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[University of Oxford]], he completed his training at [[Radcliffe Infirmary]], graduating from Oxford University in 1948 with a [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery]] (B.M., B.Ch) degree.<ref name=bmjbio>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39245.750637.BE |title=Charles Alan Blake Clemetson |year=2007 |author=Innis, M.; Yazbak, F E. |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |page=1327}}</ref>

He married Helen Cowan Forster, a [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]], on 29 March 1947. They had four children.<ref name=bmjbio/>

After graduation, he became a [[Royal Air Force]] medical officer for two years, and then returned to Oxford University in 1950 for a MA degree. In 1950, as a research assistant in Obstetrics, he started to pursue research into preeclamptic [[Pre-eclampsia|toxaemia]] and started to publish medical papers in 1953. In 1951-1952, he was named a Nichols Research Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]. From 1952 through 1956, he served at various hospitals in England as the House Surgeon of either Obstetrics or Gynecology, and, in 1956, became a lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology at London University.

Clemetson immigrated to [[Saskatoon]], [[Canada]] (1958–1961), becoming an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the [[University of Saskatchewan|University of Saskatoon]]. During this period, he began to be interested in [[vitamin C]] while on an expedition to [[Rankin Inlet]], [[Nunavut]] on [[Hudson Bay]], impressed by the good [[capillary]] strength of the local [[Inuit]], surmising this to be due to raw fish in their diet.<ref name=bmjbio/>

Then, in 1961, he moved to California and assumed a position as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] Medical Center, and a lecturer in the Department of Maternal and Child Health at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

In 1967, he assumed a teaching position (1967–1972) as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology with the [[State University of New York]], Brooklyn. He also became the Director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department (1967–1981) at the Methodist Hospital of [[Brooklyn]], New York. In addition (1972–1981), he served as a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the [[Downstate Medical Center]] of the State University of New York, Brooklyn, New York.

Clemetson moved to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] in 1981, and became a professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at [[Tulane University School of Medicine]], and the Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the [[Huey P. Long Medical Center]], [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], [[Louisiana]]. He also became a consultant in Gynecology for the Department of Surgery, Veterans Administration Hospital, Pineville, Louisiana.

Upon his retirement in 1991 as a Professor Emeritus, [[Tulane University School of Medicine]], Clemetson devoted his remaining years to writing and publishing medical papers concerning [[Shaken baby syndrome]].

Near the end of his life, he narrowly escaped the [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans|New Orleans disaster]] from [[Hurricane Katrina]], having been warned by his carer's [[meteorologist]] brother-in-law. He escaped with the latter over the [[Lake Pontchartrain]] bridge the day before it was destroyed. He lived in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] for nearly a year while his family restored his house, but died of [[heart failure]] a few weeks after this was completed.<ref name=bmjbio/>

==Achievements==
Clemetson had a long and distinguished academic career as a medical doctor, scientist and researcher. During his forty year professional career, he implemented numerous scientific studies and was instrumental in furthering scientific knowledge.
The following listed achievements are highlights of his life’s work that are contained in his extensive Curriculum Vitae.<ref>[http://www.aapsonline.org/clemetson.htm Curriculum Vitae]</ref>

Clemetson's most notable medico-legal achievement was as the father of the "Motherhood Bill", which requires that all medical insurance carriers in the State of New York include coverage for pregnancy and complications of pregnancy. This so-called Donovan Bill rapidly spread to all 50 states.

;University College Hospital – London – 1950-1952 / 1956-1958
*Demonstrated the effects of cord around the neck and of [[pre-eclampsia]] on the oxygen saturation of newborn infants.
*Published the first study of "small-for-dates" infants in his studies of "the difference in birth weight of human twins."
*Demonstrated impaired active transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus in pre-eclampsia.
*Demonstrated aortic hypoplasia in some patients following severe early pre-eclampsia.
*Performed and published successful open cardiac massage outside of hospital.

;University of California Medical Center – San Francisco – 1961–1967
*Bioflavonoids and catechins - Solved the old "Vitamin P" problem, by showing that [[bioflavonoids]] with certain structural characteristics act as indirect antioxidants for Vitamin C. See: Plant Polyphenols Monograph in New York Academy of Sciences.
*Pre-eclampsia - Demonstrated a disturbance of ascorbic acid metabolism in pre-eclampsia and in abruptio placentae.
**Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn – New York – 1967–1981
*Developed a new method for measuring the bilirubin content of [[amniotic fluid]].
*In collaboration with the Department of Anesthesiology, he showed an improved oxygen saturation in the umbilical cord of blood of babies delivered by Caesarean Section under spinal anesthesia when the mother is placed in a left-side-down tilt position.
*In collaboration with Drs. Mallikarjuneswara and Moshfeghi, he was able to measure the electrical charge on fertilized rat ova, and this was the first time that anyone had ever measured the electrical charge on any mammalian [[ovum]].
*He showed conclusively that women on the pill need more Vitamin C than usual, and, as a result of this, a special vitamin formula called “Feminins” was developed and marketed for women on the pill.
*His research on the uterine luminal fluid in the rat showed that estrogen causes secretion and progesterone causes reabsorption of uterine [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] fluid.
*In collaboration with J.K. Kim and others, he showed that the [[luteal]] phase of the human menstrual cycle is the reabsorptive phase, and not the secretory phase.
*In recent research, he has shown that people with low vitamin C levels have very high blood histamine levels.
*He was able to relate the above observation to [[abruptio placentae]], as women with low ascorbate (Vitamin C) and high histamine levels are prone to develop premature separation of the [[placenta]].

;Tulane University School of Medicine 1981–1990
*Wrote three-volume monograph, ''Vitamin C'',<ref name="Vitamin C, Vols I, II, III Monograph"/>

==Medical hypotheses==
In 1964, Clemetson conducted and  published the first studies<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clemetson CA,  Andersen L |title=Ascorbic Acid Metabolism In Preeclampsia |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=24 |issue= |pages=744–82 |year=1964 |month=November |pmid=14227609}}</ref>  concerning [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) metabolism and depletion in [[pre-eclampsia]].

After Clemetson’s retirement from teaching in 1991, his work focused on developing the hypothesis that the [[bleeding|hemorrhages]] seen in infants with [[Shaken baby syndrome]] are caused not by inflicted [[Physical trauma|trauma]], but by [[capillary]] damage due to Barlow's disease (subclinical [[scurvy]]) - a condition called by proponents Clemetson/Kalokerinos syndrome. The mechanism he argued to be high [[histamine]] levels associated with low [[blood plasma|serum]] [[vitamin C]], the latter deficiency arising before birth due to factors such as the pregnant mother's [[malnutrition]], and in the infant by recurrent [[infection]]s and recent multiple [[vaccination]]s.<ref name=bmjbio/>
