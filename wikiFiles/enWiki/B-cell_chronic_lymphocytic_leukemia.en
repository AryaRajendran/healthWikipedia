'''B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia''' ('''B-CLL'''), also known as '''chronic lymphoid leukemia''' (CLL), is the most common type of adulthood [[leukemias]]. Leukemias are cancers of the [[white blood cell]]s (leukocytes). CLL affects [[B cell]] [[lymphocyte]]s. B cells originate in the bone marrow, develop in the lymph nodes, and normally fight infection by producing [[antibodies]].  In CLL, B cells grow out of control and accumulate in the [[bone marrow]] and [[blood]], where they crowd out healthy [[blood cells]].  CLL is a [[cancer staging|stage]] of '''small lymphocytic lymphoma''' (SLL), a type of [[B-cell lymphoma]], which presents primarily in the [[lymph nodes]].<ref name="pmid10577857">{{cite journal |author=Harris NL |title=World Health Organization classification of neoplastic diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues: report of the Clinical Advisory Committee meeting-Airlie House, Virginia, November 1997 |journal=J.

CLL is a disease of adults, but, in rare cases, it can occur in teenagers and occasionally in children (inherited). Most (>75%) people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 50, and the majority are men.

Most people are diagnosed without symptoms as the result of a routine blood test that returns a high white blood cell count, but, as it advances, CLL results in [[swollen lymph nodes]], [[splenomegaly|spleen]], and [[hepatomegaly|liver]], and eventually [[anemia]] and infections. Early CLL is not treated, and late CLL is treated with chemotherapy and [[monoclonal antibodies]].

DNA analysis has distinguished two major types of CLL, with different survival times. CLL that is positive for the marker [[ZAP-70]] has an average survival of 8 years. CLL that is negative for ZAP-70 has an average survival of more than 25 years. Many patients, especially older ones, with slowly progressing disease can be reassured and may not need any treatment in their lifetimes.<ref name="pmid15728813">{{cite journal |author=Chiorazzi N, Rai KR, Ferrarini M |title=Chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=N.

==Symptoms and signs==
Most people are diagnosed without symptoms as the result of a routine blood test that returns a high white blood cell count. Less commonly, CLL may present with enlarged lymph nodes without a high white blood cell count or no evidence of the disease in the blood. This is referred to as ''small lymphocytic lymphoma''. In some individuals the disease comes to light only after the neoplastic cells overwhelm the bone marrow resulting in anemia producing tiredness or weakness.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a [[lymph node]] affected by B-CLL showing a characteristic proliferation center (right of image), composed of larger, lighter staining, cells. [[H&E stain]].]]
CLL is usually first suspected by the presence of a [[lymphocytosis]], an increase in one type of white blood cell, on a complete blood count (CBC) test. This frequently is an incidental finding on a routine physician visit. Most often the lymphocyte count is greater than 4000 cells per microliter (µl) of blood, but can be much higher. The presence of a lymphocytosis in an elderly individual should raise strong suspicion for CLL, and a confirmatory diagnostic test, in particular flow cytometry, should be performed unless clinically unnecessary.

The diagnosis of CLL is based on the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface. This atypical molecular pattern includes the coexpression of cells surface markers [[cluster of differentiation]] [[CD5 (protein)|5]] ([[CD5 (protein)|CD5]]) and [[cluster of differentiation]] [[CD23|23]] ([[CD23]]). In addition, all the CLL cells within one individual are clonal, that is, genetically identical. In practice, this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive [[Immunoglobulin light chain|antibody light chains]], kappa or lambda, on the entire population of the abnormal B cells. Normal B lymphocytes consist of a stew of different antibody-producing cells, resulting in a mixture of both kappa and lambda expressing cells. The lack of the normal distribution of kappa and lambda producing B cells is one basis for demonstrating clonality, the key element for establishing a diagnosis of any B cell malignancy (B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma).

The combination of the microscopic examination of the peripheral blood and analysis of the lymphocytes by [[flow cytometry]] to confirm clonality and marker molecule expression is needed to establish the diagnosis of CLL. Both are easily accomplished on a small amount of blood. A [[flow cytometer]] is an instrument that can examine the expression of molecules on individual cells in fluids. This requires the use of specific antibodies to marker molecules with fluorescent tags recognized by the instrument. In CLL, the lymphocytes are genetically clonal, of the B cell lineage (expressing marker molecules [[cluster of differentiation]] [[CD19|19]] ([[CD19]]) and [[CD20]]), and  characteristically express the marker molecules [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]] and [[CD23]]. These B cells resemble normal lymphocytes under the microscope, although slightly smaller, and are fragile when smeared onto a glass slide, giving rise to many broken cells, which are called smudge, or smear cells.<ref name="isbn1-4051-4265-0">{{cite book |author=Bain, Barbara J. |title=Blood Cells: A Practical Guide |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited |location= |year=2006 |page=439 |isbn=1-4051-4265-0 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

===Clinical staging===

Staging, determining the extent of the disease, is done with the Rai staging system or the Binet classification (see details<ref name="NCI-CLL-page2">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page2 |title=Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (PDQ) Treatment: Stage Information |author=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-09-04 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017143320/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page2| archivedate= 17 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>) and is based primarily on the presence of a low platelet or red cell count. Early stage disease does not need to be treated.

===Gene mutation status===

Since assessment of the IgV<sub>H</sub> antibody DNA changes is difficult to perform, the presence of either [[cluster of differentiation]] [[CD38|38]] ([[CD38]]) or Z-chain–associated protein kinase-70 ([[ZAP-70]]) may be surrogate markers of high risk subtype of CLL.<ref name="pmid16983131"/> Their expression correlates with a more immature cellular state and a more rapid disease course.

===Fluorescence in situ hybridization===

In addition to the maturational state, the prognosis of patients with CLL is dependent on the genetic changes within the neoplastic cell population. These genetic changes can be identified by fluorescent probes to chromosomal parts using a technique referred to as [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH).<ref name="pmid16983131"/> Four main genetic aberrations are recognized in CLL cells that have a major impact on disease behavior.<ref name="pmid11136261">{{cite journal | author = Dohner H|year=2000|title=Genomic aberrations and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=NEJM|volume=343|issue=26|pages=1910–6|pmid=11136261|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/343/26/1910 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200012283432602 | author-separator = , | author2 = Stilgenbauer S | author3 = Benner A | author4 = "" | display-authors = 4 | last5 = Kröber | first5 = Alexander | last6 = Bullinger | first6 = Lars | last7 = Döhner | first7 = Konstanze | last8 = Bentz | first8 = Martin | last9 = Lichter | first9 = Peter}}</ref>
# Deletions of part of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del 17p), which target the cell cycle regulating protein p53 are particularly deleterious. The deletion of p53 leads to deregulation of numerous genes including microRNAs (miR-34a).<ref>{{Cite pmid|19158830}}</ref> Patients with this abnormality have significantly short interval before they require therapy and a shorter survival. This abnormality is found in 5–10% of patients with CLL.
# Deletions of the long arm on chromosome 11 (del 11q) are also unfavorable although not to the degree seen with del 17p. The abnormality targets the ATM gene and occurs infrequently in CLL (5–10%).
# Trisomy 12, an additional chromosome 12, is a relatively frequent finding occurring in 20–25% of patients and imparts an intermediate prognosis.
# Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 (del 13q) is the most common abnormality in CLL with roughly 50% of patients with cells containing this defect. These patients have the best prognosis and most will live many years, even decades, without the need for therapy. The gene targeted by this deletion is a segment coding for microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19347736}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|23216588}}</ref>

===Array-based karyotyping===

Array-based karyotyping is a cost-effective alternative to FISH for detecting chromosomal abnormalities in CLL.

===Related diseases===

In the past, cases with similar microscopic appearance in the blood but with a T cell phenotype were referred to as T-cell CLL. These so-called T-cell CLLs, however,  are now recognized as a separate disease group and are currently classified as [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aid=2149838 |title=T Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia |publisher=AccessMedicine |accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref><ref name="pmid10442186">{{cite journal |author=Ascani S |title=T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia: does the expression of CD8+ phenotype justify the identification of a new subtype?

CLL should not be confused with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL), a highly aggressive leukemia most commonly diagnosed in children, and highly treatable in the pediatric setting. 

===Differential diagnosis===
Hematologic disorders that may resemble CLL in their clinical presentation, behavior, and microscopic appearance include mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, B cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
* [[B cell prolymphocytic leukemia]] (B PLL), a related, but more aggressive disorder, has cells with similar phenotype, but are significantly larger than normal lymphocytes and have a prominent nucleolus. The distinction is important as the prognosis and therapy differs from CLL.
* [[Hairy cell leukemia]] is also a neoplasm of B lymphocytes, but the neoplastic cells have a distinct morphology under the microscope (hairy cell leukemia cells have delicate, hair-like projections on their surface) and unique marker molecule expression.

All the B cell malignancies of the blood and bone marrow can be differentiated from one another by the combination of cellular microscopic morphology, marker molecule expression, and specific tumor-associated gene defects. This is best accomplished by evaluation of the patient's blood, bone marrow and occasionally lymph node cells by a [[pathologist]] with specific training in blood disorders. A flow cytometer is necessary for cell marker analysis, and the detection of genetic problems in the cells may require visualizing the DNA changes with fluorescent probes by [[fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]].

==Treatment==
CLL treatment focuses on controlling the disease and its symptoms rather than on an outright cure. CLL is treated by [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[biological therapy]], or [[bone marrow transplantation]]. Symptoms are sometimes treated surgically ([[splenectomy]] removal of enlarged spleen) or by [[radiation therapy]] ("de-bulking" swollen lymph nodes).

Initial CLL treatments vary depending on the exact diagnosis and the progression of the disease, and even with the preference and experience of the health care practitioner. There are dozens of agents used for CLL therapy.<ref name=PDQ>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page5 |title=Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (PDQ) Treatment: Stage I, II, III, and IV Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|author=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-09-04 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017143326/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page5| archivedate= 17 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> An initial treatment regimen that contains [[fludarabine]], [[cyclophosphamide]], and [[rituximab]] (known as FCR) has demonstrated higher overall response rates and complete response rates.<ref name=CTO>{{cite journal |author=Janssens et al |title=Rituximab for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in Treatment-Naïve and Treatment-Experienced Patients |journal=Contemporary Oncology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=24–36 |year=2011 |url=http://www.onclive.com/publications/contemporary-oncology/2011/fall-2011/Rituximab-for-Chronic-Lymphocytic-Leukemia-in-Treatment-Nave-and-Treatment-Experienced-Patients}}</ref>

===During pregnancy===
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.<ref name=Shapira />  Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemias can often be postponed until after the end of the pregnancy.  If treatment is necessary, then giving chemotherapy during the second or third trimesters is less likely to result in [[pregnancy loss]] or [[birth defect]]s than treatment during the [[first trimester]].<ref name=Shapira>{{cite journal|author=Shapira T, Pereg D, Lishner M|title=How I treat acute and chronic leukemia in pregnancy|journal=Blood Rev.|volume=22|issue=5|pages=247–59|year=2008|month=September|pmid=18472198|doi=10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.006}}</ref>

===Decision to treat===
While generally considered incurable, CLL progresses slowly in most cases. Many people with CLL lead normal and active lives for many years—in some cases for decades. Because of its slow onset, early-stage CLL is, in general, not treated since it is believed that early CLL intervention does not improve survival time or quality of life. Instead, the condition is monitored over time to detect any change in the disease pattern.<ref name="CTO"/>

The decision to start CLL treatment is taken when the patient's clinical symptoms or blood counts indicate that the disease has progressed to a point where it may affect the patient's quality of life.

Clinical "staging systems" such as the Rai 4-stage system and the Binet classification can help to determine when and how to treat the patient.<ref name="NCI-CLL-page2"/>

Determining when to start treatment and by what means is often difficult; studies have shown there is no survival advantage to treating the disease too early. The National Cancer Institute Working Group has issued guidelines for treatment, with specific markers that should be met before it is initiated.<ref name="pmid8652811">{{cite journal |author=Cheson BD |title=National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group guidelines for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: revised guidelines for diagnosis and treatment |journal=Blood |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=4990–7 |year=1996 |pmid=8652811 |author-separator=, |author2=Bennett JM |author3=Grever M |display-authors=3 |last4=Kay |first4=N |last5=Keating |first5=MJ |last6=O'Brien |first6=S |last7=Rai |first7=KR }}</ref>

===Chemotherapy===
Combination [[chemotherapy regimen]]s are effective in both newly-diagnosed and relapsed CLL. Combinations of fludarabine with alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide) produce higher response rates and a longer progression-free survival than single agents:

[[Alkylating agent]]s approved for CLL include [[bendamustine]] and [[cyclophosphamide]].

[[Monoclonal antibodies]], such as [[alemtuzumab]] (directed against [[CD52]]) and [[rituximab]] and [[ofatumumab]] (directed against [[CD20]]), are also used.<ref name="CTO"/>

===Stem cell transplantation===
[[Allogeneic]] [[Stem cell transplantation|bone marrow (stem cell) transplantation]] is rarely used as a first-line treatment for CLL due to its risk. There is increasing interest in the use of reduced-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which offers the prospect of cure for selected patients with a suitable donor.<ref name="Dreger">{{cite journal | author=Dreger P, Brand R, Hansz J, Milligan D, Corradini P, Finke J, Deliliers GL, Martino R, Russell N, Van Biezen A, Michallet M, Niederwieser D; Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT | title=Treatment-related mortality and graft-versus-leukemia activity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for chronic lymphocytic leukemia using intensity-reduced conditioning | journal=Leukemia | year=2003 | pages=841–8 | volume=17 | issue=5  | pmid=12750695 | doi=10.1038/sj.leu.2402905}}</ref>

Younger patients that are at high risk for dying from CLL might consider [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT).  [[Autologous stem cell transplantation]], a lower-risk form of treatment using the patient's own blood cells, is not curative.  Myeloablative (bone marrow killing) forms of [[allogeneic stem cell transplantation]], a high-risk treatment using blood cells from a healthy donor, may be curative for some patients, but most patients cannot tolerate the treatment.  An intermediate level, called ''reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation'', may be better tolerated by older or frail patients.<ref name="pmid19147079" />

===Refractory CLL===
"Refractory" CLL is a disease that no longer responds favorably to treatment. In this case more aggressive therapies, including [[lenalidomide]], [[flavopiridol]], and bone marrow (stem cell) transplantation, are considered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page6 |title=Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (PDQ) Treatment: Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|author=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=2007-09-04 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017143330/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page6| archivedate= 17 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The monoclonal antibody, [[alemtuzumab]] (directed against [[CD52]]), may be used in patients with refractory, bone marrow-based disease.<!--

==Complications==
Complications include [[Richter's syndrome]], hypogammaglobulinemia leading to recurrent infection, [[warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] in 10–15% of patients, transformation to high grade lymphoma. 

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia may transform into [[Richter's syndrome]], the development of fast-growing [[diffuse large B cell lymphoma]], [[B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia|prolymphocytic leukemia]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], or [[acute leukemia]] in a patient who has chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Its incidence is estimated to be around 5 percent in patients with CLL.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tsimberidou AM, Keating MJ |title=Richter syndrome: biology, incidence, and therapeutic strategies |journal=Cancer |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=216–28 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15578683 |doi=10.1002/cncr.20773 }}</ref>

Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement can rarely occur with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Some of the reported manifestations include [[Intussusception (medical disorder) |intussusception]], small intestinal bacterial contamination, colitis and others. Usually, GI complications with CLL occur after Richter transformation.  There have been two case reports to date of GI involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia without Richter's transformation.<ref>Bitetto AM, Lamba G, Cadavid G, Shah D, Forlenza T, Rotatori F, Rafiyath SM. Colonic perforation secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltration without Richter transformation. Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 May;52(5):930-3.</ref>

==Epidemiology==
CLL is a disease of older adults, with a median age of 70 years at the time of diagnosis.<ref name=Review_Shansai />  Though less common, CLL sometimes affects people between 30 and 39 years of age.  The incidence of CLL increases very quickly with increasing age.  

In the [[United States]] during 2012, about 16,060 new cases are expected to be diagnosed, and 4,580 patients are expected to die from CLL.<ref name=Cancer_Gov_General>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/healthprofessional/page1 |title=General Information About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia |author=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl= no}}</ref> Because of the prolonged survival, which was typically about ten years in past decades, but which can extend to a normal life expectancy,<ref name="NCI-CLL-page2" /> the [[prevalence]] (number of people living with the disease) is much higher than the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (new diagnoses).

CLL is very rare in Asian countries, such as Japan and China, and may account for as few as 10 percent of all leukemias in those regions.<ref name=Review_Shansai>{{cite journal|last=Shanshal|first=Mohammed|coauthors=Haddad, Rami Y.|title=Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|journal=Disease-a-Month|year=2012|month=April|volume=58|issue=4|pages=153–167|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2012.01.009|pmid= 22449365 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> 

Subclinical "disease" can be identified in 3.5% of normal adults,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rawstron AC |title=Monoclonal B lymphocytes with the characteristics of "indolent" chronic lymphocytic leukemia are present in 3.5% of adults with normal blood counts |journal=Blood |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=635–9 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=12091358 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12091358 |author-separator=, |author2=Green MJ |author3=Kuzmicki A |display-authors=3 |doi=10.1182/blood.V100.2.635 |last4=Kennedy |first4=B |last5=Fenton |first5=JA |last6=Evans |first6=PA |last7=O'Connor |first7=SJ |last8=Richards |first8=SJ |last9=Morgan |first9=GJ}}</ref> and in up to 8% of individuals over the age of 70{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. That is, small clones of B cells with the characteristic CLL phenotype can be identified in many healthy elderly persons. The clinical significance of these cells is unknown.

Of all [[lymphoproliferative disorders|cancers involving the same class of blood cell]], 7% of cases are CLL/SLL.<ref name="isbn0-7817-5007-5">{{cite book

Rates of CLL are somewhat elevated in people exposed to certain chemicals.  Under U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs regulations, Vietnam veterans who served in-country or in the inland waterways of Vietnam and who later develop CLL are presumed to have contracted it from exposure to [[Agent Orange]] and may be entitled to compensation.<ref>http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=150fea5ac37ad66e06bdb4f940a0e0dc&rgn=div8&view=text&node=38:1.0.1.1.4.1.65.117&idno=38></ref>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on the subtype.  The overall [[five-year survival rate]] (all forms of CLL together) is about 50%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chronic Leukemias |work=Merck Manual of Geriatrics |url=http://www.merck.com/mkgr/mmg/sec9/ch73/ch73b.jsp}}</ref>

==Research directions==
Considerable research activity, studying the many treatments individually or in combination, is ongoing.<ref name=PDQ />  Current research is comparing different forms of bone marrow transplants to determine which patients are the best candidates and which approach is best in different situations.<ref name="pmid19147079">{{cite journal |author=Gribben JG |title=Stem cell transplantation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=Biol.
