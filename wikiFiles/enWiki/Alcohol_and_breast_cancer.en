The relationship between '''alcohol and breast cancer''' has been a subject of significant research.  It has long been considered a [[risk factor for breast cancer]] in women.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Are the Risk Factors for Breast Cancer? |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_breast_cancer_5.asp |date=31 May 2009 |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref><ref name = Room>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17870-2 |title=Alcohol and public health |year=2005 |author=Room, R |journal=The Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9458 |pages=519 |last2=Babor |first2=T |last3=Rehm |first3=J | pmid = 15705462 }}</ref>  The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] has declared that there is sufficient scientific evidence to classify alcoholic beverages a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] that causes breast cancer in women.<ref name=IARC>''Alcohol consumption and ethyl carbamate'' [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (2007: Lyon, France) ISBN 9789283212966 </ref>  Group 1 carcinogens are the substances with the clearest scientific evidence that they cause cancer, such as smoking [[tobacco]].

A study of 17,647 nurses found that high drinking levels more than doubled risk of breast cancer with 2% increase risk for each additional drink per week consumed. Binge drinking of 4–5 drinks increases the risk by 55%.<ref name="Mørch">{{cite journal |author=Mørch LS, Johansen D, Thygesen LC, ''et al.'' |title=Alcohol drinking, consumption patterns and breast cancer among Danish nurses: a cohort study |journal=European Journal of Public Health |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=624–9 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17442702 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm036}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
[[Image:BreastCancer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Mastectomy]] specimen containing a very large cancer of the breast (in this case, an invasive [[Mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinoma]]).]]
The mechanisms of increased breast cancer risk by alcohol may be:
*Increased estrogen and androgen levels<ref name="pmid11694156">{{cite journal |author=Singletary KW, Gapstur SM |title=Alcohol and breast cancer: review of epidemiologic and experimental evidence and potential mechanisms |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=17 |pages=2143–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11694156 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.17.2143}}</ref>
*Enhanced mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis<ref name="pmid11694156"/>
*Increased mammary DNA damage<ref name="pmid11694156"/>
*Greater metastatic potential of breast cancer cells<ref name="pmid11694156"/>

Their magnitude likely depends on the amount of alcohol consumed.<ref name="pmid11694156"/>

Susceptibility to the breast cancer risk of alcohol may also be increased by other dietary factors, (e.g. [[folate deficiency]]), lifestyle habits (including use of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]]), or biological characteristics (e.g. as hormone receptor expression in tumor cells).<ref name="pmid11694156"/>

A study on mice suggests that, when breast cancer is established, drinking as little as two alcoholic drinks a day increases the growth rate of tumors. Alcohol causes cancer cells' blood vessels to grow which in turn fuels the growth of the tumor, a process known as [[angiogenesis]].<ref>BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6611009.stm?ls Drinking 'fuels growth of tumour'] 1 May 2007</ref>

==In daughters of drinking mothers==
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol during pregnancy may affect the likelihood of breast cancer in daughters. "For women who are pregnant, ingestion of alcohol, even in moderation, may lead to elevated circulating oestradiol levels, either through a reduction of melatonin or some other mechanism. This may then affect the developing mammary tissue such that the lifetime risk of breast cancer is raised in their daughters."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stevens RG, Hilakivi-Clarke L |title=Alcohol exposure in utero and breast cancer risk later in life |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=276–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11373268 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/36.3.276}}</ref>

==Type of drink==
Studies are ambiguous, with some stating that the type of drink is not a factor,<ref name=laurace>Jeremy Laurance [http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article3001632.ece Three drinks a day increases risk of breast cancer by a third] ''The Independent'' 27 September 2007</ref> while one study suggests that women who frequently drink red wine may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=M Maggiolini, A G Recchia, D Bonofiglio, S Catalano, A Vivacqua, A Carpino, V Rago, R Rossi and S Andò |title=The red wine phenolics piceatannol and myricetin act as agonists for estrogen receptor alpha in human breast cancer cells |journal=J Mol Endocrinol |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=269–81 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16216908 |doi=10.1677/jme.1.01783 }}</ref>

==Moderate drinking==
Moderate alcohol consumption has also been found to increase the breast cancer risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang SM, Lee IM, [[JoAnn E. Manson|Manson JE]], Cook NR, Willett WC, Buring JE |title=Alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk in the Women's Health Study |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=165 |issue=6 |pages=667–76 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17204515 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwk054}}</ref>

One of the largest studies of its kind has found that alcohol is a substantial risk factor for development of the most common type of breast cancer - the 70% of tumors that are classified as positive for both the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER+/PR+). Researchers report that even moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one or two drinks per day, increased risk of developing this kind of cancer, and the more a woman drank, the higher her risk. Compared to women who did not drink at all, women who had three or more glasses of alcohol daily had as much as a 51% increased risk of ER+/PR+ breast cancer.<ref>[http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/news-releases.aspx?d=1035 How What and How Much We Eat (And Drink) Affects Our Risk of Cancer]</ref>

In contrast, research by the Danish [http://www.niph.dk/ National Institute for Public Health], comprising 13,074 women aged 20 to 91 years, found that moderate drinking had virtually no effect on breast cancer risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Petri AL, Tjønneland A, Gamborg M, ''et al.'' |title=Alcohol intake, type of beverage, and risk of breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women |journal=Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=1084–90 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15252295 |doi=10.1097/01.ALC.0000130812.85638.E1}}</ref>

== Recurrence ==
Moderate to heavy consumption of alcoholic beverages (at least three to four drinks per week) is associated with a 1.3-fold increased risk of the recurrence of breast cancer.<ref>American Association for Cancer Research [http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/aacr-press-releases/press-releases-2009.aspx?d=1703 Alcohol Consumption Increases Risk of Breast Cancer Recurrence] 10 December 2009</ref><ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8406273.stm Alcohol link to breast cancer recurrence] 11 December 2009</ref>

==In men==
In men, breast cancer is rare, with an incidence of fewer than one case per 100,000 men.<ref>[http://www.cancerindex.org/clinks3m.htm Male Breast Cancer]</ref> Population studies have returned mixed results about excessive consumption of alcohol as a risk factor. One study suggests that alcohol consumption may increase risk at a rate of 16% per 10g daily alcohol consumption.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1023/B:CACO.0000036154.18162.43}}</ref> Others have shown no effect at all, though these studies had small populations of alcoholics.<ref>{{cite pmid|18840816}}</ref>
