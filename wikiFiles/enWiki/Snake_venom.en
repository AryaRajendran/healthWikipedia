'''Snake venom''' is highly modified [[saliva]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Reptile Venom Research|url=http://www.reptilepark.com.au/venom_snake.asp|publisher=Australian Reptile Park|accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref> containing [[zootoxin]]s used by [[snake]]s to immobilize and digest [[prey]] or to serve as a defence mechanism against a potential [[predator]] or other threat.

== Chemistry ==
[[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]], the son of [[Lucien Bonaparte]], younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], was the first to establish the proteinaceous nature of snake venom in 1843.

[[Proteins]] constitute 90-95% of venom's dry weight and they are responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, [[neurotoxin]]s in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones.<ref name=Bauchot/> Enzymes ([[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and [[metalloproteinases]] (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. [[Polypeptide]] toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include [[cytotoxin]]s, [[cardiotoxin]]s, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as [[Alpha-Bungarotoxin|α-bungarotoxin]] and [[Cobratoxin|α-Cobratoxin]]), which bind to [[acetylcholine receptor]]s at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic.<ref name=Firefly/> [[Phosphodiesterase]]s interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the [[blood pressure]]. [[Phospholipase A2]] causes [[hemolysis]] by lysing the [[phospholipid]] [[cell membranes]] of [[red blood cells]].<ref name="pmid14124757">{{cite journal |author=CONDREA E, DEVRIES A, MAGER J |title=HEMOLYSIS AND SPLITTING OF HUMAN ERYTHROCYTE PHOSPHOLIPIDS BY SNAKE VENOMS |journal=Biochim.

Snake toxins vary greatly in their functions. Two major classifications of toxins found in snake venoms include [[neurotoxin]]s (mostly found in elapids) and [[hemotoxin]]s (mostly found in viperids). However, there are exceptions - an African spitting cobra [[Naja nigricollis]]'s venom consists mainly of hemotoxins, while the [[Mojave rattlesnake]]'s venom is primarily neurotoxic. However, there are numerous other different types of toxins which both elapids or viperids may carry.

== Toxins ==

===Neurotoxins===
{{Synapse map}}

''The beginning of a new impulse'':

A) An exchange of ions (charged atoms) across the nerve cell membrane sends a depolarising current towards the end of the nerve cell (cell terminus).

B) When the depolarising current arrives at the nerve cell terminus, the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh), which is held in vesicles, is released into the space between the two nerves (synapse). It moves across the synapse to the postsynaptic receptors.

C) If ACh remains at the receptor, the nerve stays stimulated, causing incontrollable muscle contractions. This condition is called tetany.  An enzyme called acetylcholinesterase destroys the ACh so tetany does not occur.

'''Fasciculins:'''

These toxins attack cholinergic neurons (those that use ACh as a transmitter) by destroying acetylcholinesterase (AChE). ACh therefore cannot be broken down and stays in the receptor. This causes tetany, which can lead to death. The toxins have been called fasciculins since after injection into [[mice]], they cause severe, generalized and long-lasting (5-7 h) fasciculations.

''Snake example: found mostly in venom of [[Mamba]]s and some [[rattlesnake]]s''

'''[[Dendrotoxin]]s:'''

Dendrotoxins inhibit neurotransmissions by blocking the exchange of positive and negative ions across the neuronal membrane lead to no nerve impulse, thereby paralysing the nerves.

''Snake example: [[Mamba]]s''

'''α-neurotoxins''':

This is a large group of toxins, with over 100 postsynaptic neurotoxins having been identified and sequenced.<ref>{{cite book | title=Hodgson WC, Wickramaratna JC. In vitro neuromuscular activity of snake venoms.|year=2002}}</ref>
α-neurotoxins also attack cholinergic neurons. They mimic the shape of the acetylcholine molecule and therefore fit into the receptors → they block the ACh flow → feeling of numbness and paralysis.

''Snake examples:

- [[King Cobra]] (known as hannahtoxin containing α-neurotoxins)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=16016072 |title=Cloning and purification of α-neurotoxins from king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref>

- [[Sea snake]] (known as erabutoxin)

- [[Many-banded krait]] (known as [[α-Bungarotoxin]])

- [[Cobras]] (known as [[cobratoxin]])'',

=== Cytotoxins ===

[[File:Fully functional membrane.jpg|300px|Fully functional membrane]]

'''[[Phospholipase]]s:'''

Phospholipase is an enzyme that transforms the phospholipid molecule into a lysophospholipid (soap) ==> the new molecule attracts and binds fat and ruptures cell membranes.

''Snake example: Japanese Habu''

[[File:Destroyed membrane.JPG|300px|Destroyed membrane]]

'''[[Cardiotoxin]]s:'''

Cardiotoxins are components that are specifically toxic to the heart. They bind to particular sites on the surface of muscle cells and cause depolarisation ==> the toxin prevents muscle contraction. These toxins may cause the heart to beat irregularly or stop beating, causing death.

''Snake example: [[King Cobra]], [[Mamba]]s, and some members of [[Naja]] genus''

'''[[Hemotoxin]]s:'''

The toxin causes hemolysis, or destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes).

''Snake example: most [[Viperidae|Vipers]] and the many members of [[Naja]] genus''

==Injection==

===Vipers===
In the [[Viperidae|viper]]s, which have the most highly developed venom delivery apparatus, the venom gland is very large and is surrounded by the [[masseter]] or [[temporal muscle]], which consists of two bands, the superior arising from behind the eye, the inferior extending from the gland to the mandible. A duct carries venom from the gland to the fang. In vipers and elapids, this groove is completely closed, forming a hypodermic needle-like tube. In other species, the grooves are not covered, or only partially covered. From the anterior extremity of the gland, the duct passes below the eye and above the [[maxillary bone]], to the basal orifice of the venom fang, which is ensheathed in a thick fold of [[mucous membrane]]. By means of the movable maxillary bone hinged to the prefrontal bone and connected with the tranverse bone which is pushed forward by muscles set in action by the opening of the mouth, the fang is erected and the venom discharged through the distal orifice. When the snake bites, the jaws close and the muscles surrounding the gland contract, causing venom to be ejected via the fangs.

===Elapids===
In the [[proteroglypha|proteroglyphous]] [[elapid]]s, the fangs are tubular, but are short and do not possess the mobility seen in vipers.

===Colubrids===
[[opisthoglypha|Opisthoglyphous]] [[colubrid]]s have enlarged, grooved teeth situated at the posterior extremity of the [[maxilla]], where a small posterior portion of the upper labial or salivary gland produces venom.

===Mechanics of biting===
[[Image:ViperaBerusFang.JPG|thumb|250px|right| [[Vipera berus]], one fang with a small venom stain in glove, the other still in place]]

Several genera, including ''Calliophis'', ''Atractaspis'' and ''[[Causinae|Causus]]'', are remarkable for having exceptionally long venom glands, extending along each side of the body, in some cases extending posterially as far as the heart. Instead of the muscles of the temporal region serving to press out the venom into the duct, this action is performed by those of the side of the body.

There is considerable variability in biting behavior among snakes. When biting, viperid snakes often strike quickly, discharging venom as the fangs penetrate the skin, and then immediately release. Alternatively, as in the case of a feeding response, some viperids (e.g. Lachesis) will bite and hold. A [[proteroglyph]] or [[opisthoglyph]], may close its jaws and bite or chew firmly for a considerable time.

===Mechanics of spitting===
[[Spitting cobras]] of the genera ''[[Naja]]'' and ''[[Hemachatus]]'', when irritated or threatened, may eject streams or a spray of venom a distance of 4 to 8 feet. These snakes' fangs have been modified for the purposes of spitting: inside the fangs, the channel makes a ninety degree bend to the lower front of the fang. Spitters may spit repeatedly and still be able to deliver a fatal bite.

Spitting is a defensive reaction only. The snakes tend to aim for the eyes of a perceived threat. A direct hit can cause temporary shock and blindness through severe [[inflammation]] of the [[cornea]] and [[conjunctiva]]. Although usually there are no serious results if the venom is washed away immediately with plenty of water, blindness can become permanent if left untreated. Brief contact with the skin is not immediately dangerous, but open wounds may be vectors for envenomation.

==Some effects==

There are four distinct types of venom that act on the body differently.
* ''[[Proteolytic]] venom'' dismantles the molecular structure of the area surrounding and including the bite.
* ''[[Hemotoxic]] venoms'' act on the heart and cardiovascular system.
* ''[[Neurotoxic]] venom'' acts on the nervous system and brain.
* ''[[Cytotoxic]] venom'' has a localized action at the site of the bite.

It is noteworthy that the size of the venom fangs is in no relation to the virulence of the venom. The comparatively innocent Indo-Malay [[Lachesis (genus)|Lachesis]] alluded to above have enormous fangs, whilst the smallest fangs are found in the [[Hydrophid]]s which possess very potent venom.

===Proteroglyphous snakes===
The effect of the venom of [[proteroglyphous]] snakes(''[[Hydrophids]]'', ''[[Bungarus]]'', ''[[Mamba|Dendroaspis]]'', ''[[Elaps]]'', ''[[Pseudechis]]'', ''[[Notechis]]'', ''[[Acanthophis]]'') is mainly on the [[nervous system]], respiratory [[paralysis]] being quickly produced by bringing the venom into contact with the central nervous mechanism which controls respiration; the pain and local swelling which follow a bite are not usually severe.

The bite of all the proteroglyphous elapids, even of the smallest and gentlest, such as the ''Elaps'' or [[coral snakes]], is, so far as known, deadly to humans.

===Vipers===
Viper venom (''[[Daboia]]'', ''[[Echis]]'', ''[[Lachesis (genus)|Lachesis]]'', ''[[Crotalus]]'') acts more on the vascular system, bringing about coagulation of the blood and clotting of the pulmonary arteries; its action on the nervous system is not great, no individual group of [[nerve-cell]]s appears to be picked out, and the effect upon respiration is not so direct; the influence upon the circulation explains the great depression which is a symptom of viperine envenomation. The pain of the wound is severe, and is speedily followed by swelling and discoloration. The symptoms produced by the bite of the European vipers are thus described by Martin and Lamb:<ref>{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Charles James |coauthors=Lamb, George |editor=Allbutt, T.C., Rolleston N.D. |title=A System of Medicine |year=1907 |publisher=MacMillan |location=London |isbn= |id= |pages=783–821 |chapter=Snake-poison and Snake-bite}}</ref>

<blockquote>The bite is immediately followed by local pain of a burning character; the limb soon swells and becomes discoloured, and within one to three hours great prostration, accompanied by [[vomiting]], and often [[diarrhoea]], sets in. Cold, clammy perspiration is usual. The pulse becomes extremely feeble, and slight [[dyspnoea]] and restlessness may be seen. In severe cases, which occur mostly in children, the pulse may become imperceptible and the extremities cold; the patient may pass into [[coma]]. In from twelve to twenty-four hours these severe constitutional symptoms usually pass off; but in the meantime the swelling and discoloration have spread enormously. The limb becomes phlegmonous, and occasionally suppurates. Within a few days recovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but [[death]] may result from the severe depression or from the secondary effects of [[suppuration]]. That cases of death, in adults as well as in children, are not infrequent in some parts of the Continent is mentioned in the last chapter of this Introduction.</blockquote>

The Viperidae differ much among themselves in the toxicity of their venom. Some, such as the Indian ''Daboia russelli'' and ''Echis carinatus''; the American vipers ''[[Crotalus]]'', ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' and ''[[Bothrops lanceolatus]]''; and the [[Africa]]n ''Causus'', ''Bitis'', and ''Cerastes'', cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. On the other hand, the Indian and Malay ''Lachesis'' seldom cause the death of humans, their bite in some instances being no worse than the sting of a hornet. The bite of the larger European vipers may be very dangerous, and followed by fatal results, especially in children, at least in the hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small ''[[Vipera ursinii]]'', which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, does not seem to be possessed of a very virulent venom, and, although very common in some parts of [[Austria]]-[[Hungary]], is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.

===Opisthoglyphous colubrids===

Biologists had long known that some snakes had rear fangs, 'inferior' venom injection mechanisms that might immobilize prey; although a few fatalities were on record, until 1957 the possibility that such snakes were deadly to humans seemed at most remote. The deaths of two prominent herpetologists from African colubrid bites changed that assessment, and recent events reveal that several other species of rear-fanged snakes have venoms that are potentially lethal to large vertebrates.

[[Boomslang]] and [[twig snake]] venom are toxic to blood cells and thin the blood (hemotoxic, hemorrhagic). Early symptoms include headaches, nausea, diarrhea, lethargy, mental disorientation, bruising and bleeding at the site and all body openings. [[Exsanguination]] is the main cause of death from such a bite.

The Groen Boomslang's venom is the most potent of all rear-fanged snakes in the world based on [[LD50]]. Although its venom may be more potent than some vipers and elapids, it causes fewer fatalities owing to various factors (for example, the fangs' effectiveness is not high compared with many other snakes: the venom dose delivered is low, and boomslangs are generally less aggressive in comparison to other venomous snakes such as [[cobra]]s and [[mamba]]s).

Symptoms of a bite from these snakes include nausea and internal bleeding, and one could die from a [[brain hemorrhage]] and [[respiratory failure|respiratory collapse]].

===Aglyphous snakes===
Experiments made with the secretion of the [[parotid gland]] of ''Tropidonotus'' and ''Zamenis'' have shown that even [[Aglypha|aglyphous]] snakes are not entirely devoid of venom, and point to the conclusion that the physiological difference between so-called harmless and venomous snakes is only one of degree, just as there are various steps in the transformation of an ordinary parotid gland into a venom gland or of a solid tooth into a tubular or grooved fang.

==Immunity ==

===Among snakes===
The question whether individual snakes are immune to their own venom has not yet been definitively settled, though there is a known example of a cobra which self-envenomated, resulting in a large abscess requiring surgical intervention but showing none of the other effects that would have proven rapidly lethal in prey species or humans.<ref name="cobra">{{cite web|title=Sterile tail abscess in Naja annulifera - self-envenomation case|url=http://www.snakegetters.com/demo/haje/index.html|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref> Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the [[North America]]n ''[[Lampropeltis getula]]'' and the [[Brazil]]ian ''Rhacidelus brazili'', are proof against the venom of the [[crotalines]] which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The Tropical Rat Snake, ''Spilotes variabilis'', is the enemy of the Fer-de-lance in St. Lucia, and it is said{{By whom|date=August 2012}} that in their encounters the Tropical Rat Snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European Common Snake, ''Tropidonotus natrix'', not to be affected by the bite of ''[[Vipera berus]]'' and ''[[Vipera aspis]]'', this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of Rat snakes as well as King snakes have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species.

===Among other animals===
The [[Hedgehog]], the [[Mongoose]], the [[Honey Badger]], the [[Secretary Bird]] and a few other [[bird]]s that feed on snakes are known to be immune to a dose of snake venom. Whether the [[pig]] may be considered so is still uncertain, although it is well known that, owing to its [[subcutaneous]] layer of fat, it is often bitten without ill effect. The [[garden dormouse]] (''Eliomys quercinus'') has recently been added to the list of animals refractory to viper venom.  Some populations of [[California Ground Squirrel]] are at least partially immune to [[Rattlesnake]] venom as adults.

===Among humans===
The acquisition of human immunity against snake venom is one of the oldest forms of vaccinology known to date (about AD 60, [[Psylli]] Tribe). Research into development of vaccines that will lead to immunity is ongoing. [[Bill Haast]], owner and director of the Miami Serpentarium injected himself with snake venom during most of his adult life, in an effort to build up an immunity to a broad array of venomous snakes. It is a practice known as [[mithridatism]]. Haast lived to age 100, and survived a reported 172 snake bites. He donated his blood to be used in treating snake-bite victims when a suitable anti-venom was not available. More than twenty of those individuals recovered.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.floridatrend.com/article.asp?page=1&aID=56043&slug=farewell-to-these-famous-floridians|accessdate=2 April 2012|newspaper=Florida Trend|date=December 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Carol Rosenberg |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/21/local/la-me-bill-haast-20110621 |title=Bill Haast obituary: Snake-venom believer Haast dies at 100 - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1999-08-30 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Schudel |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bill-haast-dies-at-100-florida-snake-man-provided-venom-for-snakebite-serum/2011/06/18/AGgZjfaH_story.html |title=Bill Haast dies at 100: Florida snake man provided venom for snakebite serum |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref>

==Traditional Treatments==
The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 80% of the world’s population depends on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs.<ref>http://www.ethnoleaflets.com/leaflets/chitra.htm</ref> Methods of traditional treament of snake bite, although of questionable efficacy and perhaps even harmful, are nonetheless relevant. 

Plants used to treat snakebites in Trinidad and Tobago are made into tinctures with alcohol or olive oil and kept in rum flasks called 'snake bottles'. Snake bottles contain several different plants and/ or insects. The plants used include the vine called monkey ladder (''[[Bauhinia cumanensis]]'' or ''[[Bauhinia excisa]]'', Fabaceae) which is pounded and put on the bite. Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the vine and kept in a snake bottle.  Other plants used include: mat root (''[[Aristolochia|Aristolochia rugosa]]''), cat's claw (''[[Pithecellobium|Pithecellobim unguis-cati]]''), tobacco (''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]''), snake bush (''[[Barleria lupulina]]''), obie seed (''[[Kola nut|Cola nitida]]''), and wild gri gri root (''[[Acrocomia aculeata]]''). Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars (''[[Battus polydamas]]'', Papilionidae) that eat tree leaves (''[[Aristolochia|Aristolochia trilobata]]''). Emergency snake medicines are obtained by chewing a three-inch piece of the root of bois canôt (''[[Cecropia peltata]]'') and administering this chewed-root solution to the bitten subject (usually a hunting dog). This is a common native plant of Latin America and the Caribbean which makes it appropriate as an emergency remedy. Another native plant used is mardi gras (''[[Renealmia|Renealmia alpinia]]'')(berries), which are crushed together with the juice of wild cane (''[[Costus|Costus scaber]]'') and given to the bitten. Quick fixes have included applying chewed tobacco from cigarettes, cigars or pipes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/pdfs/mb/Sham_ritual_snakebite_jep_1982.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Document10 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref> Making cuts around the puncture or sucking out the venom had been thought helpful, in the past, but this course of treatment is now strongly discouraged <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/gaston/Pests/reptiles/snakebitetx.htm |title=Treating Snake Bites |publisher=Ces.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/ |title=CDC - Venomous Snakes - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref>

===Serotherapy===
Especially noteworthy is progress regarding the defensive reaction by which the blood may be rendered proof against their effect, by processes similar to vaccination—antipoisonous serotherapy.

The studies to which we allude have not only conduced to a method of treatment against snake-bites, but have thrown a new light on the great problem of immunity.

They have shown that the antitoxic [[antivenom|sera]] do not act as chemical [[antidote]]s in destroying the venom, but as physiological antidotes; that, in addition to the venom glands, snakes possess other glands supplying their blood with substances antagonistic to the venom, such as also exist in various animals refractory to snake venom, the [[hedgehog]] and the [[mongoose]] for instance.

===Regional venom specificity ===
Unfortunately, the specificity of the different snake venoms is such that, even when the physiological action appears identical, serum injections or graduated direct inoculations confer immunity towards one species or a few allied species only.

Thus, a [[Europe]]an in [[Australia]] who had become immune to the venom of the deadly Australian Tiger Snake, ''[[Notechis scutatus]]'', manipulating these snakes with impunity, and was under the impression that his immunity extended also to other species, when bitten by a ''Denisonia superba'', an allied elapine, died the following day.

In [[India]], the serum prepared with the venom of ''Naja tripudians'' has been found to be without effect on the venom of the two species of kraits of the genus ''[[Bungarus]]'', and the Old World vipers ''[[Daboia russelli]]'' and ''[[Echis carinatus]]'', and the pit viper ''[[Trimeresurus popeiorum]]''. ''[[Daboia russelli]]'' serum is without effect on colubrine venoms, or those of ''[[Echis]]'' and ''[[Trimeresurus]]''.

In [[Brazil]], serum prepared with the venom of the New World pit viper ''[[Lachesis lanceolatus]]'' is without action on ''[[Crotalus]]'' venom.

Antivenom snakebite treatment must be matched as the type of envenomation that has occurred.

In the Americas, polyvalent antivenoms are available that are effective against the bites of most pit vipers. [[Crofab]] is the antivenom developed to treat the bite of North American pit-vipers.<ref>http://www.savagelabs.com/Products/CroFab/Home/crofab_frame.htm Link to PDF for full prescribing information, retrieved 11/12/12</ref> 

These are not effective against [[coral snake]] envenomation, which requires a specific antivenom to their neurotoxic venom.

The situation is even more complex in countries like India, with its rich mix of vipers (family [[Viperidae]]) and highly neurotoxic [[cobra]]s and [[krait]]s of the family [[Elapidae]].
