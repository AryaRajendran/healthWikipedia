==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
City-wide ambulance service was originally introduced by the [[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal]] in 1958. Many of the suburban municipalities followed Montréal's lead; island-wide service was provided when police services were centralized under the Montreal Urban Community in 1970. By the late 1970s, however, police ambulance training and equipment had fallen behind contemporary standards and the service was finally withdrawn. Urgences Santé was created in 1981 by forming a centralized dispatch system for the region's 25 privately owned ambulance services. The original full name was ''Centre de coordination des urgences santé'' (Health Emergencies Coordination Centre). As part of the program, a single telephone number for emergency medical services was introduced for the islands of Montreal and Laval (514-842-4242). All private services were invited to use Urgences Santé for dispatch and later, billing. The contracting companies were paid to maintain ambulance availability and on a per-call basis. Consolidation of the private companies and the formation of a militant labour organization caused much instability including a strike in 1986. In 1989, following the transfer of ambulance service to the health and social services department, the system was re-organized and formalized by an act of the [[Quebec National Assembly]].
