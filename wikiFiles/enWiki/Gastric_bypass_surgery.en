'''Gastric bypass''' procedures (GBP) are any of a group of similar operations that first divides the [[stomach]] into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower "remnant" pouch and then re-arranges the [[small intestine]] to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different GBP names. Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food.

The operation is prescribed to treat [[morbid obesity]] (defined as a [[body mass index]] greater than 40), [[type 2 diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[sleep apnea]], and other [[comorbid]] conditions. ''[[Bariatric surgery]]'' is the term encompassing ''all'' of the surgical treatments for morbid obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up only one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically dramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of gastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to 40%.<ref>{{Citation |author=Adams TD, Gress RE, Smith SC, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term mortality after gastric bypass surgery |journal=N.

== Surgical indications ==

Gastric bypass is indicated for the surgical treatment of morbid [[obesity]], a diagnosis which is made when the patient is seriously obese, has been unable to achieve satisfactory and sustained weight loss by dietary efforts, and is suffering from comorbid conditions which are either life-threatening or a serious impairment to the quality of life.

In the past, serious obesity was interpreted to mean weighing at least {{convert|100|lb|kg}} more than the "ideal body weight", an actuarially determined body weight at which one was estimated to be likely to live the longest, as determined by the life insurance industry. This criterion failed for persons of short stature.

In 1991, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) sponsored a consensus panel whose recommendations have set the current standard for consideration of surgical treatment, the '''[[body mass index]]''' (BMI). The BMI is defined as the body weight (in kilograms), divided by the square of the height (in meters). The result is expressed as a number usually between 20 and 70, in units of kilograms per square meter.

The Consensus Panel of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommended the following criteria for consideration of bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass procedures:
*People who have a BMI of 40 or higher
*People with a BMI of 35 or higher with one or more related comorbid conditions

The Consensus Panel also emphasized the necessity of multidisciplinary care of the bariatric surgical patient by a team of physicians and therapists to manage associated comorbidities and nutrition, physical activity, behavior, and psychological needs. The surgical procedure is best regarded as a ''tool'' which enables the patient to alter lifestyle and eating habits, and to achieve effective and permanent management of their obesity and eating behavior.

Since 1991, major developments in the field of bariatric surgery, particularly [[laparoscopy]], have outdated some of the conclusions of the NIH panel. In 2004, a [[Consensus conferences|consensus conference]] was sponsored by the [[American Society for Bariatric Surgery]] (ASBS), which updated the evidence and the conclusions of the NIH panel. This conference, composed of physicians and scientists of both surgical and non-surgical disciplines, reached several conclusions, amongst which were:
*Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity.
*Gastric bypass is one of four types of operations for morbid obesity.
*Laparoscopic surgery is equally effective and as safe as [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures#Open surgery|open surgery]].
*Patients should undergo comprehensive preoperative evaluation and have multi-disciplinary support for optimum outcome.

==US insurance coverage requirements==
Many individuals who are considering bariatric surgery as a means of solving severe obesity look to insurance for coverage.  Their goal is to obtain coverage for expenses like laboratory and surgical fees. To be considered for coverage, patients usually need to:
* Send in a letter of medical requisite for a bariatric surgeon
* Provide documentation of a medically supervised diet
* Provide evidence of failed attempts to lose weight via diet and exercise.
While some insurance companies may partially cover surgery-related expenses, most do not cover post-operation supplements.<ref>{{cite web |first = Gastric Bypass Staff | publisher = GastricBypass.com | title = Finance and Insurance Info. | url = http://www.gastricbypass.com/index.htm | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2010-10-17}}</ref>

==Surgical techniques==
The gastric bypass, in its various forms, accounts for a large majority of the bariatric surgical procedures performed. It is estimated that 200,000 such operations were performed in the United States in 2008.<ref>Claire Ainsworth, 2009, Full without Food, New Scientist, 5 September 2009, No 2724</ref> An increasing number of these operations are now performed by limited access techniques, termed '''"[[laparoscopy]]"'''.

Laparoscopic surgery is performed using several small incisions, or ''ports'': one to insert a surgical telescope connected to a video camera, and others to permit access of specialized operating instruments. The surgeon views his operation on a video screen. Laparoscopy is also called limited access surgery, reflecting the limitation on handling and feeling tissues and also the limited resolution and two-dimensionality of the video image. With experience, a skilled laparoscopic surgeon can perform most procedures as expeditiously as with an open incision—with the option of using an incision should the need arise.

The '''Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass''', first performed in 1993, is regarded as one of the most difficult procedures to perform by limited access techniques, but use of this method has greatly popularized the operation due to associated benefits such as a shortened hospital stay, reduced discomfort, shorter recovery time, less scarring, and minimal risk of [[incisional hernia]].

===Essential features===
The gastric bypass procedure consists of:

*Creation of a small, (15–30 mL/1–2 tbsp) thumb-sized pouch from the upper stomach, accompanied by bypass of the remaining stomach (about 400 mL and variable). This restricts the volume of food which can be eaten. The stomach may simply be partitioned (typically by the use of [[surgical staple]]s), or it may be totally divided into two parts (also with staples). Total division is usually advocated to reduce the possibility that the two parts of the stomach will heal back together ("[[fistula|fistulize]]") and negate the operation.
*Re-construction of the [[GI tract]] to enable drainage of both segments of the stomach. The particular technique used for this reconstruction produces several variants of the operation, differing in the lengths of small intestine used, the degree to which food absorption is affected, and the likelihood of adverse nutritional effects.

===Variations of the gastric bypass===

====Gastric bypass, Roux en-Y (proximal)====
[[File:Gastric Bypass, Roux en-Y.jpg|right|frame|Graphic of a gastric bypass using a [[Roux-en-Y anastomosis]].]]

This variant is the most commonly employed gastric bypass technique, and is by far the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the United States. The small intestine is divided approximately {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} below the lower stomach outlet and is re-arranged into a Y-configuration, enabling outflow of food from the small upper stomach pouch via a "Roux limb". In the proximal version, the Y-intersection is formed near the upper (proximal) end of the small intestine. The Roux limb is constructed using {{convert|80|&ndash;|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the small intestine, preserving the rest (and the majority) of it for absorbing nutrients. The patient will experience very rapid onset of the stomach feeling full, followed by a growing satiety (or "indifference" to food) shortly after the start of a meal.

====Gastric bypass, Roux en-Y (distal)====
The small intestine is normally {{convert|6|&ndash;|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. As the Y-connection is moved further down the gastrointestinal tract, the amount available to fully absorb nutrients is progressively reduced, traded for greater effectiveness of the operation. The Y-connection is formed much closer to the lower (distal) end of the small intestine, usually {{convert|100|&ndash;|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} from the lower end, causing reduced absorption (malabsorption) of food: primarily of fats and starches, but also of various minerals and the fat-soluble vitamins. The unabsorbed fats and starches pass into the large intestine, where bacterial actions may act on them to produce irritants and malodorous gases. These larger effects on nutrition are traded for a relatively modest increase in total weight loss.

===="Mini-gastric bypass" (MGB)====

The Mini gastric bypass procedure was first developed by Dr Robert Rutledge from the USA in 1997, as a modification of the standard Billroth II procedure. Mini gastric bypass involves making of a long narrow tube of the stomach along its right border, the lesser curvature. A loop of the small gut is brought up and hooked to this tube at about 180 cms from the start of the intestine ([[ligament of Treitz]]).  

Numerous studies show that the loop reconstruction (Billroth II gastrojejunostomy) works more safely when placed low on the stomach, but can be a disaster when placed adjacent to the esophagus. Today thousands of "loops" are used for surgical procedures to treat gastric problems such as ulcers, stomach cancer, and injury to the stomach. The Mini gastric bypass uses the low set loop reconstruction and thus has rare chances of bile reflux.

The MGB has been suggested as an alternative to the Roux en-Y procedure due to the simplicity of its construction, which reduces the challenges of Bariatric surgery. The surgery is becoming more and more popular because of  low risk of complications and good sustained weight loss. It has been estimated that 15.4% of weight loss surgery in Asia is now performed via the MGB technique.<ref>(OBESITY SURGERY Volume 22, Number 3, 502-506, {{doi|10.1007/s11695-011-0547-2}})</ref>

== Physiology ==
The gastric bypass reduces the size of the stomach by well over 90%. A normal stomach can stretch, sometimes to over 1000 mL, while the pouch of the gastric bypass may be 15 mL in size. The gastric bypass pouch is usually formed from the part of the stomach which is least susceptible to stretching. That, and its small original size, prevents any significant long-term change in pouch volume. What does change, over time, is the size of the connection between the stomach and intestine and the ability of the small intestine to hold a greater volume of food. Over time, the functional capacity of the pouch increases; by that time, weight loss has occurred, and the increased capacity should serve to allow maintenance of a lower body weight.

When the patient ingests just a small amount of food, the first response is a stretching of the wall of the stomach pouch, stimulating nerves which tell the brain that the stomach is full. The patient feels a sensation of fullness, as if they had just eaten a large meal—but with just a thumb-full of food. Most people do not stop eating simply in response to a feeling of fullness, but the patient rapidly learns that subsequent bites must be eaten very slowly and carefully, to avoid increasing discomfort or vomiting.

Food is first churned in the stomach before passing into the small intestine. When the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the small intestine comes into contact with nutrients, a number of hormones are released, including [[cholecystokinin]] from the [[duodenum]] and [[PYY]] and [[GLP-1]] from the [[ileum]]. These hormones inhibit further food intake and have thus been dubbed "satiety factors". ''[[Ghrelin]]'' is a hormone that is released in the stomach that stimulates hunger and food intake. Changes in circulating hormone levels after gastric bypass have been hypothesized to produce reductions in food intake and body weight in obese patients. However, these findings remain controversial, and the exact mechanisms by which gastric bypass surgery reduces food intake and body weight have yet to be elucidated.

For example, it is still widely perceived that gastric bypass works by mechanical means, i.e. food restriction and/or malabsorption. Recent clinical and animal studies, however, have indicated that these long-held inferences about the mechanisms of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may not be correct. A growing body of evidence suggests that profound changes in body weight and metabolism resulting from RYGB cannot be explained by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption. One study in rats found that RYGB induced a 19% increase in total and a 31% increase in [[resting energy expenditure]], an effect not exhibited in [[Sleeve gastrectomy|vertical sleeve gastrectomy]] rats.  In addition, pair-fed rats lost only 47% as much weight as their RYGB counterparts. Changes in food intake after RYGB only partially account for the RYGB-induced weight loss, and there is no evidence of clinically significant malabsorption of calories contributing to weight loss. Thus, it appears RYGB affects weight loss by altering the physiology of weight regulation and eating behavior rather than by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption.<ref>Nicholas Stylopoulos, Nicholas, Hoppin, Alison G., Kaplan, Lee M (2009), "Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Enhances Energy Expenditure and Extends Lifespan in Diet-induced Obese Rats", Obesity 17 10, 1839–1847. {{doi|10.1038/oby.2009.207}}</ref>

To gain the maximum benefit from this physiology, it is important that the patient eat only at mealtimes, 5 to 6 small meals daily, and ''not'' graze between meals, which can effectively "bypass the bypass". Concentration on obtaining 80&ndash;100 g of daily protein is necessary. Meals after surgery are 1/4&ndash;1/2 cup, slowly getting to 1 cup by one year.  This requires a change in eating behavior and alteration of long-acquired habits for finding food. In almost every case where weight gain occurs late after surgery, capacity for a meal has not greatly increased. Some assume the cause of regaining weight must be the patient's fault, e.g. eating between meals with high-caloric snack foods, though this has been debated. Others believe it is an unpredictable failure or limitation of the surgery for certain patients (e.g. [[reactive hypoglycemia]]). Of course, there may be no operation which can completely counteract the adverse effects of destructive eating behavior. This surgery is only a tool and as with most tools, if not used correctly, it can be of no use.

==Complications==
Any major surgery involves the potential for complications—adverse events which increase risk, hospital stay, and mortality. Some complications are common to all abdominal operations, while some are specific to bariatric surgery.

===Mortality and complication rates===
The overall rate of complications  during the 30 days following surgery ranges from 7% for laparoscopic procedures to 14.5% for operations through open incisions. One study on mortality revealed a 0% mortality rate out of 401 laparoscopic cases, and 0.6% out of 955 open procedures (24 deaths). Similar mortality rates—30-day mortality of 1.1% (364 deaths), and 90-day mortality of 0.3%—have been recorded in the U.S. Centers of Excellence program, the results being from 33,117 operations at 106 centers.{{http://www.munroeregional.com/bariatric/Potential_Complications_.aspx|date=August 2011}}

Mortality and complications are affected by pre-existing risk factors such as degree of obesity, heart disease, [[obstructive sleep apnea]], [[diabetes mellitus]], and history of prior [[pulmonary embolism]]. It is also affected by the experience of the operating surgeon: the learning curve for laparoscopic bariatric surgery is estimated to be about 100 cases. Supervision and experience is important when selecting a surgeon, as the way a surgeon becomes experienced in dealing with problems is by encountering and solving them.

===Complications of abdominal surgery===

====Infection====
Infection of the incisions or of the inside of the abdomen ([[peritonitis]], [[abscess]]) may occur due to release of bacteria from the bowel during the operation. [[Nosocomial infection]]s, such as [[pneumonia]], bladder or kidney infections, and [[sepsis]] (blood-borne infection) are also possible. Effective short-term use of antibiotics, diligent respiratory therapy, and encouragement of activity within a few hours after surgery can reduce the risks of infections.

====Venous thromboembolism====
Any injury, such as a surgical operation, causes the body to increase the coagulation of the blood. Simultaneously, activity may be reduced. There is an increased probability of formation of clots in the veins of the legs, or sometimes the pelvis, particularly in the morbidly obese patient. A clot which breaks free and floats to the lungs is called a pulmonary embolus, a very dangerous occurrence. Blood thinners are commonly administered before surgery to reduce the probability of this type of complication.

====Hemorrhage====
Many blood vessels must be cut in order to divide the stomach and to move the bowel. Any of these may later begin bleeding, either into the abdomen (intra-abdominal hemorrhage), or into the bowel itself (gastrointestinal hemorrhage). Transfusions may be needed, and re-operation is sometimes necessary. Use of blood thinners to prevent [[Venous thrombosis|venous thromboembolic disease]] may actually increase the risk of hemorrhage slightly.

====Hernia====
A [[hernia]] is an abnormal opening, either within the abdomen or through the abdominal wall muscles. An [[internal hernia]] may result from surgery and re-arrangement of the bowel, and is a cause of bowel obstruction. An incisional hernia occurs when a surgical incision does not heal well; the muscles of the abdomen separate and allow protrusion of a sac-like membrane, which may contain bowel or other abdominal contents, and which can be painful and unsightly. The risk of abdominal-wall hernia is markedly decreased in laparoscopic surgery.

====Bowel obstruction====
Abdominal surgery always results in some scarring of the bowel, called [[adhesions]]. A hernia, either internal or through the abdominal wall, may also result. When bowel becomes trapped by adhesions or a hernia, it may become kinked and obstructed, sometimes many years after the original procedure. An operation is usually necessary to correct this problem.

===Complications of gastric bypass===

====Anastomotic leakage====
An [[anastomosis]] is a surgical connection between the stomach and bowel, or between two parts of the bowel. The surgeon attempts to create a water-tight connection by connecting the two organs with either staples or sutures, either of which actually makes a hole in the bowel wall. The surgeon will rely on the body's natural healing abilities and its ability to create a seal, like a self-sealing tire, to succeed with the surgery. If that seal fails to form for any reason, fluid from within the gastrointestinal tract can leak into the sterile abdominal cavity and give rise to infection and abscess formation. Leakage of an anastomosis can occur in about 2% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and less than 1% in mini gastric bypass. Leaks usually occur at the stomach-intestine connection (gastro-jejunostomy). There is a change in the drain fluid contents from serous (before the leak) to fecal/bilious (after the leak). Usually significant leaks need urgent re-operation. Sometimes a minor leakage can be treated with antibiotics only. It is usually safer to re-operate if an infection cannot be definitely controlled immediately.

====Anastomotic stricture====
As the anastomosis heals, it forms scar tissue, which naturally tends to shrink ("contract") over time, making the opening smaller. This is called a "stricture". Usually, the passage of food through an anastomosis will keep it stretched open, but if the inflammation and healing process outpaces the stretching process, scarring may make the opening so small that even liquids can no longer pass through it. The solution is a procedure called gastroendoscopy, and stretching of the connection by inflating a balloon inside it. Sometimes this manipulation may have to be performed more than once to achieve lasting correction.

====Anastomotic ulcer====
Ulceration of the anastomosis occurs in 1&ndash;16% of patients.<ref>{{Citation

* [[Ischemia|Restricted blood supply]] to the anastomosis (compared to the blood supply available to the original stomach)
* Anastomosis tension
* [[Gastric acid]]
* The bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''
* [[Smoking]]
* Use of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s
This condition can be treated with:
* [[Proton pump inhibitor]]s, e.g. [[esomeprazole]]
* A [[cytoprotectant]] and acid [[buffering agent]], e.g. [[sucralfate]]
* Temporary restriction of the consumption of solid foods

====Dumping syndrome====
Normally, the [[pyloric valve]] at the lower end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a physiological reaction called [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]]. The body will flood the intestines in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may feel their heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into a cold sweat, get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have an anxiety attack. The person usually has to lie down, and could be very uncomfortable for 30&ndash;45 minutes. Diarrhea may then follow.

=== Nutritional deficiencies===
Nutritional deficiencies are common after gastric bypass surgery, and are often not recognized. They include:<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948694|last1=John|first1=S|last2=Hoegerl|first2=C |title=Nutritional deficiencies after gastric bypass surgery.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=601-604 |year=2009 |pmid=19948694}}</ref>
*Secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]] due to inadequate absorption of calcium may occur for GBP patients. Calcium is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is bypassed by the surgery. Most patients can achieve adequate calcium absorption by supplementation with [[vitamin D]] and [[calcium citrate]] (carbonate may not be absorbed—it requires an acidic stomach, which is bypassed).
*[[Iron deficiency|Iron]] frequently is seriously deficient, particularly in menstruating females, and must be supplemented. Again, it is normally absorbed in the duodenum. [[Ferrous sulfate]] can cause considerable GI distress in normal doses; alternatives include [[ferrous fumarate]], or a [[chelation|chelated]] form of iron. Occasionally, a female patient develops severe anemia, even with supplements, and must be treated with [[parenteral]] iron.  The signs of iron deficiency include: brittle nails, an inflamed tongue, constipation, depression, headaches, fatigue, and mouth lesions.<ref name="Poitou Bernert, C., Ciangura, C., Coupaye, M., Czernichow, S., Bouillot, J.L., & Basdevant, A. 2007 13–24">{{Citation | author = Poitou Bernert, C., Ciangura, C., Coupaye, M., Czernichow, S., Bouillot, J.L., & Basdevant, A. | title = Nutritional deficiency after gastric bypass: diagnosis, prevention and treatment. | journal = Diabetes & Metabolism | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–24 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.diabet.2006.11.004 | postscript = .}}</ref>
*Signs and symptoms of [[zinc deficiency]] may also occur such as: acne, [[eczema]], white spots on the nails, hair loss, depression, amnesia, and lethargy.<ref>{{Citation | author = Madan, A.

*Deficiency of [[thiamine]] (also known as vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) brings the risk of permanent neurological damage (i.e. [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]] or [[polyneuropathy]]).  Signs of thiamin deficiency are heart failure, memory loss, numbness of the hands, constipation, and loss of appetite.<ref name="Poitou Bernert, C., Ciangura, C., Coupaye, M., Czernichow, S., Bouillot, J.L., & Basdevant, A. 2007 13–24"/>
*[[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] requires [[intrinsic factor]] from the [[gastric mucosa]] to be absorbed. In patients with a small gastric pouch, it may not be absorbed, even if supplemented orally, and deficiencies can result in [[pernicious anemia]] and [[neuropathies]]. Sublingual B<sub>12</sub> ([[cyanocobalamin]]) appears to be adequately absorbed. In cases where sublingual B<sub>12</sub> does not provide sufficient amounts, injections may be needed.
*[[Malnutrition|Protein malnutrition]] is a real risk. Some patients suffer troublesome vomiting after surgery, until their GI tract adjusts to the changes, and ''cannot'' eat adequate amounts even with 6 meals a day. Many patients require protein supplementation during the early phases of rapid weight loss to prevent excessive loss of muscle mass. Hair loss is also a risk of protein malnutrition.
*[[Vitamin A]] deficiencies generally occur as a result of fat-soluble vitamins deficiencies. This often comes after intestinal bypass procedures such as [[jejunoileal bypass]] (no longer performed) or [[Bariatric surgery#Biliopancreatic diversion|biliopancreatic diversion]]/[[duodenal switch]] procedures. In these procedures, fat absorption is markedly impaired. There is also the possibility of a vitamin A deficiency with use of the weight-loss medication [[orlistat]] (marketed as Xenical and Alli).
*[[Folate]] deficiency is also a common occurrence in gastric bypass surgery patients.

====Nutritional effects====
After surgery, patients feel fullness after ingesting only a small volume of food, followed soon thereafter by a sense of satiety and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cyanocobalamin) supplements are all very important to the post-operative bypass patient.

Total food intake and absorbance rate of food will rapidly decline after gastric bypass surgery, and the number of [[Parietal cell|acid-producing cells]] lining the stomach increases. Doctors often prescribe acid-lowering medications to counteract the high acidity levels. Many patients then experience a condition known as [[achlorhydria]], where there is not enough acid in stomach. As a result of the low acidity levels, patients can develop an overgrowth of bacteria. A study conducted on 43 post-operative patients revealed that almost all of the patients tested positive for a [[hydrogen breath test]], which indicated an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine.<ref>{{Citation |author =Adams, T., Avelar, E., Cloward, T., R., Farney, R.G., Halverson, C.R., Hopkin, P.N.,...& Hunt, S. |title=Design and rationale of the Utah obesity study.

Recurring nausea and vomiting eventually change the absorbance rate of food, contributing to the vitamin and nutrition deficiencies common in post-operative gastric bypass patients.

=====Protein nutrition=====
Proteins are essential food substances, contained in foods such as meat, fish and poultry, dairy products, soy, nuts, and eggs. With reduced ability to eat a large volume of food, gastric bypass patients must focus on eating their protein requirements first, and with each meal. In some cases, surgeons may recommend use of a liquid protein supplement. Powdered protein supplements added to smoothies or any food can be an important part of the post-op diet.

=====Calorie nutrition=====
The profound weight loss which occurs after bariatric surgery is due to taking in much less energy (calories) than the body needs to use every day. Fat tissue must be burned to offset the deficit, and weight loss results. Eventually, as the body becomes smaller, its energy requirements are decreased, while the patient simultaneously finds it possible to eat somewhat more food. When the energy consumed is equal to the calories eaten, weight loss will stop. Proximal GBP typically results in loss of 60&ndash;80% of '''excess''' body weight, and very rarely leads to excessive weight loss. The risk of excessive weight loss is slightly greater with distal GBP.

=====Vitamins=====
Vitamins are normally contained in foods and supplements. The amount of food eaten after GBP is severely reduced, and vitamin content is correspondingly lowered. Supplements should therefore be taken to complete minimum daily requirements of all vitamins and minerals. Pre-natal vitamins are sometimes suggested by doctors, as they contain more of certain vitamins than most multi-vitamins. Absorption of most vitamins is not seriously affected after proximal GBP, although vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may not be well-absorbed in some persons: sublingual preparations of B<sub>12</sub> provide adequate absorption. Some studies suggest that GBP patients who took [[probiotic]]s after surgery are able to absorb and retain higher amounts of B<sub>12</sub> than patients who did not take probiotics after surgery. After a distal GBP, fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E may not be well-absorbed, particularly if fat intake is large. Water-dispersed forms of these vitamins may be indicated on specific physician recommendation. For some patients, sublingual B<sub>12</sub> is not enough, and patients may require B<sub>12</sub> injections.

=====Minerals=====
All versions of the GBP bypass the duodenum, which is the primary site of absorption of both iron and calcium. Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, [[gluconate]], chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. [[Calcium carbonate|Calcium ''carbonate'']] preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200&nbsp;mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include [[vitamin K]] are sometimes recommended by doctors as a good way to get calcium.

=====Alcohol Metabolism=====
Post-operative gastric bypass patients develop a lowered tolerance for alcoholic beverages because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol at a faster rate than people who have not undergone the surgery. It also takes a post-operative patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 post-operative patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject drank a 5 oz. glass of red wine and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.<ref>{{Citation |author =, Hagedorn, J., Encarnancion, B., Brat, G., & Morton, J. |title=Does gastric bypass alter alcohol metabolism? |journal=Surgery for obesity and related disease |volume= 3 | pages= 543–548 |doi=10.101616/j.jpedsurg.2004.09.034 |postscript =. }}</ref>

=====Pica=====
There have been reported cases in which [[Pica (disorder)|pica]] recurs after gastric bypass in patients with a pre-operative history of the disorder or even a past urine test that may have failed because of vomiting during sexual intercourse, or are possibly due to iron deficiencies. Pica is a compulsive tendency to eat substances other than normal food.  Some examples would be people eating paper, clay, plaster, ashes, or ice. Low levels of iron and hemoglobin are common in patients who have undergone gastric bypass.{{http://www.news-medical.net/health/Gastric-Bypass-Complications.aspx}} 
One study reported on a female post-operative gastric bypass patient who was consuming eight to ten 32 oz. glasses of ice a day. The patient's blood test revealed iron levels of 2.3&nbsp;mmol/L and hemoglobin level of 5.83&nbsp;mmol/L. Normal iron blood levels of adult women are 30 to 126 ug/dL and normal hemoglobin levels are 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dl. This deficiency in the patient's iron levels may have led to the increase Pica activity.  The patient was then given iron supplements that brought her hemoglobin and iron blood levels to normal levels. After one month, the patient's eating diminished to two to three glasses of ice per day. After one year of taking iron supplements the patient's iron and hemoglobin levels remained in a normal range and the patient reported that she did not have any further cravings for ice.<ref>{{Citation |author =Kushner, R., Gleason, B., &Shanta-Retelny, V. |title=Reemergence of Pica following gstric bypass surgery for obesity: a new presentation of an old problem |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Åssociation |volume= 104 | pages= 1393–1397 |doi=10.101616/j.jada.2004.06.026 |postscript =. }}</ref>

== Results and health benefits of gastric bypass ==
Weight loss of 65&ndash;80% of excess body weight is typical of most large series of gastric bypass operations reported. The medically more significant effects are a dramatic reduction in comorbid conditions:
*[[Hyperlipidemia]] is corrected in over 70% of patients.
*[[Essential hypertension]] is relieved in over 70% of patients, and medication requirements are usually reduced in the remainder.
*[[Obstructive sleep apnea]] is markedly improved with weight loss and bariatric surgery may be curative for sleep apnea. Snoring also improves in most patients.
*[[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]] is reversed in up to 90% of patients [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10062/1039722-114.stm] usually leading to a normal blood sugar without medication, sometimes within days of surgery.<ref name="pmid7677463">{{Citation |author=Pories WJ, Swanson MS, MacDonald KG, ''et al.'' |title=Who would have thought it? An operation proves to be the most effective therapy for adult-onset diabetes mellitus |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=222 |issue=3 |pages=339–50; discussion 350–2 |year=1995 |month=September |pmid=7677463 |pmc=1234815 |doi= 10.1097/00000658-199509000-00011|url= |postscript=.}}</ref>
*[[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] is relieved in almost all patients.
*Venous thromboembolic disease signs such as leg swelling are typically alleviated.
*Lower back pain and joint pain are typically relieved or improved in nearly all patients.

A study in a large comparative series of patients showed an 89% reduction in mortality over the five years following surgery, compared to a non-surgically treated group of patients.

Concurrently, most patients are able to enjoy greater participation in family and social activities.

== Living with gastric bypass ==
Gastric bypass surgery has an emotional and physiological impact on the individual. Many who have undergone the surgery suffer from depression in the following months as a result of a change in the role food plays in their emotional well-being.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Elkins | first1 = G | last2 = Whitfield | first2 = P | last3 = Marcus | first3 = J | last4 = Symmonds | first4 = R | last5 = Rodriguez | first5= J | last6 = Cook | first6 = T | title = Noncompliance with behavioral recommendations following bariatric surgery | journal = Obesity Surgery | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15946436 | doi = 10.1381/0960892053723385 }}</ref> Strict limitations on the diet can place great emotional strain on the patient. Energy levels in the period following the surgery can be low, both due to the restriction of food intake and negative changes in emotional state.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Delin | first1 = CR | last2 = Watts| first2 = JM | last3 = Saebel | first3 = JL | last4 = Anderson | first4 = PG | title = Eating behavior and the experience of hunger following gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity | journal = Obesity Surgery | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 405–13 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9730494 | doi = 10.1381/096089297765555386 }}
</ref> It may take as long as three months for emotional levels to rebound. Muscular weakness in the months following surgery is also common. This is caused by a number of factors, including a restriction on protein intake, a resulting loss in muscle mass and decline in energy levels. Muscle weakness may result in balance problems, difficulty climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects, and increased fatigue following simple physical tasks. Many of these issues pass over time as food intake gradually increases. However, the first months following the surgery can be very difficult, an issue not often mentioned by physicians suggesting the surgery.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The benefits and risks of this surgery are well established; however, the psychological effects are not well understood.

Even if physical activity is increased patients may still harbor long term psychological effects due to excess skin and fat.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Often bypass surgery is followed up with "[[Belt lipectomy|body lifts]]" of skin and [[liposuction]] of fatty deposits. These extra surgeries have their own inherent risks but are even more dangerous when coupled with the typical nutritional deficiences that accompany convalescing gastric bypass patients.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
