The '''social construction theory of ADHD''' argues that [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is not necessarily a valid [[medical diagnosis]], but rather a [[socially constructed]] explanation to describe behaviors that are not genuinely [[pathological]], but rather simply don't meet prescribed [[social norms]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parens E, Johnston J|title=Facts, values, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): an update on the controversies |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1|year=2009 |pmid=19152690|pmc=2637252 |doi=10.1186/1753-2000-3-1 |url=}}</ref>  

Some proponents of the social construct theory of ADHD seem to regard the disorder as genuine, though over-diagnosed in some cultures. These proponents cite as evidence that the [[DSM IV]], favored in the United States for defining and diagnosing mental illness, arrives at levels of ADHD three to four times times higher than criteria in the [[ICD 10]], the diagnostic guide favored by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name="Singh I 2008 957–64">{{cite journal |author=Singh I |title=Beyond polemics: science and ethics of ADHD |journal=Nat.

==ADHD as a social construct==

Psychiatrists [[Peter Breggin]] and Sami Timimi oppose pathologizing the symptoms of ADHD. [[Sami Timimi]], who is an [[National Health Service|NHS]] child and adolescent psychiatrist, explains ADHD as a [[social construct]] rather than an objective 'disorder'.<ref>http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/184/1/8 (Timimi, 2002</ref> Timimi argues that western society creates stress on families which in turn suggests environmental causes for children expressing the symptoms of ADHD.<ref>Timimi, S. & Begum, M. (2006). Critical Voices in Child and Adolescent Mental Health. London: [[Free Association Books]].</ref> They also believe that parents who feel they have failed in their parenting responsibilities can use the ADHD label to absolve [[culpability|guilt]] and [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]]. A common argument against the medical model of ADHD asserts that while the traits that define ADHD exist and may be measurable, they lie within the spectrum of normal healthy human behaviour and are not dysfunctional. However, by definition, in order to diagnose with a mental disorder, symptoms must be interpreted as causing a person distress / espec. maladaptive.  In America, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) requires that "some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings" and that "there must be clear evidence of significant impairment in social, school, or work functioning" for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made.<ref>http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=7721</ref>

In this view, in societies where passivity and order are highly valued, those on the active end of the active-passive spectrum may be seen as 'problems'. Medically defining their behaviour (by giving labels such as ADHD and ADD) serves the purpose of removing blame from those 'causing the problem'. Controversy over the social constructionist view comes from a number of studies that cite significant psychological and social differences between those diagnosed with the disorder, and those who are not. However, the specific reasons for these differences are not certain, and this does not suggest anything other than a difference in behavior. Studies have also shown [[neurological]] differences, but whether this signifies an effect rather than a cause is unknown. Such differences could also be attributed the drugs commonly prescribed to people with this disorder. Studies have also been able to differentiate ADHD from other psychiatric disorders in its symptoms, associated features, 
life course, and comorbidity.<ref>Sami Timimi and Eric Taylor (2004) In Debate: ADHD is best understood as a cultural construct.

Gerald Coles, an educational psychologist and formerly an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the University of Rochester who has written extensively on literacy and learning disabilities, asserts that there are partisan agendas behind the educational policy-makers and that the scientific research that they use to support their arguments regarding the teaching of literacy are flawed. These include the idea that there are neurological explanations for learning disabilities. Gerald Coles argues that school failure must be viewed and treated in the context of both the learning environment and the child's individual abilities, behavior, family life, and social relationships. He then presents a new model of learning problems, in which family and school environments are the major determinants of academic success. In this "interactive" paradigm, the attitudes and methods of education are more important than inherent strengths or deficits of the individual child.<ref>Gerald Coles (1987).

===Questioning the pathophysiological and genetic basis of ADHD===
{{Dablink|See also: [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Cause|Causes]]{{·}} [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]{{·}} [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies#ADHD as a biological illness|ADHD as a biological illness]]}}
Some social constructionist theories of ADHD reject the dominant medical opinion that ADHD has a distinct pathophysiology and genetic components.  The "symptoms" of ADHD also happen to be morally questionable attributes, this is why the symptoms as described as "inappropriate".  Many social constructionists trenchantly question deterministic views of behaviour, such as those views sometimes put forth within behavioural/abnormal psychology and the biological sciences.

Currently, the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|pathophysiology]] of ADHD is unclear; although research has found evidence of differences in the brain between ADHD and non-ADHD patients.<ref>[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/brain-matures-a-few-years-late-in-adhd-but-follows-normal-pattern.shtml Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD, But Follows Normal Pattern] NIMH Press Release, November 12, 2007</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lou HC, Andresen J, Steinberg B, McLaughlin T, Friberg L | year = 1998 | month = Jan | title = The striatum in a putative cerebral network activated by verbal awareness in normals and in ADHD children | url = | journal = Eur J Neurol | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 67–74 | doi = 10.1046/j.1468-1331.1998.510067.x | pmid = 10210814 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/gene-predicts-better-outcome-as-cortex-normalizes-in-teens-with-adhd.shtml Gene Predicts Better Outcome as Cortex Normalizes in Teens with ADHD] NIMH Press Release, August 6, 2007</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dougherty DD, Bonab AA, Spencer TJ, Rauch SL, Madras BK, Fischman AJ |title=Dopamine transporter density in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9196 |pages=2132––33 |year=1999 |pmid=10609822 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04030-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dresel SH, Kung MP, Plössl K, Meegalla SK, Kung HF |title=Pharmacological effects of dopaminergic drugs on in vivo binding of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 to the central dopamine transporters in rats |journal=European journal of nuclear medicine |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=31–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9396872}}</ref><ref name="pmid17113158">{{cite journal |author=Coccaro EF, Hirsch SL, Stein MA |title=Plasma homovanillic acid correlates inversely with history of learning problems in healthy volunteer and personality disordered subjects |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=149 |issue=1–3 |pages=297–302 |year=2007 |pmid=17113158 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.009}}</ref> Critics, such as Jonathan Leo and David Cohen who reject the characterization of ADHD as a disorder, contend that the controls for stimulant medication usage were inadequate in some lobar volumetric studies which makes it impossible to determine whether ADHD itself or [[psychotropic]] medication used to treat ADHD is responsible for decreased thickness observed<ref>{{cite journal |author=Philip Shaw, MD; Jason Lerch, PhD; Deanna Greenstein, PhD; Wendy Sharp, MSW; Liv Clasen, PhD; Alan Evans, PhD; Jay Giedd, MD; F.

From a biological/genetic point of view, ADHD is said to be highly heritable and twin studies suggest genetics are a factor in about 75% of ADHD cases,.<ref name="Barkley">{{cite web|url=http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course003.php|title=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Nature, Course, Outcomes, and Comorbidity|last=Barkley|first=Russel A.|accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> However, the genetic connection is questionable. Dr. Joseph Glenmullen states, "no claim of a gene for a psychiatric condition has stood the test of time, in spite of popular misinformation.

Authors of a review of ADHD etiology have noted: "Although several genome-wide searches have identified chromosomal regions that are predicted to contain genes that contribute to ADHD susceptibility, to date no single gene with a major contribution to ADHD has been identified."<ref>{{cite journal | author=M.

===Alternatives to medication===

Social critics question if environmental changes should be the main line of treatment for those with a diagnosis of ADHD, instead of the medical model which  predominantly uses medication and to a lesser extent, [[behavior modification]]. Critics believe schools and the health system force children to conform to a narrow, predefined standard of [[child development]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} These critics believe that these institutions are propagating the dangerous viewpoint that children with ADHD are maladaptive and disabled simply because they do not conform to a socially constructed norm.{{Who|date=April 2008}} Some people including retired neurologist and [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]] medical expert [[Fred Baughman]] have suggested that this viewpoint is ultimately being pushed by the pharmaceutical industry in order to sell Anti-ADHD drugs.<ref>[http://www.adhdfraud.org/ adhdfraud.org]</ref> Moreover, the argument against ADHD asserts that changing the child through medication regimes may cheat them of certain unique and positive personal characteristics that in turn may limit our collective future. 

===Sudbury model of democratic education schools' alternative===

Some critics of the concept of [[learning disabilities]] and of [[special education]] take the position that every child has a different [[learning styles|learning style]] and pace and that each child is [[Individual differences psychology|unique]], not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding.  These critics assert that applying the medical model of problem-solving to individual children who are pupils in the school system, and labeling these children as disabled, systematically prevents the improvement of the current educational system.  

Describing current instructional methods as [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the  [[Sudbury model|Sudbury model of democratic education]] schools, an alternative approach in which children, by [[Sudbury model#Individual_freedom.2C_freedom_of_choice.2C_learning_and_learning_through_experience|enjoying personal freedom]] thus [[Sudbury model#Discipline|encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions]], [[Literacy#Criticism_of_the_concept_of_teaching_literacy|learn at their own pace]] rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum.<ref>Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America, A View from Sudbury Valley, ''"Special Education" -- A noble Cause Sacrificed to Standardization''.</ref><ref>Greenberg, D.

(1987), Free at Last, The Sudbury Valley School, Chapter 19, ''Learning''.</ref> Proponents of [[unschooling]] have also claimed that children raised in this method do not suffer from learning disabilities.

===Criticism===

Critics of the social constructionist view contend that it presents no hard evidence in support of its own position. Proponents of this view disagree that criteria for falsifiability are lacking. One way, for example, is to show that there exists an objective characteristic possessed by virtually ''all'' diagnosed individuals which does not exist in ''any'' non-diagnosed individual. However, because diagnosis of psychiatric disorders is based on opinion, this would be difficult to prove. Also, whether this would demonstrate any actual abnormality as opposed to the labeling of certain behaviors is unknown. Current candidates for falsifiability include PET scans, [[gene]]s, neuroanatomical differences, and life outcomes. However, none of these have been shown to be precise predictors of a diagnosis or lack thereof. Also, as previously stated, neurological differences do not indicate a cause, nor do genes indicate a direct impact.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Such criteria are generally fulfilled by well-understood medical diseases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

Critics of this view also assert that it is not consistent with known findings. For instance, they claim that ADHD is as frequent in Japan and China as in the US{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, yet in such societies (which supposedly favor child obedience and passivity) one would expect higher rates of ADHD if this theory were correct.{{Clarify|article|date=March 2008}} However, this is also disputed on the grounds that more aggressively obedient societies may suppress 'symptoms' of rebellion or 'ADHD'. The style in which individuals of these nationalities interact in their home countries, which is typically much more reserved and serious than in the United States, seems to suggest this{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. However, there is no solid proof of this assertion.  Additionally, rates of medical diagnoses in China cannot be a reliable indicator of ADHD prevalence, especially for such non-life-threatening disorders as ADHD, due to the large peasant population in that country who cannot easily seek the services of a trained child psychologist. Timimi's view has been seriously criticized by Russell Barkley and numerous experts in Child and Family Psychology Review (2005). In any case, it has been shown that Chinese and Indonesian clinicians give significantly higher scores for hyperactive-disruptive behaviors than did their Japanese and American colleagues when evaluating the same group of children.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E.
