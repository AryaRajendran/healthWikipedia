'''Macrencephaly''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "makros" - big, large and "enkephalos" - [[brain]]) is a condition present at or soon after birth in which the brain is abnormally large. Generally this is the case when its measures are statistically more than 97% of the population.

The brain can become larger due to certain diseases like [[Alexander disease]], later phases of the [[Tay-Sachs disease]], and spongy degeneration of infancy. The large growth of the brain is usually not caused by the formation of [[tumor]]s. 

Macrencephaly is also known as '''macrencephalia''' and '''macroencephaly'''.
