'''Androgen insensitivity syndrome''' (AIS) is a condition that results in the partial or complete inability of the [[Animal cell|cell]] to respond to [[androgen]]s.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones can impair or prevent the [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|masculinization of male genitalia]] in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male [[Secondary sex characteristics|secondary sexual characteristics]] at [[puberty]], but does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" />  As such, the insensitivity to androgens is clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]], or more specifically, an [[SRY|SRY gene]]).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  Clinical [[phenotypes]] in these individuals range from a normal [[body shape|male habitus]] with mild [[spermatogenesis|spermatogenic]] defect or reduced secondary [[terminal hair]], to a full [[Female body shape|female habitus]], despite the presence of a Y-chromosome.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2001 giwercman 54" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" />

AIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|genital masculinization]]: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome ([[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome|CAIS]]) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; mild androgen insensitivity syndrome ([[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome|MAIS]]) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome ([[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome|PAIS]]) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /><ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /><ref name="2005 kawate 90" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY [[Intersexuality#Conditions|undermasculinized genitalia]].<ref name="1999 ahmed 80" />

==Signs and symptoms==
AIS is broken down into three classes based on [[phenotype]]: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /><ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /><ref name="2005 kawate 90" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />  A supplemental system of phenotypic grading that uses seven classes instead of the traditional three was proposed by pediatric [[endocrinologist]] Charmian A. Quigley et al. in 1995.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The first six grades of the scale, grades 1 through 6, are differentiated by the degree of [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|genital masculinization]]; grade 1 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully masculinized, grade 6 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully feminized, and grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of decreasingly masculinized genitalia that lie in the interim.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Grade 7 is indistinguishable from grade 6 until puberty, and is thereafter differentiated by the presence of [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary]] [[terminal hair]]; grade 6 is indicated when secondary terminal hair is present, whereas grade 7 is indicated when it is absent.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The Quigley scale can be used in conjunction with the traditional three classes of AIS to provide additional information regarding the degree of genital masculinization, and is particularly useful when the diagnosis is PAIS.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2001 sultan 7" />

==Genetics==
[[File:Functional domains of the human androgen receptor.svg|thumb|200px|Location and structure of the human androgen receptor. '''Top''', The AR gene is located on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome. '''Middle''', The eight exons are separated by introns of various lengths. '''Bottom''', Illustration of the AR protein, with primary functional domains labeled (not representative of actual 3-D structure).<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />]]

The human [[androgen receptor]] (AR) is a [[protein]] encoded by a [[gene]] located on the [[proximal]] [[Locus (genetics)|long arm]] of the [[X chromosome]] ([[Locus (genetics)|locus]] Xq11-Xq12).<ref name="1989 brown 44" />  The [[Gene#Functional structure of a gene|protein coding region]] consists of approximately 2,757 [[nucleotides]] (919 [[codons]]) spanning eight [[exons]], designated 1-8 or A-H.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  [[Introns]] vary in size between 0.7 and 26 [[Base pair#Length measurements|kb]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Like other nuclear receptors, the androgen receptor protein consists of several [[protein domain|functional domains]]: the [[transactivation]] domain (also called the transcription-regulation domain or the amino / [[N-terminus|NH2-terminal]] domain), the [[DNA-binding domain]], the hinge region, and the steroid-binding domain (also called the [[C-terminus|carboxyl-terminal]] [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand-binding]] domain).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />  The transactivation domain is encoded by exon 1, and makes up more than half of the AR protein.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Exons 2 and 3 encode the DNA-binding domain, while the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5′-end|5']] portion of exon 4 encodes the hinge region.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The remainder of exon 4 through exon 8 encodes the ligand binding domain.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

===Trinucleotide satellite lengths and AR transcriptional activity===
The [[androgen receptor]] gene contains two [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetic polymorphism|polymorphic]] [[nucleotide|trinucleotide]] [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] in exon 1.<ref name="2008 galani 7" />  The first microsatellite (nearest the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5′-end|5']] end) contains 8 <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> to 60 <ref name="2002 dejager 87" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /> repetitions of the [[glutamine]] [[codon]] "CAG" and is thus known as the [[polyglutamine tract]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The second microsatellite contains 4 <ref name="2010 audi 95" /> to 31 <ref name="1997 lumbroso 101" /> repetitions of the [[glycine]] codon "GGC" and is known as the [[polyglycine tract]].<ref name="1999 gottlieb 89" />  The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18.<ref name="1992 edwards 12" />  In men, disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; [[prostate cancer]],<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> [[hepatocellular carcinoma]],<ref name="2007 yeh 120" /> and [[mental retardation]] <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> are associated with too few repetitions, while [[spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy]] (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more.<ref name="1991 la spada 352" />  Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional activity]] in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with [[infertility|male infertility]] <ref name="2003 casella 169" /><ref name="1999 dowsing 354" /><ref name="1997 tut 82" /> and [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|undermasculinized genitalia]] in men.<ref name="2000 lim 9" />  However, other studies have indicated that no such correlation exists.<ref name="2000 hiort 85" /><ref name="2002 kukuvitis 25" /><ref name="2001 von eckardstein 86" /><ref name="2002 rajpert-de meyts 359" /><ref name="1999 hiort 354" /><ref name="2001 muroya 7" />  A comprehensive [[meta-analysis]] of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded that these discrepancies could be resolved when [[sample size]] and study design are taken into account.<ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" />  Some studies suggest that longer polyglycine tract lengths are also associated with genital masculinization defects in men.<ref name="2007 radpour 28" /><ref name="2004 aschim 89" />  Other studies find no such association.<ref name="2006 rajender 27" />

===AR mutations===
As of 2010, over 400 [[androgen receptor|AR]] [[mutations]] have been reported in the AR mutation database, and the number continues to grow.<ref name="2008 galani 7" />  [[heredity|Inheritance]] is typically maternal and follows an [[X-linked recessive]] pattern;<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2001 gottlieb 17" /> individuals with a [[karyotype|46,XY karyotype]] will always express the mutant gene since they only have one [[X chromosome]], whereas 46,XX carriers will be minimally affected.  30% of the time, the AR mutation is a spontaneous result, and is not inherited.<ref name="2010 ozulker 24" />  Such [[de novo mutation]]s are the result of a [[germ cell]] mutation or [[Mosaic (genetics)|germ cell mosaicism]] in the [[gonads]] of one of the parents, or a mutation in the [[zygote|fertilized egg]] itself.<ref name="2005 kohler 90" />  In one study,<ref name="1998 hiort 132" /> it was found that 3 out of 8 de novo mutations occurred in the post-zygotic stage, leading to the estimate that up to one third of de novo mutations result in [[Mosaic (genetics)|somatic mosaicism]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  It is worthwhile to note that not every mutation of the AR gene results in androgen insensitivity; one particular mutation occurs in 8 to 14 percent of [[karyotype|genetic males]],<ref name="1992 batch 1" /><ref name="1994 hiort 153" /><ref name="1996 lu 49" /><ref name="1993 macke 53" /> and is thought to adversely affect only a small number of individuals when other genetic factors are present.<ref name="1999 gottlieb 14" />

===Other causes===
Some individuals with CAIS or PAIS do not have any [[androgen receptor|AR]] [[mutations]] despite clinical, hormonal, and [[histological]] features sufficient to warrant an AIS diagnosis; up to 5% of women with CAIS do not have an AR mutation,<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> as well as between 27% <ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /> and 72% <ref name="2000 ahmed 85" /> of individuals with PAIS.

In one patient, it was shown that the underlying cause for presumptive PAIS was a mutant [[steroidogenic factor 1|steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)]] protein.<ref name="2007 coutant 92" />  In another patient, it was shown that CAIS was the result of a deficit in the transmission of a [[transactivation|transactivating]] signal from the [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] region of the normal androgen receptor to the [[Transcriptional regulation#Regulation of transcription machinery|basal transcription machinery]] of the cell.<ref name="2000 adachi 343" />  It was suggested that a [[coactivator]] protein interacting with the [[activation function 1]] (AF-1) [[transactivation]] domain of the androgen receptor was deficient in this patient.<ref name="2000 adachi 343" />  The signal disruption could not be corrected by supplementation with any coactivators known at the time, nor was the absent coactivator protein characterized, which left some in the field unconvinced that a mutant coactivator would explain the mechanism of androgen resistance in CAIS or PAIS patients with a normal AR gene.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

===XY karyotype===
Depending on the [[mutation]], a person with a ([[karyotype|46,XY karyotype]]) and AIS can have either a male (MAIS) or female (CAIS) [[phenotype]],<ref name="1999 ghadessy 103" /> or may have genitalia that is only partially [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|masculinized]] (PAIS).<ref name="2003 giwercman 61" />  The gonads are [[testes]] regardless of phenotype due to the influence of the Y-chromosome.<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" />  A 46,XY female thus does not have [[ovaries]] or a [[uterus]],<ref name="1996 brinkmann 61" /> and can neither contribute an [[ovum|egg]] towards conception nor [[gestate]] a child.

Several case studies of [[fertility|fertile]] 46,XY males with androgen insensitivity have been published,<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1988 grino 66" /><ref name="1994 tsukada 79" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" /> although this group is thought to be a minority.<ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />  Additionally, some [[male infertility|infertile]] males with MAIS have been able to conceive children after increasing their [[sperm count]] through the use of supplementary [[testosterone]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1994 yong 344" />  A genetic male conceived by a man with androgen insensitivity would not receive his father's [[X chromosome]], and thus would neither [[heredity|inherit]] nor carry the gene for the syndrome.  A genetic female conceived in such a way would receive her father's X chromosome, and would thus become a [[X-linked recessive inheritance|carrier]].

===XX karyotype===
Genetic females ([[karyotype|46,XX karyotype]]) have two [[X chromosomes]], and thus have two [[androgen receptor|AR]] [[genes]].  A [[mutation]] in one (but not both) of the AR genes results in a minimally affected, [[fertility|fertile]], female [[X-linked recessive inheritance|carrier]].  Some carriers have been noted to have slightly reduced body hair, delayed puberty, and / or tall stature, presumably due to skewed [[X-inactivation]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" />  A female carrier will pass the affected AR gene to her children 50% of the time.  If the affected child is a genetic female, she too will be a carrier.  An affected 46,XY child will have androgen insensitivity syndrome.

A genetic female with mutations in both AR genes could theoretically result from the union of a fertile man with androgen insensitivity and a female carrier of the [[gene]], or from [[Mutation|de novo]] mutation.  However, given the scarcity of fertile androgen insensitive men and low [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of AR mutation, the chances of this occurrence is small.  The [[phenotype]] of such an individual is a matter of speculation; as of 2010, no such documented case has been published.

===Correlation of genotype and phenotype===
Individuals with partial androgen insensitivity, unlike those with the complete or mild forms, present at birth with [[ambiguous genitalia]], and the decision to raise the child as male or female is often not obvious.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2005 kohler 90" /><ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" />  Unfortunately, it is often the case that little information regarding [[phenotype]] can be gleaned from precise knowledge of the [[androgen receptor|AR]] [[mutation]] itself; it is well established that the same AR mutation may cause significant variation in the degree of [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|masculinization]] in different individuals, even among members of the same family.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2001 gottlieb 17" /><ref name="2003 giwercman 61" /><ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /><ref name="1997 evans 76" /><ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="1997 radmayr 158" /><ref name="2005 deeb 63" /><ref name="1996 rodien 81" /><ref name="1998 nordenskjold 11" />  Exactly what causes this variation is not entirely understood, although factors contributing to it could include the lengths of the [[polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]] and [[polyglycine tract|polyglycine]] tracts,<ref name="2006 werner 91" /> sensitivity to and variations in the [[intrauterine]] [[endocrine]] milieu,<ref name="2003 giwercman 61" /> the effect of [[Transcription coregulator|coregulatory]] proteins that are active in [[Sertoli cells]],<ref name="1999 gottlieb 89" /><ref name="2002 zenteno 57" /> [[Mosaic (genetics)|somatic mosaicism]],<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> expression of the [[5-alpha reductase|5RD2]] [[gene]] in genital skin [[fibroblasts]],<ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /> reduced AR [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] from factors other than mutations in the AR coding region,<ref name="2005 holterhus 83" /> an unidentified [[Coactivator (genetics)|coactivator]] protein,<ref name="2000 adachi 343" /> enzyme deficiencies such as [[21-hydroxylase deficiency]],<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /> or other genetic variations such as a mutant [[steroidogenic factor 1|steroidogenic factor-1]] (SF-1) protein.<ref name="2007 coutant 92" />  The degree of variation, however, does not appear to be constant across all AR mutations, and is much more extreme in some.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="1999 gottlieb 14" /><ref name="2003 giwercman 61" />  [[Missense mutations]] that result in a single [[amino acid]] substitution are known to produce the most phenotypic diversity.<ref name="2008 galani 7" />

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Human androgen receptor and androgen binding.svg|thumb|Normal function of the androgen receptor. Testosterone (T) enters the cell and, if 5-alpha-reductase is present, is converted into dihydrotestone (DHT). Upon steroid binding, the androgen receptor (AR) undergoes a conformational change and releases heat shock proteins (hsps). Phosphorylation (P) occurs before or after steroid binding. The AR translocates to the nucleus where dimerization, DNA binding, and the recruitment of coactivators occur. Target genes are transcribed (mRNA) and translated into proteins.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /><ref name="2003 meehan 8" />]]

===Androgens and the androgen receptor===
{{Main|Androgen receptor}}
The [[Androgen#Functions|effects]] that [[androgens]] have on the human body --- [[Puberty#Physical changes in boys|virilization]], [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|masculinization]], [[anabolism]], etc. --- are not brought about by androgens themselves, but rather are the result of androgens bound to [[androgen receptor]]s; the androgen receptor mediates the effects of androgens in the human body.<ref name="1998 wang 83" />  Likewise, under normal circumstances, the androgen receptor itself is inactive in the cell until androgen binding occurs.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

The following series of steps illustrates how androgens and the androgen receptor work together to produce [[Androgen#Functions|androgenic effects]]:<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /><ref name="2005 taneja 280" /><ref name="2002 heinlein 23" />

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
   <li>Androgen enters the cell.</li>
   <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
      <li>Only certain organs in the body, such as the [[gonads]] and the [[adrenal glands]], produce the androgen [[testosterone]].</li>

      <li>These heat shock proteins are released upon androgen binding.
      <li>Androgen binding induces a stabilizing, [[Chemical structure|conformational]] change in the androgen receptor.
      <li>The two [[zinc fingers]] of the [[DNA-binding domain]] are exposed as a result of this new conformation.
      <li>AR stability is thought to be aided by type II [[Transcription coregulator|coregulators]], which modulate [[protein folding]] and androgen binding, or facilitate NH2/carboxyl-terminal interaction.

   <li>Target [[gene transcription]] ensues.
</ol>

In this way, androgens bound to androgen receptors [[Regulation of gene expression|regulate the expression]] of target [[genes]], and thus produce [[Androgen#Functions|androgenic effects]].

It is theoretically possible for certain [[mutation|mutant]] androgen receptors to function without androgens; in vitro studies have demonstrated that a mutant androgen receptor protein can induce transcription in the absence of androgen if its steroid binding domain is deleted.<ref name="1991 jenster 5" /><ref name="1991 simental 266" />  Conversely, the steroid-binding domain may act to repress the AR [[transactivation]] domain, perhaps due to the AR's [[Ligand (biochemistry)|unliganded]] conformation.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

[[File:Human sexual differentiation.gif|thumb|Sexual differentiation. The human embryo has indifferent sex accessory ducts until the seventh week of development.<ref name="2000 gilbert" />]]

===Androgens in fetal development===
[[Human embryos]] develop similarly for the first six weeks, regardless of genetic sex (46,XX or 46,XY [[karyotype]]); the only way to tell the difference between 46,XX or 46,XY embryos during this time period is to look for [[Barr bodies]] or a Y-chromosome.<ref name="2006 jones" />  The [[gonads]] begin as bulges of tissue called the [[gonadal ridge|genital ridges]] at the back of the [[abdominal cavity]], near the midline.  By the fifth week, the genital ridges [[sexual differentiation|differentiate]] into an outer [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] and an inner [[wiktionary:medulla|medulla]], and are called [[Development of the gonads|indifferent gonads]].<ref name="2006 jones" />  By the sixth week, the indifferent gonads begin to differentiate according to genetic sex.  If the karyotype is 46,XY, [[testes]] develop due to the influence of the [[Y chromosome]]’s [[SRY gene]].<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" />  This process does not require the presence of [[androgen]], nor a functional [[androgen receptor]].<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" />

Until approximately the seventh week of development, the embryo has indifferent [[Sex_determination_and_differentiation_(human) | sex accessory ducts]], which consist of two pairs of ducts: the [[Müllerian ducts]] and the [[Wolffian ducts]].<ref name="2006 jones" />  The testes secrete [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] around this time to suppress the development of the Müllerian ducts, and cause their degeneration.<ref name="2006 jones" />  Without this anti-Müllerian hormone, the Müllerian ducts develop into the [[female internal genitalia]] ([[uterus]], [[cervix]], [[fallopian tubes]], and [[Vagina#Human anatomy|upper vaginal barrel]]).<ref name="2006 jones" />  Unlike the Müllerian ducts, the Wolffian ducts will not continue to develop by default.<ref name="2003 yong 9" />  In the presence of [[testosterone]] and functional androgen receptors, the Wolffian ducts develop into the [[epididymis|epididymides]], [[vas deferens|vasa deferentia]], and [[seminal vesicles]].<ref name="2006 jones" />  If the testes fail to secrete testosterone, or the androgen receptors do not function properly, the Wolffian ducts degenerate.<ref name="2004 hannema 89" />

[[File:Androgen dependencies of male genital tissues.gif|thumb|Masculinization of the male genitalia is dependent on both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.<ref name="2000 gilbert" />]]
[[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|Masculinization]] of the [[male external genitalia|external genitalia]] (the [[penis]], penile [[urethra]], and [[scrotum]]), as well as the [[prostate]], are dependent on the androgen [[dihydrotestosterone]].<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="1999 roy 55" /><ref name="1999 kokontis 55" /><ref name="2009 rajender 91" />  Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone by the [[5-alpha reductase]] [[enzyme]].<ref name="2006 sobel 91" />  If this enzyme is absent or deficient, then dihydrotestosterone will not be created, and the external male genitalia will not develop properly.<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="1999 roy 55" /><ref name="1999 kokontis 55" /><ref name="2009 rajender 91" /><ref name="2006 sobel 91" />  As is the case with the [[male internal genitalia|internal male genitalia]], a functional androgen receptor is needed in order for dihydrotestosterone to regulate the [[gene transcription|transcription of target genes]] involved in development.<ref name="1998 wang 83" />

[[Mutations]] in the [[androgen receptor]] gene can cause problems with any of the steps involved in androgenization, from the synthesis of the androgen receptor protein itself, through the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional ability]] of the [[Protein dimer|dimerized]], androgen-AR complex.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  AIS can result if even one of these steps is significantly disrupted, as each step is required in order for androgens to successfully activate the AR and [[regulation of gene expression|regulate gene expression]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Exactly which steps a particular mutation will impair can be predicted, to some extent, by identifying the area of the AR in which the mutation resides.  This predictive ability is primarily retrospective in origin; the different [[protein domain|functional domains]] of the AR gene have been elucidated by analyzing the effects of specific mutations in different regions of the AR.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  For example, mutations in the steroid binding domain have been known to affect [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|androgen binding affinity or retention]], mutations in the hinge region have been known to affect [[Protein targeting#Protein translocation|nuclear translocation]], mutations in the [[DNA-binding domain]] have been known to affect dimerization and binding to target DNA, and mutations in the [[transactivation]] domain have been known to affect target gene transcription regulation.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2003 yong 9" />  Unfortunately, even when the affected functional domain is known, it is difficult to predict the [[phenotype|phenotypical]] consequences of a particular mutation (see [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome#Correlation of genotype and phenotype|Correlation of genotype and phenotype]]).

Some mutations can adversely impact more than one functional domain.  For example, a mutation in one functional domain can have deleterious effects on another by altering the way in which the domains interact.<ref name="2003 yong 9" />  A single mutation can affect all [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] functional domains if a [[nonsense mutation|premature stop codon]] or [[frameshift mutation|framing error]] results; such a mutation can result in a completely unusable (or unsynthesizable) androgen receptor protein.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The steroid binding domain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a premature stop codon or framing error, since it occurs at the end of the [[gene]], and its information is thus more likely to be truncated or misinterpreted than other functional domains.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

Other, more complex relationships have been observed as a consequence of mutated AR; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to [[male breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], or in the case of [[spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy]], disease of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="2003 lund 79" /><ref name="2001 casella 58" /><ref name="1992 wooster 2" /><ref name="1996 evans 28" /><ref name="1993 lobaccaro 2" />  The form of breast cancer that is seen in some men with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by a mutation in the AR's DNA-binding domain.<ref name="1992 wooster 2" /><ref name="1993 lobaccaro 2" />  It has been hypothesized that this mutation causes a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the [[estrogen receptor]] protein, to cause [[neoplasm|cancerous growth]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The [[etiology]] of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in [[pathology]].  The [[trinucleotide repeat disorder|trinucleotide repeat expansion]] of the [[polyglutamine tract]] of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a [[misfolded]] AR protein that the cell fails to properly [[Proteolysis|proteolyze]] and disperse.<ref name="1999 stenoien 8" />  These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].<ref name="1999 stenoien 8" />  Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] effect, eventually resulting in the [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] symptoms associated with SBMA.<ref name="1999 stenoien 8" />

==Diagnosis==
The [[phenotypes]] that result from the insensitivity to androgens are not unique to AIS, and thus the diagnosis of AIS requires thorough exclusion of other causes.<ref name="1999 ahmed 80" /><ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" />  Clinical findings indicative of AIS include the presence of a short vagina <ref name="2007 ismail-pratt 22" /> or undermasculinized genitalia,<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1997 evans 76" /><ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> partial or complete regression of Müllerian structures,<ref name="2009 nichols 91" /> bilateral [[Dysplastic|nondysplastic]] testes,<ref name="2006 hannema 208" /> and impaired [[spermatogenesis]] and / or [[Puberty#Physical changes in boys|virilization]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" />  Laboratory findings include a [[karyotype|46,XY karyotype]] <ref name="2008 galani 7" /> and normal or elevated postpubertal [[testosterone]], [[luteinizing hormone]], and [[estradiol]] levels.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1999 ahmed 80" />  The androgen binding activity of genital skin [[fibroblasts]] is typically diminished,<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1996 weidemann 45" /> although exceptions have been reported.<ref name="2008 deeb 93" />  Conversion of testosterone to [[dihydrotestosterone]] may be impaired.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The diagnosis of AIS is confirmed if [[androgen receptor]] [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] reveals a [[mutation]], although not all individuals with AIS (particularly PAIS) will have an AR mutation (see [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome#Other causes|Other Causes]]).<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /><ref name="2000 ahmed 85" />

==History==
Recorded descriptions of the effects of androgen insensitivity syndrome date back for hundreds of years, although significant understanding of its underlying [[histopathology]] would not occur until the 1950s.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[nomenclature]] associated with androgen insensitivity went through a significant evolution that paralleled this understanding.

</ol>

===Early terminology===
The first descriptions of the effects of androgen insensitivity appeared in the [[medical literature]] as individual [[case reports]] or as part of a comprehensive description of [[intersex]] physicalities.  In 1839, Scottish obstetrician [[James Young Simpson|Sir James Young Simpson]] published one such description <ref name="1839 simpson" /> in an exhaustive study of intersexuality that has been credited with advancing the medical community's understanding of the subject.<ref name="2007 king" />  Simpson's system of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], however, was far from the first; taxonomies / descriptions for the classification of intersexuality were developed by Italian physician and physicist Fortuné Affaitati in 1549,<ref name="1549 affaitati" /><ref name="1820 panckoucke 1" /> French surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] in 1573,<ref name="2007 king" /><ref name="1573 pare" /> French physician and sexology pioneer [[Nicolas Venette]] in 1687 (under the pseudonym Vénitien Salocini),<ref name="1687 venette" /><ref name="1718 jacob" /> and French Zoologist [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire]] in 1832.<ref name="1832 st. hilaire" />  All five of the aforementioned authors used the colloquial term "[[Hermaphrodite#Other uses of the term|hermaphrodite]]" as the foundation of their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]], although Simpson himself questioned the propriety of the word in his publication.<ref name="1839 simpson" />  Use of the word "hermaphrodite" in the medical literature has persisted to this day,<ref name="2009 dorsey 73" /><ref name="2007 verkauskas 177" /> although its propriety is still in question.  An alternative system of [[nomenclature]] has been recently suggested,<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> but the subject of exactly which word or words should be used in its place still one of much debate.<ref name="2008 hughes 22" /><ref name="2007 simmonds 92" /><ref name="2010 zannoni 29" /><ref name="2008 federer 38" /><ref name="2007 reis 50" />

[[File:Pudenda pseudohermaphroditi.jpg|thumb|"Pudenda pseudo-hermaphroditi ovini." Illustration of ambiguous genitalia from Frederik Ruysch’s ''Thesaurus Anitomicus Octavius'', 1709.<ref name="1709 ruysch 8" />]]

===Pseudohermaphroditism===
"[[Pseudohermaphroditism]]" has, until very recently,<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> been the term used in the [[medical literature]] to describe the condition of an individual whose [[gonads]] and [[karyotype]] do not match the [[external genitalia]] in the [[gender binary]] sense.  For example, [[karyotype|46,XY]] individuals who have a female [[phenotype]], but also have [[testes]] instead of [[ovaries]] --- a group that includes all individuals with complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS), as well as some individuals with partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS) --- are classified as having "male pseudohermaphroditism," while individuals with both an ovary and a testis (or at least one ovotestis) are classified as having "[[true hermaphroditism]].".<ref name="2007 verkauskas 177" /><ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Usage of the word in the medical literature predates the discovery of the [[chromosome]], and thus its definition has not always taken karyotype into account when determining an individual's sex.  Previous definitions of "pseudohermaphroditism" relied on perceived inconsistencies between the internal and external organs; the "true" sex of an individual was determined by the internal organs, and the external organs determined the "perceived" sex of an individual.<ref name="1839 simpson" /><ref name="1832 st. hilaire" />

German-Swiss pathologist [[Edwin Klebs]] is sometimes noted for using the word "pseudohermaphroditism" in his [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[intersex]]uality in 1876,<ref name="1876 klebs" /> although the word is clearly not his invention as is sometimes reported; the history of the word "[[pseudohermaphrodite]]," and the corresponding desire to separate [[true hermaphrodite|"true" hermaphrodites]] from "false," "spurious," or "pseudo" hermaphrodites, dates back to at least 1709, when Dutch [[anatomist]] [[Frederik Ruysch]] used it in a publication describing a subject with [[testes]] and a mostly female phenotype.<ref name="1709 ruysch 8" />  "Pseudohermaphrodite" also appeared in the [[Acta Eruditorum]] later that same year, in a review of Ruysch's work.<ref name="1709 mencke 28" />  There is also evidence that the word was already being used by the German and French medical community long before Klebs used it; German [[physiologist]] [[Johannes Peter Müller]] equated "pseudohermaphroditism" with a sub-class of hermaphroditism from [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire's]] taxonomy in a publication dated 1834,<ref name="1834 muller" /> and by the 1840s "pseudo-hermaphroditism" was appearing in several French and German publications, including dictionaries.<ref name="1843 academie francaise" /><ref name="1840 ritter von raimann 22" /><ref name="1815 bertuch" /><ref name="1859 peschier" />

===Testicular feminization===
In 1953, American [[gynecologist]] John Morris provided the first full description of what he called "testicular feminization syndrome" based on 82 cases compiled from the [[medical literature]], including 2 of his own patients.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1953 morris 65" />  The term "testicular feminization" was coined to reflect Morris' observation that the testicles in these patients produced a hormone that had a feminizing effect on the body, a phenomenon that is now understood to be due to the inaction of [[androgens]], and subsequent [[aromatization]] of [[testosterone]] into [[estrogen]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  A few years before Morris published his landmark paper, [[Lawson Wilkins]] had shown through his own experiments that unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones was a cause of "male [[pseudohermaphroditism]]".<ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="1950 wilkins" />  Wilkins' work, which clearly demonstrated the lack of a therapeutic effect when [[karyotype|46,XY]] women were treated with [[androgens]], caused a gradual shift in nomenclature from "testicular feminization" to "androgen resistance".<ref name="2008 oakes 21" />

===Other names===
A distinct name has been given to many of the various presentations of androgen insensitivity syndrome, such as Reifenstein syndrome (1947),<ref name="1947 reifenstein 3" /> Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome (1948),<ref name="1948 goldberg 8" /> Morris' syndrome (1953),<ref name="1953 morris 65" /> Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome (1957),<ref name="1957 gilbert-dreyfus 18" /> Lub's syndrome (1959),<ref name="1959 lubs 19" /> "incomplete testicular feminization" (1963),<ref name="1963 morris 87" /> Rosewater syndrome (1965),<ref name="1965 rosewater 63" /> and Aiman's syndrome (1979).<ref name="1979 aiman 300" />  Since it was not understood that these different presentations were all caused by the same set of [[mutations]] in the [[androgen receptor]] [[gene]], a unique name was given to each new combination of [[symptoms]], resulting in a complicated stratification of seemingly disparate disorders.<ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="2008 simpson" />

Over the last 60 years, as reports of strikingly different [[phenotypes]] were reported to occur even among members of the same family, and as steady progress was made towards the understanding of the underlying molecular [[pathogenesis]] of AIS, it has been demonstrated that these disorders are different phenotypic expressions of one syndrome caused by molecular defects in the androgen receptor gene.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /><ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="2008 simpson" />

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is now the accepted [[terminology]] for the syndromes resulting from unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic [[hormones]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  AIS is broken down into three classes based on phenotype: [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (CAIS), [[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (PAIS), and [[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (MAIS).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /><ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /><ref name="2005 kawate 90" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />  CAIS encompasses the phenotypes previously described by "testicular feminization," Morris' syndrome, and Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome;<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2004 hester 16" /> PAIS includes Reifenstein syndrome, Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome, Lub's syndrome, "incomplete testicular feminization," and Rosewater syndrome;<ref name="2008 simpson" /><ref name="1999 mcphaul 69" /><ref name="2000 miller" /> and MAIS includes Aiman's syndrome.<ref name="2002 sultan 20" />

The more [[Puberty#Physical changes in boys|virilized]] phenotypes of AIS have sometimes been described as "undervirilized male syndrome," "infertile male syndrome," "undervirilized fertile male syndrome," etc., before evidence was reported that these conditions were caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene.<ref name="1994 tsukada 79" />  These diagnoses were used to describe a variety of mild defects in virilization; as a result, the phenotypes of some men that have been diagnosed as such are better described by PAIS (e.g. [[micropenis]], [[hypospadias]] and [[cryptorchidism|undescended testes]]), while others are better described by MAIS (e.g. isolated [[male infertility|infertility]] or [[gynecomastia]]).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1994 tsukada 79" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" /><ref name="2000 miller" /><ref name="2002 chu 87" /><ref name="1997 mesched 3" />

===Popular culture===
The 1991 novel [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]] (later adopted into English "The Ring" series) describes that the central antagonist [[List of Ring characters#Gender|Sadako]] as having this syndrome.

In Season 2 Episode 13 "Skin Deep" of [[House (TV series)|House]], the main patient's [[testicular cancer]] is mistaken for an [[ovary]] due to the patient's undiscovered AIS.
