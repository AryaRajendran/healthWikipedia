[[Fluorescent lamp]]s have been suggested to have an impact on human health in various ways.

==Time==

Nocturnal exposure to light in the short wavelength ranges (below 530&nbsp;nm) generated by some [[fluorescent lamps]] may interfere with mammalian [[circadian rhythm]]s due to its suppressing effect on [[melatonin]] production.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kayumov| first1=L| last2=Lowe| first2=A| last3=Rahman| first3=SA| last4=Casper| first4=RF| last5=Shapiro| first5=CM| title=Prevention of melatonin suppression by nocturnal lighting: relevance to cancer. | journal=Eur J Cancer Prev. |author=Kayumov L, Lowe A, Rahman SA, Casper RF, Shapiro CM| volume=16| issue=4| pages=357–62 | year=2007 | pmid=17554209| doi=10.1097/01.cej.0000215622.59122.d4 }}</ref> Suppression of melatonin has been linked to cancer in some studies.

==Flicker effects==

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120&nbsp;Hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with [[light sensitivity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/soar/vision/light.html|title=Working with Light Sensitivity}}</ref> they are listed as problematic for some individuals with [[autism]], [[epilepsy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/epilepsy.html|title=Accommodation Ideas for Employees with Epilepsy}}</ref> [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/Lupus.html|title=Accommodation and Compliance Series: Employees with Lupus}}</ref> [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[Lyme disease]],<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10610642|title=Musculoskeletal and neurologic outcomes in patients with previously treated Lyme disease | volume=131 | issue=12|year=1999|month=December|journal=Ann.

The normally unnoticeable 100–120&nbsp;Hz flicker from fluorescent tubes powered by electromagnetic ballasts are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Individuals with high [[flicker fusion threshold]] are particularly affected by electromagnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=433–47 |year=1998 |title=The impact of flicker from fluorescent lighting on well-being, performance and physiological arousal |pmid=9557586 |author=Küller R, Laike T |doi=10.1080/001401398186928}}</ref> Ordinary people have better reading performance using high frequency (20&nbsp;kHz – 60&nbsp;kHz) electronic ballasts than electromagnetic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Light Res Tech |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=1995 |pages=243–256 |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc38944/nrcc38944.pdf/ |accessdate=2012-06-28 |author=Veitch JA, McColl SL |title=Modulation of fluorescent light: flicker rate and light source effects on visual performance and visual comfort |doi=10.1177/14771535950270040301}}</ref>

Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and [[Stereotypy|repetitive movement]] in [[autistic]] children.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Child Schizophr |year=1976 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=157–62 |title= The effects of fluorescent and incandescent illumination upon repetitive behaviors in autistic children |author= Colman RS, Frankel F, Ritvo E, Freeman BJ |doi=10.1007/BF01538059 |pmid=989489}}</ref> However, these studies had interpretive problems<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=1999 |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=839–49 |title= Annotation: Repetitive behaviour in autism: a review of psychological research |author= Turner M |pmid=10509879 |doi= 10.1017/S0021963099004278}}</ref> and have not been replicated.

[[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFL) are driven by electronic ballasts which operate in the range of 25–60&nbsp;kHz, which far exceeds the human ability to perceive flicker (25–70&nbsp;Hz).

==Blue/ultraviolet sensitivity==

The issue of blue or blue/ultraviolet sensitivity has been raised with respect to CFLs and other fluorescent lights at higher [[color temperature]]s (e.g., >4500°K).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightingresearch.net/programs/solidstate/pdf/whiteLEDVehicleForwardLighting.pdf|title=Van Derlofske, 'White LED sources for vehicle forward lighting', Soc. of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers, 2002}}</ref>  This effect can be compounded with sensitivity to pupillary flicker.

==Ultraviolet radiation risk==

Some fluorescent lamps emit [[ultraviolet radiation]] that in some circumstances can exceed safe levels. The [[Health Protection Agency]] of the [[United Kingdom]] has conducted research that concluded exposure to some [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) for 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30&nbsp;cm can exceed safe levels. Touching the exposed bulb results in equivalent exposure to ultraviolet radiation as that of being in direct sunlight.<ref name="hpa">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1223534061375|title=Emissions from compact fluorescent lights|accessdate=2009-08-31|publisher=Health Protection Agency|year=2008|format=PDF}}</ref> 

In 2009, [[Natural Resources Canada]] released a report <ref>http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/cfl-impact-study.cfm CFL Impact study, retrieved 2010 09 21</ref> describing the UV exposure due to lamps of several types. The report states that at 3&nbsp;cm distance, the recommended daily exposure to ultraviolet radiation for skin and eye damage was attained between 50 minutes and 5 hours depending on the type of lamp; the report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. The report states that most bare spiral lamps tested gave off more UV than the 60 watt incandescent lamp tested, but that the double-envelope CFLs emitted less UV. At 30&nbsp;cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 Watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. The report states that the [[threshold limit value]]s used represent otherwise healthy individuals who are not experiencing any hypersensitivity conditions or exposed to substances that increase UV sensitivity. [[Health effects of sun exposure|Outdoor sunlight]] can supply the maximum recommended daily UV exposure in 20 to 100 minutes.

==SCENIHR study and report ==

The [[Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks]] (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed<ref name="scenihr2008">{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_019.pdf|title=Light Sensitivity, Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks|accessdate=2009-08-31|publisher=Director-General for Health and Consumers, European Commission|year=2008|format=PDF|pages=26–27|quote=''Although the carcinogenic UV dose from fluorescent lighting in offices is minor (~ 1%) when compared to equal exposure times in the summer sun, old risk assessments showed that actual annual exposures of office workers could increase by 10 to 30% from the fluorescent lighting, which over a lifetime was estimated to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinomas by around 4% with a 
baseline risk much lower than that for outdoor workers who dominate incidences (Lytle et al 1992).''}}</ref> the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:
* Ultraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased [[probability]] of contracting [[squamous cell carcinoma]] by 4 percent.
* [[Melanoma]] has been shown to not be affected by CFLs through normal use.
* The constituent blue light of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur.
* The report states that "people with [[Autism]]/[[Asperger's syndrome]] have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed.
* The inner-ear condition [[Ménière's disease]] can be aggravated by flicker. Sufferers of [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] are recommended to not use fluorescent lights.
* [[Polymorphous light eruption]] is a condition affecting the skin thought to be caused by an adverse reaction to ultraviolet light. Its prevalence across Europe is 10-20% of the population  Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption.
* [[Chronic actinic dermatitis]] is a condition where a subject's skin becomes inflamed due to a reaction to sunlight or artificial light. Its prevalence in [[Scotland]] is 16.5 per 100,000 population. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition.
* The autoimmune disease [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] is exacerbated by CFLs.
* There is evidence that [[actinic prurigo]] is worsened by CFLs . This disease affects 3.3% of the general population.
* 3.1% of the population suffer [[solar urticaria]], a skin disorder affected by ultraviolet light. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs.
* [[Phytophotodermatitis]] may be aggravated by the additional levels of ultraviolet light emitted by CFLs.
* Patients undergoing [[photodynamic therapy]] are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs.
* Self-reporting suggests that 21% of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs.
* One cause of [[cataract]]s is exposure to ultraviolet light. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts.
* [[Photophobia]] is a symptom of excessive sensitivity to light which affects 5 to 20% of the population. No studies have been conducted into the effect of CFLs on sufferers of photophobia but there is the possibility for CFLs to affect sufferers.
* There is evidence that flicker can cause [[seizures]] in patients with [[photosensitive epilepsy]], but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps.
* Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate [[dyslexia]], but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. This opinion was updated by SCENIHR in 2012, with no significant changes from the opinion of 2008.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= SCENIHR |year=2012 |title= Health Effects of Artificial Light |author= Mattsson M-O et al. |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_035.pdf}}</ref>

==Mercury==
Fluorescent bulbs use [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. This is toxic if the bulb is broken. A broken bulb will mildly contaminate the local air (so the room should be ventilated) and the glass fragments are toxic.
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) provide [http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflcleanup.html safety guidelines for how to clear up a broken fluorescent bulb]. Mercury is particularly harmful to children and unborn babies, and so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a bulb is cleared up.

Bulbs which have reached the end of their life should not be disposed of in normal trash, as this will release the mercury. Several countries have specialised recycling or disposal systems for fluorescent bulbs, ''e.g''. [http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflrecycling.html US bulb recycling].

The U.S. EPA has stated that the amount of mercury in a compact fluorescent lightbulb (CFL) is
less than the extra mercury that would be released by the U.S. average mix of power plants to provide the energy used by an equivalent incandescent bulb.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/mercury/consumerinfo.htm#cfl</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2012}}<!-- Cite says many things on mercury content and mercury emissions but does not actually support this particular claim --->.

==Other conditions associated with fluorescent light==

In rare cases individuals with [[solar urticaria]] (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Dermatol |year=2003 |volume=139 |issue=9 |pages=1149–54 |title= Characteristics and prognosis of idiopathic solar urticaria: a cohort of 87 cases |author= Beattie PE, Dawe RS, Ibbotson SH, Ferguson J |pmid=12975156 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/139/9/1149 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.139.9.1149}}</ref> 
Very photosensitive individuals with [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] may experience disease activity under artificial light. Standard acrylic diffusers over the fluorescent lamps absorb nearly all the [[UV-B]] radiation and appear to protect against this.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Arthritis Rheum |year=1992 |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=949–52 |title= Fluorescent light photosensitivity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus |author= Rihner M, McGrath H Jr |doi=10.1002/art.1780350816 |pmid=1642660}}</ref> 

One paper suggested that in rare cases, [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]] can also induce [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]], subsequently, it can worsen [[depersonalization disorder]] symptomology.<ref name= "Simeon 03">{{cite journal | author = Simeon D, Knutelska M, Nelson D, Guralnik O | year = 2003 | title = Feeling unreal: a depersonalization disorder update of 117 cases | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = 9| pages = 990–7 | pmid = 14628973 | doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0903}}</ref> Research on these rare cases is very limited and cause and effect often cannot be duplicated.
