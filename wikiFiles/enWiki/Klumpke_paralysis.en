==Cause==
Klumpke's paralysis is a form of paralysis involving the muscles of the forearm and hand, resulting from a [[brachial plexus injury]] in which the eighth cervical ([[Cervical spinal nerve 8|C8]]) and first thoracic [[thoracic nerves|(T1)]] nerves are injured either before or after they have joined to form the lower trunk. The subsequent paralysis affects, principally, the intrinsic muscles of the hand (notably the [[interossei]], [[thenar muscles|thenar]] and [[hypothenar muscles]])<ref name=Merritt2009/> and the flexors of the wrist and fingers (notably [[flexor carpi ulnaris]] and ulnar half of the [[flexor digitorum profundus]]).<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" /><ref name=Shenaq&Spiegel/><ref name=Merritt2009>[http://books.google.com/books?id=si1Bm6bJhhQC&pg=PA512 Page 512: Lower Radicular Syndrome (Klumpke Paralysis)] in: {{cite book |author=Pedley, Timothy A.; Rowland, Lewis P.; Merritt, Hiram Houston |title=Merritt's neurology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9186-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>Klumpke palsy. Stedman's Dictionary. URL: [http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?exact=Y&keyword=Klumpke+palsy http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?exact=Y&keyword=Klumpke+palsy]. Accessed on: April 13, 2007.</ref> Forearm pronators and wrist flexors may be involved, as may dilators of the iris and elevators of the eyelid (both of which may be seen in the case of associated [[Horner's syndrome]]). The classic presentation of Klumpke's palsy is the “claw hand” where the forearm is supinated and the wrist and fingers are flexed. If Horner syndrome is present, there is miosis (constriction of the pupils) in the affected eye. 

The injury can result from difficulties in [[childbirth]]. The most common aetiological mechanism is caused by a traumatic vaginal delivery, necessitated by [[shoulder dystocia]]. The risk is greater when the mother is small or when the infant is of large weight.  Risk of injury to the lower brachial plexus results from traction on an abducted arm, as with an infant being pulled from the birth canal by an extended arm above the head or with someone catching himself by a branch as he falls from a tree.  Lower brachial plexus injuries should be distinguished from upper brachial plexus injuries, which can also result from birth trauma but give a different syndrome of weakness known as [[Erb's palsy]].

An easy way to remember Klumpke paralysis (or Klumpke's palsy) is by remembering the phrase "Klumpke the monkey hung from a tree", as a cause of injury is catching oneself on a tree branch when falling.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include [[Ulnar claw|claw hand]], [[paralysis]] of intrinsic [[hand muscles]], and [[ulnar nerve]] distribution numbness. Involvement of [[thoracic nerves|T1]] may result in [[Horner's syndrome]], with [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], and [[miosis]].<ref name="GraysAnatomy35th1046" /><ref name="pmid18236458">{{cite journal |author=Huang YG, Chen L, Gu YD, Yu GR |title=Histopathological basis of Horner's syndrome in obstetric brachial plexus palsy differs from that in adult brachial plexus injury |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=632–7 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18236458 |doi=10.1002/mus.20960}}</ref><ref name="MosbysDictionary3rded">{{cite book| title=Mosby's Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary | editors=Glanze, W.D., Anderson, K.N., & Anderson, L.E | edition=3rd | publisher= The C.V.

It can be contrasted to [[Erb's palsy|Erb-Duchenne's palsy]], which affects [[Cervical spinal nerve 5|C5]] and [[Cervical spinal nerve 6|C6]].

==Incidence/prevalence==
Klumpke Palsy is listed as a 'rare disease' by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This means that Klumpke palsy, or a subtype of Klumpke palsy, affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US population.
