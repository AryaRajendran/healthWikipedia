[[File:Nutrient-cycle hg.png|thumb|Nutrient cycle in the oceans]]
A '''nutrient''' is a [[chemical]] that an [[organism]] needs to live and grow or a substance used in an organism's metabolism which must be taken in from its environment.<ref name=WhitneyRolfes2005>[[Whitney, Elanor]] and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. ''Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition'', p 6. Thomson-Wadsworth.</ref> They are used to build and repair tissues, regulate body processes and are converted to and used as energy. Methods for nutrient intake vary, with animals and [[protist]]s consuming foods that are digested by an internal digestive system, but most [[plant]]s ingest nutrients directly from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s or from the [[atmosphere]].

[[Organic matter|Organic]] nutrients include [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[protein]]s (or their building blocks, [[amino acid]]s), and [[vitamin]]s. Inorganic chemical compounds such as [[dietary mineral]]s, [[water]], and [[oxygen]] may also be considered nutrients.<ref name="SIZERWHITNEY2007">{{cite book|author1=FRANCES SIZER|author2=ELLIE WHITNEY|title=NUTRITION: CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mDhMU0Sv6asC&pg=PT26|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 November 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-39065-7|pages=26–}}</ref> A nutrient is said to be "[[Essential nutrient|essential]]" if it must be obtained from an external source, either because the organism cannot synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities. Nutrients needed in very small amounts are [[micronutrient]]s and those that are needed in larger quantities are called macronutrients. The effects of nutrients are [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose-dependent]] and shortages are called deficiencies.<ref name="Ensminger1994">{{cite book|author=Audrey H.

* The [[chemical element]]s humans consume in the largest quantities are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]], or [[CHNOPS]].
* The classes of [[chemical compound]]s humans consume in the largest quantities and which provide bulk energy are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and fats. [[Water]] and atmospheric [[oxygen]] also must be consumed in large quantities, but are not always considered "food" or "nutrients".
* [[Calcium]], [[salt]] ([[sodium]] and [[chloride]]), [[magnesium]], and [[potassium]] (along with phosphorus and sulfur) are sometimes added to the [[list of macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to other vitamins and minerals. They are sometimes referred to as the [[Dietary mineral|macrominerals]].

===Substances that provide energy===
* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]s. Carbohydrates are classified by their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).
* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of the [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. The body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s); the diet must supply these. [[Protein]]s, in [[nutrition]], are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] through [[digestion]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.
* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acids are unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains, connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed to keep [[cell membrane]]s functioning properly, to insulate body organs against shock, to keep body temperature stable, and to maintain healthy skin and hair. The body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s) and the diet must supply these.

Fat has an [[energy]] content of 9 kcal/g (~37.7 kJ/g); [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s 4 kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g). [[Ethanol]] ([[grain alcohol]]) has an energy content of 7 kcal/g (~29.3 kJ/g).<ref>Coyle EF. 1995. Fat metabolism during exercise. Sports science exchange 8(6):59-65</ref>

===Substances that support metabolism===
* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
* [[Vitamin]]s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [[coenzyme]]s or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for various proteins in the body.
* [[Water]] is an essential nutrient and is the [[solvent]] in which all the chemical reactions of life take place.

Other chemical elements are also necessary to carry out various life processes and build structures; see [[fertilizer]] and [[micronutrient]] for more information.

==Essential and non-essential nutrients==
{{main|Essential nutrient}}
Nutrients are frequently categorized as essential or nonessential. [[Essential nutrient]]s are unable to be synthesized internally (either at all, or in sufficient quantities), and so must be consumed by an organism from its environment.<ref name="VaughanGeissler2009">{{cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson|coauthors=Elisabeth Dowle, Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–}}</ref> Nonessential nutrients are those nutrients that can be made by the body, they may often also be absorbed from consumed food.<ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"/> The majority of animals ultimately derive their essential nutrients from plants,<ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"/> though some animals may consume mineral-based soils to supplement their diet.

For humans, these include [[essential fatty acid]]s, [[essential amino acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and certain [[dietary mineral]]s. [[Oxygen]] and [[water]] are also essential for human survival, but are generally not considered "food" when consumed in isolation.

Humans can derive energy from a wide variety of [[fat]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[ethanol]], and can synthesize other needed amino acids from the essential nutrients.

Non-essential substances within foods can still have a significant impact on health, whether beneficial or toxic. For example, most [[dietary fiber]] is not absorbed by the human digestive tract, but is important in digestion and absorption of otherwise harmful substances. Interest has recently increased in [[phytochemical]]s, which include many non-essential substances which may have health benefits.<ref name=WhitneyRolfes2005/>

==Deficiencies and toxicity==
An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including inadequacy in nutrient intake called dietary deficiency, or conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.<ref name="Ensminger1994">{{cite book|author=Audrey H. Ensminger|title=Foods & nutrition encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C&pg=PA527|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8980-1|pages=527–}}</ref>  Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.<ref name="Ensminger1994"/>

Nutrient toxicity occurs when an excess of a nutrient does harm to an organism.

In plants five types of deficiency or toxicity symptoms are common:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/BotanicalSciences/PlantHormones/EssentialPlant/EssentialPlant.htm |title=Essential Plant Nutrients |publisher=Cartage.org.lb |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}</ref>
* [[Chlorosis]] -  which is the yellowing of plant tissue caused by a shortage of chlorophyll synthesis.
* [[Necrosis]] -  which is the death of tissue.
* Accumulation of [[anthocyanin]]  - which produces a purple or reddish colorization of foliage and/or stems.
* Lack of new growth.
* Stunting or reduced growth -  where new growth is stunted or reduced.

Oversupply of plant nutrients in the environment can cause excessive plant and [[algae]] growth. [[Eutrophication]], as this process is called, may cause imbalances in population numbers and other nutrients that can be harmful to certain species. For example, an [[algal bloom]] can deplete the [[oxygen]] available for fish to breathe. Causes include [[water pollution]] from [[sewage]] or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from farms (carrying excess agricultural fertilizer). Nitrogen and phosphorus are most commonly the [[limiting factor]] in growth, and thus the most likely to trigger eutrophication when introduced artificially.
