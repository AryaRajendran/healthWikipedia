Coup and contrecoup injuries are considered [[Focal and diffuse brain injury|focal brain injuries]], those that occur in a particular spot in the brain, as opposed to diffuse injuries, which occur over a more widespread area.<ref name="Hardman02"/> 

The exact mechanism for the injuries, especially contrecoup injuries, is a subject of much debate.<ref name="Shaw02">

The presenter of the chosen paper was not awarded the prize because he failed to make recommended changes. In 1768, the group met again on the topic, and [[Louis Sebastian Saucerotte]] won the prize for his paper describing contrecoup injuries in humans and [[animal experimentation|experiments on animals]] and recommending treatments such as [[bloodletting]] and application of [[herb]]s to patients' heads.<ref name="FingerS">{{cite book |author=Finger S|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations into Brain Function |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2001 |pages=429–430 |isbn=0-19-514694-8 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_GMeW9E1IB4C&pg=PA429&lpg=PA429&dq=antoine+louis+contrecoup}}</ref>

Contrecoup is the subject of a [[They Might Be Giants]] song off their album [[The Else]].  It was written as a challenge to create a song using the words contrecoup, craniosophic, and limerent. <ref>{{cite web|title=This Might Be a Wiki|url=http://tmbw.net/wiki/Contrecoup}}</ref>
