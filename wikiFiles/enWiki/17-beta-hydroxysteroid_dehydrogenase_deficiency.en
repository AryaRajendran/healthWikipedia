'''17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency''' is a rare [[disorder of sexual development]] affecting [[testosterone]] biosynthesis by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III]] (17β-HSD III), which can produce impaired [[virilization]] (traditionally termed [[male pseudohermaphroditism]]) of genetically male infants and children and excessive virilization of female adults. 

It is an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8550739 |year=1996 |month=January |author=Andersson, S; Geissler, Wm; Wu, L; Davis, Dl; Grumbach, Mm; New, Mi; Schwarz, Hp; Blethen, Sl; Mendonca, Bb; Bloise, W; Witchel, Sf; Cutler, Gb, Jr; Griffin, Je; Wilson, Jd; Russel, Dw |title=Molecular genetics and pathophysiology of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=130–6 |issn=0021-972X |journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |doi=10.1210/jc.81.1.130}}</ref> condition and is one of the few disorders of sexual development that can affect the [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and/or [[secondary sex characteristic]]s of both [[XY sex-determination system|males and females]].

==Prevalence==
In the [[Netherlands]], 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency is estimated to occur in 1:147,000 newborns.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10599740 |doi=10.1210/jc.84.12.4713 |title=17 -Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase-3 Deficiency: Diagnosis, Phenotypic Variability, Population Genetics, and Worldwide Distribution of Ancient and de Novo Mutations |year=1999 |author=Boehmer, A. L. M. |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=84 |pages=4713–21 |issue=12}}</ref>

==Clinical characteristics==
17-β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency is clinically characterized by either ambiguous external genitalia or complete female external genitalia at birth; as a consequence of impaired male sexual differentiation in 46,XY individuals. Further investigations on ambiguous genitalia will eventually lead to findings of [[intersexuality]]. Severely impaired [[virilization]] (often complete absence of male sexual differentiation) can lead to development of female external genitalia. These children are raised as female, and their diagnosis is often discovered when there is absence of menarche (first menstruation) and when they begin to virilize during puberty (slowly become more like a man; deepening of the voice, acne, male musculature etc.). At careful examination, testis can often be found in the inguinal channel.

==Biochemistry==
[[Image:Test biosynth 17BHSD3.jpg|thumb|center|400px| Biochemical effects of 17β-hydroxysteroid deficiency-3 in testosterone biosynthesis. Typically levels of androstenedione are significantly increased, whilst testosterone levels are decreased, leading to male [[undervirilization]].]]

17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency is characterized biochemically by decreased levels of testosterone and increased levels of androstenedione as a result of the defect in conversion of androstenedione into testosterone. This leads to clinically important higher ratio of androstenedione to testosterone (A'dion/T) (see figure).

==Genetics==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]] 

17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase III deficiency is caused by [[mutation]]s found in the 17β-HSD III ([[17BHSD3]]) gene.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11158067 |year=2001 |month=February |author=Lindqvist, A; Hughes, Ia; Andersson, S |title=Substitution mutation C268Y causes 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=921–3 |issn=0021-972X |journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11158067 |format=Free full text |doi=10.1210/jc.86.2.921}}</ref> 17β-HSD III deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder.
