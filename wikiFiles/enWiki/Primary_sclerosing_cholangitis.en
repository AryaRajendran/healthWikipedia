'''Primary sclerosing cholangitis''' ('''PSC''') is a disease of the bile ducts that causes inflammation and subsequent obstruction of bile ducts both at a intrahepatic (inside the liver) and extrahepatic (outside the liver) level. The inflammation impedes the flow of [[bile]] to the gut, which can ultimately lead to [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[liver failure]] and [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]]. The underlying cause of the inflammation is believed to be [[autoimmunity]];<ref name=Charatchar>{{cite journal

==Signs and symptoms==
PSC is characterized by recurrent episodes of cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts), with progressive biliary scarring and obstruction. 
* Chronic fatigue (a [[non-specific symptom]] often present in liver disease)
* Severe [[jaundice]] with intense [[itch]]ing
* [[Malabsorption]] (especially of [[fat]]) and [[steatorrhea]] (fatty stool) due to biliary obstruction, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s, [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]] and [[vitamin K|K]].
* Signs of [[cirrhosis]]
* [[Hepatomegaly]] (enlarged liver)
* [[Portal hypertension]]
* [[Ascending cholangitis]], or [[infection]] of the bile duct.
* Dark urine due to excess [[conjugated bilirubin]], which is water soluble, being excreted by the kidneys
* [[Hepatic encephalopathy]] (confusion caused by liver dysfunction)

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is by [[Medical imaging|imaging]] of the bile duct, usually in the setting of [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP, [[endoscopy]] of the bile duct and [[pancreas]]), which shows "beading" (both strictures and dilation) of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Another option is [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP), where [[magnetic resonance imaging]] is used to visualise the [[biliary tract]].

Most patients with PSC have evidence of [[autoantibodies]]. Approximately 80% of patients have perinuclear [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody#p-ANCA|anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]], also called '''[[P-ANCA]]'''; however, this finding is not specific for PSC.  [[Antinuclear antibodies]] and [[anti-smooth muscle antibody]] are found in 20%-50% of PSC patients and, likewise, are not specific for the disease.<ref name=Charatchar/> 

Other tests often done are a [[full blood count]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[bilirubin]] levels (usually grossly elevated), [[renal function]], [[electrolyte]]s. [[Fecal fat]] determination is occasionally ordered when the symptoms of malabsorption are prominent.

The differential diagnosis can include [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], drug induced [[cholestasis]], [[cholangiocarcinoma]], and [[HIV]]-associated cholangiopathy.

==Etiology==
The cause of PSC is unknown, although it is thought to be an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disorder]].  There is an increased prevalence of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] alleles A1, B8, and DR3 in primary sclerosing cholangitis.<ref name=Charatchar/>

==Pathophysiology==
Inflammation damages bile ducts both inside and outside of the liver.  The resulting scarring of the bile ducts blocks the flow of bile, causing [[cholestasis]]. Bile stasis and back-pressure induces proliferation of epithelial cells and focal destruction of the liver parenchyma, forming bile lakes.  Chronic biliary obstruction causes portal tract fibrosis and ultimately [[biliary cirrhosis]] and liver  failure.<ref name=Robbins>

Bile assists in the enteric breakdown and absorption of fat; the absence of bile leads to fat malabsorption and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).

==Epidemiology==
There is a 2:1 male-to-female predilection of primary sclerosing cholangitis.<ref name=Robbins/> The disease normally starts from age 20 to 30, though may begin in childhood. PSC progresses slowly, so the [[disease]] can be active for a long time before it is noticed or diagnosed. There is relatively little data on the prevalence and incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, with studies in different countries showing annual incidence of 0.068–1.3 per 100,000 people and prevalence 0.22–8.5 per 100,000; given that PSC is closely linked with ulcerative colitis, it is likely that the risk is higher in populations where UC is more common.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feld JJ, Heathcote EJ |title=Epidemiology of autoimmune liver disease |journal=J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1118–28 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=12974897 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1746.2003.03165.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1440-1746.2003.03165.x/full}}</ref>

==Related diseases==
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with [[cholangiocarcinoma]], a cancer of the biliary tree, and the lifetime risk for PSC sufferers is 10-15%.  Screening for cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis is encouraged, but there is no general consensus on the modality and interval of choice.

[[Colon cancer]] is also associated with PSC.

PSC has a significant association with [[ulcerative colitis]], an [[inflammatory bowel disease]] primarily affecting the large intestine. As many as 5% of patients with ulcerative colitis may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis <ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsson R, Danielsson A, Järnerot G, ''et al.'' |title=Prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with ulcerative colitis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=100 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1319–23 |year=1991 |pmid=2013375 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and approximately 70% of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have ulcerative colitis.<ref name=Robbins/>

==Therapy==
Standard treatment includes [[ursodiol]], a bile acid naturally produced by the liver, which has been shown to lower elevated liver enzyme numbers in people with PSC, but has not improved liver- or overall survival.<ref name=Lindor>{{cite journal

In some cases, ERCP, which may involve stenting of the common bile duct, may be necessary in order to open major blockages (dominant strictures).

[[Liver transplantation]] is the only proven long-term treatment of PSC. Indications for transplantation include recurrent bacterial cholangitis, jaundice refractory to medical and endoscopic treatment, decompensated cirrhosis and complications of [[portal hypertension]]. In one series, 1, 2, and 5 year survival following liver transplantation for PSC was 90%, 86% and 85% respectively.<ref name=Charatchar/>

==Prognosis==
A German study in 2007 estimated the average [[survival time]] from time of diagnosis to be approximately 25 years, and the median time until either death or liver transplantation to be approximately 10 years.<ref>{{cite pmid|17037993}} [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/552669_3].
