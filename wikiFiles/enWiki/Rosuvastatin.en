'''Rosuvastatin''' (marketed by [[AstraZeneca]] as '''Crestor''') is a member of the [[medication|drug]] class of [[statin]]s, used in combination with exercise, diet, and weight-loss to treat [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] and related conditions, and to prevent [[cardiovascular disease]]. It was developed by [[Shionogi]].

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of rosuvastatin is for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]].<ref name=AHFS/> It is recommended to be used only after other measures such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction have not improved cholesterol levels.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Crestor|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/crestor.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

==Side effects and contraindications==
Side effects are uncommon. The following side effects should be reported to the prescribing doctor if they persist or get worse:<ref name=MedLine>{{cite web|title=Rosuvastatin|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a603033.html|work=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=15 June 2012}}</ref>

Rosuvastatin has multiple [[contraindication]]s, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with rosuvastatin, including hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any component of the formulation, active liver disease, elevation of serum [[transaminase]]s, pregnancy, or breast-feeding.<ref name=AZPI>{{cite web | title=Package Insert | year=2012 | url=http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/crestor.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=AstraZeneca PLC | accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref> Rosuvastatin must not be taken while pregnant as it can cause serious harm to the unborn baby.<ref name=RxList/> In the case of breastfeeding, it is unknown whether rosuvastatin is passed through breastmilk, but due to the potential of disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism, patients should not breast feed while on rosuvastatin.<ref name=LactMed>{{cite web|title=Rosuvastatin|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~jLYVIr:1|work=LactMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=RxList/>

==Drug interactions== 
The following drugs can have negative interactions with rosuvastatin and should be discussed with the prescribing doctor:<ref name=MedLine/>

*[[Anticoagulant]]s ('blood thinners') can affect the removal of rosuvastatin, examples include: [[warfarin]] (Coumadin); [[cimetidine]] (Tagamet); [[cyclosporine]] (Neoral, Sandimmune); ketoconazole (Nizoral)
*Additional medications for high cholesterol such as [[clofibrate]] (Atromid-S), [[fenofibrate]] (Tricor), [[gemfibrozil]] (Lopid), and [[niacin]] (Niaspan, Niacor);
*Specific [[HIV protease inhibitor]]s including [[atazanavir]] (Reyataz), taken with [[ritonavir]] (Norvir) and [[lopinavir]] and [[ritonavir]] (Kaletra); and [[spironolactone]] (Aldactone). 
*Alcohol intake should be reduced while on rosuvastatin in order to decrease risk of developing liver damage.<ref name=RxList/>
*Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide antacids such as [[Mylanta]] and  [[Maalox]], should be taken at least two hours after taking rosuvastatin<ref name=RxList/>

==Structure==
Rosuvastatin has structural similarities with most other synthetic [[statin]]s, e.g., [[atorvastatin]], [[cerivastatin]] and [[pitavastatin]], but unlike other statins rosuvastatin contains [[sulfur]].

Crestor is actually rosuvastatin calcium,<ref name="FDAlabel"/> in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in the [[carboxylic acid]] group on the right of the two structure diagrams.

==Mechanism of action==
{{further2|[[Statin]]}}

Rosuvastatin is a [[competitive inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]], having a mechanism of action similar to that of other statins.<!--

As of 2004, rosuvastatin had been approved in 154 countries and launched in 56.  Approval in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] came on August 12, 2003.<ref name="FDAapproval">{{cite news | title=FDA Approves New Drug for Lowering Cholesterol | url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01247.html | date=August 12, 2003 | publisher=The Food and Drug Administration | accessdate=2005-03-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050207153150/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01247.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2005-02-07}}</ref> 

The results of the [[JUPITER trial]] (2008) suggested rosuvastatin may decrease the [[relative risk]] of [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] in patients without [[hyperlipidemia]], but with elevated levels of [[HsCRP|highly sensitive C-reactive protein]]. This could strongly impact medical practice by  placing many patients on statin [[prophylaxis]] who otherwise would have been untreated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ridker PM, Danielson E, et al. |title=Rosuvastatin to Prevent Vascular Events in Men and Women with Elevated C-Reactive Protein |journal=N.

The [[AURORA trial]] randomized 2776 patients undergoing hemodialysis due to kidney damage to receive either rosuvastatin or placebo.  The randomized, double-blind study (2005 to 2009) found no difference in the two groups in the primary end-point, a combination of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.  The study found no difference in all-cause mortality among this population at a mean follow-up of 3.8 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fellstrom BC, Jardine AG, et al. |title=Rosuvastatin and Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis |journal=N.

===Effects on cholesterol levels===
The effects of rosuvastatin on LDL cholesterol are dose-related.  At the 10&nbsp;mg dose, the average LDL cholesterol reduction was found to be 46% in one trial.  Increasing the dose from 10&nbsp;mg to 40&nbsp;mg gave a modest additional 9% absolute reduction in LDL levels (55% below baseline levels).<ref name="Jones-2003">{{cite journal | author=Jones PH, Davidson MH, Stein EA, Bays HE, McKenney JM, Miller E, Cain VA, Blasetto JW. | title=Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR Trial) | journal=Am J Cardiol | year=2003 | volume=92 | issue=2 | pages=152–60 | pmid=12860216 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00530-7}}</ref>

===FDA advisory for East Asian patients===
According to the FDA, the risk of myopathy during rosuvastatin therapy may be increased in Asian Americans:
<blockquote>Because Asians appear to process the drug differently, half the standard dose can have the same cholesterol-lowering benefit in those patients, though a full dose could increase the risk of side-effects, a study by the drug's manufacturer, AstraZeneca, indicated.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/03/nation/na-crestor3 FDA Advisory Targets Asian Patients (Los Angeles Times)].</ref></blockquote>

Therefore, physicians should start Asian-American or East Asian patients at the lowest dose level.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/news/20050303/fda-updates-crestor-warning-information Asian-Americans Among Groups More at Risk of Serious Muscle Damage (WebMD)].</ref>

==Marketing and competition==

===Patent protection===
The main patent protecting rosuvastatin (RE37,314 - due to expire in 2016) was challenged as being an improper reissue of an earlier patent. This challenge was rejected in 2010, confirming protection until 2016.

===Marketing===
The drug was billed as a "super-statin" during its clinical development; the claim was that it offers high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to rosuvastatin are [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor) and [[simvastatin]] (Zocor). However, people can also combine [[ezetimibe]] with either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. So far, some published information for comparing rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results is available, but many of the relevant studies are still in progress.<!--
  --><ref name="ASTEROID"/>

First launched in 2003, sales of rosuvastatin were $129 million and $908 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively, with a total patient treatment population of over 4 million by the end of 2004.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
Typical per patient costs to the UK NHS are £18.03-26.02/month (compared to £0.85-1.37/month for [[simvastatin]]).

Generic rosuvastatin is also produced by pharmaceutical companies in India and elsewhere, and often sold under its [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] Rosuvastatin.  It is marketed by [[Cipla|Cipla Pharmaceuticals]] under the [[trade name]] Rosulip, and macleods marketed by Rozustat,Rolip from Orchid chemicals & pharmaceauticals.

===Debate and criticisms===
In October 2003, several months after its introduction in [[Europe]], [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]], the editor of the [[medical journal]] ''[[The Lancet]]'', criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," according to his editorial. ''The Lancet's'' editorial position is that the data for Crestor’s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in ''The Lancet'', AstraZeneca's CEO [[Tom McKillop|Sir Tom McKillop]] called the editorial "flawed and incorrect" and slammed the journal for making "such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine."<!--

In 2004, the consumer interest organization [[Public Citizen]] filed a [[Citizen's Petition]] with the FDA, asking that Crestor be withdrawn from the US market. On March 11, 2005, the FDA issued a letter to Sidney M. Wolfe, M.D. of Public Citizen both denying the petition and providing an extensive detailed analysis of findings that demonstrated no basis for concerns about rosuvastatin compared with the other statins approved for marketing in the United States.<ref name="FDA ruling">{{cite web | author =Food and Drug Administration | title = Docket No. 2004P-0113/CP1 |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04p0113/04p-0113-pdn0001.pdf|format=PDF }}</ref>

===Myopathy===
As with all statins, there is a concern of [[rhabdomyolysis]], a severe undesired side effect.  The FDA has indicated that "it does not appear that the risk [of rhabdomyolysis] is greater with Crestor than with other marketed statins", but has mandated that a warning about this side-effect, as well as a kidney toxicity warning, be added to the product label.<!--
