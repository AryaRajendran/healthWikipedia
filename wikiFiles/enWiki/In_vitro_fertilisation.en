[[File:Oocyte.jpg|thumb|A "naked" egg]]

'''''In vitro'' fertilisation''' ('''IVF''') is a process by which [[ovum|an egg]] is [[Fertilisation|fertilised]] by [[spermatocyte|sperm]] outside the body: ''[[in vitro]]''. IVF is a major treatment for [[infertility]] when other methods of [[assisted reproductive technology]] have failed. The process involves monitoring a woman's ovulatory process, removing [[ovum|ovum or ova]] (egg or eggs) from the woman's [[ovary|ovaries]] and letting [[spermatozoon|sperm]] fertilise them in a fluid medium in a laboratory. When a woman's natural cycle is monitored to collect a naturally selected ovum (egg) for fertilisation, it is known as natural cycle IVF. The fertilised egg ([[zygote]]) is then transferred to the patient's [[uterus]] with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy. The first successful birth of a "test tube baby", [[Louise Brown]], occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF. [[Robert G. Edwards]], the physiologist who developed the treatment, was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2010.

The term ''[[in vitro]]'', from the [[Latin]] meaning ''in glass'', is used, because early biological experiments involving cultivation of tissues outside the living organism from which they came, were carried out in glass containers such as ''[[beaker (glassware)|beakers]], [[test tube]]s, or [[petri dish]]es.'' Today, the term ''in vitro'' is used to refer to any biological procedure that is performed outside the organism it would normally be occurring in, to distinguish it from an ''[[in vivo]]'' procedure, where the tissue remains inside the living organism within which it is normally found. A colloquial term for babies conceived as the result of IVF, "test tube babies", refers to the tube-shaped containers of glass or plastic resin, called ''test tubes,'' that are commonly used in chemistry labs and biology labs. However, ''in vitro'' fertilisation is usually performed in the shallower containers called [[Petri dish]]es. One IVF method, [[Autologous Endometrial Coculture]], is actually performed on organic material, but is still considered ''in vitro''.

Therefore, do not change "fertilisation" to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->
IVF may be used to overcome [[female infertility]] in the woman due to problems of the [[fallopian tube]], making fertilisation ''in vivo'' difficult. It may also assist in [[male infertility]], where there is a defect in [[sperm quality]], and in such cases [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) may be used, where a sperm cell is injected directly into the egg cell. This is used when sperm have difficulty penetrating the egg, and in these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. When indicated, the use of ICSI has been found to increase the success rates of IVF.

According to [[NICE guidelines]], IVF is indicated in [[unexplained infertility]] for women that have not conceived after 2 years of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.<ref>[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems]. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] CG156 - Issued: February 2013</ref>

For IVF to be successful it typically requires healthy [[ovum|ova]], sperm that can fertilise, and a [[uterus]] that can maintain a pregnancy. Due to the costs of the procedure, IVF is generally attempted only after less expensive options have failed.

IVF is also indicated in cases where any of its expansions is of interest, that is, a procedure that is usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF. Such expansions include [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) to rule out presence of [[genetic disorder]]s, as well as [[egg donation]] or [[surrogacy]] where the woman providing the egg isn't the same who will carry the pregnancy to term. Further details in the [[#Expansions|Expansions]]-section below.

==Method==
<!-- This article was started with British spelling, and therefore should remain at British spelling according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English. Therefore, do not change "fertilisation to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->
Theoretically, fertilisation could be performed by collecting the contents from a woman's fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, mixing it with [[semen]], and reinserting into the uterus. However, without additional techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. Such additional techniques that are routinely used in IVF include [[ovarian hyperstimulation]] to retrieve multiple eggs, ultrasound-guided [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]] directly from the ovaries, egg and sperm preparation, as well as culture and selection of resultant embryos before [[embryo transfer]] back into the uterus.

===Ovarian hyperstimulation===
{{Main|Ovarian hyperstimulation}}There are two current main protocols for stimulating the ovaries for IVF treatment. The long protocol involves downregulation (suppression or exhaustion) of the pituitary ovarian axis by the prolonged use of a GnRH agonist. Subsequent ovarian hyperstimulation, typically using follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), starts once the process of downregulation is complete, generally after 10 to 14 days. An IVF cycle using this protocol is known as conventional IVF.

The short protocol skips the downregulation part, and consists of a regimen of [[fertility]] medications to stimulate the development of multiple [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovaries. In most patients, injectable [[gonadotropin]]s (usually [[Follicle stimulating hormone|FSH]] analogues) are used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the [[estradiol]] level and, by means of [[gynecologic ultrasonography]], follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary. Spontaneous ovulation during the cycle is typically prevented by the use of [[GnRH antagonists]] that are used just during the last days of stimulation to block the natural surge of [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) and allow the physician to start the ovulation process by using medication, usually injectable [[human chorionic gonadotropin]]s.

Ovarian stimulation carries the risk of excessive stimulation leading to [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS). This complication is life-threatening and ovarian stimulation using gonadotropins must only be carried out under strict medical supervision.

===Natural and mild IVF===
IVF can be performed by collecting a naturally selected egg from woman’s natural menstrual cycle without the use of any [[fertility medication|drugs]]. It is known as natural cycle IVF.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855409 The ISMAAR proposal on terminology for ovarian stimulation for IVF]. By Nargund G, Fauser BC, Macklon NS, Ombelet W, Nygren K, Frydman R; Rotterdam ISMAAR Consensus Group on Terminology for Ovarian Stimulation for IVF.</ref> The first test tube baby [[Louise Brown]] was born following natural cycle IVF. This method can be successfully used when women want to avoid taking ovarian stimulating drugs with its associated side-effects. [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority|HFEA]] has estimated the [[live birth rate]] to be approximately 1.3% per natural cycle IVF for women aged between 40–42.<ref>[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/natural-cycle-ivf.html Natural cycle IVF] at the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] homepage.</ref>

The next step-up method is called modified natural cycle IVF. In this method, medication is used for 2–4 days during woman’s natural cycle to avoid spontaneous ovulation and to make the treatment more successful. As the success rates are improved it is a widely used method of natural IVF.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} It is particularly beneficial in women with very low egg reserve and in those whose ovaries do not respond to [[fertility medication|drugs]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Mild IVF<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19586428 Natural/mild assisted reproductive technologies: reducing cost and increasing safety]. By Nargund G</ref> is a method where a small dose of ovarian stimulating drugs are used for a short duration during a woman’s natural cycle aimed at producing 2–7 eggs and creating healthy embryos. This method appears to be an advance in the field to reduce complications and side-effects for women and it is aimed at quality, and not quantity of eggs and embryos. One study comparing a mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with [[GnRH antagonist]] co-treatment combined with [[single embryo transfer]]) to a standard treatment (stimulation with a [[GnRH agonist]] long-protocol and transfer of two embryos) came to the result that the proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term [[Live birth (human)|live birth]] after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60360-2}}</ref> Mild IVF can be cheaper than conventional IVF and with a significantly reduced risk of [[multiple birth|multiple gestation]] and [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome|OHSS]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858698 Mild ovarian stimulation for IVF: 10 years later] . By Fauser BC, Nargund G, Andersen AN, Norman R, Tarlatzis B, Boivin J, Ledger W.</ref> There is also evidence that the birthweights of babies are higher in women treated by natural or mild IVF compared to conventional IVF.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Final maturation and egg retrieval===
{{Further|Final maturation (IVF)|Transvaginal oocyte retrieval}}
When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, [[Ovulation_induction#final maturation|induction of final oocyte maturation]] is performed, generally by an injection of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the "trigger shot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infertility.about.com/od/infertilitytreatments/ss/ivf_treatment_5.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Infertility.about.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> hCG acts as an analogue of [[luteinising hormone]], and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection,<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515 HCG Injection After Ovulation Induction With Clomiphene Citrate] at Medscape. By Peter Kovacs. Posted: 23 April 2004</ref> but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]]. Using a [[GnRH agonist]] instead of hCG eliminates the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a delivery rate of approximately 6% less than with hCG.<ref name=Humaidan2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr008 }}</ref>

The eggs are retrieved from the patient using a transvaginal technique called [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]], involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle follicles can be aspirated, and the follicular fluid is passed to an embryologist to identify ova. It is common to remove between ten and thirty eggs. The retrieval procedure takes usually takes between 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the number of mature follicles, and is usually done under [[conscious sedation]] or [[general anaesthesia]].

===Egg and sperm preparation===
In the laboratory, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells and prepared for [[fertilisation]]. An [[oocyte selection]] may be performed prior to fertilisation to select eggs with optimal chances of successful pregnancy. In the meantime, [[semen]] is prepared for fertilisation by removing inactive cells and seminal fluid in a process called [[sperm washing]]. If semen is being provided by a [[sperm donor]], it will usually have been prepared for treatment before being frozen and quarantined, and it will be thawed ready for use.

===Fertilisation===
The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in the [[culture media]] for about 18 hours. In most cases, the egg will be fertilised by that time and the fertilised egg will show two [[pronuclei]]. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells.

In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]], eggs are removed from the woman and placed in one of the fallopian tubes, along with the man's sperm. This allows fertilisation to take place inside the woman's body. Therefore, this variation is actually an ''[[in vivo]]'' fertilisation, not an ''[[in vitro]]'' fertilisation.

===Embryo culture===
{{Main|Embryo culture}}
Typically, embryos are cultured until having reached the 6 to 8 cell stage three days after retrieval. In many Canadian, American and Australian programmes{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, however, embryos are placed into an extended culture system with a transfer done at the [[blastocyst]] stage at around five days after retrieval, especially if many good-quality embryos are still available on day 3. Blastocyst stage transfers have been shown to result in higher pregnancy rates.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Papanikolaou EG, Camus M, Kolibianakis EM, Van Landuyt L, Van Steirteghem A, Devroey P| title=In Vitro Fertilization with Single Blastocyst-Stage versus Single Cleavage-Stage Embryos | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2006 | pages=1139–46 | volume=354 | pmid=16540614 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053524 | issue=11}}</ref> In Europe, transfers after 2 days are common.

===Embryo selection===
{{Further|Embryo quality}}
Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge oocyte and [[embryo]] quality. In order to optimise [[pregnancy rate]]s, there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos.<ref name=Rebmann>{{Cite journal|author=Rebmann V, Switala M, Eue I, Grosse-Wilde H |title=Soluble HLA-G is an independent factor for the prediction of pregnancy outcome after ART: a German multi-centre study |journal=Hum Reprod |volume= 25|issue= 7|pages= 1691–8|year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20488801 |doi=10.1093/humrep/deq120 |url=}}</ref>

===Embryo transfer===
{{Main|Embryo transfer}}
Embryos are failed by the embryologist based on the amount of cells, evenness of growth and degree of fragmentation. The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the woman and other health and diagnostic factors. In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are transferred except in unusual circumstances. In the UK and according to [[HFEA]] regulations, a woman over 40 may have up to three embryos transferred, whereas in the USA, younger women may have many embryos transferred based on individual fertility diagnosis. Most clinics and country regulatory bodies seek to minimise the risk of pregnancies carrying multiples, as it is not uncommon for more implantations to take than desired. The embryos judged to be the "best" are transferred to the patient's uterus through a thin, plastic [[catheter]], which goes through her [[vagina]] and cervix. Several embryos may be passed into the uterus to improve chances of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and pregnancy.

==Success rates==

IVF success rates are the percentage of all IVF procedures which result in a favorable outcome. Depending on the type of calculation used, this outcome may represent the number of confirmed pregnancies, called the [[pregnancy rate]] or number of live births, called the [[live birth rate]].

Due to advancement in reproductive technology, the IVF success rates are substantially better today than they were just a few years ago. The most current data available in the United States a 2009 summary complied by the Society for Reproductive Medicine which reports the average national IVF success rates per age group using non-donor eggs (see table below).<ref name="2009 Clinic Summary Report">{{cite web|title=2009 Clinic Summary Report|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|work=Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%.<ref name=canadians>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081215.wivf1215/BNStory/National/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081215.wivf1215 Success rate climbs for in vitro fertilization] The Canadian Press. 15 December 2008 at 8:27&nbsp;pm EST</ref> A French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the center and 26% after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF discontinuation was mainly due to [[adoption]] (46%) or [[spontaneous pregnancy]] (42%).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=de La Rochebrochard E, Quelen C, Peikrishvili R, Guibert J, Bouyer J |title=Long-term outcome of parenthood project during in vitro fertilization and after discontinuation of unsuccessful in vitro fertilization |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 92|issue= 1|pages= 149–56|year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18706550 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.05.067 |url=}}</ref>

===Live birth rate===
The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]] and multiple-order births such as twins and triplets are counted as one pregnancy. In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.<ref name=canadians/> Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ART/ART2006/section1.htm|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|title=2006 Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Report: Section 2|accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref> Some clinics exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to superior technique or patient selection, because it is possible to artificially increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately). Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples.

Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator, namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) summarised 2008-9 success rates for US clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age.

IVF attempts in multiple cycles result in increased cumulative live birth rates. Depending on the demographic group, one study reported 45% to 53% for three attempts, and 51% to 71% to 80% for six attempts.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99654924 Study: Sixth Time May Be Charm For In Vitro] by Patti Neighmond. ''Day to Day'', National Public Radio. 21 January 2009.</ref>

===Pregnancy rate===
Pregnancy rate may be defined in various ways. In the United States, the pregnancy rate used by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the Centers for Disease Control (and appearing in the table in the Success Rates section above) are based on fetal heart motion observed in ultrasound examinations.

===Success or failure factors===
The main potential factors that influence pregnancy (and live birth) rates in IVF have been suggested to be [[maternal age]], duration of infertility or subfertility, [[basal FSH|bFSH]] and number of oocytes, all reflecting [[ovarian function]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq015}}</ref> Optimal woman’s age is 23–39 years at time of treatment.<ref name=nice/>

====Stress====
In a 2005 Swedish study,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt L, Holstein BE, Christensen U, Boivin J |title=Communication and coping as predictors of fertility problem stress: cohort study of 816 participants who did not achieve a delivery after 12 months of fertility treatment |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=3248–56 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16006458 |doi=10.1093/humrep/dei193}}</ref> 166 women were monitored starting one month before their IVF cycles, and the results showed no significant correlation between psychological stress and IVF outcome. The study concluded with the recommendation to clinics that it might be possible to reduce the stress experienced by IVF patients during the treatment procedure by informing them of those findings. While psychological stress experienced during a cycle might not influence an IVF outcome, it is possible that the experience of IVF can result in stress that leads to depression. The financial consequences alone of IVF can influence anxiety and become overwhelming. However, for many couples, the alternative is infertility, and the experience of infertility itself can also cause extreme stress and depression.

====Biomarkers====
[[Biomarker (medicine)|Biomarkers]] that affect the pregnancy chances of IVF include:
* [[Antral follicle count]]<ref name=Broer2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms041}}</ref>

==Complications in the IVF procedure==
Possible risks may occur throughout the procedure, and depend on the specific step of the procedure. During ovarian stimulation, hyperstimulation syndrome may occur. This results in swollen, painful ovaries and some form of it (mild, moderate or severe) occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation. During egg retrieval, there’s a small chance of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures like bowel and bladder (transvaginal ultrasound aspiration) as well as difficulty in breathing, chest infection, allergic reactions to meds, or nerve damage (laproscopy). During embryo transfer, if more than one embryo is transferred there’s always a risk of multiple pregnancy, infertile couples may see this as good news but there may be risk to the embryos and to the mother such as premature delivery. [[Ectopic pregnancy]] may also occur if a fertilised egg develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes and requires immediate destruction of the foetus.

===Multiple births===

Therefore, do not change "fertilisation" to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->
The major complication of IVF is the risk of [[multiple birth]]s. This is directly related to the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer. Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, obstetrical complications, [[preterm birth|prematurity]], and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred have been enacted in some countries (e.g. Britain, Belgium) to reduce the risk of high-order multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins. A double blind, randomised study followed IVF pregnancies that resulted in 73 infants (33 boys and 40 girls) and reported that 8.7% of singleton infants and 54.2% of twins had a birth weight of < {{convert|2500|g|lb}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Olivennes F, Mannaerts B, Struijs M, Bonduelle M, Devroey P |title=Perinatal outcome of pregnancy after GnRH antagonist (ganirelix) treatment during ovarian stimulation for conventional IVF or ICSI: a preliminary report |journal=Hum.

Recent evidence also suggest that singleton offspring after IVF is at higher risk for lower birth weight for unknown reasons.

A review in 2012 came to the result that singleton pregnancies resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) is associated with a [[relative risk]] of congenital anomalies of 1.67 (95% [[confidence interval]] 1.33–2.09) compared to spontaneous pregnancies.<ref name=Pandey2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms018}}</ref> In 2008, an analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably [[septal heart defect]]s, [[cleft lip]] with or without [[cleft palate]], [[esophageal atresia]], and [[anorectal atresia]]; the mechanism of causality is unclear.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Reefhuis J, Honein MA, Schieve LA, Correa A, Hobbs CA, Rasmussen SA |title=Assisted reproductive technology and major structural birth defects in the United States |journal=Hum.

Another risk of ovarian stimulation is the development of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]], particularly if hCG is used for [[Ovulation induction#final maturation|inducing final oocyte maturation]].

If the underlying infertility is related to abnormalities in spermatogenesis, it is plausible, but too early to examine that male offspring is at higher risk for sperm abnormalities.

Regarding the potential for spread of infectious diseases, Japan's government prohibited the use of ''in vitro'' fertilisation procedures for couples in which both partners are infected with HIV.

Hideji Hanabusa, the vice president of the Ogikubo Hospital, states that together with his colleagues, he managed to develop a method through which scientists are able to remove HIV from sperm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/japan-bans-in-vitro-fertilisation-for-hiv-couples.html |title=Japan Bans in Vitro Fertilisation for HIV Couples |publisher=Infoniac.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

There are various expansions or additional techniques that can be applied in IVF, which are usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF.

===Preimplantation genetic screening or diagnosis (PGS or PGD)===
<!-- This article was started with British spelling, and therefore should remain at British spelling according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English. Therefore, do not change "fertilisation" to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->
{{Main|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been suggested to be able to be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing [[randomised controlled trial]]s came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS as measured by [[live birth rate]].<ref name=Mastenbroek2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr003 }}</ref> On the contrary, for women of [[advanced maternal age]], PGS significantly lowers the live birth rate.<ref name=Mastenbroek2011/> Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.<ref name=Mastenbroek2011/>

Still, as an expansion of IVF, patients who can benefit from PGS/PGD include:
* Couples who have a family history of inherited disease
* Couples who want to use gender selection to prevent a gender-linked disease
* Couples who already have a child with an incurable disease and need compatible cells from a second healthy child to cure the first, resulting in a "[[saviour sibling]]" that matches the sick child in [[HLA type]].<ref>Britten, Nick (2011) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8499394/Saviour-sibling-cures-sick-older-brother.html Saviour Sibling Cures Sick Older Brother] The Daily Telegraph, Health News, 7 May 2011. Retrieved 8 May 2011</ref>

PGS screens for numeral chromosomal abnormalities while PGD diagnosis the specific molecular defect of the inherited disease. In both PGS and PGD, individual cells from a pre-embryo are analysed during the IVF process. Before the transfer of a pre-embryo back to a woman's uterus, one or two cells are removed from the pre-embryos (8-cell stage). These cells are then evaluated for normality. Typically within one to two days, following completion of the evaluation, only the normal pre-embryos are transferred back to the woman's uterus. In addition, PGS can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies because fewer embryos are needed for implantation.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cryopreservation===
<!-- This article was started with British spelling, and therefore should remain at British spelling according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English. Therefore, do not change "fertilisation" to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->
{{Main|Oocyte cryopreservation|Embryo cryopreservation}}
[[Cryopreservation]] can be performed as [[oocyte cryopreservation]] before fertilisation, or as [[embryo cryopreservation]] after fertilisation.

The Rand Consulting Group has estimated there to be 400,000 frozen embryos in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/souls_on_ice.html |title=Motherjones.com |publisher=Motherjones.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> The advantage is that patients who fail to conceive may become pregnant using such embryos without having to go through a full IVF cycle. Or, if pregnancy occurred, they could return later for another pregnancy. Spare oocytes or embryos resulting from fertility treatments may be used for [[oocyte donation]] or [[embryo donation]] to another woman or couple, and embryos may be created, frozen and stored specifically for transfer and donation by using donor eggs and sperm. Also, oocyte cryopreservation can be used for women who are likely to lose their ovarian reserve due to undergoing [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Porcu E, Fabbri R, Damiano G, Fratto R, Giunchi S, Venturoli S | title=Oocyte cryopreservation in oncological patients | journal=Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol | year=2004 | pages=S14–6 | volume=113 Suppl 1 | pmid=15041124 | doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.11.004}}</ref>

The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://givf.com/embryov.cfm|archivedate=27 July 2009 |title=Genetics & IVF Institute |publisher=Givf.com |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref>

===Other expansions===
* [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (''ICSI'') is where a single [[spermatozoon|sperm]] is injected directly into an [[ovum|egg]]. Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is to overcome male [[infertility]] problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in conjunction with [[sperm donation]]. It can be used in [[teratozoospermia]], since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence [[blastocyst]] development or blastocyst morphology.<ref name=french>{{cite journal |author=French DB, Sabanegh ES, Goldfarb J, Desai N |title=Does severe teratozoospermia affect blastocyst formation, live birth rate, and other clinical outcome parameters in ICSI cycles? |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=1097–1103 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=19200957 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.051 |url=}}</ref>
* Additional methods of [[embryo profiling]]. For example, methods are emerging in making comprehensive analyses of up to entire [[genome]]s, [[transcriptome]]s, [[proteome]]s and [[metabolome]]s which may be used to score embryos by comparing the patterns with ones that have previously been found among embryos in successful versus unsuccessful pregnancies.<ref name=Fauser2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr033}}</ref>
* [[Assisted zona hatching]] (AZH) can be performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo.
*[[Luteal support]] is the administration of medication, generally [[progesterone]], [[progestin]]s or [[GnRH agonist]]s, to increase the success rate of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing and/or supporting the function of the [[corpus luteum]].
* In [[egg donation]] and [[embryo donation]], the resultant embryo after fertilisation is inserted in another woman than the one providing the eggs. These are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or [[advanced maternal age]]. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilised in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
* [[Embryo splitting (disambiguation)|Embryo splitting]] can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

==Leftover embryos or eggs==
<!-- This article was started with British spelling, and therefore should remain at British spelling according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English. Therefore, do not change "fertilisation" to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->
{{Further|Embryo donation|Egg donor}}
There may be leftover embryos or eggs from IVF procedures if the woman for whom they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies to term. With the woman's or couple's permission, these may be donated to help other women or couples as a means of [[third party reproduction]].

In [[embryo donation]], these extra embryos are given to other couples or women for [[Embryo transfer|transfer]] with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor, the same as occurs with [[egg donor|egg donation]] or [[sperm donation]].

Typically, genetic parents donate the eggs to a [[fertility clinic]] or [[embryo bank]] where they are preserved by [[oocyte cryopreservation]] or [[embryo cryopreservation]] until a carrier is found for them. Typically the process of matching the embryo(s) with the prospective parents is conducted by the agency itself, at which time the clinic transfers ownership of the embryos to the prospective parents.<ref>[http://familybuilding.resolve.org/site/PageServer?pagename=lrn_wamo_pd&JServSessionId_form=login&printer_friendly=1]</ref>

In the United States, women seeking to be an embryo recipient undergo infectious disease screening required by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and reproductive tests to determine the best placement location and cycle timing before the actual Embryo Transfer occurs. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own [[embryologist]] conduct further testing.

Alternatives to donating unused embryos are destroying them (or having them implanted at a time where pregnancy is very unlikely),<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/09/01/extra.ivf.embryos/ CNN --> What happens to extra embryos after IVF?] updated 12:32&nbsp;pm EDT, Tuesday 1 September 2009</ref> keeping them frozen indefinitely, or donating them for use in research (with results in their unviability). Individual moral views on disposing leftover embryos may depend on personal views on the [[beginning of human personhood]] and definition and/or value of [[potential person|potential future persons]] and on the value that is given to fundamental research questions. Some people believe donation of leftover embryos for research is a good alternative to discarding the embryos when patients receive proper, honest and clear information about the research project, the procedures and the scientific values).<ref>{{cite pmid|18166188}}</ref>

In October 1978, it was reported that [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (physician)|Subash Mukhopadyay]], a relatively unknown physician from [[Kolkata]], India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as "Durga" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978.<ref>The New Scientist, 18 October 1978, page 158</ref> However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101005/jsp/frontpage/story_13020013.jsp |title=Test tube triumph & tragedy – Nobel for UK scientist stirs memory of a Bengal doctor |work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community.

Steptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world’s second (confirmed) baby conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow.<ref>The Daily Telegraph, London, 15 January 1979, page 1</ref> A team led by Ian Johnston and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia’s first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne.<ref>The Times, London, 24 June 1980, page 7</ref> It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.

This was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. The [[Georgeanna Jones|Jones team]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonesinstitute.org/ |title=The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine website |publisher=Jonesinstitute.org |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> at the [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.

The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use.<ref name="pmid17177108">{{Cite journal|author=Kyono K, Uto H, Nakajo Y, Kumagai S, Araki Y, Kanto S |title=Seven pregnancies and deliveries from non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patients using fresh and frozen testicular sperm |journal=J.

Therefore, do not change "fertilisation" to "fertilization", "programme" to "program", etcetera. -->

===Mix-ups===
In a few cases, laboratory mix-ups (misidentified gametes, transfer of wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to legal action against the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example is the case of a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Ayers C | title=Mother wins $1m for IVF mix-up but may lose son| journal = Timesonline | year=2004 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article465773.ece }}</ref> This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups.  The [[HFEA]], for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system, where the identity of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce the risk of human error.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=Hull becomes the latest clinic to guard against IVF mix ups | journal = Private Healthcare UK | year= 2008 | url = http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/news/january-2008/hull-guards-against-ivf-mix-ups563/ | author1= <Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> Technological solutions typically involve tagging individual specimen containers with uniquely numbered [[RFID]] tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the USA,<ref>{{cite web|title=Reproductive Clinic Uses RFID to Guarantee Parental Identity|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?3683|work=RFIDJounal.com}}</ref> it is still not widely adopted.

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis or screening===
Another concern is that people will screen in or out for particular traits, using [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] or preimplantation genetic screening. For example, a deaf British couple, Tom and Paula Lichy, have petitioned to create a deaf baby using IVF.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lawson|first=Dominic|title=Of course a deaf couple want a deaf child|work=The Independent |date=11 March 2008|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-of-course-a-deaf-couple-want-a-deaf-child-794001.html|accessdate=Nov-12-2009 | location=London}}</ref> Some [[bioethics|medical ethicists]] have been very critical of this approach. [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] wrote that "intentionally culling out blind or deaf embryos might prevent considerable future suffering, while a policy that allowed deaf or blind parents to select ''for'' such traits intentionally would be far more troublesome."<ref>[Appel, Jacob. More 'designer' options ''The Winnipeg Sun'' 12 March 2009</ref>

===Profit desire of the industry===
Many people do not oppose the IVF practice itself (i.e. the creating of a pregnancy through "artificial" ways) but are highly critical of the current state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has now become a multi-billion industry, which is widely unregulated and prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (see [[Suleman octuplets]]). This has made international news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry "corrupt" and "greedy" saying that "One of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry," and that "What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation "The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/may/31/medicineandhealth.health | location= London | work = The Guardian  | first=Alok | last=Jha | title=Winston: IVF clinics corrupt and greedy | date= 31 May 2007}}</ref> The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr. Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of the early days of the IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: "It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort.  Now it's a first resort.  I think that's an injustice to women. I also think it can harm women in the long run."<ref>{{cite news| date = 2009‐8‐12 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/12/earlyshow/health/main5236035.shtml | work=CBS News | title= Is In Vitro Fertilization Being Overused?}}</ref>

===Pregnancy past menopause===
Although menopause is a natural barrier to further conception, IVF has allowed women to be pregnant in their fifties and sixties. Women whose uterus has been appropriately prepared receive embryos that originated from an egg of an egg donor. Therefore, although these women do not have a genetic link with the child, they have an emotional link through pregnancy and childbirth. In many cases the genetic father of the child is the woman's partner. Even after menopause the uterus is fully capable of carrying out a pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Parks, Jennifer A. | title=A closer look at reproductive technology and postmenopausal motherhood | journal=CMAJ | year=1996 | pages=1189–91 | volume=154 | issue=8 | pmid=8612255 | pmc=1487687 }}</ref>

===Same-sex couples, single and unmarried parents===
{{See also|Donor conceived person}}
A 2009 statement from the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine|ASRM]] found no persuasive evidence that children are harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's marital status or sexual orientation.<ref name=asrm2009>{{cite journal |author=The Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine |title=Access to fertility treatment by gays, lesbians, and unmarried persons |journal=Fertil.

A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had "religious-based objections to treating homosexuals to help them conceive children by artificial insemination," and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Appel JM |title=May doctors refuse infertility treatments to gay patients? |journal=Hastings Cent Rep |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=20–1 |year=2006 |pmid=16898357 |doi= 10.1353/hcr.2006.0053|url=}}</ref><ref>M.

[[Nadya Suleman]] came to international attention after having twelve embryos implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his license. State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On 1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical license be revoked effective 1 July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/25/AR2010102500617.html |title=License hearing for Octomom doctor resumes in LA |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Breuer |first=Howard |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20436389,00.html |title=Octomom's Doctor Tearfully Apologizes, Admits Mistake |work=People |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

In the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and some Australian states, donors aren't paid and can't be anonymous.

===Discarding unwanted embryos===

During the [[In_vitro_fertilisation#Embryo_selection|selection]] and [[In_vitro_fertilisation#Embryo_transfer|transfer]] phases many embryos may be discarded in favour of others. This selection may be based on criteria such as handicaps, genetic disorders, or even simply gender.<ref>http://www.lifenews.com/2011/09/06/pro-life-concerns-about-ivf-include-abortion-exploitation/</ref> This becomes a question of ethics when one factors in the fact that scientists have not defined when life begins [[Beginning_of_human_personhood|with any certainty]]. For those who believe life begins at conception, IVF becomes a moral question when multiple eggs are fertilised, begin development, and only a few are chosen for implantation.

If IVF were to involve the fertilisation of only a single egg, or at least only an amount that will be implanted, then this would not be an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time.

===Catholic objections===
{{Further|Religious response to assisted reproductive technology}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of ''in vitro'' fertilisation because, as with [[contraception]], it separates the procreative purpose of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Matrimony|marriage]] act from its unitive purpose:
{{Quote |<p>This [[Natural law#Contemporary Catholic understanding|particular doctrine]], often expounded by the [[Magisterium|magisterium of the Church]], is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act.</p>

<p>The reason is that the fundamental nature of the marriage act, while uniting husband and wife in the closest intimacy, also renders them capable of generating new life—and this as a result of laws written into the actual nature of man and of woman. And if each of these essential qualities, the unitive and the procreative, is preserved, the use of marriage fully retains its sense of true mutual love and its ordination to the supreme responsibility of parenthood to which man is called. We believe that our contemporaries are particularly capable of seeing that this teaching is in harmony with human reason.<ref name="humanae_vitae">{{cite web | location = Rome | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html | title = Humanae Vitae: Encyclical of Pope Paul VI on the Regulation of Birth, sec 12| author = Pope Paul VI | authorlink = Pope Paul VI|date= 25 July 1968|accessdate= 25 November 2008|publisher = Vatican}}</ref></p>}}

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]],
{{Quote |Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable.  They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act.  The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that "entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children."<ref name = "catechism">{{cite web| title = Catechism of the Catholic Church| url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P86.HTM | loc =section 2377|accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher = Vatican |year= 1993 | location = Rome}}</ref>}}

The Catholic Church maintains that it is not objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such couples who still wish to have children:
{{Quote |The [[Gospel]] shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil. Spouses who still suffer from infertility after exhausting legitimate medical procedures should unite themselves with the [[Christian cross|Lord's Cross]], the source of all spiritual fecundity. They can give expression to their generosity by adopting abandoned children or performing demanding services for others.<ref name="catechism" />}}

The Catholic Church nevertheless is concerned with it because "Some theologians consider this to be a replacement of the marital act, and therefore immoral."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usccb.org/prolife/programs/rlp/98rlphaa.shtml | title = Begotten Not Made: A Catholic View of Reproductive Technology | last = Haas | first = John M, PhD, STL |accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref>
