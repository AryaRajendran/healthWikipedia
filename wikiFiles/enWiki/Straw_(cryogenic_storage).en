A cryopreservation '''straw''' is a small storage device used for the [[cryogenic]] storage of liquid samples, often in a [[biobank]] or collection of sample. Their most common application is for storage of [[sperm]] for [[in-vitro fertilization]].

Ideally they should be made of a material that is chemically [[inert]], [[biocompatible]] and have physical characteristics that make them resistant to ultra-low temperatures and pressures created by their storage conditions, resulting in the expansion of liquids and [[liquid nitrogen]].<ref>Website of Cryo Bio System - manufacturer of straw storage systems www.cryobiosystem.com</ref>

== Use ==

Once the sample has been introduced into the straw, both extremities are thermally sealed using a specific device, usually supplied by the manufacturer of the consumable.<ref>TUBAFROST Work Package 2: Development of storage system(s) for frozen tissue (technical aspects). (Deliverable 2.2 February 2004)</ref>

The straws are then stored within triangular or square visotubes, which in turn fit into cylindrical or square containers known as goblets. These are then organized into a matrix of the same within an ultra-low temperature freezer or [[nitrogen tank]].

== Characteristics ==

* specifically designed for storing biological  materials at temperatures as low as -190Â°C;
* stable when submitted to sudden low temperatures (snap freezing), when held at low temperatures for long periods of time (years ) or when taken through several freeze-thaw cycles; and
* as leak proof as possible even at the lowest cryogenic temperatures.<ref>TUBAFROST Work Package 2: Development of storage system(s) for frozen tissue (technical aspects). (Deliverable 2.2 February 2004)</ref>
