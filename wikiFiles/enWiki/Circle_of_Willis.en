</ref> (also called '''Willis' Circle''', Loop of Willis, '''cerebral arterial circle''', and '''Willis Polygon''') is a [[circulatory anastomosis]] that supplies [[blood]] to the [[brain]] and surrounding structures. It is named after [[Thomas Willis]] (1621–1675), an [[England|English]] [[physician]].<ref name=Ustun>

==Anatomy==
===Components===
The Circle of Willis is a part of the [[cerebral circulation]] and is composed of the following arteries:<ref name="Purves" >{{cite book | author = Purves, Dale | coauthors = George J. Augustine, David Fitzpatrick, William C. Hall, Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, James O. McNamara, Leonard E. White | title = Neuroscience, 4th Ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | pages = 834–5 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-87893-697-7|url=http://www.sinauer.com/neuroscience4e}}</ref>
* [[Anterior cerebral artery]] (left and right)
* [[Anterior communicating artery]]
* [[Internal carotid artery]] (left and right)
* [[Posterior cerebral artery]] (left and right)
* [[Posterior communicating artery]] (left and right)

The [[basilar artery]] and [[middle cerebral arteries]], supplying the brain, are also considered part of the circle.<ref>Moore KL, Dalley AR. ''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'', 5th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Toronto. Copyright 2007</ref>

===Physiologic significance===
The arrangement of the brain's arteries into the Circle of Willis creates redundancies or [[collateral circulation|collaterals]] in the cerebral circulation. If one part of the circle becomes blocked or narrowed ([[stenosis|stenosed]]) or one of the arteries supplying the circle is blocked or narrowed, blood flow from the other [[blood vessel]]s can often preserve the cerebral perfusion well enough to avoid the symptoms of [[ischemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Boorder, Michiel J.| title = Spect measurements of regional cerebral perfusion and [[carbon dioxide]] reactivity: Correlation with cerebral collaterals in internal carotid artery occlusive disease | journal = J Neurol | volume = 253| issue = 10| pages = 1285–1291| year = 2006| pmid = 17063318| doi = 10.1007/s00415-006-0192-1 | last2 = Van Der Grond | first2 = J | last3 = Van Dongen | first3 = AJ | last4 = Klijn | first4 = CJ | last5 = Jaap Kappelle | first5 = L | last6 = Van Rijk | first6 = PP | last7 = Hendrikse | first7 = J}}</ref>

===Anatomic variation===
Considerable [[anatomic variation]] exists in the Circle of Willis. Based on a study of 1413 brains, the classic anatomy of the circle is only seen in 34.5% of cases.<ref>Bergman RA, Afifi AK, Miyauchi R, Circle of Willis. [http://www.vh.org/adult/provider/anatomy/AnatomicVariants/AnatomyHP.html Illustrated Encyclopedia of Human Anatomic Variation], URL: [http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/Cardiovascular/Text/Arteries/CircleofWillis.shtml http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/Cardiovascular/Text/Arteries/CircleofWillis.shtml]. Accessed on November 6, 2005.</ref>
In one common variation the proximal part of the [[posterior cerebral artery]] is narrow and its ipsilateral [[posterior communicating artery]] is large, so the [[internal carotid artery]] supplies the posterior cerebrum. In another variation the anterior communicating artery is a large vessel, such that a single internal carotid supplies both anterior cerebral arteries.

===Origin of arteries===
The left and right internal carotid arteries arise from the left and right common carotid arteries.

The posterior communicating artery is given off as a branch of the internal carotid artery just before it divides into its terminal branches - the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral artery forms the anterolateral portion of the Circle of Willis, while the middle cerebral artery does not contribute to the circle.

The right and left [[posterior cerebral artery|posterior cerebral arteries]] arise from the [[basilar artery]], which is formed by the left and right [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]]. The [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]] arise from the [[subclavian artery|subclavian arteries]].

The [[anterior communicating artery]] connects the two anterior cerebral arteries and could be said to arise from either the left or right side.

All arteries involved give off cortical and central branches. The central branches supply the interior of the Circle of Willis, more specifically, the Interpeduncular fossa. The cortical branches are named for the area they supply. Since they do not directly affect the Circle of Willis, they are not dealt with here.

==Pathology==
===Subclavian steal syndrome===
The redundancies that the Circle of Willis introduce can also lead to reduced cerebral perfusion.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klingelhöfer | first1 = J | last2 = Conrad | first2 = B | last3 = Benecke | first3 = R | last4 = Frank | first4 = B | title = Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of carotid-basilar collateral circulation in subclavian steal | journal = Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 1036–42 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3041649 | doi=10.1161/01.STR.19.8.1036}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lord | first1 = RS | last2 = Adar | first2 = R | last3 = Stein | first3 = RL | title = Contribution of the circle of Willis to the subclavian steal syndrome | journal = Circulation | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 871–8 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5377222 }}</ref>  In [[subclavian steal syndrome]], blood is "stolen" from the Circle of Willis to preserve blood flow to the [[upper limb]]. Subclavian steal syndrome results from a [[proximal]] [[stenosis]] (narrowing) of the [[subclavian artery]], an artery supplied by the [[aorta]] which is also the same blood vessel that eventually feeds the Circle of Willis via the [[common carotid artery]].
