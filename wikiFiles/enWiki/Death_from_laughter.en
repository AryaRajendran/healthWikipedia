'''Death from laughter''' refers to a rare instance of death, usually resulting from [[cardiac arrest]] or [[asphyxiation]], caused by a fit of [[laughter]]. Instances of death by laughter have been recorded from [[Ancient Greece]] to the modern day. The first recorded use of the alternative term ''fatal hilarity'' is from 1956.<ref>Oxford: Clarendon Press (1993). The Compact Oxford English Dictionary.</ref>
