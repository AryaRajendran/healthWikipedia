The '''tuberoinfundibular pathway''' refers to a population of dopamine neurons in the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the mediobasal [[hypothalamus]] (the 'tuberal region') that project to the [[median eminence]] (the 'infundibular region'). It is one of the four major [[dopamine]] pathways in the brain. Dopamine released at this site regulates the secretion of [[prolactin]] from the [[anterior pituitary]] gland.

Some [[antipsychotic]] drugs block dopamine in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which can cause an increase in blood [[prolactin]] levels ([[hyperprolactinemia]]). This can cause abnormal [[lactation]] (even in men), disruptions to the [[menstrual cycle]] in women, visual problems, [[headache]] and [[sexual dysfunction]].
