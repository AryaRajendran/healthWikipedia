In [[medicine]], '''bacteriuria''' denotes the presence of [[bacteria]] in [[urine]] not due to contamination from urine sample collection.

Urine is normally a sterile bodily fluid when inside the bladder, but can pick up commensals and pathogens when exiting through the urethra. Bacteria in the urine, especially [[gram-negative]] rods, usually indicate a [[urinary tract infection]] (either [[cystitis]] or [[pyelonephritis]]), although bacteriuria can also occur in [[prostatitis]]. [[Escherichia coli]] is the most common bacterium isolated from urine samples.

'''Asymptomatic bacteriuria''' is bacteriuria without accompanying symptoms of a urinary tract infection (such as [[Polyuria|frequent urination]], [[dysuria|painful urination]] or [[fever]]). It is more common in women, in the elderly, in residents of long-term care facilities, and in patients with diabetes, bladder catheters and spinal cord injuries. Patients with a long-term [[Foley catheter]] uniformly show bacteriuria.

==Diagnosis==
Bacteria can be detected with a [[urine dipstick]] test for [[urinary nitrite]] or by urinary [[microscopy]], although [[bacterial culture]] remains the most [[Specificity (tests)|specific]] and formal test (the [[Gold standard (test)|golden standard]]). Bacteriuria can be confirmed if a single bacterial species is isolated in a concentration greater than 100,000 [[colony forming unit]]s per millilitre of urine in clean-catch midstream urine specimens (one for men, two consecutive specimens with the same bacterium for women). For urine collected via bladder catheterisation, the threshold is 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre. The threshold is also 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre for women displaying UTI symptoms.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sam |first= Amir H. |coauthors= James T.H.

==Treatment==
The presence of simultaneous pyuria does not warrant treatment by itself.

* Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture and treatment with antibiotics is recommended during [[pregnancy]], because it significantly reduces symptomatic urinary tract infections, [[low birth weight]], and [[preterm delivery]].<ref name="USPSTF">{{cite journal |author=Lin K, Fajardo K |title=Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement |journal=Ann.

* [[Kidney transplant]] recipients, children with [[vesicoureteral reflux]] or others with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, people with infected kidney stones and those who are having urological procedures might be more likely to benefit from treatment with antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria.<ref name="MedlinePlus">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000520.htm Asymptomatic bacteriuria] from [[Medline Plus]].
