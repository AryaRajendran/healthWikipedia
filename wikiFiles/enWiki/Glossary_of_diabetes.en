{{Gloss}}
{{Term|term= Acanthosis nigricans |content= [[Acanthosis nigricans]] }} {{Defn|1= A brown to black, poorly defined, velvety [[hyperpigmentation]] of the [[human skin|skin]], usually present in the posterior and lateral folds of the [[neck]], the [[axilla]], [[groin]], [[navel|umbilicus]], and other areas.  This occurs due to [[insulin]] spillover (from excessive production due to obesity or [[insulin resistance]]) into the skin which results in abnormal growth being observed.  The most common cause would be [[insulin resistance]], usually from type 2 [[diabetes mellitus]].}}
{{Term|term= ACE inhibitor |content= [[ACE inhibitor]] }} {{Defn|1= [[Angiotensin]] conversion [[enzyme]]. A class of drugs used to decrease hypertension, mainly by interfering with the renin kidney—blood pressure control cycle. An example is Ramparil. (See [[Angiotensin receptor blocker|ARB]]).}}
{{Term|term= Adult-onset diabetes |content= [[Adult-onset diabetes]] }} {{Defn|1= One of the former terms for [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]]. See: Type 2 diabetes mellitus.}}
{{Term|term= Acetohexamide |content= [[Acetohexamide]] }} {{Defn|1= A pill taken to lower the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. People with Type 2 diabetes may take these pills. See also: Oral hypoglycemic agents. One of the [[sulfonylurea]] drugs. (Dymelor Dimelor)}}
{{Term|term= Acetone |content= [[Acetone]] }} {{Defn|1= A byproduct of fat metabolism. One of three ''ketone body'' substances. Produced in high levels during periods of stress, infection, etc possibly leading to [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], a very serious condition. It can sometimes be smelled on the breath of those in, or about to enter diabetic ketoacidosis as a fruity (nail polish remover, or lacquer thinner) sort of smell. It is very rapidly released into via the lungs into the breath, unlike the other ketone bodies. It is chemically a [[ketone]].}}
{{Term|term= Acidosis |content= [[Acidosis]] }} {{Defn|1= An acidic condition in body fluids, chiefly blood. If prolonged, or severe, it can cause coma and death regardless of cause. For a person with diabetes, this can be caused by insufficient glucose absorption (e.g. from inadequate insulin) combined with metabolic ketosis. It can lead to [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], a medical emergency.}}
{{Term|term= Acute |content= [[Acute (medical)|Acute]] }} {{Defn|1= Happens for a limited period of time; abrupt onset; sharp, severe.}}
{{Term|term= Adrenal gland |content= [[Adrenal gland]] }} {{Defn|1= An endocrine gland located on top of the human kidney. Secretes adrenaline, one of the primary 'fight or flight' stress hormones, which have substantial counterregulatory effects.}}
{{Term|term= Adverse effect |content= [[Adverse effect]] }} {{Defn|1= A harmful result.}}
{{Term|term= Albuminuria |content= [[Albuminuria]] }} {{Defn|1= release of the protein [[serum albumin|albumin]] in urine. As this protein is strongly conserved, this is evidence of abnormal kidney function.}}
{{Term|term= Aldose reductase inhibitor |content= [[Aldose reductase inhibitor]] }} {{Defn|1= }}
{{Term|term= Alpha cell |content= [[Alpha cell]] }} {{Defn|1= one of the types of cell in the pancreas (in areas called the Islets of Langerhans). Alpha cells make and release a hormone called glucagon, which raises the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood.}}
{{Term|term= Amino acid |content= [[Amino acid]] }} {{Defn|1= a weak acid carbon compound containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The nitrogenous amine group is characteristic of each. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and there are about 20 used in the human body, of which about half can be constructed internally. The rest must come in the diet—they are the [[essential amino acids]].}}
{{Term|term= Amyotrophy |content= [[Amyotrophy]] }} {{Defn|1= A type of diabetic [[neuropathy]] that causes muscle weakness and wasting.}}
{{Term|term= Amylin |content= [[Amylin]] }} {{Defn|1= A [[peptide]] thought to be involved in [[beta cell]] loss in type 2 diabetes.}}

{{Term|term= Anomaly |content= {{dn|Anomaly|Anomalies|date=November 2012}} }} {{Defn|1=  Abnormalities, as in birth defects, or in peculiar results or developments. For instance, diabetes can develop in an anomalous, unusual, way.}}
{{Term|term= Antibodies |content= [[Antibody|Antibodies]] }} {{Defn|1= Chemicals produced by the immune system which are very carefully tuned to attach only to particular substances in foreign bodies (eg, [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], foreign tissue, ...) When they attach to their target substances, other parts of the immune system attack and destroy the tagged protein or cell.  It is an inappropriate antibody reaction to normal proteins found on beta cells that are thought to be the main mechanism of beta cell destruction in Type 1 diabetes.}}
{{Term|term= Anti-diabetic drug |content= [[Anti-diabetic drug]] }} {{Defn|1= A kind of medication that helps a person with diabetes control the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood so that the body works as it should. See also: Insulin; oral hypoglycemic agents.}}
{{Term|term= Antigen |content= [[Antigen]] }} {{Defn|1= The substance in a foreign body which evokes production of antibodies specific to it.}}
{{Term|term= Antiseptic |content= [[Antiseptic]] }} {{Defn|1= A product that reduces the presence of infective agents.}}
{{Term|term= Angiotensisn Receptor Blocker |content= [[Angiotensin receptor blocker|ARB]] {{anchor|ARB}} }} {{Defn|1= Angiotensisn Receptor Blocker. An agent which interferes with the renin (kidney-lung-heart blood pressure control) cycle. An example is Atacand. (See [[ACE inhibitor]]).}}
{{Term|term= Arteriosclerosis |content= [[Arteriosclerosis]] }} {{Defn|1= Hardening of the blood vessels. It causes inflexibility of the arterial walls, so they are not flexible as in a healthy condition. In addition, it also usually involves [[atherosclerosis]], i.e. deposits (called plaques) on the interior surface of many arteries, which are composed of [[LDL]] and assorted other debris (including [[platelets]]). Broken pieces of those deposits or closure of the arterial opening can cause [[myocardial infarction]] or [[stroke]]. Precisely what causes it is not fully known, but diabetics have increased risk of both heart attack and stroke, so some of the tissue damage diabetes produces may be involved. Equivalent to [[atherosclerosis]].}}
{{Term|term= Artery |content= [[Artery]] }} {{Defn|1= Blood vessel with muscular walls on the 'supply side' of the blood circulation, in the network of vessels between the left ventricle output and capillary beds throughout the body.}}
{{Term|term= Artificial pancreas |content= [[Artificial pancreas]] }} {{Defn|1= A large machine used in hospitals that constantly measures glucose (sugar) in the blood and, in response, releases the right amount of insulin. Scientists are also working to develop a small unit that could be implanted in the body, functioning like a real pancreas. Note that the pancreas is a complex multi-functional organ, and replacement of properly regulated insulin production would be only partial functional duplication; it is likely that an artificial pancreas in a diabetic context would not replace an entire existing organ.}}
{{Term|term= Aspartame |content= [[Aspartame]] }} {{Defn|1= An artificial sweetener that can replace sugar in many uses. Chemically it is two amino acids and is therefore a kind of miniature protein, a very small [[peptide]]. It is sweet because, in a way not entirely clear even now, it interacts with the taste buds to cause a sweet taste.}}
{{Term|term= Asymptomatic |content= [[Asymptomatic]] }} {{Defn|1= No symptoms; no clear sign of disease present. Most Type II diabetics are without clinically obvious symptoms for some time (often years) before they are diagnosed as diabetic.}}
{{Term|term= Atherosclerosis |content= [[Atherosclerosis]] }} {{Defn|1= See: [[Arteriosclerosis]].}}
{{Term|term= Autoimmune disease |content= [[Autoimmune disease]] }} {{Defn|1= A condition in which the immune system inappropriately attacks a body tissue. Multiple sclerosis, some kinds of rheumatism, lupus, and Type 1 diabetes are examples. The reasons for the immune system misbehavior are not, in general, understood.}}
{{Term|term= Autonomic neuropathy |content= [[Autonomic neuropathy]] }} {{Defn|1= Damage to nerves that do not control senses or muscles. These nerves control 'automatic' processes, like heart rate and body temperature. They can be damaged by diabetes, just like 'regular' somatic nerves, but the results are 'system-wide', not just pain or muscle weakness. Balance, intestinal control, blood pressure regulation, sweating, breathing rate, ... are all controlled or influenced by the autonomic nervous system.}}

{{Gloss}}
{{Term|term= Background retinopathy |content= [[Diabetic retinopathy|Background retinopathy]] }} {{Defn|1= Also known as [[Diabetic retinopathy|non-proliferative retinopathy]]}}
{{Term|term= Basal rate |content= [[Basal rate]] }} {{Defn|1= A continuous supply of something. In the case of diabetes, the low levels of insulin usually maintained in the absence of perturbing events (e.g., food, infection, stress, ...).}}
{{Term|term= Beta cell |content= [[Beta cell]] }} {{Defn|1= One of the cell types found in the Islets of Langehans in the pancreas. They are the source of insulin, and contain mechanisms which watch blood glucose levels and which secrete (or not) insulin in response.}}
{{Term|term= Beta cell transplantation |content= [[Beta cell transplantation]] }} {{Defn|1= See: Islet cell transplantation.}}
{{Term|term= Biosynthetic human insulin |content= [[Biosynthetic human insulin]] }} {{Defn|1= A man-made insulin that is chemically identical to like human insulin. See also: Human insulin.}}
{{Term|term= Biphasic insulin |content= [[Biphasic insulin]] }} {{Defn|1= A type of pharmaceutical insulin that is a mixture of intermediate- and fast-acting insulin.}}
{{Term|term= Blood glucose |content= [[Glucose|Blood glucose]] }} {{Defn|1= Glucose is a simple sugar and the primary fuel for body cells. It is absorbed from some foods (or produced from starchy ones), absorbed into the cells (for about 2/3 of cells, this is under control of insulin), stored temporarily in the liver as glycogen, made in starvation from the glycerin backbone of triglycerides, and from a few amino acids. Glucose metabolism anomalies are the cause of diabetes mellitus.}}
{{Term|term= Blood glucose meter |content= [[Blood glucose meter]] }} {{Defn|1= A machine which electrochemically or coloristically, determines the current level of glucose in a blood sample. They have been getting progressively smaller and less expensive since they were first introduced. The expense of testing is primarily in the one time use strips used which are unique to each testing machine. Some machines can also measure the amount of ketones in the blood, using different testing strips, or glycosolated hemoglobin (i.e., Hb1c).}}
{{Term|term= Blood glucose monitoring |content= [[Blood glucose monitoring]] }} {{Defn|1= Tracking one's blood glucose level, usually by using a blood glucose meter. This was formerly characterized by periodic testing in a clinic or hospital. If done properly, the modern monitoring is far more useful, given the rapid changes of glucose levels as a result of meals, exercise, medication, etc.}}
{{Term|term= Blood pressure |content= [[Blood pressure]] }} {{Defn|1= The hydraulic pressure in arteries caused heart contractions (i.e., of the left ventircle). It has two values. The higher is taken immediately at the end of  the left ventricle's contraction. The lower is the 'background pressure' in the arteries when the left ventricle is not contracting. .}}
{{Term|term= Blood-sampling device |content= [[Blood-sampling device]] }} {{Defn|1= }}
{{Term|term= Blood sugar |content= [[Glucose|Blood sugar]] }} {{Defn|1= A (misnomer) name for blood glucose.}}
{{Term|term= Blood urea nitrogen |content= [[Blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN) {{anchor|BUN|Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)}} }} {{Defn|1= A measurement of a metabolic waste product in the blood. Urea is a characteristic end product of protein disassembly and processing; this continues normally as a function of tissue repair and replacement. Increased levels of BUN in the blood may indicate early kidney damage as the kidney fails to excrete it in the urine.}}
{{Term|term= Blood vessels |content= [[Blood vessel]]s }} {{Defn|1= Tubes which carry blood around the body. They come in three types, arteries, veins, and capillaries. Capillaries are always tiny, the others vary from large (centimeters in diameter) to quite small (slightly smaller than the diameter of a red blood cell).}}
{{Term|term= Bolus |content= [[Bolus (medicine)|Bolus]] }} {{Defn|1= An amount of something given in one 'lump.' A meal is a food bolus, continuous snacking for an afternoon is not. In diabetes, bolus is an extra amount of insulin given in a single dose to cover an expected rise in blood glucose (sugar), such as the rise that occurs after eating.}}
{{Term|term= Borderline Diabetes |content= [[Borderline Diabetes]] }} {{Defn|1= A term no longer used. See: Impaired glucose tolerance.}}
{{Term|term= Brittle diabetes |content= [[Brittle diabetes]] }} {{Defn|1= A person with a blood glucose (sugar) level often swings quickly from high to low and from low to high. Also called labile and unstable diabetes.}}
{{Term|term= Bronze diabetes |content= [[Bronze diabetes]] }} {{Defn|1= See: [[Hemochromatosis]].}}
{{Term|term= Bunion |content= [[Bunion]] }} {{Defn|1= A bump or bulge on the first joint of the big toe caused by the swelling of a sac of fluid under the skin.}}

{{Glossend}}

== C ==
{{Gloss}}
{{Term|term= C.D.E. }} {{Defn|1= See: [[#Certified diabetes educator]].}}
{{Term|term= C-peptide |content= [[C-peptide]] }} {{Defn|1= A substance the pancreas releases into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin. While being stored in pancreatic [[beta cell]]s, proinsulin includes both insulin and C-peptide, which is freed before insulin secretion into the blood. Currently, since pharmaceutical insulin does not contain C-peptide, a C-peptide level test will show how much insulin the body is making. Insulin is prepared as two insulin molecules linked by a c-peptide. When insulin is secreted, C-peptide is released as well. It has in recent years been shown to have hormone properties, so far chiefly in connection with arterial vessel muscle tone. It has been shown to ameliorate some diabetic complications, such as neuropathy and microvascular damage. C-peptide varies much more between animal species than does insulin itself.}}
{{Term|term= Calcium channel blocker |content= [[Calcium channel blocker]] }} {{Defn|1= Calcium ions are used in many cells, including beta cells, as a signaling mechanism. Since it does not ordinarily pass through cell membranes, protein pores in cell membranes are used to provide a channel through which it can be 'pumped' -- an activity which requires energy if done against a concentration gradient. A Ca+ channel blocker is a drug which interferes with the operation of (some?) such channels. They have widespread effects, since Ca+ is used for many purposes in assorted tissues.}}
{{Term|term= Callus |content= [[Callus]] }} {{Defn|1= A small area of skin, usually on the foot, that has become thick and hard from rubbing or pressure as a result of increased production of surface skin (i.e., the topmost living cell layer); the callus itself is the result of this overgrowth and is itself a thickened 'dead cell surface layer'. Podiatry defines a callus as a skin lesion, and if it becomes cracked or internally separates, infection can follow, often with no warning signs. Calluses may lead to other problems such as serious infection. Shoes that fit well aid in reducing callus formation as they reduce localized rubbing and friction. Calluses are important risk factors for diabetics, in part because of changes in skin or vasculature characteristic of feet and lower legs in diabetics. See also: Foot care.}}
{{Term|term= Calorie |content= [[Calorie]] }} {{Defn|1= a measure of the chemical [[energy]] in a specific amount of material. The food Calorie (resulting from combustion with oxygen from the atmosphere) is 1000x the calorie used in heat studies (i.e., in [[physics]]). Not all calories in food are actually usable. For instance, sawdust is largely cellulose (i.e., glucoses stuck together in long chains), and can be burned in a calorimeter (a common method of determining calorie content), but the human body contains no mechanism to convert it to its component glucoses for use as fuel. Calories relevant to diet (and so to diabetics) come only from those substances in food which can actually be used by the body. Thus, protein is not normally used for fuel, and so should not be counted as a food calorie in normal situations; nevertheless, it is usually  taken into account. In a calorimeter (and in most diet references) all protein and carbohydrate is worth 4 calories/gram, while fat/oils are worth 9 calories/gram, and various alcohols and other (largely artificial) chemicals are worth fewer. A [[gram]] is about 1/25 of an [[ounce]] for those more familiar with English measures. The amount of usable calories in food is less than the amount measured in a calorimeter, and requires more care to determine. For instance, starch in plant foods is not readily available to be processed in digestion. Cooked starch (especially when cooked in the presence of moisture) is far more available digestively than raw starch (perhaps 60% vs nearly 100%).}}
{{Term|term= Capillary |content= [[Capillary]] }} {{Defn|1= a very small blood vessel. At one end of a capillary is a connection to the body's arteries and at the other end of a capillary is a connection to the body's veins. It is in the capillaries that most gas exchange takes place ([[oxygen]] out of the blood into the tissues, and [[carbon dioxide]] into the blood). The reverse exchange happens in the capillaries of the lungs. Capillaries are controlled by very small muscles which, together, affect blood pressure very substantially. Those muscles are in turn controlled by, among other things, the presence or absence of insulin (and probably C-peptide) in the blood.}}
{{Term|term= Capsaicin |content= [[Capsaicin]] }} {{Defn|1= a substance found in some plant products, especially hot peppers, which causes human nerves to report a hot sensation.}}
{{Term|term= Carbohydrate |content= [[Carbohydrate]] }} {{Defn|1= Any compound containing [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], sometimes [[oxygen]]. There is considerable variety in these compounds and only some of them are available to humans as a fuel source. Cellulose, for instance, is a carbohydrate, but humans and all non-cud chewing animals (except termites and some microorganisms) can make no use of it. Only a few of the simple sugars (mono-saccharides) and even fewer of the di-saccharides (e.g., lactose) in food are available to humans. Others, if they contribute to human nutrition, do so after processing by intestinal bacteria (some estimates are that, in humans, less than 10% of caloric benefit comes from fermentation in the large intestine, as contrasted to other primates in which the proportion is rather larger). Most carbohydrates that can be absorbed and used for fuel by humans (e.g., starch and glycogen—both chains of glucose molecules).are eventually broken down to glucose during digestion. They eventually are part of the primary metabolic control mechanism. Fructose, on the other hand, is a carbohydrate which is neither; it is absorbed, but in humans processed only in  the [[liver]] and in [[sperm]], the only tissues which have the required enzymes. Ingested carbohydrate calories in non glucose forms are, in a special sense, invisible to the body. There has been recent speculation that the increase in such carbohydrates since [[sucrose]] (table sugar—half glucose and half fructose) became available in quantity after about 1700 with the discovery of a practical source ([[sugar cane]]), accounts for some of the diseases of civilization, including diabetes. Fructose had been quite rare in human diet until that time. Dietary fructose also characteristically causes alterations in blood lipid profiles, probably by changing liver operations.}}
{{Term|term= Cardiologist |content= [[Cardiology|Cardiologist]] }} {{Defn|1= a physician with special training for treating heart and circulatory problems.}}
{{Term|term= Cardiovascular |content= [[Circulatory system|Cardiovascular]] }} {{Defn|1= pertaining to the heart and vascular system (blood vessels).}}
{{Term|term= Carpal tunnel syndrome |content= [[Carpal tunnel syndrome]] }} {{Defn|1= irritation and swelling of one of more of the nerves in the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Effects range from considerable pain to loss of strength or muscle control. The cause is thought to be mechanical, as in repetitive motion of the wrist joint as in typing while in inappropriate wrist positions.}}
{{Term|term= Cataract |content= [[Cataract]] }} {{Defn|1= clouding of the transparent protein in the lens of the eye. A certain amount of this clouding occurs naturally during life. The elderly do not, therefore see quite the same way as they used to since there is a slight yellowish cast in the clouded lens.  Diabetics have an increased risk for cataract since high levels of glucose cause reactions with assorted proteins, including those in the lens; many of the reaction products are not optically clear, nor pack in the same way, thus altering the shape of the lens. There are both acute (changes more or less rapidly with changes in blood glucose), and chronic (longer term, slower changing) lens shape changes in diabetics, making eye examinations -- for vision correction, for instance -- somewhat tricky.}}
{{Term|term= Cerebrovascular disease |content= [[Cerebrovascular disease]] }} {{Defn|1= damage to the blood vessels in the brain, resulting in a stroke -- either ischemic (a blocked blood vessel) or hemorrhagic (i.e., a leaking blood vessel). People with diabetes are at higher risk of cerebrovascular disease.}}
{{Term|term= Certified diabetes educator |content= [[Certified diabetes educator]] (C.D.E.) {{anchor|C.D.E.|CDE|Certified diabetes educator (C.D.E.)}} }} {{Defn|1= a health care professional who is qualified by the American Association of Diabetes Educators to teach people with diabetes how to manage their condition. In the US, the health care team for diabetes should ideally include a diabetes educator, preferably a C.D.E.}}
{{Term|term= Charcot foot |content= [[Neuropathic joint disease|Charcot foot]] }} {{Defn|1= a foot complication associated with diabetic neuropathy that results in destruction of joints and soft tissue. Also called "Charcot's joint", "neuropathic arthropathy", and "neuropathic joint disease". Named for a Parisian physician [[Jean-Martin Charcot]].}}
{{Term|term= Chemical diabetes }} {{Defn|1= is a term that is no longer used. See: Impaired glucose tolerance.}}
{{Term|term= Chlorpropamide |content= [[Chlorpropamide]] }} {{Defn|1= a pill taken to lower the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Only people with Type 2 diabetes take these pills. They are inappropriate for Type 1 diabetics as they increase the beta cell output of insulin which is normally missing in Type 1 diabetics due to beta cell destruction; there is no insulin production to be increased. See also: Oral hypoglycemic agents. This is one of the sulfonylureas (Diabinese).}}
{{Term|term= Cholesterol |content= [[Cholesterol]] }} {{Defn|1= a waxy substance related to the steroid chemicals which serves as a substrate for many things including cell membrane construction. It is also involved in the transport of fat (i.e., lipids) in the blood. The transport mechanism (Low Density Cholesterol or High Density Cholesterol particles) varies, and not only in density. HDL is associated with the scavenging of [[atherosclerosis|plaque]] on arterial walls, while LDL is associated with deposition of such plaque. High cholesterol levels are statistically correlated with vessel disease and with heart attack in most, but not all, human populations. Cholesterol is manufactured in the body and is absorbed from food in the diet. Furthermore, some diet elements seem to be connected with higher body production of cholesterol (e.g., saturated fat).}}
{{Term|term= Chronic |content= [[chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] }} {{Defn|1= present over a long period of time. Diabetes and arthritis are examples of chronic diseases as there is yet no cure for either.}}
{{Term|term= Circulation |content= [[Circulatory system|Circulation]] }} {{Defn|1= the structures and control mechanisms which manage blood circulation. It includes the heart, lungs, arteries, veins, and capillaries, as well as several physical mechanisms (e.g., the [[Starling's law]] response of heart muscle) and hormone mechanism (e.g., the [[renin]] to [[angiotension]] linkage between the kidneys, lungs, heart, and blood pressure).}}
{{Term|term= Clinical trial |content= [[Clinical trial]] }} {{Defn|1= a study carried out in humans (generally using volunteers) to answer a question such as whether a new treatment (or drug or exercise technique) is effective or safe as treatment. In the US, studies are broken into Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III trials. A properly designed study is carefully controlled and designed to produce reliable information. A poorly designed study does not produce reliable information, though its 'results' are often widely cited for various reasons (including commercial ones). Distinguishing between these is difficult or impossible for the non-specialist, and even for many specialists. For diabetes, industry organizations (e.g., the American Diabetes Association) maintain review committees which evaluate the results of many studies relevant to diabetes.}}
{{Term|term= Coma |content= [[Coma]] }} {{Defn|1= unconsciousness. For a diabetic, coma can be caused by hypoglycemia or by diabetic ketoacidosis.}}
{{Term|term= Comatose |content= [[Coma]]tose }} {{Defn|1= in a coma; not conscious.}}
{{Term|term= Complications of diabetes |content= [[Complications of diabetes]] }} {{Defn|1= harmful effects that may happen when a person has diabetes. Some acute effects, such as [[hypoglycemia]] or [[hyperglycemia]], can happen any time and usually can be resolved quickly. Others develop when a person has had diabetes for a time (often years, or even decades). These include damage to the retina of the eye ([[retinopathy]]), blood vessels ([[angiopathy]]), the nervous system ([[neuropathy]]), or the kidneys ([[nephropathy]]). Multiple studies very clearly show that keeping blood glucose levels as close to the normal, nondiabetic range as possible does very significantly help prevent, slow, or delay the long-term complications of diabetes (e.g., eye, kidney, blood vessel, and nerve damage).}}
{{Term|term= Congenital defect |content= [[Congenital defect]] }} {{Defn|1= problems or conditions that are present at birth.}}
{{Term|term= Congestive heart failure |content= [[Congestive heart failure]] }} {{Defn|1= heart failure caused by loss of pumping power by the heart, resulting in fluids collecting in the body. If in the lungs, it is often called Chronic Pulmonary Edema.}}
{{Term|term= Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion |content= [[Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion]] (CSII) {{anchor|CSII|Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)}} }} {{Defn|1= See: [[Insulin pump]].}}
{{Term|term= Contraindication |content= [[Contraindication]] }} {{Defn|1= A condition that makes a treatment not helpful or even harmful.}}
{{Term|term= Controlled disease |content= [[Controlled disease]] }} {{Defn|1= taking care of oneself so that a disease has a reduced adverse effect on the body. People with diabetes can "control" the disease by staying on their diets, by exercising, by taking medicine if is prescribed, by regular exercise, and by monitoring their blood glucose. This care will help keep the glucose (sugar) level in the blood from becoming either too high or too low, reducing or eliminating acute problems, and if sustained over a long time, reduce the chance of chronic problems as well.}}
{{Term|term= Conventional therapy |content= [[Conventional therapy]] }} {{Defn|1= a system of diabetes management practiced by most people with diabetes who are treated by medically qualified personnel; the system consists of one or more insulin injections each day, daily self-monitoring of blood glucose, and a standard (or prescribed) program of nutrition and exercise. The main objective in this form of treatment is to avoid very high and very low blood glucose (sugar). Contrast w/ close control or intensive therapy. Also called: "Standard Therapy." See [[complications of diabetes]].}}
{{Term|term= Coronary disease |content= [[Ischaemic heart disease|Coronary disease]] }} {{Defn|1= interference with the heart's blood supply, typically by clogging of coronary, or other, arteries. Ischemia means lack of oxygen which necessarily follows from one or more blocked arteries.}}
{{Term|term= Coxsackie B4 virus |content= [[Coxsackie B4 virus]] }} {{Defn|1= a virus which can trigger an auto-immune reaction which eventually results in a (mistaken) auto-immune attack on the beta cells. It is one of several such triggers, including other viruses. Some chemicals preferentially and directly attack the beta cells, and do not trigger the auto-immune attack (for instance a commercially used rat poison). If they are destroyed, the person becomes a Type I diabetic, no longer producing insulin internally.}}
{{Term|term= Creatinine |content= [[Creatinine]] }} {{Defn|1= a chemical normally found in the body. Its clearance rate by the kidney is a measure of [[renal function]].}}
{{Term|term= Cyclamate |content= [[Cyclamate]] }} {{Defn|1= a man-made chemical used instead of sugar in low calorie foods and drinks. Banned in the US (due to concerns about cancer risk increase in heavy users), not banned in Canada, Japan and the EU, even so. There are disagreements about the meaning of the clinical studies which caused concern.}}

== D ==
{{Gloss}}
{{Term|term= Dawn phenomenon |content= [[Dawn phenomenon]] }} {{Defn|1= A sudden rise in blood glucose levels in the early morning hours. This condition sometimes occurs in people with type 1 (formerly known as insulin-dependent) diabetes and (rarely) in people with type 2 (formerly known as noninsulin-dependent) diabetes. Unlike the Somogyi effect, it is not a result of an insulin reaction. People who have high levels of blood glucose in the mornings before eating may need to monitor their blood glucose during the night. If blood glucose levels are rising, adjustments in evening snacks or insulin dosages may be recommended. See also: Somogyi effect.}}
{{Term|term= Debridement |content= [[Debridement]] }} {{Defn|1= The removal of infected, hurt, or dead tissue. it is necessary to deprive bacteria of a growth medium and to provide intact tissues a 'clean' surface on which they can begin to repair damage.}}
{{Term|term= Dehydration |content= [[Dehydration]] }} {{Defn|1= loss of fluid in the body (usually water) resulting in abnormal concentrations of substances in the blood and fluids. Too high concentrations interfere with many body processes. Insufficient fluid intake, or excessive urine output or both, are the usual causes.}}
{{Term|term= Delta cell |content= [[Delta cell]] }} {{Defn|1= A type of cell in the pancreas clumped with other cells (in the islets of Langerhans). Delta cells make somatostatin, a hormone that is believed to control how the beta cells make and release insulin and how the alpha cells make and release glucagon.}}
{{Term|term= Desensitization |content= [[Desensitization (medicine)|Desensitization]] }} {{Defn|1= A method to reduce or stop an allergic reaction to something. Success is variable for reasons unknown.}}
{{Term|term= Dextrose |content= Dextrose (see [[#Glucose]]) }} {{Defn|1= a variety of glucose. Glucose, like many biochemicals comes in different isomers. In biological tissues throughout the earth, only the dexter form is produced and used.}}
{{Term|term= DESMOND |content= [[DESMOND (diabetes)|DESMOND]] }} {{Defn|1= A [[National Health Service|NHS]] training course for newly diagnosed diabetics freely available in the UK.}}
{{Term|term= Diabetes control and complications trial |content= [[Diabetes control and complications trial]] (DCCT) {{anchor|DCCT|Diabetes control and complications trial (DCCT)}} }} {{Defn|1= A 10-year study (1983&ndash;1993) funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to assess the effects of intensive therapy on the long-term complications of diabetes. The study very clearly showed that intensive management (i.e., close control) of insulin-dependent diabetes prevents or slows the development of the long-term complications of diabetes (eye, kidney, and nerve damage caused by diabetes), essentially to the 'normal' level.}}

Possibilities include saturated (the usual case in animal source fats), mono or poly unsaturated (from many plant oils, have one (mono) or more (poly) double carbon bonds in the fatty acid chain), and in where the double bond is (at the omega carbon in the 3 position, or the 6 position or ...). Some fats are required in the human diet, they are the 'essential oils'. All other fats humans need can be made, at the cost of some energy, from those fats, or from other chemicals. Transfats are a class of fats which are very rare in nature, but very common in industrially processed oils as a consequence of "hydrogenation". It is becoming increasingly clear that ingestion of more than small quantities of transfats distorts some aspects of human biochemistry in ways which increase artery disease and heart disease, and so increase death rates. Saturated rats have a much smaller deleterious health effect.}}

{{Term|term= Insulin allergy |content= [[Insulin allergy]] }} {{Defn|1= This occurs when a person's body has an allergic or bad reaction to taking insulin made from non-human insulin (e.g., from pork or beef or from bacteria). the reaction can be because the insulin is not exactly the same as human insulin or because it has impurities. The allergy can be of two forms. In one, sometimes an area of skin becomes red and itchy around the place where the insulin is injected. This is called a local allergy. In another, there is a wider reaction, involving the blood or other organs. This is called a systemic allergy. The result can be hives or red patches all over the skin or may feel changes in heart rate or breathing rate. A doctor may treat the underlying allergy by prescribing purified insulins or by desensitization. The acute symptoms may also require treatment, possibly by anti-histamines. See also: Desensitization.}}
{{Term|term= Insulin antagonist |content= [[Insulin antagonist]]s }} {{Defn|1= Something that opposes or fights the action of insulin. Insulin lowers the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood, whereas [[glucagon]] raises it. Glucagon is, therefore, an antagonist of insulin.}}
{{Term|term= Insulin binding |content= [[Insulin binding]] }} {{Defn|1= When insulin attaches itself to something else. This can occur in two ways. First, when a cell needs energy, insulin can bind with a special purpose receptor on the surface of a cell (about 2/3 of human body cells, including muscles, but not including nerve cells). The cell then can bring glucose (sugar) inside; thus enabling energy production in the cell. Some cells can store glucose internally (liver cells and muscle cells primarily), but others, most importantly, nerve cells, cannot. With the help of insulin, the cell can absorb 'fuel' and proceed to do its work. But sometimes the body acts against itself. In this second case, the insulin binds with the proteins that are supposed to tag antigens (substances or fragments of cells) which are foreign to the body (i.e., antibodies). If the insulin is an injected form and not made internally, the body may see the insulin as an outside or "foreign" substance. When the foreign insulin binds with the antibodies, it does cannot work as intended.}}

{{Term|term= Insulin reaction |content= [[Insulin reaction]] }} {{Defn|1= Too low a level of blood glucose (i.e., 'sugar') in the blood; also called hypoglycemia. This occurs when a person with diabetes has injected too much insulin, eaten too little food, or exercised without compensating for the increased glucose uptake caused by exercise. The person may feel hungry, nauseated, weak, nervous, shaky, confused, and sweaty. Eating small amounts of glucose converting sugar or [[starch]] ([[glucose]], [[sucrose]] (1/2 glucose) or starch (all glucose)), sweet juice with glucose or sucrose, or food with such sugar will usually help the person feel better within 10&ndash;15 minutes. Fat or protein in the food or drink will delay absorption and should be avoided. So a glucose tablet is ideal, a candy bar or pastry is not (both contain fat in addition to starch and usually sugar). Orange juice works, but less well than intended, as its main carbohydrate is [[fructose]]. See also: Hypoglycemia; insulin shock.}}

The result is that the beta cells can no longer regulate body metabolism correctly.}}
{{Term|term= Insulin shock |content= [[Insulin shock]] }} {{Defn|1= A severe condition that occurs when the level of blood glucose (sugar) drops too far and quickly. The signs are shaking, sweating, dizziness, double vision, convulsions, and collapse. Insulin shock may occur when an insulin reaction is not treated quickly enough.

They were noticed by Paul Langerhans, a German medical student, in 1869; these clusters throughout the pancreas serve several functions. There are currently five known types of cells in an islet: beta cells, which make insulin and C-peptide; alpha cells, which make glucagon; delta cells, which make somatostatin; F cells which make pancreatic polypeptide, and D1 cells, about which little is known. The names of the cell types vary with location; in the UK they have slightly different names than in the US.}}

{{Term|term= Diabetes mellitus type 1 |content= [[Diabetes mellitus type 1]] }} {{Defn|1= It is a chronic condition in which the pancreas makes little or no insulin because the beta cells have been destroyed. About two-thirds of body cells require insulin to absorb glucose and in its absence, they will not be able to use the glucose (blood sugar) for energy. Type 1 diabetes usually comes on abruptly, although the damage to the beta cells may begin much earlier. Typical signs of Type 1 diabetes are a great thirst, hunger, a need to urinate often, and loss of weight. To treat the disease, the person must inject insulin and test blood glucose frequently.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/Introduction-to-diabetes/Treating_diabetes/</ref> Type 1 diabetes usually occurs in children and adults who are under age 30. This type of diabetes used to be known as "insulin-dependent diabetes," "juvenile diabetes," "juvenile-onset diabetes" and "ketosis-prone diabetes."}}
{{Term|term= Diabetes mellitus type 2 |content= [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]] }} {{Defn|1= The most common form of diabetes mellitus; about 90 to 95 percent of people who have diabetes in the developed world have Type 2 diabetes. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas makes no insulin, people with Type 2 diabetes produce some insulin, sometimes even large amounts. However, either their bodies do not produce enough insulin or their body cells are resistant to insulin (see Insulin Resistance). People with Type 2 diabetes can often control their condition by losing weight through diet and exercise. If not, they may need to combine insulin or a pill with diet and exercise. Generally, Type 2 diabetes occurs in people who are over age 40. Most of the people who have this type of diabetes are overweight. This type of diabetes used to be known as "noninsulin-dependent diabetes," "adult-onset diabetes," "maturity-onset diabetes," "ketosis-resistant diabetes" and "stable diabetes."}}
