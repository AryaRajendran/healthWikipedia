'''Exner syndrome''', also known as ''serpentine fibula polycystic kidney syndrome'',<ref>{{OMIM|600330|SERPENTINE FIBULA-POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY SYNDROME}}</ref> is a rare disorder, typified by the afflicted person having oddly formed, s-shaped fibulas as well as the development of numerous [[cysts]] in the kidneys.<ref>{{cite web|title=SERPENTINE FIBULA-POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY SYNDROME|url=http://www.hajdu-cheney.com%2FArticles%2FSerpentine%2520Fibula-Polycystic%2520Kidney%2520Syndrome.pdf|last=Date|first=C|work=600330 SERPENTINE FIBULA-POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY SYNDROME|publisher=NCBI|accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>

==Overview==

The syndrome was discovered in June, 1988 by Dr. G. Exner,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Exner GU |title=Serpentine fibula—polycystic kidney syndrome. A variant of the Melnick-Needles syndrome or a distinct entity? |journal=Eur J Pediatr. |volume=147 |issue=5 |pages=544–6 |year=1988 |month=Jun |pmid=3409932 }}</ref> a researcher at Orthopädische Universitätsklinik Balgrist in [[Zürich|Zurich, Switzerland]]. Exner officially named the disorder serpentine fibula polycystic kidney syndrome, but the term "Exner syndrome" became more prevalent. While some research links it to other, related disorders,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramos FJ, Kaplan BS, Bellah RD, Zackai EH, Kaplan P |title=Further evidence that the Hajdu-Cheney syndrome and the "serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome" are a single entity |journal=Am J Med Genet. |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=474–81 |year=1998 |month=Aug |pmid=9714016 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19980806)78:5<474::AID-AJMG14>3.0.CO;2-C |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/33521/PDFSTART}}</ref> most research suggests that Exner syndrome is very distinct.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Majewski F, Enders H, Ranke MB, Voit T |title=Serpentine fibula—polycystic kidney syndrome and Melnick-Needles syndrome are different disorders |journal=Eur J Pediatr. |volume=152 |issue=11 |pages=916–21 |year=1993 |month=Nov |pmid=8276023 |doi=10.1007/BF01957530 }}</ref>

==Symptoms==

All of the following are usual elements of the syndrome:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosser EM, Mann NP, Hall CM, Winter RM |title=Serpentine fibula syndrome: expansion of the phenotype with three affected siblings |journal=Clin Dysmorphol. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=105–13 |year=1996 |month=Apr |pmid=8723560 |doi=10.1097/00019605-199604000-00002 }}</ref>

* [[Short stature]]
* Abnormal [[Fibula|calf bone]] shape (fibula)
* Unusual facial appearance
* Polycystic [[kidneys]]
* Abnormally long fibula
* Mild [[Pectus excavatum|sunken chest]]
* Large corneas
* [[Inguinal hernia]]
* [[Umbilical hernia]]

==Diagnosis==

Exner syndrome is sometimes misdiagnosed as [[interstitial cystitis]] in its very early stages, but once the fibula begins to malform, Exner is the only real diagnosis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oeijord|first=Nils|title=Genetic Catastrophe!
