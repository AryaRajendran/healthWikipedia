'''Mohs surgery''', also known as '''chemosurgery''', developed in 1938 by a [[general surgeon]], Dr. [[Frederic E. Mohs]], is microscopically controlled surgery used to treat common types of [[skin cancer]].  During the surgery, after each removal of tissue, while the patient waits, the pathologist examines the tissue specimen for cancer cells, and that examination informs the surgeon where to remove tissue next. The surgeon performing the procedure is also the pathologist reading the specimen slides. Mohs surgery is one of the many methods of obtaining complete margin control during removal of a skin cancer ([[CCPDMA]]{{spaced ndash}}complete circumferential peripheral and deep margin assessment.<ref>http://wwwu.tsgh.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/commcpc/images/nccn/Non-Melanoma%20Skin%20Cancer-2007.pdf</ref><ref>http://wwwu.tsgh.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/commcpc/images/nccn/dfsp%20NCCN%202004.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Basal Cell and Squamous Cell Skin Cancers |publisher=[[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] |pages=BCC–2, BCC–3 |url=http://wwwu.tsgh.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/commcpc/images/nccn/Non-Melanoma%20Skin%20Cancer-2007.pdf |date=November 12, 2006 |isbn=0-683-08888-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Dhingra N, Gajdasty A, Neal JW, Mukherjee AN, Lane CM |title=Confident complete excision of lid‐margin BCCs using a marginal strip: an alternative to Mohs' surgery |journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=794–6 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17229804 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2006.109892 |pmc=1955612}}</ref>) using [[frozen section]] [[histology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bentkover SH, Grande DM, Soto H, Kozlicak BA, Guillaume D, Girouard S |title=Excision of head and neck basal cell carcinoma with a rapid, cross-sectional, frozen-section technique |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=114–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12020207 |doi=10.1001/archfaci.4.2.114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Minton TJ |title=Contemporary Mohs surgery applications |journal=Current Opinion in Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=376–80 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18626258 |doi=10.1097/MOO.0b013e3283079cac}}</ref>  [[CCPDMA]] or Mohs surgery allows for the removal of a skin cancer with very narrow [[surgical margin]] and a high cure rate.

Other indications for Mohs surgery include [[dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans]], [[keratoacanthoma]], spindle cell tumors, [[sebaceous carcinoma]]s, [[microcystic adnexal carcinoma]], [[merkel cell carcinoma]], [[Paget's disease of the breast]], [[atypical fibroxanthoma]], [[leiomyosarcoma]], and [[angiosarcoma]].<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |pages=193–203 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> Because the Mohs procedure is micrographically controlled, it provides precise removal of the cancerous tissue, while healthy tissue is spared. Mohs surgery is also more cost effective to other surgical methods when considering the cost of surgical removal, and separate histopathological analysis. However, Mohs surgery should be reserved for the treatment of skin cancers in anatomic areas where tissue preservation is of upmost importance (Face, hands, feet, genitals).

==History==
Originally, Dr. Mohs used an [[eschar]]otic agent made of [[zinc chloride]] and [[bloodroot]] (the root of the plant [[Sanguinaria|''Sanguinaria canadensis'']], which contains the alkaloid [[sanguinarine]]). The original ingredients were 40.0 gm Stibnite, 10.0 gm Sanguinaria canadensis, and 34.5 ml of saturated zinc chloride solution.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mohs |first=Frederic Edward |title=Chemosurgery: microscopically controlled surgery for skin cancer |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1978 |pages=3–6 |isbn=978-0-398-03725-3}}</ref> This paste is very similar to "Hoxsey's paste" (see [[Hoxsey Therapy]]). Harry Hoxsey, a lay cancer specialist was developing a herbal tonic and paste designed to treat internal and external cancers. 
Hoxsey recommended applying paste to the affected area and within days to weeks, the area would necrose (cell death), separate from surrounding tissue and fall out. Dr. Mohs applied a very similar paste after experimenting with a number of compounds to the wound of his skin cancer patients. They were to leave the paste on the wound overnight, and the following day, the skin cancer and surrounding skin would be anesthetized, and ready to be removed. The specimen was then excised, and the tissue examined under the microscope. If cancer remained, more paste was applied, and the patient would return the following day. Later, local anesthetic and frozen section histopathology applied to fresh tissue allowed the procedure to be performed the same day, with less tissue destruction, and similar cure rate.<ref name=Mikhail1991p3-4>{{Cite book|first1=George R. |last1=Mikhail |first2=Frederic Edward |last2=Mohs |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |pages=3–4 |isbn=978-0-7216-3415-9}}</ref> The term "chemosurgery" remains today, and is used synonymously with Mohs micrographic surgery.

==Mohs procedure==
The Mohs procedure is essentially a pathology sectioning method that allows for the complete examination of the surgical margin. It is different from the standard bread loafing technique of sectioning,<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |pages=112–3 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> where random samples of the surgical margin are examined.<ref name=Mikhail1991p3-4/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bowen GM, White GL, Gerwels JW |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |journal=American Family Physician |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=845–8 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16156344 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=16156344}}</ref>

Mohs surgery is performed in four steps:
* Surgical removal of tissue (Surgical Oncology)
* Mapping the piece of tissue, freezing and cutting the tissue between 5 and 10 [[micrometer]]s using a [[cryostat]], and staining with [[hematoxylin and eosin stain|hematoxylin and eosin]] (H&E) or other stains (including Toluidine Blue)
* Interpretation of microscope slides (Pathology)
* Possible reconstruction of the surgical defect (Reconstructive Surgery)

The procedure is usually performed in a physician's office under local anesthetic. A small scalpel is utilized to cut around the visible tumor. A very small surgical margin is utilized, usually with 1 to 1.5&nbsp;mm of "free margin" or uninvolved skin. The amount of free margin removed is much less than the usual 4 to 6&nbsp;mm required for the standard excision of skin cancers.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Susan E. |last1=O'Reilly |first2=Meg |last2=Knowling |date=March 4, 2005 |title=Basal Cell Carcinoma |url=http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/CancerManagementGuidelines/Skin/NonMelanoma/ManagementPolicies/start.htm |work=Cancer Management Guidelines |publisher=[[BC Cancer Agency]]}}</ref> After each surgical removal of tissue, the specimen is processed, cut on the [[cryostat]] and placed on slides, stained with H&E and then read by the Mohs surgeon/pathologist who examines the sections for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, its location is marked on the map (drawing of the tissue) and the surgeon removes the indicated cancerous tissue from the patient. This procedure is repeated until no further cancer is found. The vast majority of cases are then reconstructed by the Mohs surgeon, and members of the American College of Mohs Surgery are responsible for performing the majority of facial reconstructive surgery following skin cancer removal.

The method is well described in current references.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |pages=1111–7 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |pages=49–66 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first1=George R. |last1=Mikhail |first2=Frederic Edward |last2=Mohs |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |publisher=W.B.

If one imagines an aluminum pie pan as the blood covered surgical margin, and the top of the pie is the crust covered surface of the skin{{spaced ndash}}the goal is to flatten the aluminum pie pan into one flat sheet, mark it, stain it, and examine it under the microscope. Another author uses the example of peeling the skin off an orange.<ref name=Maloney1999p113>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |page=113 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> Imagine an orange cut in half as the CCPDMA layer. The peel is the surgical margin. One can remove this peel and flatten it out on a glass slide to examine the roots of the invasive cancer. The mapping is simply how one stains and labels the sections for a microscopic examination. The sections can be processed in one piece<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |pages=83–4 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> (using relaxing incisions at multiple points, or hemisectioned like a "Pac-Man" figure),<ref name="Mosby">{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |pages=86–9 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> cut in halves, cut in quarters, or cut in multiple pieces. Single piece processing is acceptable for small cancers, and multiple piece sectioning facilitates processing and prevent artifacts. Single piece sectioning prevents errors introduced by soft, hard-to-handle tissue; or from accidental dropping or mislabeling of specimen. Multiple sectioning prevents compression artifacts, separation of tissue, and other logistical problems with handling large thin sheets of frozen skin.

Some physicians believe that frozen section histology is the same as Mohs micrographic surgery, but it is not.<ref name=Maloney1999p116>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |page=116 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> Mohs surgery is performed using fresh tissue while frozen section histology may or may not be CCPDMA. Non-CCPDMA histology usually utilizes a random tissue sampling technique called "bread loafing". [[Bread loafing]] is a statistical sampling method which examines less than 5% of the total surgical margin (imagine pulling 5 slices of bread out of a whole loaf of sliced bread and examining only those 5 slices to visualize the whole loaf). In CCPDMA processing, the entire surgical margin is examined (imagine one who examined the entire outside crust of the same loaf of bread). In statistical terms, the more slices of bread one examines, the lower the "[[false negative]]" rate will become.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> False negatives occur when a pathologist reads cancer excision as "free of residual carcinoma", even though cancer might be present in the wound and missed because of the random sampling.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |page=118 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> In reality, most pathology labs examine only 3 to 8 sections of the "loaf" in their margin determination. The alternatives to Mohs surgery are CCPDMA based surgical excision and non-CCPDMA surgical excision. Dr. Mohs and CCPDMA pathologists have perfected methods of examining the entire surgical margin.

Mohs surgery often leaves an open wound, which most often is reconstructed (closed) by the Mohs surgeon. Members of the American College of Mohs Surgery perform the most reconstructive surgery for skin cancer wounds.

===Staining Convention===
Each surgeon has his or her own convention. A typical convention is as follows<ref>{{Cite book|first1=George R. |last1=Mikhail |first2=Frederic Edward |last2=Mohs |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7216-3415-9}}</ref>

==Differences between histology of transverse sections and vertical sections==
Sometimes, for confirmation purposes, a second opinion will be asked of a pathologist to review pathology slides from Mohs cases. Traditional histology of skin tissue uses vertical sectioning{{spaced ndash}}with the subcutaneous tissue at the bottom and the epidermis at the top. Mohs surgery uses tangential or horizontal sectioning, which can confuse the pathologists trained in the traditional method.

First, one has to determine the method of chromacoding or color-coding. The orientation of the Mohs map must be able to distinguish between medial, lateral, superior, and inferior.

Next, one has to determine if the surgeon followed the convention of mounting only 2 sections per case; as preferred by some authors;<ref name=Mikhail1991p307>{{Cite book|first1=George R. |last1=Mikhail |first2=Frederic Edward |last2=Mohs |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |page=307 |isbn=978-0-7216-3415-9}}</ref> or did he/she perform serial sectioning through the block as preferred by other authors.<ref name=Gross1999p62>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |page=62 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> If serial sectioning is performed, the distance between sections should be confirmed. Some surgeons utilize 100 micrometres between each section, and some utilize 200 micrometres between the first two sections, and 100 micrometres between subsequent sections (10 crank of tissue set at 6 to 10 micrometre is roughly equal to 100 micrometres if one allows for physical compression due to the blade).

Next, one determines if the entire epidermal border is present. Ideally 100% of the epithelial border should be present. Convention requires at least 95% of the epidermis to be present.<ref name=Gross1999p62/> However, some surgeons will make an exception for some missing epithelium at the apices of an elliptical excision around the specimen. Ideally, oval sections should be performed. However, for practical purposes on some lesions, a surgeon might cut the Mohs section to approximate the final closure defect. The apexes are often 1&nbsp;cm or more from the tumor, so clear margins at the apices can be ignored. This is not the ideal by convention, but is appropriate on a case by case basis.

Next, one determines if the surgical margin is clear. With serial sectioning, one has to recreate the surgical specimen in a 3 dimensional way. The first section that touches the blade begins the 3 dimensional reconstruction. By using the 3-D reconstruction of the specimen, one can say that all the epithelial margin is present as one progresses from deep to superficial. If only 2 sections are present, ideally, both the sections should be clear. If the deeper section is positive, one has to ascertain the distance between the sections. Convention often calls for a clear margin of at least 200 micrometres. For ambiguous structures that resemble both adnexal structure and carcinoma, following the serial sections will allow for one to identify the structure as benign or malignant. With the 2 slides method, this might be impossible to perform, as no 3-D reconstruction is possible with only 2 sections.

Carcinoma appearance under Mohs micrographic sectioning can be difficult. Tangential cut of squamous cell can mimic squamous cell carcinoma (but without the atypia). Sections through the buds of hair follicles can resemble isolated islands of basal cell cancers, often even with retraction artifact. Serial section analysis is best for Mohs surgery.

==Mohs Surgery and Blood Thinner==
The trend in skin surgery over the last 10 years has been to continue [[anticoagulant]]s while performing skin surgery. Most cutaneous bleeding can be controlled with electrocautery, especially bipolar forceps. The benefit gained by ease of [[hemostasis]] is weighed against the risk of stopping anticoagulants; and it is generally preferred to continue anticoagulants.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Alcalay J |title=Cutaneous surgery in patients receiving warfarin therapy |journal=Dermatologic Surgery |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=756–8 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11493301 |doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.01056.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1076-0512&date=2001&volume=27&issue=8&spage=756}}</ref>

==The Mohs Surgery Team==
The team consists of the Mohs surgeon, histotechnician, and assisting nurses. The Mohs surgeon identifies the cancer and its margin, often with the aid of [[dermatoscopy]]. He or she removes the cancer under local anesthetic and prepares it for histology processing. This is accomplished by cutting the specimen (if required), staining the specimen for orientation, and sending it to the lab.

The histotechnician prepares the tissue for Mohs processing by flattening the surgical margin on a flat surface first. Then the flat surgical surface is mounted on a cryostat to be sectioned and prepared for glass slides to be read by the pathologist.

In Mohs surgery, the surgeon acts as the pathologist.  He or she examines the slide for residual tumors, and marks the location of the tumor on the pathology report.

The Mohs surgeon most often functions as the reconstructive surgeon.  Members of the American College of Mohs Surgery perform more facial reconstruction for skin cancer defects than any other specialist.

==Why is the cure rate so varied?==
These are topics for discussion, but errors introduced in the technique can introduce false negative errors. There are numerous reasons why the cure rate is not 100%. Some of Dr. Mohs data revealed a cure rate as low as 96%, but these were often very large tumors, previously treated by other modalities. Some authors claim that their 5 year cure rate for primary basal cell cancer exceeded 99% while other noted more conservative cure rate of 97%. The quoted cure rate for Mohs surgery on previously treated basal cell cancer is about 94%.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=George R. |last1=Mikhail |first2=Frederic Edward |last2=Mohs |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |pages=6–7 |isbn=978-0-7216-3415-9}}</ref> Reasons for variations in the cure rate include,
#Modern frozen section method. Frozen section histology does not give the added margin of safety by the cytotoxic Mohs paste,<ref>http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/138/12/1593</ref> originally used by Dr. Mohs. This paste might have destroyed any residual cancer cells not detected by the pathologist.
#Missing epidermal margins. Ideally, the Mohs section should include 100% of the epidermal margin, but greater than 95% is often accepted.<ref name=Gross1999p62/> Unfortunately, vigorous scrubbing, poorly controlled initial curettage, poor tissue health, technician's error, and surgeon's error can introduce areas missing epithelial margin. Some surgeons consider 70% epithelial margin acceptable, while others suggest 100% margin. In the ideal situation, 100% of the epithelial margin should be available to be reviewed on serial sectioning of the Mohs specimen.
#Misreading of the pathology slide. It is difficult to differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeon limits their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue.<ref name=Mikhail1991p307/> This severely hampers their ability to determine if a structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections can not fully distinguish these two nearly identical structures,<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |pages=134, 453 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> and can lead to either "false negative" or "false positive" errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. Serial sectioning of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons.<ref name=Gross1999p62/><ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |page=272 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> Surgeons who performs serial sectioning through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured the contiguous nature of his tumor, the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and is familiarized with the nature of the tumor. Serial sectioning also makes it easier to work with three dimensional tumor with difficult to compress margins.
#Compression artifact, freezing artifact, cautery artifact, tissue folds, crush artifact from forceps, relaxing incision artifact, cartilage dropping out, fat compression, poor staining, dropping of tumor, etc.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |pages=149–62 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> These can be introduced as the tumor is "flattened". Stain can run from the surgical edge, and stain the surgical margin - giving a false impression that the entire surgical margin is clear, when it is not. While some surgeon unfamiliar with the "whole piece" or "PacMan"<ref name="Mosby"/> methods of processing might suggest that multiple piece sectioning is better than one. The more tissue sections are cut, the more artifacts in staining and tissue malformation will be introduced. It is imperative for the surgeon to be fully familiar with tissue handling and processing; and not simply relying on a trained technologist to perform his sectioning.
#Hard to see tumor in heavy inflammatory infiltrate.<ref name=Maloney1999p446>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |page=446 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref> This can occur with squamous cell carcinoma, especially when complicated with local infection, or intrinsic lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Because of abnormal peripheral blood profile, response to inflammatory skin conditions with patients with myelomonocytic leukemia can have appearance of atypical cells at sites of inflammation, confusing the Mohs surgeon.<ref name=Maloney1999p446/>
#[[Perineural spread]], and benign changes simulating perineural spread. Tumor spreading along a nerve can be difficult to visualize, and sometime benign plasma cells can surround the nerve, simulating cancer.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |pages=446–7 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref>
#Difficult to cut and process anatomical area.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Frederic Edward |last=Mohs |year=1956 |title=Chemosurgery in cancer, gangrene and infections: featuring a new method for the microscopically controlled excision of cancer |location=Springfield, Ill |publisher=Thomas |page=16 |oclc=488726321}}</ref> Examples would be the ear, and other three dimensional structures like eyelids. The ability to make a scallop shaped incision is increasingly difficult when the surgical surface is no longer a flat plane, but is a three dimensional rigid structure.
#Recurrent skin cancer with multiple islands of recurrence. This can occur with either previous excision, or after electrodesiccation and curettage. As these residual skin cancer are often bound in scar tissue, and present in multiple location in the scar of the previous surgical defect - they are no longer contiguous in nature. Some surgeons advocate the removal of the complete scar in the treatment of "recurrent" skin cancers. Others advocate removing only the island of local recurrence, and leaving the previous surgical scar behind. The decision is often made depending on the location of the tumor, and the goal of the patient and physician.
#Unreported or underreported recurrence. Many patients simply will not return to the original surgeon to report a recurrence. Consulting surgeon on the repeat surgery will often not inform the first surgeon of the recurrence. The time it takes for a recurrent tumor to be visible to the patient might be 5 or more years. Quoted "cure" rates must be looked upon with the understanding that a 5 year cure rate might not necessary be correct. As basal cell carcinoma is a very slowly progressing tumor, a 5 year no recurrence rate might not be adequate. Longer follow up might be needed to detect a slow growing tumor left in the surgical scar.
#Poor training of the surgeon/pathologist/histotechnologist. While Mohs surgery is essentially a technical method of tissue handling and processing, the skill and training of the surgeon can greatly affect the outcome. Success requires a foundation of good tissue handling, good surgical skill and hemostasis, and the bricks are the tissue processing and staining technique. A surgeon without a good histotechnologist is a house built with straw, and a histotechnologist without a good surgeon can not produce quality slides. While originally, surgeons learned the procedure by spending a few hours to several months with Dr. Mohs;<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> today, surgeons complete residency and fellowship spending hundreds of hours observing and doing Mohs surgery. It is highly encouraged that a physician interested in learning Mohs surgery should spend extended time observing, cutting, processing, and staining Mohs specimens. The histology block should be correctly mounted and cut the first time, as there is no second chances in Mohs histology. It is not a procedure that can be taught or learn in one weekend. Many residency and Mohs fellowship continue to teach the processing of only 2 Mohs sections per tumor.<ref name=Mikhail1991p307/>

Irrespective of the problems associated with Mohs surgery, a true cure rate approaching 100% can occur with primary basal cell carcinoma (previously untreated) if proper respect of the physician's limitation, the procedure's limitation, and his laboratory staff's limitation is paid. A conservative approach such as serial sectioning, good staining technique, and conservative Mohs margin (example: tumor at least 200 micrometre from the surgical margin) can assure the lowest recurrence rate.

Mohs surgery is not the answer for all skin cancers. Under select circumstances, radiation, topical chemotherapy, cryosurgery, electrodesiccation and curettage, and standard excision are better than Mohs surgery.  Studies comparing the effectiveness of Mohs surgery to other modalities often fail to specify surgical margin, method of processing ([[bread loafing]] with 3 or 4 sections, [[bread loafing]] with 0.1&nbsp;mm spacing, margin controlled, frozen section vs. standard histology); leaving little argument one way or another. Once a pathologist understands the simplistic nature of Mohs surgery, and its margin control ability{{spaced ndash}}little need is called for clinical trial comparing Mohs surgery to surgical excision.

In reality, Mohs micrographic surgery is nothing more than frozen section histology using a unique peripheral margin control tissue processing technique. There is nothing magical about its cure rate or why years of training is required. When compared to many other described peripheral margin control tissue processing technique{{spaced ndash}}the end result is the same{{spaced ndash}}allowing for the complete examination of 100% of the surgical margin. The method is unique only in that it is a simple way to handle soft, hard to cut tissue. Once learned, any pathologists currently doing frozen section histology would realize how simple the technique is. It is better than doing serial bread loafing at 0.1&nbsp;mm interval for improved false negative error rate simply in requiring less time, less tissue handling, and fewer glass slides mounted. Once mounted as tangential or horizontal sections, the pathologist simply has to relearn how to visualize skin structure on a tangential to horizontal view. In absent of a Mohs trained pathologist, peripheral sectioning followed by horizontal sectioning of the remaining center is equivalent to the Mohs method.<ref name=Maloney1999p113/><ref name=Maloney1999p116/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gross DA, Field LM |title=Cooperative frozen section surgery |journal=The Journal of Dermatologic Surgery and Oncology |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1085–8 |year=1987 |month=October |pmid=3655078}}</ref>

The clinical quotes for cure rate of Mohs surgery is from 97% to 99.8% after 5 years for newly diagnosed basal cell cancer, decreasing to 94% or less for recurrent basal cell cancer. Radiation oncologists quote cure rate from 90 to 95% for BCC's less than 1 or 2&nbsp;cm, and 85 to 90% for BCC's larger than 1 or 2&nbsp;cm. Surgical excision cure rate varies from 99% for wide margin (4 to 6&nbsp;mm) and small tumor, to as low as 70% for narrow margins applied to large tumors. Here the weakness of the procedure is the histopathological processing, and not the surgeon himself. The fault of the surgeon is lack of understanding pathology laboratory methods, and failing to follow the standard of care for adequate surgical margin. Usually the cure rate using standard bread loafing is very low for narrow surgical margin and a large tumor, and very high for large margins on small tumors.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Mary E. |last=Maloney |title=Surgical dermatopathology |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Malden, Mass |year=1999 |page=110 |isbn=978-0-86542-299-5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kimyai-Asadi A, Katz T, Goldberg LH, ''et al.'' |title=Margin involvement after the excision of melanoma in situ: the need for complete en face examination of the surgical margins |journal=Dermatologic Surgery |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1434–9; discussion 1439–41 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18076608 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.2007.33313.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kimyai-Asadi A, Goldberg LH, Jih MH |title=Accuracy of serial transverse cross-sections in detecting residual basal cell carcinoma at the surgical margins of an elliptical excision specimen |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=469–74 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16112355 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2005.02.049}}</ref> It is the pathology lab that makes the difference, especially when frozen section is utilized in the operating theater. A randomized study assigning patients with recurrent facial basal cell cancer to either Mohs surgery or standard excision revealed no statistical difference in the treatment of primary basal cell carcinoma.

Cosmetic appearance for Mohs surgery is very good, if combined with good reconstructive surgical skills. The majority of facial reconstruction due to skin cancer is performed by members of the American College of Mohs Surgery. Other specialists that sometimes reconstruct skin cancer defects include oculoplastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and plastic surgeons. In certain area, the tip of the nose, and the nasal ala, Mohs surgery can result in significant deformity, and might require multiple staged reconstruction to rebuild the nose cosmetically. 

In choosing a Mohs surgeon or reconstructive surgeon, it is mandatory that a patient request to see pictorial representation of his/her previous work. Then one can proceed to make a decision whether the Mohs surgeon should also be the reconstructive surgeon. 

==Controversy About Mohs Surgery==
Few individuals argue about the cure rate for Mohs, especially pathologists familiar with the procedure.<ref name=Maloney1999p116/> However, in recent years, a few authors suggested that Mohs surgery is no better than standard excision.<ref name=pmid15541449/> The author in one study did not conclude the adequacy of the study as it is limited in size and short duration of the study (30 months). Extensive studies performed by Dr. Mohs involving thousands of patients with both fixed tissue and fresh tissue cases have been reported in the literature.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mohs |first=Frederic Edward |title=Chemosurgery: microscopically controlled surgery for skin cancer |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1978 |pages= |isbn=978-0-398-03725-3}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Other surgeons repeated the studies with also thousands of cases, with nearly the same results.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=George R. |last1=Mikhail |first2=Frederic Edward |last2=Mohs |title=Mohs micrographic surgery |publisher=W.B.

Clinical 5 year cure rates with Mohs surgery:

#Cure rate of basal cell cancer of the ear, 1 to 2&nbsp;cm, 170 cases, 100%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} One needs to keep in mind that the cases performed by Dr. Mohs were for large and extensive tumors, often treated numerous times before by other surgeons. Regardless, his cure rate for small primary tumors either were 100% or near 100% when separated out from larger or recurrent tumors.

Experienced Mohs surgeons have reported cure rates for melanoma-in-situ from 95% to 98% (depending on if it is small MIS, or lentigo maligna variant), much higher than previously reported by Dr. Mikhail of 77%.<ref name=pmid18261099/>

These are only a small number of cases reported by Dr. Mohs, and numerous other articles by other authors have shown tremendous cure rates for primary basal cell carcinoma. However, with studies by Smeet, et al. showing a Mohs cure rate of about 95%, and another study in Sweden showing Mohs cure rate of about 94%;<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wennberg AM, Larkö O, Stenquist B |title=Five-year results of Mohs' micrographic surgery for aggressive facial basal cell carcinoma in Sweden |journal=Acta Dermato-venereologica |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=370–2 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10494714 |doi=10.1080/000155599750010292}}</ref> we really have to question if methodology practiced by Mohs surgeons around the world is of the same standard. Some surgeon also question if the standard 2 sections performed by some Mohs surgeons is adequate to control for false negative Mohs reports, as many surgeons prefer serial sectioning of multiple Mohs histology layers.

==Where Mohs surgery is allowed==
An example where clinical guidelines are issued by insurance companies; these guidelines are not indication that Mohs is the best method for the cancers described. These guidelines are subjective (why is younger than 40 years old a criterion?), and might not have any clear objective basis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Clinical guidelines currently adapted by Medicare insurance of the United States:<ref><nowiki>https://www.oxhp.com/secure/policy/derm_procedures_oma.html</nowiki>{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref>

==Future applications of Mohs surgery==
Mohs surgery can be applied to any relatively non-aggressive locally invasive tumor with a contiguous growth pattern (i.e. no skipped growth, or metastasis). Today, most Mohs procedures are performed by dermatologists. However, pathologists, plastic surgeons, and otolaryngologists<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth Gary |last1=Gross |first2=Howard K. |last2=Steinman |first3=Ronald P. |last3=Rapini |title=Mohs Surgery: Fundamentals and Techniques |publisher=Mosby |location=Saint Louis |year=1999 |pages=248–60 |isbn=978-0-323-00012-3}}</ref> have been trained and are utilizing Mohs surgery in their practice as well. Hopefully, as more physicians are trained in the method, Mohs surgery can be applied to other organs systems beside the skin. The limitation of this application to other tumors (i.e. prostate cancer, cervical cancer, laryngeal cancer) is that the tumor must be in the earliest stages and no metastasis has occurred. The second problem with Mohs surgery is the prolonged procedural time. However this is generally viewed as preferable to having a patient under general anesthesia which is more invasive for the patient and more costly to the healthcare system.

Currently, the American College of Mohs Surgery has limited training to physicians who have done a dermatology residency.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fellowship Training |publisher=American College of Mohs Surgery |url=http://www.mohscollege.org/acms/membership/fellowtrain.php}}</ref> It is the only formal training program that ensures the person performing Mohs surgery has spent 1-2 of dedicated study under a Mohs surgeon. The American Society for Mohs Surgery continues to encourage the training of physicians of all specialties to learn and apply the method invented by Dr. Frederick Mohs. The argument against physicians of other specialties than dermatology gaining Mohs training is that they are not adequately trained in dermatopathology. The argument for training other physicians beside dermatologists is that most Mohs surgeons do not make the initial diagnosis of the skin cancer{{spaced ndash}}thus misdiagnosis can be avoided. The pathology of Mohs sections are then limited to a few easily identifiable cancers; and the pathology of normal skin is simple enough to gain in a short preceptorship.

Dr. Mohs, a general surgeon, encouraged physicians of all surgical specialties to learn and apply his technique to the treatment of skin cancer; it is understood that he never intended to limit his method to be utilized by dermatologists alone. In countries where dermatology is not well developed, the Mohs procedure can easily be learned by any surgeon or pathologist after a short preceptorship{{spaced ndash}}the same way Dr. Mohs taught many current Mohs surgeons.
