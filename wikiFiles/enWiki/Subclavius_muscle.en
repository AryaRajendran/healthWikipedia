The '''subclavius''' is a small triangular muscle, placed between the [[clavicle]] and the [[first rib]].<ref name="Gray's-1918">{{cite book

Along with the [[pectoralis major]] and [[pectoralis minor muscle]]s, the subclavius muscle makes up the anterior wall of the [[axilla]].<ref>Drake, Richard, et al.  ''Gray's Anatomy For Students,'' Elsevier Inc., 2005</ref>

==Origin and insertion==
It arises by a short, thick tendon from the first rib and its cartilage at their junction, in front of the [[costoclavicular ligament]].<ref name="Gray's-1918" />

The fleshy fibers proceed obliquely superolaterally, to be inserted into the groove on the under surface of the clavicle between the [[trapezoid ligament]] and [[conoid ligament]]s, which collectively form the coracoclavicular ligament.<ref name="Gray's-1918" />

==Action==
The subclavius depresses the [[shoulder]], carrying it downward and forward. It draws the clavicle inferiorly as well as anteriorly.

The subclavius protects the underlying [[brachial plexus]] and subclavian vessels from a broken [[clavicle]] - the most frequently broken [[long bone]].

==Variations==
Insertion into [[coracoid process]] instead of clavicle or into both clavicle and coracoid process. Sternoscapular fasciculus to the upper border of scapula. [[Sternoclavicularis]] from [[manubrium]] to clavicle between [[pectoralis major]] and [[coracoclavicular fascia]].
