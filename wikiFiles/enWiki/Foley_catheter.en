A '''Foley [[catheter]]''' is a flexible tube that is often passed through the [[urethra]] and into the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. The tube has two separated channels, or [[lumen]]s, running down its length. One lumen is open at both ends, and allows [[urine]] to drain out into a collection bag. The other lumen has a valve on the outside end and connects to a [[balloon]] at the tip; the balloon is inflated with sterile [[water]] when it lies inside the bladder, in order to stop it from slipping out. Foley catheters are commonly made from [[silicone rubber]] or [[natural rubber]].

The name comes from the designer, [[Frederic Foley]], a surgeon working in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in the 1930s.<ref name=foley>{{cite journal | author = Foley, FE | title = A hemostatic bag catheter: one piece latex rubber structure for control of bleeding and constant drainage following prostatic resection | journal = J Urol | volume = 38 | pages = 134–9 | year = 1937}}</ref> His original design was adopted by [[C. R. Bard, Inc.]] of [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]], who manufactured the first prototypes and named them in honor of the surgeon.

The relative size of a Foley catheter is described using [[French catheter scale|French units]] (F).<ref>[http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_u_02zPzhtm#12837098 Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary]</ref> The most common sizes are 10 F to 28 F. 1 F is equivalent to 0.33&nbsp;mm = .013" = 1/77" of diameter.

Foley catheters come in several sub-types:
"Coudé" (French for elbowed) catheters have a 45° bend at the tip to allow easier passage through an enlarged [[prostate]].
"Council tip" catheters have a small hole at the tip which allows them to be passed over a wire.  
"Three way" or "triple lumen" catheters have a third channel, which is used to infuse sterile saline or another irrigating solution. These are used primarily after surgery on the bladder or [[prostate]], to wash away blood and blood clots.

A major problem with Foley catheters is that they have a tendency to contribute to [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTI).  This occurs because bacteria can travel up the catheters to the bladder where the urine can become infected.  To combat this, the industry is moving to antiseptic coated catheters.  This has been helpful, but it has not completely solved this major problem.  An additional problem is that Foley catheters tend to become coated over time with a [[biofilm]] that can obstruct the drainage.  This increases the amount of stagnant urine left in the bladder, which further contributes to the problem of [[urinary tract infection]]s.  When a Foley catheter becomes clogged, it must be flushed or replaced.

==When Foley catheters are used==

===In the urinary tract===
Foley catheters are used during the following situations:
*On patients who are [[anesthesia|anesthesized]] or [[sedation|sedated]] for surgery or other medical care
*On [[coma]]tose patients
*On some [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] patients
*On patients whose prostate is enlarged to the point that urine flow from the bladder is cut off.  The catheter is  kept in until the problem is resolved.
*On patients with acute urinary retention.
*On patients who are unable due to paralysis or physical injury to use either standard toilet facilities or urinals.
*Following urethral surgeries
*Following [[ureter]]ectomy
*On patients with kidney disease whose urine output must be constantly and accurately measured
*Before and after [[cesarean sections]]
===Cervical===
{{anchor|EASI}}
A Foley catheter can also be used to ripen the [[cervix]] during [[induction of labor]]. When used for this purpose, the procedure is called ''extra-amniotic saline infusion'' (EASI).<ref name=Guinn2004>{{cite pmid|15295370}}</ref> In this procedure, the balloon is inserted behind the cervical wall and inflated, such for example with 30 mL per hour.<ref name=Guinn2004/> The remaining length of the catheter is pulled slightly taut, and taped to the inside of the woman's leg. The inflated balloon applies pressure to the cervix, as the baby's head would prior to labour, causing it to dilate. As the cervix dilates over time, the catheter is readjusted to again be slightly taut, and re-taped to maintain pressure on the cervix. When the cervix has dilated sufficiently, the catheter simply drops out.<ref>[https://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Induction_P17_P25.html WHO article on induction of labour]</ref>{{dead link|date=July 2012}}

===Other===
They are also used in cases of severe [[epistaxis]], in order to block blood from freely flowing down the nasal passage into the mouth.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Risks==

There are several risks when using a Foley catheter (or catheters generally), including:
* The balloon can break while the catheter is being inserted. In this case, the healthcare provider will remove all the balloon fragments.
* The balloon might not inflate after it is in place. In some institutions, the healthcare provider will check the balloon inflation before inserting the catheter into the urethra. If the balloon still does not inflate after its placement into the bladder, it will be discarded and replaced with a new catheter.
* Urine stops flowing into the bag. The healthcare provider will check for correct positioning of the catheter and bag or for obstruction of urine flow within the catheter tube.
* Urine flow is blocked. The Foley catheter will be discarded and replaced with a new catheter.
* The urethra begins to bleed. The healthcare provider will monitor the bleeding.
* Introduction of an infection into the bladder. The risk of infection in the bladder or urinary tract increases with the number of days the catheter is in place.
* If the balloon is opened before the Foley catheter is completely inserted into the bladder, bleeding, damage and even rupture of the urethra can occur. In some individuals, long-term permanent scarring and strictures of the urethra could occur.<ref>{{cite web|author=December 18, 2012 |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/foley_catheter/page2_em.htm |title=Foley Catheter Causes, Symptoms, Treatment - Foley Catheter Risks on eMedicineHealth |publisher=Emedicinehealth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref>
* Defective catheters may be supplied, which break in situ. The most common fractures occur near the distal end or at the balloon.
* Catheters can be pulled out by patients while the balloon is still inflated, leading to major complications or even death. This may occur when patients are mentally impaired (e.g. they have Alzheimer's) or are in a mentally altered state (e.g. they are coming out of surgery).

==Alternative treatments==
* For obstructed prostates due to BPH: The Spanner [[Prostatic stent]]
* Intermittent self catheterization <ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003972.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>
