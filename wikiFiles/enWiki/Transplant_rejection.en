'''Transplant rejection''' occurs when [[Organ transplant|transplanted]] tissue is rejected by the recipient's immune system, which destroys the transplanted tissue.  Transplant rejection can be lessened by determining the molecular similitude between donor and recipient and by use of [[immunosuppressant drugs]] after transplant.<ref>Frohn C, Fricke L, Puchta JC, Kirchner H.

==Pretransplant rejection prevention==

{{Main|Histocompatibility}}

The first successful organ transplant, performed in 1954 by [[Joseph Murray]], involved identical twins, and so no rejection was observed.  Otherwise, the number of mismatched gene variants, namely [[alleles]], encoding cell surface molecules called [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC), classes I and II, correlate with the rapidity and severity of transplant rejection.  In humans MHC is also called [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA).

Though cytotoxic-crossmatch assay can predict rejection mediated by [[cellular immunity]], genetic-expression tests specific to the organ type to be transplanted, for instance [[AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing]], have a high negative predictive value.  Transplanting only [[blood groups|ABO]]-compatible grafts, matching blood groups between donor and recipient, helps prevent rejection mediated by [[humoral immunity]].

==Immunologic mechanisms of rejection==

Rejection is an [[adaptive immune response]] via [[cellular immunity]] (mediated by killer T cells inducing apoptosis of target cells) as well as [[humoral immunity]] (mediated by [[plasma cells|activated B cells]] secreting [[antibody]] molecules), though the action is joined by components of [[innate immune response]] ([[phagocytes]] and soluble immune proteins).  Different types of transplanted tissues tend to favor different balances of rejection mechanisms.

===Immunization===

An animal's exposure to the antigens of a different member of the same or similar species is ''allostimulation'', and the tissue is ''allogenic''.  Transplanted organs are often acquired from a [[cadaver]] (usually a host who had succumbed to trauma), whose tissues had already sustained [[ischemia]] or [[inflammation]].

[[Dendritic cells]] (DCs), which are the primary [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs), of the donor tissue migrate to the recipient's peripheral [[lymphoid tissue]] ([[lymphoid follicles]] and [[lymph nodes]]), and present the donor's ''self'' [[peptides]] to the recipient's [[lymphocytes]] (immune cells residing in lymphoid tissues).  Lymphocytes include two classes that enact [[adaptive immunity]], also called specific immunity.  Lymphocytes of specific immunity [[T cell]]s—including the subclasses [[helper T cell]]s and [[killer T cell]]s—and [[B cell]]s.

The recipient's helper T cells coordinate specific immunity directed at the donor's ''self'' peptides or at the donor's [[Major histocompatibility complex]] molecules, or at both.

===Immune memory===

When memory helper T cells' [[CD4]] receptors dock to [[MHC class II]] molecules, expressed on the surfaces of select cells, the memory helper T cells' [[T cell receptor]]s (TCRs) can recognize their target antigen being presented within the MHC class II.  The memory helper T cell produces clones that, as effector cells, secrete immune signaling molecules ([[cytokines]]) in approximately the cytokine balance that had prevailed at the memory helper T cell's priming to memorize the antigen.  As the priming event in this instance occurred amid inflammation, the immune memory is proinflammatory.

===Cellular immunity===

As a cell is indicated by the prefix ''cyto'', a cytotoxic influence destroys the cell.  Alloreactive [[killer T cells]], also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), have [[CD8]] receptors that dock to the transplanted tissue's MHC class I molecules,which display the donor's self peptides.  (In the living donor, such presentation of ''self'' antigens helped maintain ''self'' tolerance.)  Thereupon, the [[T cell receptor]]s (TCRs) of the killer T cells recognize their matching [[epitope]], and trigger the target cell's [[programmed cell death]] by [[apoptosis]].

===Humoral immunity===

Developed through an earlier ''primary exposure'' that primed specific immunity to the ''nonself'' antigen, a transplant recipient can have specific antibody crossreacting with the donor tissue upon the transplant event, a ''secondary exposure''.  This is typical after earlier mismatching among A/B/O [[blood types]] during blood transfusion.  At this secondary exposure, these crossreactive antibody molecules interact with aspects of [[innate immunity]]—soluble immune proteins called [[complement system|complement]] and innate immune cells called [[phagocytes]]—which inflames and destroys the transplanted tissue.

====Antibody====

Secreted by an activated B cell, then called [[plasma cell]], an antibody molecule is a soluble immunoglobulin (Ig) whose basic unit is shaped like the letter ''Y'': the two arms are the [[Fab regions]], while the single stalk is the [[Fc region]].  Each of the two tips of Fab region is the [[paratope]], which binds a matching molecular sequence and its 3D shape (conformation), altogether called [[epitope]], within the target antigen.

====Opsonization====

The IgG's Fc region also enables [[opsonization]] by a [[phagocyte]], a process by which the [[Fc receptor]] on the phagocyte—such as [[neutrophils]] in blood and [[macrophages]] in tissues—binds the antibody molecule's FC stalk, and the phagocyte exhibits enhanced uptake of the antigen, attached to the antibody molecule's Fab region.

====Complement cascade====

When the paratope of Ig class ''gamma'' (IgG) binds its matching epitope, IgG's Fc region conformationally shifts and can host a complement protein, initiating the [[complement cascade]] that terminates by punching a hole in a cell membrane.  With many holes so punched, fluid rushes into the cell and ruptures it.

Cell debris can be recognized as [[DAMPs|damage associated molecular patterns]] (DAMPs) by [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs), such as [[Toll-like receptors]] (TLRs), on membranes of [[phagocytes]], which thereupon secrete proinflammatory [[cytokine]]s, recruiting more phagocytes to traffic to the area by sensing the [[concentration gradient]] of the secreted cytokines ([[chemotaxis]]).

==Medical categories of rejection==

===Hyperacute rejection===

Initiated by preexisting [[humoral immunity]], ''hyperacute rejection'' manifests within minutes after transplant, and if tissue is left implanted brings [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]].  Of high risk in [[kidney]] transplants is rapid clumping, namely [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]], of [[red blood cells]] (RBCs or erythrocytes), as an antibody molecule binds multiple target cells at once.

===Acute rejection===

Developing with formation of [[cellular immunity]], ''acute rejection'' occurs to some degree in all transplants, except between identical twins, unless immunosuppression is achieved (usually through drugs).  Acute rejection begins as early as one week after transplant, the risk highest in the first three months, though it can occur months to years later.  Highly [[vascular]] tissues such as kidney or liver often host the earliest signs—particularly at [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] lining blood vessels—though it eventually occurs in roughly 10 to 30% of liver transplants, and 50 to 60% of kidney transplants. A single episode of acute rejection can be recognized and promptly treated, usually preventing organ failure, but recurrent episodes lead to ''chronic rejection''.

===Chronic rejection===
[[Image:Transplant_glomerulopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg| thumb| [[Micrograph]] showing a [[glomerulus]] with changes characteristic of a transplant glomerulopathy. [[Transplant glomerulopathy]] is considered a form of chronic antibody-mediated rejection. [[PAS stain]].]]
The term ''chronic rejection'' initially described long-term loss of function in transplanted organs via [[fibrosis]] of the transplanted tissue's blood vessels.  This is now ''chronic allograft vasculopathy'', however, leaving ''chronic rejection'' referring to rejection due to more patent aspects of immunity.

Chronic rejection explains long-term morbidity in most lung-transplant recipients,<ref>''Pediatr Transplant''. 2005 Feb;'''9'''(1):84-93</ref><ref>''Eur Respir J Suppl''. 2003 Nov;'''47''':57s-64s</ref> the median survival roughly 4.7 years, about half the span versus other major organ transplants.<ref>http://www.OPTN.org</ref>  In histopathology the condition is ''bronchiolitis obliterans'', which clinically presents as progressive airflow obstruction, often involving [[dyspnea]] and [[coughing]], and the patient eventually succumbs to [[pulmonary insufficiency]] or secondary acute infection.

Airflow obstruction not ascribable to other cause is labeled [[bronchiolitis obliterans]] [[syndrome]] (BOS), confirmed by a persistent drop—three or more weeks—in ''forced expiratory volume'' (FEV<sub>1</sub>) by at least 20%.<ref>''Am J Respir Crit Care Med''. 2007 Jun 1;'''175'''(11):1192-8</ref>  BOS is seen in over 50% of lung-transplant recipients by 5 years, and in over 80% by ten years.  First noted is infiltration by [[lymphocytes]], followed by [[epithelium|epithelial cell]] injury, then inflammatory lesions and recruitment of [[fibroblasts]] and [[myofibroblasts]], which proliferate and secrete proteins forming scar tissue.<ref>''Proc Am Thorac Soc''. 2006;'''3''':444-49</ref>  Generally thought unpredictable, BOS progression varies widely: lung function may suddenly fall but stabilize for years, or rapidly progress to death within a few months.  Risk factors include prior acute rejection episodes, [[gastroesophageal reflux]] disease, acute infections, particular age groups, HLA mis-matching, [[lymphocytic bronchiolitis]], and graft dysfunction (e.g., airway ischemia).<ref>''Proc Am Thorac Soc''. 2009;'''6'''(1):108-21</ref>

== Rejection due to non-adherence ==
One principal reason for transplant rejection is non-adherence to prescribed immunosuppressant regimens. This is particularly the case with case with adolescent recipients,<ref name="dobbels2012">Dobbels, F., Hames, A., Aujoulat, I., Heaton, N., & Samyn, M. (2012). Should we retransplant a patient who is non-adherent? A literature review and critical reflection. Pediatric Transplantation, 16(1), 4–11. doi:10.1111/j.1399-3046.2011.01633.x</ref> with non-adherence rates near in some instances.<ref name="dobbels2012" />

==Rejection detection==

Diagnosis of acute rejection relies on clinical data—patient signs and symptoms—but also calls on laboratory data such as tissue [[biopsy]].  The laboratory pathologist generally seeks three main [[histology|histological]] signs: (1) infiltrating [[T cells]], perhaps accompanied by infiltrating [[eosinophils]], [[plasma cells]], and [[neutrophils]], particularly in telltale ratios, (2) structural compromise of tissue anatomy, varying by tissue type transplanted, and (3) injury to blood vessels.  Tissue biopsy is restricted, however, by sampling limitations and risks/complications of the invasive procedure.  Cellular [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of immune cells [[radiolabeling|radiolabeled]] ''in vivo'' might offer noninvasive testing.<ref>Hitchens TK, Ye Q, Eytan DF, Janjic JM, Ahrens ET, Ho C, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.22702 "19F MRI detection of acute allograft rejection with ''in vivo'' perfluorocarbon labeling of immune cells"]. ''Magnetic Resonance Med''. 2011 Apr;'''65'''(4):114-53.</ref>

==Rejection treatment==

'''Hyperacute rejection''' manifests severely and within minutes, and so treatment is immediate: removal of the tissue.  '''Chronic rejection''' is generally considered irreversible and poorly amenable to treatment—only retransplant generally indicated if feasible—though inhaled [[cyclosporine]] is being investigated to delay or prevent chronic rejection of lung transplants.  '''Acute rejection''' is treated with one or multiple of a few strategies.

===Immunosuppressive therapy===

A short course of high-dose [[corticosteroids]] can be applied, and repeated.  ''Triple therapy'' adds a [[calcineurin inhibitor]] and an [[anti-proliferative agent]].  Where calcineurin inhibitors or steroids are contraindicated, [[mTOR|mTOR inhibitors]] are used.

'''Immunosuppressive drugs''':

* [[Corticosteroids]]
** [[Prednisolone]]
** [[Hydrocortisone]]
* [[Calcineurin]] inhibitors
** [[Ciclosporin]]
** [[Tacrolimus]]
* Anti-proliferatives
** [[Azathioprine]]
** [[Mycophenolic acid]]
* [[mTOR]] inhibitors
** [[Sirolimus]]
** [[Everolimus]]

===Antibody-based treatments===

Antibody specific to select immune components can be added to immunosuppressive therapy.  The [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal]] anti-T cell antibody [[OKT3]], once used to prevent rejection, and still occasionally used to treat severe acute rejection, has fallen into disfavor, as it commonly brings severe [[cytokine release syndrome]] and late [[post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder]].  (OKT3 is available in the [[United Kingdom]] for named-patient use only.)

'''Antibody drugs''':

* Monoclonal anti-IL-2Rα receptor antibodies
** [[Basiliximab]]
** [[Daclizumab]]
* Polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies
** [[Anti-thymocyte globulin]] (ATG)
** [[Anti-lymphocyte globulin]] (ALG)
*Monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies
**[[Rituximab]]

===Blood transfer===

Cases refractory to immunosuppressive or antibody therapy are sometimes given blood transfusions—removing antibody molecules specific to the transplanted tissue.

===Marrow transplant===

[[Bone marrow transplant]] can replace the transplant recipient's immune system with the donor's, and the recipient accepts the new organ without rejection.  The marrow's [[hematopoietic stem cells]]—the reservoir of [[stem cells]] replenishing exhausted blood cells including [[white blood cells]] forming the immune system—must be of the individual who donated the organ or of an [[identical twin]] or a [[cloning|clone]].  There is a risk of [[graft versus host disease]] (GVHD), however, whereby mature [[lymphocytes]] entering with marrow recognize the new host tissues as foreign and destroy them.
