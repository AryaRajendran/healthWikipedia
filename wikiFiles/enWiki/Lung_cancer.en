'''Lung cancer''' is a disease characterized by uncontrolled [[cell growth]] in [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[lung]]. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung in a process called [[metastasis]] into nearby tissue and, eventually, into other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in lung, known as primary lung cancers, are [[carcinomas]] that derive from [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells. The main types of lung cancer are '''small-cell lung carcinoma''' (SCLC), also called oat cell cancer, and '''non-small-cell lung carcinoma''' (NSCLC). The most common cause of lung cancer is long-term exposure to [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]],<ref name="Merck" /> which causes 80&ndash;90% of lung cancers.<ref name="Harrison" /> Nonsmokers account for 10&ndash;15% of lung cancer cases,<ref name="Thun" /> and these cases are often attributed to a combination of [[genetics|genetic factors]],<ref name="MurrayNadel46" /> [[radon]] gas,<ref name="MurrayNadel46" /> [[asbestos]],<ref name="O'Reilly" /> and [[air pollution]]<ref name="MurrayNadel46" /> including [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]].<ref name="AUTOREF" /><ref name="AUTOREF1" />

The most common [[symptom]]s are coughing (including [[Hemoptysis|coughing up blood]]), weight loss and shortness of breath.<ref name="Harrison" /> Lung cancer may be seen on [[chest radiograph]] and [[computed tomography]] (CT scan). The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is confirmed with a [[biopsy]].<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> This is usually performed by [[bronchoscopy]] or CT-guided biopsy. Treatment and [[prognosis]] depend on the [[histology|histological]] type of cancer, the [[staging (pathology)|stage]] (degree of spread), and the patient's general well-being, measured by [[performance status]]. Common treatments include [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]]. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<ref>{{cite book | last=Chapman | first=S | coauthors=Robinson G, Sradling J, West S | title=Oxford Handbook of Respiratory Medicine | edition=2nd | chapter=31 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | isbn=9-780199-545162 }}</ref>

Survival depends on stage, overall health, and other factors. Overall, 15% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer [[survival rate|survive]] five years after the diagnosis.<ref name="Collins" /> Worldwide, lung [[cancer]] is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women, and is responsible for [[:Category:Deaths from lung cancer|1.38 million deaths]] annually, as of 2008.<ref name="GLOBOCAN" />

Lung cancers are classified according to [[histopathology|histological type]].<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> This classification has important implications for clinical management and prognosis of the disease. The vast majority of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]]s—malignancies that arise from [[epithelial cell]]s. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a [[microscope]]. The two broad classes are non-small-cell and small-cell lung carcinoma.<ref name="Robbins" />

===Non-small-cell lung carcinoma===
[[Image:Squamous carcinoma lung 2 cytology.jpg|thumb|left|[[Micrograph]] of [[squamous carcinoma]], a type of non-small-cell carcinoma, [[FNA specimen]], [[Pap stain]]]]

The three main subtypes of NSCLC are [[adenocarcinoma]], [[squamous-cell lung carcinoma]], and [[large-cell lung carcinoma]].<ref name="Harrison" />

Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, which usually originates in peripheral lung tissue.<ref name="Holland-Frei78">{{cite book | last=Lu | first=C | coauthors=Onn A, Vaporciyan AA et al. | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition=8th | chapter=78: Cancer of the Lung | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House | year=2010 | isbn=9781607950141 }}</ref> Most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking; however, among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers"),<ref name="Harrison" /> adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer.<ref name="Subramanian">{{cite journal | last=Subramanian | first=J | coauthors=Govindan R | title=Lung cancer in never smokers: a review | journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume=25 | issue=5 | pages=561–570 | publisher=American Society of Clinical Oncology | month=February | year=2007 | pmid=17290066 | doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8015 }}</ref> A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]], is more common in female never-smokers, and may have different responses to treatment.<ref name="Raz"/>

Squamous-cell carcinoma accounts for about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated [[necrosis]] are commonly found at the center of the tumor.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess [[cytoplasm]], large [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and conspicuous [[nucleolus|nucleoli]].<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

===Small-cell lung carcinoma===
[[Image:Lung small cell carcinoma (1) by core needle biopsy.jpg|thumb|left|Small-cell lung carcinoma (microscopic view of a core needle biopsy)]]

In [[small-cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC), the cells contain dense neurosecretory granules ([[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing [[neuroendocrine]] [[hormone]]s), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association.<ref name="Rosti" /> Most cases arise in the larger airways (primary and secondary [[bronchus|bronchi]]).<ref name="Collins" /> These cancers grow quickly and spread early in the course of the disease. Sixty to seventy percent have metastatic disease at presentation. This type of lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking.<ref name="Harrison" />

===Others===
Four main histological subtypes are recognized, although some cancers may contain a combination of different subtypes.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book | last=Maitra | first=A | coauthors=Kumar V | year=2007 | title=Robbins Basic Pathology | edition=8th | publisher=Saunders Elsevier | pages=528–529 | isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 }}</ref> Rare subtypes include [[Salivary gland cancer|glandular tumors]], [[lung carcinoid|carcinoid tumors]], and undifferentiated carcinomas.<ref name="Harrison" />

===Metastasis===
The lung is a common place for [[metastasis]] of tumors from other parts of the body. Secondary cancers are classified by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.<ref name="Seo" />

Primary lung cancers themselves most commonly metastasize to the brain, bones, liver, and [[adrenal gland]]s.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> [[Immunostaining]] of a biopsy is often helpful to determine the original source.<ref name="pmid18784820">{{cite journal |author=Tan D, Zander DS |title=Immunohistochemistry for Assessment of Pulmonary and Pleural Neoplasms: A Review and Update |journal=Int J Clin Exp Pathol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |year=2008 |pmid=18784820 |pmc=2480532 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|List of cutaneous conditions associated with internal malignancy}}

[[Symptom]]s and signs that may suggest lung cancer include:<ref name="Harrison" />
<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;">
* [[coughing]]
* weight loss
* [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath)
* [[chest pain]]
* [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood)
* [[bone pain]]
* [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingernails
* [[fever]]
* [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]
* [[superior vena cava obstruction]]
* [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing)
* [[wheeze|wheezing]]

</div>
If the cancer grows in the [[airway]], it may obstruct airflow, causing [[dyspnea|breathing difficulties]]. The obstruction can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, and predispose to [[pneumonia]].<ref name="Harrison" />

Depending on the type of tumor, so-called [[Paraneoplastic syndrome|paraneoplastic phenomena]] may initially attract attention to the disease.<ref name="Honnorat" /> In lung cancer, these phenomena may include [[Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (muscle weakness due to [[autoimmune disorder|autoantibodies]]), [[hypercalcemia]], or [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH). Tumors in the top (apex) of the lung, known as [[Pancoast tumor]]s, may invade the local part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], leading to [[Horner's syndrome]], as well as damage to the [[brachial plexus]].<ref name="Harrison" />

Many of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> In many patients, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Common sites of [[metastasis]] include the brain, bone, [[adrenal gland]]s, contralateral (opposite) lung, liver, [[pericardium]], and [[kidney]]s.<ref name="ajcc" /> About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiograph.<ref name="Collins" />

==Causes==
Cancer develops following genetic damage to [[DNA]]. This genetic damage affects the normal functions of the cell, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.<ref name="Holland-Frei8">{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=KM | coauthors=Keats JJ, Sekulic A et al. | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House USA | year=2010 | chapter=8 | edition=8th | isbn=978-1607950141 }}</ref>

===Smoking===
[[Image:Cancer smoking lung cancer correlation from NIH.svg|thumb|right|[[NIH]] graph showing how a general increase in sales of tobacco products in the USA in the first four decades of the 20th century (cigarettes per person per year) led to a corresponding rapid increase in the incidence of lung cancer during the 1930s, '40s and '50s (lung cancer deaths per 100,000 male population per year)]]
[[File:cancerous lung.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a human lung: The white area in the upper lobe is cancer; the black areas are discoloration due to [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]].]]
[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]], particularly of [[cigarette]]s, is by far the main contributor to lung cancer.<ref name="AUTOREF5" /> Cigarette smoke contains over 60 known [[carcinogen]]s,<ref name="Hecht" /> including [[radioisotopes]] from the [[radon]] decay sequence, [[nitrosamine]], and [[benzopyrene]]. Additionally, nicotine appears to depress the immune response to malignant growths in exposed tissue.<ref name="AUTOREF6" /> Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women).<ref name="Peto" /> Smoking accounts for 80–90% of lung cancer cases.<ref name="Harrison" />

[[Passive smoking]]—the inhalation of smoke from another's smoking—is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker can be classified as someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US,<ref name="AUTOREF7">{{Cite journal | last=California Environmental Protection Agency | title=Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

===Radon gas===
[[Radon]] is a colorless and odorless [[gas]] generated by the breakdown of radioactive [[radium]], which in turn is the decay product of [[uranium]], found in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The radiation decay products [[ion]]ize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the USA, after smoking.<ref name="Alberg" /> The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 [[becquerel|Bq]]/[[cubic metre|m³]] increase in the radon concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmid K, Kuwert T, Drexler H |title=Radon in Indoor Spaces: An Underestimated Risk Factor for Lung Cancer in Environmental Medicine |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=107 |issue=11 |pages=181–6 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20386676 |pmc=2853156 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2010.0181 |url=}}</ref> Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. For example, in areas such as [[Cornwall]] in the UK (which has [[granite]] as substrata), radon gas is a major problem, and buildings have to be force-ventilated with fans to lower radon gas concentrations. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates one in 15 homes in the US has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 [[picocurie]]s per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).<ref name="EPA radon" />

===Asbestos===
[[Asbestos]] can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a [[synergy|synergistic]] effect on the formation of lung cancer.<ref name="O'Reilly" /> Asbestos can also cause cancer of the [[pleura]], called [[mesothelioma]] (which is different from lung cancer).<ref>{{Cite book | last=Davies | first=RJO | coauthors=Lee YCG | title=Oxford Textbook Medicine | publisher=OUP Oxford | year=2010 | chapter=18.19.3 | edition=5th | isbn=978-0199204854 }}</ref>

===Genetics===
Some people have a [[genetics|genetic]] predisposition to lung cancer. In relatives of people with lung cancer, the risk is increased 2.4 times. This may be due to [[genetic polymorphism]]s.<ref name="Fishman1802">{{Cite book | author=Kern JA, McLennan G | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=1802 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref>

===Other causes===
Numerous other substances, occupations, and environmental exposures have been linked to the genesis of cancer in lung tissue of humans. In its ''List of Classifications by Cancer Sites'',<ref name='WHOListLungCancer'>http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/Table4.pdf</ref> the International Agency for Research on Lung Cancer (IARC) states there is "sufficient evidence" to show the following are carcinogenic in lung:

<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;">
* Aluminum production
* Arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds
* Beryllium and beryllium compounds
* Bis-(chloromethyl) ether
* Methyl ether (technical grade)

</div>

==Pathogenesis==
{{main|Carcinogenesis}}

Similar to many other cancers, lung cancer is initiated by activation of [[oncogene]]s or inactivation of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s.<ref name="Fong" /> Oncogenes are believed to make people more susceptible to cancer. [[Proto-oncogene]]s are believed to turn into oncogenes when exposed to particular carcinogens.<ref name="Salgia" /> [[Mutation]]s in the ''[[Ras (protein)|K-ras]]'' proto-oncogene are responsible for 10–30% of lung adenocarcinomas.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" /><ref name="Aviel-Ronen" /> The [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, [[apoptosis]], [[angiogenesis]], and tumor invasion.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" /> Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung cancer and provide the basis for treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. [[Her2/neu]] is affected less frequently.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" /> [[Chromosome|Chromosomal]] damage can lead to [[loss of heterozygosity]]. This can cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Damage to chromosomes 3p, 5q, 13q, and 17p are particularly common in small-cell lung carcinoma. The ''[[p53]]'' tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p, is affected in 60-75% of cases.<ref name="Devereux" /> Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are ''[[c-MET]]'', ''[[NKX2-1]]'', ''[[LKB1]]'', ''[[PIK3CA]]'', and ''[[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]]''.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" />

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Thorax pa peripheres Bronchialcarcinom li OF markiert.jpg|thumb|Chest radiograph showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung]]

Performing a [[chest radiograph]] is one of the first investigative steps if a patient reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the [[mediastinum]] (suggestive of spread to [[lymph node]]s there), [[atelectasis]] (collapse), consolidation ([[pneumonia]]), or [[pleural effusion]].<ref name="Merck" /> [[X-ray computed tomography|CT imaging]] is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. [[Bronchoscopy]] or CT-guided [[biopsy]] is often used to sample the tumor for [[histopathology]].<ref name="Collins" />

[[Image:Thorax CT peripheres Brronchialcarcinom li OF.jpg|thumb|left|[[CT scan]] showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung]]

Lung cancer often appears as a [[solitary pulmonary nodule]] on a chest radiograph. However, the [[differential diagnosis]] is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including [[tuberculosis]], fungal infections, metastatic cancer, or [[organizing pneumonia]]. Less common causes of a solitary pulmonary nodule include [[hamartoma]]s, [[bronchogenic cyst]]s, [[adenoma]]s, [[arteriovenous malformation]], [[pulmonary sequestration]], [[rheumatoid nodule]]s, [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], or [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{Cite book | last=Miller |first=WT | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=486 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> Lung cancer can also be an [[incidentaloma|incidental finding]], as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan taken for an unrelated reason.<ref name="Fishman1815">{{Cite book | last=Kaiser | first=LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1815–1816 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on [[histopathology|histological]] examination of the suspicious tissue in the context of the clinical and radiological features.<ref name="Harrison" />

===Staging===
{{see also|Lung cancer staging}}

Lung [[cancer staging]] is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting the [[prognosis]] and potential treatment of lung cancer.<ref name="Harrison" />

The initial evaluation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging uses the [[TNM staging system|TNM classification]]. This based on the size of the primary <u>'''t'''</u>umor, lymph <u>'''n'''</u>ode involvement, and distant <u>'''m'''</u>etastasis. After this, using the TNM descriptors, a group is assigned, ranging from occult cancer, through stages 0, IA (one-A), IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IV (four). This stage group assists with the choice of treatment and estimate of prognosis.<ref name="Rami-Porta">{{Cite journal | last=Rami-Porta | first=R | coauthors=Crowley JJ, Goldstraw P | title=The revised TNM staging system for lung cancer | journal=Annals of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=4–9 | month=February | year=2009 | url=http://www.atcs.jp/pdf/2009_15_1/4.pdf | pmid=19262443 }}</ref>
Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has traditionally been classified as 'limited stage' (confined to one half of the chest and within the scope of a single tolerable [[radiotherapy]] field) or 'extensive stage' (more widespread disease).<ref name="Harrison" /> However, the TNM classification and grouping are useful in estimating prognosis.<ref name="Rami-Porta" />

For both NSCLC and SCLC, the two general types of staging evaluations are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It is based on the results of imaging studies (such as [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] and [[positron emission tomography|PET scans]]) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either intra- or postoperatively, and is based on the combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

==Prevention==
{{see also|Smoking ban}}

Prevention is the most cost-effective means of mitigating lung cancer development.

===Screening===
{{main|Lung cancer screening}}
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] refers to the use of [[medical test]]s to detect disease in asymptomatic people. Possible screening tests for lung cancer include [[sputum]] [[cytopathology|cytology]], [[chest radiograph]] (CXR), and [[computed tomography]] (CT). Screening programs using CXR or cytology have not demonstrated any benefit.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Manser | first=RL | coauthors=Irving LB, Stone C et al. | title=Screening for lung cancer | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue=1 | pages=CD001991 | year=2004 | pmid=14973979 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001991.pub2/full | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001991.pub2 }}</ref> Screening those at high risk (i.e. age 55 to 79 who have smoked more than 30 [[pack years]] or those who have had previous lung cancer) annually with low-dose CT scans may reduce the chance of death from lung cancer by an [[Absolute risk reduction|absolute amount]] of 0.3% ([[Relative risk reduction|relative amount]] of 20%).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Jaklitsch | first=MT | coauthors=Jacobson FL, Austin JH et al. | title=The American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines for lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography scans for lung cancer survivors and other high-risk groups | journal=Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | month=July | year=2012 | volume=144 | issue=1 | pages=33&ndash;38 | pmid=22710039 | doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.05.060}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Bach | first=PB | coauthors=Mirkin JN, Oliver TK et al. | title=Benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer: a systematic review | journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association | month=June | year=2012 | volume=307 | issue=22 | pages=2418–2429 | pmid=22610500 | doi=10.1001/jama.2012.5521}}</ref> The potential risks of screening however are not well known.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bach PB, Mirkin JN, Oliver TK, ''et al.'' |title=Benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=307 |issue=22 |pages=2418–29 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22610500 |doi=10.1001/jama.2012.5521 |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{main|Treatment of lung cancer}}
Treatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has [[cancer staging|spread]], and the patient's [[performance status]]. Common treatments include [[palliative care]],<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ferrell | first=B | coauthors=Koczywas M, Grannis F, Harrington A | title=Palliative care in lung cancer | journal=Surgical Clinics of North America | volume=91 | issue=2 | pages=403–417 | year=2011 | month=April | pmid=21419260 | doi=10.1016/j.suc.2010.12.003}}</ref> [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[radiation therapy]].<ref name="Harrison" />

===Surgery===
{{main|Lung cancer surgery}}

[[Image:Lung cancer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pneumonectomy]] specimen containing a [[squamous-cell carcinoma]], seen as a white area near the bronchi]]

If investigations confirm NSCLC, the [[cancer staging|stage]] must be reassessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or whether it has spread to the point where it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) are used.<ref name="Harrison" /> If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, [[mediastinoscopy]] may be used to sample the nodes and assist staging.<ref name="Fishman1853">{{Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1853–1854 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref>

[[Blood test]]s and [[pulmonary function testing]] are also necessary to assess whether the patient is well enough for surgery.<ref name="Collins" /> If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may be contraindicated.<ref name="Harrison" />

In most cases of early-stage NSCLC, removal of a lobe of lung ([[lobectomy]]) is the surgical treatment of choice. In patients who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision ([[wedge resection]]) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a higher risk of recurrent disease than lobectomy.<ref name="Fishman1855">{{Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1855–1856 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> Radioactive [[iodine]] [[brachytherapy]] at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Odell | first=DD | coauthors=Kent MS, Fernando HC | title=Sublobar resection with brachytherapy mesh for stage I non-small cell lung cancer | journal=Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume=22 | issue=1 | pages=32–37 | year=2010 | month=Spring | pmid=20813314 | doi=10.1053/j.semtcvs.2010.04.003}}</ref> Rarely, removal of a whole lung ([[pneumonectomy]]) is performed.<ref name="Fishman1855" />

[[Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery]] and [[VATS lobectomy]] use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Alam | first=N | coauthors=Flores RM | title=Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy: the evidence base | journal=Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons | volume=11 | issue=3 | pages=368–374 | year=2007 | month=July–September | pmid=17931521 | pmc=3015831}}</ref> VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, and with less postoperative illness.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Rueth | first=NM | coauthors=Andrade RS | title=Is VATS lobectomy better: perioperatively, biologically and oncologically? | journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery | volume=89 | issue=6 | pages=S2107–S2111 | year=2010 | month=June | pmid=20493991 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.03.020}}</ref>

In SCLC, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is typically used.<ref name='SimonTurrisi'>{{cite journal |author=Simon GR, Turrisi A |title=Management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=324S–339S |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17873178 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-1385 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/132/3_suppl/324S.long}}</ref> However the role of surgery in SCLC is being reconsidered.

===Radiotherapy===
[[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] is often given together with chemotherapy, and may be used with curative intent in patients with NSCLC who are not eligible for surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called '''radical radiotherapy'''.<ref name="OTO" /> A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Hatton | first=MQ | coauthors=Martin JE | title=Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) and non-conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a review and consideration of future directions | journal=Clinical Oncology (Royal College of Radiologists) | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=356–364 | month=June | year=2010 | pmid=20399629 | doi=10.1016/j.clon.2010.03.010}}</ref> Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC.<ref name="PORT Meta-analysis Trialists Group" /> Some patients with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Le Péchoux | first=C | title=Role of postoperative radiotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer: a reassessment based on new data | journal=Oncologist | volume=16 | issue=5 | pages=672–681 | year=2011 | pmid=21378080 | doi=10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0150 | pmc=3228187}}</ref>

For potentially curable SCLC cases, chest radiotherapy is often recommended in addition to chemotherapy.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

If cancer growth blocks a short section of bronchus, [[brachytherapy]] (localized radiotherapy) may be given directly inside the airway to open the passage.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Cardona | first=AF | coauthors=Reveiz L, Ospina EG et al. | title=Palliative endobronchial brachytherapy for non-small cell lung cancer | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue=2 | pages=CD004284 | month=April | year=2008 | pmid=18425900 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004284.pub2}}</ref> Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Ikushima | first=H | title=Radiation therapy: state of the art and the future | journal=Journal of Medical Investigation | volume=57 | issue=1–2 | pages=1–11 | month=February | year=2010 | url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmi/57/1,2/1/_pdf | pmid=20299738 }}</ref>

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is a type of radiotherapy to the brain, used to reduce the risk of [[metastasis]]. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Paumier | first=A | coauthors=Cuenca X, Le Péchoux C | title=Prophylactic cranial irradiation in lung cancer | journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume=37 | issue=4 | pages=261–265 | month=June | year=2011 | pmid=20934256 | doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.08.009}}</ref>

Recent improvements in targeting and imaging have led to the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered in a small number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical [[comorbidities]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Girard | first=N | coauthors=Mornex F | title=Stereotactic radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: From concept to clinical reality. 2011 update | journal=Cancer Radiothérapie | volume=15 | issue=6–7 | pages=522–526 | month=October | year=2011 | pmid=21889901 | doi=10.1016/j.canrad.2011.07.241}}</ref>

For both NSCLC and SCLC patients, smaller doses of radiation to the chest may be used for symptom control ([[palliative care|palliative]] radiotherapy).<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Fairchild | first=A | coauthors=Harris K, Barnes E et al. | title=Palliative thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer: a systematic review | journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume=26 | issue=24 | pages=4001–4011 | month=August | year=2008 | pmid=18711191 | url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/26/24/4001.full | doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.15.3312}}</ref>

===Chemotherapy===
The [[chemotherapy]] regimen depends on the tumor type.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

====Small-cell lung carcinoma====
Even if relatively early stage, SCLC is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hann CL, Rudin CM |title=Management of small-cell lung cancer: incremental changes but hope for the future |journal=Oncology (Williston Park)|date=2008-11-30|volume=22|issue=13|pages=1486–92 |pmid=19133604}}</ref> In SCLC, [[cisplatin]] and [[etoposide]] are most commonly used.<ref name="Murray"/> Combinations with [[carboplatin]], [[gemcitabine]], [[paclitaxel]], [[vinorelbine]], [[topotecan]], and [[irinotecan]] are also used.<ref name="Azim" /><ref name="MacCallum" />

====Non-small cell lung carcinoma====
In advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the patient is well enough for the treatment.<ref name="pmid18678835" /> Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either [[cisplatin]] or [[carboplatin]]). Other commonly used drugs are [[gemcitabine]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]],<ref name="Fishman1876">{{Cite book | author=Mehra R, Treat J | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=1876 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref><ref name="Clegg" /> [[pemetrexed]],<ref name="pmid20446853">{{cite journal |author=Fuld AD, Dragnev KH, Rigas JR |title=Pemetrexed in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=1387–402 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20446853 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2010.482560 }}</ref> [[etoposide]] or [[vinorelbine]].<ref name="Clegg" />

====Adjuvant chemotherapy====
[[Adjuvant chemotherapy]] refers to the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby [[lymph node]]s during surgery to assist [[lung cancer staging|staging]]. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years.<ref name="Carbone">{{Cite journal | last=Carbone | first=DP | coauthors=Felip E | title=Adjuvant therapy in non-small cell lung cancer: future treatment prospects and paradigms | journal=Clinical Lung Cancer | volume=12 | issue=5 | pages=261–271 | month=September | year=2011 | pmid=21831720 | doi=10.1016/j.cllc.2011.06.002 }}</ref><ref name="Le Chevalier">{{Cite journal | last=Le Chevalier | first=T | title=Adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer: where is it going? | journal=Annals of Oncology | volume=21 | issue=Suppl. 7 | pages=vii196–198 | month=October | year=2010 | pmid=20943614 | url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/suppl_7/vii196.long | doi=10.1093/annonc/mdq376}}</ref> The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens.<ref name="Le Chevalier" />

===Palliative care===
In patients with terminal disease, palliative care or hospice management may be appropriate.<ref name="Collins" /> These approaches allow additional discussion of treatment options and provide opportunities to arrive at well-considered decisions<ref name="pmid20818881">{{cite journal |author=Kelley AS, Meier DE |title=Palliative care&mdash;a shifting paradigm |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=363 |issue=8 |pages=781–2|year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20818881 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe1004139 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19856592">{{cite journal |author=Prince-Paul M |title=When hospice is the best option: an opportunity to redefine goals|journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.) |volume=23 |issue=4 Suppl Nurse Ed |pages=13–7 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19856592 }}</ref> and may avoid unhelpful but expensive care at the end of life.<ref name="pmid19856592"/>

Prognostic factors in NSCLC include presence or absence of pulmonary symptoms, [[tumor]] size, cell type ([[histology]]), degree of spread [[staging (pathology)|(stage)]] and [[metastases]] to multiple [[lymph nodes]], and [[vascular invasion]]. For patients with inoperable disease, prognosis is adversely affected by poor [[performance status]] and weight loss of more than 10%.<ref name="AUTOREF17">

Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer in terms of both [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] and mortality. In 2008, there were 1.61 million new cases, and 1.38 million deaths due to lung cancer. The highest rates are in Europe and North America.<ref name="GLOBOCAN">{{cite journal | last=Ferlay | first=J | coauthors=Shin HR, Bray F et al. |title=Estimates of worldwide burden of cancer in 2008: GLOBOCAN 2008 | journal=International Journal of Cancer | date=December 2010 | volume=127 | issue=12 | pages=2893–2917 | pmid=21351269 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.25516/full | doi=10.1002/ijc.25516}}</ref> The population segment most likely to develop lung cancer is people over 50 who have a history of smoking.

The role of [[passive smoking]] is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for lung cancer,<ref name="Taylor" /> leading to policy interventions to decrease undesired exposure of nonsmokers to others' tobacco smoke.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kemp | first=FB | title=Smoke free policies in Europe.

From the 1960s, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This is partly due to the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise.<ref name="Charloux" /> The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kadara | first=H | coauthors=Kabbout M, Wistuba II | title=Pulmonary adenocarcinoma: a renewed entity in 2011 | journal=Respirology | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=50–65 | month=January | year=2012 | pmid=22040022 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02095.x }}</ref>

==History==
Lung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761.<ref name="AUTOREF27" /> Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810.<ref name="AUTOREF28" /> Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s.<ref name="Witschi" /> Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912,<ref name="AUTOREF29" /> but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952.<ref name="Grannis" /> In [[Germany]] in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer,<ref name="Witschi" /> which led to an aggressive [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|antismoking campaign]].<ref name="Proctor" /> The [[British Doctors Study]], published in the 1950s, was the first solid [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking.<ref name="Doll" /> As a result, in 1964 the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] recommended smokers should stop smoking.<ref name="AUTOREF30" />

The connection with [[radon]] gas was first recognized among miners in the [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]] near [[Schneeberg, Saxony]]. [[Silver]] has been mined there since 1470, and these mines are rich in [[uranium]], with its accompanying [[radium]] and radon gas.<ref name="Greaves" /> Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Greenberg | first=M | coauthors=Selikoff IJ | title=Lung cancer in the Schneeberg mines: a reappraisal of the data reported by Harting and Hesse in 1879 | journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene | volume=37 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | month=February | year=1993 | pmid=8460878 }}</ref> Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the [[USSR]]'s demand for uranium.<ref name="Greaves" /> Radon was confirmed as a cause of lung cancer in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Samet | first=JM | title=Radiation and cancer risk: a continuing challenge for epidemiologists | journal=Environmental Health | volume=10 | issue=Suppl. 1 | pages=S4 | month=April | year=2011 | pmid=21489214 | doi=10.1186/1476-069X-10-S1-S4 | pmc=3073196}}</ref>

The first successful [[pneumonectomy]] for lung cancer was performed in 1933.<ref name="AUTOREF32" /> Palliative [[radiotherapy]] has been used since the 1940s.<ref name="Edwards" /> Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, was an attempt to use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery.<ref name="AUTOREF33" /> In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was seen as an improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy.<ref name="Saunders" />

With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection<ref name="AUTOREF34" /> and radical radiotherapy<ref name="AUTOREF35" /> were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.<ref name="AUTOREF36" />
