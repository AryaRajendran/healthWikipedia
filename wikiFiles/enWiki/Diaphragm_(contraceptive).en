The '''diaphragm''' is a [[cervix|cervical]] [[barrier contraception|barrier]] type of [[birth control]]. It is a soft [[latex]] or [[silicone]] dome with a spring molded into the rim.  The spring creates a seal against the walls of the vagina.

==Use==
Anyone inserting or removing a diaphragm should first wash their hands<ref name="pp">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jennifer|title=Diaphragms, Caps, and Shields|publisher= Planned Parenthood|date=December 2005|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control/diaphragms-caps-and-shields.htm|accessdate=2006-10-15 }}</ref> to avoid introducing harmful bacteria into the vaginal canal.

The rim of a diaphragm is squeezed into an oval or arc shape for insertion. A water-based lubricant (usually spermicide) may be applied to the rim of the diaphragm to aid insertion.  One [[teaspoon]] (5 [[Litre|mL]]) of [[spermicide]] may be placed in the dome of the diaphragm before insertion, or with an applicator after insertion.<!--

The diaphragm must be inserted sometime before [[sexual intercourse]], and remain in the vagina for 6 to 8 hours after a man's last ejaculation.<!--

Oil-based products should not be used with latex diaphragms. Lubricants or vaginal medications that contain oil will cause the latex to rapidly degrade and greatly increases the chances of the diaphragm breaking or tearing.<ref name="fwhc" />

Silicone diaphragms may last much longer—up to ten years.

==Fitting==
Diaphragms come in different sizes. A fitting appointment with a health care professional is necessary to determine which size a woman should wear.

A correctly fitting diaphragm will cover the [[cervix]] and rest snugly against the [[Pubis (bone)|pubic bone]]. A diaphragm that is too small might fit inside the vagina without covering the cervix, or might become dislodged from the cervix during intercourse or bowel movements.<ref name="afp" /> It is also more likely that a woman's partner will feel the anterior rim of a too-small diaphragm during intercourse. A diaphragm that is too large will place pressure on the [[urethra]], preventing the bladder from emptying completely and increasing the risk of [[urinary tract infection]].<ref name="afp" /> A too-large diaphragm may also rub a sore on the vaginal wall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diaphragms: Management of Side Effects|work=PocketGuide for Family Planning Service Providers: Barriers and Spermicides|publisher= Reproductive Health Online|year=2003|url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/English/6read/6multi/pg/barr7.htm#Vaginal%20lesion|accessdate=2007-09-15 }}</ref>

Diaphragms should be re-fitted after a weight change of 4.5&nbsp;kg (10&nbsp;lb) or more.<ref name="fwhc" /> The traditional clinical guideline is that a decrease in weight may cause a woman to need a larger size, although the strength of this relationship has been questioned.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kugel C, Verson H|title= Relationship between weight change and diaphragm size change|journal=Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN / NAACOG|volume=15|issue=2|pages= 123–9|year=1986|pmid=3517255|doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.1986.tb01377.x}}<br>

Diaphragms should also be re-fitted after any pregnancy of 14 weeks or longer.<ref name="pp" /> Full-term vaginal delivery especially will tend to increase the size diaphragm a woman needs, although the changes to the [[pelvic floor]] during pregnancy mean even women who experience second-trimester miscarriage, or deliver by [[Caesarean section|C-section]], should be refitted.

''Vaginal tenting'', an increase in the length of the vagina, occurs during arousal. This means that during intercourse, the diaphragm will not fit snugly against the pubic bone because it is carried higher up the vaginal canal by the movement of the cervix. If the diaphragm is inserted after arousal has begun, extra care must be taken to ensure the device is covering the cervix.<ref name="OrthoPI" />

A woman might be fitted with a different size diaphragm depending on where she is in her [[menstrual cycle]]. It is common for a woman to wear a larger diaphragm during menstruation. It has been speculated that a woman may be fitted with a larger size diaphragm when she is near [[ovulation]].<ref name="tcoyf">{{cite book|first= Toni|last=Weschler|year=2002|title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility|pages=232|edition=Revised|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-093764-5}}</ref> The correct size for a woman is the largest size that she can wear comfortably throughout her cycle.

In the United States, diaphragms are available by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] only. Many other countries do not require prescriptions.

==Mechanism of contraception==
The spring in the rim of the diaphragm forms a seal against the vaginal walls. The diaphragm covers the [[cervix]], and physically prevents sperm from entering the [[uterus]] through the [[external orifice of the uterus|os]].

Traditionally, the diaphragm has been used with spermicide, and it is widely believed the spermicide significantly increases the effectiveness of the diaphragm.  Insufficient studies have been conducted to determine effectiveness without spermicide.<ref name="vs spermicide">{{cite journal|author=Cook L, Nanda K, Grimes D| title=Diaphragm versus diaphragm with spermicides for contraception|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=|issue=2|pages=CD002031|year=2001|pmid=11406025|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD002031|editor1-last=Lopez|editor1-first=Laureen M}}</ref>

It is widely taught that additional spermicide must be placed in the vagina if intercourse occurs more than six hours after insertion.<ref name="pp" /><ref name="OrthoPI" />  However, there has been very little research on how long spermicide remains active within the diaphragm. One study found that spermicidal jelly and creme used in a diaphragm retained its full spermicidal activity for twelve hours after placement of the diaphragm.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Leitch W|title=Longevity of Ortho Creme and Gynol II in the contraceptive diaphragm|journal=Contraception|volume=34|issue=4|pages=381–93|year=1986|pmid=3780236|doi=10.1016/0010-7824(86)90090-9}}</ref>

It has long been recommended that the diaphragm be left in place for at least six or eight hours after intercourse. No studies have been done to determine the validity of this recommendation, however, and some medical professionals have suggested intervals of four hours<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kovacs G|title=Fitting a diaphragm| journal=Aust Fam Physician|volume=19|issue=5|pages=713, 716|year=1990|pmid=2346425}}</ref> or even two hours<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bernstein G|title=Is effectiveness of diaphragm compromised by postcoital swimming or bathing?|journal=JAMA|volume=237|issue=3|pages=270|year=1977|pmid=12259737|doi= 10.1001/jama.237.24.2643}}</ref> are sufficient to ensure efficacy. Interestingly, one manufacturer of contraceptive sponges only recommends leaving the sponge in place for two hours after intercourse.<ref name="CBAS">{{cite web|title=Sponges|work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society|year=2004|url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/sponges.cfm| accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> However, such use of the diaphragm (removal before 6 hours post-intercourse) has never been formally studied, and cannot be recommended.

It has been suggested that diaphragms be dispensed as a one-size-fits-all device, providing all women with the most common size (70mm). However, only 33% of women fitted for a diaphragm are prescribed a 70mm size, and correct sizing of the diaphragm is widely considered necessary.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mauck C, Lai J, Schwartz J, Weiner D|title=Diaphragms in clinical trials: is clinician fitting necessary?|journal=Contraception|volume=69|issue=4|pages=263–6|year=2004|pmid=15033398|doi= 10.1016/j.contraception.2003.11.006}}</ref>

==Effectiveness==
The effectiveness of diaphragms, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways: ''method effectiveness'' and ''actual effectiveness''.  The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant. Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.

For all forms of contraception, actual effectiveness is lower than method effectiveness, due to several factors:

* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the method's users
* conscious user non-compliance with method

For instance, someone using a diaphragm might be fitted incorrectly by a health care provider, or by mistake remove the diaphragm too soon after intercourse, or simply choose to have intercourse without placing the diaphragm.

''Contraceptive Technology'' reports that the method failure rate of the diaphragm with spermicide is 6% per year.<ref name="hatcher">{{cite book|first=RA|last= Hatcher|coauthors=Trussel J, Stewart F, et al.|year=2000|title=Contraceptive Technology|edition=18th|publisher=Ardent Media|location=New York|isbn=0-9664902-6-6|url= http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html }}</ref>

Unlike some other cervical barriers, the effectiveness of the diaphragm is the same for women who have given birth as for those who have not.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Trussell J, Strickler J, Vaughan B|title=Contraceptive efficacy of the diaphragm, the sponge and the cervical cap|journal=Fam Plann Perspect|volume=25|issue=3| pages=100–5, 135|year=1993|pmid=8354373|doi=10.2307/2136156|jstor=2136156}}</ref>

==Types==
Diaphragms are available in diameters of 50mm to 105mm (about 2-4&nbsp;inches). They are available in two different materials: [[latex]] (currently manufactured by Reflexions) and [[silicone]] (currently manufactured by [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical|Ortho]], Milex and Semina). Diaphragms are also available with different types of springs in the rim.<ref name="cbas diaphragm">{{cite web|title=Diaphragms|work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |year=2000 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/diaphragms.cfm |accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref>

[[Image:contraceptive diaphragm.jpg|thumb|left|An arcing spring diaphragm in its case, with quarter added to photograph for scale.]]

An ''arcing spring'' folds into an arc shape when the sides are compressed. This is the strongest type of rim available in a diaphragm, and may be used by women with any level of vaginal tone. Unlike other spring types, arcing springs may be used by women with mild [[cystocele]], [[rectocele]], or [[Retroverted uterus|retroversion]].<ref name="owh">{{cite web|title= Diaphragms |work=Ortho Women's Health |publisher=Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical |year=2001 |url=http://www.orthowomenshealth.com/products/diaphragmsprods.html|accessdate= 2006-10-18}}</ref> Arcing spring diaphragms may be easier to insert correctly than other spring types.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Women find arcing-spring diaphragm easier to insert, studies indicate|journal=Contracept Technol Update|volume=7|issue=4|pages=41–2|year=1986|pmid=12340681}}</ref> Examples of arcing spring diaphragms are the [http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/Images/allFlex_inHand.jpg Ortho All-Flex] and the [http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/downloads/Images/wide_seal_(case).JPG Milex Wide-Seal Arcing].

A ''coil spring'' flattens into an oval shape when the sides are compressed. This rim is not as strong as the arcing spring, and may only be used by women with average or firm vaginal tone.<ref name="afp" /> If an arcing spring diaphragm is uncomfortable for a woman or, during intercourse, her partner, a coil spring may prove more satisfactory. Unlike the arcing spring diaphragms, coil springs may be inserted with a device called an introducer. Examples of coil spring diaphragms are the [http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/downloads/Images/coil_spring_(hand).JPG Ortho Coil], the Milex Wide-Seal Omniflex, and the [http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/downloads/Images/semina.jpg Semina diaphragm].

A ''flat spring'' is much like a coil spring, but thinner. This type of rim may only be used by women with firm vaginal tone. Flat spring diaphragms may also be inserted with an introducer for women uncomfortable using their hands.<ref name="afp" /> Ortho used to manufacture a flat-spring diaphragm called the Ortho White.<ref name="fpn">{{cite web|title=Contraceptive Diaphragm|work=Family Practice Notebook|year=2000|url=http://www.fpnotebook.com/GYN14.htm|accessdate=2006-10-18|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060902071412/http://www.fpnotebook.com/GYN14.htm|archivedate=2006-09-02}}</ref> While some providers may still have Ortho White diaphragms in stock, the only current manufacturer of a flat-spring diaphragm is Reflexions.<ref name="cbas diaphragm" /><ref name="owh" />

Variations on the traditional diaphragm are being tested. The [[SILCS diaphragm]] is made of silicone, has an arcing spring, and a finger cup is molded on one end for easy removal. The [http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/images/buffergelcup2.jpg Duet] [[disposable]] diaphragm is made of dipped polyurethane, pre-filled with [[BufferGel]] (BufferGel is currently in clinical trials as a spermicide and [[Microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases|microbicide]]).<ref name="cbas diaphragm" /> Both the SILCS and Duet diaphragms are one-size-fits-all.

==Advantages==
The diaphragm does not interfere with a woman's natural cycle, therefore, no reversal or wait time is necessary, if contraception is no longer wanted or needed. 

The diaphragm only has to be used during intercourse. Many women, especially those who have sex less frequently, prefer [[barrier contraception]] such as the diaphragm over methods that require some action every day.<ref name="pp" />

Like all cervical barriers, diaphragms may be inserted several hours before use, allowing uninterrupted foreplay and intercourse. Most couples find that neither partner can feel the diaphragm during intercourse.

The contraceptive diaphragm may be used as a menstrual device, much like a [[menstrual cup]]. Contact with blood will discolor the diaphragm, but will not affect its contraceptive effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diaphragm|work=Dartmouth College Health Service|date=January 2004|url= http://www.dartmouth.edu/~health/depts/women/diaphragm.html|accessdate=2006-10-15}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2011}}

The diaphragm is less expensive than many other methods of contraception.<ref name="afp" />

===Protection from sexually transmitted infections===
There is some evidence that the cells in the cervix are particularly susceptible to certain [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs).  Cervical barriers such as diaphragms may offer some protection against these infections.<ref name="old method" /> However, research conducted to test whether the diaphragm offers protection from HIV found that women provided with both male condoms and a diaphragm experienced the same rate of HIV infection as women provided with male condoms alone.<ref name="new role">{{cite web|title=QUESTIONS & ANSWERS: The MIRA Diaphragm Trial Results|url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/documents/MIRA_QA-7-12.doc|format=DOC|publisher=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society|month=July|year=2007|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>

Because [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID) is caused by certain STIs, diaphragms may lower the risk of PID.<ref>{{cite journal|last=J|first=Kelaghan|coauthors= G.L. Rubin, H.W. Ory and P.M. Layde|date=July 1982|title=Barrier-method contraceptives and pelvic inflammatory disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=248|issue=2|pages=184–187|doi=10.1001/jama.248.2.184|pmid=7087109}}</ref> Cervical barriers may also protect against [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), the virus that causes [[cervical cancer]], although the protection appears to be due to the spermicide used with diaphragms and not the barrier itself.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Hildesheim A, Brinton L, Mallin K, Lehman H, Stolley P, Savitz D, Levine R|title=Barrier and spermicidal contraceptive methods and risk of invasive cervical cancer |journal=Epidemiology|volume=1|issue=4|pages=266–72|year=1990|pmid=2083303|doi=10.1097/00001648-199007000-00003}}</ref>

Diaphragms are also considered a good candidate as a delivery method for [[microbicide]]s (preparations that, used vaginally, protect against STIs) that are currently in development.<ref name="old method" />

==Risks==
Women (or their partners) who are allergic to [[latex]] should not use a latex diaphragm.

Diaphragms are associated with an increased risk of [[urinary tract infection]] (UTI)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fihn S, Latham R, Roberts P, Running K, Stamm W| title=Association between diaphragm use and urinary tract infection|journal=JAMA|volume=254|issue=2|pages=240–5|year=1985|pmid=3999367|doi= 10.1001/jama.254.2.240}}<br>{{cite journal|author=Heaton C, Smith M|title=The diaphragm|journal=Am Fam Physician|volume=39|issue=5|pages=231–6|year=1989|pmid=2718900}}</ref> Urinating before inserting the diaphragm, and also after intercourse, may reduce this risk.<ref name="pp" />

[[Toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS) occurs at a rate of 2.4 cases per 100,000 women using diaphragms, almost exclusively when the device is left in place longer than 24 hours.<ref name="afp" />

The increase in risk of UTI's may be due to the diaphragm applying pressure to the [[urethra]], especially if the diaphragm is too large, and causing irritation and preventing the bladder from emptying fully.  However, the spermicide [[nonoxynol-9]] is itself associated with increased risk of UTI, [[Candidiasis|yeast infection]], and [[bacterial vaginosis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Drug Information: Nonoxynol-9 cream, film, foam, gel, jelly, suppository|work=Medical University of South Carolina| date=March 2006|url=http://www.muschealth.com/cds/CPDrugInfo.details.aspx?cpnum=1477&language=english|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> For this reason, some advocate use of lactic acid or lemon juice based spermicides, which might have fewer side effects.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ursa|title=Natural Spermicides and Femprotect|work= Ovusoft.com Message Boards|date=June 2003|url=http://forums.ovusoft.com/tm.asp?m=1508226&p=1&tmode=6|accessdate=2006-10-17 }}<br>

==History==
The idea of blocking the cervix to prevent pregnancy is thousands of years old.  Various cultures have used cervix-shaped devices such as oiled paper cones or lemon halves, or have made sticky mixtures that include honey or cedar rosin to be applied to the cervical opening.<ref name="pp2">{{cite web|title=A History of Birth Control Methods|work=Planned Parenthood|date=June 2002|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/history_bc_methods.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> However, the diaphragm—which stays in place because of the spring in its rim, rather than hooking over the cervix or being sticky—is of much more recent origin.

An important precursor to the invention of the diaphragm was the rubber [[vulcanization]] process, patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1844. In the 1880s, a [[Germany|German]] gynecologist, C. Haase, published the first description of a rubber contraceptive device with a spring molded into the rim. Haase wrote under the pseudonym Wilhelm P. J. Mensinga, and the Mensinga diaphragm was the only brand available for many decades.<ref name="evolution">{{cite journal|year=2000|month= February|title=Evolution and Revolution: The Past, Present, and Future of Contraception|journal=Contraception Online (Baylor College of Medicine)|volume=10|issue=6|url= http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=93}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> In the United States, the physician Edward Bliss Foote designed and sold an early form of occlusive pessary under the name "[[womb veil]]" starting in the 1860s.<ref>Robert Jütte, ''Contraception: A History'' (Polity Press, 2008, originally published in German 2003), p. 154; Andrea Tone, ''Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America'' (MacMillan, 2001), p. 57 [http://books.google.com/books?id=ClHpjlw8zQEC&pg=PA57&dq=%22womb+veil%22+%22edward+bliss+foote%22+inauthor:tone&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22%20%22edward%20bliss%20foote%22%20inauthor%3Atone&f=false online];</ref>

American birth control activist [[Margaret Sanger]] fled to Europe in 1914 to escape prosecution under the [[Comstock laws]], which prohibited sending contraceptive devices, or information about contraception, through the mail. Sanger learned about the diaphragm in the [[Netherlands]] and introduced the product to the [[United States]] when she returned in 1916. Sanger and her second husband, Noah Slee, illegally imported large quantities of the devices from Germany and the Netherlands. In 1925, Slee provided funding to Sanger's friend Herbert Simonds, who used the funds to found the first diaphragm manufacturing company in the U.S., the Holland-Rantos Company.<ref name="pp2" /><ref name="note">{{cite web|title=Biographical Note|work=The Margaret Sanger Papers|publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College |location=Northampton, Mass |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html|accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref>

Diaphragms played a role in overturning the federal Comstock Act. In 1932, Sanger arranged for a Japanese manufacturer to mail a package of diaphragms to a New York physician who supported Sanger's activism. U.S. customs confiscated the package, and Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, in the court case ''[[United States v.

Although in Europe, the [[cervical cap]] was more popular than the diaphragm, the diaphragm became one of the most widely used contraceptives in the United States. In 1940, one-third of all U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception. The number of women using diaphragms dropped dramatically after the 1960s introduction of the [[Intrauterine device|IUD]] and the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]. In 1965, only 10% of U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception.<ref name="evolution" /> That number has continued to fall, and in 2002 only 0.2% of American women were using a diaphragm as their primary method of contraception.<!--
