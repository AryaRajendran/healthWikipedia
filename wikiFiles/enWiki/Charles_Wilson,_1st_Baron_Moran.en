'''Charles McMoran Wilson, 1st Baron Moran''', [[Military Cross|MC]] (10 November 1882 – 12 April 1977) is most famous for being [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill's]] personal physician. 
Born in Skipton, [[Yorkshire]], he served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] during the [[First World War]]. He won the [[Military Cross]] in 1916.

Moran's book, ''The Struggle for Survival'' is about Churchill during and after the war. It describes his failing health in detail. The book was published fifteen months after Churchill's  death and caused a great deal of controversy as a result of what was seen as a breach of patient-physician confidentiality.<ref name=wellcome>[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/20/4599.htm Wellcome Library]</ref>

He was the Dean of [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]] between 1920 and 1945, where he oversaw the rebuilding of the premises. He was a prominent scientist in his day, and was elected President of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in April 1941 and was re-elected each year until 1950, when he resigned in favour of [[Russell Brain]].<ref name=wellcome/>

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1942 and created [[Baron Moran]] in the New Year honours of 1943 and made his maiden speech in the [[House of Lords]], the same year, on the [[Beveridge Report]].<ref name=wellcome/> He was also involved in many other debates on the [[National Health Service]].<ref name=wellcome/>

Lord Moran had two sons, [[John Wilson, 2nd Baron Moran|John]] (the present Baron) and Geoffrey. He was survived by his wife Dorothy (née Dufton), who died in 1983.

During his time as Sir Winston Churchill's private doctor he met several prominent figures, such as [[Anthony Eden]], [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field-Marshal Montgomery]] (later the 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein) and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]]. Churchill's Private Secretary, Sir John (Jock) Colville, wrote: "Lord Moran was never present when history was made but he was invited to luncheon afterwards."
