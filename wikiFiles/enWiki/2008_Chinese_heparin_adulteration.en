In March 2008, major [[2008 Chinese export recalls|recalls]] of [[heparin]], a substance widely used as an injectable [[anticoagulant]], were announced by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) due to contamination of the raw heparin stock imported from [[China]].<ref>CBS News, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/01/eveningnews/main3896578.shtml Blood-thinning drug under suspicion]</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM112597 FDA informational page] with information and links about FDA investigation.</ref><ref name=time1>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Heparin's Deadly Side Effects |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1858870,00.html |quote=A month earlier and half a world away, a team of quality-control specialists from Baxter International, the big multinational health-care company (2007 sales: $11.26 billion) based in Deerfield, Ill., arrived in Zhejiang province, China, about two hours by car from [[Shanghai]], to inspect a facility owned by one of its key suppliers. CZ-SPL is a joint venture controlled by Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL), a Waunakee, Wis., company started in 1976 by Oscar Meyer, of hot-dog fame. (The connection: pigs naturally produce proteins used in pharmaceuticals.) CZ-SPL makes a key ingredient, what in the pharmaceutical business is called an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for a drug called heparin, a blood thinner that is widely used by kidney-dialysis and postsurgical patients to prevent [[blood clot]]s. The team found little unusual and gave the facility a clean bill of health. |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-16 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081121194220/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1858870,00.html| archivedate= 21 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==History==
The raw material for the recalled heparin batches was processed in China from pig's intestines by the American pharmaceutical firm [[Scientific Protein Laboratories]].<ref name=time1/><ref name=NYT20080306>{{cite news |first=Gardiner | last=Harris | authorlink=| coauthors=[[Walt Bogdanich]] |title=Drug Tied to China Had Contaminant, F.D.A.

Upon investigation of these adverse events by the FDA, academic institutions, and the involved pharmaceutical companies, the contaminant was identified as an "over-sulphated" derivative of [[chondroitin sulfate]], a closely related substance obtained from mammal or fish cartilage and often used as a treatment for [[arthritis]].<ref name=time1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/NewsEvents/Newsroom/MediaTranscripts/UCM169335.pdf|title=FDA Media Briefing on Heparin|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|first=Julie|last=Zawisza|date=2008-03-29|accessdate=2008-04-23|format=PDF}}</ref> Since over-sulphated chondroitin is not a naturally occurring molecule, costs a fraction of true heparin starting material, and mimics the in-vitro properties of heparin, the counterfeit was almost certainly intentional as opposed to an accidental lapse in manufacturing.<ref>{{cite news | first=Walt | last=Bogdanich | authorlink=Walt Bogdanich  | title=Heparin Find May Point to Chinese Counterfeiting| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/health/20heparin.html?hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1206032448-8vAmKaxtXzpFTH3rUaNgBg | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=March 20, 2008 | accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref>  The raw heparin batches were found to have been cut from 2-60% with the counterfeit substance, and motivation for the adulteration was attributed to a combination of cost effectiveness and a shortage of suitable pigs in China.  

When the FDA conducted an inspection of Baxter's Chinese Heparin supplier, it found serious deficiencies at the facility which the FDA detailed in a warning letter.<ref name="ChangzhouWARN">{{cite web|title=Warning Letter: Changzhou SPL Company, Ltd ( a/k/a "Kaipu") 21-Apr-08|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2008/ucm1048332.htm|work=FDA Warning letter|publisher=FDA|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Gardiner|last= Harris|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Chinese Factory Linked to Drug Under Inquiry in U.S. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/14/business/worldbusiness/14heparin.html |quote=Public health officials noticed a problem with heparin supplies late last year when children undergoing dialysis at a Missouri hospital had severe allergic reactions.

The FDA has stated that it does not have the funds nor bear the responsibility to inspect on a regular basis overseas manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as heparin.

In November 2008, the FDA seized eleven lots of heparin from Celsus Laboratories Inc., a manufacturer in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116977.htm FDA Seizes Contaminated Heparin from a Cincinnati Manufacturer] (FDA press release, Nov. 6, 2008)</ref>
