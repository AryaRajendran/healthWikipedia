[[Image:Gustave Moreau 003.jpg|thumb|''[[Heracles]] and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]'' by [[Gustave Moreau]]: The Hydra is perhaps the best known mythological multi-headed animal, also popularised in many [[fantasy]] settings.]]

'''Polycephaly''' is a condition of having [[supernumerary body part|more than one]] head. The term is derived from the Greek [[word stem|stems]] ''poly-'' (Greek: "πολύ") meaning 'much' and ''kephali-'' (Greek: "κεφάλι") meaning "head", and encompasses '''bicephaly''' and '''dicephaly''' (both referring to '''two-headedness''').  A variation is an animal born with two faces on a single head, a condition known as [[diprosopus]].  In medical terms these are all [[congenital disorder|congenital]] [[cephalic disorder]]s.

There are many occurrences of '''multi-headed animals''', in real life as well as in [[mythology]].  In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], the [[double-headed eagle]] is a common symbol, though no such animal is known to have ever existed.

Bicephalic or tricephalic animals are the only type of multi-headed creatures seen in the real world and form by the same process as [[conjoined twins]]: they all result from the failed separation of [[monozygotic]] twins.  One extreme example of this is the condition of [[craniopagus parasiticus]], whereby a fully developed body has a [[parasitic twin]] head joined at the [[skull]].

== Occurrences ==

Two-headed people and animals, though rare, have long been known to exist and documented.  The "[[Scottish brothers]]" were [[conjoined twins]], allegedly dicephalic, born 1460 (dates vary).  (Human conjoined twins, not all of the dicephalic type, have been documented since 945.)

=== Novelty and study ===

Polycephalic animals often make local news headlines when found.  The most commonly observed two-headed animals are [[turtle]]s and [[snake]]s.<ref name="pravda">{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/11400_anomaly.html|title=Two-Headed Creatures|publisher=Pravda.ru|first=Svetlana|last=Anina|date=2003-11-29|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  Other species with known two-headed occurrences include cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, and [[fish]].  In 1894, a two-headed [[partridge]] was reported in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/279028602.html?dids=279028602:279028602&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=MAY+06%2C+1894&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=A+TWO-HEADED+PARTRIDGE. |title=A two-headed partridge| publisher=The Washington Post|date=1894-05-06|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> It was notable as a dicephalic animal for surviving into adulthood with two perfect heads.  Scientists have published in modern journals about dissecting such animals since at least the 1930s.<ref name="pravda" />  A 1929 paper studied the anatomy of a two-headed kitten.<ref name="pravda" />

Polycephalic animals, due to their rarity, are a subject of novelty.  "We", a two-headed albino rat snake born in captivity in 2000 with both female and male genitalia, was scheduled to be auctioned on [[eBay]] with an expected price tag of $150,000 (£87,000), though their policy of not trading in live animals prevented the sale.<ref name="bbcsnake1">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4577258.stm| title=Two-headed snake 'up for auction'| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2006-03-10 | date=2006-01-03}}</ref><ref name="wemsnbc">{{cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19334041| title='We' the 2-headed snake's long odd life ends| publisher=MSNBC| accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> On 31 October 2006, the World Aquarium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldaquarium.org|title=World Aquarium|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> announced that "We" was adopted by Nutra Pharma Corporation, a biotechnology company developing treatments using modified cobra venom and cobratoxin.<ref name="nutrapharma-we1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nutrapharma.com/display.php?newsid=91|title=Nutra Pharma Adopts Famous 2-Headed Snake of St. Louis’ World Aquarium}}</ref> We died of [[natural causes]] at age eight in June 2007, not long after being acquired by Nutra Pharma.<ref name="wemsnbc"/>

Two-headed farm animals sometimes travel with [[freak show|animal side shows]] to county fairs. Most notably, The Venice Beach Freakshow supposedly houses the largest collection of two-headed specimens in the world, including over 20 two-headed animals that are alive. Many museums of natural history contain preserved two-headed animals. The Museum of Lausanne<ref name="lausanne">{{cite web|url=http://www-sst.unil.ch/Musee/default_e.htm|title=Le Musée cantonal de Géologie(The Museum of Lausanne)|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, and the [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]] museum in [[Gatlinburg]], [[Tennessee]], have collections of preserved two-headed animals. A very well preserved 2-headed lamb is on display in [[Llanidloes]] museum in Wales. A live two-headed turtle named Janus can be seen at the Natural History Museum in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref name="janus">{{cite web| url=http://www.euphoria-magazine.com/nature/37-nature/129-turtle-janus| title=Janus, live two-headed turtle|work=Euphoia Magazine|accessdate=2011-05-13|date=23 April 2008}}</ref><ref name="janus-NHMG">{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/plan_galeries.php|title=Plan des galeries publiques|language=French|trans_title=Plan of the public galleries|accessdate=2011-05-13}}</ref>

=== Anatomy and fitness ===

Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own [[brain]], and they somehow share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies.  Animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains "arguing" with each other; some animals simply [[zig-zag]] without getting anywhere<ref name="annexedturtle" />  Snake heads may attack and even attempt to swallow each other.  Thus, polycephalic animals survive poorly in the wild compared to normal monocephalic animals.

Most two-headed snakes only live for a few months, though some have been reported to live a full life and even reproduced with the offspring born normal.   A two-headed black [[rat snake]] with separate throats and stomachs survived for 20 years.  A two-headed albino rat snake named "We" survived in captivity for 8 years.<ref>{{cite web| url="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19334041/"| title='We' the 2-headed snake's long life ends}}</ref>  There is some speculation that the [[inbreeding]] of snakes in captivity increases the chances of a two-headed birth.<ref name="mayell2002">{{cite web| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/03/0318_0319_twoheadsnake.html| title=Life Is Confusing For Two-Headed Snakes| first=Hillary| last=Mayell| publisher=National Geographic News| month=March 22| year=2002| accessdate=2006-03-10}}</ref>

A famous successful modern case is that of the human dicephalic twins [[Abigail and Brittany Hensel]], born in 1990.  The twins have two separate heads and faces, they each have their own individual brains, spinal cords, and hearts. Abby and Brittany however have four lungs, two stomachs, two gall bladders, and three kidneys (2 left, 1 right).  Each twin controls the limbs and body parts on her "side", and with coordination that allows them to walk, run, play piano, swim, drive and do anything else they wish.<ref name="hensel" />

=== One or two animals? ===

It is difficult to draw the line between what is considered "one animal with two heads" or "two animals that share a body".

With humans, dicephalic [[conjoined twins]] such as [[Abigail and Brittany Hensel]] are considered "twins", i.e., two individuals.<ref name="time-hensel1">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,984307,00.html|title=The most intimate bond: Conjoined for life, the Hensel twins are a medical mystery and a lesson in cooperation for us all|first=Claudia|last=Wallis|publisher=Time magazine|date=1996-03-25|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> This makes sense as there is a range of conjoinedness, and non-dicephalic conjoined twins may be barely conjoined and separable by surgery, as was the case with [[Chang and Eng Bunker]]. Although the Hensel twins only have one pair of arms and legs total, each twin controls one side of the body's limbs.  On the other hand, [[Syafitri]], born 2006 in [[Indonesia]], were given one name by their parents because they only had one heart.<ref name="jakarta-syafitri" />

With other animals, polycephaly is usually described as "one animal with two heads".<ref name="bbcsnake1" /><ref name="natgeotortoise1" /> One of the heads, especially in three-headed animals, may be poorly developed and malformed, and not "participate" much.<ref name="annexedturtle" />

== Earliest known occurrence ==

The February 22, 2007 issue of the journal [[Biology Letters]] detailed the discovery of a 120 million-year-old fossil of a 2-headed ''[[Hyphalosaurus lingyuanensis]]'', marking the earliest known occurrence of axial bifurcation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/1234-ancient-reptile-heads.html|title=Ancient Reptile Has Two Heads}}</ref>

==== Cattle ====

[[Image:Monstre-img 0573.jpg|thumb|Two-headed calf, Lausanne]]

* A full body taxidermy of a two-headed calf is on display at the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah. "The Dancing Calves" were born by natural delivery with considerable assistance from S. T. Nelson of Cedar City, Utah on Mother's Day, May 8, 1949, to a crossbred cow owned by Willard Lund of [[Paragonah, Utah]]. The "Father Bull" is unknown but must have been an outstanding Hereford. The double calf was alive and healthy but died during birth. This calf, or calves, joined together from the beginning of the neck thru the belly, with two complete, almost perfect body frames, had but one system of vital organs. Each of the two normal heads had a food channel to one stomach and a breathing channel, or windpipe, to the one set of lungs. The two briskets, or breasts, shared on each side by these calves, contained the one set of lungs on one side and the one heart on the other side. Branching off from the one stomach and digestive system were two channels of elimination. This calf weighed approximately 85 pounds at birth. The over-all measurements as it stands mounted are: 42.5&nbsp;inches high, 20&nbsp;inches from tail to tail, and 18&nbsp;inches from side to side including the front legs. The "Mother Cow" lived and was sold as a "fat cow" in July, 1949. This calf was stuffed by Mr. C. J. Sanders, taxidermist, 2631 South State Street, Salt Lake City 5, Utah, who stated that it is the most unusual monstrosity he has ever worked with. Dr. A. C. Johnson, of Cedar City, Utah, stated that this is the best specimen of monstrosity in animal life that he has ever seen or heard of in his 47 years of practice as a veterinarian. "The Dancing Calves" were owned by West and Gail Seegmiller who displayed them for many years at their Desert Pearl Cafe (no longer in existence), in Cedar City, Utah. Dr. A. C. Johnson, Dr. T. Donald Bell, William H. Lund, Dr. R. G. Williams, Dr. J. S. Prestwich, Dr. A. L. Graff, S. T. Nelson, and James Hoyle, Jr. all signed as witnesses that they saw the calf in the flesh soon after birth and knew it to be authentic. The calves and original document were donated to the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah, where they are now on display.
