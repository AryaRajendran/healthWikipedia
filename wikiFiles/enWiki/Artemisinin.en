'''Artemisinin''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɑr|t|ɨ|ˈ|m|ɪ|s|ɨ|n|ɨ|n}}), also known as '''''Qinghaosu''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[:zh:青蒿素|青蒿素]]), and its derivatives are a group of  [[medication|drugs]] that possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against  ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Assessment of the pharmacodynamic properties of antimalarial drugs in vivo |journal=Antimicrob.

The starting compound artemisinin is isolated from the plant ''[[Artemisia annua]]'', sweet wormwood, a herb employed in [[Chinese traditional medicine]].

Chemically, artemisinin is a [[sesquiterpene lactone]] containing an unusual [[peroxide]] bridge. This peroxide is believed to be responsible for the drug's mechanism of action. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known.<ref name=eic>{{cite journal|title=Artemisinin and a new generation of antimalarial drugs|author=|journal=Education in Chemistry|date=July 2006|pages=|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/EiC/issues/2006July/Artemisinin.asp}}</ref> ([[Ascaridole]] is another.)

Use of the drug by itself as a [[monotherapy]] is explicitly discouraged by the [[World Health Organization]], as there have been signs that malarial parasites are developing resistance to the drug.  Therapies that combine artemisinin with some other antimalarial drug are the preferred treatment for malaria and are both effective and well tolerated in patients.

== History ==
''Artemisia annua'' has been used by Chinese [[herbalist]]s for more than two thousand years in the treatment of many illnesses, such as skin diseases and malaria. The earliest record dates back to 200 BC, in the "[[Wushi'er bingfang|Fifty-two Prescriptions]]" unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] Han Dynasty tombs. Its [[Antimalarial drug|antimalarial]] application was first described, in ''Zhouhou Beiji Fang'' ("The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies", {{zh|c=肘后备急方}}), edited in the middle of the fourth century by [[Ge Hong]]. In that book, 43 malaria treatment methods were recorded.

''A. annua'' is a common herb and has been found in many parts of the world, including along the [[Potomac River]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] Images of the original scientific papers are available online<ref>[http://qinghaosu.blogspot.com/ Qinghaosu Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a book by Zhang Jianfang, ''Late Report: Record of Project 523 and the Research and Development of Qinghaosu'' (Yangcheng Evening News Publisher 2007(張劍方. 遲到的報告五二三項目與青蒿素研發紀實. 羊城晚報出版社, 2007)),<ref>[http://www.ycwb.com/ycwb/2007-01/05/content_1339932.htm ycwb.com]</ref> was published in 2006, which records the history of the discovery.

[[File:Artemisia annua.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Artemisia annua'']]
In the 1960s, a research program, under the name ''Project 523'', was set up by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese army]] to find an adequate treatment for malaria. The [[Drug discovery|plant screening program]] and early clinical work with botanical preparations were based on the orders of Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], at the request from North Vietnamese leaders to provide medical assistance for their malaria-ridden army. In 1972, in the course of this research, [[Tu Youyou]]<ref>[http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Tu_Youyou ChinaVitae: Tu Youyou]</ref> discovered artemisinin in the leaves of ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' (annual wormwood).<ref name="Miller2011">{{cite journal|title=Artemisinin: discovery from the Chinese herbal garden|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411009500|journal=Cell|date=September 16, 2011|volume=146|issue=6|pages=855–858|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.024|pmid=21907397|author=Miller L.H. and Su X.|publisher=Cell Press|location=CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139, USA|issn=0092-8674}}</ref> The drug is named ''Qinghaosu'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:青|青]][[wiktionary:蒿|蒿]][[wiktionary:素|素]]}}) in Chinese. It was one of many candidates then tested by Chinese scientists from a list of nearly 5000 traditional [[Chinese medicine]]s for treating [[malaria]]. It was not only the most effective, but it was found to clear malaria parasites from patients' bodies faster than any other drug. ''Project 523'' developed, in addition to artemisinin, a number of products that are used in combination with artemisinin, including [[lumefantrine]], [[piperaquine]], and [[pyronaridine]].<ref name="Miller2011"/>

For many years after the discovery, access to the purified drug and the plant from which it was extracted were restricted by the Chinese government. It was not until the [[Chinese economic reform]] in the late 1970's and early 80's that news of the discovery reached scientists outside China when results were published in the ''Chinese Medical Journal'' in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Antimalaria studies on Qinghaosu |journal=Chin.

The research was met with skepticism at first, partly because the chemical structure of artemisinin, particularly the [[peroxide]], appeared to be too unstable to be a viable drug.<ref name=eic/> 

In the late 90's, [[Novartis]] bought a new Chinese patent for a combination treatment with [[artemether]] and [[lumefantrine]], providing the first artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) (Coartem) at reduced prices to the [[World Health Organisation]].<ref>D. MNeil (2012). [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/health/for-intrigue-malaria-drug-artemisinin-gets-the-prize.html?pagewanted=all "For Intrigue, Malaria Drug Gets the Prize".] NYTimes, Health. Retrieved 20. April 2013.</ref>

In 2006, after artemisinin had become the treatment of choice for malaria, the WHO called for an immediate halt to single-drug artemisinin preparations in favor of combinations of artemisinin with another malaria drug, to reduce the risk of parasites developing resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr02/en/|title=WHO calls for an immediate halt to provision of single-drug artemisinin malaria pills|date=19 January 2006|publisher=WHO}}</ref>

== Artemisinin derivatives ==
Because artemisinin itself has physical properties such as poor [[bioavailability]] that limit its effectiveness, semisynthetic [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s of artemisinin have been developed. These include:

*[[Artesunate]] (water-soluble: for oral, rectal, intramuscular, or intravenous use)
*[[Artemether]] (lipid-soluble: for oral, rectal or intramuscular use)
*[[Dihydroartemisinin]]
*[[Artelinic acid]]
*[[Artenimol]]
*[[Artemotil]]

There are also simplified analogs in preclinical research.<ref>{{cite journal | author= [[Gary H. Posner]]; Michael H.

==Indications==

===Uncomplicated malaria===
Artemisinins can be used alone, but this leads to a high rate of [[recrudescence]] (return of parasites) and other drugs are required to clear the body of all parasites and prevent recurrence. The World Health Organization (WHO) is pressuring manufacturers to stop making the uncompounded drug available to the medical community at large, aware of the catastrophe that would result if the malaria parasite developed resistance to artemisinins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rehwagen C |title=WHO ultimatum on artemisinin monotherapy is showing results |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7551 |pages=1176 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16709988 |pmc=1463909 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7551.1176-b}}</ref>

The [[WHO]] has recommended artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) be the first-line therapy for ''P. falciparum'' malaria worldwide.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=2006 |isbn=92-4-154694-8 }}</ref> Combinations are effective because the artemisinin component kills the majority of parasites at the start of the treatment, while the more slowly eliminated partner drug clears the remaining parasites.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Antimalarial drug resistance |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=113 |issue=8 |pages=1084–92 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15085184 |pmc=385418 |doi=10.1172/JCI21682}}</ref>

Several fixed-dose ACTs are now available containing an artemisinin component and a partner drug which has a long half-life, such as [[mefloquine]] (ASMQ<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krudsood S, Looareesuwan S, Tangpukdee N, ''et al.'' |title=New Fixed-Dose Artesunate-Mefloquine Formulation against Multidrug-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Adults: a Comparative Phase IIb Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study with Standard-Dose Nonfixed Artesunate plus Mefloquine |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume= 54|issue= 9|pages= 3730–7|year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20547795 |pmc=2935027 |doi=10.1128/AAC.01187-09 }}</ref>), [[lumefantrine]] ([[Coartem]]), [[amodiaquine]] ([[ASAQ]]), [[piperaquine]] (Duo-Cotecxin), and [[pyronaridine]] (Pyramax). Increasingly, these combinations are being made to [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]] standard. A separate issue concerns the quality of some artemisinin-containing products being sold in Africa and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6951586.stm |title=Malaria drugs recalled in Kenya |date=17 August 2007 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Newton P, Proux S, Green M, ''et al.'' |title=Fake artesunate in southeast Asia |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9272 |pages=1948–50 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11425421 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)05085-6}}</ref>

Artemisinins are not used for malaria prophylaxis (prevention) because of the extremely short activity ([[half-life]]) of the drug. To be effective, it would have to be administered multiple times each day.

===Severe malaria===
Artesunate administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection has proven superior to [[quinine]] in large, randomised controlled trials in both adults <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dondorp A, Nosten F, Stepniewska K, Day N, White N |title=Artesunate versus quinine for treatment of severe falciparum malaria: a randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9487 |pages=717–25 |year=2005 |pmid=16125588 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67176-0 |url=}}</ref> and children.<ref name="dondorp 2010">{{cite journal |author=Dondorp AM, Fanello CI, Hendriksen IC, ''et al.'' |title=Artesunate versus quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria in African children (AQUAMAT): an open-label, randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9753 |pages=1647–57 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=21062666 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61924-1 |url= |pmc=3033534}}</ref> Combining all trials comparing these two drugs, artesunate is associated with a mortality rate that is approximately 30% lower than that of quinine.<ref name="dondorp 2010" /> Reasons for this difference include reduced incidence of hypoglycaemia, easier administration and more rapid action against circulating and sequestered parasites. Artesunate is now recommended by the WHO for treatment of all cases of severe malaria.

===Cancer treatment===
Artemisinin is undergoing early research and testing for the [[experimental cancer treatment|treatment]] of [[cancer]].<ref>[http://www.uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=21353 University of Washington: News]</ref><ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/bioe/about/news/artemisinin.html University of Washington: Artemisinin]</ref> Chinese scientists have shown artemisinin has significant anticancer effects against human [[hepatoma]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hou J, Wang D, Zhang R, Wang H |year=2008 |url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18765544 |title=Experimental therapy of hepatoma with artemisinin and its derivatives: in vitro and in vivo activity, chemosensitization, and mechanisms of action |journal=Clin Cancer Res |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=5519–5530 |pmid=18765544 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0197}}</ref>  Artemisinin has a [[organic peroxide|peroxide]] [[lactone]] group in its structure, and it is thought that when the peroxide comes into contact with high iron concentrations (common in cancerous cells), the molecule becomes unstable and releases [[reactive oxygen species]]. It has been shown to reduce [[angiogenesis]] and the expression of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] in some tissue cultures. Recent pharmacological evidence demonstrates the artemisinin-derivative dihydroartemisinin targets human metastatic melanoma cells with induction of NOXA ([[phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1]])-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis that occurs downstream of iron-dependent generation of cytotoxic [[oxidative stress]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cabello CM, Lamore SD, Bair WB 3rd, Qiao S, Azimian S, Lesson JL, Wondrak GT |title=The redox antimalarial dihydroartemisinin targets human metastatic melanoma cells but not primary melanocytes with induction of NOXA-dependent apoptosis |journal=Invest.

===Helminth parasites===
Serendipitous discovery was made in China while searching for novel [[anthelmintics]] for [[schistosomiasis]]. Artemisinin was effective against [[schistosoma|schistosomes]], the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xiao SH. |title=Development of antischistosomal drugs in China, with particular consideration to praziquantel and the artemisinins |journal=Acta Trop. |volume=96 |issue=2–3 |pages=153–167 |year=2005 |pmid=16112072 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2005.07.010}}</ref> Artemisinins were later found to possess a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of [[trematodes]], including ''[[Schistosoma japonicum]]'', ''[[schistosoma mansoni|S. mansoni]]'', ''[[schistosoma haematobium|S. haematobium]]'', ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'', and ''[[Opisthorchis viverrini]]''.

== Resistance ==
Clinical evidence for artemesinin resistance was first reported in 2008 study,<ref name="pmid19064625">{{cite journal |author=Noedl H, Se Y, Schaecher K, Smith BL, Socheat D, Fukuda MM |title=Evidence of artemisinin-resistant malaria in western Cambodia |journal=N.

In April 2011, the [[WHO]] stated that resistance to the most effective antimalarial drug, artemisinin, could unravel national (India) malaria control programs, which have achieved significant progress in the last decade. WHO advocates the rational use of antimalarial drugs and acknowledges the crucial role of community health workers in reducing malaria in the region.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/23/drugs-immunity-‘may’-fail-malaria-fight.html Drugs immunity ‘may’ fail malaria fight]. The Jakarta Post, April 23, 2011.</ref>

First report of clinical evidence to decrease sensitivity to artemisinin was dated in Pailin, western Cambodia (Southeast Asia). This resistance is characterized by a slower elimination of parasite (clearance rate, CR) after treatment with artemisinin. 

Different studies were carried out during 2001 to 2010 to find a major Genome region underlying artemisinin resistance in Malaria. An area of Southwest Asia was chosen as a reference to take samples to study because it is a malaria endemic area which have started with resistance to other antimalarials.

It is compared neighboring populations of Southeast Asia, such as Laos, Thailand and Cambodia with low levels of genetic differentiation by proximity (Plasmodium falciparum strains with high similarity), but with differences in parasite clearance (CR) after treatment with artemisinin or artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs).

The conclusions of these studies are:

*One chromosome has no association with ATPase6 gene.
*There are five genes associated with resistance to other drugs: pfcrt, dhfr, pfmdr1, dhps and GTP-cyclohydrolase I.
*Identified three areas of possible association of this resistance, on chromosomes 6, 13 and 14.
*The region located on chromosome 13, contains several candidate genes and is associated with the variation in the clearance rate.

== Adverse effects ==

== Mechanism of action ==

==Dosing==
Artemisinin derivatives have half-lives of the order of an hour, and therefore require at least daily dosing over several days. For example, the WHO-approved adult dose of co-artemether (artemether-lumefantrine) is
4 tablets at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours (six doses).<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue=6 | pages=936–42 | title=Efficacy of six doses of artemether-lumefantrine (benflumetol) in multidrug-resistant ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria | author=Vugt MV, Wilairatana P, Gemperli B, ''et al.'' | pmid=10403324 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg | year=2001 | volume=64 | issue=5–6 | pages=247–56 | title=A clinical and pharmacokinetic trial of six doses of artemether-lumefantrine for multidrug-resistant ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria in Thailand | author=Lefevre G, Looareesuwan S, Treeprasertsuk S, ''et al.'' | pmid=11463111 }}</ref>

Artemisinin is not soluble in water, therefore ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' tea was postulated not to contain pharmacologically significant amounts of artemesinin.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jansen FH | title=The herbal tea approach for artemesinin as a therapy for malaria? | journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | year=2006 | volume=100 | issue=3 | pmid=16274712 | pages=285–6 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.08.004 }}</ref> However, this conclusion was rebuked by several experts who stated that hot water (85&nbsp;°C), and not boiling water, should be used to prepare the tea.

==Production and price==
China and Vietnam provide 70% and East Africa 20% of the raw plant material. Seedlings are grown in nurseries and then transplanted into fields. It takes about 8 months for them to reach full size. The plants are harvested, the leaves are dried and sent to facilities where the artemisinin is extracted using solvent, typically [[hexane]].

After negotiation with the WHO, [[Novartis]] and [[Sanofi-Aventis]] provide ACT drugs at cost on a nonprofit basis; however, these drugs are still more expensive than other malaria treatments.<ref>[http://www.york.ac.uk/org/cnap/artemisiaproject/fact_sheets_acts.htm Artemisinin combination therapies], CNAP Artemisia Project</ref> Artesunate injection for severe malaria treatment is made by the Guilin Factory in China where production has received WHO prequalification,<ref>http://www.mmv.org/partnering/guilin-pharmaceutical-─-achieving-prequalification-price-affordable-in-africa</ref>  an indicator of drug quality. 

High-yield varieties of ''Artemisia'' are being produced by the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products at the [[University of York]] using molecular breeding techniques.<ref name=aec/>

Using seed supplied by Action for Natural Medicine (ANAMED), the [[World Agroforestry Centre]] (ICRAF) has developed a hybrid, dubbed A3, which can grow to a height of 3 m and produce 20 times more artemisinin than wild varieties. In northwestern [[Mozambique]], ICRAF is working together with a medical organisation, [[Médecins sans frontières]], ANAMED and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to train farmers on how to grow the shrub from cuttings, and to harvest and dry the leaves to make artemisia tea.

In April 2013, Sanofi announced the launch of a production facility in Garessio, Italy, to manufacture the anti-plasmodial drug on a large scale, based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid, initially designed by [[Jay Keasling]] at the [[University of Berkeley]] and optimized by [[Amyris (company)|Amyris]]. The reaction is followed by a [[photochemical]] process creating singlet oxygen to obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55-60 tons in 2014. The price per kg will be $350-400, roughly the same as the botanical source.<ref>Mark Peplow (April 2013). [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/04/sanofi-launches-malaria-drug-production "Sanofi launches malaria drug production to maintain stability in Artemisinin availability"]. chemistryworld online (RSC). Retrieved April 19, 2013.</ref> Despite concerns that this equivalent source would lead to the demise of companies, which produce this substance conventionally through extraction of ''A. annua'' biomass, an increased supply of this drug will likely produce lower prices and therefore increase the availability for ACTs treatment. 

==Synthesis==

===Biosynthesis in ''A. annua''===
The biosynthesis of artemisinin is believed to involve the [[mevalonate pathway]] (MVA) and the cyclization of [[farnesyl diphosphate]] (FDP). It is not clear whether the [[non-mevalonate pathway]] pathway can also contribute 5-carbon precursors (IPP or/and DMAPP), as occurs in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. The routes from artemisinic alcohol to artemisinin remain controversial, and they differ mainly in when the reduction step takes place. Both routes suggested dihydroartemisinic acid as the final precursor to artemisinin. Dihydroartemisinic acid then undergoes photo-oxidation to produce dihydroartemisinic acid hydroperoxide. Ring expansion by the cleavage of hydroperoxide and a second oxygen-mediated hydroperoxidation finish the biosynthesis of artemisinin.

===Chemical synthesis===
The total synthesis of artemisinin, while expensive, can be performed using basic organic reagents. In 1982, G. Schmid and W. Hofheinz published a paper showing the complete synthesis of artemisinin. Their starting material was (-)-isopulegol (2), which as converted to [[methoxymethyl ether]] (3). The ether was hydroborated and then underwent oxidative workup to give (4). The primary hydroxyl group was then benzylated and the methoxymethyl ether was cleaved, resulting in (5) which would be oxidized to (6). Next, the compound was protonated and treated with (E)-(3-iodo-1-methyl-1-propenyl)-trimethylsilane to give (7). This resulting ketone was reacted with lithium methoxy(trimethylsily)methylide to obtain two diastereomeric alcohols, (8a) and (8b). The 8a was then debenzylated using (Li, {{chem|NH|3}}) to give lactone (9). The vinylsilane was then oxidized to ketone (10). The ketone was then reacted with fluoride ion that caused it to undergo [[desilylation]], enol ether formation and carboxylic acid formation to give (11). An introduction of a hydroperoxide function at C(3) of 11 gives rise to (12). Finally, this underwent [[photo-oxygenation]] and then treated with acid to produce artemisinin.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja00341a054 |author=Schmid G., Hofheinz W. |title=Total Synthesis of qinghaosu |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=624–5 |year=1983 }}</ref>

Recent advances in [[flow chemistry]] and [[photochemistry]] have highlighted an efficient method for the synthesis of artemisinin from its more plentiful biosynthetic precursor artemisinic acid, which is reduced to dihydroartemisinic acid before reacting it with [[singlet oxygen]].<ref>Lévesque F, Seeberger PH (January 2012). “Continuous-Flow Synthesis of the Anti-Malaria Drug Artemisinin”. ''Angewandte Chemie International Edition'' '''51''' (7): 1706-1709.  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201107446/abstract DOI: 10.1002/anie.201107446]</ref>

===Synthesis in engineered organisms===
In 2006, a team from UC Berkeley reported they had engineered ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' yeast to produce small amount of the precursor artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid can then be transported out, purified and chemically converted into artemisinin that they claim will cost roughly $0.25 per dose. In this effort of [[synthetic biology]], a modified [[mevalonate pathway]] was used, and the yeast cells were engineered to express the enzyme [[Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase|amorphadiene synthase]] and a [[cytochrome P450]] [[monooxygenase]] (CYP71AV1), both from ''A. annua''. A three-step oxidation of [[amorpha-4,11-diene]] gives the resulting artemisinic acid.<ref name="Ro DK, Paradise EM, Ouellet M, et al. 2006 940–3">{{cite journal |author=Ro DK, Paradise EM, Ouellet M, ''et al.'' |title=Production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7086 |pages=940–3 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16612385 |doi=10.1038/nature04640}}</ref>

[[Amyris (company)]] was engaged under a subgrant from the [[Institute for OneWorld Health]] to assist OneWorld Health develop this technology.<ref>[http://www.amyrisbiotech.com/projects_artemisinin.html Amyris Biotechnologies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The collaboration, known as the Artemisinin Project, is supported by funding from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], and aims to create a source of nonseasonal, high-quality and affordable artemisinin to supplement the botanical supply, with the objective of making ACTs more accessible. 
The Berkeley method proved impractical and too inefficient for commercial scale production, and the process was revamped using technology from various other organizations.  The final successful technology is based on inventions licensed from UC Berkeley and the National Research Council (NRC) Plant Biotechnology Institute of Canada.
