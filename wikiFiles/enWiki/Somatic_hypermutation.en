'''Somatic hypermutation''' (or SHM) is a [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] mechanism by which the [[adaptive immune system|immune system]] adapts to the new foreign elements that confront it (for example, [[microbes]]). A major component of the process of [[affinity maturation]], SHM diversifies [[B cell]] receptors used to recognize foreign elements ([[antigen]]s) and allows the immune system to adapt its response to new threats during the lifetime of an organism.<ref name="Janeway2005">{{cite book| author=Janeway, C.A., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik, M.J. |year=2005 |title=Immunobiology |edition=6th |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=0-8153-4101-6}}</ref> Somatic hypermutation involves a programmed process of [[mutation]] affecting the variable regions of [[immunoglobulin]] genes.

==Targeting==
When a [[B cell]] recognizes an antigen, it is stimulated to divide (or [[cell growth|proliferate]]). During proliferation, the [[B cell receptor]] [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] undergoes an extremely high rate of [[somatic]] mutation that is at least [[SI prefix|10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup>]] fold greater than the normal rate of mutation across the genome.<ref name= "Oprea1999"/> Variation is mainly in the form of single base substitutions, with insertions and deletions being less common. These mutations occur mostly at “hotspots” in the [[DNA]], known as [[hypervariable region]]s. These regions correspond to the [[complementarity determining region]]s; the sites involved in antigen recognition on the immunoglobulin.<ref name="Li2004">{{cite journal| author=Li, Z., Wool, C.J., Iglesias-Ussel, M.D., Ronai, D., and Scharff, M.D. |year=2004 |title=The generation of antibody diversity through somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination |journal=Genes & Development |volume=18 |pages=1–11| doi=10.1101/gad.1161904| pmid=14724175| issue=1 | url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/18/1/1.full}}</ref> The exact nature of this targeting is poorly understood, although is thought to be controlled by a balance of error-prone and high fidelity repair.<ref name="Liu2009">{{cite journal| author=Liu, M., Schatz, D.G. | year=2009 |title=Balancing AID and DNA repair during somatic hypermutation.

Experimental evidence supports the view that the mechanism of SHM involves [[deamination]] of [[cytosine]] to [[uracil]] in DNA by an enzyme called [[Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase]], or AID.<ref name="Teng2007">{{cite journal |author=Teng, G. and Papavasiliou, F.N. |year=2007 |title=Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation |journal=Annu.

Uracil residues are not normally found in DNA, therefore, to maintain the integrity of the genome most of these mutations must be repaired by high-fidelity [[DNA mismatch repair]] [[enzyme]]s. The uracil bases are removed by the repair enzyme, uracil-DNA glycosylase.<ref name="Larson2004"/> Error-prone DNA polymerases are then recruited to fill in the gap and create mutations.<ref name="Teng2007"/><ref name="Bachl2006">{{cite journal| author=Bachl, J., Ertongur, I., Jungnickel, B. |year=2006 |title=Involvement of Rad18 in somatic hypermutation |journal=Proc.

The synthesis of this new DNA involves error-prone [[DNA polymerase]]s, which often introduce mutations either at the position of the deaminated cytosine itself or neighboring [[base pair]]s. During B cell division the immunoglobulin [[hypervariable region|variable region]] DNA is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] and translated. The introduction of mutations in the rapidly-proliferating population of B cells ultimately culminates in the production of thousands of B cells, possessing slightly different receptors and varying specificity for the antigen, from which the B cell with highest [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinities]] for the antigen can be selected. The B cells with the greatest affinity will then be selected to differentiate into [[plasma cell]]s producing [[antibody]] and long-lived [[memory B cell]]s contributing to enhanced immune responses upon reinfection.<ref name= "Oprea1999"/>  

The hypermutation process also utilizes cells that auto-select against the 'signature' of an organism's own cells. It is hypothesized that failures of this auto-selection process may also lead to the development of an [[auto-immune]] response.
