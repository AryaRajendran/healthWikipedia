'''Myofascial pain syndrome''' ('''MPS'''), also known as '''chronic myofascial pain''' ('''CMP'''), is a [[syndrome]] characterized by [[chronic pain]] caused by multiple [[trigger point]]s and [[fascia]]l constrictions. Characteristic features of a myofascial trigger point include: focal point tenderness, reproduction of pain upon trigger point palpation, hardening of the muscle upon trigger point palpation, pseudo-weakness of the involved muscle, [[referred pain]], and [[Range of motion#Limited range of motion|limited range of motion]] following approximately 5 seconds of sustained trigger point pressure.<ref name=PubMed.gov>{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Robert|title=Myofascial pain syndromes and their evaluation.|journal=Best Practice & Research Clinical Rheumatology|year=2007|volume=21|issue=3|pages=427–445|pmid=17602992|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17602992|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> 

== Symptoms ==
Myofascial pain can occur in distinct, isolated areas of the body, and because any muscle or fascia may be affected, this may cause a variety of localized symptoms. More generally speaking, the muscular pain is steady, aching, and deep. Depending on the case and location the intensity can range from mild discomfort to excruciating and "lightning-like".<ref>{{cite book|last1= Starlanyl|first1= Devin J.

=== MPS and fibromyalgia ===
MPS and [[fibromyalgia]] share some common symptoms, such as [[hyperirritability]], but the two conditions are distinct. However, a patient may suffer from MPS and fibromyalgia at the same time.<ref>Starlanyl & Copeland 2001, p. 8.</ref> In fibromyalgia, chronic pain and hyperirritability are pervasive. By contrast, while MPS pain may affect many parts of the body, it is still limited to trigger points and hot spots of referred pain.<ref>Starlanyl & Copeland 2001, p. 28</ref>

== Causes ==
The precise causes of MPS are not fully documented or understood. Some [[systemic disease]]s, such as [[connective tissue disease]], can cause MPS.<ref>{{

A [[systematic review]] concluded that [[dry needling]] for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome in the lower back appeared to be a useful adjunct to standard therapies, but that clear recommendations could not be made because the published studies were small and of low quality.<ref name=cochrane>{{Cite journal|author=Furlan AD, van Tulder MW, Cherkin DC, ''et al.''|editor1-last=Furlan|editor1-first=Andrea D |title=Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain |journal=[[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD001351 |year=2005 |pmid=15674876 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001351.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD001351/frame.html|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> 

The use of [[Trigger_point#Injection|Trigger Point Injections]] using local anaesthetic such as [[Lidocaine]] is a controversial treatment with many anaesthetists not willing to perform them due to their belief of the technique being able to provide relief or due to little knowledge of Myofascial Pain Syndrome and how to perform TPIs{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}. The treatment has been found effective in regards to patients finding longer term relief after a few sessions or regular TPIs providing relief from pain substantial to reduce the use of severe pain medications like [[Oxycodone]] or [[Tramadol]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

Posture evaluation and [[ergonomics]] may provide significant relief in the early stages of treatment.<ref>Starlanyl & Copeland 2001, p. 230</ref> Movement therapies such as [[Alexander Technique]] and [[Feldenkrais Method]] may also be helpful.<ref>Starlanyl & Copeland 2001, p. 232.</ref>
