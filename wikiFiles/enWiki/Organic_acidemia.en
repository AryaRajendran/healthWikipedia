'''Organic acidemia''', also called '''organic aciduria''', is a term used to classify a group of [[inborn error of metabolism|metabolic disorders]] which disrupt normal [[amino acid metabolism]], particularly [[branched-chain amino acids]], causing a buildup of acids which are usually not present.<ref name="bcoa">{{cite journal |author=Ogier de Baulny H, Saudubray JM |title=Branched-chain organic acidurias |journal=Semin Neonatol. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |year=2002 |pmid=12069539 |doi=10.1053/siny.2001.0087 }}</ref>

The branched-chain amino acids include [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]] and [[valine]].<ref name="bcoa" /> [[Organic acid]]s refer to the [[amino acid]]s and certain odd-chained [[fatty acid]]s which are affected by these disorders.

The four main types of organic acidemia are: [[methylmalonic acidemia]], [[propionic acidemia]], [[isovaleric acidemia]], and [[maple syrup urine disease]].<ref name="bcoa" />

==Diagnosis and Symptoms==
Organic acidemias are usually diagnosed in infancy, characterized by urinary excretion of abnormal amounts or types of [[organic acid]]s. The diagnosis is usually made by detecting an abnormal pattern of [[urine organic acids|organic acids]] in a urine sample by [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]]. In some conditions, the urine is always abnormal, in others the characteristic substances are only present intermittently. Many of the organic acidemias are detectable by [[newborn screening]] with tandem mass spectrometry.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dionisi-Vici C, Deodato F, Raschinger W, Rhead W, Wilcken B |title=Classical organic acidurias, propionic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria, and isovaleric aciduria: long-term outcome and effects of expanded newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry |journal=J Inherit Metab Dis. |volume=29 |issue=2–3 |pages=383–389 |year=2006 |pmid=16763906 |doi=10.1007/s10545-006-0278-z }}</ref>

These disorders vary in their [[prognosis]], from manageable to fatal, and usually affect more than one [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] system, especially the [[central nervous system]].

Neurological damage and [[developmental delay]] are common factors in diagnosis, with associated symptoms ranging from [[poor feeding]] to slow [[Human development (biology)|growth]], [[lethargy]], [[vomiting]],
[[dehydration]], [[malnutrition]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypotonia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], [[ketoacidosis]], [[hyperammonemia]], and if left untreated, [[death]].

==Cause==
Most of the organic acidemias result from defective [[autosome|autosomal]] [[gene]]s for various [[enzyme]]s important to amino acid [[metabolism]]. Neurological and physiological harm is caused by this impaired ability to synthesize a key enzyme required to break down a specific amino acid, or group of amino acids, resulting in acidemia and toxicity to specific organs systems. Most are inherited as [[autosomal recessive]] diseases.

==Treatment==
Treatment or management of organic acidemias vary. There are no effective treatments for all of the conditions, though treatment for some may include a limited [[protein]]/high [[carbohydrate]] diet, [[intravenous fluid]]s, amino acid substitution, vitamin supplementation, carnitine, induced [[anabolism]],<ref name="oat">{{cite journal |author=Saudubray JM, Ogier H, Charpentier C, Depondt E, Couda FX, Munnich A, Mitchell G, Rey F, Rey J, Frazal J |title=Hudson memorial lecture.
